label_comment_1
In this comment, Prof. Nonacs gives his view of the inclusive fitness controversy and related
issues, partly through the lens of two recent papers: Olejarz et al (2015, eLife) and Davies and
Gardner (2018, Royal Society Open Science).
Olejarz et al (2015) analysed a model of the evolution of voluntary worker non-reproduction in
haplodiploid insect societies and found that monogamy sometimes promotes and sometimes
inhibits the evolution of worker sterility. Davies and Gardner (2018) analysed the same model
and found that the results of Olejarz et al. were due to restrictive assumptions concerning the
genetics of worker sterility. When we (Davies and Gardner) relaxed these assumptions, we found
that monogamy actually has a clear promoting effect on the evolution of worker sterility.
I have to say that I don't agree entirely with Prof. Nonacs' interpretation of my paper, but I do
appreciate that he is trying to propose a way forward here and so I'll mainly restrict myself in this
review to commenting on what I see as a few small matters of factual correctness. I don't think
any of these problems are fundamental to what is being said in this comment piece more
generally, but do need to be addressed.
Lines 82–84: "Davies and Gardner [24] expanded this analysis by allowing sterility alleles to be
intermediate in their effect and beneficial to the queen in allowing her to gain more
reproduction."
The first part of this sentence is right, but the second part doesn't seem right to me. Olejarz et al.
made the assumption that the p_z function (proportion of male eggs produced by the queen)
would be an increasing function of z. We adopted the same assumption. Therefore I don't think
this can be described as a way in which we extended the analysis of Olejarz et al. To be clear, we
did extend their analysis, but we did so by (1) allowing sterility alleles to be intermediate in their
effect, (2) considering the long-term evolution of worker sterility rather than the short term
invasibility of particular alleles, and (3) looking at a broader range of worker sterility scenarios.
On a related note, further up in this paragraph, it is stated that Olejarz et al. assumed that "the
production of [worker-derived] males competes with and possibly reduces the number of males
that are queen-produced." This is technically right but I think phrased in a way that could be
clearer. Olejarz et al. made the assumption that queen male production increases with worker
sterility, so I feel like the word "possibly" isn't quite right here. Overall production depends on
both r_z and p_z, so you *could* get a situation where worker sterility causes everyone's
production to decrease (decreasing r_z), which *could* reduce the queen's male production
overall (depending on p_z), but I think overall the way this is described here might be a little
confusing to readers.
Lines 92–94: Davies and Gardner [24] respond to Olejarz et al [12] by declaring that "monogamy
always promotes... worker sterility" without qualifying that this requires traits to be expressed
additively..."
We spend quite a lot of the paper exploring alternative scenarios in which worker sterility is
3
dominant or recessive, so I don't know where this is coming from—we absolutely do not require
traits to be expressed additively.
Lines 124–126: "The degree to which parents or siblings can impose complete or almost complete
sterility on their group mates will determine whether the Olejarz et al. [12] or Davies and
Gardner [24] models are more appropriate."
I'm not sure I understand this—we make the same assumptions as Olejarz et al when it comes to
who is controlling sterility, so I don't think whether parents or siblings can impose sterility on
their group mates has anything to do with whether our analysis is more appropriate than Olejarz
et al.'s.
Finally, I wonder if the author would consider toning down the last paragraph just a little. I have
always appreciated Prof. Nonacs' point of view, which has come to me through peer review a
couple of times, and I appreciate that he makes his points in a measured way and does not seek to
bury papers that he disagrees with. I also agree in general with the assessment in this paragraph
that diversity of opinion can be fruitful and that excessive dogmatism is unhelpful. But I don't
think I or my coauthor can fairly be described as people who consider "proving their opponents
wrong" to be the most important thing, and it feels a bit like that is what is being said here. I
worked on this paper during my PhD and I would never want to discourage anyone from
wanting to study social evolution. In fact, I met with Carl Veller (one of the authors on Olejarz et
al, who was a PhD student like me at the time) in person to ask him for feedback on the paper,
and because I didn't want the authors—especially the less senior ones—to feel like there was any
bad blood between us. So although I'm sure this wasn't Prof. Nonacs' intention, the final
paragraph feels a little bit unfair to me.
Best wishes,
Nick Davies

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This manuscript evaluates the extent to which monogamy promotes altruistic cooperation. It is
not completely clear to me why Peter Nonacs appears to feel that there are scientific reasons for
considering possible alternatives to inclusive fitness theory for explaining patterns and processes
of social evolution, which he does in practice in spite of his closing sentence. Apart from the
reference to Nowak et al (2010) nothing in his own work (which appears in several hypothesis-
ideas towards the end of the manuscript) seems to justify that. I therefore believe that much of
this essay sees controversy and disagreement where there in fact is none, provided one is clear
about terms and definitions and the ways in which they were messed up when sociobiology
became influential.
In the four comments below I attempt to clarify this overall assessment. After that I provide
specific comments with reference to line numbers:
1. Nowak et al. (2010) has nothing to do with the topic at hand. The reference to the Nowak et al.
(2010) paper at the start of this manuscript is odd. That paper ignored the monogamy hypothesis
(in spite of two Boomsma reviews of 2007 and 2009) having laid it out in considerable detail and
the Science paper by Hughes et al. (2008) having shown it was supported by considerable
empirical evidence. The Nowak et al. challenge of inclusive fitness theory was thoroughly refuted
by a series of 5 rebuttals of which only one (Boomsma et al., 2011) explicitly addressed
monogamy – the total number of authors involved was ca. 150 (not 134 as Nonacs states). The
agenda of the Nowak et al. paper failed, because a scientific challenge of a major paradigm needs
to achieve two things: 1. It needs to allow easy understanding of all insights already validated
under the previous paradigm (in this case the 16 subfields listed with triple ‘yes’ in Table 1 of the
Abbot et al. rebuttal that summarized the overwhelming empirical and modelling confirmation of
inclusive fitness theory), and 2. Such a challenge needs to add a series of new testable predictions
that were not valid questions under the existing paradigm, and that would have sufficient initial
support to open up entire new research fields. This is what relativity theory (Einstein) and
quantum theory (Bohr) did when they built on and enriched Newton mechanics. Nothing like
that was achieved by Nowak et al. (2010). Their statement of ‘meagre’ support is simply wrong.
Neither did their paper allow the recapture of any previous understanding or generate a single
novel testable prediction. It therefore seems inappropriate to start the introduction of the present
manuscript with Nowak et al. (2010). It would also be nice if Nonacs could actually mention more
explicitly that the monogamy hypothesis has been very well supported by empirical data, not
unexpectedly as it is in fact just an extension of Hamilton’s rule and the inclusive fitness theory
behind.
2. Nonacs’ formulation of the central prediction of the monogamy hypothesis is incorrect. Nonacs
appears to misrepresent what the monogamy hypothesis actually predicts. He is not the only one,
because the Hughes et al. (Science 2008) paper testing the empirical evidence as provided by the
then available comparative data is actually not very precise in how it phrased the idea being
tested. If Nonacs is interested in evaluating the status of the monogamy hypothesis, he should
therefore go back to its exact formulation by Boomsma, both in the first review cited by Hughes
at al. (Current Biology 2007) and reread the precise phrasing in the review paper that he cites
(Boomsma 2009). That should reveal that the monogamy hypothesis was ONLY meant to explain
the evolution of life-time physically differentiated castes, not the evolution of all altruistic
cooperation as the title of the present Nonacs manuscript suggests. It was stated explicitly that
this concerned the evolution of superorganismality sensu Wheeler, which Boomsma coined
‘obligate eusociality’ struggling with the ‘eusociality definition’ that Wilsonian sociobiology had
left the field with. It has become increasing clear (and has been expressed in increasingly explicit
5
language by Boomsma (2009, 2013), Boomsma, Huszár & Pedersen (2014), and Boomsma &
Gawne (2018) that sociobiology terminology is a smokescreen because its ‘eusociality’ does not
discriminate between first helpers at the nest and life-time differentiated castes. The monogamy
hypothesis never claimed to explain all aspects of what determined first helpers at the nest. It is
about predicting the emergence of obligate altruism, not of facultative (condition-dependent)
forms of altruism (facultative eusociality in the Boomsma reviews). Nonacs has made this
interpretational mistake in his earlier modelling papers, which he now admits (e.g. nest
inheritance), but his present text continues to repeat some of the same misapprehensions. His
arguments thus acquire several strawman characteristics and they are already apparent in the
title of the manuscript (the monogamy hypothesis is not about cooperation because reproductive
altruism <U+2260> cooperation).
3. Assumptions should be explicit and biologically realistic for models to be meaningful. It is of
crucial importance for evaluating the assumptions that go into any model meant to describe the
evolutionary origin of different types of altruistic phenoptypes. The previous Nonacs models
have always addressed the origin of helpers at the nest, not the origin of obligatory altruistic
castes, i.e. the irreversible transition to Wheeler-superorganismality which implies that ALL
colony members belong to a single adult caste phenotype for life. The monogamy hypothesis
never intended to challenge the recurrent origins of facultative (condition-dependent) altruism
through the simple logic of Hamilton’s rule (rb>c). If all three variables vary freely there can be
situations where lower than full–sib relatedness still allowed some offspring to become helpers at
the nest, for example because they were poorly endowed as adult phenotypes (maternal
manipulation could play a role here, but note that mothers also need to weigh how they get most
genes passed on to grand-offspring by making offspring disperse rather than stay). However,
what the life-time monogamy hypothesis states is that it cannot be expected that this will ever
lead to the evolution of permanently unmated workers (true workers as termite researchers aptly
call them; neuters as Darwin and Wheeler conceptualized them). The monogamy hypothesis is
about the evolution of obligate (unconditional) altruism, a distinction that is not made in the
Hughes et al (2008) paper but that is explicit in the Boomsma reviews. Most examples that
Nonacs highlights are about the origin of first helpers at the nest, and none is about helping
behaviour going to fixation so that physically differentiated permanent castes appear. If Nonacs
would make that distinction, most of the rationale for his critique would seem to disappear. The
same rationale as outlined here also pervaded the recent Davies and Gardner paper, so the
Nonacs critique appears to compare apples and oranges. A recent modelling paper by Quinones
& Pen (Nature Communications, 2017) also shows clearly that strict monogamy is a necessary
condition for the evolution of obligate, not facultative reproductive altruism. The Nonacs (2011,
2014) papers thus appear to have their assumptions wrong for them to be relevant as tests of the
monogamy hypotheses for permanent castes – they address the evolution of first helpers.
4. The proposed ‘alternative’ hypotheses towards the end of the manuscript. Some of these
appear to be interesting research agendas, but others seem rather far-fetched and lack more than
hand-waving justification. More importantly, however, very few if any of them are directly
relevant for testing the monogamy hypothesis in its original meaning.
I hope the following line-by-line comments will clarify these general points.
Line 26: ‘eusociality’ here lumps societies and superorganisms, which Boomsma & Gawne show
are fundamentally different social systems, going back to Darwin, Weismann, Wheeler, Fisher,
Williams and others all the way through the 1960s, until sociobiology started to water down and
muddle these definitions. The Boomsma reviews (particularly 2013) also make this point,
emphasizing that Crespi & Yanega (1995) and Beekman et al (2006) also criticized the ‘eusociality
continuum’ ideas emanating from the watered down definitions by E.O. Wilson in the 1970s.
6
Line 29: Refs 9+10+12 had their modelling assumptions wrong for the monogamy hypothesis as
originally formulated by Boomsma, which ref. 12 partly rectifies and the recent Davies&Gardner
paper makes more explicit. You also admit that later on, but without stating the explicit reasons.
There is also a semantic issue here. Empirical data can never be ‘put to mathematical tests’, not
even in physics. Mathematical models can be used to derive predictions from axiomatic
assumptions that can then be empirically tested, not the other way around. Being precise about
this distinction is crucial particularly in evolutionary biology, where the main function of models
is to make sense of empirically observed variation in social behaviours and life-histories –
anything beyond that is illusionary.
Line 30: The monogamy hypothesis is not about the evolution of cooperation (for mutual
benefits) but about the evolution of obligate reproductive altruism. What Hughes et al. (2008) and
Cornwallis et al. (2010) tested was whether low parental promiscuity favors facultative
reproductive reproductive altruism (with for social insects obligate reproductive altruism as a
putative later extension). They never tested the hypothesis in its most stringent version originally
proposed.
Line 32-33: When you conceptualize the evolution of permanent true worker castes as an
evolutionary point of no return (i.e. a major evolutionary transition), as all Boomsma reviews
since 2007 have done, the later transitions to multiple queen mating and polygyny (the latter
primarily in ants – see Boomsma, Huszár & Pedersen, Animal Behaviour 2014) are not relevant
for the argument, because by then true worker castes could no longer go back to facultative
(condition-dependent) altruism. Also here ‘cooperative behaviour’ is an inaccurate description of
what the monogamy hypothesis is about (same in Line 35).
Line 35-40: Once more, the monogamy hypothesis is not about these cases. If daughters stay to
help even though they could have dispersed, there is no reason to question that they do that
because the inequality specified by Hamilton’s rule compels them to do so. Because these cases
represent facultative altruism, it is expected that measured average direct and indirect fitnesses
are in fact equal (representing a frequency dependent ESS equilibrium where both strategies do
equally well). This is what the cited studies report and it is all consistent with inclusive fitness
theory, even though the papers try to argue otherwise – very little if anything in these decision
making processes can be shown to be maladaptive or challenging established inclusive fitness
theory (line 41-42). But the main issue is that none of this challenges the monogamy hypothesis
for its prediction of major evolutionary transitions to superorganismality as defined by Wheeler
(Boomsma & Gawne, 2018).
Line 44: The above implies there is no dissonance between theory and empirical results as
implied here, provided one phrases the predictions and assumptions of the Boomsma hypothesis
correctly, rather than forcing them into uninformative sociobiology jargon that Boomsma tried to
avoid.
Line 50: Again, the argument is not about cooperation but about reproductive altruism.
Line 56-58: How do you define ‘a species’ sociobiology’? It would seem preferable to me to avoid
vague language like this. Once more all of this is about the expression of condition-dependent
facultative altruism with or without simultaneous direct fitness gains (captured by mutualistic
cooperation) – nothing of what is here appears to challenge the monogamy hypothesis for the
evolution of obligate reproductive altruism.
Line 59-63: Also this point seems misplaced as criticism of the monogamy hypothesis, because it
7
seems to represent a ‘parasocial’ arrangement, which the Boomsma reviews explicitly excluded as
ancestral state for the evolution of superorganismality in the Wheeler sense.
Line 63-67: This makes sense to me, but it is perhaps premature to highlight here based on just a
submitted paper, particularly because all of this seems consistent with the Hamiltonian paradigm
that ecology (the b/c ration in Hamilton’s rule) is as decisive as the relatedness terms when all
three vary at the same time, as is always the case when evaluating cases of condition-dependent
expression of facultative reproductive altruism. All the monogamy hypothesis did was claim that
maximal and invariable relatedness was a necessary condition for making major evolutionary
transitions to obligate reproductive altruism with permanently unmated workers – so for this
kind of transitions relatedness comes first, cancels out of Hamilton’s rule, so that b/c >1 comes to
represent the sufficient condition for actually making such transitions. A recent paper (Smith,
Kent, Boomsma, Stow, Nature Ecology and Evolution 2018) shows that this proof of concept
works fine to explain the evolution of life-time unmated workers in an ambrosia beetle – the
commentary by Nick Davies summarizes that very well.
Line 67-69: I think this point has been made earlier in a Keller and Reeve model – all fine. It just
has no direct bearing on the assumptions and predictions of the Boomsma monogamy
hypothesis.
Line 70: ‘Recently the monogamy debate has extended …’ ?? If you carefully read the Boomsma
reviews all the way back to 2007 you will see that this was the core of the argument right from the
start – even though the language was made more explicit in later reviews. Ref 10 confuses the
evolution of first helpers at the nest with the point of no return to obligate reproductive altruism,
which are very different things. Even though some others have also confused these issues in
previous papers, you cannot hold the logic presented by Boomsma responsible for that confusion.
Line 75-76: No, of course not. But maternal manipulation is only a (partial) alternative
explanation to voluntary reproductive altruism in social systems where some nests retain helpers
and other nests do not. All those dynamics are covered by the classic dynamics of Hamilton’s rule
and have no bearing on the monogamy hypothesis as formulated for the evolution of life-time
unmated nursing castes.
Line 76-87: For all I know, Davies & Gardner showed that the Olejarz et al. model was
unsatisfactory because it worked with caricature single locus variation with extreme phenotypic
effects. Ever since Alan Grafen wrote his well-known phenotypic gambit paper in the 1980s the
field has been clear about complex social traits being largely independent of such single locus
extreme effects. Making models of that kind (as Olejarz, Nonacs, and some others like to do),
therefore has possible bearing on the first (facultative) expression of reproductive altruism, but
not on the evolution of permanently sterile castes, which requires significant rewiring of complex
gene-regulation networks depending on many genes with small effects. That is why social traits
are best considered to have quantitative genetic variation with overall heritabilities that
determine how such traits respond to selection, but without significant single-gene effects. I
would think this should also apply to many cases of the expression of facultative helping when
governed by the type of phenotypic plasticity proposed by Mary Jane West Eberhard. Also here it
is hard to conceptualize how complex behavioural reaction norms are dependent on single locus
variation with extreme phenotypic effects.
Line 98-100: I disagree with this blanket statement, because it suggests that all arguments have
equal merits across the board. The Boomsma monogamy hypothesis has met with unambiguous
support for the predictions that it actually made (major transitions to Wheeler
superorganismality and to obligate multicellularity cf. Fisher, Cornwallis & West, Current
Biology 2013). Other models, among them some by Nonacs, have shown that things are more
8
complex for facultative reproductive altruism. Under the assumptions stated, these models are
likely correct, but they are not at variance with the monogamy hypothesis as original framed.
They shed light on cases of haplodiploid cooperative breeding and complement more general
insights in (usually diploid) cooperative breeding in other arthropods and vertebrates. When
taking that broader perspective, haplodiploidy is actually quite an idiosyncratic issue, because it
implies that unmatedness does not necessarily imply sterility as it does in diploids. I think also
that should be taken into account when evaluating the merits of a loser version of the monogamy
hypothesis that has now been tested and found to be essentially correct in many diploid
cooperative breeders (alpaeid shrimp, cooperatively breeding birds, cooperatively breeding
mammals, etc – see recent Boomsma reviews for references).
Line 104-142: This list is likely to be in need of qualifications as current relevance seems doubtful.
1. Bourke & Franks (1995) argue that maternal manipulation is essentially a Hamiltonian concept,
as was agreed upon by Richard Alexander, so any discussion of the validity of this idea should be
framed in that context. Also manipulating mothers are under selection to maximize their
inclusive fitness, so manipulating provisioning of daughters in their larval stages so they stay
should not give mothers fewer grandchildren than provisioning them optimally so they can
disperse and breed. 2. So far ‘social heterosis’ has never been shown to play a role empirically for
facultative reproductive altruism; it has for obligate altruism in honeybees and leaf-cutting ants
with obligate multiple queen mating. It seems crucial to acknowledge that distinction. 3. I do not
think it is appropriate to capture humans and paper wasps under the same heading – overall
none of these two systems seem relevant for the monogamy hypothesis as originally framed. 4.
This seems misguided because the monogamy hypothesis is about obligate reproductive altruism
(and in fact obligate multicellular soma as well) evolving ‘voluntarily’. That is why maximal
(invariable) relatedness is key because it makes the r-terms cancel out of Hamilton’s rule. That
makes the power issue brought up here moot. The Davies & Gardner model acknowledges that,
any model coming out of Nowak’s group does not. 5. As far as ‘groups’ are parasocial
aggregations, this argument is irrelevant for the monogamy hypothesis which requires colony
founding by a life-time monogamous pair. 6. Also this point seems hardly relevant, because
outbreeding is normally secured in social systems. The few cases in which societies have
offspring hanging around that do not obtain indirect fitness are irrelevant for the monogamy
hypothesis. As Michael Griesser argued (recent PLOS Biology paper) there are forms of family
life that essentially represent extended parental care. They will imply interesting social dynamics,
but there is no relevance to the monogamy hypothesis when offspring do not help to obtain
indirect fitness benefits. 7+8. Also these topics do not seem relevant for the monogamy
hypothesis. They are of interest, but have been of interest ever since inclusive fitness theory was
proposed so are hardly novel; antagonistic interlocus genetics remains poorly understood even in
sexual selection research – it seems hardly relevant as a pressing research agenda here.
In sum, the title of the paper is too broad for the issues the paper actually evaluates. The
monogamy hypothesis was never about cooperation for mutual direct fitness benefits, but only
about the evolution of obligate reproductive altruism. Suggesting it was more by using
‘cooperation’ muddles the water. Many of these 1-8 topics are of interest, but just not in the
context at hand.
Line 145-149: All valuable scientific theory is dogmatic. How else would Einstein and Bohr have
succeeded replacing Newton mechanics? G.C. Williams explicitly emphasized the need for
biological theory to also be stringent, so its predictions are vulnerable to falsification – that is why
he explicitly endorsed inclusive fitness theory in his 1966 book Adaptation and Natural Selection.
Neither I nor any others who have developed or tested the monogamy hypothesis have ever
claimed it will be relevant for any social system. However, the framing has been increasingly
precise about what is predicted and what is not (see particularly Boomsma reviews from 2013,
9
2014 and 2018), and these exclude scenarios involving the expression of facultative reproductive
altruism with less than maximal sibling relatedness or cooperation for mutual direct benefits.
Line 149-153: As far as I am aware we know of no examples where ‘emergent group level
benefits’ have been shown to challenge inclusive fitness theory. In general, any invocation of
‘emergence’ is unhelpful for scientific progress. As J.B.S. Haldane wrote: ‘Particularly hostile to
true scientific progress are the extremer forms of emergence ….. [S]cience is committed to the
attempt to unify human experience by explaining the complex in terms of the simple - The
Causes of Evolution (1932). I think Peter Nonacs adheres to this principle when he closes off
writing “Trust in inclusive fitness, but verify”. However, it would then help for maintaining
transparency in the literature if he would refrain from sociobiology terminology that was never
intended to accurately capture the assumptions and predictions of inclusive fitness theory, and
from using strawman versions of extensions of inclusive fitness theory to line up arguments that
do not address real issues.

Not surprisingly, there are strong differences here; I believe the reviewers will respect differences
of analysis, but please make sure that you are getting the original literature correct, because they
maintain that in several important places you are not (you may of course show them wrong). If
you need more time than that allotted to revise, please let us know. Thanks and good luck.

Comments to the Author(s)
In this comment, Prof. Nonacs gives his view of the inclusive fitness controversy and related
issues, partly through the lens of two recent papers: Olejarz et al (2015, eLife) and Davies and
Gardner (2018, Royal Society Open Science).
Olejarz et al (2015) analysed a model of the evolution of voluntary worker non-reproduction in
haplodiploid insect societies and found that monogamy sometimes promotes and sometimes
inhibits the evolution of worker sterility. Davies and Gardner (2018) analysed the same model
and found that the results of Olejarz et al. were due to restrictive assumptions concerning the
genetics of worker sterility. When we (Davies and Gardner) relaxed these assumptions, we found
that monogamy actually has a clear promoting effect on the evolution of worker sterility.
I have to say that I don't agree entirely with Prof. Nonacs' interpretation of my paper, but I do
12
appreciate that he is trying to propose a way forward here and so I'll mainly restrict myself in this
review to commenting on what I see as a few small matters of factual correctness. I don't think
any of these problems are fundamental to what is being said in this comment piece more
generally, but do need to be addressed.
Lines 82–84: "Davies and Gardner [24] expanded this analysis by allowing sterility alleles to be
intermediate in their effect and beneficial to the queen in allowing her to gain more
reproduction."
The first part of this sentence is right, but the second part doesn't seem right to me. Olejarz et al.
made the assumption that the p_z function (proportion of male eggs produced by the queen)
would be an increasing function of z. We adopted the same assumption. Therefore I don't think
this can be described as a way in which we extended the analysis of Olejarz et al. To be clear, we
did extend their analysis, but we did so by (1) allowing sterility alleles to be intermediate in their
effect, (2) considering the long-term evolution of worker sterility rather than the short term
invasibility of particular alleles, and (3) looking at a broader range of worker sterility scenarios.
On a related note, further up in this paragraph, it is stated that Olejarz et al. assumed that "the
production of [worker-derived] males competes with and possibly reduces the number of males
that are queen-produced." This is technically right but I think phrased in a way that could be
clearer. Olejarz et al. made the assumption that queen male production increases with worker
sterility, so I feel like the word "possibly" isn't quite right here. Overall production depends on
both r_z and p_z, so you *could* get a situation where worker sterility causes everyone's
production to decrease (decreasing r_z), which *could* reduce the queen's male production
overall (depending on p_z), but I think overall the way this is described here might be a little
confusing to readers.
Lines 92–94: Davies and Gardner [24] respond to Olejarz et al [12] by declaring that "monogamy
always promotes... worker sterility" without qualifying that this requires traits to be expressed
additively..."
We spend quite a lot of the paper exploring alternative scenarios in which worker sterility is
dominant or recessive, so I don't know where this is coming from—we absolutely do not require
traits to be expressed additively.
Lines 124–126: "The degree to which parents or siblings can impose complete or almost complete
sterility on their group mates will determine whether the Olejarz et al. [12] or Davies and
Gardner [24] models are more appropriate."
I'm not sure I understand this—we make the same assumptions as Olejarz et al when it comes to
who is controlling sterility, so I don't think whether parents or siblings can impose sterility on
their group mates has anything to do with whether our analysis is more appropriate than Olejarz
et al.'s.
Finally, I wonder if the author would consider toning down the last paragraph just a little. I have
always appreciated Prof. Nonacs' point of view, which has come to me through peer review a
couple of times, and I appreciate that he makes his points in a measured way and does not seek to
bury papers that he disagrees with. I also agree in general with the assessment in this paragraph
that diversity of opinion can be fruitful and that excessive dogmatism is unhelpful. But I don't
think I or my coauthor can fairly be described as people who consider "proving their opponents
wrong" to be the most important thing, and it feels a bit like that is what is being said here. I
worked on this paper during my PhD and I would never want to discourage anyone from
wanting to study social evolution. In fact, I met with Carl Veller (one of the authors on Olejarz et
13
al, who was a PhD student like me at the time) in person to ask him for feedback on the paper,
and because I didn't want the authors—especially the less senior ones—to feel like there was any
bad blood between us. So although I'm sure this wasn't Prof. Nonacs' intention, the final
paragraph feels a little bit unfair to me.
Best wishes,
Nick Davies

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript evaluates the extent to which monogamy promotes altruistic cooperation. It is
not completely clear to me why Peter Nonacs appears to feel that there are scientific reasons for
considering possible alternatives to inclusive fitness theory for explaining patterns and processes
of social evolution, which he does in practice in spite of his closing sentence. Apart from the
reference to Nowak et al (2010) nothing in his own work (which appears in several hypothesis-
ideas towards the end of the manuscript) seems to justify that. I therefore believe that much of
this essay sees controversy and disagreement where there in fact is none, provided one is clear
about terms and definitions and the ways in which they were messed up when sociobiology
became influential.
In the four comments below I attempt to clarify this overall assessment. After that I provide
specific comments with reference to line numbers:
1. Nowak et al. (2010) has nothing to do with the topic at hand. The reference to the Nowak et al.
(2010) paper at the start of this manuscript is odd. That paper ignored the monogamy hypothesis
(in spite of two Boomsma reviews of 2007 and 2009) having laid it out in considerable detail and
the Science paper by Hughes et al. (2008) having shown it was supported by considerable
empirical evidence. The Nowak et al. challenge of inclusive fitness theory was thoroughly refuted
by a series of 5 rebuttals of which only one (Boomsma et al., 2011) explicitly addressed
monogamy – the total number of authors involved was ca. 150 (not 134 as Nonacs states). The
agenda of the Nowak et al. paper failed, because a scientific challenge of a major paradigm needs
to achieve two things: 1. It needs to allow easy understanding of all insights already validated
under the previous paradigm (in this case the 16 subfields listed with triple ‘yes’ in Table 1 of the
Abbot et al. rebuttal that summarized the overwhelming empirical and modelling confirmation of
inclusive fitness theory), and 2. Such a challenge needs to add a series of new testable predictions
that were not valid questions under the existing paradigm, and that would have sufficient initial
support to open up entire new research fields. This is what relativity theory (Einstein) and
quantum theory (Bohr) did when they built on and enriched Newton mechanics. Nothing like
that was achieved by Nowak et al. (2010). Their statement of ‘meagre’ support is simply wrong.
Neither did their paper allow the recapture of any previous understanding or generate a single
novel testable prediction. It therefore seems inappropriate to start the introduction of the present
manuscript with Nowak et al. (2010). It would also be nice if Nonacs could actually mention more
explicitly that the monogamy hypothesis has been very well supported by empirical data, not
unexpectedly as it is in fact just an extension of Hamilton’s rule and the inclusive fitness theory
behind.
2. Nonacs’ formulation of the central prediction of the monogamy hypothesis is incorrect. Nonacs
appears to misrepresent what the monogamy hypothesis actually predicts. He is not the only one,
because the Hughes et al. (Science 2008) paper testing the empirical evidence as provided by the
then available comparative data is actually not very precise in how it phrased the idea being
tested. If Nonacs is interested in evaluating the status of the monogamy hypothesis, he should
14
therefore go back to its exact formulation by Boomsma, both in the first review cited by Hughes
at al. (Current Biology 2007) and reread the precise phrasing in the review paper that he cites
(Boomsma 2009). That should reveal that the monogamy hypothesis was ONLY meant to explain
the evolution of life-time physically differentiated castes, not the evolution of all altruistic
cooperation as the title of the present Nonacs manuscript suggests. It was stated explicitly that
this concerned the evolution of superorganismality sensu Wheeler, which Boomsma coined
‘obligate eusociality’ struggling with the ‘eusociality definition’ that Wilsonian sociobiology had
left the field with. It has become increasing clear (and has been expressed in increasingly explicit
language by Boomsma (2009, 2013), Boomsma, Huszár & Pedersen (2014), and Boomsma &
Gawne (2018) that sociobiology terminology is a smokescreen because its ‘eusociality’ does not
discriminate between first helpers at the nest and life-time differentiated castes. The monogamy
hypothesis never claimed to explain all aspects of what determined first helpers at the nest. It is
about predicting the emergence of obligate altruism, not of facultative (condition-dependent)
forms of altruism (facultative eusociality in the Boomsma reviews). Nonacs has made this
interpretational mistake in his earlier modelling papers, which he now admits (e.g. nest
inheritance), but his present text continues to repeat some of the same misapprehensions. His
arguments thus acquire several strawman characteristics and they are already apparent in the
title of the manuscript (the monogamy hypothesis is not about cooperation because reproductive
altruism <U+2260> cooperation).
3. Assumptions should be explicit and biologically realistic for models to be meaningful. It is of
crucial importance for evaluating the assumptions that go into any model meant to describe the
evolutionary origin of different types of altruistic phenoptypes. The previous Nonacs models
have always addressed the origin of helpers at the nest, not the origin of obligatory altruistic
castes, i.e. the irreversible transition to Wheeler-superorganismality which implies that ALL
colony members belong to a single adult caste phenotype for life. The monogamy hypothesis
never intended to challenge the recurrent origins of facultative (condition-dependent) altruism
through the simple logic of Hamilton’s rule (rb>c). If all three variables vary freely there can be
situations where lower than full–sib relatedness still allowed some offspring to become helpers at
the nest, for example because they were poorly endowed as adult phenotypes (maternal
manipulation could play a role here, but note that mothers also need to weigh how they get most
genes passed on to grand-offspring by making offspring disperse rather than stay). However,
what the life-time monogamy hypothesis states is that it cannot be expected that this will ever
lead to the evolution of permanently unmated workers (true workers as termite researchers aptly
call them; neuters as Darwin and Wheeler conceptualized them). The monogamy hypothesis is
about the evolution of obligate (unconditional) altruism, a distinction that is not made in the
Hughes et al (2008) paper but that is explicit in the Boomsma reviews. Most examples that
Nonacs highlights are about the origin of first helpers at the nest, and none is about helping
behaviour going to fixation so that physically differentiated permanent castes appear. If Nonacs
would make that distinction, most of the rationale for his critique would seem to disappear. The
same rationale as outlined here also pervaded the recent Davies and Gardner paper, so the
Nonacs critique appears to compare apples and oranges. A recent modelling paper by Quinones
& Pen (Nature Communications, 2017) also shows clearly that strict monogamy is a necessary
condition for the evolution of obligate, not facultative reproductive altruism. The Nonacs (2011,
2014) papers thus appear to have their assumptions wrong for them to be relevant as tests of the
monogamy hypotheses for permanent castes – they address the evolution of first helpers.
4. The proposed ‘alternative’ hypotheses towards the end of the manuscript. Some of these
appear to be interesting research agendas, but others seem rather far-fetched and lack more than
hand-waving justification. More importantly, however, very few if any of them are directly
relevant for testing the monogamy hypothesis in its original meaning.
I hope the following line-by-line comments will clarify these general points.
15
Line 26: ‘eusociality’ here lumps societies and superorganisms, which Boomsma & Gawne show
are fundamentally different social systems, going back to Darwin, Weismann, Wheeler, Fisher,
Williams and others all the way through the 1960s, until sociobiology started to water down and
muddle these definitions. The Boomsma reviews (particularly 2013) also make this point,
emphasizing that Crespi & Yanega (1995) and Beekman et al (2006) also criticized the ‘eusociality
continuum’ ideas emanating from the watered down definitions by E.O. Wilson in the 1970s.
Line 29: Refs 9+10+12 had their modelling assumptions wrong for the monogamy hypothesis as
originally formulated by Boomsma, which ref. 12 partly rectifies and the recent Davies&Gardner
paper makes more explicit. You also admit that later on, but without stating the explicit reasons.
There is also a semantic issue here. Empirical data can never be ‘put to mathematical tests’, not
even in physics. Mathematical models can be used to derive predictions from axiomatic
assumptions that can then be empirically tested, not the other way around. Being precise about
this distinction is crucial particularly in evolutionary biology, where the main function of models
is to make sense of empirically observed variation in social behaviours and life-histories –
anything beyond that is illusionary.
Line 30: The monogamy hypothesis is not about the evolution of cooperation (for mutual
benefits) but about the evolution of obligate reproductive altruism. What Hughes et al. (2008) and
Cornwallis et al. (2010) tested was whether low parental promiscuity favors facultative
reproductive reproductive altruism (with for social insects obligate reproductive altruism as a
putative later extension). They never tested the hypothesis in its most stringent version originally
proposed.
Line 32-33: When you conceptualize the evolution of permanent true worker castes as an
evolutionary point of no return (i.e. a major evolutionary transition), as all Boomsma reviews
since 2007 have done, the later transitions to multiple queen mating and polygyny (the latter
primarily in ants – see Boomsma, Huszár & Pedersen, Animal Behaviour 2014) are not relevant
for the argument, because by then true worker castes could no longer go back to facultative
(condition-dependent) altruism. Also here ‘cooperative behaviour’ is an inaccurate description of
what the monogamy hypothesis is about (same in Line 35).
Line 35-40: Once more, the monogamy hypothesis is not about these cases. If daughters stay to
help even though they could have dispersed, there is no reason to question that they do that
because the inequality specified by Hamilton’s rule compels them to do so. Because these cases
represent facultative altruism, it is expected that measured average direct and indirect fitnesses
are in fact equal (representing a frequency dependent ESS equilibrium where both strategies do
equally well). This is what the cited studies report and it is all consistent with inclusive fitness
theory, even though the papers try to argue otherwise – very little if anything in these decision
making processes can be shown to be maladaptive or challenging established inclusive fitness
theory (line 41-42). But the main issue is that none of this challenges the monogamy hypothesis
for its prediction of major evolutionary transitions to superorganismality as defined by Wheeler
(Boomsma & Gawne, 2018).
Line 44: The above implies there is no dissonance between theory and empirical results as
implied here, provided one phrases the predictions and assumptions of the Boomsma hypothesis
correctly, rather than forcing them into uninformative sociobiology jargon that Boomsma tried to
avoid.
Line 50: Again, the argument is not about cooperation but about reproductive altruism.
Line 56-58: How do you define ‘a species’ sociobiology’? It would seem preferable to me to avoid
16
vague language like this. Once more all of this is about the expression of condition-dependent
facultative altruism with or without simultaneous direct fitness gains (captured by mutualistic
cooperation) – nothing of what is here appears to challenge the monogamy hypothesis for the
evolution of obligate reproductive altruism.
Line 59-63: Also this point seems misplaced as criticism of the monogamy hypothesis, because it
seems to represent a ‘parasocial’ arrangement, which the Boomsma reviews explicitly excluded as
ancestral state for the evolution of superorganismality in the Wheeler sense.
Line 63-67: This makes sense to me, but it is perhaps premature to highlight here based on just a
submitted paper, particularly because all of this seems consistent with the Hamiltonian paradigm
that ecology (the b/c ration in Hamilton’s rule) is as decisive as the relatedness terms when all
three vary at the same time, as is always the case when evaluating cases of condition-dependent
expression of facultative reproductive altruism. All the monogamy hypothesis did was claim that
maximal and invariable relatedness was a necessary condition for making major evolutionary
transitions to obligate reproductive altruism with permanently unmated workers – so for this
kind of transitions relatedness comes first, cancels out of Hamilton’s rule, so that b/c >1 comes to
represent the sufficient condition for actually making such transitions. A recent paper (Smith,
Kent, Boomsma, Stow, Nature Ecology and Evolution 2018) shows that this proof of concept
works fine to explain the evolution of life-time unmated workers in an ambrosia beetle – the
commentary by Nick Davies summarizes that very well.
Line 67-69: I think this point has been made earlier in a Keller and Reeve model – all fine. It just
has no direct bearing on the assumptions and predictions of the Boomsma monogamy
hypothesis.
Line 70: ‘Recently the monogamy debate has extended …’ ?? If you carefully read the Boomsma
reviews all the way back to 2007 you will see that this was the core of the argument right from the
start – even though the language was made more explicit in later reviews. Ref 10 confuses the
evolution of first helpers at the nest with the point of no return to obligate reproductive altruism,
which are very different things. Even though some others have also confused these issues in
previous papers, you cannot hold the logic presented by Boomsma responsible for that confusion.
Line 75-76: No, of course not. But maternal manipulation is only a (partial) alternative
explanation to voluntary reproductive altruism in social systems where some nests retain helpers
and other nests do not. All those dynamics are covered by the classic dynamics of Hamilton’s rule
and have no bearing on the monogamy hypothesis as formulated for the evolution of life-time
unmated nursing castes.
Line 76-87: For all I know, Davies & Gardner showed that the Olejarz et al. model was
unsatisfactory because it worked with caricature single locus variation with extreme phenotypic
effects. Ever since Alan Grafen wrote his well-known phenotypic gambit paper in the 1980s the
field has been clear about complex social traits being largely independent of such single locus
extreme effects. Making models of that kind (as Olejarz, Nonacs, and some others like to do),
therefore has possible bearing on the first (facultative) expression of reproductive altruism, but
not on the evolution of permanently sterile castes, which requires significant rewiring of complex
gene-regulation networks depending on many genes with small effects. That is why social traits
are best considered to have quantitative genetic variation with overall heritabilities that
determine how such traits respond to selection, but without significant single-gene effects. I
would think this should also apply to many cases of the expression of facultative helping when
governed by the type of phenotypic plasticity proposed by Mary Jane West Eberhard. Also here it
is hard to conceptualize how complex behavioural reaction norms are dependent on single locus
variation with extreme phenotypic effects.
17
Line 98-100: I disagree with this blanket statement, because it suggests that all arguments have
equal merits across the board. The Boomsma monogamy hypothesis has met with unambiguous
support for the predictions that it actually made (major transitions to Wheeler
superorganismality and to obligate multicellularity cf. Fisher, Cornwallis & West, Current
Biology 2013). Other models, among them some by Nonacs, have shown that things are more
complex for facultative reproductive altruism. Under the assumptions stated, these models are
likely correct, but they are not at variance with the monogamy hypothesis as original framed.
They shed light on cases of haplodiploid cooperative breeding and complement more general
insights in (usually diploid) cooperative breeding in other arthropods and vertebrates. When
taking that broader perspective, haplodiploidy is actually quite an idiosyncratic issue, because it
implies that unmatedness does not necessarily imply sterility as it does in diploids. I think also
that should be taken into account when evaluating the merits of a loser version of the monogamy
hypothesis that has now been tested and found to be essentially correct in many diploid
cooperative breeders (alpaeid shrimp, cooperatively breeding birds, cooperatively breeding
mammals, etc – see recent Boomsma reviews for references).
Line 104-142: This list is likely to be in need of qualifications as current relevance seems doubtful.
1. Bourke & Franks (1995) argue that maternal manipulation is essentially a Hamiltonian concept,
as was agreed upon by Richard Alexander, so any discussion of the validity of this idea should be
framed in that context. Also manipulating mothers are under selection to maximize their
inclusive fitness, so manipulating provisioning of daughters in their larval stages so they stay
should not give mothers fewer grandchildren than provisioning them optimally so they can
disperse and breed. 2. So far ‘social heterosis’ has never been shown to play a role empirically for
facultative reproductive altruism; it has for obligate altruism in honeybees and leaf-cutting ants
with obligate multiple queen mating. It seems crucial to acknowledge that distinction. 3. I do not
think it is appropriate to capture humans and paper wasps under the same heading – overall
none of these two systems seem relevant for the monogamy hypothesis as originally framed. 4.
This seems misguided because the monogamy hypothesis is about obligate reproductive altruism
(and in fact obligate multicellular soma as well) evolving ‘voluntarily’. That is why maximal
(invariable) relatedness is key because it makes the r-terms cancel out of Hamilton’s rule. That
makes the power issue brought up here moot. The Davies & Gardner model acknowledges that,
any model coming out of Nowak’s group does not. 5. As far as ‘groups’ are parasocial
aggregations, this argument is irrelevant for the monogamy hypothesis which requires colony
founding by a life-time monogamous pair. 6. Also this point seems hardly relevant, because
outbreeding is normally secured in social systems. The few cases in which societies have
offspring hanging around that do not obtain indirect fitness are irrelevant for the monogamy
hypothesis. As Michael Griesser argued (recent PLOS Biology paper) there are forms of family
life that essentially represent extended parental care. They will imply interesting social dynamics,
but there is no relevance to the monogamy hypothesis when offspring do not help to obtain
indirect fitness benefits. 7+8. Also these topics do not seem relevant for the monogamy
hypothesis. They are of interest, but have been of interest ever since inclusive fitness theory was
proposed so are hardly novel; antagonistic interlocus genetics remains poorly understood even in
sexual selection research – it seems hardly relevant as a pressing research agenda here.
In sum, the title of the paper is too broad for the issues the paper actually evaluates. The
monogamy hypothesis was never about cooperation for mutual direct fitness benefits, but only
about the evolution of obligate reproductive altruism. Suggesting it was more by using
‘cooperation’ muddles the water. Many of these 1-8 topics are of interest, but just not in the
context at hand.
Line 145-149: All valuable scientific theory is dogmatic. How else would Einstein and Bohr have
succeeded replacing Newton mechanics? G.C. Williams explicitly emphasized the need for
18
biological theory to also be stringent, so its predictions are vulnerable to falsification – that is why
he explicitly endorsed inclusive fitness theory in his 1966 book Adaptation and Natural Selection.
Neither I nor any others who have developed or tested the monogamy hypothesis have ever
claimed it will be relevant for any social system. However, the framing has been increasingly
precise about what is predicted and what is not (see particularly Boomsma reviews from 2013,
2014 and 2018), and these exclude scenarios involving the expression of facultative reproductive
altruism with less than maximal sibling relatedness or cooperation for mutual direct benefits.
Line 149-153: As far as I am aware we know of no examples where ‘emergent group level
benefits’ have been shown to challenge inclusive fitness theory. In general, any invocation of
‘emergence’ is unhelpful for scientific progress. As J.B.S. Haldane wrote: ‘Particularly hostile to
true scientific progress are the
extremer forms of emergence ….. [S]cience is committed to the attempt to unify human
experience by explaining the complex in terms of the simple - The Causes of Evolution (1932). I
think Peter Nonacs adheres to this principle when he closes off writing “Trust in inclusive fitness,
but verify”. However, it would then help for maintaining transparency in the literature if he
would refrain from sociobiology terminology that was never intended to accurately capture the
assumptions and predictions of inclusive fitness theory, and from using strawman versions of
extensions of inclusive fitness theory to line up arguments that do not address real issues.

label_comment_3
As before, I am limiting myself to commenting upon issues of factual correctness, especially
regarding Davies and Gardner (2018), rather than issues of interpretation or opinion. That's not to
say that I think natural history is a matter of opinion. As the author states, people might disagree
on how to define eusociality or any other word, but I don't agree that this is merely a
"philosophical" issue because some definitions increase our understanding and others don't.
Because I'm an author of the piece that is being commented upon, I think this is the appropriate
role to take here and although I don't agree with everything being said here, my feeling is that
that debate is better held in the open.
Lines 26-29. I think the relatedness term in Hamilton's rule is incorrectly defined here, because it
seems like c is the number of foregone offspring for the actor, and b is the number of additional
offspring for the recipient, so then r should be the relatedness between the actor and the recipient,
not the relatedness between the actor and the recipient's offspring. (Or alternatively, c needs to be
multiplied by the relatedness to the actor's offspring.)
Line 40. This is just a comment. In my view, there are two (related) reasons why the cited models
don't conform with Hamilton's rule (rb > c). One is that some of the studies assume that altruistic
phenotypes are encoded by alleles of large effect. I hope it is becoming increasingly clear to
theorists and practitioners that predictions made from models that assume quantitative genetics
or which make equivalent assumptions such as additivity of allelic effects (as Hamilton did in
deriving rb > c; also see previous comment on quantitative genetics from reviewer 2) cannot
simply be transposed into a model that assumes alleles of large effect. A lot of the disagreement
over inclusive fitness really boils down to this issue. My own view is that the quantitative view is
the more general one, since it is equivalent to the assumption that mutations of intermediate
effect will eventually arise in a population. It also has empirical support for the reasons
mentioned by reviewer 2. Finally, in cases where the predictions made by quantitative genetics
and the predictions made by biallelic models diverge the most, that is precisely when there will
be the strongest selection for an allele of intermediate effect to spread. So I really think there is
good reason to believe that, over evolutionary time, populations will tend to conform to
predictions made by quantitative-genetic models rather than models with alleles of fixed effect.
The second reason is that Hamilton's rule—in the strict sense of rb > c—is designed to analyse a
specific social phenotype, in which an actor gives up some of their reproductive fitness in order
to increase the reproductive fitness of a relative and there are *no other impacts to their actions*.
One can't take rb > c and apply it unthinkingly when there are other things going on, like male
production by workers, nest inheritance, and so on. The way that Gardner, myself and others
apply inclusive fitness theory is by first building a model which (hopefully) captures the relevant
phenomenon, then interpreting the results in terms of inclusive fitness, not by starting with rb > c
and trying to fit it to every social evolutionary problem that involves altruism. For example,
Davies and Gardner (2018) don't end up with rb > c, but a more complex condition.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
I appreciate the efforts by the author to clarify a number of points that I raised in my first review,
which has given a better balance overall. However, my comments below will emphasize that
further revision would be desirable if this paper is to serve the authors’ purpose of pointing
towards a way forward.
General comments:
- It remains puzzling to me that the author seems to think he can discuss the merits of monogamy
as a key explanatory variable without precisely referring to where the idea comes from and how
it developed. Before Boomsma (2007) the concept simply did not exist, except as a few
throwaway sentences by Hamilton, Dawkins and Cronin (the introduction of that first review has
the citations). If you choose a title like the one you have now, and aim to make a contribution that
could ease a perceived controversy, you will have to relate to the concept as it was developed
between 2007 and 2018 and at least briefly mention the consistent empirical evidence for it. This
mentioning should differentiate between the strict monogamy (window) hypothesis for major
transitions to permanent castes, and monogamy as reduced promiscuity serving as statistical
predictor of the expression of context-dependent (facultative) altruism. These two aspects are
really different issues and not acknowledging that difference muddles the water.
- If you did (re)read the full spectrum of monogamy reviews, you would notice that monogamy
was ONLY claimed to have been a universal necessary condition (and NOT a sufficient
condition) for the evolution of life-time unmated castes. It has also been made clear from the start
(and in increasingly precise language in later reviews) that in all societies of cooperative breeders
(e.g. halictids, Polistes, lower termites, naked mole rats, snapping shrimp, meerkats, family living
birds) the three parameters of Hamilton’s rule always vary simultaneously (even when
relatedness is high). This implies that the monogamy hypothesis had nothing fundamentally new
to say about those social systems were multiple (often most) co-breeding individuals have
independent agency (totipotency) – the hypothesis only claimed to parsimoniously explain the
21
handful of convergent major transitions to obligate eusociality (Wheeler superorganismality;
Boomsma & Gawne, 2018) where that independent agency has irreversibly disappeared. If you
write (line 19) that ‘No single topic better exemplifies the ongoing controversy than the question
of what role does monogamy play in the evolution of reproductive division of labor within
cooperating family associations’, you just have to be explicit that you address monogamy as it
applies to societies of cooperative breeders, not the strict major transitions monogamy-window
hypothesis.
- With this in mind, I remain unsure whether I understand your title ‘Hamilton’s rule is essential
but insufficient for understanding monogamy’s role in social evolution’. I think we agree on the
first part, but I do not understand the ending. The strict monogamy-window hypothesis is just a
reduction of Hamilton’s rule (the r terms cancel) and if monogamy is not 100% the standard
version of Hamilton’s rule continues to capture everything as a first-principle theory. So what is
insufficient in your title supposed to mean? We know that inclusive fitness is the sum of direct
fitness and indirect fitness, so do you mean that direct fitness benefits are often essential as long
as altruism remains facultative? But that is true by definition according to Hamilton’s rule. Even
if mothers would manipulate daughters against their interests (for which the evidence is weak),
parental manipulation does not represent something alien to inclusive fitness theory. Bourke and
Franks (1995) have some pages of text explaining this. If this essay is to meant to objectively map
out what we (dis)agree on and what is perhaps subject to debate, I think you should make clear
that the monogamy (window) hypothesis predicted how major transitions to permanent castes
have come about and then add that this may have confused readers to believe monogamy was an
essential condition for all forms of social evolution. You could then proceed outlining why this is
not the case and how/why Hamiltonian logic allows a variety of social traits to be maintained
either for reasons of cooperation (no relatedness involved) or by facultative expression of
altruism, or (perhaps) by offspring being manipulated into maximizing their mother’s fitness.
Anything else will be perceived as a broadside against the monogamy hypothesis as a whole that
lacks the necessary nuance and will thus not achieve the balance you appear to aim for.
- Pitting the monogamy idea against NTW (2010), a paper that failed to make even a single
testable prediction and that kept all its assumptions implicit, seems a tall order when the goal is
to remain balanced. Modelling in ecology and evolution is ultimately about explaining variation
in social systems of very different kinds from the same parsimonious set of first principles.
Precise definitions are part of the transparent overall approach needed to achieve that – not
merely a philosophical ‘human imposed’ issue. Evolutionary biology cannot be a serious science
if one focuses on ‘process’ without having precise language to capture process, as the author
argues in one of his responses. This contrast is particularly strange because NTW only modelled
full sib colonies, so they implicitly worked with strict monogamy as your ref 15 pointed out. I still
believe you do your mission a disservice by starting to argue from NTW (2010) in implicitly
supportive language, because these authors were never interested in a proper discussion whereas
you are.
- Assumptions of models do matter crucially (as the author highlights in line 63), but this
arguments deserves to be generalized. In evolutionary biology models should both make their
assumptions and predictions explicit, which is rarely consistently done for phenotypes in
population genetic models. Furthermore, both assumptions and predictions should be testable.
One cannot expect that tests of the predictions have been done when a model is novel, but
scientific transparency requires that modellers tell their readers how their assumptions apply to
specific groups of organisms and provide reasonable evidence that they are likely to be valid in a
sufficient number of cases to make the model worth the trouble. The NTW paper is a case in point
where essentially all crucial assumptions remained implicit and sometimes turned out
nonsensical when digging them out (e.g. the idea that workers do not need to be considered as
evolutionary agents). Another, already mentioned, implicit assumption in that paper was that
22
they in fact only considered full sib families where relatedness was constant and non-variable. I
find it hard to imagine that you endorse of practices like this and believe you have sufficient
experience as a field naturalist to agree that matching model assumptions with empirical
evidence is a point of key importance.
- The disagreement issue that you address in this essay is real, but not a discussion between
parties holding equally strong decks of cards - less than a handful empirically inclined biologists
have seen any merit in NTW (2010), about 30 times fewer than the ones who signed the 2011
rebuttals. This is why I think you do your mission a disservice by focusing on that particular
paper in the approving sense that your wording suggests. The issue is really about types of
models to be used and the assumptions that feed them. I think the author and I agree that the
significance of inclusive fitness theory has been immense. What we also should agree upon is the
‘make assumptions explicit’ issue summarized above. What (only in part) separates us is that he
appears to feel that specific population genetic models have the potential to overturn general
first-principle theory such as Hamilton’s rule, where I feel they will only complement first
principle theory. But at least here we have an issue that may well not be obvious to many
biologists, so is worth clarifying because it never appears authors like Nowak, Van Veelen, Allen
and E.O. Wilson have an interest in engaging in this discussion. My overall impression is that it
always turns out that when Nowak’s group produces an explicitly genetic model, it is just a
matter of time until someone else (e.g. Nick Davies and Andy Gardner is the most recent case)
shows those ‘overturning conclusions’ are simply a consequence of making rather extreme
assumptions about how genes affect phenotypes. But that type of discussion is not new –
Hamilton and later Dave Queller, Steve Frank, Stu West, Andy Gardner, James Marshall, Peter
Taylor, Francois Rousset, etc have all made it clear that strong selection, drift, dominance, non-
additivity, etc will make Hamilton’s rule only approximately valid or sometimes make it fail. To
see why, one should realize that as soon as one goes down the path of more specific ‘realistic’
models the extra assumptions needed (relative to the Price-equation inclusive fitness approach)
make such models less general. As Dave Queller writes in the Introduction of his 2017 AmNat
paper: ‘Levins (1966) discussed how models have to trade off between generality, realism and
precision. Kuhn (1977) similarly noted that theories face conflicts between accuracy, consistency,
scope, simplicity’, and fruitfulness. It is my clear impression that the author agrees with this but it
remains very implicit.
- The non-novelty of the NTW critique on the Price equation approach has been aptly described
by Steve Frank, a mathematical scholar on par with Nowak. If the author would care to check his
series of seven papers in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology (2011-2013), he would find all the
references to these early insights. Particularly Frank (2012) Natural selection. IV. The Price
equation (JEB 25, 1002-1019) is illuminating, because the final sections address the so called
‘controversy’. I quote: ‘This quote from van Veelen et al. (2012) demonstrates an interesting
approach to scholarship. They first cite Frank as stating that dynamic insufficiency is a drawback
of the Price equation. They then disagree with that point of view and present as their own
interpretation an argument that is nearly identical in concept and phrasing to my own statement
in the very paper that they cited as the foundation for their disagreement.’ Given this kind of
arguing, does it then surprise the author of the present essay that little appreciation for the
approach of NTW (2010) has accumulated? Another quote that the author may find interesting is
from Frank’s final paper in this series entitled Natural selection. VII. History and interpretation of
kin selection theory (JEB 26, 1151-1184, 2013) which says: ‘Nowak et al. (2010) say that one must
make a specific model for a specific case, and then one gets the right answer. True, but the history
of science shows unambiguously that one gains a lot by understanding the abstract causal
principles that join different cases and different models within a common framework (Frank,
2012b).’ The upshot is, as Hamilton already knew, that explicit population genetic models are
important, but they are (by definition) never general and generate few testable predictions.
23
- In light of the above, I retain my opinion that, for this essay to be influential, you need to make
explicit that the role of monogamy as a predictor is crucially different in social domains where
altruism is facultative (i.e. cooperative breeders) and domains where altruism is obligate (all
helpers remain unmated; hence they are true workers - what Darwin meant with ‘neuters’).
Boomsma & Gawne (2018) have the most recent and complete update of that logic. Making this
distinction is important because it seems futile you challenge the evidence for the major
evolutionary transition logic of the monogamy hypothesis given the consistent evidence (the
Smith et al. paper on Austroplatypus ambrosia beetles in Nature E&E (2018) gives a
complementary summary of what Boomsma & Gawne reviewed). You can then focus on the
cooperative breeders where becoming a helper remains facultative, so that either social nests
coexist with solitary nests (e.g. Megalopta) or where reproductive success always requires
colonial sociality but where relatedness is never high enough to create a ‘monogamy window’
(e.g. Polistes, naked mole rats, Seychelles warblers, meerkats). Focusing on that type of social
systems is useful because your summary will then make clear that: 1. Monogamy may help, but
not necessarily does help (e.g. Magalopta if maternal manipulation is real; greater anis because
they do not live in family groups so indirect fitness is moot). 2. You will be able to clarify the
misunderstanding that all social systems required a monogamy window – although never
intended by Boomsma, this is how some people have misunderstood the phylogenies in Hughes
et al. (2008). 3. That approach will put your own models in their right context for example when
making clear that monogamy is not necessarily good if there is nest inheritance. 4. It will also
allow connections with reproductive skew logic, which is about cooperative breeders that co-
breed in spite of being totipotent (skew theory is not about permanent castes and obligate
division of labor). 5. You might briefly refer to a discussion between Charlie Cornwallis & co,
Dustin Rubinstein & co, and Michael Griesser & co on what drives cooperative breeding in birds.
You will notice that what seemed a fundamental disagreement (relatedness first versus ecology
first) now appears to be evaporating because Michael Griesser talks about extended parental care
(no indirect fitness as in greater anis), and Cornwallis and Rubinstein recently published a joint
paper agreeing on (as a broad trend) monogamy (low promiscuity) having promoted the
colonization of harsh environments, but that living and radiating in harsh environments induced
secondary reversals to promiscuity, some of that related to ‘family life’ giving way to groups of
non-relatives. 6. In fact, all the six points towards the end of your paper are about cooperative
breeding (none is about obligate worker castes) so all you need to do is make that explicit. 7. It
would get you away from unfruitful discussions on whether inclusive fitness logic explains
everything. Maternal manipulation or not, the key point is that helpers always obtain non-trivial
indirect fitness benefits when they invest in helping (as they do in your refs 17-20), which is all
that matters when altruism is expressed in a facultative (context dependent) manner. It would
seem to me that an emphasis in this direction would make your essay much more valuable
because you could show that: 1. There is no fundamental disagreement between almost
everybody that different types of models serve complementary purposes. 2. That different types
of models only do that when previous insights are respected (provided they were thoroughly
documented – NTW did not show that respect), and 3. That monogamy in the sense of low
promiscuity is a statistical facilitator for cooperative breeding, not a necessary condition as it
apparently was for evolving obligate ‘neuter’ castes or, as termite researchers would say, for
evolving ‘true workers’.
- I find much of this so called ‘controversy’ frustrating, because I do not feel responsible for it
although I am happy to take credit for the monogamy hypothesis. If the author would care to re-
read the closing paragraph of Boomsma (2009) I hope he can see why. I would now not have
phrased this closing statement in sociobiology ‘eusociality language’, but by contrasting Wheeler-
superorganismality (obligate unmated altruism) against cooperative breeding (among totipotent
reproductive agents expressing at best facultative altruism) as done in later reviews. However,
the meaning remains the same. The cooperative breeder domain of social evolution is more
24
taxonomically diverse, more dynamic, and more variable in causation. Both models and
empirical evidence show that and it is by acknowledging that distinction that a more transparent
version of your essay can make a positive difference.
Specific points:
Line 16. ‘arguably intensified’ - I think this phrasing needs adjustment. To my knowledge no
new authors have joined the small group of inclusive fitness theory critics. So we would need
citations here proving that statement.
Line 17. ‘aggressively vociferous’ - This kind of language should be avoided. Overall, it would be
sufficient if lines 15-17 merely stated that no consensus has been reached. Who started making
this debate acrimonious is open to interpretation. As I explained above, most opinionated
evolutionary biologists considered NTW (2010) to be an unduly aggressive and poorly argued
attempt to discredit the most successful general theory of adaptation produced in the 20th
century.
Line 33. To keep the discussion general, I think this should say ‘as from multiple mating or
cooperative breeding of multiple females’
Line 39. ‘touted’ is unnecessary pejorative. Another case where language moderation is in order.
The statement also seems to be formally incorrect. The ‘monogamy window’ is a theoretical
concept (Boomsma, 2007, 2009, 3013) that has only been claimed to be a necessary condition for
major transitions to coloniality with permanent castes (see general comments above).
Line 42. ‘above phylogenies’? – you mean phylogenetically controlled comparative analyses?
Line 45. ‘for unexplained reasons’?? It has been known for many years (Boomsma & Ratnieks,
1996; Strassmann, 2001) that obligate multiple queen mating in ants and corbiculate bees is a
secondary derived evolutionary development, later confirmed to also apply to the vespine wasps
by the studies of Foster and Ratnieks, all well before Hughes et al. (2008). The monogamy
hypothesis provides a simple parsimonious general explanation for these convergent phenomena
by stipulating that once the point of no return to irreversibly unmated worker castes had been
passed, these secondary developments were free to evolve when they provided lasting benefits. If
workers no longer have the plasticity to opt out by mating and dispersing, then one should not
expect any group disharmony to arise except as a secondary consequence of chimeric colonies
(requiring for example worker policing as documented most thoroughly in the honey bee). This
point has been made in a single discussion sentence by Hamilton (1964), somewhat more
elaborately by Boomsma & Ratnieks (1996), and explicitly in all the monogamy review published
since 2007. That not all later empirical papers have been precise on this point cannot he held
against the hypothesis having been transparent. It is actually at this level that the authors
‘heterosis’ hypothesis works.
Line 47-55. Terms like ‘cast doubt’ and ‘very maladaptive’ are inconsistent with the evidence and
would thus best be phrased more carefully. This section claims there is repeated evidence for
worker behaviour that does not make sense from an inclusive fitness perspective. I have checked
all four studies and cannot see how they provide strong evidence for the inference that
Hamiltonian logic is problematic. Nonacs er al. (2006) tested reproductive skew models that the
author later dismissed as having limited general value (Nonacs & Hager, 2011; Biological
Reviews). Skew models are derived from inclusive fitness logic but failed to live up to
expectations because they needed too many special assumptions that could hardly be tested. It is
thus no great surprise that the qualitative cross-taxa predictions in the 2006 study appeared to
work, but the detailed population-level predictions did not. The second study (Rehan et al., 2014)
25
is about a bee where two sisters may build joint nests and where indirect fitness of subordinates
was only half the direct fitness of nesting alone. However, that study did not measure the
mortality costs of dispersing and initiating a nest alone. If that cost would be twice the failure rate
of staying as a helper, the two options would be equivalent and consistent with Hamilton’s rule
(as a mixed ESS not unlike the birds in your ref 14). The Gadagkar (2016) paper is essentially a
review of decades of work and ends with the conclusion: ‘Clearly, Hamilton’s rule provides a
powerful framework for understanding the evolution of social and altruistic behaviour in R.
marginata. Even though I have often complained that most investigators focus excessively or
exclusively on r and neglect the b and c terms in Hamilton’s rule, the power of the theory is
evident when all three factors are considered, as I have attempted to do for R. marginata.’
Kapheim et al. (2015) is the best and most recent single case study, but also here authors had to
infer what direct fitness helpers could have had in a rather indirect way. This allowed them to
quantify productivity alternatives, but they could not consider the possibility that dispersal
rather than helping would likely incur significantly higher mortality costs. In sum, none of these
studies refute inclusive fitness logic because helpers obtained measurable inclusive fitness
benefits in all cases. Such qualitative confirmations are often the best that can be achieved,
because quantifying the Hamiltonian b and c variables remains essentially impossible in natural
settings where dispersal costs are almost impossible to obtain. I suggest the author adjusts the
phrasing of this paragraph to do justice to what was really shown. As far as I can see not all
authors of these four papers have invoked maternal manipulation and Kapheim et al. only
inferred that mechanism was consistent with the data. It has not been proven.
Line 56. Having reached this point it is really hard to see the ‘dissonance’. In all cases where tests
were done (your refs 13, 14, 17-20) non-trivial indirect fitness benefits were always found,
consistent with Hamiltonian logic. If there were quantitative mismatches (the indirect fitness
benefits seeming not to be substantial enough), the most parsimonious explanation was that the
non-measured costs of dispersal were substantial.
Line 68-70. Yes of course, but this is the key argument of the monogamy window hypothesis for
the emergence of life-time unmated castes. Under strict monogamy the r-terms cancel out of
Hamilton’s rule, so all that matters is the b>c condition – i.e. what you call life-history and
ecology. Before lineages reach that point of no-return what matters if br>c. This may seem a
subtle difference, but it is not, because many combinations of b and r can make the inequality
work. You just need substantial benefits applying in particular nest settings (and not in others) to
express conditional altruism even when relatedness is modest. But altruism will never become
obligate in such scenarios. That apparently only happened when relatedness to siblings remained
identical to relatedness to offspring over a huge number of generations, i.e. a sufficient number to
irreversibly rewire complete developmental pathways (with hideously complex gene regulation
networks) to produce permanent queen and worker castes. The assumption of a worker taking
over the nest from her dead mother has never been part of the predictive domain of the
monogamy window hypothesis. It is clearly a derived trait in lineages where permanent castes
evolved, and as far as nest inheritance happens in societies with facultative altruism it may well
prevent they can reach the monogamy window needed to evolve permanent castes. I believe that
is consistent with your models, but phrasing this precisely matters for transparency of argument.
Line 75-76. The point here is whether maternal manipulation can induce irreversible transitions to
life-time true-worker castes. There is no evidence to my knowledge that this has been modelled
or observed to happen. Also the halictid systems considered in the Quinones & Pen model
ultimately have to converge on strict monogamy before true helper traits can go to fixation (i.e.
show the first signs of becoming irreversible).
Line 78. ‘also considered’? unclear phrasing. You mean ‘considered a scenario’?
26
Line 82-87. I think this summary of the Davies and Gardner paper is understating the clarity of
their results to a degree that does not serve the balanced view the author says he pursues. The
first sentence will never communicate to the unprepared reader that their analyses showed that
none of the conclusions of the Olejarz model really held up when realistic population genetics
were used. The second sentence is totally non-transparent and can easily be read as the Davies
and Gardner paper having unresolved loose ends, which I do not think was the case within the
framework they considered. I also remember the Davies and Gardner paper showing the
argument of worker sons not to hold up in their analyses, so more clear language (and references)
would be needed if you disagree.
Line 89. Once more – the original monogamy hypothesis was primarily about the evolution of
life-time unmated castes in the ants, bees, wasps and termites. Only after making that first-
principle inference did Boomsma (2007) suggest that similar tendencies might be occurring in
cooperative breeders, i.e. make the expression of facultative altruism more likely. It was that
latter part that was tested and found to be correct in cooperatively breeding birds and mammals
(Cornwallis; Lukas). Your phrasing is so general that this key point is glossed over, which
muddles the water. In cooperative breeders monogamy is a statistical predictor; for the evolution
of true workers it becomes a necessary condition. These are very different things (see general
comments above).
Line 90-91. ‘enhance, retard, or have no effect …’ as ‘overall conclusion’. Of what, of models that
did not make their assumptions explicit? I am not aware of any empirical data set that has shown
that the monogamy hypothesis was incorrect if you consider (as you should) that it never
intended to replace Hamilton’s rule in vertebrate cooperative breeders and social insects where
altruism is facultative (condition dependent).
Line 92-95. This is true, but it seems to be just restating Hamilton’s rule. No monogamy paper
every claimed to replace that logic.
Line 96-105. My compliments for the constructive language in this paragraph. This is what the
tone should be throughout this essay. You might want to add some of the 2010-2011 papers by
Van Veelen as good examples of acrimonious inclusive fitness critique.
Line 106-113. It is unclear to me why the tone of this paragraph then becomes unbalanced again. I
think ‘prosecutorial’ is once more a type of language to be avoided. All these papers did was
reason from first GENERAL principles against a paper that was broadly conceived as a very
unreasonable attack on massive progress in general understanding of social evolution based on
inclusive fitness theory (see my general intro comments). It was NTW who started ignoring all
the evidence (which you acknowledge in the previous paragraph). Objections were not
‘disingenuous’ (again wording that should be removed). All we can say is that there is
disagreement about whether single-locus modelling with strong discontinuous effects on
assumed phenotypes is useful or not (see my general comment above). Whether the mathematics
was correct is besides the point. The equations were correct in all papers as far as I know, else
criticism would have been much stronger. The point is that when assumptions are wrong, the
outcome will make no sense. In such cases results are not inconvenient (another value laden term
to be reconsidered), but irrelevant for what happens in natural populations. Please rephrase this
paragraph to achieve balanced coverage as you do in the preceding paragraph.
Line 112. ‘… exceptions accumulate’ I am not aware of such accumulation. Do you mean the same
four papers addressed above (refs 17-20)? You would have to give new references to justify
‘accumulate’.
27
Line 113. ‘uncritical’? To my knowledge almost every test of inclusive fitness theory has been an
independent challenge of the general applicability of first-principle inclusive fitness theory.
Critical attitudes in the Popperian sense have thus abounded and the theory has survived these
refutation assaults at least in a qualitative sense. You may find that having more quantitative
matches would be desirable, and I would agree. However, even the qualitative matches have
been inspiring enough to generate new avenues of derived inclusive fitness theory, as for
example David Haig’s genomic imprinting theory. By the way, also Dave Queller and Steve
Frank have always argued that both types of models are useful and complementary.
Line 114. Remove the value-laden word like ‘presciently’
Line. 118-121. NTW did not pioneer simulation modelling and simulation modelling is something
else than formal mathematical modelling. Formal mathematics provides first principle theory
such as Hamilton’s rule and its broadened version using the Price equation. Simulation models
address specific cases where multiple restrictive assumptions need to be made, and where
complexity exceeds what can be tracked analytically. As I tried to explain in my general
comments above, simulation approaches can be useful but only if the assumptions about what
phenotypes do are reasonable, and they should never claim to demonstrate something truly
general. Overselling in that way was typical for the NTW paper and because their assumptions
were often wrong or irrelevant, it gained no followers. I do not understand why the author is so
adamant to defend this paper as some kind of a ‘flagship case’. It detracts from the merits of his
own models, which are more realistic and where he is willing to be specific about assumptions
and about matches with general theory.
Line 124-125. ‘could consider’. Yes, but again the power issue is fundamentally different for
lineages where colonies have facultative altruism versus those that have obligate altruism. You
should make explicit that your point is about the former, not the latter type of social systems, and
cite the well-known review by Beekman and Ratnieks to build any new argument on that
synthesis. In fact it turns out that not only this first point, but also the following points 2-6 are
about social systems with facultative altruism (see my last general comment above).
Line 136. ‘can easily select’ …. As far as I am aware there is no evidence for this to be ‘easy’ and to
my knowledge there are no empirical data showing that selection for genetic diversity has
produced consistent group adaptations in cooperative breeders. Reference 41 reports patterns
across empirical studies but without addressing whether drifting ‘workers’ are potential
reproducers or not. The only exceptions of unambiguous group adaptations owing to higher
(chimeric) genetic diversity within groups appear to have happened after the point of no return
to superorganismality had been passed. I.e., honeybee and leaf-cutting ant colonies deal better
with disease when they have more patrilines and costly obligate multiple queen mating is
therefore a functional adaptation. Whether drifting workers can be considered to be a group
adaptation remains to be proven and seems unlikely from a general theoretical perspective –
these phenomena are merely effects of something else that could easily not have a functional
adaptive significance (see Williams, 1966, for an important discussion about function and effect).
Referring to ‘indirect reciprocity’ is unhelpful if you do not add a few lines of explanation of how
that concept connects to what this essay is about.
Line 140-141. The monogamy hypothesis has always emphasized life-time (obligate)
unmatedness, not obligate sterility, which requires diploidy to be an automatic consequence of
unmatedness.
Line 144-146. This is a hand-waving statement. The monogamy hypothesis predicts (both in the
early reviews and more explicitly in the later ones, which you should cite if you aim to be
28
balanced) that such reversals should not have happened. That prediction has been consistent with
all available evidence so far (see Boomsma & Gawne 2018 and Smith et al. 2018 for updates), so a
statement like this is misleading unless you can cite empirical papers that have provided
evidence to the contrary. A more productive approach would be to make sure you acknowledge
that the ‘monogamy window’ hypothesis for major transitions to caste societies is something else
than facilitating monogamy in cooperative breeders (see my general comments) – and focus on
the latter.
Line 147. The monogamy (window) hypothesis is about how facultative altruism can be replaced
by obligate altruism, not about cooperation.
Line 148-150. Yes, it should work both ways, but only if relatedness is a true variable as in
cooperatively breeding vertebrates, Polistes wasps, halictid bees etc. Once more, the core idea of
the monogamy hypothesis is that strict full-sibling relatedness makes the relatedness terms
cancel. That was apparently a necessary condition for major irreversible transitions to higher
organismal complexity (both colonial superorganismality and obligate multicellular
organismality), but not a sufficient one (the Leggett et al. paper – your ref 7 – also makes this
point). Only long-term consistent b>c benefits will forge major irreversible transitions after the
necessary condition is fulfilled and that is a tall order. This entire point 3 is fine if you make
explicit it is about cooperative breeders only (just like the other 5 points). In such ‘societies’
monogamy is never strict. References 4 and 8 are perfectly up front about that. Reference 3 was
not, but you cannot hold that against the monogamy hypothesis. It is easy to plot the major
irreversible transitions on the Hughes et al (2008) phylogeny (the base of the corbiculate bees, the
base of the higher termites, the base of the vespine wasps). What you say here applies basal to
those transitions, not beyond them – the later monogamy reviews have been very explicit about
that, but that logic is also in the 2007 and 2009 versions. Irreversibility of transitions to coloniality
where all individuals belong to a complementary caste for life (Wheeler superorganismality) is
not just an assumption, it is consistent with all comparative data both for superorganismality and
obligate multicellularity (cf Smith et al. Nature E&E 2018, Fisher et al. Current Biology 2013,
Boomsma & Gawne, 2018).
Line 151-156. Yes, Polistes colonies and human groups are societies, albeit very different ones
because we have cumulative culture driving our social evolution. So again this is a ‘society’
argument, but it has no bearing on the strict type of monogamy window hypothesized to
represent a necessary condition for the emergence of obligate altruism in superorganisms (which
no longer are societies of totipotent individuals). Once more, it would be useful if you somehow
made these distinctions explicit when you intend this essay to be a way forward.
Line 158. ‘sometimes’? Sibling competition within groups is generally and principally important
as Hamilton and May (1977), Steve Frank (JEB 2012), Stu West & Ido Pen, and Leggett et al. (your
ref 7) have amply documented. The group benefits you have in mind here are just the
Hamiltonian b>c values. Also your point 5 is about family groups before permanent castes
evolve.
Line 162. And so is point 6. The Riehl work is very interesting, but not as a challenge of the
monogamy hypothesis for altruism driven by indirect fitness benefits, because two key
conditions do not apply: 1. ‘helpers’ gain no inclusive fitness – they just hang around to receive
prolonged parental investment. 2. These greater anis are not family groups where altruism could
have evolved.
Line 168-172. The final quote is nice, but should in my opinion refer to the need to test both the
assumptions and the predictions of any model used to better understand social evolution. It has
no specific bearing on ecology and group-level benefits, which are fully covered by Hamilton’s
29
rule as the series of Steve Frank papers in JEB (2011-2013) amply document. Does it have bearings
on genetics? Yes, quite possibly so, but remember Hamilton’s rule is about genetics as well. If you
want to make the genetics more explicit that can be useful, but it will always imply making
restrictive assumptions that the Price equation (general inclusive fitness) approach does not need
to make. If you keep adding special assumptions in order to gain ‘realism’, you may end up with
a model that is very precise about a scenario that may never apply in nature. See my general
comments and the Queller quote given above on how generality and precision of models trade-
off. Both approaches are valuable when assumptions about individual and colony phenotypes are
reasonable – and then they are complementary ways towards understanding. Models with
inappropriate or unspecified assumptions are not useful. I think that should be a major condition
for making your ‘verify’ by modelling credible, but the final arbiter of course remains what the
empirical data show.

Comments to the Author:
Dear Dr. Nonacs,
Thank you for your revised manuscript. I have received evaluations from the two reviewers who
kindly agreed to review your manuscript a second time. Both have signed their reviews. Your
paper continues to stir strong opinions and disagreement but I think you continue to raise an
interesting perspective that deserves a place in the record that will be open to and inspire
continued debate.
Because the motivation to write your paper was based on a response to his paper that is now
published in RSOS, Reviewer 1 (Dr. Davies) has limited his comments to identifying typos and
evaluating the facts presented. He has admirably provided you room for you to argue your
interpretations of them even where he disagrees. The few remaining comments he provides
should be easily addressed or adjusted.
Reviewer 2 (Dr. Boomsma) has provided a thoughtful critique of your revision. I was pleased to
see that he felt that your revision was much improved. Based on my reading of this review, I
believe the focus of his current critique falls to the following: Elements of your manuscript
require more explicit definitions for terms that you discuss, and more precision in your handling
of the domains of social evolution that you are considering. He was puzzled by the structure of
your essay and felt you might re-structure it to do yourself and your position a greater service. I
think you should carefully consider this constructive feedback and that you can evaluate how to
best structure your essay. Although you should not weaken your views when there is good
support for them, the reviewer has identified a few places where potentially unnecessarily
polarizing language could be toned down to make your paper more accessible to others where
appropriate.
I think that you should consider this round of comments and adjust your manuscript where
appropriate, and defend your position in other cases. I strongly commend you for attempting to
shine light on a topic that merits attention, despite the potentially strong feelings of disagreement
on the topic. I commend the reviewers for serving as fact checkers while also allowing you to
argue a different perspective. It is my personal opinion that this is ultimately the best of what
science represents: a forum for active and impassioned disagreement in pursuit of accuracy,
truth, and new discovery. Doing so with grace and cordiality is a criterion that we should all hold
32
ourselves to, and I think you and the reviewers are doing a good job of living up to that mark.
Thank you all. I look forward to receiving what I hope will be a final round of edits from you
soon.
Best

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
As before, I am limiting myself to commenting upon issues of factual correctness, especially
regarding Davies and Gardner (2018), rather than issues of interpretation or opinion. That's not to
say that I think natural history is a matter of opinion. As the author states, people might disagree
on how to define eusociality or any other word, but I don't agree that this is merely a
"philosophical" issue because some definitions increase our understanding and others don't.
Because I'm an author of the piece that is being commented upon, I think this is the appropriate
role to take here and although I don't agree with everything being said here, my feeling is that
that debate is better held in the open.
Lines 26-29. I think the relatedness term in Hamilton's rule is incorrectly defined here, because it
seems like c is the number of foregone offspring for the actor, and b is the number of additional
offspring for the recipient, so then r should be the relatedness between the actor and the recipient,
not the relatedness between the actor and the recipient's offspring. (Or alternatively, c needs to be
multiplied by the relatedness to the actor's offspring.)
Line 40. This is just a comment. In my view, there are two (related) reasons why the cited models
don't conform with Hamilton's rule (rb > c). One is that some of the studies assume that altruistic
phenotypes are encoded by alleles of large effect. I hope it is becoming increasingly clear to
theorists and practitioners that predictions made from models that assume quantitative genetics
or which make equivalent assumptions such as additivity of allelic effects (as Hamilton did in
deriving rb > c; also see previous comment on quantitative genetics from reviewer 2) cannot
simply be transposed into a model that assumes alleles of large effect. A lot of the disagreement
over inclusive fitness really boils down to this issue. My own view is that the quantitative view is
the more general one, since it is equivalent to the assumption that mutations of intermediate
effect will eventually arise in a population. It also has empirical support for the reasons
mentioned by reviewer 2. Finally, in cases where the predictions made by quantitative genetics
and the predictions made by biallelic models diverge the most, that is precisely when there will
be the strongest selection for an allele of intermediate effect to spread. So I really think there is
33
good reason to believe that, over evolutionary time, populations will tend to conform to
predictions made by quantitative-genetic models rather than models with alleles of fixed effect.
The second reason is that Hamilton's rule—in the strict sense of rb > c—is designed to analyse a
specific social phenotype, in which an actor gives up some of their reproductive fitness in order
to increase the reproductive fitness of a relative and there are *no other impacts to their actions*.
One can't take rb > c and apply it unthinkingly when there are other things going on, like male
production by workers, nest inheritance, and so on. The way that Gardner, myself and others
apply inclusive fitness theory is by first building a model which (hopefully) captures the relevant
phenomenon, then interpreting the results in terms of inclusive fitness, not by starting with rb > c
and trying to fit it to every social evolutionary problem that involves altruism. For example,
Davies and Gardner (2018) don't end up with rb > c, but a more complex condition.

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
I appreciate the efforts by the author to clarify a number of points that I raised in my first review,
which has given a better balance overall. However, my comments below will emphasize that
further revision would be desirable if this paper is to serve the authors’ purpose of pointing
towards a way forward.
General comments:
- It remains puzzling to me that the author seems to think he can discuss the merits of
monogamy as a key explanatory variable without precisely referring to where the idea comes
from and how it developed. Before Boomsma (2007) the concept simply did not exist, except as a
few throwaway sentences by Hamilton, Dawkins and Cronin (the introduction of that first review
has the citations). If you choose a title like the one you have now, and aim to make a contribution
that could ease a perceived controversy, you will have to relate to the concept as it was developed
between 2007 and 2018 and at least briefly mention the consistent empirical evidence for it. This
mentioning should differentiate between the strict monogamy (window) hypothesis for major
transitions to permanent castes, and monogamy as reduced promiscuity serving as statistical
predictor of the expression of context-dependent (facultative) altruism. These two aspects are
really different issues and not acknowledging that difference muddles the water.
- If you did (re)read the full spectrum of monogamy reviews, you would notice that
monogamy was ONLY claimed to have been a universal necessary condition (and NOT a
sufficient condition) for the evolution of life-time unmated castes. It has also been made clear
from the start (and in increasingly precise language in later reviews) that in all societies of
cooperative breeders (e.g. halictids, Polistes, lower termites, naked mole rats, snapping shrimp,
meerkats, family living birds) the three parameters of Hamilton’s rule always vary
34
simultaneously (even when relatedness is high). This implies that the monogamy hypothesis had
nothing fundamentally new to say about those social systems were multiple (often most) co-
breeding individuals have independent agency (totipotency) – the hypothesis only claimed to
parsimoniously explain the handful of convergent major transitions to obligate eusociality
(Wheeler superorganismality; Boomsma & Gawne, 2018) where that independent agency has
irreversibly disappeared. If you write (line 19) that ‘No single topic better exemplifies the
ongoing controversy than the question of what role does monogamy play in the evolution of
reproductive division of labor within cooperating family associations’, you just have to be explicit
that you address monogamy as it applies to societies of cooperative breeders, not the strict major
transitions monogamy-window hypothesis.
- With this in mind, I remain unsure whether I understand your title ‘Hamilton’s rule is
essential but insufficient for understanding monogamy’s role in social evolution’. I think we
agree on the first part, but I do not understand the ending. The strict monogamy-window
hypothesis is just a reduction of Hamilton’s rule (the r terms cancel) and if monogamy is not
100% the standard version of Hamilton’s rule continues to capture everything as a first-principle
theory. So what is insufficient in your title supposed to mean? We know that inclusive fitness is
the sum of direct fitness and indirect fitness, so do you mean that direct fitness benefits are often
essential as long as altruism remains facultative? But that is true by definition according to
Hamilton’s rule. Even if mothers would manipulate daughters against their interests (for which
the evidence is weak), parental manipulation does not represent something alien to inclusive
fitness theory. Bourke and Franks (1995) have some pages of text explaining this. If this essay is to
meant to objectively map out what we (dis)agree on and what is perhaps subject to debate, I think
you should make clear that the monogamy (window) hypothesis predicted how major transitions
to permanent castes have come about and then add that this may have confused readers to
believe monogamy was an essential condition for all forms of social evolution. You could then
proceed outlining why this is not the case and how/why Hamiltonian logic allows a variety of
social traits to be maintained either for reasons of cooperation (no relatedness involved) or by
facultative expression of altruism, or (perhaps) by offspring being manipulated into maximizing
their mother’s fitness. Anything else will be perceived as a broadside against the monogamy
hypothesis as a whole that lacks the necessary nuance and will thus not achieve the balance you
appear to aim for.
- Pitting the monogamy idea against NTW (2010), a paper that failed to make even a single
testable prediction and that kept all its assumptions implicit, seems a tall order when the goal is
to remain balanced. Modelling in ecology and evolution is ultimately about explaining variation
in social systems of very different kinds from the same parsimonious set of first principles.
Precise definitions are part of the transparent overall approach needed to achieve that – not
merely a philosophical ‘human imposed’ issue. Evolutionary biology cannot be a serious science
if one focuses on ‘process’ without having precise language to capture process, as the author
argues in one of his responses. This contrast is particularly strange because NTW only modelled
full sib colonies, so they implicitly worked with strict monogamy as your ref 15 pointed out. I still
believe you do your mission a disservice by starting to argue from NTW (2010) in implicitly
supportive language, because these authors were never interested in a proper discussion whereas
you are.
- Assumptions of models do matter crucially (as the author highlights in line 63), but this
arguments deserves to be generalized. In evolutionary biology models should both make their
assumptions and predictions explicit, which is rarely consistently done for phenotypes in
population genetic models. Furthermore, both assumptions and predictions should be testable.
One cannot expect that tests of the predictions have been done when a model is novel, but
scientific transparency requires that modellers tell their readers how their assumptions apply to
specific groups of organisms and provide reasonable evidence that they are likely to be valid in a
35
sufficient number of cases to make the model worth the trouble. The NTW paper is a case in point
where essentially all crucial assumptions remained implicit and sometimes turned out
nonsensical when digging them out (e.g. the idea that workers do not need to be considered as
evolutionary agents). Another, already mentioned, implicit assumption in that paper was that
they in fact only considered full sib families where relatedness was constant and non-variable. I
find it hard to imagine that you endorse of practices like this and believe you have sufficient
experience as a field naturalist to agree that matching model assumptions with empirical
evidence is a point of key importance.
- The disagreement issue that you address in this essay is real, but not a discussion
between parties holding equally strong decks of cards - less than a handful empirically inclined
biologists have seen any merit in NTW (2010), about 30 times fewer than the ones who signed the
2011 rebuttals. This is why I think you do your mission a disservice by focusing on that particular
paper in the approving sense that your wording suggests. The issue is really about types of
models to be used and the assumptions that feed them. I think the author and I agree that the
significance of inclusive fitness theory has been immense. What we also should agree upon is the
‘make assumptions explicit’ issue summarized above. What (only in part) separates us is that he
appears to feel that specific population genetic models have the potential to overturn general
first-principle theory such as Hamilton’s rule, where I feel they will only complement first
principle theory. But at least here we have an issue that may well not be obvious to many
biologists, so is worth clarifying because it never appears authors like Nowak, Van Veelen, Allen
and E.O. Wilson have an interest in engaging in this discussion. My overall impression is that it
always turns out that when Nowak’s group produces an explicitly genetic model, it is just a
matter of time until someone else (e.g. Nick Davies and Andy Gardner is the most recent case)
shows those ‘overturning conclusions’ are simply a consequence of making rather extreme
assumptions about how genes affect phenotypes. But that type of discussion is not new –
Hamilton and later Dave Queller, Steve Frank, Stu West, Andy Gardner, James Marshall, Peter
Taylor, Francois Rousset, etc have all made it clear that strong selection, drift, dominance, non-
additivity, etc will make Hamilton’s rule only approximately valid or sometimes make it fail. To
see why, one should realize that as soon as one goes down the path of more specific ‘realistic’
models the extra assumptions needed (relative to the Price-equation inclusive fitness approach)
make such models less general. As Dave Queller writes in the Introduction of his 2017 AmNat
paper: ‘Levins (1966) discussed how models have to trade off between generality, realism and
precision. Kuhn (1977) similarly noted that theories face conflicts between accuracy, consistency,
scope, simplicity’, and fruitfulness. It is my clear impression that the author agrees with this but it
remains very implicit.
- The non-novelty of the NTW critique on the Price equation approach has been aptly
described by Steve Frank, a mathematical scholar on par with Nowak. If the author would care to
check his series of seven papers in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology (2011-2013), he would find
all the references to these early insights. Particularly Frank (2012) Natural selection. IV. The Price
equation (JEB 25, 1002-1019) is illuminating, because the final sections address the so called
‘controversy’. I quote: ‘This quote from van Veelen et al. (2012) demonstrates an interesting
approach to scholarship. They first cite Frank as stating that dynamic insufficiency is a drawback
of the Price equation. They then disagree with that point of view and present as their own
interpretation an argument that is nearly identical in concept and phrasing to my own statement
in the very paper that they cited as the foundation for their disagreement.’ Given this kind of
arguing, does it then surprise the author of the present essay that little appreciation for the
approach of NTW (2010) has accumulated? Another quote that the author may find interesting is
from Frank’s final paper in this series entitled Natural selection. VII. History and interpretation of
kin selection theory (JEB 26, 1151-1184, 2013) which says: ‘Nowak et al. (2010) say that one must
make a specific model for a specific case, and then one gets the right answer. True, but the history
of science shows unambiguously that one gains a lot by understanding the abstract causal
36
principles that join different cases and different models within a common framework (Frank,
2012b).’ The upshot is, as Hamilton already knew, that explicit population genetic models are
important, but they are (by definition) never general and generate few testable predictions.
- In light of the above, I retain my opinion that, for this essay to be influential, you need to
make explicit that the role of monogamy as a predictor is crucially different in social domains
where altruism is facultative (i.e. cooperative breeders) and domains where altruism is obligate
(all helpers remain unmated; hence they are true workers - what Darwin meant with ‘neuters’).
Boomsma & Gawne (2018) have the most recent and complete update of that logic. Making this
distinction is important because it seems futile you challenge the evidence for the major
evolutionary transition logic of the monogamy hypothesis given the consistent evidence (the
Smith et al. paper on Austroplatypus ambrosia beetles in Nature E&E (2018) gives a
complementary summary of what Boomsma & Gawne reviewed). You can then focus on the
cooperative breeders where becoming a helper remains facultative, so that either social nests
coexist with solitary nests (e.g. Megalopta) or where reproductive success always requires
colonial sociality but where relatedness is never high enough to create a ‘monogamy window’
(e.g. Polistes, naked mole rats, Seychelles warblers, meerkats). Focusing on that type of social
systems is useful because your summary will then make clear that: 1. Monogamy may help, but
not necessarily does help (e.g. Magalopta if maternal manipulation is real; greater anis because
they do not live in family groups so indirect fitness is moot). 2. You will be able to clarify the
misunderstanding that all social systems required a monogamy window – although never
intended by Boomsma, this is how some people have misunderstood the phylogenies in Hughes
et al. (2008). 3. That approach will put your own models in their right context for example when
making clear that monogamy is not necessarily good if there is nest inheritance. 4. It will also
allow connections with reproductive skew logic, which is about cooperative breeders that co-
breed in spite of being totipotent (skew theory is not about permanent castes and obligate
division of labor). 5. You might briefly refer to a discussion between Charlie Cornwallis & co,
Dustin Rubinstein & co, and Michael Griesser & co on what drives cooperative breeding in birds.
You will notice that what seemed a fundamental disagreement (relatedness first versus ecology
first) now appears to be evaporating because Michael Griesser talks about extended parental care
(no indirect fitness as in greater anis), and Cornwallis and Rubinstein recently published a joint
paper agreeing on (as a broad trend) monogamy (low promiscuity) having promoted the
colonization of harsh environments, but that living and radiating in harsh environments induced
secondary reversals to promiscuity, some of that related to ‘family life’ giving way to groups of
non-relatives. 6. In fact, all the six points towards the end of your paper are about cooperative
breeding (none is about obligate worker castes) so all you need to do is make that explicit. 7. It
would get you away from unfruitful discussions on whether inclusive fitness logic explains
everything. Maternal manipulation or not, the key point is that helpers always obtain non-trivial
indirect fitness benefits when they invest in helping (as they do in your refs 17-20), which is all
that matters when altruism is expressed in a facultative (context dependent) manner. It would
seem to me that an emphasis in this direction would make your essay much more valuable
because you could show that: 1. There is no fundamental disagreement between almost
everybody that different types of models serve complementary purposes. 2. That different types
of models only do that when previous insights are respected (provided they were thoroughly
documented – NTW did not show that respect), and 3. That monogamy in the sense of low
promiscuity is a statistical facilitator for cooperative breeding, not a necessary condition as it
apparently was for evolving obligate ‘neuter’ castes or, as termite researchers would say, for
evolving ‘true workers’.
- I find much of this so called ‘controversy’ frustrating, because I do not feel responsible
for it although I am happy to take credit for the monogamy hypothesis. If the author would care
to re-read the closing paragraph of Boomsma (2009) I hope he can see why. I would now not have
phrased this closing statement in sociobiology ‘eusociality language’, but by contrasting Wheeler-
37
superorganismality (obligate unmated altruism) against cooperative breeding (among totipotent
reproductive agents expressing at best facultative altruism) as done in later reviews. However,
the meaning remains the same. The cooperative breeder domain of social evolution is more
taxonomically diverse, more dynamic, and more variable in causation. Both models and
empirical evidence show that and it is by acknowledging that distinction that a more transparent
version of your essay can make a positive difference.
Specific points:
Line 16. ‘arguably intensified’ - I think this phrasing needs adjustment. To my knowledge no
new authors have joined the small group of inclusive fitness theory critics. So we would need
citations here proving that statement.
Line 17. ‘aggressively vociferous’ - This kind of language should be avoided. Overall, it would be
sufficient if lines 15-17 merely stated that no consensus has been reached. Who started making
this debate acrimonious is open to interpretation. As I explained above, most opinionated
evolutionary biologists considered NTW (2010) to be an unduly aggressive and poorly argued
attempt to discredit the most successful general theory of adaptation produced in the 20th
century.
Line 33. To keep the discussion general, I think this should say ‘as from multiple mating or
cooperative breeding of multiple females’
Line 39. ‘touted’ is unnecessary pejorative. Another case where language moderation is in order.
The statement also seems to be formally incorrect. The ‘monogamy window’ is a theoretical
concept (Boomsma, 2007, 2009, 3013) that has only been claimed to be a necessary condition for
major transitions to coloniality with permanent castes (see general comments above).
Line 42. ‘above phylogenies’? – you mean phylogenetically controlled comparative analyses?
Line 45. ‘for unexplained reasons’?? It has been known for many years (Boomsma & Ratnieks,
1996; Strassmann, 2001) that obligate multiple queen mating in ants and corbiculate bees is a
secondary derived evolutionary development, later confirmed to also apply to the vespine wasps
by the studies of Foster and Ratnieks, all well before Hughes et al. (2008). The monogamy
hypothesis provides a simple parsimonious general explanation for these convergent phenomena
by stipulating that once the point of no return to irreversibly unmated worker castes had been
passed, these secondary developments were free to evolve when they provided lasting benefits. If
workers no longer have the plasticity to opt out by mating and dispersing, then one should not
expect any group disharmony to arise except as a secondary consequence of chimeric colonies
(requiring for example worker policing as documented most thoroughly in the honey bee). This
point has been made in a single discussion sentence by Hamilton (1964), somewhat more
elaborately by Boomsma & Ratnieks (1996), and explicitly in all the monogamy review published
since 2007. That not all later empirical papers have been precise on this point cannot he held
against the hypothesis having been transparent. It is actually at this level that the authors
‘heterosis’ hypothesis works.
Line 47-55. Terms like ‘cast doubt’ and ‘very maladaptive’ are inconsistent with the evidence and
would thus best be phrased more carefully. This section claims there is repeated evidence for
worker behaviour that does not make sense from an inclusive fitness perspective. I have checked
all four studies and cannot see how they provide strong evidence for the inference that
Hamiltonian logic is problematic. Nonacs er al. (2006) tested reproductive skew models that the
author later dismissed as having limited general value (Nonacs & Hager, 2011; Biological
38
Reviews). Skew models are derived from inclusive fitness logic but failed to live up to
expectations because they needed too many special assumptions that could hardly be tested. It is
thus no great surprise that the qualitative cross-taxa predictions in the 2006 study appeared to
work, but the detailed population-level predictions did not. The second study (Rehan et al., 2014)
is about a bee where two sisters may build joint nests and where indirect fitness of subordinates
was only half the direct fitness of nesting alone. However, that study did not measure the
mortality costs of dispersing and initiating a nest alone. If that cost would be twice the failure rate
of staying as a helper, the two options would be equivalent and consistent with Hamilton’s rule
(as a mixed ESS not unlike the birds in your ref 14). The Gadagkar (2016) paper is essentially a
review of decades of work and ends with the conclusion: ‘Clearly, Hamilton’s rule provides a
powerful framework for understanding the evolution of social and altruistic behaviour in R.
marginata. Even though I have often complained that most investigators focus excessively or
exclusively on r and neglect the b and c terms in Hamilton’s rule, the power of the theory is
evident when all three factors are considered, as I have attempted to do for R. marginata.’
Kapheim et al. (2015) is the best and most recent single case study, but also here authors had to
infer what direct fitness helpers could have had in a rather indirect way. This allowed them to
quantify productivity alternatives, but they could not consider the possibility that dispersal
rather than helping would likely incur significantly higher mortality costs. In sum, none of these
studies refute inclusive fitness logic because helpers obtained measurable inclusive fitness
benefits in all cases. Such qualitative confirmations are often the best that can be achieved,
because quantifying the Hamiltonian b and c variables remains essentially impossible in natural
settings where dispersal costs are almost impossible to obtain. I suggest the author adjusts the
phrasing of this paragraph to do justice to what was really shown. As far as I can see not all
authors of these four papers have invoked maternal manipulation and Kapheim et al. only
inferred that mechanism was consistent with the data. It has not been proven.
Line 56. Having reached this point it is really hard to see the ‘dissonance’. In all cases where tests
were done (your refs 13, 14, 17-20) non-trivial indirect fitness benefits were always found,
consistent with Hamiltonian logic. If there were quantitative mismatches (the indirect fitness
benefits seeming not to be substantial enough), the most parsimonious explanation was that the
non-measured costs of dispersal were substantial.
Line 68-70. Yes of course, but this is the key argument of the monogamy window hypothesis for
the emergence of life-time unmated castes. Under strict monogamy the r-terms cancel out of
Hamilton’s rule, so all that matters is the b>c condition – i.e. what you call life-history and
ecology. Before lineages reach that point of no-return what matters if br>c. This may seem a
subtle difference, but it is not, because many combinations of b and r can make the inequality
work. You just need substantial benefits applying in particular nest settings (and not in others) to
express conditional altruism even when relatedness is modest. But altruism will never become
obligate in such scenarios. That apparently only happened when relatedness to siblings remained
identical to relatedness to offspring over a huge number of generations, i.e. a sufficient number to
irreversibly rewire complete developmental pathways (with hideously complex gene regulation
networks) to produce permanent queen and worker castes. The assumption of a worker taking
over the nest from her dead mother has never been part of the predictive domain of the
monogamy window hypothesis. It is clearly a derived trait in lineages where permanent castes
evolved, and as far as nest inheritance happens in societies with facultative altruism it may well
prevent they can reach the monogamy window needed to evolve permanent castes. I believe that
is consistent with your models, but phrasing this precisely matters for transparency of argument.
Line 75-76. The point here is whether maternal manipulation can induce irreversible transitions to
life-time true-worker castes. There is no evidence to my knowledge that this has been modelled
or observed to happen. Also the halictid systems considered in the Quinones & Pen model
39
ultimately have to converge on strict monogamy before true helper traits can go to fixation (i.e.
show the first signs of becoming irreversible).
Line 78. ‘also considered’? unclear phrasing. You mean ‘considered a scenario’?
Line 82-87. I think this summary of the Davies and Gardner paper is understating the clarity of
their results to a degree that does not serve the balanced view the author says he pursues. The
first sentence will never communicate to the unprepared reader that their analyses showed that
none of the conclusions of the Olejarz model really held up when realistic population genetics
were used. The second sentence is totally non-transparent and can easily be read as the Davies
and Gardner paper having unresolved loose ends, which I do not think was the case within the
framework they considered. I also remember the Davies and Gardner paper showing the
argument of worker sons not to hold up in their analyses, so more clear language (and references)
would be needed if you disagree.
Line 89. Once more – the original monogamy hypothesis was primarily about the evolution of
life-time unmated castes in the ants, bees, wasps and termites. Only after making that first-
principle inference did Boomsma (2007) suggest that similar tendencies might be occurring in
cooperative breeders, i.e. make the expression of facultative altruism more likely. It was that
latter part that was tested and found to be correct in cooperatively breeding birds and mammals
(Cornwallis; Lukas). Your phrasing is so general that this key point is glossed over, which
muddles the water. In cooperative breeders monogamy is a statistical predictor; for the evolution
of true workers it becomes a necessary condition. These are very different things (see general
comments above).
Line 90-91. ‘enhance, retard, or have no effect …’ as ‘overall conclusion’. Of what, of models that
did not make their assumptions explicit? I am not aware of any empirical data set that has shown
that the monogamy hypothesis was incorrect if you consider (as you should) that it never
intended to replace Hamilton’s rule in vertebrate cooperative breeders and social insects where
altruism is facultative (condition dependent).
Line 92-95. This is true, but it seems to be just restating Hamilton’s rule. No monogamy paper
every claimed to replace that logic.
Line 96-105. My compliments for the constructive language in this paragraph. This is what the
tone should be throughout this essay. You might want to add some of the 2010-2011 papers by
Van Veelen as good examples of acrimonious inclusive fitness critique.
Line 106-113. It is unclear to me why the tone of this paragraph then becomes unbalanced again. I
think ‘prosecutorial’ is once more a type of language to be avoided. All these papers did was
reason from first GENERAL principles against a paper that was broadly conceived as a very
unreasonable attack on massive progress in general understanding of social evolution based on
inclusive fitness theory (see my general intro comments). It was NTW who started ignoring all
the evidence (which you acknowledge in the previous paragraph). Objections were not
‘disingenuous’ (again wording that should be removed). All we can say is that there is
disagreement about whether single-locus modelling with strong discontinuous effects on
assumed phenotypes is useful or not (see my general comment above). Whether the mathematics
was correct is besides the point. The equations were correct in all papers as far as I know, else
criticism would have been much stronger. The point is that when assumptions are wrong, the
outcome will make no sense. In such cases results are not inconvenient (another value laden term
to be reconsidered), but irrelevant for what happens in natural populations. Please rephrase this
paragraph to achieve balanced coverage as you do in the preceding paragraph.
40
Line 112. ‘… exceptions accumulate’ I am not aware of such accumulation. Do you mean the same
four papers addressed above (refs 17-20)? You would have to give new references to justify
‘accumulate’.
Line 113. ‘uncritical’? To my knowledge almost every test of inclusive fitness theory has been an
independent challenge of the general applicability of first-principle inclusive fitness theory.
Critical attitudes in the Popperian sense have thus abounded and the theory has survived these
refutation assaults at least in a qualitative sense. You may find that having more quantitative
matches would be desirable, and I would agree. However, even the qualitative matches have
been inspiring enough to generate new avenues of derived inclusive fitness theory, as for
example David Haig’s genomic imprinting theory. By the way, also Dave Queller and Steve
Frank have always argued that both types of models are useful and complementary.
Line 114. Remove the value-laden word like ‘presciently’
Line. 118-121. NTW did not pioneer simulation modelling and simulation modelling is something
else than formal mathematical modelling. Formal mathematics provides first principle theory
such as Hamilton’s rule and its broadened version using the Price equation. Simulation models
address specific cases where multiple restrictive assumptions need to be made, and where
complexity exceeds what can be tracked analytically. As I tried to explain in my general
comments above, simulation approaches can be useful but only if the assumptions about what
phenotypes do are reasonable, and they should never claim to demonstrate something truly
general. Overselling in that way was typical for the NTW paper and because their assumptions
were often wrong or irrelevant, it gained no followers. I do not understand why the author is so
adamant to defend this paper as some kind of a ‘flagship case’. It detracts from the merits of his
own models, which are more realistic and where he is willing to be specific about assumptions
and about matches with general theory.
Line 124-125. ‘could consider’. Yes, but again the power issue is fundamentally different for
lineages where colonies have facultative altruism versus those that have obligate altruism. You
should make explicit that your point is about the former, not the latter type of social systems, and
cite the well-known review by Beekman and Ratnieks to build any new argument on that
synthesis. In fact it turns out that not only this first point, but also the following points 2-6 are
about social systems with facultative altruism (see my last general comment above).
Line 136. ‘can easily select’ …. As far as I am aware there is no evidence for this to be ‘easy’ and to
my knowledge there are no empirical data showing that selection for genetic diversity has
produced consistent group adaptations in cooperative breeders. Reference 41 reports patterns
across empirical studies but without addressing whether drifting ‘workers’ are potential
reproducers or not. The only exceptions of unambiguous group adaptations owing to higher
(chimeric) genetic diversity within groups appear to have happened after the point of no return
to superorganismality had been passed. I.e., honeybee and leaf-cutting ant colonies deal better
with disease when they have more patrilines and costly obligate multiple queen mating is
therefore a functional adaptation. Whether drifting workers can be considered to be a group
adaptation remains to be proven and seems unlikely from a general theoretical perspective –
these phenomena are merely effects of something else that could easily not have a functional
adaptive significance (see Williams, 1966, for an important discussion about function and effect).
Referring to ‘indirect reciprocity’ is unhelpful if you do not add a few lines of explanation of how
that concept connects to what this essay is about.
Line 140-141. The monogamy hypothesis has always emphasized life-time (obligate)
41
unmatedness, not obligate sterility, which requires diploidy to be an automatic consequence of
unmatedness.
Line 144-146. This is a hand-waving statement. The monogamy hypothesis predicts (both in the
early reviews and more explicitly in the later ones, which you should cite if you aim to be
balanced) that such reversals should not have happened. That prediction has been consistent with
all available evidence so far (see Boomsma & Gawne 2018 and Smith et al. 2018 for updates), so a
statement like this is misleading unless you can cite empirical papers that have provided
evidence to the contrary. A more productive approach would be to make sure you acknowledge
that the ‘monogamy window’ hypothesis for major transitions to caste societies is something else
than facilitating monogamy in cooperative breeders (see my general comments) – and focus on
the latter.
Line 147. The monogamy (window) hypothesis is about how facultative altruism can be replaced
by obligate altruism, not about cooperation.
Line 148-150. Yes, it should work both ways, but only if relatedness is a true variable as in
cooperatively breeding vertebrates, Polistes wasps, halictid bees etc. Once more, the core idea of
the monogamy hypothesis is that strict full-sibling relatedness makes the relatedness terms
cancel. That was apparently a necessary condition for major irreversible transitions to higher
organismal complexity (both colonial superorganismality and obligate multicellular
organismality), but not a sufficient one (the Leggett et al. paper – your ref 7 – also makes this
point). Only long-term consistent b>c benefits will forge major irreversible transitions after the
necessary condition is fulfilled and that is a tall order. This entire point 3 is fine if you make
explicit it is about cooperative breeders only (just like the other 5 points). In such ‘societies’
monogamy is never strict. References 4 and 8 are perfectly up front about that. Reference 3 was
not, but you cannot hold that against the monogamy hypothesis. It is easy to plot the major
irreversible transitions on the Hughes et al (2008) phylogeny (the base of the corbiculate bees, the
base of the higher termites, the base of the vespine wasps). What you say here applies basal to
those transitions, not beyond them – the later monogamy reviews have been very explicit about
that, but that logic is also in the 2007 and 2009 versions. Irreversibility of transitions to coloniality
where all individuals belong to a complementary caste for life (Wheeler superorganismality) is
not just an assumption, it is consistent with all comparative data both for superorganismality and
obligate multicellularity (cf Smith et al. Nature E&E 2018, Fisher et al. Current Biology 2013,
Boomsma & Gawne, 2018).
Line 151-156. Yes, Polistes colonies and human groups are societies, albeit very different ones
because we have cumulative culture driving our social evolution. So again this is a ‘society’
argument, but it has no bearing on the strict type of monogamy window hypothesized to
represent a necessary condition for the emergence of obligate altruism in superorganisms (which
no longer are societies of totipotent individuals). Once more, it would be useful if you somehow
made these distinctions explicit when you intend this essay to be a way forward.
Line 158. ‘sometimes’? Sibling competition within groups is generally and principally important
as Hamilton and May (1977), Steve Frank (JEB 2012), Stu West & Ido Pen, and Leggett et al. (your
ref 7) have amply documented. The group benefits you have in mind here are just the
Hamiltonian b>c values. Also your point 5 is about family groups before permanent castes
evolve.
Line 162. And so is point 6. The Riehl work is very interesting, but not as a challenge of the
monogamy hypothesis for altruism driven by indirect fitness benefits, because two key
conditions do not apply: 1. ‘helpers’ gain no inclusive fitness – they just hang around to receive
42
prolonged parental investment. 2. These greater anis are not family groups where altruism could
have evolved.
Line 168-172. The final quote is nice, but should in my opinion refer to the need to test both the
assumptions and the predictions of any model used to better understand social evolution. It has
no specific bearing on ecology and group-level benefits, which are fully covered by Hamilton’s
rule as the series of Steve Frank papers in JEB (2011-2013) amply document. Does it have bearings
on genetics? Yes, quite possibly so, but remember Hamilton’s rule is about genetics as well. If you
want to make the genetics more explicit that can be useful, but it will always imply making
restrictive assumptions that the Price equation (general inclusive fitness) approach does not need
to make. If you keep adding special assumptions in order to gain ‘realism’, you may end up with
a model that is very precise about a scenario that may never apply in nature. See my general
comments and the Queller quote given above on how generality and precision of models trade-
off. Both approaches are valuable when assumptions about individual and colony phenotypes are
reasonable – and then they are complementary ways towards understanding. Models with
inappropriate or unspecified assumptions are not useful. I think that should be a major condition
for making your ‘verify’ by modelling credible, but the final arbiter of course remains what the
empirical data show.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Alexander Ophir):
Dear Dr. Nonacs,
Thank you for your responses to the last round of reviewer comments. At this point I feel that
you have done as good a job as you can to represent your point of view while also trying to
accept and address the constructive feedback that you have been given. It is becoming evident
that you and Dr. Boomsma (self-identified reviewer 2) have strong disagreements for many
things, but with a few places of agreement.
I commend you both for trying to look past your steadfast disagreements and trying to produce a
manuscript that offers an alternative that is, as far as I can tell, valid but unpopular. For this
reason, I think your paper will be of great value to the literature. For the critics that give it a fair
read, your paper can serve as a counter point to generate experiments and models that might
help strengthen their point of view and address your critique. For those that are more agnostic or
supportive of your point of view, this can serve as a call to arms to think about this problem
differently and also to generate experiments and models that will move the field forward. In all of
these cases, this will be a win for the community. There may be some critics that read and
represent your paper unfairly. It sounds like this will (unfortunately) be nothing new to you. The
best we can hope for in science is that we do our best to seek and find truth. I appreciate your
efforts, and the efforts of the reviewers to this end.
Kind regards,
Alex Ophir

ments to the Author(s)
is comment, Prof. Nonacs gives his view of the inclusive fitness controversy and related issues, partly
ugh the lens of two recent papers: Olejarz et al (2015, eLife) and Davies and Gardner (2018, Royal Society
n Science).
arz et al (2015) analysed a model of the evolution of voluntary worker non-reproduction in haplodiploid
ct societies and found that monogamy sometimes promotes and sometimes inhibits the evolution of worker
lity. Davies and Gardner (2018) analysed the same model and found that the results of Olejarz et al. were
to restrictive assumptions concerning the genetics of worker sterility. When we (Davies and Gardner)
xed these assumptions, we found that monogamy actually has a clear promoting effect on the evolution of
er sterility.
ve to say that I don't agree entirely with Prof. Nonacs' interpretation of my paper, but I do appreciate that he
ing to propose a way forward here and so I'll mainly restrict myself in this review to commenting on what I
as a few small matters of factual correctness. I don't think any of these problems are fundamental to what
ing said in this comment piece more generally, but do need to be addressed.
s 82–84: "Davies and Gardner [24] expanded this analysis by allowing sterility alleles to be intermediate in
effect and beneficial to the queen in allowing her to gain more reproduction."
first part of this sentence is right, but the second part doesn't seem right to me. Olejarz et al. made the
mption that the p_z function (proportion of male eggs produced by the queen) would be an increasing
tion of z. We adopted the same assumption. Therefore I don't think this can be described as a way in which
xtended the analysis of Olejarz et al. To be clear, we did extend their analysis, but we did so by (1)
wing sterility alleles to be intermediate in their effect, (2) considering the long-term evolution of worker
lity rather than the short term invasibility of particular alleles, and (3) looking at a broader range of worker
lity scenarios.
ly. Revised as suggested.
related note, further up in this paragraph, it is stated that Olejarz et al. assumed that "the production of
ker-derived] males competes with and possibly reduces the number of males that are queen-produced."
is technically right but I think phrased in a way that could be clearer. Olejarz et al. made the assumption
queen male production increases with worker sterility, so I feel like the word "possibly" isn't quite right here.
rall production depends on both r_z and p_z, so you *could* get a situation where worker sterility causes
yone's production to decrease (decreasing r_z), which *could* reduce the queen's male production overall
ending on p_z), but I think overall the way this is described here might be a little confusing to readers.
ly. “possibly” was replaced with “might” to give it a more indefinite feel. Davies and Gardner do a good job
arsing Olejarz’s assumptions. As the point I am getting at is that the differing conclusions can be seen
e as a function of model assumptions rather than mathematical error, I don’t I need replicate the entirety of
’s arguments. Readers can jump into those papers for themselves.
s 92–94: Davies and Gardner [24] respond to Olejarz et al [12] by declaring that "monogamy always
otes... worker sterility" without qualifying that this requires traits to be expressed additively..."
spend quite a lot of the paper exploring alternative scenarios in which worker sterility is dominant or
ssive, so I don't know where this is coming from—we absolutely do not require traits to be expressed
tively.
ly. This entire paragraph did not survive the revision!
s 124–126: "The degree to which parents or siblings can impose complete or almost complete sterility on
group mates will determine whether the Olejarz et al. [12] or Davies and Gardner [24] models are more
opriate."
ot sure I understand this—we make the same assumptions as Olejarz et al when it comes to who is
rolling sterility, so I don't think whether parents or siblings can impose sterility on their group mates has
hing to do with whether our analysis is more appropriate than Olejarz et al.'s.
ly. I ended up combining this point with #1 and this has been deleted.
lly, I wonder if the author would consider toning down the last paragraph just a little. I have always
eciated Prof. Nonacs' point of view, which has come to me through peer review a couple of times, and I
eciate that he makes his points in a measured way and does not seek to bury papers that he disagrees
. I also agree in general with the assessment in this paragraph that diversity of opinion can be fruitful and
excessive dogmatism is unhelpful. But I don't think I or my coauthor can fairly be described as people who
ider "proving their opponents wrong" to be the most important thing, and it feels a bit like that is what is
g said here. I worked on this paper during my PhD and I would never want to discourage anyone from
ting to study social evolution. In fact, I met with Carl Veller (one of the authors on Olejarz et al, who was a
student like me at the time) in person to ask him for feedback on the paper, and because I didn't want the
ors—especially the less senior ones—to feel like there was any bad blood between us. So although I'm
this wasn't Prof. Nonacs' intention, the final paragraph feels a little bit unfair to me.
ly. What I originally wrote here reflects a lot of what I’ve heard people say in interviews, at meetings, and
etimes in confidential messages to me as an editor about the ‘other’ side. And I’ve found that both
rating and counterproductive. However, my intention was for this comment to end on a more positive note
I see where the closing paragraph does not achieve that. It has been toned down!

eral reply. It surprises me that this reviewer is so focused on the ‘monogamy hypothesis’, which was
ifically mentioned only once in the original version (and appropriately relative to a paper that was explicitly
eling it).
response to the same objection being raised multiple times below, I would question the reviewer’s
ention that somehow the initial evolution of facultative reductions in fecundity differs from the evolution of
ate sterility in the predicted effect of higher relatedness (e.g., as through monogamy). The basic
iltonian inclusive fitness relationship is the same: individuals evolutionarily sacrifice direct fitness to
ase indirect fitness. Certainly, a number of papers have enthusiastically adopted the “hypothesis” in the
ext of the initial evolution of cooperative group living. Indeed, Boomsma et al’s (2011) published response
owak et al. (NTW) directly claimed monogamy as the vital precursor to both the initial evolution of
oductive altruism and the later evolution of sterile castes. Granted, the rebuttal dropped the word
othesis”, but it would seem inconceivable that the authors did not think the same dynamic was involved.
ever, this reviewer’s discomfort suggests that I missed my goal of showing the debate over the role of
ogamy as the best exemplar of the controversy between those attacking inclusive fitness theory and those
nding it. I have revised the manuscript in multiple ways that I believe better achieves my intentions. I also
rly delineate when I am considering the initial evolution of facultative sterility versus the obligate version.
ments to the Author(s)
manuscript evaluates the extent to which monogamy promotes altruistic cooperation. It is not completely
r to me why Peter Nonacs appears to feel that there are scientific reasons for considering possible
natives to inclusive fitness theory for explaining patterns and processes of social evolution, which he does
actice in spite of his closing sentence. Apart from the reference to Nowak et al (2010) nothing in his own
(which appears in several hypothesis-ideas towards the end of the manuscript) seems to justify that. I
efore believe that much of this essay sees controversy and disagreement where there in fact is none,
ided one is clear about terms and definitions and the ways in which they were messed up when
obiology became influential.
ly. I honestly do not see how any objective reader of the literature since 2010 could conclude that no
roversy or disagreement over inclusive fitness exists. To broaden the points I am trying to make, I cite a
e complete set of dueling attacks and defenses.
e four comments below I attempt to clarify this overall assessment. After that I provide specific comments
reference to line numbers:
Nowak et al. (2010) has nothing to do with the topic at hand. The reference to the Nowak et al. (2010)
er at the start of this manuscript is odd. That paper ignored the monogamy hypothesis (in spite of two
msma reviews of 2007 and 2009) having laid it out in considerable detail and the Science paper by Hughes
. (2008) having shown it was supported by considerable empirical evidence. The Nowak et al. challenge of
sive fitness theory was thoroughly refuted by a series of 5 rebuttals of which only one (Boomsma et al.,
1) explicitly addressed monogamy – the total number of authors involved was ca. 150 (not 134 as Nonacs
s). The agenda of the Nowak et al. paper failed, because a scientific challenge of a major paradigm needs
chieve two things: 1. It needs to allow easy understanding of all insights already validated under the
ious paradigm (in this case the 16 subfields listed with triple ‘yes’ in Table 1 of the Abbot et al. rebuttal that
marized the overwhelming empirical and modelling confirmation of inclusive fitness theory), and 2. Such a
lenge needs to add a series of new testable predictions that were not valid questions under the existing
digm, and that would have sufficient initial support to open up entire new research fields. This is what
ivity theory (Einstein) and quantum theory (Bohr) did when they built on and enriched Newton mechanics.
ing like that was achieved by Nowak et al. (2010). Their statement of ‘meagre’ support is simply wrong.
her did their paper allow the recapture of any previous understanding or generate a single novel testable
iction. It therefore seems inappropriate to start the introduction of the present manuscript with Nowak et al.
0). It would also be nice if Nonacs could actually mention more explicitly that the monogamy hypothesis
been very well supported by empirical data, not unexpectedly as it is in fact just an extension of Hamilton’s
and the inclusive fitness theory behind.
ly. NTW is clearly relevant to this discussion as it is the initiating event that spawned controversy and led to
continuing debate. True NTW did not specifically go after monogamy, but Olejarz et al is a direct
endent of the arguments presented there and, of course, Nowak is also a co-author. In the revised
ion, I make this overall connection clearer.
ieve 134 was the number of authors that signed the Abbot et al. paper (or was it 137?). While obviously I
NTW had something very useful to say, I also think it was a polemic that was excessive in several ways. I
ld note that I was one of the 150 respondents, where I published a (single authored!) complaint about their
mple’ of the haplodiploid hypothesis as a failure of inclusive fitness. This idea had actually been rejected a
ber of years earlier, in part, by inclusive fitness type models!
Nonacs’ formulation of the central prediction of the monogamy hypothesis is incorrect. Nonacs appears to
epresent what the monogamy hypothesis actually predicts. He is not the only one, because the Hughes et
Science 2008) paper testing the empirical evidence as provided by the then available comparative data is
ally not very precise in how it phrased the idea being tested. If Nonacs is interested in evaluating the status
e monogamy hypothesis, he should therefore go back to its exact formulation by Boomsma, both in the first
w cited by Hughes at al. (Current Biology 2007) and reread the precise phrasing in the review paper that
ites (Boomsma 2009). That should reveal that the monogamy hypothesis was ONLY meant to explain the
ution of life-time physically differentiated castes, not the evolution of all altruistic cooperation as the title of
present Nonacs manuscript suggests. It was stated explicitly that this concerned the evolution of
rorganismality sensu Wheeler, which Boomsma coined ‘obligate eusociality’ struggling with the ‘eusociality
ition’ that Wilsonian sociobiology had left the field with. It has become increasing clear (and has been
essed in increasingly explicit language by Boomsma (2009, 2013), Boomsma, Huszár & Pedersen (2014),
Boomsma & Gawne (2018) that sociobiology terminology is a smokescreen because its ‘eusociality’ does
discriminate between first helpers at the nest and life-time differentiated castes. The monogamy hypothesis
r claimed to explain all aspects of what determined first helpers at the nest. It is about predicting the
rgence of obligate altruism, not of facultative (condition-dependent) forms of altruism (facultative eusociality
e Boomsma reviews). Nonacs has made this interpretational mistake in his earlier modelling papers, which
ow admits (e.g. nest inheritance), but his present text continues to repeat some of the same
pprehensions. His arguments thus acquire several strawman characteristics and they are already apparent
e title of the manuscript (the monogamy hypothesis is not about cooperation because reproductive altruism
operation).
ly. In neither the original nor this revision am I particularly concerned with Boomsma’s narrowly defined
nogamy hypothesis”. Instead, I focus on the broader effect of relatedness across several aspects of social
ution. This is clearer in the revision.
everyone agrees with Boomsma on how to define eusociality. His definition, like every other one, ends up
problematic exceptions and inclusions. I prefer to look at process and not get distracted by human-
sed categorizations and definitions.
Assumptions should be explicit and biologically realistic for models to be meaningful. It is of crucial
rtance for evaluating the assumptions that go into any model meant to describe the evolutionary origin of
rent types of altruistic phenoptypes. The previous Nonacs models have always addressed the origin of
ers at the nest, not the origin of obligatory altruistic castes, i.e. the irreversible transition to Wheeler-
rorganismality which implies that ALL colony members belong to a single adult caste phenotype for
The monogamy hypothesis never intended to challenge the recurrent origins of facultative (condition-
endent) altruism through the simple logic of Hamilton’s rule (rb>c).
ly. Not true. Nonacs (2014) specifically models this proposed evolutionary scenario.
three variables vary freely there can be situations where lower than full–sib relatedness still allowed some
ring to become helpers at the nest, for example because they were poorly endowed as adult phenotypes
ernal manipulation could play a role here, but note that mothers also need to weigh how they get most
es passed on to grand-offspring by making offspring disperse rather than stay). However, what the life-time
ogamy hypothesis states is that it cannot be expected that this will ever lead to the evolution of
anently unmated workers (true workers as termite researchers aptly call them; neuters as Darwin and
eler conceptualized them). The monogamy hypothesis is about the evolution of obligate (unconditional)
ism, a distinction that is not made in the Hughes et al (2008) paper but that is explicit in the Boomsma
ws. Most examples that Nonacs highlights are about the origin of first helpers at the nest, and none is
ut helping behaviour going to fixation so that physically differentiated permanent castes appear. If Nonacs
ld make that distinction, most of the rationale for his critique would seem to disappear. The same rationale
utlined here also pervaded the recent Davies and Gardner paper, so the Nonacs critique appears to
pare apples and oranges. A recent modelling paper by Quinones & Pen (Nature Communications, 2017)
shows clearly that strict monogamy is a necessary condition for the evolution of obligate, not facultative
oductive altruism. The Nonacs (2011, 2014) papers thus appear to have their assumptions wrong for them
e relevant as tests of the monogamy hypotheses for permanent castes – they address the evolution of first
ers.
ly: Again, I believe that the initial evolution of helping behavior and the evolution of sterile worker castes is
pples to apples comparison. Quinones&Pen is interesting and illuminating in its own way (moreover this
er is also about the origination of facultative behavior and not the evolution of obligate castes!). However,
here in their model do they allow offspring to inherit nests. Hence, their results mirror those of
mhage&Kokko. I suspect if you include inheritance, then you’d get something like Nonacs (2011).
The proposed ‘alternative’ hypotheses towards the end of the manuscript. Some of these appear to be
esting research agendas, but others seem rather far-fetched and lack more than hand-waving justification.
e importantly, however, very few if any of them are directly relevant for testing the monogamy hypothesis in
riginal meaning.
pe the following line-by-line comments will clarify these general points.
26: ‘eusociality’ here lumps societies and superorganisms, which Boomsma & Gawne show are
amentally different social systems, going back to Darwin, Weismann, Wheeler, Fisher, Williams and others
e way through the 1960s, until sociobiology started to water down and muddle these definitions. The
msma reviews (particularly 2013) also make this point, emphasizing that Crespi & Yanega (1995) and
kman et al (2006) also criticized the ‘eusociality continuum’ ideas emanating from the watered down
itions by E.O. Wilson in the 1970s.
ly. The definition of eusociality is a philosophical point and the reviewer will find any number of people
greeing with Boomsma. Fortunately mathematical models are blissfully insensitive to what we call things.
s, Hamilton’s rule is widely applicable across taxonomic groups and different manifestations of cooperation.
is its strength and value. But, I did drop “eu” from this sentence.
29: Refs 9+10+12 had their modelling assumptions wrong for the monogamy hypothesis as originally
ulated by Boomsma, which ref. 12 partly rectifies and the recent Davies&Gardner paper makes more
icit. You also admit that later on, but without stating the explicit reasons. There is also a semantic issue
. Empirical data can never be ‘put to mathematical tests’, not even in physics. Mathematical models can be
to derive predictions from axiomatic assumptions that can then be empirically tested, not the other way
nd. Being precise about this distinction is crucial particularly in evolutionary biology, where the main
tion of models is to make sense of empirically observed variation in social behaviours and life-histories –
hing beyond that is illusionary.
ly. To be clear, the tests are whether or not a prediction from Hamilton’s inequality holds when placed into
volving population model. It often does not (Lines 40-41).
30: The monogamy hypothesis is not about the evolution of cooperation (for mutual benefits) but about the
ution of obligate reproductive altruism. What Hughes et al. (2008) and Cornwallis et al. (2010) tested was
ther low parental promiscuity favors facultative reproductive reproductive altruism (with for social insects
ate reproductive altruism as a putative later extension). They never tested the hypothesis in its most
gent version originally proposed.
ly. True, but then those papers cannot be cited as support for the monogamy hypothesis, as they often are
luding in this review!
32-33: When you conceptualize the evolution of permanent true worker castes as an evolutionary point of
eturn (i.e. a major evolutionary transition), as all Boomsma reviews since 2007 have done, the later
sitions to multiple queen mating and polygyny (the latter primarily in ants – see Boomsma, Huszár &
ersen, Animal Behaviour 2014) are not relevant for the argument, because by then true worker castes
d no longer go back to facultative (condition-dependent) altruism. Also here ‘cooperative behaviour’ is an
curate description of what the monogamy hypothesis is about (same in Line 35).
ly. That a sterile worker caste cannot evolutionarily revert to being fertile is an assumption and not a proven
To my knowledge, it has never been explicitly demonstrated. Given that sterile workers contain all the
ded functional genes to be reproductively capable, and that much of social evolution involves changes in
latory genes, it seems eminently possible for evolutionary reversions to at least arise. Alternative
utionary pathways in which the worker or queen castes are simply lost (as in parasite or gamergate
ies) are common. Again, to my knowledge none of these are correlated with reduced relatedness. None
oomsma’s papers have ever convincingly argued for why relatedness (e.g., through monogamy) appears to
unidirectional force working only towards increased division of reproduction.
w include this as one area that might be fruitful to look into (Lines 139-150)
35-40: Once more, the monogamy hypothesis is not about these cases. If daughters stay to help even
gh they could have dispersed, there is no reason to question that they do that because the inequality
ified by Hamilton’s rule compels them to do so. Because these cases represent facultative altruism, it is
cted that measured average direct and indirect fitnesses are in fact equal (representing a frequency
endent ESS equilibrium where both strategies do equally well). This is what the cited studies report and it is
onsistent with inclusive fitness theory, even though the papers try to argue otherwise – very little if anything
ese decision making processes can be shown to be maladaptive or challenging established inclusive
ss theory (line 41-42). But the main issue is that none of this challenges the monogamy hypothesis for its
iction of major evolutionary transitions to superorganismality as defined by Wheeler (Boomsma & Gawne,
8).
ly. The reviewer is completely wrong here. In each of the 4 papers cited there is no evidence for a
uency dependent ESS is which females that stay to help do equally well as dispersing females. ‘Choosing’
ecome a helper is a maladaptive decision from the helper’s perspective.
44: The above implies there is no dissonance between theory and empirical results as implied here,
ided one phrases the predictions and assumptions of the Boomsma hypothesis correctly, rather than
ng them into uninformative sociobiology jargon that Boomsma tried to avoid.
ly. There certainly is dissonance across Fromhage & Kokko versus Nonacs in terms of each paper’s
lusions! The point of the paragraph here is that their differences follow entirely from a difference in one
mption that each model makes. Thus, neither paper is wrong from a mathematical perspective. They are
modelling different worlds. My argument in this comment is that this same pattern of dueling models on
e aspect of social evolution reflect more about differences in assumptions rather than that one method is
ed.
50: Again, the argument is not about cooperation but about reproductive altruism.
ly: OK, revised.
56-58: How do you define ‘a species’ sociobiology’? It would seem preferable to me to avoid vague
uage like this. Once more all of this is about the expression of condition-dependent facultative altruism with
ithout simultaneous direct fitness gains (captured by mutualistic cooperation) – nothing of what is here
ears to challenge the monogamy hypothesis for the evolution of obligate reproductive altruism.
ly: Replaced sociobiology with ecology. However, the argument has nothing to do with condition-
endent facultative altruism. Instead, it is about the fitness consequences for a given behavior across
ring social life histories.
59-63: Also this point seems misplaced as criticism of the monogamy hypothesis, because it seems to
esent a ‘parasocial’ arrangement, which the Boomsma reviews explicitly excluded as ancestral state for the
ution of superorganismality in the Wheeler sense.
ly. In rereading the paper, I realized the points being made in this paragraph were out of place relative to
low of the rest of the manuscript; causing confusion. It has been deleted.
63-67: This makes sense to me, but it is perhaps premature to highlight here based on just a submitted
er, particularly because all of this seems consistent with the Hamiltonian paradigm that ecology (the b/c
n in Hamilton’s rule) is as decisive as the relatedness terms when all three vary at the same time, as is
ys the case when evaluating cases of condition-dependent expression of facultative reproductive
ism. All the monogamy hypothesis did was claim that maximal and invariable relatedness was a
ssary condition for making major evolutionary transitions to obligate reproductive altruism with
anently unmated workers – so for this kind of transitions relatedness comes first, cancels out of Hamilton’s
so that b/c >1 comes to represent the sufficient condition for actually making such transitions. A recent
er (Smith, Kent, Boomsma, Stow, Nature Ecology and Evolution 2018) shows that this proof of concept
s fine to explain the evolution of life-time unmated workers in an ambrosia beetle – the commentary by
Davies summarizes that very well.
ly. Part of the deleted paragraph.
67-69: I think this point has been made earlier in a Keller and Reeve model – all fine. It just has no direct
ing on the assumptions and predictions of the Boomsma monogamy hypothesis.
ly. Same deleted paragraph.
70: ‘Recently the monogamy debate has extended …’ ?? If you carefully read the Boomsma reviews all
way back to 2007 you will see that this was the core of the argument right from the start – even though the
uage was made more explicit in later reviews. Ref 10 confuses the evolution of first helpers at the nest with
point of no return to obligate reproductive altruism, which are very different things. Even though some
rs have also confused these issues in previous papers, you cannot hold the logic presented by Boomsma
onsible for that confusion.
ly. I absolutely disagree – Nonacs 2014 is not about 1st helpers. Note that the title of the paper is:
olving the evolution of sterile worker castes: a window on the advantages and disadvantages of
ogamy”. It is a direct response to Boomsma’s 2013 claim that prior models (such as Nonacs 2011) were
mining the wrong evolutionary transition. Thus, the model starts with a cooperative group with
oductively capable workers. It then examines under what conditions can worker sterility spread. The
ngs are that sometimes monogamy is favorable, sometimes it is irrelevant, and sometimes it retards the
ad of sterility.
the deletion of the distracting paragraph immediately before this one in the original version, there is now a
r delineation between models testing the origin of facultative sterility and those testing for obligate sterility
es 56-87).
75-76: No, of course not. But maternal manipulation is only a (partial) alternative explanation to voluntary
oductive altruism in social systems where some nests retain helpers and other nests do not. All those
mics are covered by the classic dynamics of Hamilton’s rule and have no bearing on the monogamy
thesis as formulated for the evolution of life-time unmated nursing castes.
ly. Maternal manipulation is an alternative explanation to voluntary sterility (and not partial at all – see
heim et al. 2015, #19 in the References). Monogamy is irrelevant with manipulation; hence the importance
bling relatedness depends entirely on the degree to which parents can and do manipulate offspring into
ervience!
76-87: For all I know, Davies & Gardner showed that the Olejarz et al. model was unsatisfactory because
rked with caricature single locus variation with extreme phenotypic effects. Ever since Alan Grafen wrote
well-known phenotypic gambit paper in the 1980s the field has been clear about complex social traits being
ely independent of such single locus extreme effects. Making models of that kind (as Olejarz, Nonacs, and
e others like to do), therefore has possible bearing on the first (facultative) expression of reproductive
ism, but not on the evolution of permanently sterile castes, which requires significant rewiring of complex
e-regulation networks depending on many genes with small effects. That is why social traits are best
idered to have quantitative genetic variation with overall heritabilities that determine how such traits
ond to selection, but without significant single-gene effects. I would think this should also apply to many
s of the expression of facultative helping when governed by the type of phenotypic plasticity proposed by
y Jane West Eberhard. Also here it is hard to conceptualize how complex behavioural reaction norms are
endent on single locus variation with extreme phenotypic effects.
ly: As a criticism of Olejarz & Nonacs, this equally applies to Boomsma’s work, which by framing the
ogamy hypothesis as purely an inclusive fitness question neglects the same complexity. Boomsma just
mes the complexity will align with his hypothesis. So I am not sure what the reviewer’s point here is. I
ld argue that Davis&Gardner, Olejarz et al & Nonacs are at least a step mathematically closer to the actual
utionary genomics. I don’t expect that any of these papers have given the final answer, but they have
en closer to it.
98-100: I disagree with this blanket statement, because it suggests that all arguments have equal merits
ss the board. The Boomsma monogamy hypothesis has met with unambiguous support for the predictions
it actually made (major transitions to Wheeler superorganismality and to obligate multicellularity cf. Fisher,
wallis & West, Current Biology 2013). Other models, among them some by Nonacs, have shown that
s are more complex for facultative reproductive altruism. Under the assumptions stated, these models are
y correct, but they are not at variance with the monogamy hypothesis as original framed. They shed light on
s of haplodiploid cooperative breeding and complement more general insights in (usually diploid)
erative breeding in other arthropods and vertebrates. When taking that broader perspective, haplodiploidy
tually quite an idiosyncratic issue, because it implies that unmatedness does not necessarily imply sterility
does in diploids. I think also that should be taken into account when evaluating the merits of a loser
ion of the monogamy hypothesis that has now been tested and found to be essentially correct in many
id cooperative breeders (alpaeid shrimp, cooperatively breeding birds, cooperatively breeding mammals,
see recent Boomsma reviews for references).
ly. It is true that Fisher et al. find that most transitions to multicellularity they surveyed were from clonal
stors, but a significant fraction were not. It is a matter of personal preference as to whether or not one
iders that to be “unambiguous” support (also, one might argue that to be consistent with the objection
d multiply in this review – it is not a test of the monogamy hypothesis of facultative sterility evolving into
ate sterility). However, one must also consider that multicellularity requires single cells to be in close
imity – a constraint often easier to overcome within a clone than with non-clones. Anyway the evolution of
icellularity is a different paper to be considered on a different day.
104-142: This list is likely to be in need of qualifications as current relevance seems doubtful. 1. Bourke &
ks (1995) argue that maternal manipulation is essentially a Hamiltonian concept, as was agreed upon by
ard Alexander, so any discussion of the validity of this idea should be framed in that context. Also
ipulating mothers are under selection to maximize their inclusive fitness, so manipulating provisioning of
ghters in their larval stages so they stay should not give mothers fewer grandchildren than provisioning
optimally so they can disperse and breed.
ly. Kapheim et al 2015, found that mothers are maximizing their fitness at the expense of daughters that
as helpers. The clear and obvious point is that if helping is a manipulated result, then the question of
ogamy or not, is moot.
o far ‘social heterosis’ has never been shown to play a role empirically for facultative reproductive altruism;
s for obligate altruism in honeybees and leaf-cutting ants with obligate multiple queen mating. It seems
ial to acknowledge that distinction.
ly: I would point out that clonal multicellularity has evolved perhaps around a dozen times in the history of
earth. Interspecific facultative and obligate mutualism has evolved independently perhaps millions of times.
is social heterosis. Almost all multicellular ‘species’ are actually a close association of themselves and
microbiomes. Given we are all “holobionts”, social heterosis may well be involved. Phylogenetic analyses

do not think it is appropriate to capture humans and paper wasps under the same heading – overall none of

his seems misguided because the monogamy hypothesis is about obligate reproductive altruism (and in
obligate multicellular soma as well) evolving ‘voluntarily’. That is why maximal (invariable) relatedness is
because it makes the r-terms cancel out of Hamilton’s rule. That makes the power issue brought up here
t. The Davies & Gardner model acknowledges that, any model coming out of Nowak’s group does not.
ly. I have merged the idea of control here with point #1, which is similar.
s far as ‘groups’ are parasocial aggregations, this argument is irrelevant for the monogamy hypothesis
h requires colony founding by a life-time monogamous pair.
ly. However, it is relevant whether grouping with close kin or not is fitness enhancing.
so this point seems hardly relevant, because outbreeding is normally secured in social systems. The few
s in which societies have offspring hanging around that do not obtain indirect fitness are irrelevant for the
ogamy hypothesis. As Michael Griesser argued (recent PLOS Biology paper) there are forms of family life
essentially represent extended parental care. They will imply interesting social dynamics, but there is no
vance to the monogamy hypothesis when offspring do not help to obtain indirect fitness benefits.
ly. It may be important as regards monogamy when one sex can gain direct fitness in the natal nest and the
r cannot. Short answer – I don’t know, but it would be interesting to consider.
. Also these topics do not seem relevant for the monogamy hypothesis. They are of interest, but have been
terest ever since inclusive fitness theory was proposed so are hardly novel; antagonistic interlocus genetics
ains poorly understood even in sexual selection research – it seems hardly relevant as a pressing research
nda here.
ly. #7 is deleted, #8 I realized is just another way of expressing #5 and they have been merged.
m, the title of the paper is too broad for the issues the paper actually evaluates. The monogamy
thesis was never about cooperation for mutual direct fitness benefits, but only about the evolution of
ate reproductive altruism. Suggesting it was more by using ‘cooperation’ muddles the water. Many of these
opics are of interest, but just not in the context at hand.
ly. Title has been changed to reflect more the overall thrust of this comment.
145-149: All valuable scientific theory is dogmatic. How else would Einstein and Bohr have succeeded
acing Newton mechanics? G.C. Williams explicitly emphasized the need for biological theory to also be
gent, so its predictions are vulnerable to falsification – that is why he explicitly endorsed inclusive fitness
ry in his 1966 book Adaptation and Natural Selection. Neither I nor any others who have developed or
d the monogamy hypothesis have ever claimed it will be relevant for any social system. However, the
ing has been increasingly precise about what is predicted and what is not (see particularly Boomsma
ws from 2013, 2014 and 2018), and these exclude scenarios involving the expression of facultative
oductive altruism with less than maximal sibling relatedness or cooperation for mutual direct benefits.
ly. In response to Davies, this paragraph has been much toned down.
149-153: As far as I am aware we know of no examples where ‘emergent group level benefits’ have been
wn to challenge inclusive fitness theory. In general, any invocation of ‘emergence’ is unhelpful for scientific
ress. As J.B.S. Haldane wrote: ‘Particularly hostile to true scientific progress are the
emer forms of emergence ….. [S]cience is committed to the attempt to unify human experience by
aining the complex in terms of the simple - The Causes of Evolution (1932). I think Peter Nonacs adheres
is principle when he closes off writing “Trust in inclusive fitness, but verify”. However, it would then help for
taining transparency in the literature if he would refrain from sociobiology terminology that was never
ded to accurately capture the assumptions and predictions of inclusive fitness theory, and from using
wman versions of extensions of inclusive fitness theory to line up arguments that do not address real
es.

Comments to the Author(s)
As before, I am limiting myself to commenting upon issues of factual
correctness, especially regarding Davies and Gardner (2018), rather than
issues of interpretation or opinion. That's not to say that I think natural history
is a matter of opinion. As the author states, people might disagree on how to
define eusociality or any other word, but I don't agree that this is merely a
"philosophical" issue because some definitions increase our understanding
and others don't.
Because I'm an author of the piece that is being commented upon, I think this
is the appropriate role to take here and although I don't agree with everything
being said here, my feeling is that that debate is better held in the open.
Lines 26-29. I think the relatedness term in Hamilton's rule is incorrectly
defined here, because it seems like c is the number of foregone offspring for
the actor, and b is the number of additional offspring for the recipient, so then
r should be the relatedness between the actor and the recipient, not the
relatedness between the actor and the recipient's offspring. (Or alternatively,
c needs to be multiplied by the relatedness to the actor's offspring.)
No, the equation in the paper is correct. The recipient in this case is the extra
siblings reared. This is the benefit accrued to the colony. What the actor
sacrifices (its cost) is the offspring it will not have. The confusion is that
relatedness is often ‘built into’ the c term. Hence, the monogamy hypothesis
posits that cooperation is favored when r1b > r2c. For one’s own offspring, r2,
is always 0.5 (which is why it often is not explicitly stated), and for full sibs
then the r values cancel and cooperation is favored when b > c. For half sibs,
b > 2c must hold for cooperation to be favored. This is the basis for any
version of the “monogamy hypothesis”. I made this explicit rather than
implicit in the revision.
Line 40. This is just a comment. In my view, there are two (related) reasons
why the cited models don't conform with Hamilton's rule (rb > c). One is that
some of the studies assume that altruistic phenotypes are encoded by alleles
of large effect. I hope it is becoming increasingly clear to theorists and
practitioners that predictions made from models that assume quantitative
genetics or which make equivalent assumptions such as additivity of allelic
effects (as Hamilton did in deriving rb > c; also see previous comment on
quantitative genetics from reviewer 2) cannot simply be transposed into a
model that assumes alleles of large effect. A lot of the disagreement over
inclusive fitness really boils down to this issue. My own view is that the
quantitative view is the more general one, since it is equivalent to the
assumption that mutations of intermediate effect will eventually arise in a
population. It also has empirical support for the reasons mentioned by
reviewer 2. Finally, in cases where the predictions made by quantitative
genetics and the predictions made by biallelic models diverge the most, that
is precisely when there will be the strongest selection for an allele of
intermediate effect to spread. So I really think there is good reason to believe
that, over evolutionary time, populations will tend to conform to predictions
made by quantitative-genetic models rather than models with alleles of fixed
effect.
I have to say I have seen this objection raised more than once and wonder if
it is more expectation than fact. I have sometimes for my own edification
replicated my simulation models to just check this out, with multiple alleles
that are additive in effect and with small or intermediate effects (plus with
linkages, etc) – and gotten the same or very similar results. Beyond this, I
don’t see any universal justification for why a more quantitative view would
always be expected to recapitulate Hamilton’s rule – as it seems to be the
assumption. No matter on which side of this argument you stand, I still think
that the central point of my comment stands. There are better simulation
methods to model the evolution of cooperation than the highly limiting
inclusive fitness approaches.
The second reason is that Hamilton's rule—in the strict sense of rb > c—is
designed to analyse a specific social phenotype, in which an actor gives up
some of their reproductive fitness in order to increase the reproductive fitness
of a relative and there are *no other impacts to their actions*. One can't take
rb > c and apply it unthinkingly when there are other things going on, like
male production by workers, nest inheritance, and so on. The way that
Gardner, myself and others apply inclusive fitness theory is by first building a
model which (hopefully) captures the relevant phenomenon, then interpreting
the results in terms of inclusive fitness, not by starting with rb > c and trying to
fit it to every social evolutionary problem that involves altruism. For example,
Davies and Gardner (2018) don't end up with rb > c, but a more complex
condition.
I think this is entirely true, but often ignores the point of view problem. For
example, in a social insect colony, there is the queen, non-reproductive
workers and potentially reproductive workers. All have different versions of
rb>c. Not everyone’s fitness can be maximized simultaneously. To predict
the outcome, one must therefore know who holds the power. Monogamy
matters most if it is the potentially reproductive worker and not at all if it is the
mother. This is what Nonacs (2014) shows and my greatest problem with
Olejarz et al and Davies & Gardner. Both look only one point of view. An
interesting extension would be to what the outcome would be if power was
shared across all 3 actors. I don’t see how this question could ever be
answered by an inclusive fitness model, even though Hamilton’s rule is the
genesis of what makes it an interesting question in the first place.

Comments to the Author(s)
I appreciate the efforts by the author to clarify a number of points that I raised
in my first review, which has given a better balance overall. However, my
comments below will emphasize that further revision would be desirable if this
paper is to serve the authors’ purpose of pointing towards a way forward.
General comments:
- It remains puzzling to me that the author seems to think he can discuss
the merits of monogamy as a key explanatory variable without precisely
referring to where the idea comes from and how it developed. Before
Boomsma (2007) the concept simply did not exist, except as a few
throwaway sentences by Hamilton, Dawkins and Cronin (the introduction of
that first review has the citations). If you choose a title like the one you have
now, and aim to make a contribution that could ease a perceived controversy,
you will have to relate to the concept as it was developed between 2007 and
2018 and at least briefly mention the consistent empirical evidence for it. This
mentioning should differentiate between the strict monogamy (window)
hypothesis for major transitions to permanent castes, and monogamy as
reduced promiscuity serving as statistical predictor of the expression of
context-dependent (facultative) altruism. These two aspects are really
different issues and not acknowledging that difference muddles the water.
The central role of monogamy in determining social insect life histories and
reproduction was first brought to high prominence by the Trivers & Hare 1976
paper, and then by my papers (among others) in the late 80’s. In what is a
short comment, there is not really the space to devote to the full history of
how high relatedness through monogamy has been proposed to have
evolutionary effects for many aspects of the sociobiology of Hymenoptera
(consider that the Boomsma & Gawne paper that delves into the
terminological history is 27 pages long!). I think it is clear enough that many
believe monogamy to be quite important, while notable others have called the
central role of relatedness into question.
More seriously, as in my previous response I absolutely do not agree
with Boomsma’s premise that the evolution of facultative and obligate sterility
are evolutionarily different processes. The effects of monogamy, in the
context of Hamilton’s rule, are viewed as critical to both. Furthermore, I
disagree that with the contention that obligate sterility in social insects is a
major evolutionary transition (an MET). Whether or not it is, this an argument
for a different paper and would only be a distraction in my short comment
- If you did (re)read the full spectrum of monogamy reviews, you would
notice that monogamy was ONLY claimed to have been a universal
necessary condition
Exactly!!! And this claim is what several models are specifically challenging!
(and NOT a sufficient condition) for the evolution of life-time unmated
castes.
Exactly!!! And these other conditions, such as parental manipulation, would
make the question of monogamy or not, irrelevant!
I really do not know how to make these points any clearer in my
paper.
It has also been made clear from the start (and in increasingly precise
language in later reviews) that in all societies of cooperative breeders (e.g.
halictids, Polistes, lower termites, naked mole rats, snapping shrimp,
meerkats, family living birds) the three parameters of Hamilton’s rule always
vary simultaneously (even when relatedness is high). This implies that the
monogamy hypothesis had nothing fundamentally new to say about those
social systems were multiple (often most) co-breeding individuals have
independent agency (totipotency) – the hypothesis only claimed to
parsimoniously explain the handful of convergent major transitions to obligate
eusociality (Wheeler superorganismality; Boomsma & Gawne, 2018) where
that independent agency has irreversibly disappeared. If you write (line 19)
that ‘No single topic better exemplifies the ongoing controversy than the
question of what role does monogamy play in the evolution of reproductive
division of labor within cooperating family associations’, you just have to be
explicit that you address monogamy as it applies to societies of cooperative
breeders, not the strict major transitions monogamy-window hypothesis.
The next sentence after the one quoted above, does exactly that. Again, the
published papers examine both cooperative breeders and the supposed
MET. It is fundamentally the same argument as to the value of Hamilton’s
rule and what types of models best elucidate the possible evolutionary
progressions.
- With this in mind, I remain unsure whether I understand your title
‘Hamilton’s rule is essential but insufficient for understanding monogamy’s
role in social evolution’. I think we agree on the first part, but I do not
understand the ending. The strict monogamy-window hypothesis is just a
reduction of Hamilton’s rule (the r terms cancel) and if monogamy is not
100% the standard version of Hamilton’s rule continues to capture everything
as a first-principle theory. So what is insufficient in your title supposed to
mean?
Hamilton’s rule, rb – c > 0 is the entire theoretical basis for Boomsma’s
monogamy hypothesis. Above he claims the hypothesis to be universally
true. This is a logical fallacy along the lines of: “All people named John are
men; therefore all men must be named John”. Of course, all men could be
named John, but it is not a certainty that they are. Thus, although Hamilton
could be both essential and sufficient, a whole series of population genetic
models (Nonacs 2010, 2014 and Fromhage and Kokko if properly evaluated)
reveal that cooperation pays off more in a group where full sibs are helped,
but across the entire population, more groups of half-sibs receive help. The
two end up cancelling each other out and therefore the spread of cooperation
occurs equally fast, independent of mating strategy. Hence Hamilton’s rule is
insufficient to easily or adequately capture this sort of probabilistic
consequence.
We know that inclusive fitness is the sum of direct fitness and indirect fitness,
so do you mean that direct fitness benefits are often essential as long as
altruism remains facultative? But that is true by definition according to
Hamilton’s rule. Even if mothers would manipulate daughters against their
interests (for which the evidence is weak, but getting stronger & stronger as
another study – Snell & Rehan - has just been published while this comment
was being reviewed), parental manipulation does not represent something
alien to inclusive fitness theory.
Of course it is part of inclusive fitness theory, but the key point is that
manipulation makes monogamy irrelevant.
Bourke and Franks (1995) have some pages of text explaining this. If this
essay is to meant to objectively map out what we (dis)agree on and what is
perhaps subject to debate, I think you should make clear that the monogamy
(window) hypothesis predicted how major transitions to permanent castes
have come about and then add that this may have confused readers to
believe monogamy was an essential condition for all forms of social evolution.
You could then proceed outlining why this is not the case and how/why
Hamiltonian logic allows a variety of social traits to be maintained either for
reasons of cooperation (no relatedness involved) or by facultative expression
of altruism, or (perhaps) by offspring being manipulated into maximizing their
mother’s fitness. Anything else will be perceived as a broadside against the
monogamy hypothesis as a whole that lacks the necessary nuance and will
thus not achieve the balance you appear to aim for.
This comment is basically asking me to rewrite the paper to reflect
Boomsma’s views and perspectives on MET’s and the role of Hamilton, when
it is clear that I do not share them. The paper is in no way a blanket
broadside on either monogamy or the effects varying levels of relatedness
might have. Rather, I am pointing out that the issues are demonstrably more
complicated and nuanced than Boomsma’s rather simplistic black vs white
view on NTW and the issues they and subsequent authors raise.
- Pitting the monogamy idea against NTW (2010), a paper that failed to
make even a single testable prediction and that kept all its assumptions
implicit, seems a tall order when the goal is to remain balanced. Modelling in
ecology and evolution is ultimately about explaining variation in social
systems of very different kinds from the same parsimonious set of first
principles. Precise definitions are part of the transparent overall approach
needed to achieve that – not merely a philosophical ‘human imposed’ issue.
Evolutionary biology cannot be a serious science if one focuses on ‘process’
without having precise language to capture process, as the author argues in
one of his responses. This contrast is particularly strange because NTW only
modelled full sib colonies, so they implicitly worked with strict monogamy as
your ref 15 pointed out. I still believe you do your mission a disservice by
starting to argue from NTW (2010) in implicitly supportive language, because
these authors were never interested in a proper discussion whereas you are.
I agree that NTW (2010) was not an invitation to discuss. It was a
“broadside” and unsubstantiated denunciation of a rather successful field of
study. The follow-up papers from the group have also unfortunately
continued in their over the top hyperbole, which concerns me greatly.
Nevertheless, when one looks behind the rhetorical excesses, there are valid
points being made. Hence, a discussion is warranted, even if the people who
started it all refuse to do so graciously.
- Assumptions of models do matter crucially (as the author highlights in
line 63), but this arguments deserves to be generalized. In evolutionary
biology models should both make their assumptions and predictions explicit,
which is rarely consistently done for phenotypes in population genetic
models.
Which is why Hamilton is so valuable – it gives you phenotypes to be
modeled! I.e., the “essential” part of my title.
Furthermore, both assumptions and predictions should be testable. One
cannot expect that tests of the predictions have been done when a model is
novel, but scientific transparency requires that modellers tell their readers
how their assumptions apply to specific groups of organisms and provide
reasonable evidence that they are likely to be valid in a sufficient number of
cases to make the model worth the trouble. The NTW paper is a case in point
where essentially all crucial assumptions remained implicit and sometimes
turned out nonsensical when digging them out (e.g. the idea that workers do
not need to be considered as evolutionary agents). Another, already
mentioned, implicit assumption in that paper was that they in fact only
considered full sib families where relatedness was constant and non-variable.
I find it hard to imagine that you endorse of practices like this and believe you
have sufficient experience as a field naturalist to agree that matching model
assumptions with empirical evidence is a point of key importance.
This is, of course, what I tried to do in Nonacs (2010,2014 & 2017). The
results of the models were not always supportive of simplistic conclusions
drawn from Hamilton’s rule such as the need for universal monogamy. No
one has shown any of these papers to be wrong.
- The disagreement issue that you address in this essay is real, but not a
discussion between parties holding equally strong decks of cards - less than
a handful empirically inclined biologists have seen any merit in NTW (2010),
about 30 times fewer than the ones who signed the 2011 rebuttals.
Truth in science is not a popularity contest where the majority vote is always
right. Otherwise, we’d be standing on a 6000 year old, flat earth, at the
center of the solar system.
This is why I think you do your mission a disservice by focusing on that
particular paper in the approving sense that your wording suggests. The
issue is really about types of models to be used and the assumptions that
feed them. I think the author and I agree that the significance of inclusive
fitness theory has been immense. What we also should agree upon is the
‘make assumptions explicit’ issue summarized above. What (only in part)
separates us is that he appears to feel that specific population genetic
models have the potential to overturn general first-principle theory such as
Hamilton’s rule, where I feel they will only complement first principle theory.
Again, I don’t think we have or likely will overturn Hamilton in the sense that
rb – c > 0 will be shown to be universally or even often locally false (although
never say never!). And I did and do state this (L 118-119; 168-169). I would
use the word “elucidate” and not “complement” for the relationship of pop gen
to Hamilton.
But at least here we have an issue that may well not be obvious to many
biologists, so is worth clarifying because it never appears authors like Nowak,
Van Veelen, Allen and E.O. Wilson have an interest in engaging in this
discussion.
I do agree, but after several suggestions to “tone down” previous versions of
this manuscript, it is perhaps wiser not to go there in print.
My overall impression is that it always turns out that when Nowak’s group
produces an explicitly genetic model, it is just a matter of time until someone
else (e.g. Nick Davies and Andy Gardner is the most recent case) shows
those ‘overturning conclusions’ are simply a consequence of making rather
extreme assumptions about how genes affect phenotypes.
I would not necessarily call all the assumptions extreme. More like limiting,
and then there usually is a rebuttal that critiques the critiques and points out
their limitations and possibly flawed assumptions. Moreover, peer review
keeps letting these papers, critiques and rebuttals be published, so they must
be finding an accepting audience.
But that type of discussion is not new – Hamilton and later Dave Queller,
Steve Frank, Stu West, Andy Gardner, James Marshall, Peter Taylor,
Francois Rousset, etc have all made it clear that strong selection, drift,
dominance, non-additivity, etc will make Hamilton’s rule only approximately
valid or sometimes make it fail. To see why, one should realize that as soon
as one goes down the path of more specific ‘realistic’ models the extra
assumptions needed (relative to the Price-equation inclusive fitness
approach) make such models less general. As Dave Queller writes in the
Introduction of his 2017 AmNat paper: ‘Levins (1966) discussed how models
have to trade off between generality, realism and precision. Kuhn (1977)
similarly noted that theories face conflicts between accuracy, consistency,
scope, simplicity’, and fruitfulness. It is my clear impression that the author
agrees with this but it remains very implicit.
- The non-novelty of the NTW critique on the Price equation approach has
been aptly described by Steve Frank, a mathematical scholar on par with
Nowak. If the author would care to check his series of seven papers in the
Journal of Evolutionary Biology (2011-2013), he would find all the references
to these early insights. Particularly Frank (2012) Natural selection. IV. The
Price equation (JEB 25, 1002-1019) is illuminating, because the final sections
address the so called ‘controversy’. I quote: ‘This quote from van Veelen et
al. (2012) demonstrates an interesting approach to scholarship. They first cite
Frank as stating that dynamic insufficiency is a drawback of the Price
equation. They then disagree with that point of view and present as their own
interpretation an argument that is nearly identical in concept and phrasing to
my own statement in the very paper that they cited as the foundation for their
disagreement.’
I would say that the arguments over the Price equation still continue to this
day, with quite notable and talented mathematicians on both sides. If there
were an obvious answer and satisfactory to all – this would have been settled
a long time ago.
Given this kind of arguing, does it then surprise the author of the present
essay that little appreciation for the approach of NTW (2010) has
accumulated? Another quote that the author may find interesting is from
Frank’s final paper in this series entitled Natural selection. VII. History and
interpretation of kin selection theory (JEB 26, 1151-1184, 2013) which says:
‘Nowak et al. (2010) say that one must make a specific model for a specific
case, and then one gets the right answer. True, but the history of science
shows unambiguously that one gains a lot by understanding the abstract
causal principles that join different cases and different models within a
common framework (Frank, 2012b).’ The upshot is, as Hamilton already
knew, that explicit population genetic models are important, but they are (by
definition) never general and generate few testable predictions.
I argue that pop gen models are in a sense, mathematical tests of inclusive
fitness predictions. If the IF model ‘fails’ the test, the results provide insight
as to why they failed. I think that my previous papers are exemplars of this.
As for making testable predictions, yes they do. I would also point out, that
testing the maximize fitness prediction from IF models is about the hardest
publishing endeavor I ever faced as a researcher (see the Nonacs & Richard
comment).
- In light of the above, I retain my opinion that, for this essay to be
influential, you need to make explicit that the role of monogamy as a predictor
is crucially different in social domains where altruism is facultative (i.e.
cooperative breeders) and domains where altruism is obligate (all helpers
remain unmated; hence they are true workers - what Darwin meant with
‘neuters’). Boomsma & Gawne (2018) have the most recent and complete
update of that logic. Making this distinction is important because it seems
futile you challenge the evidence for the major evolutionary transition logic of
the monogamy hypothesis given the consistent evidence (the Smith et al.
paper on Austroplatypus ambrosia beetles in Nature E&E (2018) gives a
complementary summary of what Boomsma & Gawne reviewed). You can
then focus on the cooperative breeders where becoming a helper remains
facultative, so that either social nests coexist with solitary nests (e.g.
Megalopta) or where reproductive success always requires colonial sociality
but where relatedness is never high enough to create a ‘monogamy window’
(e.g. Polistes, naked mole rats, Seychelles warblers, meerkats). Focusing on
that type of social systems is useful because your summary will then make
clear that: 1. Monogamy may help, but not necessarily does help (e.g.
Magalopta if maternal manipulation is real; greater anis because they do not
live in family groups so indirect fitness is moot). 2. You will be able to clarify
the misunderstanding that all social systems required a monogamy window –
although never intended by Boomsma, this is how some people have
misunderstood the phylogenies in Hughes et al. (2008). 3. That approach will
put your own models in their right context for example when making clear that
monogamy is not necessarily good if there is nest inheritance. 4. It will also
allow connections with reproductive skew logic, which is about cooperative
breeders that co-breed in spite of being totipotent (skew theory is not about
permanent castes and obligate division of labor). 5. You might briefly refer to
a discussion between Charlie Cornwallis & co, Dustin Rubinstein & co, and
Michael Griesser & co on what drives cooperative breeding in birds. You will
notice that what seemed a fundamental disagreement (relatedness first
versus ecology first) now appears to be evaporating because Michael
Griesser talks about extended parental care (no indirect fitness as in greater
anis), and Cornwallis and Rubinstein recently published a joint paper
agreeing on (as a broad trend) monogamy (low promiscuity) having promoted
the colonization of harsh environments, but that living and radiating in harsh
environments induced secondary reversals to promiscuity, some of that
related to ‘family life’ giving way to groups of non-relatives. 6. In fact, all the
six points towards the end of your paper are about cooperative breeding
(none is about obligate worker castes) so all you need to do is make that
explicit. 7. It would get you away from unfruitful discussions on whether
inclusive fitness logic explains everything. Maternal manipulation or not, the
key point is that helpers always obtain non-trivial indirect fitness benefits
when they invest in helping (as they do in your refs 17-20; no they do NOT
always gain significant indirect fitness!), which is all that matters when
altruism is expressed in a facultative (context dependent) manner. It would
seem to me that an emphasis in this direction would make your essay much
more valuable because you could show that: 1. There is no fundamental
disagreement between almost everybody that different types of models serve
complementary purposes. 2. That different types of models only do that when
previous insights are respected (provided they were thoroughly documented
– NTW did not show that respect), and 3. That monogamy in the sense of low
promiscuity is a statistical facilitator for cooperative breeding, not a necessary
condition as it apparently was for evolving obligate ‘neuter’ castes or, as
termite researchers would say, for evolving ‘true workers’.
I would say that across the dueling papers, the proper conclusion is yes,
monogamy can act as a facilitator under some sets of condition. However,
this is a far cry from the “universality” claim made in comments above. Both
exercises in modeling and field date require a more careful consideration of
the role high relatedness might play.
- I find much of this so called ‘controversy’ frustrating, because I do not
feel responsible for it although I am happy to take credit for the monogamy
hypothesis. If the author would care to re-read the closing paragraph of
Boomsma (2009) I hope he can see why. I would now not have phrased this
closing statement in sociobiology ‘eusociality language’, but by contrasting
Wheeler-superorganismality (obligate unmated altruism) against cooperative
breeding (among totipotent reproductive agents expressing at best facultative
altruism) as done in later reviews. However, the meaning remains the same.
The cooperative breeder domain of social evolution is more taxonomically
diverse, more dynamic, and more variable in causation. Both models and
empirical evidence show that and it is by acknowledging that distinction that a
more transparent version of your essay can make a positive difference.
I don’t think Boomsma is responsible for the controversy except in the sense
that he put out a specific prediction/conclusion that others have challenged
with mathematical representations. But, as I have repeatedly stated, I
fundamentally differ from Boomsma in that I view facultative and obligate
sterility as a distinction without an evolutionary difference.
The majority of Boomsma’s general recommendations are to write a
paper that agrees and reflects his particular world view. I, however, do not
share large portions of that view. He has expressed his views, at great
length, in several published papers. What I am asking for is to represent an
alternative opinion in rather a short comment.
Specific points:
Line 16. ‘arguably intensified’ - I think this phrasing needs adjustment. To my
knowledge no new authors have joined the small group of inclusive fitness
theory critics. So we would need citations here proving that statement.
If one looks at the authors cited publishing with Nowak or E. O. Wilson just in
this comment, one sees new names joining in on subsequent papers. The
fact that it was suggested that I write this comment in the first place stems
from another instance of a back & forth between Olejarz et al and Davies &
Gardener. I guess that I too can be added to the list of growing critics.
Line 17. ‘aggressively vociferous’ - This kind of language should be avoided.
Overall, it would be sufficient if lines 15-17 merely stated that no consensus
has been reached. Who started making this debate acrimonious is open to
interpretation. As I explained above, most opinionated evolutionary biologists
considered NTW (2010) to be an unduly aggressive and poorly argued
attempt to discredit the most successful general theory of adaptation
produced in the 20th century.
Revised to be toned down. (Although I would point out that Boomsma’s
comments about NTW in this review could be fairly called aggressively
vociferous! But they do tend to stay out of the peer-reviewed lit.)
Line 33. To keep the discussion general, I think this should say ‘as from
multiple mating or cooperative breeding of multiple females’
Changed.
Line 39. ‘touted’ is unnecessary pejorative. Another case where language
moderation is in order. The statement also seems to be formally incorrect.
The ‘monogamy window’ is a theoretical concept (Boomsma, 2007, 2009,
3013) that has only been claimed to be a necessary condition for major
transitions to coloniality with permanent castes (see general comments
above).
Websters dictionary: Tout – to praise or publicize lavishly. As a word, I don’t
see it as pejorative, but I did change it to “presented”.
Line 42. ‘above phylogenies’? – you mean phylogenetically controlled
comparative analyses?
Yes, changed.
Line 45. ‘for unexplained reasons’?? It has been known for many years
(Boomsma & Ratnieks, 1996; Strassmann, 2001) that obligate multiple queen
mating in ants and corbiculate bees is a secondary derived evolutionary
development, later confirmed to also apply to the vespine wasps by the
studies of Foster and Ratnieks, all well before Hughes et al. (2008). The
monogamy hypothesis provides a simple parsimonious general explanation
for these convergent phenomena by stipulating that once the point of no
return to irreversibly unmated worker castes had been passed, these
secondary developments were free to evolve when they provided lasting
benefits. If workers no longer have the plasticity to opt out by mating and
dispersing, then one should not expect any group disharmony to arise except
as a secondary consequence of chimeric colonies (requiring for example
worker policing as documented most thoroughly in the honey bee). This point
has been made in a single discussion sentence by Hamilton (1964),
somewhat more elaborately by Boomsma & Ratnieks (1996), and explicitly in
all the monogamy review published since 2007. That not all later empirical
papers have been precise on this point cannot he held against the hypothesis
having been transparent. It is actually at this level that the authors ‘heterosis’
hypothesis works.
High relatedness is touted as a predisposing factor towards increasing
cooperation. If so, why is not then lowering relatedness a predisposing factor
towards increasing conflict? This is my challenge to kin selection advocates
as there always seem to be rationalizations why lowering relatedness does
not produce conflict. Remember, I am not convinced with the “irreversible”
contention that some species are trapped into reproductive sterility.
Line 47-55. Terms like ‘cast doubt’ and ‘very maladaptive’ are inconsistent
with the evidence and would thus best be phrased more carefully. This
section claims there is repeated evidence for worker behaviour that does not
make sense from an inclusive fitness perspective. I have checked all four
studies and cannot see how they provide strong evidence for the inference
that Hamiltonian logic is problematic. Nonacs er al. (2006) tested
reproductive skew models that the author later dismissed as having limited
general value (Nonacs & Hager, 2011; Biological Reviews). Skew models are
derived from inclusive fitness logic but failed to live up to expectations
because they needed too many special assumptions that could hardly be
tested.
Not true. The most basic assumption and therefore the strongest prediction
from skew theory was that relatedness was of paramount importance to
predicting group interactions. This was almost never found to be the case.
All the models to date have been based on Hamiltonian first principles and
modeled in explicitly inclusive fitness terms; not special assumptions. The
models’ failure must inevitably reflect back on how they were constructed and
their claim to generality.
It is thus no great surprise that the qualitative cross-taxa predictions in the
2006 study appeared to work, but the detailed population-level predictions did
not. The second study (Rehan et al., 2014) is about a bee where two sisters
may build joint nests and where indirect fitness of subordinates was only half
the direct fitness of nesting alone. However, that study did not measure the
mortality costs of dispersing and initiating a nest alone. If that cost would be
twice the failure rate of staying as a helper, the two options would be
equivalent and consistent with Hamilton’s rule (as a mixed ESS not unlike the
birds in your ref 14). The Gadagkar (2016) paper is essentially a review of
decades of work and ends with the conclusion: ‘Clearly, Hamilton’s rule
provides a powerful framework for understanding the evolution of social and
altruistic behaviour in R. marginata. Even though I have often complained
that most investigators focus excessively or exclusively on r and neglect the b
and c terms in Hamilton’s rule, the power of the theory is evident when all
three factors are considered, as I have attempted to do for R. marginata.’
And the title of the paper is: “Evolution of social behaviour in the primitively
eusocial wasp Ropalidia marginata: do we need to look beyond kin
selection?”, with the answer being yes.
Kapheim et al. (2015) is the best and most recent single case study, but also
here authors had to infer what direct fitness helpers could have had in a
rather indirect way. This allowed them to quantify productivity alternatives, but
they could not consider the possibility that dispersal rather than helping would
likely incur significantly higher mortality costs. In sum, none of these studies
refute inclusive fitness logic because helpers obtained measurable inclusive
fitness benefits in all cases. Such qualitative confirmations are often the best
that can be achieved, because quantifying the Hamiltonian b and c variables
remains essentially impossible in natural settings where dispersal costs are
almost impossible to obtain. I suggest the author adjusts the phrasing of this
paragraph to do justice to what was really shown. As far as I can see not all
authors of these four papers have invoked maternal manipulation and
Kapheim et al. only inferred that mechanism was consistent with the data. It
has not been proven.
Kapheim et al (I am a coauthor here) had survival data for 180 nests in the
field from the point where a nest was initiated to where it finally failed. The
only survival data missing was the brief period of time where a female leaves
her natal nest to point where she initiates her nest. This period may be as
short as a few days. Based on productivity data from the 180 nests, we could
calculate what the dispersal mortality rate would need to be for working and
dispersing to have equal fitness. In essence, that rate had to be several
orders of magnitude greater than what was observed across any part of the
nesting period. Such a mortality rate would mean the entire Megalopta
population was dying at unsustainable rates and ought to have gone to
extinction in 2 generations.
Line 56. Having reached this point it is really hard to see the ‘dissonance’. In
all cases where tests were done (your refs 13, 14, 17-20) non-trivial indirect
fitness benefits were always found, consistent with Hamiltonian logic. If there
were quantitative mismatches (the indirect fitness benefits seeming not to be
substantial enough), the most parsimonious explanation was that the non-
measured costs of dispersal were substantial.
As argued above, the most parsimonious explanation is actually workers are
manipulated into being workers.
Line 68-70. Yes of course, but this is the key argument of the monogamy
window hypothesis for the emergence of life-time unmated castes. Under
strict monogamy the r-terms cancel out of Hamilton’s rule, so all that matters
is the b>c condition – i.e. what you call life-history and ecology. Before
lineages reach that point of no-return what matters if br>c. This may seem a
subtle difference, but it is not, because many combinations of b and r can
make the inequality work. You just need substantial benefits applying in
particular nest settings (and not in others) to express conditional altruism
even when relatedness is modest. But altruism will never become obligate in
such scenarios. That apparently only happened when relatedness to siblings
remained identical to relatedness to offspring over a huge number of
generations, i.e. a sufficient number to irreversibly rewire complete
developmental pathways (with hideously complex gene regulation networks)
to produce permanent queen and worker castes. The assumption of a worker
taking over the nest from her dead mother has never been part of the
predictive domain of the monogamy window hypothesis. It is clearly a derived
trait in lineages where permanent castes evolved, and as far as nest
inheritance happens in societies with facultative altruism it may well prevent
they can reach the monogamy window needed to evolve permanent castes. I
believe that is consistent with your models, but phrasing this precisely
matters for transparency of argument.
In response to the previous round of criticism, this paragraph deals explicitly
with how the origin of cooperative behavior (not castes) arose and could be
affected by monogamy – and why the models that dealt with that specific
evolutionary event came to different predictions.
Line 75-76. The point here is whether maternal manipulation can induce
irreversible transitions to life-time true-worker castes. There is no evidence to
my knowledge that this has been modelled or observed to happen. Also the
halictid systems considered in the Quinones & Pen model ultimately have to
converge on strict monogamy before true helper traits can go to fixation (i.e.
show the first signs of becoming irreversible).
This is a frustrating comment. My paragraph describes the results of sets of
simulation models from several papers that explicitly examine the issue of the
reproductive fate of developing offspring. One paper (mine) found that it
easily occurs with maternal manipulation. What is wrong with that math?!
Line 78. ‘also considered’? unclear phrasing. You mean ‘considered a
scenario’?
Yes – changed.
Line 82-87. I think this summary of the Davies and Gardner paper is
understating the clarity of their results to a degree that does not serve the
balanced view the author says he pursues. The first sentence will never
communicate to the unprepared reader that their analyses showed that none
of the conclusions of the Olejarz model really held up when realistic
population genetics were used. The second sentence is totally non-
transparent and can easily be read as the Davies and Gardner paper having
unresolved loose ends, which I do not think was the case within the
framework they considered. I also remember the Davies and Gardner paper
showing the argument of worker sons not to hold up in their analyses, so
more clear language (and references) would be needed if you disagree.
As Davies is the other reviewer on this comment and seems to be
comfortable with my description, I believe I will leave it as is.
Line 89. Once more – the original monogamy hypothesis was primarily about
the evolution of life-time unmated castes in the ants, bees, wasps and
termites. Only after making that first-principle inference did Boomsma (2007)
suggest that similar tendencies might be occurring in cooperative breeders,
i.e. make the expression of facultative altruism more likely. It was that latter
part that was tested and found to be correct in cooperatively breeding birds
and mammals (Cornwallis; Lukas). Your phrasing is so general that this key
point is glossed over, which muddles the water. In cooperative breeders
monogamy is a statistical predictor; for the evolution of true workers it
becomes a necessary condition. These are very different things (see general
comments above).
Once more, this paper is NOT just about the 2007 version of the monogamy
hypothesis!
Line 90-91. ‘enhance, retard, or have no effect …’ as ‘overall conclusion’. Of
what, of models that did not make their assumptions explicit? I am not aware
of any empirical data set that has shown that the monogamy hypothesis was
incorrect if you consider (as you should) that it never intended to replace
Hamilton’s rule in vertebrate cooperative breeders and social insects where
altruism is facultative (condition dependent).
Looking across all the times monogamy has been modeled, there is the
variety of results. In no case was the actual math done in those papers
shown to be flawed.
Line 92-95. This is true, but it seems to be just restating Hamilton’s rule. No
monogamy paper every claimed to replace that logic.
I repeat the above comment.
Line 96-105. My compliments for the constructive language in this paragraph.
This is what the tone should be throughout this essay. You might want to add
some of the 2010-2011 papers by Van Veelen as good examples of
acrimonious inclusive fitness critique.
Line 106-113. It is unclear to me why the tone of this paragraph then
becomes unbalanced again. I think ‘prosecutorial’ is once more a type of
language to be avoided. All these papers did was reason from first GENERAL
principles against a paper that was broadly conceived as a very
unreasonable attack on massive progress in general understanding of social
evolution based on inclusive fitness theory (see my general intro comments).
It was NTW who started ignoring all the evidence (which you acknowledge in
the previous paragraph). Objections were not ‘disingenuous’ (again wording
that should be removed). All we can say is that there is disagreement about
whether single-locus modelling with strong discontinuous effects on assumed
phenotypes is useful or not (see my general comment above). Whether the
mathematics was correct is besides the point. The equations were correct in
all papers as far as I know, else criticism would have been much stronger.
The point is that when assumptions are wrong, the outcome will make no
sense. In such cases results are not inconvenient (another value laden term
to be reconsidered), but irrelevant for what happens in natural populations.
Please rephrase this paragraph to achieve balanced coverage as you do in
the preceding paragraph.
The balance requested by Boomsma is quite odd. Apparently I am an
excellent writer when I find flaws with NTW and similar papers, but become
unbalanced when I point out anything problematical about inclusive fitness
and models and the papers written to defend it.
I will not change the word “disingenuous” unless it is to say “lied” or
“dissembled”. The papers I cite never engaged substantively with my models
or findings. Instead, they cavalierly dismissed the results for reasons that
were either entirely irrelevant to what I did or outright attributed something to
the models that was not a part of them. Boomsma is right that Nowak,
Wilson and their immediate colleagues write papers that seem geared to
inflame rather than generate a positive discussion. But I see the same utterly
dismissive tone in many of the responses to those papers that are equally
discouraging to reasoned discussion. As someone who has seen his work
grossly misrepresented, I feel justified in calling out the papers that do so.
Please note that there is a critical distinction between disagreement
and disparagement. This review by Boomsma show lengthy disagreement
with what I have written. But in all instances Boomsma criticizes accurately
what I say. He is fair (even if I think he is also wrong). In this comment and
revisions, I make no attempt to hide my disagreements either, but always in
response to what authors actually said or claimed. When in review,
something I wrote was thought to be misleading, I revise to not be so. From
personal discussions with colleagues on both sides of this question, I know
there is anger that the ‘other’ side misrepresents their work just to score
rhetorical points.
Line 112. ‘… exceptions accumulate’ I am not aware of such accumulation.
Do you mean the same four papers addressed above (refs 17-20)? You
would have to give new references to justify ‘accumulate’.
Models and data. Let’s revisit this in a decade from now! I suspect there are
more studies out there that will accumulate the evidence.
Line 113. ‘uncritical’? To my knowledge almost every test of inclusive fitness
theory has been an independent challenge of the general applicability of first-
principle inclusive fitness theory. Critical attitudes in the Popperian sense
have thus abounded and the theory has survived these refutation assaults at
least in a qualitative sense. You may find that having more quantitative
matches would be desirable, and I would agree. However, even the
qualitative matches have been inspiring enough to generate new avenues of
derived inclusive fitness theory, as for example David Haig’s genomic
imprinting theory. By the way, also Dave Queller and Steve Frank have
always argued that both types of models are useful and complementary.
Changed uncritical to “immediate”.
Line 114. Remove the value-laden word like ‘presciently’
This is a word in praise of Okasha, who I think was prescient and the first to
try to move this from an either/or argument into an “and” discussion. If more
had taken his recommendations, I likely would not be writing this comment at
all!
Line. 118-121. NTW did not pioneer simulation modelling and simulation
modelling is something else than formal mathematical modelling. Formal
mathematics provides first principle theory such as Hamilton’s rule and its
broadened version using the Price equation. Simulation models address
specific cases where multiple restrictive assumptions need to be made, and
where complexity exceeds what can be tracked analytically. As I tried to
explain in my general comments above, simulation approaches can be useful
but only if the assumptions about what phenotypes do are reasonable, and
they should never claim to demonstrate something truly general. Overselling
in that way was typical for the NTW paper and because their assumptions
were often wrong or irrelevant, it gained no followers. I do not understand
why the author is so adamant to defend this paper as some kind of a ‘flagship
case’. It detracts from the merits of his own models, which are more realistic
and where he is willing to be specific about assumptions and about matches
with general theory.
I appreciate (and agree!) that my papers are better attempts at trying to
understand a phenomenon rather than to bash an entire field of study.
Although I feel NTW is still the flagship work for arguing why one needs to
model cooperation using a different methodology I am fine with not giving
them credit for it. I deleted that clause.
Line 124-125. ‘could consider’. Yes, but again the power issue is
fundamentally different for lineages where colonies have facultative altruism
versus those that have obligate altruism. You should make explicit that your
point is about the former, not the latter type of social systems, and cite the
well-known review by Beekman and Ratnieks to build any new argument on
that synthesis. In fact it turns out that not only this first point, but also the
following points 2-6 are about social systems with facultative altruism (see my
last general comment above).
I did not mean to imply that I am the first person to ever think of any of the
issues I raise. It is that they need more attention in my opinion. The B&R
paper is a good one to cite, which I do now.
Line 136. ‘can easily select’ …. As far as I am aware there is no evidence for
this to be ‘easy’ and to my knowledge there are no empirical data showing
that selection for genetic diversity has produced consistent group adaptations
in cooperative breeders. Reference 41 reports patterns across empirical
studies but without addressing whether drifting ‘workers’ are potential
reproducers or not. The only exceptions of unambiguous group adaptations
owing to higher (chimeric) genetic diversity within groups appear to have
happened after the point of no return to superorganismality had been passed.
I.e., honeybee and leaf-cutting ant colonies deal better with disease when
they have more patrilines and costly obligate multiple queen mating is
therefore a functional adaptation. Whether drifting workers can be considered
to be a group adaptation remains to be proven and seems unlikely from a
general theoretical perspective – these phenomena are merely effects of
something else that could easily not have a functional adaptive significance
(see Williams, 1966, for an important discussion about function and effect).
Referring to ‘indirect reciprocity’ is unhelpful if you do not add a few lines of
explanation of how that concept connects to what this essay is about.
This refers to a simulation model, which shows that drifting and lowered
relatedness do not require unusual or extreme conditions in order to spread
through a population. I have clarified this to state that is a theoretical
prediction. However, it is supported by how often low-relatedness societies
evolve and the taxonomic commonness of drifting. I also explained more
what is meant by indirect reciprocity in this case.
Line 140-141. The monogamy hypothesis has always emphasized life-time
(obligate) unmatedness, not obligate sterility, which requires diploidy to be an
automatic consequence of unmatedness.
The argument is relevant independent of whether or not workers can produce
male eggs or no eggs at all. I am questioning here the pronouncement that
this feature is irreversible. To turn the tables, how does the reviewer know
that there is no way to reverse sterility? Show me the experiment.
Line 144-146. This is a hand-waving statement. The monogamy hypothesis
predicts (both in the early reviews and more explicitly in the later ones, which
you should cite if you aim to be balanced) that such reversals should not
have happened. That prediction has been consistent with all available
evidence so far (see Boomsma & Gawne 2018 and Smith et al. 2018 for
updates), so a statement like this is misleading unless you can cite empirical
papers that have provided evidence to the contrary. A more productive
approach would be to make sure you acknowledge that the ‘monogamy
window’ hypothesis for major transitions to caste societies is something else
than facilitating monogamy in cooperative breeders (see my general
comments) – and focus on the latter.
It is hand waving on both sides of this question. Which, of course, makes it
attractive for direct investigation!
Line 147. The monogamy (window) hypothesis is about how facultative
altruism can be replaced by obligate altruism, not about cooperation.
To me, that just is an added level of cooperation.
Line 148-150. Yes, it should work both ways, but only if relatedness is a true
variable as in cooperatively breeding vertebrates, Polistes wasps, halictid
bees etc. Once more, the core idea of the monogamy hypothesis is that strict
full-sibling relatedness makes the relatedness terms cancel.
However, they no longer cancel once you have multiple parents!
That was apparently a necessary condition for major irreversible transitions to
higher organismal complexity (both colonial superorganismality and obligate
multicellular organismality), but not a sufficient one (the Leggett et al. paper –
your ref 7 – also makes this point). Only long-term consistent b>c benefits will
forge major irreversible transitions after the necessary condition is fulfilled
and that is a tall order. This entire point 3 is fine if you make explicit it is about
cooperative breeders only (just like the other 5 points).
Obvious by now that I do not agree here!
In such ‘societies’ monogamy is never strict. References 4 and 8 are perfectly
up front about that. Reference 3 was not, but you cannot hold that against the
monogamy hypothesis. It is easy to plot the major irreversible transitions on
the Hughes et al (2008) phylogeny (the base of the corbiculate bees, the
base of the higher termites, the base of the vespine wasps). What you say
here applies basal to those transitions, not beyond them – the later
monogamy reviews have been very explicit about that, but that logic is also in
the 2007 and 2009 versions. Irreversibility of transitions to coloniality where
all individuals belong to a complementary caste for life (Wheeler
superorganismality) is not just an assumption, it is consistent with all
comparative data both for superorganismality and obligate multicellularity (cf
Smith et al. Nature E&E 2018, Fisher et al. Current Biology 2013, Boomsma
& Gawne, 2018).
What is and is not a multicellular organism is getting more nuanced every day
and not all MET’s required genetic relatedness (e.g., mitochondria and
chloroplasts symbioses with other cells).
Line 151-156. Yes, Polistes colonies and human groups are societies, albeit
very different ones because we have cumulative culture driving our social
evolution. So again this is a ‘society’ argument, but it has no bearing on the
strict type of monogamy window hypothesized to represent a necessary
condition for the emergence of obligate altruism in superorganisms (which no
longer are societies of totipotent individuals). Once more, it would be useful if
you somehow made these distinctions explicit when you intend this essay to
be a way forward.
That distinction is obvious throughout the comment and need not be made in
every other paragraph!
Line 158. ‘sometimes’? Sibling competition within groups is generally and
principally important as Hamilton and May (1977), Steve Frank (JEB 2012),
Stu West & Ido Pen, and Leggett et al. (your ref 7) have amply documented.
The group benefits you have in mind here are just the Hamiltonian b>c
values. Also your point 5 is about family groups before permanent castes
evolve.
Yes, sometimes as opposed to never or always. The negative consequences
of living together with close kin have not always received as much attention
as the positive.
Line 162. And so is point 6. The Riehl work is very interesting, but not as a
challenge of the monogamy hypothesis for altruism driven by indirect fitness
benefits, because two key conditions do not apply: 1. ‘helpers’ gain no
inclusive fitness – they just hang around to receive prolonged parental
investment. 2. These greater anis are not family groups where altruism could
have evolved.
Yes, but monogamy (or not) is quite important in determining how inbreeding
effects could obviate Hamilton’s rule predictions.
Line 168-172. The final quote is nice, but should in my opinion refer to the
need to test both the assumptions and the predictions of any model used to
better understand social evolution. It has no specific bearing on ecology and
group-level benefits, which are fully covered by Hamilton’s rule as the series
of Steve Frank papers in JEB (2011-2013) amply document. Does it have
bearings on genetics? Yes, quite possibly so, but remember Hamilton’s rule
is about genetics as well. If you want to make the genetics more explicit that
can be useful, but it will always imply making restrictive assumptions that the
Price equation (general inclusive fitness) approach does not need to make. If
you keep adding special assumptions in order to gain ‘realism’, you may end
up with a model that is very precise about a scenario that may never apply in
nature. See my general comments and the Queller quote given above on how
generality and precision of models trade-off. Both approaches are valuable
when assumptions about individual and colony phenotypes are reasonable –
and then they are complementary ways towards understanding. Models with
inappropriate or unspecified assumptions are not useful. I think that should be
a major condition for making your ‘verify’ by modelling credible, but the final
arbiter of course remains what the empirical data show.
The counter argument is that general does not equal universal. General rules
are fine, and Hamilton’s rule is one of the best, but there are clear instances
where rb – c > 0 fails to adequately describe what you have in nature. It is
important to know where and when the general is contravened by the
specific.
