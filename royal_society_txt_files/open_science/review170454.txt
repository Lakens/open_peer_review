In the study the spatial patterns of sequential colonizations of the available bark area within
fallen trees is studied for the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus. In I. typographus the male
initiates the colonization by boring through the bark and releasing an aggregation pheromone
which attracts females as well as other males that also may colonize the same tree. When
attacking living trees, which have a strong defense, the resulting mass attack is necessary for
overcoming tree defenses. But there is also a trade-off between colonization density and
reproductive success as a result of intraspecific competition between the females (affecting the
length of maternal galleries and thus the number of laid eggs) and the larvae (as a result of
overexploitation of the phloem). Thus, it is interesting to understand the choices made by
attracted males: where they chose to bore into the bark in relation to already established males
and how this pattern changes with increasing colonization density.
This is an interesting study that generally is well described and written. It is the first to document
what happens over time and not only the final result of colonization. The spatial patterns are
analyzed in detail with advanced statistical methods. Here I have to admit that I am not able to
evaluate if the used statistics are the most appropriate but it seems to be thoroughly done. Thus,
this study definitively merits publication after some revision.
Some more important comments:
The study demonstrates an average minimum distance between the holes of male colonizers of
about 5 cm (inhibition radius 2.5 cm). This is interpreted as safeguarding of resourced by the
initial colonizers. But, this safeguarded area only partly covers the area used for the development
of maternal galleries (in the literature there are information about maternal gallery lengths at
different densities) and larval galleries. In other words, there will still be intense intraspecific
competition despite this mechanism. This should be mentioned in the discussion.
In the Discussion it is argued that this inhibition distance results in a maximum brood
productivity per tree and thus should be adaptive. But, what is important is the reproductive
success (i.e. offspring per parent, for I. typographus usually expressed as daughters per mother
or maternal gallery) and not offspring production per m2 bark. The relationship between
maternal gallery density and reproductive success has been demonstrated to be exponential
negative. Thus, even at rather low colonization densities there is such a negative relationship. At
least as long as the defense (which is generally weak for fallen trees) of the tree is overcome.
In the Discussion it is also argued that on fallen trees there is no penalty for “pioneering” and no
reward as also the “followers” will benefit from equal space. This could be discussed a little more
because it may not be true under all circumstances. Regarding the penalty also wind-felled trees
(with some root contact) may have some defense and colonization attempts may be unsuccessful
(observed as maternal galleries with resin and no larval galleries). Especially in a situation with a
low beetle pressure (e.g. when there is a large surplus of wind-felled trees). Regarding the
followers, one disadvantage could be that the pioneer maternal galleries, and larval galleries,
may already have started to develop (and thus occupy resources) when the follower colonize.
This may be more or less important depending on how extended over time the colonization is.
Specific comments:
L 27-28: See comments below about this statement.
L 45: “relies on high numbers of insects” Not necessarily, if colonizing a host with weak defenses.
L 46: “and thus entails high risk… I suggest that you discuss this in a separate sentence.

L 116-117: ”every 3-4 days” do not correspond to Figure 1a. Maybe you mean on average.
L 153-154: Were also the undersides of the stems included in the study or only the upper and
sides?
L 161-162: I guess this means that part of the bark area was excluded because of lack of holes
(maybe the underside of the log or).
L 212 (and later): Maybe you should write (n = 13) instead of just (13) to make it easier for the
reader.
L 243-244: Hard for me to understand. Above you have stated that there is a linear relationship
between segment area and convex hull area: I interpret this as about the same proportion of the
segment areas constitute the convex hull areas. Then you state that the final number of holes is
not related to segment area (ie different densities of holes for different segments). But, if this is
true how can convex hull area be related to final number of holes? Probably I have
misunderstood something here?
L 415: Is it really an ambiguity? Your explanation above about the necessity of clustered attacks
on living trees to overcome defenses seems logical. Maybe rephrase the last sentence to
something like more studies are needed to compare trees with low and high defenses.
L 424: Although wind-felled trees may still have some defenses even though the risk is much less
compared with attacking standing trees. Because you baited the trees with pheromones this risk
was not tested in the experiment (and it was not your purpose with the experiment so I am not
criticizing here). The risk of unsuccessful attack should be greatest when populations are low and
when a large surplus of breeding material.
L 424-426: This is an important statement and I do not agree. The temporal difference between the
pioneer and the followers could be important. Depending on how large this difference is, the
maternal galleries, and larval galleries, may already have occupied some space when the
additional colonizer arrive. Gallery systems occupy a considerably larger safeguarded space than
the “inhibition” distance create.
L 433-436: This is a problematic statement. First you need to clarify what you mean with
“maximum brood productivity per tree”. The relevant measure in this context should be
reproductive success, or ratio of increase, (ie offspring produced per parent beetle) and not
number of offspring produced per tree or m2 bark. The reproductive success is well known to
have strong exponential negative relationship with colonization density both from laboratory
studies (see Anderbtrandt) and field studies (see eg Faccoli and Bernardinelli that you refer to).
This means that there is a large difference in reproductive success also within the range of
colonization densities in your study (0.4 – 1.2 holes per m2).
L 473-475: See comments above.
L 732: Fig. 6: The grey dots are really hard to see in the figure.

L 23 – 25 and figure S1: I do not understand this, seems that some text is missing or? The 50 cm
area (where attacks are counted for removal of dispenser) is indicated by the lines at -0.5 and

And what do the circles indicate? (Possibly the area included in the test of Influence of
pheromones on spatial pattern).

This study examines the sequential settlement process of animals (bark beetles in this case) into
an initially unoccupied habitat. I really like the topic, the data, and the analyses (for the most
part). The part that I feel needs more work prior to publication is the theoretical context and
explicit hypothesis testing. In the current state, the study is largely descriptive. The title and
keywords have behavioral ecology words that are hardly mentioned in the text except to say that
cheating isn't really relevant to this study system. I don't think that data are provided to address
the first sentence of the abstract. Hypothesis testing will make this paper of broader interest to
researchers of other study systems. At the other end, some additional information pertinent to
bark beetles and their host trees could be added. Overall, I think this study has huge potential
that might not even all fit in one paper. I hope the authors will be able to revise to make testable
predictions and perhaps do some new analyses. I really look forward to its publication.
Hypotheses
I suggest framing the data around alternative hypotheses in the Introduction:
• Based on the biology of the system, with aggregation pheromones, we might expect
mechanistically that settlement on a tree might be aggregated as has been observed for a tree-
killing species. Functionally, local aggregation could be advantageous for mate attraction, which
not made explicit in this system (the implication was that it was just foraging). There is quite a
literature on conspecific attraction that has some pertinence.
• There have been proposed strategies for settlement in cases such as this. One of these is Stamps
& Krishnan 1990. Am Nat. This could also predict initially aggregated settlement that may
become regular but could depend on knowledge of the final settlement density.
• The settlement in this study is not completely sequential, with a lot of individuals settling
simultaneously on some days. Attention to the implications of this for settlement patterns is
appropriate. Given simultaneous settlement, the best strategy for settlement might be random, as
proposed at a different scale by Elkin & Reid 2010 Oikos.
• The ideal free distribution predicts that individuals settling at the same time gain similar
resources. This could be investigated by comparing nearest neighbor distances with random on a
daily basis. Bark roughness could provide an a priori metric of habitat quality, so that one could
predict a pattern of settlement with respect to roughness. The observation that the relative
proportion of beetles on rough and smooth bark remained constant could support the IFD.
These hypotheses (and any others) make predictions that can be explicitly tested with the data
and provide an organizing framework. Currently, the methods of spatial analyses just describe a
list of analyses without saying what they will tell us. For example, if incoming beetles want to
settle next to others, we would expect that the initial distribution should be aggregated.
Aggregation was not explicitly tested in this study, but the finding of randomness rejects that
hypothesis; this non-significance is a real result (at various places, non-significant results are
often dismissed with no accompanying statistics, indicating that the focus is on finding patterns
5
rather than testing hypotheses, e.g. authors' line 129, 220, 293). The analyses related to the
artificial pheromone lures could also inform the aggregation process. As another testable
prediction, the authors could look at how nearest neighbor distances decline as settlement
continues (see Stamps & Krishnan 1990). Given the analysis tools the authors have used, these
predictions can be robustly tested with these data and the current or additional analyses. Some
analyses currently in the supplementary data may belong better in the main paper (e.g. S11 and
S12).
In these analyses, the authors should be careful about how to interpret simultaneous settlement,
as individuals might not be aware of concurrent settlers as noted above.
Bark beetle biology
Although the current ms is focused on the empirical patterns, it could still use some more
information about the study system. In the methods, a brief overview of the system should
include the exact number of trees, their sizes, their distance from each other, and their exposure
to sun (which can determine whether beetles settle on top, on the sides or underneath the log -
how were holes mapped on the undersides?). In their discussion of differences in 'receptivity' of
habitat (a better non-action adjective should be used), the authors do not consider the tree traits
that include diameter, nutrition and defenses that are known for these trees from previous
studies and could explain differences among segments. There is quite a bit of variation in final
settlement densities shown in Fig 4a that is not explained. At the very least, it would be
interesting to know if settlement patterns on different segments on the same tree are more similar
to each other than for segments on other trees. The assumption that all segments are
independent, even for those on the same tree, is questionable but perhaps justifiable if the scale of
interest is really local and not concerned with whether settlement densities can be explained by
some metric of habitat quality (which seems a really big missed opportunity - perhaps another
paper?).
Other points
• "Safeguarding" is not appropriate for this system, as established settlers can't make prospective
settlers do anything. The decision belongs entirely to the subsequent settlers, as the authors note
on their line 426. The title needs to be completely changed.
• The last line of the abstract is not well founded. I think the final densities were determined by
population size, while this study provided no data on maximal brood productivity per tree
(which is not the appropriate metric when discussing individual behavior).
• The word 'experiment' is not appropriate to this study, as the manipulations were unrelated to
the questions here.
• I hope the manuscript will be copy-edited to improve some awkward word choice throughout
the manuscript.
• I find it a bit problematic that the different segments within a tree are considered independent
even though the distance between them is less than the segment lengths, but I'm not sure if that's
a big issue here.
• I don't see the value of provided absolute numbers per segment given the differences in their
area (e.g. Fig 2 a,c).
• The small interruption in the settling sequence, giving two colonization periods, does not seem
important to me. Weather will always be important, and varies not just in temperature, which
the authors considered, but also wind, rain and barometric pressure. Unless the interruption has
an influence on the outcomes of hypotheses, I would omit that part which will free up space for
other tests. (One idea though: settlers after the interruption may have better information about
the location of other beetles than those settling in successive days.)
• Pheromones change as males attract more mates. I'm curious about whether beetles settle
farther away from beetles that have been there longer, given that 'older' settlers will be occupying
more space than early ones.

This manuscript studied the spatiotemperal pattern of aggregation in a bark beetle that settles on
dead wood. I think the paper presents some interesting spatial patterns. I agree with the authors
that more work needs to be done on the bark beetles which attack dead wood, rather than live
wood.
I found the title a bit misleading. ’Cheaters’ implies that there are individuals that don’t
contribute yet gain the advantages of colonisation, but the present project isn’t setup to
investigate that question. ‘Safeguard’ also implies a more active deterrence strategy on the part
of the ‘defenders’. But it could simply be the case that arriving beetles avoid competition by
settling between occupied sites.
Ln 63: “Provides no collective gain”. I don’t think this has been clearly established. There are
several potential benefits to aggregation such as mate attraction, predator dilution, and wood
conditioning by the symbiotic fungus vectored by bark beetles. Any or several of these would
provide a ‘reason’ for bark beetles to aggregate beyond mere tree killing.
See, for example: Aukema, B. H., & Raffa, K. F. (2004). Does aggregation benefit bark beetles by
diluting predation? Links between a group-colonisation strategy and the absence of emergent
multiple predator effects. Ecological Entomology, 29(2), 129-138.
I’m not convinced that synthetic pheromone had no impact on the results. The lure could attract a
different subset of beetles than would normally be expected. For example, perhaps some beetles
avoid highly populated trees (ex. If they have greater fat reserves and can fly further to better
resources). If this were the case, the synthetic lure could attract lower condition beetles, and that
might in turn effect their behaviour. The authors claim the pattern is the same as in ‘ whole trees
without lures’.. why then, were the lure treatments used at all? At the least, it is important for the
authors to justify their use of a lure (rather than relying on natural attacks).
The two log segments are not independent. Bark beetles likely locate food through a combination
of olfactory and visual cues. Decisions made about whether or not to land, and about where to
land are unlikely to consider the log as distinct segments. Also , pheromones emanating from
7
one side could effect the behaviour of beetles on the other side. The comparison to a natural
aggregation is re-assuring, but the sample size is very low (3).

Associate Editor's comments:
Comments to the Author:
I have now received three thoughtful reviews of your manuscript. All of the reviewers agree that
this is an interesting manuscript with sophisticated methods and asks an interesting question.
However, all reviewers raise similar concerns with the the study, and I find myself in agreement
with their concerns. Specifically, I agree that there are no data that would support evidence of
“cheating” and “safeguarding” in the beetles, and thus the title and abstract are misleading.
9
Related to this, all the reviewers point out that the measure of “success” implied in the
manuscript is not relevant to individuals’ behavioural decisions, which is the topic under study
(see the reviewers' comments for more details). There thus seems to be a mismatch between the
aim of the paper and the data that were collected in this regard. In addition, I agree with reviewer
2 that an hypothesis-testing framework would improve the manuscript, making some
complicated analyses easier to follow. That isn’t to say that descriptive studies are not
worthwhile, but that, in this case at least, a more focussed presentation would be helpful for the
reader. Finally, all reviewers highlighted that the tree segments are not independent, and would
recommend that they should not be treated as such in this study, for the reasons outlined by
reviewer 3.

In the study the spatial patterns of sequential colonizations of the available bark area within
fallen trees is studied for the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus. In I. typographus the male
initiates the colonization by boring through the bark and releasing an aggregation pheromone
which attracts females as well as other males that also may colonize the same tree. When
attacking living trees, which have a strong defense, the resulting mass attack is necessary for
overcoming tree defenses. But there is also a trade-off between colonization density and
reproductive success as a result of intraspecific competition between the females (affecting the
length of maternal galleries and thus the number of laid eggs) and the larvae (as a result of
overexploitation of the phloem). Thus, it is interesting to understand the choices made by
attracted males: where they chose to bore into the bark in relation to already established males
and how this pattern changes with increasing colonization density.
This is an interesting study that generally is well described and written. It is the first to document
what happens over time and not only the final result of colonization. The spatial patterns are
analyzed in detail with advanced statistical methods. Here I have to admit that I am not able to
evaluate if the used statistics are the most appropriate but it seems to be thoroughly done. Thus,
this study definitively merits publication after some revision.
Some more important comments:
The study demonstrates an average minimum distance between the holes of male colonizers of
about 5 cm (inhibition radius 2.5 cm). This is interpreted as safeguarding of resourced by the
initial colonizers. But, this safeguarded area only partly covers the area used for the development
of maternal galleries (in the literature there are information about maternal gallery lengths at
different densities) and larval galleries. In other words, there will still be intense intraspecific
competition despite this mechanism. This should be mentioned in the discussion.
In the Discussion it is argued that this inhibition distance results in a maximum brood
productivity per tree and thus should be adaptive. But, what is important is the reproductive
success (i.e. offspring per parent, for I. typographus usually expressed as daughters per mother
or maternal gallery) and not offspring production per m2 bark. The relationship between
maternal gallery density and reproductive success has been demonstrated to be exponential
negative. Thus, even at rather low colonization densities there is such a negative relationship. At
least as long as the defense (which is generally weak for fallen trees) of the tree is overcome.
In the Discussion it is also argued that on fallen trees there is no penalty for “pioneering” and no
reward as also the “followers” will benefit from equal space. This could be discussed a little more
because it may not be true under all circumstances. Regarding the penalty also wind-felled trees
(with some root contact) may have some defense and colonization attempts may be unsuccessful
10
(observed as maternal galleries with resin and no larval galleries). Especially in a situation with a
low beetle pressure (e.g. when there is a large surplus of wind-felled trees). Regarding the
followers, one disadvantage could be that the pioneer maternal galleries, and larval galleries,
may already have started to develop (and thus occupy resources) when the follower colonize.
This may be more or less important depending on how extended over time the colonization is.

become regular but could depend on knowledge of the final settlement density.
• The settlement in this study is not completely sequential, with a lot of individuals settling
simultaneously on some days. Attention to the implications of this for settlement patterns is
appropriate. Given simultaneous settlement, the best strategy for settlement might be random, as
proposed at a different scale by Elkin & Reid 2010 Oikos.
• The ideal free distribution predicts that individuals settling at the same time gain similar
resources. This could be investigated by comparing nearest neighbor distances with random on a
daily basis. Bark roughness could provide an a priori metric of habitat quality, so that one could
predict a pattern of settlement with respect to roughness. The observation that the relative
proportion of beetles on rough and smooth bark remained constant could support the IFD.
These hypotheses (and any others) make predictions that can be explicitly tested with the data
and provide an organizing framework. Currently, the methods of spatial analyses just describe a
list of analyses without saying what they will tell us. For example, if incoming beetles want to
settle next to others, we would expect that the initial distribution should be aggregated.
Aggregation was not explicitly tested in this study, but the finding of randomness rejects that
hypothesis; this non-significance is a real result (at various places, non-significant results are
often dismissed with no accompanying statistics, indicating that the focus is on finding patterns
rather than testing hypotheses, e.g. authors' line 129, 220, 293). The analyses related to the
artificial pheromone lures could also inform the aggregation process. As another testable
prediction, the authors could look at how nearest neighbor distances decline as settlement
continues (see Stamps & Krishnan 1990). Given the analysis tools the authors have used, these
predictions can be robustly tested with these data and the current or additional analyses. Some
analyses currently in the supplementary data may belong better in the main paper (e.g. S11 and
S12).
In these analyses, the authors should be careful about how to interpret simultaneous settlement,
as individuals might not be aware of concurrent settlers as noted above.

Although the current ms is focused on the empirical patterns, it could still use some more
information about the study system. In the methods, a brief overview of the system should
include the exact number of trees, their sizes, their distance from each other, and their exposure
to sun (which can determine whether beetles settle on top, on the sides or underneath the log -
how were holes mapped on the undersides?). In their discussion of differences in 'receptivity' of
habitat (a better non-action adjective should be used), the authors do not consider the tree traits
that include diameter, nutrition and defenses that are known for these trees from previous
studies and could explain differences among segments. There is quite a bit of variation in final
settlement densities shown in Fig 4a that is not explained. At the very least, it would be
interesting to know if settlement patterns on different segments on the same tree are more similar
to each other than for segments on other trees. The assumption that all segments are
independent, even for those on the same tree, is questionable but perhaps justifiable if the scale of
interest is really local and not concerned with whether settlement densities can be explained by
some metric of habitat quality (which seems a really big missed opportunity - perhaps another
paper?).
Other points
• "Safeguarding" is not appropriate for this system, as established settlers can't make prospective
settlers do anything. The decision belongs entirely to the subsequent settlers, as the authors note
on their line 426. The title needs to be completely changed.
• The last line of the abstract is not well founded. I think the final densities were determined by
population size, while this study provided no data on maximal brood productivity per tree
(which is not the appropriate metric when discussing individual behavior).
• The word 'experiment' is not appropriate to this study, as the manipulations were unrelated to
the questions here.
• I hope the manuscript will be copy-edited to improve some awkward word choice throughout
the manuscript.
• I find it a bit problematic that the different segments within a tree are considered independent
even though the distance between them is less than the segment lengths, but I'm not sure if that's
a big issue here.
• I don't see the value of provided absolute numbers per segment given the differences in their
area (e.g. Fig 2 a,c).
• The small interruption in the settling sequence, giving two colonization periods, does not seem
important to me. Weather will always be important, and varies not just in temperature, which
the authors considered, but also wind, rain and barometric pressure. Unless the interruption has
an influence on the outcomes of hypotheses, I would omit that part which will free up space for
other tests. (One idea though: settlers after the interruption may have better information about
the location of other beetles than those settling in successive days.)
• Pheromones change as males attract more mates. I'm curious about whether beetles settle
farther away from beetles that have been there longer, given that 'older' settlers will be occupying
more space than early ones.

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript studied the spatiotemperal pattern of aggregation in a bark beetle that settles on
dead wood. I think the paper presents some interesting spatial patterns. I agree with the authors
that more work needs to be done on the bark beetles which attack dead wood, rather than live
wood.
I found the title a bit misleading. ’Cheaters’ implies that there are individuals that don’t
contribute yet gain the advantages of colonisation, but the present project isn’t setup to
investigate that question. ‘Safeguard’ also implies a more active deterrence strategy on the part
of the ‘defenders’. But it could simply be the case that arriving beetles avoid competition by
settling between occupied sites.
13
Ln 63: “Provides no collective gain”. I don’t think this has been clearly established. There are
several potential benefits to aggregation such as mate attraction, predator dilution, and wood
conditioning by the symbiotic fungus vectored by bark beetles. Any or several of these would
provide a ‘reason’ for bark beetles to aggregate beyond mere tree killing.
See, for example: Aukema, B. H., & Raffa, K. F. (2004). Does aggregation benefit bark beetles by
diluting predation? Links between a group-colonisation strategy and the absence of emergent
multiple predator effects. Ecological Entomology, 29(2), 129-138.
I’m not convinced that synthetic pheromone had no impact on the results. The lure could attract a
different subset of beetles than would normally be expected. For example, perhaps some beetles
avoid highly populated trees (ex. If they have greater fat reserves and can fly further to better
resources). If this were the case, the synthetic lure could attract lower condition beetles, and that
might in turn effect their behaviour. The authors claim the pattern is the same as in ‘ whole trees
without lures’.. why then, were the lure treatments used at all? At the least, it is important for the
authors to justify their use of a lure (rather than relying on natural attacks).
The two log segments are not independent. Bark beetles likely locate food through a combination
of olfactory and visual cues. Decisions made about whether or not to land, and about where to
land are unlikely to consider the log as distinct segments. Also , pheromones emanating from
one side could effect the behaviour of beetles on the other side. The comparison to a natural
aggregation is re-assuring, but the sample size is very low (3).

This manuscript describes the dynamics of bark beetle attacks on trees that have very
low levels of chemical defenses, with the expectation that the behavior and attack dynamics will
differ from beetle attacks on highly defended trees. The authors were able to show that, indeed,
beetles behave quite differently on defenseless host species, with the goal not of killing the tree,
but to establish a bore hole with adequate space for a large egg gallery. In trees in which attacks
led to high densities of holes, a regular distribution was observed, as the authors expected.
Data analyses were thorough and the analyses led convincingly to the conclusion of a
regular distribution. While a naturalist might suppose that this was the expected result, this
paper provides the data to confirm the expectation.
Figure 2b shows a striking difference in the density of holes on rough versus smooth
bark. The authors offered no explanation in Results, and in Discussion they mention “random,
non-oriented walks on the hosts.” A more compelling explanation comes from an experimental
study which tested the ability of bark beetles to cling to vertical surfaces of either smooth or
rough bark, and clearly demonstrated that a beetle placed on smooth bark fell off quickly, but the
same beetle placed on rough bark on the same tree showed the normal degree of agility:

bark beetle attack: resurrecting a ‘slippery’ hypothesis. Functional Ecology:
doi: 10.1111/1365-2435.12228
Minor Comments:
The authors use the word “receptivity” to describe the level of tree’s defenses, but a more
descriptive and appropriate word would be “resistance or susceptibility.” Highly defended trees
are resistant, trees with low levels of defenses are susceptible.
The authors use the phrase “global intrinsic receptivity” when they consider whether defenses
change with height along the bole of the tree. “Global” does not seem appropriate when
discussing variation in one tree. One could discuss whether resin pressure or chemical defenses
or resistance or susceptibility varied with height above the ground.

The manuscript describes a detailed study following Ips typographus attack sequence and
distribution on wind thrown trees. The results are interpreted through a number of statistical
methods, most of which I cannot comment on. My review therefore focuses on the presentation
and interpretation of the results obtained.
The authors have addressed a number of comments provided by three reviewers of the initial
submission. In some cases they have opted to stick with their initial approach in spite of reviewer
comments. In particular, the treatment of the two observation segments on a single tree as
independent is something I have difficulty with. I would be much more comfortable if these were
treated as nested within the tree, as each tree may vary in attractiveness to the beetles depending
on their semiochemical constituents.
Otherwise, I have commented throughout the adobe manuscript on the items I feel could use
further explanation or re-wording. (Appendix B)

This study thoroughly analyzes temporal and spatial patterns of beetle settlement with a variety
of statistical approaches. This may be one of the most comprehensive sets of analyses of
settlement behavior, a question that has not been often addressed lately. My concern is that the
analyses of these data dominate the paper while the ecology is relatively thin.
16
Overall, I accept the statistical methods are done correctly but that is partly based on the sheer
number of them that are overwhelming at times. Although I quibble with the assumption that all
bark segments are independent (the authors have evidence to the contrary, i.e. that segments of
the same tree are more similar to each other than to segments), I don't think this is critical for the
current study. The purpose of some of the analyses is unclear. For example, the first sentence of
the dclf test (authors' line 193) says it "is a Monte Carlo test" of what?... where T is "a summary
function" vague and "rmax is a chosen upper limit" of what? Similarly, the last sentence of this
section (starting L. 206) is vague as to its purpose regarding "general spatial structure". I'm not
clear on why differences in 'receptivity' among segments is pertinent to the central question,
given that the analysis focuses within segments (hence the independence of segments). In
general, the first section of the Results is fancy descriptive analyses that are not linked well to the
central question.
My biggest concern remains with the premise of the study. The authors did not make a
compelling case that the settlement dynamics of tree-killing beetles are well known but those
inhabiting weakened trees are not. Similar numbers of citations are given for both cases. The
pattern for tree-killers hinges on one study of mountain pine beetles (Raffa and Berryman 1983)
where it appears that settlement is initially aggregated and then become uniform (Line 429).
Safranyik and Vithayasai (1971) found that MPB settlement was unaffected by the presence of
neighboring beetles, which does not suggest aggregation behavior. The current study finds a
different temporal settlement pattern than did Raffa & Berryman, but the comparison is between
just two studies so it is difficult to make much inference. It could well be that it's related to
differences in tree defenses, as the authors suggest, but it could be due to any number of other
differences between the two species and two studies. To make the point that Ips typographus in
this study were initially random and then aggregated, Fig. 4 alone seems sufficient.
The hypothesis proposed at the end of the Introduction is very non-committal: that the absence of
consistent (?) defenses "would influence" settlement - in what way?? Other approaches to
settlement strategies are mentioned in the Discussion, e.g. Stamps and Krishnan (line 453)
without any actual discussion - why might Ips typographus not use a neighbor rule? The
mention of the Ideal Free Distribution (line 497) with respect to bark roughness is not integrated
with the other results: if beetles are paying attention to the local densities between rough and
smooth, what are the implications for overall settlement patterns? Still other strategies could be
plausible. I think beetles could settle to be evenly distributed to maximize space if the final
densities are unpredictable as they might be in undefended trees. This hypothesis makes the
same prediction that beetles should fully use the available space from the start, which the authors
use just to argue against aggregated settlement. I still think that much more hypothesis testing
can be done with this data set and with these authors' computational skills that would make this
study of greater interest to ecologists in general.
However, maybe these aren't the authors to run with testing various settlement strategies from a
behavioural ecology perspective. There is definitely value in the current work in terms of
analysis methods and perhaps that's sufficient for this journal.

Dear authors,
The reviewers provide some convergent, helpful suggestions to improve with the clarity of the
manuscript. In general, these should be easy to address. However, I agree with the reviewers
that, given these data, it would be better to analyse the same-tree segments as non-independent
data points. In addition, reviewer 3 raises a concern about the premise of the manuscript as it is
written. The manuscript is very technical, which is not a problem per se, but the argument is
made that this focus detracts from the ecology of the process that is being described by the
statistical approach. The reviewer makes some suggestions for how to address this.

However (and this has also been made more explicit in l. 458-463), even though the
inhibition radius is 2.5 cm, an establishment density corresponding to this radius was

beginning, and it increases for a while with the number of attacks regardless of the size
of the segment, as shown in our simulations (Appendix S8, Supporting Information).
However, as the infestation proceeds, Ahull reaches a maximum value regardless of any
increase in the number of attacks. As these latter attacks occur WITHIN the patch, they
no longer affect the value of Ahull while they decrease the quality of the linear
relationship (value of R2 drops).

Reviewer 2
This study examines the sequential settlement process of animals (bark beetles in this
case) into an initially unoccupied habitat. I really like the topic, the data, and the
analyses (for the most part). The part that I feel needs more work prior to publication
is the theoretical context and explicit hypothesis testing. In the current state, the
study is largely descriptive. The title and keywords have behavioral ecology words that We thank the reviewer for these thoughtful comments. The title and abstract have been

beetles and their host trees could be added. Overall, I think this study has huge
potential that might not even all fit in one paper. I hope the authors will be able to
revise to make testable predictions and perhaps do some new analyses. I really look
forward to its publication.
Hypotheses We chose to develop the reasoning below in the Introduction, and to address points 1-5
I suggest framing the data around alternative hypotheses in the Introduction: from the reviewer in the Discussion.
<U+F0B7> Bark beetles use aggregation pheromones for group foraging, increasing their
individual chances of finding a host.
<U+F0B7> When a male has found a host, it releases pheromones that attract potential mates
but also other "spying" males. The final result is aggregation on the new host.
<U+F0B7> Apart from mass-foraging, bark beetles also use aggregation pheromones to
overcome tree defences when they attack living, defended hosts. In this case, they
tend to aggregate around the initial attacks (those of "pioneers"), and the
subsequent attacks gradually diffuse outward until a regular distribution is
reached.
<U+F0B7> Fallen trees have weak defences. When attacking this type of host, defences are
thus no longer a constraint (or a very weak one) for bark beetles, and the need to
concentrate the initial attacks on one spot to overcome local defences diminishes
or disappears. How this would affect colonization patterns is unknown.
<U+F0B7> Under these conditions, how should we reconsider the status (risks and benefits) of
the "pioneers"?

expect mechanistically that settlement on a tree might be aggregated as has been
observed for a tree-killing species. Functionally, local aggregation could be
advantageous for mate attraction, which not made explicit in this system (the
implication was that it was just foraging). There is quite a literature on conspecific
attraction that has some pertinence.

"In these analyses, the authors should be careful about how to interpret simultaneous

thank the reviewer for this remark. Actually, there is much simultaneous settlement, as
stated previously (37.7 to 87.4% of the beetles establish on the segments within
approximately five days with egg galleries progressing by ca. 4 mm/day and 1 to 2
eggs/day). We now fully consider simultaneous settlement in the Discussion.

their discussion of differences in 'receptivity' of habitat (a better non-action adjective
should be used), the authors do not consider the tree traits that include diameter,
nutrition and defenses that are known for these trees from previous studies and could
explain differences among segments. There is quite a bit of variation in final settlement
densities shown in Fig 4a that is not explained. At the very least, it would be interesting
to know if settlement patterns on different segments on the same tree are more
similar to each other than for segments on other trees. The assumption that all
segments are independent, even for those on the same tree, is questionable but
perhaps justifiable if the scale of interest is really local and not concerned with
whether settlement densities can be explained by some metric of habitat quality

15 chances of an individual to find a host and, when relevant, to overwhelm the defences of

45 16 healthy trees. When a male beetle finds a suitable host, it releases pheromones that attract
46
47 17 potential mates as well as other "spying" males, which results in aggregations on the new
48
49 18 host. To date, most studies have been concerned with the use of aggregation pheromones

3 21 or poorly defended hosts remains largely unknown. The spatio-temporal pattern of
4
5 22 resource colonization by the European eight-toothed spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus,
6
7 23 was quantified when weakly defended hosts (fallen trees) were attacked. In many of the
8
9
10 24 replicates, colonization began with the insects rapidly scattering over the available
11
12 25 surface and then randomly filling the gaps until a regular distribution was established,
13
14 26 which resulted in a constant decrease in nearest-neighbour distances to a minimum below
15
16 27 which new holes were not excavated. The scattered distribution of the first attacks
17
18
28 suggested that the trees were only weakly defended. A minimal theoretical distance of
19
20
21 29 2.5 cm to the earlier settlers (corresponding to a density of 3.13 attacks/dm²) was
22
23 30 calculated, but the attack density always remained lower, between 0.4 and 1.2 holes/dm²,
24
25 31 according to our observations.

32 Background
30
31 33 Conspecific, but not necessarily related, animals can forage collectively [1,2] using available
32
33 34 information produced by successful individuals [3]. Whilst this behaviour increases the
34
35 35 individual probability of success, it also raises largely unresolved questions regarding the
36
37
38 36 benefits and penalties of cooperation. Once resources have been located, their partitioning
39
40 37 could be equitable (which might lead to scramble competition at high densities) or biased to
41
42 38 the advantage of some colonizers, resulting in the eviction of some candidate settlers. Bark
43
44 39 beetles (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Scolytinae) provide multiple examples of such strategies
45
46
47
40 as well as the associated dilemmas. Many species forage collectively for the scarce,
48
49 41 unpredictable and ephemeral resources of weakened or dead trees [4–9]. At high population
50
51 42 densities, some even mass-attack and kill healthy trees [4,10–12]. In both cases, "pioneer"
52
53 43 individuals of either sex, depending on the species, find a host, initiate a gallery and
54
55 44 simultaneously emit aggregation pheromones that attract conspecifics of both sexes [4,12,13].
56
57
58 45 This collective behaviour relies on high numbers of insects being in the air to discover a host

3 46 and, if relevant, overcome its defences. Aggregation can also have other consequences, such
4
5 47 as outcompeting pathogenic fungi [14] or diluting the impact of natural enemies [15].
6
7
8 48 In all cases, attack densities above a certain limit negatively impact fitness [11,12,14,16–22].
9
10 49 Density-regulating mechanisms thus appear necessary for both mass-foraging and mass-
11
12
50 attack. Byers [23–25] suggested that Ips typographus, Ips paraconfusus Lanier, Tomicus
13
14
15 51 piniperda (L.), and Pityogenes chalcographus (L.) on fallen trees (FT) and Dendroctonus
16
17 52 brevicomis Le Conte on healthy trees (HT) solve or minimize density issues by regularly
18
19 53 spacing new attacks on their hosts. Hedden & Gara [26] and Safranyik and Vithayasai [27]
20
21 54 also recorded regular distributions of attack holes on Dendroctonus pseudotsugae (HT) and
22
23
24 55 Dendroctonus ponderosae (HT), respectively, and Byers [23] used computer simulations of
25
26 56 the attack holes by I. typographus on 1-m-long logs to estimate a 2.5 cm minimum allowed
27
28 57 distance (MAD) to the nearest neighbour. Interestingly, this MAD remained approximately
29
30 58 constant at the three attacks densities (0.90, 1.99, and 3.17 holes/dm²) observed in the field
31
32
59 that were used for calibrating the simulations, suggesting a fixed value for a given population
33
34
35 60 under different circumstances. Byers [23] also remarked that the uniform nature of the natural
36
37 61 attacks became more apparent at the highest density, i.e., as the mean distance to the nearest
38
39 62 neighbour approached the MAD.
40
41
42 63 However, most studies have been centred on "tree killing" species in the act of overwhelming
43
44 64 the defences of living, well-protected hosts (see, e.g., [11,28–30]), with relatively little
45
46
65 attention being paid to the constraints and opportunities related to collective establishment on
47
48
49 66 defenceless hosts (but see [6,11,14,23]). The collective and individual strengths and
50
51 67 weaknesses of these strategies have been discussed from various perspectives ranging from
52
53 68 implicit cooperation to outright competition between "pioneers" and "followers" that might
54
55 69 turn into "cheaters" [12,31].

3 70 When the notorious tree killer the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins,
4
5 71 attacks a new host, the pioneer beetles first aggregate locally on the trunk, and the subsequent
6
7 72 attack pattern on the same host gradually shifts towards a regular distribution [11]. The initial
8
9
10 73 concentration on the host is interpreted as a collective weakening of the local tree defences,
11
12 74 and the fact that this behaviour begins with a very local collective pressure on the attacked
13
14 75 trees is illustrated by the occurrence of "strip- or patch-killed" trees in which only local
15
16 76 portions of the phloem have been colonized [11].
17
18
19 77 Up to a certain threshold, a higher attack density on a living tree is mutually beneficial for the
20
21 78 pioneers and followers alike because it allows the local defences of a tree to be rapidly
22
23
24 79 overcome [11,28,29]; therefore, aggregating at high densities on weakened trees apparently
25
26 80 provides no collective gain. If landing on a defenceless host en masse is mainly or uniquely
27
28 81 the consequence of group foraging, we can expect that insects adopt different strategies than
29
30 82 concentrating on local tree defences. The objective of this study is to analyse the colonization
31
32
83 patterns of a facultative tree killer infesting poorly defended hosts. Our main hypothesis is
33
34
35 84 that the absence of consistent defences would influence the spatio-temporal deployment of the
36
37 85 attacking beetles. A secondary question is whether, under these conditions, the status (risks
38
39 86 and benefits) of the "pioneers" should be reconsidered. We addressed these issues by
40
41 87 monitoring the establishment of the European eight-toothed spruce bark beetle, Ips
42
43
44 88 typographus L., on weakened trees that were artificially or naturally felled.

90 Main observations on tree segments with pheromone lures
50
51 91 This study was initiated on 04/06/2013 and made use of a set of trees that had been uprooted
52
53 92 by being pulled down at various times in the year and protected by screens so that they could
54
55 93 be offered for colonization in a controlled fashion (see [7] for a complete description). The
56
57 94 experimental protocol was primarily designed to answer other questions, i.e., the temporal

3 95 changes in the nutritional value of windthrows for bark beetles [7] and the temporal changes
4
5 96 in windthrow defences [8]. This latter study showed that the trees lost most of their defences
6
7 97 with ca. 12 µg/g (dry weight) and 18 µg/g of the constitutive and induced terpenes,
8
9
10 98 respectively (vs. 2 mg/g (constitutive) and up to 18 mg/g (induced) in living spruces).
11
12
99 In addition, this setup allowed the colonization kinetics to be quantified and the spatial pattern
13
14
15 100 of attack holes to be characterized through time (the age of uprooted trees did not influence
16
17 101 the results described in the current work; Appendix S1, Supporting Information). For the
18
19 102 purpose of the present study, each of the boles was divided into 2 observation segments
20
21 103 (Figure S1, Supporting Information): a 3-m-long basal segment starting from the tree collar
22
23
24 104 and a 5-m-long upper segment starting 4 m from the collar.
25
26
105 The 1-m-long segment between the basal and upper segments was covered with a fine
27
28
29 106 (0.4 mm) transparent PVC sheet to prevent colonization, and on 4 of the 8 trees, insects
30
31 107 slipping on this non-adhesive surface were collected in containers at the bottom of the bolts to
32
33 108 estimate overall daily landing rates during the entire observation period. The collected insects
34
35 109 were sexed by genitalia extraction, and the sex-ratio (SR=#males/#landed) remained stable
36
37
38
110 throughout the observations (weighted linear relationship: SR=f(t), F1,14=0.098, P=0.76) with
39
40 111 a mean weighted value of SR=0.38 (with weight corresponding to the number of sexed landed
41
42 112 insects per day). The daily landing rate of males was computed from the daily landing rates
43
44 113 using this mean SR.
45
46
47 114 In addition, since the two segments of each tree were physically separated by this mid-section,
48
49 115 which was impassable by walking and whose length (1 m) was far greater than the MAD
50
51
52
116 between attack holes (ca 2.5 cm) as described by Byers [23], the lower and upper segments
53
54 117 were each treated as independent replicates.

3 118 New entrance holes were marked with numbered pins, and the date of each attack was
4
5 119 recorded for analysis. New holes were monitored at least daily until the 17th day (from
6
7 120 06/06/2013 to 23/06/2013) and approximately every 7 days thereafter (from 23/06/2013 to
8
9
10 121 09/07/2013, i.e., days 17 to 45). The lower part of the stem was not easily accessed as it was
11
12 122 often close to, or touching, the ground. Therefore, we recorded what we could observe, and
13
14 123 every record was included in the study. However, there were very few attacks on the
15
16 124 underside.
17
18
19 125 To initiate colonization, two pheromones dispensers were applied per tree (sealed polythene
20
21 126 bags containing 1.64 g of 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MB) (Sigma–Aldrich, 98 % chemical
22
23
24 127 purity) and 0.08 g of (S)-cis-verbenol (cV) (Sigma–Aldrich, 95 % chemical purity; P50 %
25
26 128 optical purity) [32] on each segment (2.5 m, basal segment; 5.5 m, upper segment). Release
27
28 129 rates were 17 mg/day and 2.6 mg/day for MB and cV, respectively, as estimated from the
29
30 130 weight loss in a wind-tunnel (0.06 m/s, 20°C). Pheromone dispensers were removed when 20
31
32
131 holes were counted anywhere around the trunks within 50 cm of both sides of the dispensers
33
34
35 132 (Figure S1, Supporting Information).
36
37
38
133 The pheromones were removed from 12 segments before the end of the observations at a
39
40 134 median time of 100 h [78;148.5] (N=13), when an 61.3±16.1 % of the total number of holes
41
42 135 (HEND) was observed. One segment retained its pheromone dispenser the whole time and
43
44 136 eventually displayed 0.57 attacks/dm2. Statistical analysis showed that the pheromone
45
46
137 dispensers did not influence the spatial colonization pattern (deviation test: basal segment,
47
48
49 138 P=0.355; upper segment, P=0.366; see Appendix S3, Supporting Information).
50
51
52
139 Three of the 16 segments exhibited particularly low numbers of holes (<30 holes) despite
53
54 140 having colonization dynamics similar to those of the other segments, and significant bark

8 143 Validation: observations of naturally infested, whole trees
9
10
11 144 This part of the study focused on three spruces in Smuid (Province of Luxembourg, Belgium)
12
13 145 that were windfelled in the winter of 2014-2015 and remained on the ground. Roots were
14
15 146 partially in contact with the soil, and the trees were pruned up to, but excluded, the crown
16
17
18
147 before the observations began. No pheromone dispenser was added, and colonization
19
20 148 occurred spontaneously over the trees. New entrance holes were marked with numbered pins
21
22 149 every 1-3 days, depending on the weather conditions, during the main flight period from
23
24 150 05/06/2015 to 08/07/2015.
25
26
27 151 Data collection
28
29 152 Once the observations were complete, the segments or the attacked parts of the whole trees
30
31
32
153 were wrapped in cellophane sheets, on which the position and number of the pins were
33
34 154 marked. The sheets were then removed and photographed in the laboratory, and the
35
36 155 successive pictures were stitched together prior to analysis. The Cartesian coordinates of the
37
38 156 attack holes were measured using ImageJ software (version 1.49t, [33]) with the X-axis
39
40
157 corresponding to the positions along the length of the tree, while the Y-axis corresponded to
41
42
43 158 the positions around the circumference of the tree with y=0 corresponding to the upper rim of
44
45 159 the tree.
46
47
48 160 In addition to the attack holes, patches of bark showing a rough texture (rough bark mostly
49
50 161 located around branches and a smooth texture over almost the entire tree; Figure S2,
51
52 162 Supporting Information) were delineated on the cellophane sheet. The area of each type of
53

8 166 Statistical analysis
9
10 167 When the normality of the distributions was confirmed (Shapiro-Wilk test), the results were
11
12
168 presented as the mean±sd (N); otherwise, medians [Q1; Q3] (N) were used. The significance
13
14
15 169 level for all statistical tests was a=0.05.
16
17
18
170 Colonization dynamics
19
20
171 Colonization dynamics were analysed by considering the entire surface available on each
21
22
23 172 segment of area, Asegment (in dm2), as a proxy of its maximum carrying capacity, and the
24
25 173 number of attack holes, H, at each time step. The associated attack density, hereafter referred
26
27 174 to as segment density, was defined as <U+039B>segment=H/Asegment (holes/dm2).
28
29
30 175 Spatial patterns
31
32 176 The R [34] package spatstat [35] was used to analyse the spatial pattern of the attack holes
33
34 177 and its departure from CSR (complete spatial randomness, which is synonymous to the
35
36
37 178 homogeneous Poisson point processes [36]). Spatial pattern analyses were conducted after
38
39 179 computing the region of interest defined by the convex hull of the infested patch, i.e., the most
40
41 180 compact convex polygon encompassing all the holes at the end of colonization (Figure 3 a)
42
43 181 whose area was defined as Ahull (dm2). The attack density on the convex hull, hereafter
44
45
46
182 referred to as hull density (<U+03BB>hull), was computed at different times during colonization as
47
48 183 <U+03BB>hull=H/Ahull (holes/dm2).
49
50
51 184 Pointwise envelopes - Departure from CSR was assessed by comparing the G-function
52
53 185 (nearest distance between two attack holes) and the L-function (Besag's transformation of
54
55 186 Ripley's K-function, i.e., the number of events within a given distance from any particular
56
57 187 event), which were calculated from the observed patterns, to an envelope of Monte-Carlo

4

6
7 190 lower Poisson envelope at some distances and clustered if located above the upper Poisson
8
9
10 191 envelope (for the interpretation of confidence envelopes, see [38]). The transformed

12 192 distribution G’(r) can be used to stabilize the variance of G(r),   () = arcsin(()) [37].

21
22 196 possible range of interactions between points). The function T(r) is calculated from the
23
24
197 observed data, Tobs(r), and from N simulated point patterns under a null hypothesis, Ti(r),
25
26
27 198 i=1,…,N, and its average is denoted as () . We used the G’- and L-functions as summary
28
29 199 statistics to test for significant departures from CSR. Agreement between the statistical
30
31 200 analyses of both functions was necessary to characterize any given pattern as regular or
32
33
201 random (CSR).
34
35
36 202 Using the same functions and methods, the density of regular pattern detection, <U+03BB>detection (i.e.,
37
38
203 the density at which a regular pattern is discriminated from CSR), was determined for each
39
40
41 204 segment by iteratively computing the dclf test p-value of the successive steps of the
42
43 205 colonization patterns.
44
45
46 206 We determined the general spatial structure of all replicates by aggregating the statistical

8 212 Simulating random colonization with an inhibition distance – The mechanisms impeding
9
10
11 213 additional holes within a certain distance of earlier attacks remain unknown, but they could
12
13 214 pertain to inhibition or to a lack of stimulation. In this study, however, we will label these
14
15 215 unknown mechanisms as "inhibition" for the sake of concision. Random colonization with an
16
17 216 inhibition distance r (cm) was simulated using a simple sequential inhibition (SSI [36,38])
18
19
217 algorithm provided by the rSSI function of the R package spatstat as follows. At each
20
21
22 218 iteration, a new hole was generated at random within the environment and independently of
23
24 219 the preceding holes. If the new hole was closer than the distance r to any pre-existing attack,
25
26 220 it was rejected, and another random hole was generated. Under default settings, the algorithm
27
28 221 terminated when the N holes were placed on the area.
29
30
31 222 The SSI algorithm uses an inhibition distance r defining a circular rejection area. This agrees
32
33
223 well with preliminary investigations indicating that the distributions of nearest-neighbour
34
35
36 224 distances along the X-axis (4.22 cm [2.1;6.51] (N=1614)) and Y-axis (4.21 cm [2.37;6.23],
37
38 225 (N=1614)) are similar (Wilcoxon rank sum test: W=1286935, P=0.56).

3 228 The temporal colonization dynamics of the segments was nonlinear: the colonization rate rose
4
5 229 for a short period and then constantly decreased until the number of holes reached a plateau
6
7 230 HEND=124.31±43.18 (N=13) (Figure 1 a). The proportion of holes visible at first measurement
8
9
10 231 (day 2) was H1/HEND= 0.12 [0.09;0.19] (N=13). Fifty percent of the final number of holes
11
12 232 occurred within the first 4 days [4;4] (N=13), and 90 % (all segments combined) were

14 233 observed at day 14.

23 236 where HEND stands for the number of holes counted at the end of the observations, and ß
24
25 237 controls the steepness of the curve with high ß values leading to shorter durations to reach
26
27 238 HEND (non-linear fitting: ß=-0.206±0.07 day-1, N=13, with R2 ranging 0.92 to 0.99). There was
28
29
239 no relationship between ß and HEND (linear regression, P=0.859).
30
31
32 240 Two successive stages can be observed on almost every segment: a first stage from day 0
33
34
35
241 (initiation of observations) to day 11, during which the number of holes reached a quasi-
36
37 242 plateau (HFIRST), followed by a second stage from day 12 to day 45 (end of observations)
38
39 243 leading to a second plateau (HSECOND with HFIRST+HSECOND=HEND). However, most of the
40
41 244 attacks occurred during the first stage (HSECOND/HFIRST=0.311 [0.207;0.379], N=13). There
42
43 245 was no relationship between the values of HFIRST and HSECOND (Figure S3, Supporting
44
45
46 246 Information).
47
48
247 The daily colonization intensity was well correlated to the number of males landing during all
49
50
51 248 the observations (Figure 1 b; Pearson's product-moment correlation, <U+03C1>=0.91, t=9.34, df=19,
52
53 249 P<0.0001), which indicates that the observed colonization dynamics are directly influenced
54
55 250 by insect availability; the increase in the number of landing males from the first to the second
56
57 251 measurement probably explains the short increase in the rate of attack observed at the
58

3 252 beginning of colonization (Figure 1 a). In addition, the landing rate strongly correlates with
4
5 253 the average temperature measured during the observations (Appendix S7 and Figure S4,
6
7 254 Supporting Information), which is known to influence the emergence and flight behaviour of
8
9
10 255 the beetles. These results indicate that the two plateaus observed in the global shape of the
11
12 256 colonization dynamics only result from a beetle shortage, but the stagnation of the number of
13
14 257 holes, despite the observation of a third landing stage on the 31st day (Figure 1 b), suggests
15
16 258 that other regulating mechanisms may be at work.
17
18
19 259 The area of the segments (Asegment) showed a linear relationship with the area of the convex
20
21 260 hull (Ahull; Ahull=0.72×Asegment-18.8 dm2, R2=0.73, F1,11=33.8, P<0.0001), while the final
22
23
24 261 number of holes was not related with the area of the segments (HEND=0.21×Asegment+64.9,
25
26 262 R2=0.03, F1,11=1.36, P=0.27). This means that the probability of colonization per unit area is
27
28 263 not equal between segments. In contrast, the final numbers of holes and the areas of the
29
30 264 convex hulls were related (HEND=0.46×Ahull+39.7, R2=0.30, F1,11=6.19, P=0.03), which agreed
31
32
265 with the complementary analysis (Appendix S8, Supporting Information) and indicated that
33
34
35 266 for density values similar to those observed in our observations, the number of holes
36
37 267 influences the area of the convex hull in a predictable fashion. The following analysis
38
39 268 indicated that the different trees are characterized by different intrinsic receptivities that can
40
41 269 explain these differences.
42
43
44 270 To investigate the high variability in both the first plateau (HFIRST) and the final number of
45
46
271 holes (HEND) on each segment, we simulated the installation of 1614 holes (the total number
47
48
49 272 of holes on the 13 segments) within 13 compartments with areas similar to those of the
50
51 273 segments, using a SSI with r=0 (with this null inhibition distance, the infestation followed a
52
53 274 random Poisson process). The comparison of the observed densities at the end of the
54
55 275 colonization process with those obtained by 10,000 simulations indicated that colonization
56
57
58 276 was not random among segments (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, D=0.364,

2
3 277 P<0.032), which suggests that the variability in the plateau value HEND between observations
4
5 278 was due to either a heterogeneous distribution of the flying insects around the segments
6
7 279 and/or a difference in receptivity between the segments.
8

10 280 Therefore, we describe the colonization of the segments as follows:

24 283 where F(t) stands for the instantaneous flow of flying insects at time t; Ai is the area of the
25
26
27 284 segment I; ai is the receptivity of this segment; and Hi is the cumulative number of holes on
28
29 285 this segment at time t.
30
31
32 286 Coupling the equations 3 b, the relative colonization of each segment compared to the others
33
34 287 is described as

36
3 3:

38 : 9:
39
40
41 289 where the density <U+039B>i of segment i is <U+039B>i=Hi/Ai. The homogeneous flow of flying insects, F(t),
42
43 290 around the segments is indicated by a linear relationship between the segment densities, <U+039B>i
44
45 291 and <U+039B>j, with a slope defined as the ratio of the receptivity of each segment, ai/aj.
46
47
48 292 Each pair of segments shows a characteristic relationship between their <U+039B> values (for a plot of
49
50 293 all relationships among pairs, see Figure S6, Supporting Information). During the first
51
52 294 colonization stage, a linear relationship describes the link between the <U+039B> of each couple at any
53
54
55
295 time well (R2=0.97 [0.95;0.99], N=78), indicating that the density of flying insects is similar
56
57 296 around each segment and that there is no amplification or competition between them. When

4
5 298 slope is significantly different from that in the first stage in 70% of the pairs (using segment 1
6
7 299 as a reference with receptivity a1=1; first stage: aFIRST=1.42±0.57, N=13; second stage:
8
9
10 300 aSECOND=2.73±1.78, N=13). There was no significant relationship between both receptivity
11
12 301 values (aFIRST and aSECOND) in any given segment. Moreover, the variation in the receptivity of
13
14 302 the segments (<U+2206>a=aSECOND-aFIRST) was not related to the density at the end of the first
15
16 303 colonization stage (<U+039B>FIRST), which indicates that the number of holes that occurred during the
17
18
304 first stage did not influence, in a predictable fashion, the number of additional holes occurring
19
20
21 305 during the second stage. There was a strong relationship between the initial receptivities
22
23 306 (aFIRST) of the basal and upper segments of any given tree (aFIRST basal = 1.25 aFIRST basal -0.05,
24
25 307 R2=0.81, F1,4=22.5, P=0.009), indicating that each tree was characterized by its own global
26

3 310 The global density of holes (all segments regrouped) at the end of the observations was
4
5 311 6.3 times higher on rough bark (final <U+039B>smooth=0.37 holes/dm2; <U+039B>rough=2.33 holes/dm2; Figure
6
7 312 2 a). Moreover, the hole density on rough bark was linearly related to that on smooth bark at
8
9
10 313 the same time step (<U+039B>rough=6.55×<U+039B>smooth-0.001, F1,13=1.35×104, P<0.0001, R2=0.99), indicating
11
12 314 that the respective rates of discovery and infestation of both textures remained constant
13
14 315 throughout the observations. This higher density of holes on rough bark was observed on each
15
16
17
316 segment (see Figure 2 b). We did not find any relationship between the area of each texture or
18
19 317 the ratio of rough bark with either plateau value of hole number (HFIRST and HSECOND) (linear
20
21 318 regression: P>0.05).
22
23
24 319 The spatial pattern of holes involves a spacing mechanism
25
26
27 320 a) The final spatial pattern of holes is regular
28
29
30 321 The pointwise envelopes (Figure 3 b-d) and dclf tests indicated that 9 of the 13 segments
31
32 322 showed a regular attack distribution at the end of the observations (dclf test: P=0.05), while
33
34 323 the other 4 were characterized by a random pattern (dclf test: P>0.05 for one of the G’- or L-
35
36 324 based dclf tests; Table S2, Supporting Information). It is worth noting that the distribution of
37
38
325 the holes on 3 of these 4 segments, all of which were characterized by low density values, was
39
40
41 326 close to a regular pattern (P=0.05 for one of the G’- or L-based dclf tests, with P close to 0.05
42
43 327 for the other test; Table S2, Supporting Information). This suggests that, had colonization
44
45 328 continued, the pattern on these four segments would have been characterized as regular.
46
47
48 329 Moreover, a statistical analysis considering all replicates together indicated that the data were
49
50 330 more regular than under a CSR hypothesis (Figure 3 d) since the observed curve is under the
51
52
331 CSR envelopes for short distances. This result was confirmed by the dclf test with P=0.001.

7
8
335 b) Regularity arises when a sufficient hole density is achieved
9
10
11 336 While hole patterns appeared to be randomly distributed at low densities (CSR), those
12
13
14
337 observed at high densities were regular (Table S2, Supporting Information), suggesting the
15
16 338 existence of a minimal density at which a regular pattern can be discriminated from CSR
17
18 339 (<U+03BB>detection=0.69 attacks/dm2 [0.56;0.71], N=9; Figure 4 b; Kruskal-Wallis > = 6.637,

20 340 P=0.036; post hoc test: the only significant difference was between final densities of random
21

23
24
25 342 spaces (this will be confirmed later). The density allowing the detection of a regular pattern
26
27 343 was almost twice as high as the density recorded at the time of pheromone lure removal
28
29 344 (<U+03BB>detection/<U+03BB>pherom=1.50 [1.16;1.67], N=9).
30
31
32 345 c) The distance to the nearest neighbour decreases with hole density
33
34
35 346 The mean distance to the nearest neighbour (NNdist) decreased monotonically with density
36
37 347 following a power law of the form CC2=1 = D × F8 (Figure 5 a). This statistically significant
38
39 348 relationship was observed in each replicate (<U+03B3>=6.10±0.39; a=-0.44±0.11; r2=0.96±0.04,
40
41
42 349 N=13). Figure 5 a shows the mean curve fitted to the values of all segments combined
43
44 350 (<U+03B3>=5.92; a=-0.50; r2=0.92).
45
46
47 351 d) Variations in the spacing mechanism are partly explained by hole density
48
49 352 The distance at which the nearest-neighbour distance function G(r) first crosses the lower
50
51 353 CSR envelope indicates the existence of an inhibition mechanism regulating beetle
52
53 354 establishment and provides a first approximation of the inhibition distance (MAD). Figure 5 b
54
55
56 355 shows that Ips typographus iteratively fills the empty space using a spacing mechanism.
57
58 356 Moreover, the minimum nearest-neighbour distance (NNdistmin) observed at each time step

3 357 decreases with time/holes density, giving a more accurate estimation of the inhibition distance
4
5 358 as it tends towards its actual value as colonization proceeds.
6
7
8 359 Colonization is dynamic, homogeneous, and non-diffusive
9
10
11 360 a) Attacks fill the available space on the tree
12
13
14 361 The spatio-temporal pattern of attack holes was similar between replicates. The first holes
15
16 362 were randomly located, covering almost the entire segment (Figure 6), and the following
17
18 363 holes were scattered over the segment, filling the empty space. Figure 5 c and d show this
19
20
364 phenomenon: the mean nearest-neighbour distance between attacks at times up to t and
21
22
23 365 attacks occurring at the next time step, t+1, tends to increase with time (Figure 5 c). However,
24
25 366 since new attacks are more numerous at the beginning of the infestation (Figure 1 a), the
26
27 367 inverse trend is observed when the rate of new attacks between time step t and t+1 is
28
29 368 considered: this relationship indicates that new holes appear closer to each other. This
30
31
32
369 empirical description was confirmed by a complementary analysis based on statistical
33
34 370 methods dedicated to the study of point process patterns (Appendix S12, Supporting
35
36 371 Information) that indicated that there are interactions between the attacks (i.e., inhibition)
37
38 372 throughout the entire colonization process. Moreover, it appeared that the sole filling of the
39
40
373 empty areas by new holes could explain the observed decrease in the nearest-neighbour
41
42
43 374 distance (Appendix S13, Supporting Information); the average and observed distance to the
44
45 375 nearest neighbour decrease with increasing density (density increases with time). Additional
46
47 376 analysis suggested that the inhibition distance is barely affected by the age of the attacks
48
49 377 (Appendix S17, Supporting Information).
50
51
52 378 b) Colonization is homogeneous over the entire available surface
53
54
55 379 The spread of the holes along the X-axis (distance between the most distant projected holes)
56
57 380 at the first measurement was close to that measured at the end of the observations; the spreads

1
2
3 381 of holes along the X-axis at the first measurement (spread1) and the final pattern (spreadEND)
4
5 382 showed a strong linear relationship (spread1=0.782×spreadEND+22.120, F1,11=25.5, P<<0.001,
6
7 383 R2=0.67; Figure S8 a, Supporting Information). These patches of holes covered almost the
8
9
10 384 entire available length (seg.length) of each segment (spreadEND/seg.length=0.95 [0.91;1.00]
11
12 385 N=13). It should be noted again that the location of the pheromone dispenser had no influence
13
14 386 on hole locations (for a formal test, see Appendix S3, Supporting Information).
15
16
17 387 The fraction of holes observed at the end of the observations that were already observed at the
18
19 388 first measurement (H1/HEND) ranged from 4 to 48% (median=15.3 [9.90; 19.0] N=13), but the
20
21 389 number of holes at this first measurement (H1) did not influence the spread of the holes over
22
23
24 390 the X-axis. The number of holes quickly reached almost the maximum value
25
26 391 (spread1/spreadEND=0.72+0.00356×H1, F1,11=1.53, P=0.24). In addition, the coverage of the
27
28 392 colonized patch quickly approached its maximal value: on day 3, the relative coverage was
29
30 393 73.1±11.9% (N=13) while 35.7±11.6% (N=13) of the final number of holes was recorded.
31
32
33 394 Moreover, there was no relationship between the time and location of the holes along the X-
34
35 395 axis (Figure S8 b, Supporting Information) in 9 of 13 replicates. In the 4 replicates showing a
36
37
38
396 statistical relationship, this trend was very mild considering the low R2 values (max=0.21) and
39
40 397 the small displacement of the centre of gravity of the holes, X, through time (maximum of
41
42 398 16.6 cm over 30 days on a 5-m-long segment; Table S4, Supporting Information). This
43
44 399 indicates that the segment was filled with holes without any preferential location during the
45
46
400 entire observation period.
47
48
49 401 In terms of spatial pattern, the spread of holes over the segment length (at first measurement
50
51 ) and the
52 402 or at the end of the observations), the mean nearest-neighbour distances (CCGH)
53
54 403 densities of regular pattern detection (<U+03BB>detection) seem unaffected by segment size (Table S5,
55
56 404 Supporting Information).

3 405 Finally, we conducted simulations of random attacks over segments with different
4
5 406 receptivities under the sole regulatory mechanism of an inhibition distance (Appendix S16,
6
7 407 Supporting Information). This theoretical analysis indicated that no plateau occurred within
8
9
10 408 the range of the observed hole densities and at inhibition distances compatible with our results
11
12 409 (Figure S9). Hence, the inhibition distance controls the location of successive holes over a
13
14 410 small range (a few centimetres) but does not significantly influence the infestation rate at the
15
16 411 global scale (meter scale) at common realistic densities.
17
18
19 412 Validation: observations on naturally infested whole trees
20
21
22 413 The three whole trees showed the same colonization dynamics and similar spread
23
24 414 characteristics as the segments, confirming that the pheromones used in the observations
25
26
415 described here, or the splitting of each tree into segments, did not influence the spatio-
27
28
29 416 temporal patterns (Figure 4 a & b, Figure 5 a; see Table S1, Supporting Information).
30
31
32 417 Discussion
33
34
418 Our analyses show that colonization first occurs without any preferred location or direction;
35
36
37 419 the insects apparently initially establish anywhere over almost the entire available surface. A
38
39 420 regular pattern is then progressively achieved by randomly occupying the still-vacant areas,
40
41 421 leading to a constant decrease in the distance to the nearest neighbour down to a minimum
42
43 422 below which new holes are not excavated. The theoretical values that we predicted agree well
44
45
46 423 with those reported by Byers [23] (Figure 5 a, blue dots), but this minimum was rarely
47
48 424 reached in our observations.
49
50
51 425 Interestingly, our description of the establishment of beetles on fallen trees, i.e., initially
52
53 426 covering most of the available bark surface and eventually being regulated by a short-distance
54
55 427 “inhibition” mechanism, strongly contrasts with that of Raffa and Berryman [11], who
56
57 428 reported that during the colonization of healthy standing pines by D. ponderosae, "the
58
59
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos 19
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 20 of 53
1
2
3 429 galleries were highly clustered at low attack densities. The degree of clustering then declined
4
5 430 as the number of entries increased, approaching uniformity at high densities." In contrast, we
6
7 431 observed that the first landings occurred anywhere on the trees. This, together with the
8
9
10 432 findings of Louis et al. [8] that fallen trees are very weakly defended, supports our hypothesis
11
12 433 that aggregation on fallen trees has no, or very little, relation to overcoming their resistance.
13
14 434 Aggregation on a weak host could thus mainly be a by-product of mass foraging (many
15
16 435 beetles in the air needed to spot the resources), but other benefits (e.g., escaping from natural
17
18
436 enemies or side-stepping competitors) should not be excluded. Although there is a possibility
19
20
21 437 that spatial attack patterns differ between bark beetle species, the most likely possibility is
22
23 438 that the constraints and mechanisms at play on weakened hosts radically differ from those
24
25 439 governing the colonization of standing trees. Further measurements are needed to complete
26
27 440 this comparison.
28
29
30 441 A striking aspect of our results is that many attacks occurred almost simultaneously. Within
31
32
442 five days, 37.7 to 87.4% of the beetles established on the segments. According to Chararas
33
34
35 443 [39] and our own unpublished observations, the egg galleries of I. typographus increase by ca.
36
37 444 4 mm per day, roughly corresponding to the laying of one or two eggs. Therefore, the very
38
39 445 early settlers not only risked very little, but they also gained very little leeway. On standing
40
41 446 trees, being the first to attack represents a serious risk, and some evidence has been gathered
42
43
44 447 in D. ponderosae that suggests that pioneering constitutes a "desperation" strategy chosen by
45
46 448 individuals that have already exhausted their resources during their quest for a host [40,41]
47
48 449 and that followers on standing trees have higher reproductive success than the pioneers. As
49
50 450 followers exploit a host found by others at some cost, they can be seen as "cheaters" [12,31]
51
52
451 although they also contribute to killing the host. On fallen trees, there is no such penalty for
53
54
55 452 "pioneering", as the first male beetle that lands is theoretically able to establish.

3 453 According to Stamps and Krishnan [42], new settlers benefit from larger territories when they
4
5 454 establish while respecting a "neighbour rule", i.e., a minimal distance from the neighbour. In
6
7 455 this study, the new settlers appeared to establish at random in all respects, sometimes far from
8
9
10 456 any neighbour but maintaining a minimal distance to their already-established neighbours.
11
12
457 Our simulations (Appendix S16, Supporting Information) showed that a maximum density of
13
14
15 458 3.13 attacks/dm² can occur at an “inhibition” distance of 2.5 cm. This is consistent with values
16
17 459 observed in the field for felled (0.25 to 3.5 attacks/dm²: [22,43–46]) as well as standing trees
18
19 460 (1 to 4 attacks/dm²: [19,44,46,47]). In our observation setup, attack density always remained
20
21 461 between ca. 0.4 and 1.2 holes/dm² (Figure 4 a), suggesting that other regulatory mechanisms
22
23
24 462 operate before this theoretical density is reached. As many landings occurred almost
25
26 463 simultaneously, the information perceived by new potential settlers must have been conveyed
27
28 464 very rapidly by the first beetles that established.
29
30
31 465 The mechanisms possibly regulating attack density have been thoroughly discussed by Byers
32
33 466 [24], and they include avoiding landing in densely colonized areas or leaving these areas after
34
35 467 landing, maintaining a sufficient distance from existing holes above or within the bark, and
36
37
38
468 re-emerging when brood densities are too high. In our observations, it is notable that the last
39
40 469 wave arriving on the trees did not establish at all (Figure 1 b). Landing without attack has
41
42 470 already been described by Anderbrant, Schlyter and Löfqvist [48], who reported a 15.8:1 ratio
43
44 471 of beetles landing vs. attacking, but a 3:1 ratio was reported by Paynter, Anderbrant and
45
46
472 Schlyter [49]. The fate of the beetles that chose not to attack is unknown, but when provided
47
48
49 473 with small bark slabs and spruce twigs, adult I. typographus have shown a relatively long
50
51 474 survival capacity of more than 14 days [50] to more than 25 days [51]. A high dispersal
52
53 475 capacity is also reported in this species [51], with up to 6 h and 20 min of flight in a flight mill
54
55 476 and one fourth of the tested beetles flying at least 1 h, corresponding to a distance of 18 km at
56
57
58 477 an estimated speed of 5 m.s-1. These capacities probably allow the insects to be fairly
59
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos 21
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 22 of 53
1
2
3 478 selective in terms of their breeding sites. In addition, I. typographus is probably flexible in its
4
5 479 acceptance of a host, and its previous experience could influence further choices, as reported
6
7 480 for Ips pini by Wallin and Raffa [52]. Under conditions of high population density, this could
8
9
10 481 push the insects towards eventually accepting settlement at higher densities (that our
11
12 482 simulations have shown as compatible with the 2.5-cm “inhibition” distance; Appendix S16,
13
14 483 Supporting Information), or at even larger population densities, the insects could be led to
15
16 484 shift to standing hosts [20].
17
18
19 485 Bark texture plays a strong role in the choice of attack locations. The rough bark at the base of
20
21 486 the branches exhibits higher hole densities than the smooth bark covering the rest of the
22
23
24 487 segments. There is no indication that the colonization process could end due to the saturation
25
26 488 of the preferred rough bark, and the ratio of densities on each bark type remains stable,
27
28 489 suggesting that the discovery of rough bark is due to random, non-oriented walks on the hosts.
29
30 490 This frequent settlement around branches is likely to be caused by irregularities in these
31
32
491 tissues that favour the initiation of an entry hole. Paynter et al. [49] report that I. typographus
33
34
35 492 mostly explores crevices during host colonization, and similar observations have been
36
37 493 reported for D. ponderosae by Safranyik and Vithayasai [27] and Ips calligraphus by Haack
38
39 494 et al. [53]. Such thigmotactic behaviour, which is observed in many other arthropods [54–57],
40
41 495 could be sufficient to arrest the beetles close to branches and lead to their settlement on
42
43
44 496 patches of rough bark. Moreover, a stable ratio of densities on each bark type and these
45
46 497 behavioural observations are also consistent with the ideal free distribution theory (IFD)
47
48 498 [58,59]. The IFD states that the density of individuals that will settle in various patches, e.g.,
49
50 499 patches of rough and smooth bark, is proportional to the amount of resources available in
51
52
500 each. For bark beetles, the roughness that facilitates excavation is itself a resource but should
53
54
55 501 also be an indicator of bark quality.

3 502 Although a number of unsolved issues should be explored further (spacing mechanisms,
4
5 503 possible changes in fitness relative to the order of arrival, and the flexibility allowed to each
6
7 504 individual to complete host selection through a series of trials and errors), our results strongly
8
9
10 505 suggest that, when weakened hosts are involved, the colonization behaviour of facultative
11
12 506 tree-killing bark beetles does not fit the widely accepted paradigm of "mass attack against tree
13
14 507 defence" but rather corresponds to the expected outcome of group-foraging for scarce
15
16 508 resources with mass-colonization only being an unnecessary consequence of mass-foraging,
17
18
509 with costs and benefits that vary widely from those associated with the mass-killing of healthy
19
20

14 pertinent to bark beetles and their host trees could be added. Overall, I think this
15 study has huge potential that might not even all fit in one paper. I hope the authors
16 will be able to revise to make testable predictions and perhaps do some new
17 analyses. I really look forward to its publication.
18 Hypotheses We chose to develop the reasoning below in the Introduction, and to address points 1-5
19 I suggest framing the data around alternative hypotheses in the Introduction: from the reviewer in the Discussion.
20 • Bark beetles use aggregation pheromones for group foraging, increasing their
21 individual chances of finding a host.
22 • When a male has found a host, it releases pheromones that attract potential
23 mates but also other "spying" males. The final result is aggregation on the new
24 host.
25 • Apart from mass-foraging, bark beetles also use aggregation pheromones to
26 overcome tree defences when they attack living, defended hosts. In this case,
27 they tend to aggregate around the initial attacks (those of "pioneers"), and the
28 subsequent attacks gradually diffuse outward until a regular distribution is
29 reached.
30 • Fallen trees have weak defences. When attacking this type of host, defences are
31 thus no longer a constraint (or a very weak one) for bark beetles, and the need to
32 concentrate the initial attacks on one spot to overcome local defences diminishes
33 or disappears. How this would affect colonization patterns is unknown.
34 • Under these conditions, how should we reconsider the status (risks and benefits)
35 of the "pioneers"?
36 1. Based on the biology of the system, with aggregation pheromones, we might See our response above.
37 expect mechanistically that settlement on a tree might be aggregated as has been
38 observed for a tree-killing species. Functionally, local aggregation could be
39 advantageous for mate attraction, which not made explicit in this system (the
40 implication was that it was just foraging). There is quite a literature on conspecific
41 attraction that has some pertinence.

settlement, as stated previously (37.7 to 87.4% of the beetles establish on the segments
25 within approximately five days with egg galleries progressing by ca. 4 mm/day and 1 to
26 2 eggs/day). We now fully consider simultaneous settlement in the Discussion.

14 be interesting to know if settlement patterns on different segments on the same tree

the most relevant, compact units (the patches), some analyses would indeed be more
relevant at the tree level, because of the individual variations between trees.
Reconsidering our approach, we thus identified two issues overall: the comparison of
densities on rough and smooth bark (illustrated by Fig. 2), and the infestation
dynamics (illustrated by Fig. 1). For these two particular cases, we kept all the analyses
based on individual segments, but we added complementary analyses bearing on
whole trees.
This is also developed below in the response to reviewer 5.
We are puzzled regarding the remarks about the premise of the paper. We believe
that the hypotheses by which we concluded the introduction are explicit enough:
"If landing on a defenceless host en masse is mainly or uniquely the
consequence of group foraging, we can expect that insects adopt different
strategies than concentrating on local tree defences. The objective of this
study is to analyse the colonization patterns of a facultative tree killer
infesting poorly defended hosts. Our main hypothesis is that the absence of
consistent defences would influence the spatio-temporal deployment of
the attacking beetles. A secondary question is whether, under these
conditions, the status (risks and benefits) of the "pioneers" should be
reconsidered."
Regarding this point, please see also our response to reviewer 2.
We hope that our modifications will meet your expectations and those of the referees.
Sincerely,
Etienne Toffin
Reviewer 4
This manuscript describes the dynamics of bark beetle attacks on trees that have very
low levels of chemical defenses, with the expectation that the behavior and attack
dynamics will differ from beetle attacks on highly defended trees. The authors were
able to show that, indeed, beetles behave quite differently on defenseless host
species, with the goal not of killing the tree, but to establish a bore hole with adequate
space for a large egg gallery. In trees in which attacks led to high densities of holes, a
regular distribution was observed, as the authors expected.
Data analyses were thorough and the analyses led convincingly to the conclusion of a
regular distribution. While a naturalist might suppose that this was the expected result,
this paper provides the data to confirm the expectation.

“random, non-oriented walks on the hosts.” A more compelling explanation comes
from an experimental study which tested the ability of bark beetles to cling to vertical
surfaces of either smooth or rough bark, and clearly demonstrated that a beetle placed
on smooth bark fell off quickly, but the same beetle placed on rough bark on the same
tree showed the normal degree of agility:

As suggested, we removed the term “global”.
The authors use the phrase “global intrinsic receptivity” when they consider whether
defenses change with height along the bole of the tree. “Global” does not seem
appropriate when discussing variation in one tree. One could discuss whether resin
pressure or chemical defenses or resistance or susceptibility varied with height above
the ground.
Reviewer 5
The manuscript describes a detailed study following Ips typographus attack sequence
and distribution on wind thrown trees. The results are interpreted through a number
of statistical methods, most of which I cannot comment on. My review therefore
focuses on the presentation and interpretation of the results obtained.
The authors have addressed a number of comments provided by three reviewers of We agree that there definitely is a correlation between the two segments of each tree. We

constituents.
“Regarding the main observations, the separation into 2 segments corresponds
to a physical partitioning of the trees before the observations rather than to an a
posteriori discretization of a unique infestation patch into two subsets of attacks.
Moreover, considering the characteristic inhibition distance (2.5 cm), it seems
reasonable to assume that holes on the two segments from the same tree
cannot inhibit each other across the 1,000-cm-long PVC sheet (on which none of
the insects could either walk or settle).”
We hence decided to keep focusing our spatio-temporal analyses on individual segments.
However, we answered the concerns of the referees by adding complementary analyses
where segments from the same tree could be considered as non independent:
1. We compared the density of attacks on smooth and rough bark on each entire
tree (density of attacks on all rough bark on a tree vs. density of attacks on all
smooth bark on same tree; Wilcoxon rank sum test: W=0, P=0.031). We
obtained similar results as when all segments were treated as independent
replicates. This was added in the Results section (line 744).
2. The independent analysis of each segment raised concerns about the possible
correlation between the two segments of a same tree. We thus added a
complementary quantification of the infestation dynamics of the entire trees
(summing the attacks on the upper and basal segments from each tree). This
was added to the Results, (line 241) and Figure 1 a was modified to show
dynamics curves of an entire tree and those of its two segments.
Otherwise, I have commented throughout the adobe manuscript on the items I feel
could use further explanation or re-wording.

Reviewer 2
This study thoroughly analyzes temporal and spatial patterns of beetle settlement with
a variety of statistical approaches. This may be one of the most comprehensive sets of
analyses of settlement behavior, a question that has not been often addressed
lately. My concern is that the analyses of these data dominate the paper while the
ecology is relatively thin.
Overall, I accept the statistical methods are done correctly but that is partly based on
the sheer number of them that are overwhelming at times.
Dependence of bark segments:
Although I quibble with the assumption that all bark segments are independent (the
We discuss this point above (see response to reviewer 5)
authors have evidence to the contrary, i.e. that segments of the same tree are more
similar to each other than to segments), I don't think this is critical for the current
study. Clarify the purpose of some analyses:

independence of segments). In general, the first section of the Results is fancy • last sentence of the section (l.206): “We determined the general spatial structure of all

We rewrote this sentence to make it clearer with the following: “We characterized the
global spatial pattern exhibited among all the segments by aggregating the statistical
results for each replicate.”
Differences in receptivity:
Despite quantitative differences, we highlight a common dynamics and thus a general
process occurring similarly on all segments/trees. This part highlights stability in the
results.
My biggest concern remains with the premise of the study. The authors did not make We agree that the premise of the study is an important element. However, because we
a compelling case that the settlement dynamics of tree-killing beetles are well known still have limited information regarding infestation patterns of standing vs. lying trees (as
the reviewer pointed out, we have only one study for each case), we find it difficult to try
but those inhabiting weakened trees are not. Similar numbers of citations are given
generalizing at this stage. The Safranyik and Vithayasai (1971) paper does not contribute
for both cases. The pattern for tree-killers hinges on one study of mountain pine in this respect to this discussion, because it does not consider temporal changes in attack
beetles (Raffa and Berryman 1983) where it appears that settlement is initially distribution. We are planning to expand the present study to the spatio-temporal analysis

which does not suggest aggregation behavior. The current study finds a different more general hypothesis. At this point, we think that the hypotheses offered at the end of
the introduction ("the absence of consistent defences would influence the spatio-temporal
temporal settlement pattern than did Raffa & Berryman, but the comparison is deployment of the attacking beetles"; "the status (risks and benefits) of the "pioneers"
between just two studies so it is difficult to make much inference. It could well be that should be reconsidered") go as far as our data and results allow.
it's related to differences in tree defenses, as the authors suggest, but it could be due
to any number of other differences between the two species and two studies. To Safranyik and Vithayasai (1971) present the results of several experiments. In one set of

logs. The beetles settled regularly. This does not appear relevant to the present study
aggregated, Fig. 4 alone seems sufficient.
because, as said above, there was no study of a temporal sequence. In another
experiment, Safranyik and Vithayasai (1971) measured the distribution of attacks on
standing trees, naturally attacked, and found out that the distribution was regular. This
last result is similar to those reported by Raffa and Berryman (1983): at the end of the
colonisation process, the attacks are regularly distributed. However, the spatio-temporal
sequence leading to this distribution was not recorded, and therefore we can only use
Safranyik and Vithayasai's results to confirm Raffa and Berryman's final observations. We
added this in our discussion.
A last experiment reported by Safranyik and Vithayasai (1971) was that rough bark was
more attacked than smooth (or artificially smoothened) bark. This was already mentioned
in our discussion on this point.
The hypothesis proposed at the end of the Introduction is very non-committal: that the We developed the hypothesis presented at the end of the introduction.

was to characterize the infestation pattern during host colonization. We think that a full

compare alternative settlement strategies.
The mention of the Ideal Free Distribution (line 497) with respect to bark roughness is
not integrated with the other results: if beetles are paying attention to the local
densities between rough and smooth, what are the implications for overall settlement
patterns?
Still other strategies could be plausible. I think beetles could settle to be evenly
distributed to maximize space if the final densities are unpredictable as they might be
in undefended trees. This hypothesis makes the same prediction that beetles should
fully use the available space from the start, which the authors use just to argue against
aggregated settlement. I still think that much more hypothesis testing can be done
with this data set and with these authors' computational skills that would make this
study of greater interest to ecologists in general.
However, maybe these aren't the authors to run with testing various settlement
strategies from a behavioural ecology perspective. There is definitely value in the
current work in terms of analysis methods and perhaps that's sufficient for this journal.
