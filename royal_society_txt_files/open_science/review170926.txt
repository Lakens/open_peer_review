In this work, folic acid wastewater was treated by three-dimensional electro-Fenton method. The
authors analyzed the mechanism and proposed the kinetics of the reaction for folic acid
degradation. The research is right on cutting-edge of the field. The work was well executed and
the paper was also well crafted, the results are sure to be high impact. I would recommend
publication of this manuscript by addressing the following minor issues.
1. In the introduction section, Fenton oxidation can be briefly described. Besides, the electro-
Fenton process should be introduced in detail. Some newly emerging Fenton-like technologies
should also be described (e.g., Journal of Power Sources 2015, 291, 108-116; Water Res. 2017,
119:67-72).
2. Page2,line 33-36: A series of chain Fenton reactions should be introduced in detail.
3. The references (reference [7],[23]) in the tense need to be consistent.

Introduction
Please cite a reference for the statement “wastewater is one of the most polluting effluents produced
by the pharmaceutical processing”
Precise RhB=Rhodamine B
Which kind of modified cathode was used by Liu[24] p.3
You should add some information about folic acid degradation actual knowledge and the interest of
your kinetic study in the introduction
Materials and methods
Statistical analyses are brought up in Author’s contribution, although they are not presented in the
materials and methods section, they should be presented. How many repetitions were performed for
each condition?
Error bars are missing on graphs (Fig 1,2,4,5,6). It is difficult (or even statistically inappropriate) to
compare results without standard deviations.
§2.3 some imprecisions:
“the desired amount of 1.5g/l” this concentration is variable (0,0.5,1,1.5g/L)
“a certain amount of FeSO4” isn’t it always 1mM?
§2.4 LCMS description is incomplete : which are the elution conditions (isocratic or gradient,
proportion of each mobile phase…..), type of analyser used for the MS?
You should add some paragraph dealing with COD determination, method used, number of analysis
per sample, results uncertainty (could be used as error bars for the graphics).
You should add a paragraph on your 44 orthogonal test and explain how you have obtained K and R
values and their meanings.
Results and discussion
Results are often only presented without further discussion.
§3.1 is the third electrode really necessary? PAC 0g/L allows also a good COD reduction in 12h.
One may wonder whether the results at 120 min are really (I mean statistically) different between
PAC 0 and 1.0g/l
§ 3.2 According to the K values does a current of 10.26 mA/cm2 really (statistically…) give better
results than 7.36mA/cm2?
All these K and R values have units (mg/l I suppose).
You should add conclusions with regard to the R values.
§3.3 How were the degradation products identified? (mass spectra? Retention times of standards?)
§3.4 the interest of the kinetic study should be highlighted
§3.4.1 is part of 3.4.2 : the reported values are the same for the COD value of 1039… This is
confusing. One could believe that the 3.4.1 experiment was performed on experimental raw water
with a COD of 1041 (§2.1) and the 3.4.2 experiment on simulated folic acid waste water.
Results in table 4 are inconsistent with the 1/c values in the file “supporting data” for c0=800mg/l (2
first values inconsistent) and c0=500mg/l (6 values in the row are incoherent).
General remarks
Modify : “air” sparge rate is different from “oxygen” sparging rate in table 2
Figure captions sometimes inaccurate for example
Fig 1 PAC 10g??? 1.5g/l in the text
Fig 2 reaction time varies : remove “reaction time = 120 min”, the current density is only
2.64mA/cm2, remove 0mA/cm2……

Response to reviwers
Reviewer #1:
1. Page 2, Line 21: List environmental and human health problems due to folic acid
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. The line is supplemented per suggestion of
reviewer.
2. Typographical errors are needed to be rectified. For example “fenton”.
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. As suggested by the reviewer, some
typographical errors are corrected.
3. Page 2, Line 42: Check the ferrous and hydrogen peroxide concentrations.
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. The ferrous and hydrogen peroxide
concentrations have been checked, they are correct.
4. Reviewer is not agreeing with “Electro-fenton’s research began in 1980s”
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. The year is verified and given a
reference.( Brillas E, Sires I, Oturan M A. Electro-Fenton process and related
electrochemical technologies based on Fenton's reaction chemistry [J].Chem
Rev.,2009,109:6570-6631.) In 1876, Fenton’s pioneering work pointed out the
possible use of a mixture of H2O2 and Fe2+ to destroy tartaric acid.
5. Page 2 Line 50: Support the sentence with Desalination, 299:1–15; RSC Advances,
4:5698-5708; RSC Advances, 5:40552–40577
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. We have added the three references for
supporting the sentence.
6. Page 2, Line 58: hydroxyl radical is not intermediate
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. The error is corrected and we have changed it to
highly active groups. It has been modified and marked in the text.
7. Page 3, Line 4: Support the sentence with Clean- Soil, Air, Water.
42(12):1701-1711; Separation and Purification Technology, 132: 568–576., . Clean-
Soil, Air, Water. 42 (6):779-784.
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. The references are quoted to support this
sentence.
8. Page 4, Line 13: Reviewer is not agreed with the sentence. Please check the article
Environmental Progress and Sustainable Energy. 35(6):1616-1622
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. We have read and quoted the article and we think
it is about evaluating the functional role of carbonic anhydrase in the biosequestration
of CO2 through microalgae along with its types, mechanism and established
localization in photosynthetic organisms while we talk about the application of
three-dimensional electrode. In order to ensure the preciseness of the language, we
modified the sentence in the text.
9. Characteristics of wastewater is needed
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. Characteristics of wastewater have been added to
the text.
10. All units should be uniform.
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. All units are checked and modified in the text.
11. Experimental set up figure needs to be provided.
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. Experimental set up figure is provided in the text.
12. What is the sorptive removal in the reactor
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. When PAC is put into the reactor, it exists
adsorption, but after PAC absorbed saturation, the degradation of the organic
pollutants is mainly catalyzed by the oxidation. Our laboratory studies the degradation
of . organic pollutants after PAC absorbed saturation.
13. Figure 1 is not required.
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. Figure 1 has been deleted, and it should be noted
that in the process of the Fenton reaction, we use saturated PAC.
14. Most of the experiments were conducted at pH 5. Is pH 5 is optimal for EF
process?
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. The optimal pH value is chosen by orthogonal
experiment which can be seen from Table 2 and present in § 3.2.
15. Discussion part is too weak.
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. We have made a detailed complement to the
discussion part, and it's been modified in the document. We mainly complement these
parts, effect of PAC on the electro-Fenton oxidation of folic acid wastewater, effect of
pH, current density, aeration rate and reaction time on folic acid wastewater
pretreatment, study on degradation products of folic acid.
16. Table 3 and 4 can be converted as figure.
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. We have converted the Table 3 to figure, while
we don’t converted Table 4, because table 4 shows the changes of different initial
folic acid concentration with time, when it was drawn into the same figure, it would
result in inconsistent figure because the initial concentration of the larger gap.
17. Figure 5 is not required.
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. The figure shows the initial concentration of folic
acid from 200 mg/L to 1100 mg/L variation with the increase of time which could
conclud that when the initial concentration of folic acid was low, it is beneficial to the
degradation reaction of folic acid, so we think it is necessary to retain.
18. Hydrogen peroxide generation at various experimental conditions can be
provided.
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. The experiments were carried out under different
experimental conditions. The orthogonal experiment was carried out in detail. The
following reaction kinetics was mainly aimed at the study of the order of the
degradation reaction of folic acid, so it was carried out under the optimum conditions.
19. Folic acid measurement method is required. Instruments used for the study is need
to be added.
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. The folic acid was analyzed by UV
spectrophotometry (L5S). Concentrations of folic acid in adsorption experiments were
determined at a wavelength of 281 nm at pH 6.8. in § 2.4.
20. Compare optimal conditions with other articles.
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. Because of few literatures about the treatment of
folic acid wastewater by electric Fenton, we only compared the relevant literatures on
the treatment of organic wastewater by electro Fenton, and have modified the relevant
content in the text.
21. Language corrections are required.
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. The language is further amended.
Reviewer #2:
1. In the introduction section, Fenton oxidation can be briefly described. Besides, the
electro- Fenton process should be introduced in detail. Some newly emerging
Fenton-like technologies should also be described (e.g., Journal of Power Sources
2015, 291,108-116; Water Res. 2017, 119:67-72).
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. Taking into account of the reviewer’s instruction,
we described the electro-Fenton in detail after reading the references provided by
reviewers (Zhang Y, Wang Y, Angelidaki I. Alternate switching between microbial
fuel cell and microbial electrolysis cell operation as a new method to control H2O2,
level in Bioelectro-Fenton system[J]. Journal of Power Sources, 2015, 291:108-116.
2. Page2,line 33-36: A series of chain Fenton reactions should be introduced in detail.
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. A series of chain Fenton reactions are written in
detail. We have described the electro-Fenton in detail and modified in the text.
3. The references (reference [7],[23]) in the tense need to be consistent.
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. The references in the tense have been corrected.
4. Page22, table: The characteristics of PAC and LC-MS (page17, Figure 3a) can be
shown in supplementary material.
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. We have moved the table of the characteristics of
PAC and the figure of LC-MS into the supplementary material.
5. Page5, line37-39: Please check the sentence“The sample were filtered under the
condition...”
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. The sentence has been corrected in the text.
6. Page6, line12-24: The description of PAC in results and discussion can be moved
to materials and methods section.
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. The description of PAC in results and discussion
have be moved to materials and methods section.
7. Page8, line48-50: Please check the sentence“The date in table4...”
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. The sentence has been corrected in the text.
8. Page9: Make a brief summary of the conclusion (and the advantages of
three-dimensional electrode could be described in introduction).
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. The three-dimensional electrode have been
described in introduction and summaried the conclusion briefly.
9. Please keep consistent fomat for reference.( reference[1][2][11][17][19][24][30])
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. We have carefully checked the references and
modified the errors..
Reviewer #3:
Introduction
1. Please cite a reference for the statement “wastewater is one of the most polluting
effluents produced by the pharmaceutical processing”
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we
changed the sentence and the exact description of this sentence is “Folic acid
wastewater is one of the most polluting effluents produced by the pharmaceutical
processing” and a reference is quoted to support this sentence.
2. Precise RhB=Rhodamine B
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. The words have been corrected in the text.
3. Which kind of modified cathode was used by Liu[24] p.3
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. The modified cathode was n-doped graphite felt
and the sentence is rewritten. Liu et al. found that n-doped graphite felt showed a
significant improvement of degradation of levofloxacin, TOC removal can reach a
92% at 200 mA for 480 min, which was higher than unmodified one at twice the
current.
4. You should add some information about folic acid degradation actual knowledge
and the interest of your kinetic study in the introduction
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. We have described the electro-Fenton in detail
and modified in the text. As follow, in the reaction system, under the acidic condition,
the cathode oxygen reacts with the hydrogen ion, and the reaction generates H2O2.
The H2O2 and the addition of the Fe2+ reacts to generate ·OH and a series of chain
reactions. Then Fe3+ regenerates to Fe2+.
Materials and methods
5. Statistical analyses are brought up in Author’s contribution, although they are not
presented in the materials and methods section, they should be presented. How many
repetitions were performed for each condition? Error bars are missing on graphs (Fig
1,2,4,5,6). It is difficult (or even statistically inappropriate) to compare results without
standard deviations.
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. We considered the statistical analyses all results
of this experiment are repeated three times, taking the average value to the final result.
The figures are shown in the text added error bars. Since the kinetics fitting can not be
expressed directly by the error bars in the graph, the average value is fitted and the
folic acid concentration changes with time have been modified.
6. §2.3 some imprecisions:“the desired amount of 1.5g/l” this concentration is
variable (0,0.5,1,1.5g/L) “a certain amount of FeSO4” isn’t it always 1mM?
Ans: Thank you for you suggestion. The amount of PAC is an important parameter in
the Electro-Fenton three dimensional electro-Fenton, so we varied the concentration
of PAC and choose a optimal concentration. While, about the amount of FeSO4, we
determined it according to reference[29], because it is the lowest undesirable iron
sludge. According to Figure 2, we determined the dosage of PAC (1.5g/l). According
to reference[29], we determined that the certain amount of FeSO4 is 0.1 mM<U+3002>
7. §2.4 LCMS description is incomplete : which are the elution conditions (isocratic
or gradient, proportion of each mobile phase…..), type of analyser used for the MS?
Ans:Thank you for your suggestion. We have revised the description on LCMS which
was shown in part 2.4. LC-MS analytical method.
8. You should add some paragraph dealing with COD determination, method used,
number of analysis per sample, results uncertainty (could be used as error bars for the
graphics).
Ans:. Thank you for your suggestion. The pretreatment of COD determination is in
the second paragraph of 2.3 part. The pretreatment steps include static, adjusting pH
and filtering. And the method of COD determination is referring to the standard of HJ
828-2017 in China, which has been added at the end of the second paragraph of 2.3
part. What’s more, the statistical analyses of all results of this experiment are
repeated three times, taking the average value to the final result, and finally we draw
the figures as you recommend.
9. You should add a paragraph on your 44 orthogonal test and explain how you have
obtained K and R values and their meanings.
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. We introduce in detail the orthogonal experiment
in the text. The orthogonal design is a design method of multi factors and multi levels,
it is based on the orthogonality selected from comprehensive test of some
representative point test, orthogonal test design is the main method of fractional
factorial design. The K value is the sum of the experimental results corresponding to
each factor, and R is the difference between the maximum value of K and the
minimum value for each factor.
Results and discussion
10. Results are often only presented without further discussion.
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. We have made a further discussion about the
results and discussion.
11. §3.1 is the third electrode really necessary? PAC 0g/L allows also a good COD
reduction in 12h. One may wonder whether the results at 120 min are really (I mean
statistically) different between PAC 0 and 1.0g/l
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. The third electrode has a large specific surface
area, which can increase the aspect ratio of the electrolytic cell. The particle spacing is
small and the material mass transfer rate is high. The space-time conversion
efficiency is high and the larger current density can be provided at a lower current
density. Using of electricity Fenton or PAC adsorption alone, COD removal rate is
very high in the first, but the removal is difficult to improve, it is difficult to reach the
standard, The use of three-dimensional electrodes can avoid this problem.
12. § 3.2 According to the K values does a current of 10.26 mA/cm2 really
(statistically…) give better results than 7.36mA/cm2? All these K and R values have
units (mg/l I suppose). You should add conclusions with regard to the R values.
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. The k is the average of certain factor and level,
can be used to determine the global optimal extraction condition and R is the range of
K, which can show the effect of a certain factor on the removal efficiency. The best
condition is determined by the value of the k1,k2,k3,k4.
13. §3.3 How were the degradation products identified? (mass spectra? Retention
times of standards?)
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. The degradation products were identified by
LC-MS and the products were identified in Fig.3. It is mainly determined by
comparing with the reference material in the literature.
14. §3.4 the interest of the kinetic study should be highlighted §3.4.1 is part of 3.4.2 :
the reported values are the same for the COD value of 1039… This is confusing. One
could believe that the 3.4.1 experiment was performed on experimental raw water
with a COD of 1041 (§2.1) and the 3.4.2 experiment on simulated folic acid waste
water.
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. In order to make the chemical reaction apply to
the production and achieve the ideal reaction speed we have studied the reaction
kinetics. the concentration of simulated folic acid wastewater are 1100 mg/L, 800
mg/L, 500 mg/L and 200 mg/L respectively were applied in the reaction kinetics
(3.4.2) and the orthogonal experiment is directly from folic acid plant.
15. Results in table 4 are inconsistent with the 1/c values in the file “supporting data”
for c0=800mg/l (2 first values inconsistent) and c0=500mg/l (6 values in the row are
incoherent).
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. Table 4 shows the variation of COD
concentration of folic acid wastewater with the passage of time, and the simulation of
kinetics is 1/c with the passage of time, so the numerical value is inconsistent.
General remarks
16. Modify : “air” sparge rate is different from “oxygen” sparging rate in table 2
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. We have modified the oxygen sparging rate to
air sparge rate in the text.
17. Figure captions sometimes inaccurate for example Fig 1 PAC 10g??? 1.5g/l in the
text Fig 2 reaction time varies : remove “reaction time = 120 min”, the current density
is only 2.64mA/cm2, remove 0mA/cm2……
Ans: Thank you for your suggestion. Figure captions are modified per suggestion of
reviewer. Fig 1 is to eliminate the adsorption effect of PAC to study the degradation
effect of PAC as an electrode for folic acid wastewater. Fig. 2 is to determine the
optimum dosage of PAC.
