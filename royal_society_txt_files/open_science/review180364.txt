The author do well work on the major phenolics and their antioxidant contributions in ATL and
ATF with thermal treatments.
1. In section 3.2 Thermal treatments of ATL and ATF extracts, 15.30 mL of 66.20% ethanol was
added to 1.000 g air-dried and ground ATL or ATF powder, the author using 66.20% ethanol,
other solvents, such as water, 10% ethanol have been studied?
2. In Fig. 4( Figure captions), “Different letters means there exists significant difference.” Do you
mean p<0.05 or P<0.01? It should be signed.

Response to comments of Reviewers
Reply to Reviewer #1
Question 1: What experimental design are you used in the results in Table 2? You could
used an experimental design one way for each compound and comparison mean
technique as Tukey or Duncan´s.
Reply: Many thanks to the reviewer for his/her kind advise. As the matter of fact, we
did use Tukey’s HSD test in one-way ANOVA to determine the significant deference
for the results in Table 2. However, the method used in our previous research was
somehow mistakenly described in section 3.7 ‘Data analysis’ in the present manuscript.
Therefore, we changed the description ‘The statistical significance (t-test: two-sample
equal variance, using two-tailed distribution) was determined using SPSS software
(Version 22.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).’ into ‘The statistical significance was
determined by Tukey’s HSD test in one-way ANOVA using SPSS software (Version
22.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).’.
Reply to Reviewer #2
Question 1: In section 3.2 Thermal treatments of ATL and ATF extracts, 15.30 mL of
66.20% ethanol was added to 1.000 g air-dried and ground ATL or ATF powder, the
author using 66.20% ethanol, other solvents, such as water, 10% ethanol have been
studied?
Reply: Many thanks to the reviewer for his/her question. As indicated in section 3.2 in
the manuscript, the ultrasonic-assisted extraction procedure used in the present study
was optimized in one of our previous reports (cited as reference 14), in which we
investigated the appropriate concentration of extraction solvent to extract phenolics
from Acer truncatum leaves (ATL) with response surface methodology, and the optimal
result concerning the solvent is 66.20% ethanol. Therefore, 66.20% ethanol, instead of
water or 10% ethanol was used in the present study.
Question 2: In Fig. 4 (Figure captions), “Different letters means there exists significant
difference.” Do you mean p < 0.05 or P < 0.01? It should be signed.
Reply: As described in section 3.7 ‘Data analysis’, all significant deference in the
manuscript means p < 0.05. And we have added detailed definition (P < 0.05) in the
figure caption of Fig.4 in the manuscript to make it easier for readers to understand.
