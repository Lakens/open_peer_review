This manuscript is concerned with a proposed homeotic shift in the anterior vertebral column of
early turtles. I agreed to review this article because I thought that it would mostly pertain to
paleontology, my area of expertise, but given the heavy emphasis on gene expression, this paper
is partially outside my comfort zone. I therefore here focus my review on paleontological aspects,
but strongly suggest that it be reviewed by at least one person more familiar with developmental
biology than myself.
All in all enjoyed reading this paper. The issue being discussed in certainly not new, but the
author combines recent insights into the fossil record of Triassic turtles and developmental
biology into an elegant model that supports the notion that the most anterior thoracic vertebra
turned into the most posterior cervical vertebra in the early turtle stem lineage.
Although it is apparent that the author is not a native speaker, the manuscript is generally well
written and could easily be edited by the production mean. I otherwise have a short list of
comments of varying importance:
line 25: I am quite sure that the vast majority of theropods, including birds, have more than 18
presacral vertebrae. Please check. The neck alone often has more than 18 presacrals.
line 46, and elsewhere: Two points: First, in the majority of extant vertebrates, the vertebral
column can cleanly be classified into functional zones (cervical, dorsal, sacral, caudal, etc.) that
we now know to be regulated by hox genes, but this appears to be the result of vertebral
specialization over the course of evolution, as the vertebral column of basal tetrapods shows
gradual changes between various functional zones. In other words, although the neck vertebrae
of basal tetrapods clearly have one shape and function and the dorsal vertebra another shape and
function, multiple vertebrae are apparent that grade from one zone to the next. This is why
people working on basal tetrapods have to use criteria when counting the vertebra of these
regions, which, however, leads to a somewhat artificial subdivision of the column. Different
criteria, however, will result in different vertebral counts. I would argue that the ninth pre-sacral
in basal turtles is an example of a vertebra that mediates between the neck and the thorax. The
author should therefore be clear that his characterization of this vertebra as a thoracic that
became a cervical may in part be contingent upon the criteria he uses and that his criteria are not
necessarily better than those of previous authors. Although I nevertheless agree with the
conclusion of the author, I suggest that he sometimes rethink his wordings to express a more
neutral stance. Second, as the vertebra in question is somewhat intermediate in its morphology, it
is not also possible that this is really a 'cervical vertebra' that was 'captured' by the shell, but freed
itself again? Somewhat ad hoc, but also possible.
line65: The statement regarding Polish law seems irrelevant and misplaced. I suggest leaving this
away completely.
line70: I fully agree with the author that an interpretation of what happened in turtle evolution is
conditional upon a tree. However, the documented homeotic shift occurs within Testudinata and
is apparently not informed by the outgroups. I therefore really do not see the point of the
phylogenetic analysis, especially given that the novel tree does not differ relative to those
previously proposed ones and also has no impact on the interpretation that the most anterior
thoracic turns into the most posterior cervical. I therefore strongly suggest shortening the paper
by removing the phylogenetic section, as its inclusion is highly distracting.
line79: If the authors insist on keeping the phylogenetic analysis, please note that I do not
understand what he did for the second set of analyses and why he used such complex searching
techniques. Again, I suggest leaving this all away as it seems irrelevant.
3
line 97: The author introduced the abbreviations PSV and TV earlier in the text, but by the time I
got to the result, I had forgotten them again. Perhaps introduce them again? I believe these are
not standard abbreviations familiar to the reader.
line 212: As I already stated above, I really do not see the point of the phylogenetic analysis, as it
does not inform the paper in any way. Once again, if the author insists of keeping the analysis, I
suggest leaving away the citation from Hirayama and Nakajima (2016), as this is a conference
abstract that most certainly will never be followed up by a real publication.
Figure 1: The author should highlight more clearly that the hoc gene expression he noted for the
fossil taxa are just hypothesized, not based on fact.
All in all, my suggestions are rather minor, with exception of exclusion of the phylogenetic
analysis, which I presume can be clipped from the manuscript easily. I therefore gladly
recommend publication of this contribution one these suggestions have been addressed.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The manuscript provides an interesting discussion on the potential genetic controllers of
vertebral column development during early turtle evolution by using recent advancements in the
study of Hox-gene regulations of amniote morphology as analogy. Besides, it provides a revised
morphological phylogenetic analysis of potential turtle ancestors and with insights into the data
support of earlier hypotheses of turtle origins. These are the two most important contributions of
the manuscript and these should be published.
I suggest a few ways of improvement. In generak, I feel the hypotheses are too simplistic (one
sided) and alternatives are not taken into account. Specifically, the morphological hypothesis has
to be re-evaluated which in turn may have implications for the conclusions regarding the genetic
background of the transition.
1) Much of the results section is actually a discussion (at least all the discussion about Hox-genes).
The paper should be restructured. More problematic is that the phylogenetic discussion is
currently very distantly related to the rest of the paper. I can guess what the link is but the author
4
should make clear in the discussion how his phylogenetic analysis is linked to the discussion of
morphological evolution, perhaps the genetic controllers. In the current state this looks more like
two separate, not tightly related discussions combined into a single paper. Moreover, the
implications of the phylogeny for the morphological evolutionary hypotheses are lacking.
2) The transitional morphology present in Proganochelys has been known for a long time and is
not a new inference (see below). Please make sure that this comes through clearly in the
manuscript because based on the current phrasing I am afraid the casual reader may
(erroneously) find that this observation is the result of the present study. I suspect the author did
not intend to claim this as his result but the paragraph in question nevertheless has to be
rephrased.
3) A serious problem is that Proterocheris robusta SMNS 17757 specimen/taxon (and the unfused
CV8-TV1 condition it shows) is ignored in the evolutionary scenario provided in the manuscript.
It is also excluded from the figure where the evolution of the cervical region is illustrated. If this
taxon is indeed a proterochersid then how does the author fit the unfused cervical 8 into the
proposed evolutionary scenario (in Fig. 1)? Either (1) the potential fusion is an autapomorphy of
P. porebensis or (2) SMNS 17757 is not a proterochersid (the group is paraphyletic) or (3) the
derived condition was independently acquired in SMNS 17757. In any case, the author should
avoid cherry-picking the results because each of these scenarios are equally parsimonious. Even if
Proterochersidae is monophyletic, the author cannot objectively decide the plesiomorphic
condition (SMNS 17757 or the potentially fused condition in Proterochersis porebensis, see
further issues with the interpretation of the morphology of this taxon below). This is the weak
point of the paper and this issue might have implications for the inference on the evolution of
Hox-gene expressions.
4) The ms should be revised for spelling mistakes and the wording should be ideally improved
by a native speaker.
Detailed comments:
Page 2: Carnian: biologist readers may not know that this is in the Late Triassic.
Odontochelys: does the author agree with the formula described for this species? Or do the
preservation of specimens allow the observation of the formula at all?
Proterochersidae and Eunotosaurus are missing author references.
“…may form a sutural contact…” – I believe you mean the variation present in Proganochelys.
“may form…” however is unclear, please be explicit about variation.
I think turtles do not have thoracic vertebrae. Instead, they should be called dorsal vertebrae.
The description and illustration of the cervical – thoracic contact in the description of
Proterochersis porebensis (Szczygielski & Sulej, 2016) is difficult to verify. The photo provided by
Szczygielski & Sulej (2016) is too small and the vertebrae are only visible in one (ventral) view.
Moreover, the specimen is not prepared well enough to check if the vertebra in question is fused
to the carapace (as the author claims). I don’t think one can tell this since the matrix is simply
obscuring the relevant region. Please provide more detailed close up photos of these vertebrae in
the current submission (also in dorso-lateral view) and check carefully if further preparation
could yield new insights into the contact between the vertebrae and with the carapace. No new
documentation of this specimen is provided in the current submission. On page 5, the author
mentions “in all specimens”. There is only one illustrated in (Szczygielski & Sulej, 2016) showing
the condition in question. Please list and illustrate the others.
Another problem is that as long as only a single specimen is showing the fused vertebrae (if the
interpretation is correct) it is difficult to rule out that the condition in this specimen is due to
preservational artefact. I suggest being open about this alternative. Perhaps the two vertebrae
plastically deformed during fossilization and ended up looking like they are fused? Please
consider this explanation.
5
Even if the anatomical interpretation is correct, one can not exclude that the fusion is ontogeny
related since there are too few specimens. In Proterocheris robusta SMNS 17757 (the author
named this specimen as a new genus and species in an earlier paper) cervical eight and dorsal 1
are not fused. Isn’t this specimen also smaller in size (and perhaps representing an earlier
ontogenetic stage)? The description of this specimen by Joyce et al (2013) is not cited in the
submission and this should be added.
Page 3: Methods.
Paragraph about fieldwork and Polish law does not seem relevant for this paper. I suggest
deleting these from the ms.
Page 4: “every possible combination…” This is unclear, please be more explicit and clarify.
“turtle-Eunotosaurus, turtle-Pappochelys clade…” Are these two different topologies? Or one of
these taxa was considered closer to turtles?
“Then I tried to find the highest possible support…” This is hard to follow, please rephrase and
clarify. How is this different from finding “the most optimal K-value in terms of support…” ?
“beneficial taxon combinations…” I have a vague idea what the author could mean but this is
unclear and should be rephrased for more explicit meaning.
“I removed the characters…” You have to be explicit about that the characters listed here are the
ones supporting the turtle-Eunotosaurus clade.
“…the unsatisfying tree resolution…” Not clear, no earlier reference to this problem.
I am not sure if removing a taxon is the way to check its impact on topology. Instead, I suggest
using the pruning option implemented in TNT.
Page 5:
“For that reason I advocate that PSV8 in Proterochersis spp still belonged to the thoracic
section…”
Based on morphology alone whether a vertebra is part of the neck or the thoracic region is merely
a question of convention and cannot be objectively decided. We use definitions for “cervical”,
“thoracic”, “sacral” etc. but when the morphology of a vertebra is transitional and therefore fits a
combination of these definitions then one can only subjectively label a vertebra as “thoracic” or
“cervical” (if morphology and anatomical position are the only information available). In this
regard, this question is no more than a semantic issue.
“I interpret this morphology as intermediate between the typical dorsal and cervical.”
The fact that different authors had different interpretation of this vertebra illustrates well that this
is not a new observation: because of its transitional morphology people have been puzzled
whether they should call it a thoracic or a cervical vertebra. Please make sure that you emphasize
this and also make sure it does not look like that this is the result of your study.
Page 6:
“The spreading apart of the expression ranges of Hox-5 and Hox-6…” This is hard to follow
because there is no earlier reference to “spreading apart” of these gene expressions. How does the
author know that spreading occurred during the evolution of turtles? Are you sure they show a
more derived expression range relative the plesiomorphic condition in amniotes?
Page 7:
The author cites experiments on mice and chicken for supporting his turtle evolutionary
hypothesis but in the preceding page we are told that the expression ranges of Hox-genes are
6
actually quite variable among amniotes. Does the author perhaps see an internal controversy in
the lines of logics in his arguments in this case?
Page 8:
“… marginal count is shifted… +1…”
+1 is unclear even though I think I understand what you mean. Please rephrase.
“Interestingly, in Keuperotesta limendorsa, …”
I probably follow your logics here but I would welcome if you could complete your idea to assure
full clarity.
Yours sincerely,
Márton Rabi

Both reviewers find this manuscript interesting, but do suggest some revisions should be made.
For example, both reviewers highlight that the phylogenetic section is poorly integrated with the
paper as a whole. One suggests removing this phylogeny section completely, whilst the other
reviewer suggests accommodating it more clearly by modifications to the text. I leave it up to the
authors to choose which path of action they prefer. Both reviewers also highlighted that the
discussion of vertebrae classification, and how this classification has certain ambiguities about
transitional morphologies and fusion status that impact on the conclusions drawn, needs further
explanation and clearer accommodation into the discussion of the results and conclusions. If the
extra documentation of Proterochersis porebensis that the second reviewer suggests can be
provided then this will obviously be a significant improvement to the manuscript.

The manuscript provides an interesting discussion on the potential genetic controllers of

Based on morphology alone whether a vertebra is part of the neck or the thoracic region is merely

“thoracic”, “sacral” etc. but when the morphology of a vertebra is transitional and therefore fits a

“The spreading apart of the expression ranges of Hox-5 and Hox-6…” This is hard to follow
because there is no earlier reference to “spreading apart” of these gene expressions. How does the
author know that spreading occurred during the evolution of turtles? Are you sure they show a
more derived expression range relative the plesiomorphic condition in amniotes?
Page 7:
The author cites experiments on mice and chicken for supporting his turtle evolutionary
hypothesis but in the preceding page we are told that the expression ranges of Hox-genes are
12
actually quite variable among amniotes. Does the author perhaps see an internal controversy in
the lines of logics in his arguments in this case?
Page 8:
“… marginal count is shifted… +1…”
+1 is unclear even though I think I understand what you mean. Please rephrase.
“Interestingly, in Keuperotesta limendorsa, …”
I probably follow your logics here but I would welcome if you could complete your idea to assure
full clarity.
Yours sincerely,

and/or new Figure 2 may be moved to the supplement.
Reviewer 1
ine 25: I am quite sure that the vast majority of theropods, including birds, have more than 18 presacral
ertebrae. Please check. The neck alone often has more than 18 presacrals.
This is of course true, but please notice the word “some” before “placodonts, ornithischians, birds, and
pterosaurs” indicating that I had on my mind only selected taxa representing these groups. Some (but probably
not all) of these taxa may be found in Supporting information to Müller et al., 2010 (Homeotic effects,
omitogenesis and the evolution of vertebral numbers in recent and fossil amniotes). Please correct me, if the
wording in that sentence is still ambiguous due my imperfect knowledge of English grammar.
ine 46, and elsewhere: Two points: First, in the majority of extant vertebrates, the vertebral column can
leanly be classified into functional zones (cervical, dorsal, sacral, caudal, etc.) that we now know to be
egulated by hox genes, but this appears to be the result of vertebral specialization over the course of
evolution, as the vertebral column of basal tetrapods shows gradual changes between various functional zones.
n other words, although the neck vertebrae of basal tetrapods clearly have one shape and function and the
dorsal vertebra another shape and function, multiple vertebrae are apparent that grade from one zone to the
next. This is why people working on basal tetrapods have to use criteria when counting the vertebra of these
egions, which, however, leads to a somewhat artificial subdivision of the column. Different criteria, however,
will result in different vertebral counts. I would argue that the ninth pre-sacral in basal turtles is an example of
a vertebra that mediates between the neck and the thorax. The author should therefore be clear that his
haracterization of this vertebra as a thoracic that became a cervical may in part be contingent upon the
riteria he uses and that his criteria are not necessarily better than those of previous authors. Although I
nevertheless agree with the conclusion of the author, I suggest that he sometimes rethink his wordings to
express a more neutral stance.
Actually, the criteria used by Jaekel, Gaffney, and me, are virtually the same (the main difference between
aekel and Gaffney is the emphasis on fusion to the following vertebra). It is the unusual anatomy of
Proganochelys quenstedti that made the classification under these criteria ambiguous. The main step forward
n the interpretation of that morphology is the notion, that in Proterochersis, which is older and more basal, the
morphology of the eighth presacral (PSV8) is at least as dorsal-like, as the morphology of the ninth presacral
PSV9) in modern turtles (which is considered a true dorsal vertebra) – and if we take the large, not reduced
ibs into account, even more dorsal-like. In other words, the identification of the eighth presacral as a dorsal
ertebra in Proterochersis is rather unambiguous, because it is based on the same criteria as the identification
of the first dorsal vertebra in modern turtles. Conclusion that one of them does not qualify as a dorsal vertebra
would automatically mean, that the other one does not either, and we know from the Hoxc-6 expression range
hat it does qualify.
The reasoning used historically is briefly discussed in lines 43-50 of corrected text, but I added the statement
about the blurriness of the vertebral region classification and which criteria were used by me to the Methods
ection. I also added the clarification for the identification of PSV8 in Proterochersis to the Results section.
Second, as the vertebra in question is somewhat intermediate in its morphology, it is not also possible that this
s really a 'cervical vertebra' that was 'captured' by the shell, but freed itself again? Somewhat ad hoc, but also
possible.
Similar interpretation was recently proposed by Walter Joyce for PSV9. This cannot be refuted with 100%
ertainty, but I think this is unlikely for several reasons, discussion of which I added to the text.
First of all, there are several turtle-exclusive oddities that may be explained by posterior migration of the
ervico-dorsal frontier: the expression of Hox-5 genes is restricted to the cervical region, the brachial plexus is
estricted to the cervical section, and the scapula-building somites are located in the cervical section. As
o I interpret them as a sign that plesiomorphically the cervico-dorsal limit in turtles was located more cranially.
Of course, one can always argue that all of these quite rapidly migrated anteriorly, when the PSV8 was
aptured by the shell, and never returned when it was freed, but this does not seem to be very parsimonious.
Secondly, the adaptive value of such a change appears to be none. The elongation of the neck at the expense of
hortening of the stiffened trunk appears to give animal several benefits: lightening of the trunk, lowering of
he number of articulations in the trunk (thus enhancing its stiffness and optimizing the stress resistance),
ncreasing of the head reach and range of movements (resulting in larger coverage during feeding and
potentially in slightly increased capabilities of active defense) and so on. On the other hand, I fail to see
benefits resulting from capturing of the cervical into the shell. This is, of course, speculative, but I just see this
hypothesis as unparsimonious and inadaptive. And if the condition in Proterochersis is autapomorphic, then the
dorsal-like characteristics of PSV8 in Proganochelys would have to be autapomorphic as well, which does not
eem very likely.
Thirdly, the reduction of the dorsal segments in turtles is a consistent trend that goes well beyond the Triassic.
The best example of that process is the exclusion of the anterior and posterior dorsal ribs from the carapace
and their subsequent reduction. There are ten costals in Proterochersis, nine in Proganochelys, and only eight
n modern turtles, and the rib of the ninth presacral participates fully in the carapace in Proterochersis, is
excluded from the carapace but still long and retains a wide articulation in Proganochelys, and subsequently
gradually decreases in size. It all fits into an elegant morphocline spanning across many millions of years. A
apid capture of the posterior cervical vertebra into the dorsal section to free it again soon after is just out of
place. This reasoning is supported by most of the phylogenetic analyses performed by me (in the others the
plesiomorphic condition is unknown, so they still do not refute my line of thought), and en masse with other
lues it forms a coherent image, I think.
Finally, the low cervical count (below 8) and high dorsal count (above 10) are plesiomorphic for Eureptilia. I
how this on a new figure (Fig. 2), which is based on the best resolved and best supported eureptile tree
analysis 92), but in other well-resolved topologies the situation is the same: turtles are located in a
phylogenetic environment suggesting that their ancestor had this plesiomorphic vertebral formula, which was
ost along the turtle stem.
ine65: The statement regarding Polish law seems irrelevant and misplaced. I suggest leaving this away
ompletely.
removed that section.
ine70: I fully agree with the author that an interpretation of what happened in turtle evolution is conditional
upon a tree. However, the documented homeotic shift occurs within Testudinata and is apparently not
nformed by the outgroups. I therefore really do not see the point of the phylogenetic analysis, especially given
hat the novel tree does not differ relative to those previously proposed ones and also has no impact on the
nterpretation that the most anterior thoracic turns into the most posterior cervical. I therefore strongly
uggest shortening the paper by removing the phylogenetic section, as its inclusion is highly distracting.
see the point to the phylogenetic analysis, because it supports the view that the reduction of dorsal vertebral
ount is not homologous for turtles and Eunotosaurus, which was proposed as a turtle ancestor but has a more
derived vertebral formula. Removing it would make it easy to dismiss my results based on the assumption that
Eunotosaurus had a shorter trunk than the turtles.
agree that the phylogenetic part grew quite big past the bare minimum needed (that is why it was mostly
moved to the supplement), but I think the resulting observations are interesting, expose some weaknesses of
he previous phylogenetic analyses, and are overall important for our understanding of the turtle origins,
herefore I would like to keep it. I tried to incorporate it better into the main text and added a new figure (Fig.
2) based on the analysis 92.
ine79: If the authors insist on keeping the phylogenetic analysis, please note that I do not understand what he
did for the second set of analyses and why he used such complex searching techniques. Again, I suggest leaving
his all away as it seems irrelevant.
homoplasy, in my view, is a major problem of the recent phylogenies and, as it turned out from my analyses,
he only characters that force the Eunotosaurus-turtle grouping may in fact be homoplastic. This set of analyses
trengthens my point.

esult, I had forgotten them again. Perhaps introduce them again? I believe these are not standard
abbreviations familiar to the reader.
added the explanations at the beginning of the Results section. I also changed the term “thoracic” into
dorsal” and thus “TV” into “DV”, following the suggestion of the second Reviewer.
ine 212: As I already stated above, I really do not see the point of the phylogenetic analysis, as it does not
nform the paper in any way. Once again, if the author insists of keeping the analysis, I suggest leaving away the
itation from Hirayama and Nakajima (2016), as this is a conference abstract that most certainly will never be
ollowed up by a real publication.
Hirayama and Nakajima (2016) provide some additional observations supporting the results that I obtained
rom my analyses, but not identical. The morphological observations presented there are rather
traightforward but on point and does not suffer from the concise form of abstract. I fear it would be impolite
not to acknowledge their work. I would prefer to keep this abstract in, even more so, if it will never turn into
omplete paper, unless the Editor decides to remove it.
Figure 1: The author should highlight more clearly that the hoc gene expression he noted for the fossil taxa are
ust hypothesized, not based on fact.
t was stated in the caption, that “The expression ranges of Hox-6 for the Triassic taxa are deduced from
morphology”. I changed Hox-6 to Hox genes (Hox-5 ranges are taken from modern turtles, but there is some
morphological reasoning for showing them like that on the figure, which is discussed in the text) and added
hypothetical” to make it 100% clear.
Dr. Márton Rabi (Reviewer 2)
1) Much of the results section is actually a discussion (at least all the discussion about Hox-genes). The paper
hould be restructured. More problematic is that the phylogenetic discussion is currently very distantly related
o the rest of the paper. I can guess what the link is but the author should make clear in the discussion how his
phylogenetic analysis is linked to the discussion of morphological evolution, perhaps the genetic controllers. In
he current state this looks more like two separate, not tightly related discussions combined into a single
paper. Moreover, the implications of the phylogeny for the morphological evolutionary hypotheses are lacking.
restructured the text, so the results and discussion are separate now and divided in several sections. I also
ntegrated the phylogenetic part more, and created an additional figure (Fig. 2) showing the topology of
Eureptilia based on the best resolved and best supported tree (analysis 92), the temporal ranges of the taxa,
and their vertebral formulae.
2) The transitional morphology present in Proganochelys has been known for a long time and is not a new
nference (see below). Please make sure that this comes through clearly in the manuscript because based on
he current phrasing I am afraid the casual reader may (erroneously) find that this observation is the result of
he present study. I suspect the author did not intend to claim this as his result but the paragraph in question
nevertheless has to be rephrased.
Both the observations and interpretations of the morphology of Proganochelys PSV (presacral vertebra) 8 as
either CV (cervical vertebra) 8 or DV (dorsal vertebra) 1, that were presented historically by other authors, are
learly referred in the Introduction, lines 43-50 of corrected text. At least to my knowledge, however, no one
nterpreted this vertebra as true transitional cervico-dorsal vertebra in course of evolutionary transformation.
n that aspect, I believe, this is the result of present study. Please correct me, if I am wrong. The interpretation
of PSV8 as DV1 in Proterochersis is entirely novel.
3) A serious problem is that Proterocheris robusta SMNS 17757 specimen/taxon (and the unfused CV8-TV1
ondition it shows) is ignored in the evolutionary scenario provided in the manuscript. It is also excluded from
he figure where the evolution of the cervical region is illustrated. If this taxon is indeed a proterochersid then
potential fusion is an autapomorphy of P. porebensis or (2) SMNS 17757 is not a proterochersid (the group is
paraphyletic) or (3) the derived condition was independently acquired in SMNS 17757. In any case, the author
hould avoid cherry-picking the results because each of these scenarios are equally parsimonious. Even if
Proterochersidae is monophyletic, the author cannot objectively decide the plesiomorphic condition (SMNS
17757 or the potentially fused condition in Proterochersis porebensis, see further issues with the
nterpretation of the morphology of this taxon below). This is the weak point of the paper and this issue might
have implications for the inference on the evolution of Hox-gene expressions.
The discussion of that matter was added to the text. In short, scenario 2 and scenario 3 does not nullify the
onclusions of that research (because neither of them refutes the plesiomorphic state in Proterochersis
porebensis and Prot. robusta) and scenario 1 appears to be unlikely based on the observations of the Hox
expression patterns and aspects of turtle anatomy. There exists an additional scenario: (4) the vertebrae of
Keuperotesta limendorsa were wrongly identified and the vertebra interpreted by Joyce et al. (2013) and
Szczygielski and Sulej (2016) as PSV8 may in fact be PSV7, and the real eighth vertebra is fused to the dorsal
ertebral column just like in Proterochersis. I did not see that when describing that taxon, but there are some
lues that could potentially support this. This would strengthen the hypothesis presented herein, because in
uch a case the ribs of PSV8 would probably articulate to the carapace. The vertebral column of SMNS 17757 is
not prepared in its entirety, unfortunately. I uploaded some close-up photographs of SMNS 17757 together
with photographs of Prot. porebensis as a supplement.

Odontochelys: does the author agree with the formula described for this species? Or do the preservation of
pecimens allow the observation of the formula at all? Proterochersidae and Eunotosaurus are missing author
eferences.
The full discussion of Odontochelys semitestacea is in the supplement, and short note about it is present in the
main text (lines 416-420 of the revised manuscript). In short, I do not agree with the published vertebral
ormula, I have doubts about the possibility of discerning the individual dorsal vertebrae in the holotype, but I
have some clues based on the other specimens, that there were more dorsal vertebrae.
Authorship for Eunotosaurus is present (line 27 of revised text), although it was missing for Euoplocephalus

think turtles do not have thoracic vertebrae. Instead, they should be called dorsal vertebrae.
Generally, this is correct. I changed all “thoracic” (and “TV”) into “dorsal” (“DV”) in the main text, figure, and
upplement, although many authors (including Gaffney) tend to use the former term (and I personally prefer it
over the latter – for one, because “dorsal” is usually used as a term of location, a dorsoventral qualifier,
meaning in most animals “on the top” or “upward”, and not used as an anterioposterior qualifier; using “dorsal
ertebrae” would then imply some “ventral vertebrae”, moreover “dorsal somite” is sometimes used in place
of “dorsal part of a somite”, and “dorsal ribs” and “ventral ribs” are indeed anatomical terms used for lower
ertebrates… It is confusing, but I agree, that is the convention).
The description and illustration of the cervical – thoracic contact in the description of Proterochersis porebensis
Szczygielski & Sulej, 2016) is difficult to verify. The photo provided by Szczygielski & Sulej (2016) is too small
and the vertebrae are only visible in one (ventral) view. Moreover, the specimen is not prepared well enough
ince the matrix is simply obscuring the relevant region. Please provide more detailed close up photos of these
ertebrae in the current submission (also in dorso-lateral view) and check carefully if further preparation could
ield new insights into the contact between the vertebrae and with the carapace. No new documentation of
his specimen is provided in the current submission. On page 5, the author mentions “in all specimens”. There
s only one illustrated in (Szczygielski & Sulej, 2016) showing the condition in question. Please list and illustrate
he others.
Of course, the specimens are listed and their photographs are uploaded as an additional supplement together
with photographs of Keuperotesta limendorsa.
Another problem is that as long as only a single specimen is showing the fused vertebrae (if the interpretation
s correct) it is difficult to rule out that the condition in this specimen is due to preservational artefact. I suggest
being open about this alternative. Perhaps the two vertebrae plastically deformed during fossilization and
ended up looking like they are fused? Please consider this explanation.
This is valid reasoning, but we have two specimens with well-preserved vertebral column and one with broken
irst dorsal vertebra but showing the top of the neural spine fused to the carapace, so I am sure, that there is
no mistake.
Even if the anatomical interpretation is correct, one can not exclude that the fusion is ontogeny related since
here are too few specimens. In Proterocheris robusta SMNS 17757 (the author named this specimen as a new
genus and species in an earlier paper) cervical eight and dorsal 1 are not fused. Isn’t this specimen also smaller
n size (and perhaps representing an earlier ontogenetic stage)? The description of this specimen by Joyce et al
2013) is not cited in the submission and this should be added.
Once again, that could be true, but does not seem to agree with observations. The holotype of Keuperotesta is
approximately the same size as the holotype of Proterochersis porebensis (the latter is ~42,5 cm long and SMNS
17757 is ~38,5 cm long, but it is missing a few centimeters of the posterior part of the carapace). Both are
arger than most specimens of Prot. robusta (the CSMM specimen is nearly their size). The last cervical appears
o be fused even in much smaller specimens of Prot. robusta (e.g. SMNS 16603 - ~32 cm long). I added this to
he discussion of Keuperotesta.
Of course, my oversight. I added the citation of Joyce et al. (2013).

am not sure if removing a taxon is the way to check its impact on topology. Instead, I suggest using the
pruning option implemented in TNT.
believe it is, otherwise no phylogenetic analysis performed to date would be valid, because we never have all
he taxa, never use all the taxa that we have, and with time new taxa are being added to old matrices to check
heir position and impact on topology. What I performed here, is based on the same reasoning, only inverted
i.e., we already have a dataset with many taxa, but I check how the matrix behaves without some of them,
because that was not tested previously). I think this is pretty straightforward. The exactly same method of
axon removal was also used, among others, by Brusatte et al., 2010 (The higher-level phylogeny of Archosauria
Tetrapoda: Diapsida)), Nesbitt, 2011 (The early evolution of archosaurs: relationships and the origin of major
lades), and Chen et al., 2014 (The enigmatic marine reptile Nanchangosaurus from the Lower Triassic of Hubei,
China and the phylogenetic affinities of Hupehsuchia).
plan on doing some turtle relationships-centered phylogenetic work soon, using different algorithms and
methods (including cladistics, stratocladistics, chronophyletics), and a better matrix (the taxon sampling in that
one is not the best possible, I am afraid) to compare results. I will then try to confront taxon removal with
axon pruning.
Page 5:
For that reason I advocate that PSV8 in Proterochersis spp still belonged to the thoracic section…”
Based on morphology alone whether a vertebra is part of the neck or the thoracic region is merely a question
of convention and cannot be objectively decided. We use definitions for “cervical”, “thoracic”, “sacral” etc. but
when the morphology of a vertebra is transitional and therefore fits a combination of these definitions then
one can only subjectively label a vertebra as “thoracic” or “cervical” (if morphology and anatomical position are
he only information available). In this regard, this question is no more than a semantic issue.
This is true, but PSV8 in Proterochersis does not have a transitional morphology. It does not differ in most
aspects from the first dorsal vertebra of modern turtles (it is immovable, contacts the carapace, and bears ribs),
and in some aspects (large ribs) is even more dorsal-like than in today’s species. Only in Proganochelys the
morphology is intermediate. Additionally, turtles are a bit easier in that regard, because they are still alive
oday, and – despite of all the differences and plesiomorphies seen in the Late Triassic turtles – the
morphological criteria of vertebrae identity may be (at least to an extent) verified on modern specimens. The
riteria used by me and other authors are listed in Methods section, and justification for this identification was
added to results.
I interpret this morphology as intermediate between the typical dorsal and cervical.”
The fact that different authors had different interpretation of this vertebra illustrates well that this is not a new
observation: because of its transitional morphology people have been puzzled whether they should call it a
horacic or a cervical vertebra. Please make sure that you emphasize this and also make sure it does not look
ike that this is the result of your study.
As stated earlier, while it is true that other researchers discussed the identity of that vertebra, my
nterpretation differs from theirs. Jaekel, Romer, and Hofstetter & Gasc interpreted this element as true dorsal
ertebra, and Gaffney and following authors were certain that it is a cervical. Their views are referenced in the
act an intermediate one. Only recently the studies on the homeotic regulation of vertebral column and turtle
anatomy and morphogenesis provided data that would support such a possibility. There is a difference
between acknowledging a difficult to interpret morphology, and interpreting it as transitional. I added a
eference to Jaekel and Gaffney, but my interpretation cannot be in full attributed to any of them.
Page 6: “The spreading apart of the expression ranges of Hox-5 and Hox-6…” This is hard to follow because
here is no earlier reference to “spreading apart” of these gene expressions. How does the author know that
preading occurred during the evolution of turtles? Are you sure they show a more derived expression range
elative the plesiomorphic condition in amniotes?
Yes. The function of Hox-6 in determination of the anterior limit of dorsal section of vertebral column is
eferred in lines 328-329 of the revised text. The fact of restriction of Hoxa-5 and Hoxb-5 to the cervical region
n contrast to archosaurs and mammals is referred and discussed in lines 337-342 of revised text.
Page 7: The author cites experiments on mice and chicken for supporting his turtle evolutionary hypothesis but
n the preceding page we are told that the expression ranges of Hox-genes are actually quite variable among
amniotes. Does the author perhaps see an internal controversy in the lines of logics in his arguments in this
ase?
There is no internal controversy, at least not more than in case of classical morphology and molecular
haracters, which also are variable. Firstly, I only stated that the range of Hoxa-5 is quite variable, not that all of
hem are totally random. Secondly, it is understandable that the expression ranges of Hox (which determine
he morphology of vertebrae) are varied among vertebrates – otherwise all vertebrates would have the same
ertebral formulae and similar morphology. Thirdly, that does not mean, that such comparisons are senseless.
Some Hox genes appear to be more or less variable when it comes to their expression ranges (but their
nfluence seems to be restricted to minor modifications and tweaks to the morphology of vertebrae; Hoxa-5
eems to be one of such genes), while others determine the ranges of whole vertebral sections (e.g. the
anterior limit of Hox-6 expression always corresponds to the beginning of the dorsal section of vertebral
olumn, Hoxd-10 marks a beginning of the lumbar section, Hoxd-11 is responsible for formation of the sacrum,
etc.), and ranges of some of them are quite conserved among vertebrates (e.g. Hoxb-5 always seems to span
across the cervical and dorsal section of vertebrae… with exception of turtles). Therefore, some ranges (or at
east their anterior limits) may be quite readily deduced from morphology and certainly the phylogenetic
bracketing may be used for Hox genes.

added a conclusion to my thought.
Changes to the supplement
<U+F0B7> I merged the result description and discussion of the phylogenetic analyses with the main text, so they are
removed from the supplement
<U+F0B7> I fixed some typos and grammatic errors
<U+F0B7> I changed “thoracic” and “TV” into “dorsal” and “DV”, and “TV0” into “PSV8” to keep it homogenous with
the main text
<U+F0B7> I added “R” to rib symbols in Supp. Table 1
<U+F0B7> I fixed the incorrect numbering of tables
<U+F0B7> I improved the table of contents by including each of the analyses with short descriptions of their settings
<U+F0B7> I added the missing parentheses above the trees for analyses 91 and 92
porebensis and Keuperotesta limendorsa. The DOI of the new data is http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.g5v64.
Older uploads may be removed (I am unable to do it myself, from what I see).
All the requested sections (Data Availability, Funding, etc.) are included in the manuscript.
Thank you for all the work needed to process this manuscript.
Yours sincerely,

Thank you very much for the decision. I corrected the manuscript according to the suggestions. The
abstract is revised, keeping in mind the word limit. The title of the section indicated by the Reviewer
s changed. I added the requested new figure (Fig. 2) and the caption. To keep the figure numbering in
accord with their appearance in the text, the phylogenetic tree is now figure 3.
attach the figures in EPS format, with exception of fig. 3, which is in PDF (TreeGraph 2 cannot export
he EPS files; I may provide it in PNG, TIF, or SVG, if needed). Figs. 1 and 3 are unmodified, except for
he plesiomorphic dorsal vertebral count for Squamata shown in fig. 3. The previous count of 71 dorsals
s unrealistically high, and is an artifact of the method used by Müller, 2011, resulting from the basal
position of Amphisbaenia in his trees. I decided to change it to more plausible 19 dorsals, following,
e.g., Talanda, 2017 (Evolution of postcranial skeleton in worm lizards inferred from its status in the
Cretaceous stem-amphisbaenian Slavoia darevskii). This change has no impact on interpretations
presented in my paper.
Once again, thank you very much for your work and your time.
Yours sincerely,
Tomasz Szczygielski
