The authors use a range of methods to conduct a taxonomic revision of an Australian agamid
genus (Tympanocryptus). They re-describe 2 existing species, and provide descriptions for 2 new
species. Importantly, they outline the conservation implications of their study, and discuss the
possibility that T. pinguicolla, last seen in 1967, is extinct.
This is a well-executed study, and undoubtedly contains the most comprehensive set of
approaches and analyses that I’ve ever seen for a species description. It is innovative with regard
to the wide range of methods employed (mtDNA, genomics, external morphology, CT scans),
and the sophistication with which the key taxonomic issues are addressed (identity of the
lectotype), and resolved. It is well-written, and clearly suitable for publication in the journal.
I only have 2 relatively minor comments on the MS.
1. The title should be revised to make it clear that it is potentially the first reptile extinction on
mainland Australia. This distinction is important to make, as there is one Christmas Island
species listed as Extinct, and another two listed as Extinct in the Wild.
2. Given, the presumed high conservation concern for all taxa within the genus, the authors
should provide the key information that will be needed for listing on the IUCN Red List (&
Australian EPBC Act; which uses the IUCN criteria). This includes known information on
population trends, population size, threats, estimated generation time, and geographic range
(extent of occurrence, area of occupancy). It would be great if the authors could even suggest a
potential Red List category for each species. This would fast-track subsequent Red Listing of
these new taxa, and revising existing listings for the redefined taxa.

This is an excellent revision of a group of Australian lizards. It is very much state of the art in
terms of the diversity and quality of the data collected and the modern treatment of those data.
This is also an important example paper about how basic and thorough taxonomic research can
have real world conservation implications. This is well known example in Australia and the
authors have done a great job with crushing the problem. I was particularly impressed with the
number of different data sets the authors used in their studies.
I think the paper is high quality in every way - the writing is clear and succinct, the figures and
tables are informative and attractive, and the taxonomic detail and presentation is impressive.
I have only one suggestion that the authors should consider. I did initially find reference to all
the Species A-G confusing and it wasn't until I had read some bits a couple of times that I
understood that Species A and B were to be designated as newly described species. That's OK,
but the thing I didn't like was the reference to all the other putative species C-G. You call them
"putative" species in the text sometimes but in the figures and in parts of the text you call them
species. You say that they are the subject of a separate taxonomic work, but I don't think you
gain anything by calling them species here. I think it would be safer to call all of these simply
Clades A-G, rather than species, and then say that Clades C-G are the subject of separate
taxonomic work. For these additional clades, you also did not have all the additional data, or do
species delimitation analyses, which further supports in my mind that you shouldn't call them
species here. Save that for the other paper. This is a very minor point and fixing it takes nothing
away from this paper. Well done!

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors use a range of methods to conduct a taxonomic revision of an Australian
agamid genus (Tympanocryptus). They re-describe 2 existing species, and provide
descriptions for 2 new species. Importantly, they outline the conservation implications
of their study, and discuss the possibility that T. pinguicolla, last seen in 1967, is extinct.
In reference to the last seen in 1967 statement in the paper. It has come to our attention from
one of the researchers on the recovery team for T. pinguicolla that there were two more high-
confidence sightings for this species in 1968 and 1969, published in a local naturalist journal.
Based on this we have updated the extinction analyses (dataset, methods and results section)
and tightened up the wording around high- confidence sightings versus low-confidence
sightings from 1988 and 1990. With these edits, including in the discussion, we make it clear
that the most recent sightings are not considered of high-confidence by the recovery team and
that further analyses, beyond the scope of our study, should incorporate survey effort and
available habitats.
This is a well-executed study, and undoubtedly contains the most comprehensive set of
approaches and analyses that I’ve ever seen for a species description. It is innovative
with regard to the wide range of methods employed (mtDNA, genomics, external
morphology, CT scans), and the sophistication with which the key taxonomic issues are
addressed (identity of the lectotype), and resolved. It is well-written, and clearly suitable
for publication in the journal.
I only have 2 relatively minor comments on the MS.
1. The title should be revised to make it clear that it is potentially the first reptile
extinction on mainland Australia. This distinction is important to make, as there is one
Christmas Island species listed as Extinct, and another two listed as Extinct in the Wild.
Title amended as requested.
2. Given, the presumed high conservation concern for all taxa within the genus, the
authors should provide the key information that will be needed for listing on the IUCN
Red List (& Australian EPBC Act; which uses the IUCN criteria). This includes known
information on population trends, population size, threats, estimated generation time,
and geographic range (extent of occurrence, area of occupancy). It would be great if the
authors could even suggest a potential Red List category for each species. This would
fast-track subsequent Red Listing of these new taxa, and revising existing listings for
the redefined taxa.
As requested we have added in a summary of available information for T. lineata and T.
osbornei on population declines, population size and information on trends. This has been
added into the remarks section of the taxonomic treatments. We have also provided
references that provide more details about these factors and the threats. Although we believe
this is important information for determining the conservation status of this species, we
believe that it beyond the scope of a taxonomic work to make decisions or recommendations
in regards to specific Red List categories for the species and that such decisions should be
made in consultation with the national recovery team. Such work will be undertaken by the
recovery team once the taxonomic revision has been published.

We see the logic of Reviewer 1’s suggestion and as such we have revised the mtDNA
phylogenetic section of the results. We now present just the information relevant to the
Grassland Earless Dragons, have revised the distribution map and removed the species
lettering from the tree. This information will be put into the second taxonomic paper on these
earless dragons, which will be submitted to Royal Society Open Science in the next couple of
weeks. We believe that these changes provide a better focus for the paper, taking out
somewhat irrelevant details that may distract the reader. And as the reviewer suggests, these
changes to not detract from the paper or lessen its importance.
