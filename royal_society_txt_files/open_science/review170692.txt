26 Abstract
4
5
6 27 The intensive use of synthetic pesticides in cowpea storage has led to the development of
7
8 28 resistance by Callosobruchus maculatus and subsequent degradation of the grains quality. In an
9
10
11
29 attempt to circumvent these constraints, we investigated the susceptibility of C. maculatus to 2,
12
13 30 3-Dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate (DDVP) and Lippia adoensis essential oil (EO) and then
14
15 31 assessed the variations in the proportions of nutritional values of treated grains 150 days after
16
17
18 32 storage. The survival rate was recorded after 5 generations. The resistance index and biochemical
19
20 33 parameters of grains were determined. The survival rate (SR) and resistance index (RI 50 and RI95)
21
22 34 significantly increased proportionally with damage in DDVP treatments (r=0.889; p=0.018)
23
24
25 35 while in EO treatments, those values remained low without significant variations (p=0.0764)
26
27 36 throughout the generations. DDVP stored grains yielded higher crude protein values, but lower
28
29
37 carbohydrates, tannins, phenolics and minerals compared to EO. Eighteen amino acids were
30
31
32 38 detected in EO treated grains and 14 in DDVP which was devoid of albumin and prolamin.
33
34 39 Lippia adoensis EO could therefore represent a safe alternative bio-pesticide to cope with the
35
36
37 40 insect resistance and enhance the nutritional qualities of stored cowpea seeds.

49 1. Introduction
4
5
6 50 Cowpea, Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. (Fabales: Fabaceae) is an economically legume
7
8 51 believed to have originated from Sub-Saharan Africa [1,2]. Cowpea is of paramount importance
9
10
11
52 to the survival of low-income farmers in Africa and is consumed in many forms throughout the
12
13 53 year [3]. It potentially contributes to poverty alleviation and reduction of food deficiency in
14
15 54 Africa. In Cameroon, it is an important source of plant protein for humans and livestock [3,4]
16
17
18 55 and contributes to soil fertility [5-7]. Furthermore, cowpea is well adapted to the stressful
19
20 56 climatic conditions of tropical Africa as it can tolerate drought and warm weather [8,9]. As such,
21
22 57 it could be grown in tropical and sub-tropical regions [4]. The far-north region of Cameroon
23
24
25 58 produces about 80% of the country’s cowpea output [4]. However, the floods that occur in 2012
26
27 59 destroyed large farmlands leading to decrease in production [10]. This coupled with Boko Haram
28
29
60 terrorist attacks and the immigration of refugees from neighboring Nigeria and Central African
30
31
32 61 Republic [10], has led to an increased in cowpea demand. Therefore there is a need to boost
33
34 62 cowpea production and limit postharvest losses.
35
36
37 63 Callosobruchus maculatus F. (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) is a field-storage pest of cowpea as
38
39 64 its infestation starts on the dried mature pods in the field [11]. It causes serious qualitative and
40
41 65 quantitative damages to the grains [12-14]. The adult is harmless as it does not feed, but lays
42
43
44 66 eggs on the grains which later hatch and penetrate into the seed cotyledons[8], where the larvae
45
46 67 and pupae develop and could completely damage seed viability and nutritional quality [15-17].
47
48
68 Till date, chemical pesticides are mainly used to minimize insect damage during storage [18-20].
49
50
51 69 The misuse of these pesticides has led to environmental hazards, health concerns and the
52
53 70 development of insect resistance. [21-23].

71 In order to ensure food security and overcome malnutrition, hunger and poverty in Sub-
4
5
6 72 Saharan Africa, it is of utmost importance to enhance cowpea production to meet up with the
7
8 73 rising African population [10]. Cost-effective control strategies that could efficiently limit the
9
10
11
74 cowpea infestation and enhance the nutritional and market values of the stored grains is the way
12
13 75 forward to cope with these challenges. Several studies have been carried out to understand the
14
15 76 beneficial effects of plant materials in protecting cowpea against C. maculatus infestation and
16
17
18 77 their ability to reduce the resistance of this pest [4,12,22,24]. However, much food safety related
19
20 78 questions still need to be addressed as far as the storage is concerned. For example, what is the
21
22 79 long term nutritional cost and benefit of storing cowpea with synthetic insecticide such as 3-
23
24
25 80 Dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate (DDVP) and plant essential oil (EO)? Could Lippia adoensis
26
27 81 EO be used as supplement to optimize the nutritional capacity of grains? The present study was
28
29
82 designed on one hand, to evaluate the responses of wild and laboratory populations of C.
30
31
32 83 maculatus to EO and DDVP and, on the other hand, to assess the variations in the nutritional
33
34 84 constituents of the cowpea seeds over a storage period of 150 days. Conventional methods have
35
36
37 85 been used for physiological and biochemical analysis. The data have been processed and the
38
39 86 results are discussed.

33
34 130 (1-2 days old) of C. maculatus were introduced into the different treatment containers and
35
36
37 131 covered with a mesh lid. Four replications were set for each treatment. Four replications were set
38
39 132 for each treatment. The adult mortality was assessed at 1, 2, 4 and 6 days after exposure (DAE).
40

15 167 magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, zinc, copper, iron, manganese, selenium, and sodium, Sulfur,
16
17
18 168 Boron, and Cobalt using classical procedures[29-31]. Briefly, the crude fat was extracted by
19
20 169 Soxhlet extraction with diethyl ether; crude ash by incineration in a carbolite furnace at 600°C
21
22 170 for 8h and cooled at room temperature; crude protein by the Kjeldahl method [32], quantified

25 171 and calculated as N×6.25; the moisture gravimetrically, and dietary fiber by a chemical-
26
27 172 gravimetric method with fibre analyzer ANCOM 220 (ANKOM Technology, USA) and the
28
29
173 means reported on dry weight basis [33-36]. The carbohydrate was estimated by Anthrone’s

11
187 O2O9) that aims at designing, separating, detecting and quantifying free, acidic, neutral and
12
13 188 basic amino acids of the hydrolysate [43,44]. The protein quality was estimated by determining
14
15 189 the total amino acids (TAA), the essential amino acids (EAA), the chemical score (CS), the
16
17
18 190 essential amino acids index (EAAI), the net protein value (NPV) as previously reported [45]. The
19
20 191 contents of different amino acids were presented as a percentage of the content of the same
21
22 192 amino acid in the standard protein and expressed as g/16g of Nitrogen to the equivalent of
23
24
25 193 g/100g protein on dry weight basis[46-48]. Scoring pattern for schoolchildren (10-12 years old)

29
218 transformed and the progressive number of progenies was log-transformed. The transformed data
30
31
32 219 were later subjected to one way ANOVA at probability of 0.05 and mean separation was done
33
34 220 using Duncan's Multiple Range Test (DMRT), where significance difference existed. The
35
36
37 221 concentration of DDVP and EO needed to evoke 50% (LC50) and 95% (LC95) mortality of C.
38
39 222 maculatus at every generation after treatment application was determined using probit analysis
40
41 223 [57]. All analyses were carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 20.0
42
43
44 224 software package. Graphs were constructed using OriginPro version 8.5.1. Based on the lethal
45
46 225 concentrations (LC), the resistance index (RI) of each generation was calculated as previously

26
27 240 3.1.1. Variations in adult mortality
28
29
241 The responses of C. maculatus to EO and DDVP varied with increasing concentrations
30
31
32 242 and generations. The adults mortality increased proportionally with the concentrations of DDVP
33
34 243 within generations but decreased between generations (r=-0879; P=0.0287) except in control
35
36
37 244 groups (Figure 1, black arrow). Meanwhile, the susceptibility of C. maculatus to EO remained
38
39 245 likely constant throughout generations (r=0.296; P=0.0532) (Figure 1B, red circle) although
40
41 246 slight increase over generation was recorded. The drastic reduction in adult mortality from the 3 rd
42
43
44 247 generation indicates an increasing tolerance of bruchids to DDVP (p=0.018) (Figure 1A). The
45
46 248 laboratory populations were the most susceptible to both pesticides.

4
5
6 254 laboratory populations. However, these parameters remained lower and did not vary significantly
7
8 255 in EO (p=0.0764) over generations (Table 1). Our results showed that the toxicity of DDVP was
9
10
11
256 inversely proportional to generations whereas in EO, it remained slightly constant over
12
13 257 generations (Figure 1; Table 1).

22
23
261 The significant damage in infested grains significantly altered almost all the nutritional
24
25
26 262 parameters of grains. The nutritional compounds were higher in EO treatments compared with
27
28 263 the control (18.40±1.17, 23.24±0.78 and 36.29±0.43 g/100g dry weight (dw), respectively)
29
30
31
264 (Figure 3, up-ray arrows). However, the crude protein content in DDVP treatments was higher
32
33 265 than in EO (26.18±0.92 and 19.74±1.88 g/100g dw, respectively) (Figure 2). The DDVP and the
34
35 266 infested grains both recorded a significant reduction (p=0.02213) in fat, ash, fiber, phenolic and
36
37
38 267 tannin contents whereas the moisture content in DDVP treatments generally compared with the
39

49
272 were the most dominant macro-elements in all treatments. They were more found in EO treated
50
51
52 273 cowpea with about 35.17% increase compared with the standard (Table 3) whereas in DDVP
53
54 274 treatments they decreased by 65.02%. The micro-elements Iron and Selenium were highly
55
56
57
275 represented in the standard but their amounts significantly decreased in DDVP treatments.

11
279 EO and non-treated grains and fourteen (14) in DDVP treatments. The amino acids Isoleucine,
12
13 280 Methionine, Phenylalanine, Arginine and protein fractions albumin and prolamin were missing
14
15 281 (Table 3, Figure 3). The concentrations of 6 amino acids (Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan,
16
17
18 282 Histidine, Arginine and Glutamate) significantly increased (p=0.028) in EO treated cowpea seeds
19
20 283 alongside with globulin and glutelin compared with the standard cowpea. Numerical amounts of

34 289 storage conditions were also observed in protein fractions under different storage conditions.
35
36
37 290 Globulin was the most abundant fraction recoreded in all the treatments, followed by glutelin in
38
39 291 standard and EO. Albumin and Glutelin were not detected in the damaged cowpea seeds whereas
40
41 292 in the DDVP treated seeds, the missing fractions were albumin and prolamin (Table 3).

51 296 calculation included the use of FAO/WHO/UNU [49] requirement pattern. The variation of the
52
53 297 nutritional parameters in the four treatments is presented in Table 4. Proteins derived from EO

299 4. Discussion
4
5
6 300 The results from this study revealed that the susceptibility of C. maculatus varied with
7
8 301 the type of insecticides, concentrations and with generations. The significant decrease in the
9
10
11
302 mortality, fecundity and pupal eclosion rates over generations in wild populations of bruchids
12
13 303 exposed to DDVP indicates ability to adapt and tolerate different concentrations of DDVP from
14
15 304 one generation to another, thus leading to the development of resistance. However, no significant
16
17
18 305 variations in the mortality were observed in EO treatments except the number of eggs and the
19
20 306 resulting adults that slightly decreased.
21
22 307 The established laboratory populations were the most susceptible with the highest
23
24
25 308 mortality in all treatments. This could be because they have never been exposed to DDVP and
26
27 309 therefore have not developed resistance to this insecticide. The cowpea seeds were collected
28
29
310 from a locality where DDVP is intensively being used by farmers before bagging the cowpea
30
31
32 311 seeds for storage. Unfortunately, their repeated misuse and over-dosage have led to the
33
34 312 development of resistance which was progressively acquired with the exposure to DDVP over
35
36
37 313 several generations. Previous studies have reported the acquisition of resistance to synthetic
38
39 314 insecticides by some pest insects in storage. For example, Sitophilus spp., Tribolium castaneum
40
41 315 (Herbst) (Coleloptera: Tenebrionidae) and Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae)

44 316 were shown to be resistant to malathion and methyl bromide[60,61]. In the same light, several
45
46 317 authors, attributed the resistance of pest to several parameters such as, the thickness of insect’s
47
48
318 exoskeleton, type of and concentration of insecticide, the ability of the insect to metabolize a
49
50
51 319 poisonous substance, the type of grains, and the insect location [62-64].
52
53 320 The sustainable management of pests does not aim at eradicating them but to maintain
54
55
56
321 their population under a noxious threshold [65]. Therefore, finding a pesticide that could meet

3
322 this requirement stands a great hope toward the development of an ecofriendly, targeted, efficient
4
5
6 323 and sustainable pesticide. The result obtained from the EO is a clear indication of the failure of
7
8 324 the insect to develop any remarkable tolerance across the generations. This may be due to the
9
10
11
325 multiple active sites and lipophilic properties of EO constituents that impaired the insect
12
13 326 physiology and thereby not enabling it to initiate any resistance [4,66,67]. Thus eventually led to
14
15
16 327 the disruption of the normal copulatory activities as reported by Oni and Ileke [68], and Adedire
17
18 328 et al. [69]. Most of the eggs laid couldn’t complete their life cycle thereby leading to a reduced
19
20 329 adult to form the subsequent generations and limiting the seed damage. EO available secondary
21
22
23 330 metabolites might have subtly altered detoxification and nutrition processes and regulated better
24
25 331 the frequency of emergence of new adults and maintained less harmful insect population.
26
27 332 One of the major challenges steps of cowpea production remains the storage of harvested
28
29
30 333 crops in such a way that it meets the nutritional requirements of consumers, livestock and
31
32 334 sustains good marketing values [65]. Therefore, appropriate protection measures may play an
33
34
35
335 important role toward solving this challenge. According to the FAO report on Handling and
36
37 336 Storage of Food Grains in Tropical and Subtropical Areas and reported by Hou et al. [70], the
38
39 337 protection against pests could only be efficient if it helps improving the local processing methods
40
41
42 338 to retain inherent natural nutritional value of produce.
43
44 339 The highest coefficients of the nutritional values recorded in EO treated cowpea seeds
45
46 340 compared with DDVP treated and standard is a clear indication of its capacity to boost the
47
48
49 341 nutritional compositions of the grains to better meet the demands in protein and other key
50
51 342 nutrients. The nutritional constituents (proteins, fats, carbohydrates) recorded in EO treatments
52
53
343 was higher than most of those previously reported in cowpea [55]. However, Gupta et al. [71]
54
55
56 344 observed higher content (27.7±0.22 g/100g) of protein from COVU-702 cowpea genotype than

345 that of our study. The Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER-R), the Chemical Score (CS), the Biological
4
5
6 346 Value (BV) and Essential Amino Acid Index (EAAI) were all higher than those recorded in
7
8 347 DDVP treatments. EAAI (96.33) and BV (89.99) of EO treated grains were higher than those
9
10
11
348 reported by Ilesanmi and Gungula [45] when they use neem (Azadirachta indica) and moringa
12
13 349 (Moringa oleifera) seed oils. From the predicted protein efficiency ratio, essential amino acids
14
15 350 index and biological value alongside with their protein fractions globulin, albumin, glutelin and
16
17
18 351 prolamin most of which values increased, it could be inferred that preserving cowpea with EO is
19
20 352 a safe and effective way to protect the grains against insect attack and optimize their protein
21
22 353 quality [72]. Amino acids remain a prerequisite for the synthesis of proteins and other important
23
24
25 354 nitrogen-containing compounds [46]. A diet containing an optimal amount of amino acids will
26
27 355 ensure a good physiological functioning of the body [10].
28
29
356 EO treated cowpea could be used to enhance and maintain a constant secretion of
30
31
32 357 haemoglobin and red blood cells [10]. Other minerals like Calcium, Manganese, Phosphorus,
33
34 358 Zinc, Magnesium, Potassium, Copper, Cobalt, Boron and Selenium may also help in fueling
35
36
37 359 enzymatic reactions, maintaining strong bones in addition to ensuring good functioning of
38
39 360 muscles [10].
40
41 361 The anti-nutritional compounds (tannins, phenols) varied in all the treatments but most
42
43
44 362 importantly, they were significantly higher in EO treated grains. The highest protection observed
45
46 363 in EO groups could be attributed to these anti-nutritional constituents whose astringent taste
47
48
364 affects the palatability of grains, disrupts the feeding behaviours [73], and reinforce their
49
50
51 365 resistance to insect infestations [74]. In the same light, the phenolics from seeds are also doubly
52
53 366 beneficial for the seeds itself as well as for the consumers because phenolic enriched diet helps to
54
55
56
367 prevent degenerative diseases and extend the lifespan in human [75-77].

368 5. Conclusion
4
5
6 369 Based on our results, the impact of the infestation has reduced the nutritional quality of the
7
8 370 commodity as huge difference between unaffected (standard) and affected (damaged) was
9
10
11
371 observed in all the measured parameters. The damaged seeds lost both nutritional quality and
12
13 372 virtual market acceptance. It is therefore a threat to food security, as the farmers will even lose
14
15 373 the interest to produce such crop. The use of DDVP, although effective at adult stage, induces
16
17
18 374 the development of resistance in C. maculatus and contributes to the destruction of most of the
19
20 375 key nutrients of the grains. This renders the seeds unsuitable for human consumption. In the
21
22 376 contrary, Lippia adoensis EO maintained appropriate and suitable proportions of most of the
23
24
25 377 essential amino acids to fulfill the human nutritional requirements. It can therefore be
26
27 378 incorporated in the storage system of cowpea in sub-Saharan Africa and Cameroon in particular.
28
29
379 Further investigations are needed for cost-effective evaluations of Lippia adoensis EO in stored
30
31
32 380 cowpea seeds.

REVIEW REPORT
Title: Essential oil optimizes the susceptibility of Callosobruchus maculatus and
enhances the nutritional qualities of stored cowpea Vigna unguiculata
Authors: Mazarin Akami1,2*, Hamada Chakira2, Awawing A. Andongma2, Kanjana

Reviewer comments to Authors
Reviewer 1:
Line 33: A transitional sentence is needed to pass from the methodology to the
results.
Answer (A): Thank you, done (See line 33 of the corrected manuscript).
Line 58: Is the flood in 2012 still affecting the production of cowpea in Far North
Cameroon?
A: Yes. This is as a result of loss of farm lands that has not been recovered till date. In
addition, huge crop damage caused by flood left farmers with little or no resources to
invest in farming (Sidi, 2012; Arieff, 2013).

Line 63: Callosobruchus maculatus belong to the family Chrysomelidae sub family
Bruchinae.
2
A: Thank you, corrected (See line 65).
Line 80: L. adoensis. Sentences from line 84 to 86 can be removed.
A: Thank you, done.
Line 91: the common name of cowpea is black eye beans.
A: Thank you, corrected (See line 90).
How cowpea from Cameroon found itself in China? and where the cowpea was
disinfected?
A: Cowpea manipulations were all handled in Cameroon. Thanks for pointing this out.
Why the leaf of Lippia was shade-dried and where was done the extraction of the
essential oil?
A: The leaves were shade-dried to avoid denaturing of the chemical constituents and
allow the extraction of higher quantity of oil. Please see the references below. The
extraction was carried out at Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.

Why the authors did not use synthetic chemical which is commonly found in
Cameroon?
A: Thank you for the question. Dichlorovos (DDVP) was used as standard because it is a
highly used pesticide in stored cowpea protection the north of Cameroon.

Line 131: the sentence is repeated twice, remove one.
A: Thank you, done (See line 130).
If adult mortality is recorded 6 days after infestation and insect of 2 days old were
used, then how long is the life span of the insect you used?
A: A variation of the adult life span of C. maculatus has been reported (Fox et al., 2004)
depending. Beck et al. (2004) for example reported an adult life span of 12 to 14 days.
However the present study suggests a life span of 9±3 days. This is supported by Akami
et al. (2016) who used similar populations of C. maculatus and the same rearing material
(cowpea).

Line 138: Here there is a problem, adult C. maculatus maximum life span is 9 days,
how then you left them inside the jars again 6 days after mortality count?
A: From literature, there is a Variation in the adult lifespan of C. maculatus which can
last up to 14 days (Fox et al., 2014). Therefore after 14 days we are sure all the insects are
dead. (2 days insects were treated for 6 days and surviving insects left for another 6 days
to lay eggs making a total of 14 days).

populations of the seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus." Heredity 92.3 (2004): 170
Line 139: which method do you used to count the eggs?
A: Counting under microscope.
Lines 141-145: are the emerged insects placed on treated seeds of not?
A: The newly emerged insects were placed on treated seeds except the control groups.
Why have you decided to use insects from treated seeds of the first experiment?
A: Because we wanted to evaluate the evolution of resistance and susceptibility of off-
springs from the same parental insects.
Discussion: no significant variations in the mortality were observed in EO
treatments except the number of eggs and the resulting adults that slightly
decreased. Why like that?
A: Many reasons may explain this situation:
1- The failure of EO treated insects to develop any resistance resulting to a likely
constant mortality over generations;
2- The slight decrease in eggs mortality we observed may be likely tied to the
closing down of egg’s spiracles which prevented water loss and initiate physical
resistance as reported in previous studies. (Woods et al. 2005; Cheng et al. 2012).

Reviewer 2:
General comments have been made on the manuscript.
Answer (A): Thank you for the valuable comments. All the suggestions have been taken
into consideration and modifications have been made to the main manuscript. Please refer
to lines 60, 61, 63-65, 67, 82, 83, 90, 108, 128, 129, 131, 140, 150, 162, 180, 181, 219,
242, 249,250, 263, 280, 290, 291, 302, 303 and 308-311on the final corrected manuscript.
If the authors insist that two populations (wild and laboratory cultures) were used
for the study they should provide the evidence.
A: The wild populations which had developed resistance to DDVP showed a decreasing
percentage mortality across generation (Fig.1 P=0.0176). However, the lab population
that had no resistance to DDVP showed no signs of resistance as the recorded mortality
rates are always high (Fig. S1 P= 0.0764). However, both populations showed no
significance resistance to EO across generations (P=0.057 and P=0.061, for lab and wild,
respectively, Fig. 1 (manuscript main text) and Fig. S1 (Electronic Supplementary
Materials ESM 1).

Title: Essential oil optimizes the susceptibility of Callosobruchus maculatus and
enhances the nutritional qualities of stored cowpea Vigna unguiculata
Abstract:
Change the statement ‘’In an attempt to circumvent these constraints, we
investigated the susceptibility of C. maculatus to 2,3-Dichlorovinyl dimethyl
phosphate (DDVP) and Lippia adoensis essential oil (EO) and then assessed the
variations in the proportions of nutritional values of treated grains 150 days after
storage.’’

Answer (A): Thank you, done (see lines 28-32).
Introduction
Line 61-62: The author did not mention any postharvest loss or its cause /prior to
this line before jumping to limiting the losses.
A: Thank you. The extent of postharvest losses has been inserted into the manuscript (see
line 58-59).
Line 74:‘…..cowpea infestation….’ It is insect pest that infest cowpea and not vice
versa.
A: The statement was corrected by using the reported speech (see line 74).

Materials and methods
Line 91: The author need to state the quantity of the un-infested cowpea seeds that
was collected.
A: Thank you, done (see line 90).
Line 101: The author should state the duration for the emergence of the progeny.
A: Thank you, done (see line 101).
Lines 114-115: The author should check the correct chemical name for DDVP. It
should be 2, 2-Dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate instead of 2, 3-Dichlorovinyl
dimethyl phosphate as stated. Please check and correct.
A: Done. 2, 2-Dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate is the right chemical name (see line 113
and/or chemical structure below). Thank you.
Chemical structure of Dichlorvos (2, 2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate or DDVP).

A: Thank you, done (see line 258).
Line 317: Effect of temperature or weather on the resistance or susceptibility of the
insect to DDVP.
A: Sorry, we did not understand what the reviewer means here.
Lines 320-321: Is the statement below based on your findings or other study
conducted by other authors? ‘The sustainable management of pests does not aim at
eradicating them but to maintain their population under a noxious threshold (65).’
A: This statement is reported by Bale et al., 2008. However the goal of carrying out the
present study is to identify pesticides which support this view. Our results support this
view.
