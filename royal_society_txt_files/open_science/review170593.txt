Review for RSOS-170593
An Investigation into the Unusual Linkage Isomerisation and Nitrite Reduction Activity of a
Novel Tris(2-pyridyl) Copper Complex
The manuscript by Symes and co-workers reports the synthesis of a new ligand and its use in the
formation of two new copper(II) complexes including a di-nitrite compound. The compounds
have been well characterised using NMR, MS, IR, UV, EPR and DFT calculations and the
structure of the di-nitrite complex determined using single crystal X-ray diffraction. Interestingly,
the di-nitrite compound displays all three of the most common binding modes for nitrite (<U+03BA>2 -
ONO, <U+03BA>1 -ONO and <U+03BA>1 -NO2), as confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction and further
supported by infrared spectroscopy (and DFT calculations). The solution-phase behaviour of
[Cu(1)2](PF6)2 and [Cu1(NO2)2] was examined using EPR and UV-vis spectroscopy and these
experiments suggest that the copper centre in [Cu1(NO2)2] was bound to two nitrites.
Electrochemical studies were also carried out. Disappointingly for the authors the complex was
not a competent nitrite reduction electrocatalyst in acetonitrile, even in the presence of additional
proton donors. However, these observation will no doubt guide the future design of active
catalysis. This is a very solid and well performed study and is worthy of publication.

In this paper, the synthesis and characterization of a copper complex with the coligand 6-methyl-
tris(2-pyridyl)CHOMe (ligand 1) and the corresponding nitrite adduct, [Cu(1)(NO2)2], are
presented. These complexes are characterized by different spectroscopic methods, and the nitrite
adduct was also structurally characterized. Interestingly, the crystal structure is disordered and
shows a combination of a O,O-bidentate nitrito ligand with a monodentate O-nitrito and an N-
bound nitro ligand. The properties of the complex, including its electrocatalytic properties and its
ability to electrocatalytically reduce nitrite to NO, are further investigated. This paper makes a
nice contribution to the vibrant field of copper nitrite reductase models, and should be suitable
for publication after some revision, as detailed in the following:
(a) The ligand system presented here is very similar to the one previously published by
Jonas and Stack (ref. 42). A statement should be added to the Introduction that clearly points out
how the current study goes beyond what has been done before. Comparisons in this regard are
made throughout the paper, but a clear statement should also be added to the Introduction (page
4, following line 35).
(b) Page 3, line 35-38: the authors missed an important paper here by Fujisawa and
coworkers: Inorg. Chem. 2007, 46, 3916-3933. The complex [Cu(L1’)(ONO)(NO2)] also contains
two nitrite ligands in different binding modes. Also, it is documented in this paper that the
energies between the different nitrite binding modes are really small.
(c) Page 3, Line 49/50: another related compound that mediates nitrite reduction to NO
contains a tripodal hydrotris(triazolyl)borate type ligand: Inorg. Chem. 2012, 51, 7004-7006. This
study needs to be references here.
(d) Page 13, line 38: I am sorry, but a Cu-L bond distance > 2.6 A does not correspond to a
coordinative bond, but a weak (electrostatic) interaction. The text needs to be changed
accordingly.
(e) Page 18, line 12-16: the two N-O stretches in one nitrite molecule are strongly coupled,
and show a quite large splitting between the corresponding symmetric and antisymmetric
stretch. Based on the data and detailed analysis in Inorg. Chem. 2007, 46, 3916-3933, the signals at
1373 and 1327 cm-1 cannot really originate from the same nitrite ligand. The authors also mention
that they performed frequency calculations, but the calculated N-O frequencies are not
mentioned in the text. A direct comparison between experiment and calculations should also be
included on page 18, line 19 and following. The vibrational analysis part clearly needs
improvement.
(f) Page 19: did the authors collect low-temperature EPR data for the nitrite complex? Those
data should be included.

We thank the referees for their careful reading of our manuscript and for the very useful
suggestions that they have made. In the following, we respond to all the referees’ comments
(shown in italics) in turn (our answers are in bold type). Appended at the end is also a response
to the non-scientific changes requested by the editorial office. Where we have made changes
to the manuscript or SI in response to these comments, we have highlighted these in yellow.
The new infrared and EPR data has been added to the rest of the data on Enlighten (the
University of Glasgow’s open access online data repository), at
http://dx.doi.org/10.5525/gla.researchdata.416.
We believe that the changes made to the manuscript have improved it significantly, and we
thank the referees for their help in this.

(Very) Minor Revisions
The EA of the ligands is not quite right?
The elemental analyses of Ligand 1 and [Cu(1)2](PF6)2 are both within the normal limits
for C, H and N. The elemental analysis of [Cu1(NO2)2] is also within the normal limits
for C and H; however, the value for N is slightly lower than calculated (although not by
much). The most likely explanation for this is that a small (1-2%) amount of the
[Cu(1)2](PF6)2 precursor exists in this material. However, this should not affect the data
or conclusions regarding either the structure of [Cu1(NO2)2] or its electrochemistry.
No IR data is listed for the ligand or the [Cu(1)2](PF6)2 complex for completeness these
could be added
We have now added these data to the Experimental section, and also provide the spectra
on Enlighten. Collecting these data was an especially good idea, as it has provided new
insight which we discuss below (see our answer to Referee 2’s comment “e”).
Also presumably the IR spectrum of the [Cu1(NO2)2] displayed some C-H stretches at
around 3000 cm-1 ?
It does indeed; the data we previously reported in the experimental section were
selected bands. We have now added the C-H stretches (3117 cm-1, br) to the
experimental. The full IR spectrum of this compound is available through Enlighten.

out how the current study goes beyond what has been done before. Comparisons in this
regard are made throughout the paper, but a clear statement should also be added to the
Introduction (page 4, following line 35).
We now add such a statement to the introduction, immediately after we introduce our
complex which is analogous to Stack’s.
(b) Page 3, line 35-38: the authors missed an important paper here by Fujisawa and
coworkers: Inorg. Chem. 2007, 46, 3916-3933. The complex [Cu(L1’)(ONO)(NO2)] also
contains two nitrite ligands in different binding modes. Also, it is documented in this paper
that the energies between the different nitrite binding modes are really small.
We thank the referee for this useful citation. We now include this along with a short
description of the findings on page 3, immediately after our discussion of the Woollard-
Shore system as new reference 25. We also make reference to this work later on in
regards to our DFT calculations (immediately before Figure 7) and regarding our
vibrational spectra (see comment “e” below).
(c) Page 3, Line 49/50: another related compound that mediates nitrite reduction to
NO contains a tripodal hydrotris(triazolyl)borate type ligand: Inorg. Chem. 2012, 51, 7004-
7006. This study needs to be references here.
We thank the referee for calling our attention to this work. We now reference this
(where we discuss other examples of functional analogues of CuNIR) as new reference
24.
(d) Page 13, line 38: I am sorry, but a Cu-L bond distance > 2.6 A does not correspond
to a coordinative bond, but a weak (electrostatic) interaction. The text needs to be changed
accordingly.
This is indeed a rather long bond. We have toned down the discussion here. Indeed, the
coordination is reminiscent of the “asymmetric O,O coordination mode” observed by
Lehnert and co-workers (Inorg. Chem. 2007, 46, 3916-3933), which we cite in our
revised text here.
(e) Page 18, line 12-16: the two N-O stretches in one nitrite molecule are strongly
coupled, and show a quite large splitting between the corresponding symmetric and
antisymmetric stretch. Based on the data and detailed analysis in Inorg. Chem. 2007, 46,
3916-3933, the signals at 1373 and 1327 cm-1 cannot really originate from the same nitrite
ligand. The authors also mention that they performed frequency calculations, but the
calculated N-O frequencies are not mentioned in the text. A direct comparison between
experiment and calculations should also be included on page 18, line 19 and following. The
vibrational analysis part clearly needs improvement.
After collecting the IR spectra of the ligand and [Cu(1)2](PF6)2 (see answer to Referee
1), we have now completely re-worked this section. This is because these spectra show
that there is considerable overlap between bands predicted by our calculations and
bands present in the ligand and/or [Cu(1)2](PF6)2; we cannot, therefore, be sure if these
bands are due to nitrite, the complexes, or a combination of both. What we can see,
however, is that 3 of the bands (1373, 1327 and 1131 cm-1) are not present in either the
ligand or [Cu(1)2](PF6)2 and are therefore due to bound nitrite.
We have amended the discussion accordingly, and have also discussed the two possible
assignment patterns possible. One assignment is based on our calculations and the
references we previously cited, the other is based on the paper suggested by the referee.
These two assignments differ in certain aspects, but agree in the important conclusion
that nitrite is present in [Cu1(NO2)2] in both O-bound and N-bound forms. We thank
both referees for their most useful suggestions connected with the IR.
(f) Page 19: did the authors collect low-temperature EPR data for the nitrite complex?
Those data should be included.
We have now collected this spectrum, which we show in the Supporting information
(Figure S5) and call out in the main text.
