The goal of this manuscript was to assess whether diet quantity and quality have similar effects
on body size and trait allometry. Additionally, the authors sought to elucidate whether any of
these dietary effects are sex-specific. In general, this manuscript is very well written, and the
results potentially add exciting insights into the role of diet on body shape and size. However, I
do have a few minor concerns, and one potentially more major one. First, although the
manuscript is well-written, I found the introduction to be somewhat lacking in addressing the
sex-specific aspect of this study. Sexual differences in their response to diet quantity and quality
seem to be a key aspect of this study, yet these potential differences are only briefly mentioned.
While the importance of examining quantity vs. quality is well introduced, I would have liked a
bit more on the importance of examining sexual differences as well. Another concern is in the
presentation of the results. The majority of the key results are relegated to the supplementary
information. I would have liked some of these results moved to the manuscript, particularly
Table S10. Additionally, I wonder if there is a more illustrative way to present the information
from Tables S6-S9, as these tables include some of the key results of the manuscript (i.e., that
quantity and quality have different allometric effects and that the sexes differ in their allometric
responses). Finally, a potentially more significant concern I have with the current manuscript is
the issue of very uneven sample sizes between the various diets both within and between the
sexes. Some of the diet treatments only had an N of 1 or 2, while others were closer to 30. I’m
assuming this variation is due to issues with survivability under certain diets, but I wonder what
effect these uneven sample sizes have on potentially biasing the statistical models. More
3
worrisome is the fact that males and females have a different number of total diets fed to them.
Again, this seems to be due to some variation in survivability across sexes, but given the main
conclusion that there are sex-specific effects of diet, I do not feel as if the authors adequately
addressed any effect these sample size differences may have on the main conclusions of this
manuscript. I do not have a keen sense of exactly what effect this may have on the main
conclusions, but it seems to me that the trait value in a treatment with an N of 1 isn’t likely to be
an accurate representation of the effect of that diet on a trait. Additionally, for food concentration
or P:C allometries with smaller sample sizes, wouldn’t an outlier effect be much greater? As such,
are the differences in allometries reported here representative of actual variation in allometry or
the result of uneven sample sizes. Again, it is possible that the sample size issue doesn’t
fundamentally affect the conclusions made within this manuscript, but I think some discussion of
this is warranted.
Other comments:
L102-108: These sentences do not belong in the introduction, and seem to be similar to the end of
the abstract.
L133-135: So each diet had 180 eggs in total, correct? Does this mean that the mortality of the flies
in all diets was significantly less than 50% or do some proportion of eggs never hatch? I do not
work with Drosophila, but this discrepancy between your initial and experimental sample sizes
seems incredibly high. If a substantial number of flies die in whichever diet you’re feeding them,
how informative are these results in a nutritional context?
L140-152: When explaining how measurements were taken, refer the reader to the diagrams in
Figure 2.
L166: For all of the models in this paper, is there an a priori reason for including the quadratic
terms in the models? If so, I think an explanation for why these terms are included would be
appropriate. Why would one expect nonlinear effects of concentration or P:C? Additionally, I
suggest changing the term for P:C ratio (R) to something else as it and its quadratic are too similar
to marginal R2.
L235-238: Is this correct? Table S2 indicates that the response of the genital was different to the
response to leg, thorax, and wing, while thorax was different only to palp.
L254-258: The patterns explained here are not readily apparent in Figure S1. All of these patterns
are explained in general terms (i.e., average differences), but figure S1 breaks all of the allometries
down by diet. As such, it’s difficult to decipher these patterns from this figure. Further, what do
the large negative allometries at low food quantities and qualities indicate? Doesn’t this indicate
that these traits exhibit strong negative allometry? If so, the male genital seems to have a strong
negative P:C allometric response at low food. I’m curious why the authors decided not to discuss
this, as the genital is generally non-responsive to changes in food.
L264: Shouldn’t this read “…the allometric relationship between wing and thorax size…”?
L268: The P values here do not match those on Figure 1b
L272: Figure 1a instead of 1b?
Figure 1a: What do the different marker colors indicate? This information is not indicated in the
figure caption.
Figure 1b: The figure caption indicates the same P values as the main text, but the ones on the
figure do not match

This manuscript was reviewed by two experts. Both of whom recognized the importance of the
work. The ms is certainly a useful and relevant contribution for RSOS. Both reviewers were quite
confused by the statistical analyses performed, and were concerned about low sample sizes.
While the more critical reviewer also raises very relevant points about the focus of the
introduction. Overall, I thought the reviewer were fair and constructive. With gratitude to both
reviewers, I invite the authors to revise the ms comprehensively utilizing these comments.

Appendix A
This is a very interesting, in-­-depth paper describing the effects of diet quality 
(specifically dietary protein and carbohydrate) on the size of different body traits, and 
the scaling relationships between these traits in Drosophila melanogaster. The primary 
motivation for these studies was that prior research in the area of diet on trait size and 
scaling focused mostly on the effects of diet quantity, rather than on the balance of 
specific macronutrients in the diet. From these past studies it also remains unclear 
whether the effects on body size that were described are mirrored in the size of 
individual traits, such as thorax length or wing area. 
This study advances the previous literature by testing the effects of diet quality and 
quantity together on the size of individual traits such as wing area or genital size. The 
authors found that scaling relationships between individual traits, and the size of 
individual traits, change in different ways in response to diet quality versus diet 
quantity. Furthermore, the authors report significant male-­-female differences in the 
overall responsiveness to diet changes, but also in responses to specific macronutrients 
(e.g. male trait size is unaffected by carbohydrate level). 
This study represents a significant advance in this area, and I believe this data is 
important to share with the Drosophila community. Studies on the effects of dietary 
interventions on lifespan and other life history traits are a rapidly growing area of 
research; yet, few studies have systematically examined the responses of both sexes in 
detail. That there are sex differences in responses to dietary changes will be important 
in interpreting data from males where the magnitude of lifespan extension in response 
to dietary restriction is typically smaller than in females. 
This is a very detailed, well-­-designed study, and my comment relates only to sample size 
for one or two of the experimental diets. I would also like to add that I do not have 
sufficient expertise to evaluate the statistical methods described in this paper. 
1) In Supplemental Table S1, there are several instances of a sample size (N) of 1
individual for a given diet (e.g. P:C à<U+F0E0> ratio 1:14.6, Diet à<U+F0E0> 360 g/L). I appreciate that 
there are several diets where it is extremely difficult to get viable flies; however, I 
suggest that measurements from 3 individuals ought to be the minimum to draw any 
conclusions. If this is absolutely impossible, please state the lethality of this diet. For 
example, “out of 1500 animals raised on the diet, only 1 survived to adulthood for 
analysis”.

w), we used regression analysis to explore the relationship between trait size and food-concentration and ratio,
between trait size and carbohydrate and protein concentration. This models the relationship across the whole
e of dietary conditions, mitigating the problem of small samples sizes for any one particular diet. Nevertheless,
epeated our analysis using only data from diets where we had more than five flies of either sex. All of our initial
lusions were supported in this second analysis, apart from the finding that for the female femur the food2 term is
nger significant. This indicates that the data at the edges of the nutritional surface (where food concentration and
ration was low) do not bias the analysis. Because of ethical issues of removing data from regression analyses,
ever, we did not include this second analysis in our text. Nevertheless, we have noted this issue in the main text
01. We also note that we confirmed that for all our analyses the QQ plot reveals normal residuals, again
esting that our analysis is not biased by outliers.
our allometric analysis, a small number of flies per vial is more problematic, since the allometries are fitted to
n trait size for each vial. The smaller the number of flies this mean is based upon, the greater the potential of
ducing bias into the analysis. We thus repeated our allometric analysis only using flies from vials that generated
f each sex. All of our initial conclusions were supported, with the one exception that we no longer found
ficant variation among food-concentration allometries at different P:C ratios in males. We have detailed this
nd restrictive analysis in the results section at L310-324.

hank the reviewer for their thorough reading of our paper and for their helpful suggestions for its improvement.
address the concerns of the reviewer below.
The goal of this manuscript was to assess whether diet quantity and quality have similar effects on body size
and trait allometry. Additionally, the authors sought to elucidate whether any of these dietary effects are sex-
specific. In general, this manuscript is very well written, and the results potentially add exciting insights into
the role of diet on body shape and size. However, I do have a few minor concerns, and one potentially more
major one. First, although the manuscript is well-written, I found the introduction to be somewhat lacking in
addressing the sex-specific aspect of this study. Sexual differences in their response to diet quantity and
quality seem to be a key aspect of this study, yet these potential differences are only briefly mentioned.
While the importance of examining quantity vs. quality is well introduced, I would have liked a bit more on
the importance of examining sexual differences as well.
agree that we did not sufficiently deal with the importance of examining sex-differences in the introduction. We
now added a paragraph reviewing what is known of sex-differences in phenotypic plasticity, and how this
cts our understanding of how trait size responds to changes in diet quality and quantity (L87-103).
Another concern is in the presentation of the results. The majority of the key results are relegated to the
supplementary information. I would have liked some of these results moved to the manuscript, particularly
Table S10. Additionally, I wonder if there is a more illustrative way to present the information from Tables
S6-S9, as these tables include some of the key results of the manuscript (i.e., that quantity and quality have
different allometric effects and that the sexes differ in their allometric responses).
agree that it would be helpful if more of the supplemental tables are included in the main text. We have now
ed Supplementary Tables 5 and 10 into the main text. We have also modified Supplementary Table 5 (now Table
that it highlights key comparisons between allometries, using cell color. We have modified the text accordingly.
Finally, a potentially more significant concern I have with the current manuscript is the issue of very uneven
sample sizes between the various diets both within and between the sexes. Some of the diet treatments only
had an N of 1 or 2, while others were closer to 30. I’m assuming this variation is due to issues with
survivability under certain diets, but I wonder what effect these uneven sample sizes have on potentially
biasing the statistical models. More worrisome is the fact that males and females have a different number of
total diets fed to them. Again, this seems to be due to some variation in survivability across sexes, but given
the main conclusion that there are sex-specific effects of diet, I do not feel as if the authors adequately
addressed any effect these sample size differences may have on the main conclusions of this manuscript. I
do not have a keen sense of exactly what effect this may have on the main conclusions, but it seems to me
that the trait value in a treatment with an N of 1 isn’t likely to be an accurate representation of the effect of
that diet on a trait. Additionally, for food concentration or P:C allometries with smaller sample sizes, wouldn’t
an outlier effect be much greater? As such, are the differences in allometries reported here representative of
actual variation in allometry or the result of uneven sample sizes. Again, it is possible that the sample size
issue doesn’t fundamentally affect the conclusions made within this manuscript, but I think some discussion
of this is warranted.
agree that the uneven samples sizes may potentially impact our statistical analysis. As the reviewer observes, the
en samples are a result of higher mortality on more extreme diets, particularly in males. For the univariate
yses, we deal with this issue by using regression analysis, rather than an ANOVA: that is, we treat diet as a
nuous rather than a categorical variable. While there will be fewer data points at the edges of the nutritional
scape (Figure 3), the trends are based on the data points across the full range of dietary conditions. A separate
elated issue is whether the data collected from the more extreme diets unduly influence the observed trends.
ugh we have no a priori reason to expect that flies reared on these diets should have undue influence, we have
nalyzed the data excluding data from diets that generated fewer than 5 flies of the same sex. The outcome of all
nivariate analyses are unchanged, except for the female femur, the food2 effect is no longer significant (Table 1),
for the female wing and palp, the P*C interaction become (just) significant (Table 6). However, because of the
al issue of removing outliers from regression analyses, particularly when this removal renders previously non-
ficant effects significant, we retain our original analysis. Nevertheless, we have noted this issue in the main text
01. We also note that we confirmed that all our analyses the QQ plot reveals normal residuals, again suggesting
our analysis is not biased by outliers.
he allometric analysis, we fitted the allometric relationship using mean trait size for each vial. Consequently,
ns that are based on only a small number of flies per vial may bias the allometric relationships. We therefore re-
yzed the data using only measurements from vials where there were more than 5 individuals of the same sex, as
thod for mitigating this bias. None of the data from the very lowest P:C diets passed this threshold.
ertheless, the results of this analysis on the remaining data were the same as for the full data set, with the one
ption that we no longer found significant variation among food-concentration allometries at different P:C ratios in
s. The results of this analysis are described at L310-324in the main text, and in supplementary tables S6-S10

L133-135: So each diet had 180 eggs in total, correct? Does this mean that the mortality of the flies in all
diets was significantly less than 50% or do some proportion of eggs never hatch? I do not work with
Drosophila, but this discrepancy between your initial and experimental sample sizes seems incredibly high.
If a substantial number of flies die in whichever diet you’re feeding them, how informative are these results in
a nutritional context?
e reviewer observes, there was a discrepancy between the number of eggs places in the vials and the number
es that eclosed. There are several reasons for this. First, Drosophila females often lay unfertilized eggs, so some
e eggs never hatched. Second, there is mortality of larvae. For an isogenic line of flies reared on standard food,
ypically see ~30 adults from 50 eggs. Our experiment used a genetically heterogeneous population, but we saw
ilar rate of hatching the ‘best’ diet (113/180 for 90g/l at P:C of 1.3:1, supplementary table S1). On more
eme’ diets, the discrepancy is therefore likely due to a higher level of mortality. We cannot measure the
hology of flies that do not hatch, and no nutritional condition allows 100% survival. Nevertheless, even if a diet
uces a small number of flies, the morphology of flies that can survive such a nutritional condition is informative of
flies respond to their nutritional environment. From a more philosophical perspective, animals that are able to
nt a plastic response to environmental change survive, while those that are not will die. As researchers interested
e developmental mechanisms and evolution of phenotypic plasticity, we are primarily concerned with the former.
sequently, even if a particular diet has low survivability, measuring the phenotypic response of individuals that are
to survive the diet is informative.
L140-152: When explaining how measurements were taken, refer the reader to the diagrams in Figure 2.
have now included this helpful suggestion.
L166: For all of the models in this paper, is there an a priori reason for including the quadratic terms in the
models? If so, I think an explanation for why these terms are included would be appropriate. Why would one
expect nonlinear effects of concentration or P:C? Additionally, I suggest changing the term for P:C ratio (R)
to something else as it and its quadratic are too similar to marginal R2.
nd-order polynomial regression is the standard approach to modeling non-linear response surfaces, as
ribed by Lande and Arnold (1983). We now include reference to this paper, and other’s that have used a similar
oach, in the method section. We agree that the use of R to indicate ratio is confusing, and have changed this
meter to K.
L235-238: Is this correct? Table S2 indicates that the response of the genital was different to the response
to leg, thorax, and wing, while thorax was different only to palp.
have corrected this error.
L254-258: The patterns explained here are not readily apparent in Figure S1. All of these patterns are
explained in general terms (i.e., average differences), but figure S1 breaks all of the allometries down by
diet. As such, it’s difficult to decipher these patterns from this figure. Further, what do the large negative
allometries at low food quantities and qualities indicate? Doesn’t this indicate that these traits exhibit strong
negative allometry? If so, the male genital seems to have a strong negative P:C allometric response at low
food. I’m curious why the authors decided not to discuss this, as the genital is generally non-responsive to
changes in food.
have now modified our text to better reflect the observation that there is variation among food-concentration
etries at different P:C ratios (L269-273). We now explicitly refer to the negative allometry of the male genitalia at
P:C ratio and food-concentration (L313-324), and explore whether this is because of sampling error. As
ussed above, we repeated our allometric analysis using mean trait size from vials with >5 individuals of the same
The 1:14.6 food-concentration allometries do not pass this threshold. However, the 45g P:C allometries do, and
enitalia still have a negative allometry. While this is intriguing, we do not discuss this further, since the focus of
aper is on the effect of diet quality and quantity on trait size and body proportion in general rather than the
ive plasticity of any one particular trait.
