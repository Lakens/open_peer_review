Comments for the Authors:
This study is superbly designed. Indeed, many of the shortcoming of the original study are
corrected, while still enabling the authors to conduct a meaningful replication of the original
piece of research. With the exception of one possibility, the statistical analyses were all
meaningful to me. This is an ambitious design, and I recommend going forward with the study.
The Time 1 assessment protocol is impressive. Very systematic and thoroughly thought out; I
especially liked the Swedish Music Discrimination Task and the Raven assessments. Yet, all of
the proposed assessments seems highly appropriate to me. The only other thing I might think of
is the Wonderlic (Gottfredson, 1997), given the familiarity of this measure to occupational
psychology broadly defined. I know that Raven is translatable into IQ units (Jensen et al, 1988),
and I very much like that you are using the Raven; but, if possible, the Wonderlic would be
highly complementary.
The one statistical analysis that gave me pause was the discriminant function analysis noted on
page 37. I have used this application in my own research on multiple occasions, and I have found
it to be most informative (as it would be in the current context). But is sample size an issue here
given the number of assessments relevant to this analysis? Like factor analysis and multiple
regression, the rule of thumb is around 10 to 20 subjects per variable (15 is typically seen as fine).
If sample size could be increased to handle this appropriately, I totally agree discriminant
function analyses would be a nice feature of this study and would complement the excellent
design that the authors have crafted.
Overall, the authors are to be congratulated for detailing and very well-designed study that is
important.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Professor Chris Chambers):
Two expert reviewers have now appraised the manuscript. The reviews are positive, with both
reviewers judging the Stage 1 Primary Criteria to be met, and both recommending Stage 1 in
principle acceptance. Reviewer 2, however, raises two questions about the materials and
statistical analyses. If it is not possible to alter these then the response to reviewers (and where
appropriate, the manuscript itself) should fully justify these elements of the design. A minor
revision is recommended to address these points.

Thanks for this paper, it is an important contribution to the literature. I only have a few more
suggestions to strengthen the manuscript.
1. You motivate your article in the introduction by explaining how this particular paper has had a
large impact both within the academic community and also outside it among the public. Perhaps
this could be mentioned as an additional motivating factor for this attempted replication in the
beginning of your discussion section given I think this is a key reason why you are attempting to
see if the paper stands even with your additional improved method and analysis additions.
2. Though I think you are reasonably fair to Ericsson in regards to his definitional shifts or creeps,
at the same time I'd encourage you to reread especially the abstract, intro, and discussion in
particular to ensure it is as neutral as possible.
3. You note that the size of the core finding was much smaller. Is this smaller finding still of
importance? Is there a way to communicate that clearly to the reader in the abstract and in the
discussion/conclusion?
4. It seems that you are basically stating that you tried to replicate this really influential expertise
paper and can't really replicate it and in fact the conclusions of the original study are not
supported as stated by the original authors. It seems most plausible that the lack of replication is
due to the your additional improvements in the methods. Though this is not a direct replication
given you've made some improvements. Could perhaps discuss a bit about what this type of
replication is? (is it a constructive replication, following Lykken's formulation?)
Thanks for conducting this important research and I hope these suggestions are helpful.

Comments for the Authors:
I have read this study twice now and believe that it is an excellent contribution to the literature.
The authors have provided a compelling conceptual and statistical rational for their approach
and, in many ways, the way in which they have operationalized each analytic move is exemplary.
I was particularly impressed by the way in which they linked each analysis to embedded text
(and quotes) that they pulled from the literature.
In addition to executing a superb replication, the authors have added important (additional)
controls of their own to advance this area. This is very careful, impressive, and important work.
A few things to think about in crafting a revision:
Abstract
Rather than “operational definition” how about the way in which Ericsson et al. (1993)
operationalize deliberate practice (practice alone), and their theoretical but previously
unmeasured definition of deliberate practice (teacher-designed practice), …” This way, your
description won’t be tied to earlier ideas about operational definitions (viz., a concept IS what its
measure IS).
Page 3 (first paragraph). I couldn’t help thinking of Epstein’s (2011) excellent book, The sports
gene.
Because in addition to height and body size, he has several other physical and physiological
parameters of human individuality that clearly come into play.
Page 3 (second paragraph). Was it Gladwell’s 10,000-hour rule? I thought this was suggested by
someone else earlier.
Pages 13-14 constitute an excellent discussion of “sample size,” very compelling.

study is superbly designed. Indeed, many of the shortcoming of the original study are
ected, while still enabling the authors to conduct a meaningful replication of the original
e of research. With the exception of one possibility, the statistical analyses were all
aningful to me. This is an ambitious design, and I recommend going forward with the study.
Reply: Thank you for these comments.
Time 1 assessment protocol is impressive. Very systematic and thoroughly thought out; I
ecially liked the Swedish Music Discrimination Task and the Raven assessments. Yet, all of
proposed assessments seems highly appropriate to me. The only other thing I might think
the Wonderlic (Gottfredson, 1997), given the familiarity of this measure to occupational
chology broadly defined. I know that Raven is translatable into IQ units (Jensen et al, 1988),
I very much like that you are using the Raven; but, if possible, the Wonderlic would be
ly complementary.
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. Ideally, with enough resources, other tests could be
uded. There are a number of reasons why we don’t think the Wonderlic is ideal. First, while
a popular measure, evidence of its validity is limited. Notably, the Wonderlic does not
dict academic performance (Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2008; Furnham, Chamorro-
muzic, & McDougall, 2002; McKelvie, 1994) and is inconsistent as a predictor of job
ormance (Barrick, Mount, & Strauss, 1993; Frei & McDaniel, 1998; Hogan & Hogan, 1995;
ns, Hoffman, & Michel, 2009; Rode, Arthaud-Day, Mooney, Near, & Baldwin, 2008).
ther, recent work by Hicks, Harrison and Engle (2015) found that, when controlling for
king memory capacity, the Wonderlic has no direct association with fluid intelligence. Hicks
l. (2015) also found that the Wonderlic varies in whether it predicts working memory
acity or not depending on participants’ fluid intelligence. We have more succinctly added this
onale to the manuscript. The Fluid Intelligence measure sub-section now reads:
Fluid intelligence. We included two measures of fluid intelligence: Raven’s Advanced
Progressive Matrices [S5] and Letter Sets [S6]. The mean proportion correct on the two
measures serves as the composite fluid intelligence score. A number of other intelligence
measures could have been included, such as the Wonderlic test [S7]. We did not include the
Wonderlic because evidence for its validity is limited both in terms of being a consistent
predictor of job performance and in terms of correlations with fluid intelligence (see, e.g.,
[S8]).
one statistical analysis that gave me pause was the discriminant function analysis noted on
e 37. I have used this application in my own research on multiple occasions, and I have
nd it to be most informative (as it would be in the current context). But is sample size an
e here given the number of assessments relevant to this analysis? Like factor analysis and
tiple regression, the rule of thumb is around 10 to 20 subjects per variable (15 is typically
n as fine). If sample size could be increased to handle this appropriately, I totally agree
riminant function analyses would be a nice feature of this study and would complement the
ellent design that the authors have crafted.
Reply: We have removed discriminant function analysis from the analysis plan.
rall, the authors are to be congratulated for detailing and very well-designed study that is
ortant.
