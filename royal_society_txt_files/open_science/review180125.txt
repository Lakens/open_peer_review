This manuscript studied the sticking effect of a monopolar electrosurgical cutting blade. The
authors compared the sticking strength between a control study (heating only) and an
electrosurgical cutting test. Morphology and composition on the electrode surface were also
studied.
The study design has some flaw or lack of details in the text. In order to identify the effect of
electric field, the authors used a “heat-adherence test” as the control by heating the electrode to
260 degree C. However, the total energy consumption (i.e. thermal energy) was not controlled
between the electrosurgical cutting test and the heat-adherence test. It is very likely that more
energy was introduced to the tissue during the electrosurgical cutting test. The tissue has
considerable higher heat capacity than stainless steel, the electrode material. In the heat-
adherence test, the heat from the heated electrode would quickly dissipate to the tissue. It’s
unclear that the control and experimental groups had similar temperature profiles. Did the
author maintain the electrode temperature at 260 for 10 mins? Or just did the author just heat the
electrode to 260 and then insert to the tissue? Why 10 mins? From the reviewer’s point of view,
it’s very likely that the electrosurgical cutting test had more thermal energy input and thus
contribute to the stronger sticking. In this case, we cannot have a direct comparison between the
control and experimental groups and thus it’s unclear if the difference is caused purely by the
effect of electric field. The information about temperature or thermal energy is critical to the
comparison and is missing in this study.
The authors could also explain why use “grinding slurry of porcine liver” in the heat-adherence
test instead of just inserting the heated electrode to the liver tissue. This may also cause some
difference in sticking.
Other comments:
-The experiential setup could be explained in more detailed and some pictures of the setup would
help the reader to understand how the experiment is conducted. Ex: how long is the cutting
path? The testing sample for binding strength is also not very clear.
-The histological analysis didn’t add much information to the study.
-The written language could be improved.

label_comment_2
The authors have presented original research investigation and drawn attention to the role of
high-frequency electric field in the tissue sticking problem of minimally invasive electrosurgical
devices. However there are serious concerns about the study design and the control test that
would cast doubt on the interpretation and conclusion of the study.
1. Tissue sample preparation is different for the electrosurgical cutting test vs. the heat-adherence
control test: porcine liver chunks with a size of about 80×50×20 mm for the cutting test vs.
grinding liver slurry for the control test. Why wasn’t the same sample preparation used for both
tests? The different sample preparation introduced different starting tissue morphology that
would cast doubt on the origin of the resulting loose and porous microstructure on the electrode
after the control heat-adherence test and compromise the interpretation. If the purpose is to
reveal the effect of high-frequency electric field on tissue sticking, one should try to maintain the
same conditions including sample preparation.
2. Based on the information given (The cutting depth of 10 mm was finished under the cutting
power of 50 W and the cutting speed of 8 mm/s), the cutting test for each cut lasted about 1.25 s.
The control test by submerging the hot electrodes in the grinding slurry lasted about 10 min to
form sticking tissue upon active electrode. Later surface analysis showed that the surface
morphologies of the layer of sticking tissue were different. So besides the different starting tissue
morphology for the cutting and control test, the duration of action is also different. With the
sensitive surface characterization technique, would it be possible to examine the surface
morphology of electrode for the control test at the comparable time scale of action (seconds rather
than minutes)?
3. The authors ensured the active electrode for the cutting and control tests having the same
temperature (260 <U+2103>). However, tissue temperatures near the active electrodes were not measured
which would be different for the two tests due to different heating mechanisms and would affect
tissue sticking. To be rigorous, not only the temperature of the active electrode but also the tissue
temperature profile around the electrode should be measured.
The authors may have conducted the study with the noble indignation that the effect of high-
frequency electric field is ignored in the tissue sticking study and anti-sticking strategies. But the
truth may be that the effect of high-frequency electric field is intertwined with tissue adherence
and it is impossible to isolate the thermal and high-frequency electric field and assess the effect
on tissue sticking independently. It is the very thermo-electric coupling that underlies the
function of electrosurgical devices.

The authors have addressed most of the comments and conducted new experiments. There are
some issues that the authors need to address.
-The binding strengths were measured for both cutting test and heat-adherence test. The
geometries of the electrode vs. the soldering iron are considerably different. How did the author
7
perform tensile test for the samples of heat adherence test? Are the results comparable to each
other?
-In Table 1, the energy dissipations between the electrosurgical cutting test and heat-adherence
test are every different. The electrosurgical cutting test dissipated four times of energy. This
would significantly contribute to more sticking. How can the authors draw conclusions based on
such different energy dissipation? The authors would need to do a better control study.
-The authors should be aware that thermal camera can not measure the temperature very
accurately.

Title: Effect of high-frequency electric field on the tissue sticking of minimally
invasive electrosurgical devices
Royal Society Open Science
Reviewers' comments:
Reviewer #1:
Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript studied the sticking effect of a monopolar electrosurgical cutting
blade. The authors compared the sticking strength between a control study (heating
only) and an electrosurgical cutting test. Morphology and composition on the
electrode surface were also studied.
The study design has some flaw or lack of details in the text. In order to identify the
effect of electric field, the authors used a “heat-adherence test” as the control by
heating the electrode to 260 degree C. However, the total energy consumption (i.e.
thermal energy) was not controlled between the electrosurgical cutting test and the
heat-adherence test. It is very likely that more energy was introduced to the tissue
during the electrosurgical cutting test. The tissue has considerable higher heat
capacity than stainless steel, the electrode material. In the heat-adherence test, the
heat from the heated electrode would quickly dissipate to the tissue. It’s unclear that
the control and experimental groups had similar temperature profiles. Did the author
maintain the electrode temperature at 260 for 10 mins? Or just did the author just heat
the electrode to 260 and then insert to the tissue? Why 10 mins? From the
reviewer’s point of view, it’s very likely that the electrosurgical cutting test had more
thermal energy input and thus contribute to the stronger sticking. In this case, we
cannot have a direct comparison between the control and experimental groups and
thus it’s unclear if the difference is caused purely by the effect of electric field. The
information about temperature or thermal energy is critical to the comparison and is
missing in this study.
Answer: Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We do agree that in order to
identify the effect of electric field, the thermal energy input should be controlled
between the electrosurgical cutting test and the heat-adherence test. In the revised
version, a new “heat-adherence test” was designed and used as the control based on
reviewers' suggestions, and all the results related to control test were updated. And the
experimental details of the electrosurgical cutting test were added.
We apologized for the errors in temperature measurement in the original manuscript.
The temperature distribution in the porcine liver tissue around the electrode during the
electrosurgical cutting test was measured repeatedly using an infrared thermal
imaging camera, and the tissue temperature near the active electrode was measured to
be about 347 ºC under the given cutting condition, which were consistent with the
description of electrosurgery manual (KLS Martin Group, Tuttlingen, Germany). It is
noted in the manual that during the process of electrosurgery, the temperature in the
biological tissue was demonstrated to be more than 300 ºC in a variety of
measurement arrangements. We found that when an electrode, which was heated and
maintained at 350 ºC using a soldering iron, was directly in contact with a porcine
liver slice (about 0.5 mm in thickness), the tissue temperature profile around the
electrode was almost the same as the electrosurgical cutting test under the given
condition of this study. So, we redesigned a control test. For the control group,
porcine liver slices with a size of about 25×10×0.5 mm, which were made from ex
vivo fresh porcine liver, were used as tissue samples. The front end of electrode, about
10 mm long, was scissored and fixed onto a soldering iron with temperature control. It
was firstly heated and maintained at 350 ºC, and then directly in contact with porcine
liver slice. The tissue temperature near the electrode was measured to be about 345 ºC.
The heat-adherence test lasted about 40 s. For each electrosurgical cutting test, the
cutting time was 40 s. As a result, both the starting tissue morphology and thermal
energy input were approximately the same for the control and experimental groups in
the revised version, and then their results were comparable.
In section 1, paragraph 1 and line 5, the text has been modified as “A heat-adherence
test without electric field was used as a control. For the control group, the electrode
was heated and maintained at a certain temperature and directly in contact with
porcine liver.”
In section 2, paragraph 4 and line 2, the text has been modified as “For comparison, a
heat-adherence test without the influence of electric field, was designed by heating
and maintaining an electrode at a certain temperature and then putting it in contact
with porcine liver.”
In section 3.1, paragraph 1 and line 3, the text has been modified as “Porcine liver
chunks with a size of about 80×50×20 mm were used for the electrosurgical cutting
test, while porcine liver slices with a size of about 25×10×0.5 mm were used to do the
control test.”
In section 3.2, paragraph 1 and line 4, the text has been modified as “All the tests
were finished under the cutting power of 50 W, the cutting speed of 8 mm/s and the
incision depth of 10 mm. In order to form obvious sticking tissue upon active
electrode, for each cutting test, the total cutting length was 320 mm, and the effective
cutting time was 40 s. To better simulate the real cutting condition in electrosurgery,
the choice of these parameters was based on clinical experience.”
In section 3.3, paragraph 1 and line 1, the text has been modified as “In order to reveal
whether the high-frequency electric field has an influence on the adhesion of tissue to
electrodes or not, a heat-adherence test without electric field was designed as the
control. For the control group, the front end of electrode, about 10 mm long, was
scissored and fixed onto a soldering iron with temperature control, as shown in Figure
2. It was firstly heated and maintained at 350 ºC, and then directly in contact with
porcine liver slice. The temperature distribution in the porcine liver tissue around the
electrode was measured using an infrared thermal imaging camera, and the tissue
temperature near the electrode was about 345 ºC (Figure 2.c). The heat-adherence test
lasted about 40 s. During the electrosurgical cutting mentioned above, the tissue
temperature near the active electrode was about 347 ºC (Figure 2.d).”
In section 4.1, paragraph 1 and line 4, the text has been modified as “… after the
electrosurgical cutting test, while the covering on the electrode after the
heat-adherence test was porous and honeycomb-like.”
In section 4.1, paragraph 3 and line 2, the text has been modified as “The sticking
tissue consisted of tightly packed nanometre particles of equable size and seemed to
be contact. For the heat-adherence test, …, and the sticking tissue was comprised of
loose aggregated biggish nano-particles of unequal size and was porous.”
In section 4.2, paragraph 2 and line 18, the text has been modified as “… binding
strength … critical tensile force of 8.6 N was …”
In section 5, paragraph 2 and line 1, the following text has been added “Efforts were
made to ensure the two test results comparable. Firstly, porcine liver chunks and slices,
which were made from ex vivo fresh porcine liver, were used as tissue samples for the
electrosurgical cutting test and heat-adherence test, respectively. Hence, the starting
tissue morphologies of the two tests were same. Secondly, the tissue temperature
profile around the electrode was approximately the same for the control and
experimental groups (Figure 2). Due to the considerably high heat capacity of porcine
liver tissue, the temperature distribution in the tissue around the electrode is closely
associated with the thickness of tissue sample. Our preliminary experiment results
showed that for the heat-adherence test, when an electrode sample, which was heated
and maintained at 350 ºC, was directly in contact with a porcine liver slice with a
thickness of 0.5 mm, the tissue temperature near the electrode was almost the same as
the electrosurgical cutting test under the given condition of this study. Additionally,
the duration of action was the same for the two tests. As a result, both the starting
tissue morphology and thermal energy input were similar for the control and
experimental groups in the present study, and then their results were comparable.”
In the revised version, “Figure 2 Schematic diagrams of heat-adherence test and
thermographs” was added, and all the pictures, spectrums and data related to the
control test were replaced with new results in Figures 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, and Table 1.
Other comments:
-The experiential setup could be explained in more detailed and some pictures of the
setup would help the reader to understand how the experiment is conducted. Ex:
how long is the cutting path? The testing sample for binding strength is also not
very clear.
Answer: In the revised version, the experimental details of electrosurgical cutting test
and the schematic representation of tensile test samples’ preparation were added as
suggested.
In section 3.2, paragraph 1 and line 4, the text has been modified as “All the tests
were finished under the cutting power of 50 W, the cutting speed of 8 mm/s and the
incision depth of 10 mm. In order to form obvious sticking tissue upon active
electrode, for each cutting test, the total cutting length was 320 mm, and the effective
cutting time was 40 s. To better simulate the real cutting condition in electrosurgery,
the choice of these parameters was based on clinical experience.”
In section 3.4, paragraph 1 and line 2, the text has been modified as “After the
electrosurgical cutting test, the front ends of active electrodes covered with sticking
tissue, about 10 mm long, were scissored, and ground unilaterally using abrasive
paper to remove the sticking tissue on its lower surface, as shown in Figure 3. The
electrodes with the sticking tissue on upper surface were embedded with acrylic
structural adhesive, and then ground to obtain tensile testing samples with a testing
area of 8.0×2.0 mm.”
In the revised version, “Figure 3 Schematic representation of tensile test samples’
preparation” was added.
-The histological analysis didn’t add much information to the study.
Answer: In order to verify the source of the sticking tissue upon the electrode, the
histological example of incision in porcine liver tissue sample after the electrosurgical
cutting test was remained in the revised version, and meanwhile, the smoke arisen
around the incision during electrosurgical cutting was collected and examined.
In section 4.3, the caption has been modified as “Tissue section and smoke analysis”.
In section 4.3, paragraph 2 and line 1, the following text has been added “It should be
noted that a great deal of smoke arose around the incision during electrosurgical
cutting. In order to define the correlation between the smoke and sticking tissue upon
electrodes, an electrode heated and maintained at 350 ºC was put close to the incision
during the electrosurgical cutting so as to collect the smoke. The SEM micrograph
and EDX spectrum of the electrode surface after smoke collection are given in Figure
10. It was observed that the carbonized particles from the collected smoke were fine
nanoparticles of uniform size. The size of these particles was comparable with the
smallish particles in the sticking tissue formed during the electrosurgical cutting test
(Figure 6.a), and their chemical composition was similar to that of the sticking tissue.”
-The written language could be improved.
Answer: We have gone through the paper and improved the written language.
Reviewer #2:
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have presented original research investigation and drawn attention to the
role of high-frequency electric field in the tissue sticking problem of minimally
invasive electrosurgical devices. However there are serious concerns about the study
design and the control test that would cast doubt on the interpretation and conclusion
of the study.
1. Tissue sample preparation is different for the electrosurgical cutting test vs. the
heat-adherence control test: porcine liver chunks with a size of about 80×50×20 mm
for the cutting test vs. grinding liver slurry for the control test. Why wasn’t the same
sample preparation used for both tests? The different sample preparation introduced
different starting tissue morphology that would cast doubt on the origin of the
resulting loose and porous microstructure on the electrode after the control
heat-adherence test and compromise the interpretation. If the purpose is to reveal the
effect of high-frequency electric field on tissue sticking, one should try to maintain
the same conditions including sample preparation.
Answer: Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We do agree that different sample
preparation might introduce different starting tissue morphology that would cast doubt
on the origin of the resulting loose and porous microstructure on the electrode after
the control heat-adherence test and compromise the interpretation. In the revised
version, a new “heat-adherence test” was designed and used as the control based on
reviewers' suggestions, and all the results of control test were updated. For the control
group, porcine liver slices with a size of about 25×10×0.5 mm were used as tissue
samples, while porcine liver chunks with a size of about 80×50×20 mm were used for
the electrosurgical cutting test. Both porcine liver chunks and slices were made from
ex vivo fresh porcine liver. Thus, the starting tissue morphologies of the two tests
were same.
In section 3.1, paragraph 1 and line 3, the text has been modified as “Porcine liver
chunks with a size of about 80×50×20 mm were used for the electrosurgical cutting
test, while porcine liver slices with a size of about 25×10×0.5 mm were used to do the
control test.”
In section 4.1, paragraph 1 and line 4, the text has been modified as “… after the
electrosurgical cutting test, while the covering on the electrode after the
heat-adherence test was porous and honeycomb-like.”
In section 4.1, paragraph 3 and line 2, the text has been modified as “The sticking
tissue consisted of tightly packed nanometre particles of equable size and seemed to
be contact. For the heat-adherence test, …, and the sticking tissue was comprised of
loose aggregated biggish nano-particles of unequal size and was porous.”
In section 4.2, paragraph 2 and line 18, the text has been modified as “… binding
strength … critical tensile force of 8.6 N was …”
In the revised version, “Figure 2 Schematic diagrams of heat-adherence test and
thermographs” was added, and all the pictures, spectrums and data related to the
control test were updated with new results in Figures 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, and Table 1.
2. Based on the information given (The cutting depth of 10 mm was finished under
the cutting power of 50 W and the cutting speed of 8 mm/s), the cutting test for each
cut lasted about 1.25 s. The control test by submerging the hot electrodes in the
grinding slurry lasted about 10 min to form sticking tissue upon active electrode.
Later surface analysis showed that the surface morphologies of the layer of sticking
tissue were different. So besides the different starting tissue morphology for the
cutting and control test, the duration of action is also different. With the sensitive
surface characterization technique, would it be possible to examine the surface
morphology of electrode for the control test at the comparable time scale of action
(seconds rather than minutes)?
Answer: We are very sorry to make you feel confused about the duration of cutting.
For each cutting test, the incision depth is 10 mm, while the total cutting length was
320 mm, and the cutting speed was 8 mm/s. Thus, the effective cutting time was 40 s.
In the revised version, the experimental details of electrosurgical cutting test were
added.
We do agree with your viewpoint that the duration of action should be at the
comparable time scale for the experimental and control groups. As mentioned above,
a new “heat-adherence test” was designed and used as the control in the revised
version. The heat-adherence test lasted about 40 s. As a result, the duration of action
was the same for the two tests. All the pictures, spectrums and data related to the
control test were updated with new results in Figures 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, and Table 1.
In section 3.2, paragraph 1 and line 4, the text has been modified as “All the tests
were finished under the cutting power of 50 W, the cutting speed of 8 mm/s and the
incision depth of 10 mm. In order to form obvious sticking tissue upon active
electrode, for each cutting test, the total cutting length was 320 mm, and the effective
cutting time was 40 s. To better simulate the real cutting condition in electrosurgery,
the choice of these parameters was based on clinical experience.”
In section 3.3, paragraph 1 and line 6, the text has been modified as “The
heat-adherence test lasted about 40 s.”
3. The authors ensured the active electrode for the cutting and control tests having the
same temperature (260 <U+2103>). However, tissue temperatures near the active electrodes
were not measured which would be different for the two tests due to different heating
mechanisms and would affect tissue sticking. To be rigorous, not only the
temperature of the active electrode but also the tissue temperature profile around the
electrode should be measured.
Answer: Firstly, we apologized for the errors in temperature measurement in the
original manuscript. The temperature distribution in the porcine liver tissue around the
electrode during the electrosurgical cutting test was measured repeatedly using an
infrared thermal imaging camera, and the tissue temperature near the active electrode
was measured to be about 347 ºC under the given cutting condition, which were
consistent with the description of electrosurgery manual (KLS Martin Group,
Tuttlingen, Germany). It is noted in the manual that during the process of
electrosurgery, the temperature in the biological tissue was demonstrated to be more
than 300 ºC in a variety of measurement arrangements.
We found that when an electrode, which was heated and maintained at 350 ºC using a
soldering iron, was directly in contact with a porcine liver slice (about 0.5 mm in
thickness), the tissue temperature profile around the electrode was almost the same as
the electrosurgical cutting test under the given condition of this study. So, we
redesigned a control test. For the control group, porcine liver slices with a size of
about 25×10×0.5 mm, which were made from ex vivo fresh porcine liver, were used
as tissue samples. The front end of electrode, about 10 mm long, was scissored and
fixed onto a soldering iron with temperature control. It was firstly heated and
maintained at 350 ºC, and then directly in contact with porcine liver slice. The tissue
temperature near the electrode was measured to be about 345 ºC. It seemed that the
tissue temperature profile around the electrode were approximately the same for the
control and experimental groups in the revised version.
In section 3.3, paragraph 1 and line 1, the text has been modified as “In order to reveal
whether the high-frequency electric field has an influence on the adhesion of tissue to
electrodes or not, a heat-adherence test without electric field was designed as the
control. For the control group, the front end of electrode, about 10 mm long, was
scissored and fixed onto a soldering iron with temperature control, as shown in Figure
2. It was firstly heated and maintained at 350 ºC, and then directly in contact with
porcine liver slice. The temperature distribution in the porcine liver tissue around the
electrode was measured using an infrared thermal imaging camera, and the tissue
temperature near the electrode was about 345 ºC (Figure 2.c). The heat-adherence test
lasted about 40 s. During the electrosurgical cutting mentioned above, the tissue
temperature near the active electrode was about 347 ºC (Figure 2.d).”
The authors may have conducted the study with the noble indignation that the effect
of high-frequency electric field is ignored in the tissue sticking study and anti-sticking
strategies. But the truth may be that the effect of high-frequency electric field is
intertwined with tissue adherence and it is impossible to isolate the thermal and
high-frequency electric field and assess the effect on tissue sticking independently.
It is the very thermo-electric coupling that underlies the function of electrosurgical
devices.
Answer: There exist both thermal field and high-frequency electric field at the
interface between the electrode and targeted tissue during electrosurgery, but almost
all the current anti-sticking approaches do not take into account the effect of
high-frequency electric field. As a result, although high-frequency electric field is the
principal energy source for electrosurgical cutting, its influence on the adhesion of
tissue to electrodes is little known up to now. As the reviewer mentioned, during
electrosurgery, it is impossible to isolate the thermal and high-frequency electric field
and assess the effect of high-frequency electric field on tissue sticking independently.
So, in the present study, electrosurgical cutting test was used as experimental group,
while a heat-adherence test without the influence of electric field was designed as the
control, aiming to investigate the effect of high-frequency electric field on tissue
sticking. Efforts were made to ensure the two test results comparable.
Our results suggested that due to the influence of high-frequency electric field, the
tissue is fragmented to fine nano-particles, accelerated, and then impact against the
electrode during the process of electrosurgical cutting. The high-frequency electric
field plays an extremely important role in the formation of the sticking tissue with
compact microstructure and high binding strength. Hence, the effect of
high-frequency electric field cannot be ignored in the tissue sticking study and
anti-sticking strategies, otherwise, the anti-sticking effect might compromise greatly.
In section 1, line 13, the text has been modified as “In sum, high-frequency electric
field plays an extremely important role in the formation of the sticking tissue with
compact microstructure and high binding strength. It is the very thermo-electric
coupling that underlies the function of minimally invasive electrosurgical devices, and
thus the effect of high-frequency electric field cannot be ignored in the tissue sticking
study and anti-sticking strategies.”
In section 5, paragraph 2 and line 1, the following text has been added “Efforts were
made to ensure the two test results comparable. Firstly, porcine liver chunks and slices,
which were made from ex vivo fresh porcine liver, were used as tissue samples for the
electrosurgical cutting test and heat-adherence test, respectively. Hence, the starting
tissue morphologies of the two tests were same. Secondly, the tissue temperature
profile around the electrode was approximately the same for the control and
experimental groups (Figure 2). Due to the considerably high heat capacity of porcine
liver tissue, the temperature distribution in the tissue around the electrode is closely
associated with the thickness of tissue sample. Our preliminary experiment results
showed that for the heat-adherence test, when an electrode sample, which was heated
and maintained at 350 ºC, was directly in contact with a porcine liver slice with a
thickness of 0.5 mm, the tissue temperature near the electrode was almost the same as
the electrosurgical cutting test under the given condition of this study. Additionally,
the duration of action was the same for the two tests. As a result, both the starting
tissue morphology and thermal energy input were similar for the control and
experimental groups in the present study, and then their results were comparable.”
In section 5, paragraph 8 and line 1, the text has been modified as “In fact, there
always exists high-frequency electric field in electrosurgery. It causes the tissue to be
fragmented to fine nano-particles and accelerated, and then impact against the
electrode. Hence, once texture size is bigger than the size of these nano-particles, the
anti-sticking effect of the hydrophobic surface texture on electrode surface, would
come down. And moreover, the high-speed impact of these particles on the electrode
could weaken the anti-sticking effect of protective layers such as steam bubbles
produced by cold saline irrigation, destroy the hydrophobic coating/surface texture on
electrode surface, and contribute to the high binding strength of sticking tissue. This
might be the possible reason why the current anti-sticking measures only alleviate
tissue sticking to a certain degree, but cannot settle this matter ultimately. The results
of the present study suggested that high-frequency electric field plays an extremely
important role in the formation of the sticking tissue with compact microstructure and
high binding strength. It is the very thermo-electric coupling that underlies the
function of minimally invasive electrosurgical devices, and thus the effect of
high-frequency electric field cannot be ignored in the tissue sticking study and
anti-sticking strategies.”
In section 6, paragraph 3 and line 1, the text has been modified as “2) High-frequency
electric field plays an extremely important role in the formation of the sticking tissue
with compact microstructure and high binding strength. It is the very thermo-electric
coupling that underlies the function of minimally invasive electrosurgical devices, and
thus the effect of high-frequency electric field cannot be ignored in the tissue sticking
study and anti-sticking strategies.”
Finally, we appreciate very much the careful comments from the reviewers which
helped us a lot in improving the quality of this manuscript. All the changes in the text
have been marked in red for highlight.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have addressed most of the comments and conducted new
experiments. There are some issues that the authors need to address.
-The binding strengths were measured for both cutting test and
heat-adherence test. The geometries of the electrode vs. the soldering iron are
considerably different. How did the author perform tensile test for the samples
of heat adherence test? Are the results comparable to each other?
Answer: For the control group, an electrode (about 10 mm long) was fixed onto the
surface of a soldering iron to do heat-adherence test. After the heat-adherence test, the
electrode was taken off from the soldering iron to do tensile test on a material testing
machine so as to measure the binding strength of sticking tissue on the electrode. Both
the tensile sample preparation, testing area, and testing condition were kept to be
approximately the same for the electrode samples obtained from cutting test and
heat-adherence test. So, their results are comparable to each other.
A detailed description about tensile sample preparation after the heat-adherence test
has been added in the revised version.
In section 3.4, paragraph 1 and line 5, the following text has been added “After the
heat-adherence test, the electrode was taken off from the soldering iron, embedded,
and then ground to obtain tensile testing sample, as shown in Figure 3. For all the
tensile samples, the testing area was 8.0×2.0 mm, and the tensile test speed was 0.5
mm/min.”
-In Table 1, the energy dissipations between the electrosurgical cutting test
and heat-adherence test are every different. The electrosurgical cutting test
dissipated four times of energy. This would significantly contribute to more
sticking. How can the authors draw conclusions based on such different
energy dissipation? The authors would need to do a better control study.
Answer: The energy dissipations in Table 1 were measured using vertical tension
method after either the electrosurgical cutting test or the heat-adherence test rather
than during the two tests. It refers to the energy per unit area consumed for pulling the
sticking tissue off the electrode surface after these two tests. The higher the energy
dissipation is, the bigger the binding strength of sticking tissue with electrode surface
is. We are very sorry to make you feel confused about the energy dissipation provided
in Table 1. In the revised version, the caption of Table 1 has been modified as “Tensile
properties of sticking tissue-electrode interface after electrosurgical cutting test and
heat-adherence test”, and some descriptions in Table 1 also have been modified so as
to make the statement more accurately.
In section 4.2, paragraph 1 and line 1, the text has been modified as “The tensile
properties of sticking tissue-electrode interface, such as critical force, binding strength
and energy dissipation, are much higher after the electrosurgical cutting test than after
the heat-adherence test, as shown in Table 1.”
In addition, we apologize for filling in the column of "After electrosurgical sutting
test" in Table 1 with wrong data. It was a mistake caused by our negligence. Different
cutting time from 10 s to 40 s was used at the first onset of this study. We finally
adopted the results of 40 s according to cooperative surgeon's suggestion in order to
better simulate the real cutting condition of electrosurgery and form apparent sticking
tissue upon active electrode. However, in the initial manuscript, Table 1 gives the
tensile properties of sticking tissue-electrode interface after 10 s cutting test rather
than after 40 s cutting test. In the revised version, the tensile properties of sticking
tissue-electrode interface after electrosurgical cutting test have been replaced by the
results after 40 s cutting test in Table 1. The following Table gives the results after 10
s cutting test and 40 s cutting test for your reference.
Table: Tensile properties of sticking tissue-electrode interface after electrosurgical cutting test and
heat-adherence test
After electrosurgical cutting test
After heat-adherence test
10 s 40 s
Critical force F0 (N) 45.7±7.6 133.4±19.8 8.6±2.3
Binding strength s (MPa) 2.85±0.58 8.34±0.89 0.53±0.14
Energy dissipation Ea (10-3 J/mm2) 0.73±0.17 5.56±0.57 0.18±0.07
-The authors should be aware that thermal camera can not measure the
temperature very accurately.
Answer: We do agree with the reviewer. Thermal camera can not measure the
temperature very accurately, which is influenced by many factors, such as reflective
characteristics of samples, measurement distance and angle, environment moisture,
etc. In this study, thermal camera was used to keep the temperature distribution in the
porcine liver tissue approximately the same for the experimental and control groups.
The temperature distributions in the porcine liver tissue of the experimental and
control groups were measured under same testing conditions. That is, the error level
of temperature measurement is basically the same for the experimental and control
groups.
In section 3.3, paragraph 1 and line 5, the text has been modified as “The temperature
distribution in the porcine liver tissue around the electrode was measured using an
infrared thermal imaging camera and then controlled to be approximately the same for
the control and experimental groups. The tissue temperature near the electrode was
measured to be about 345 ºC for the control (Figure 2.c) and 347 ºC for the
electrosurgical cutting group (Figure 2.d), respectively.”
