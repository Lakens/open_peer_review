It is a very interesting study on how bromocresol green modifications of pencil electrodes
improve the determination of pantoprazol. Many parameters have been studied. The sensor was
applied in challenging real samples like blood plasma, and even a pharmacokinetic study in
rabbit was conducted. Analytical performance is quite impressive. The LOD of 22 nM is
supported by the data.
I recommend publication after a minor revision:
A) Figure and Table captions should provide more information. The minimum is measurement
parameters (e.g. on voltammetry: scan rates, times, frequency, amplitude, as appropriate) and
sample composition.
B) Data set was treated by statistical evaluation in the text and tables. However, error bars should
be provided in Fig. 3, 6, 8.
C) The English could be further polished.
D) Section 4.6.2: The data should be validated using an independent method such as HPLC. At
least, the authors should provide some comparison with literature: How does the time profile
compare to reported pharmacokinetics of this drug?

5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal

This needs attention.

Appendix A
Development of a novel redox sensor for voltammetric determination of
pantoprazole sodium during pharmacokinetic studies
Comments to the Authors:
The paper presents an electrochemical sensor based on graphite electrode modified with poly
bromocresol green). It seems that the authors showed many interesting results. Considering
he novelty of the paper, I think it might be published on “Royal Society Open Science” after
major revision. Before accepting the paper, I recommend the authors to improve the paper as
ollows:
1. Why the linear range is different between Fig. 7 (15-180×10-8 M) and Table 1 (40-
350x10-8 M)? The error bars should be added to calibration plot.
2. The authors evaluated the scan rate study in the range from 30 to 150 mV s-1 (Page
11, Line 6). However, the authors were obtained more results as shown in Fig. 6B.
Therefore, the graph related to scan rate study in all obtained scan rate value and
related regression equation should be added.
3. The deposition time and potential results for PAN analysis should be added to
manuscript with an error bar. And, more discussions about deposition step should be
added.
4. As seen in Table 6, Glassy carbon electrode (GCE) developed by Elsied and et. al
superior analytical performance compared to proposed Poly(BGE)/PGE. Therefore,
the authors should be presented the superiority of proposed electrochemical sensor
in terms of analytical perspective. And, the authors should check the more literatures
for the detection of PAN sodium. (Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis
33 (2003) 687-692; Analytical Letters, 38: 1389–1404, 2005).
5. The authors should carefully check the manuscript for English language errors.

Done as requested.
2-The authors evaluated the scan rate study in the range from 30 to 150 mV s-1 (Page11,
Line 6). However, the authors were obtained more results as shown in Fig. 6B.Therefore,
the graph related to scan rate study in all obtained scan rate value andrelated regression
equation should be added.
Done as requested.
3- The deposition time and potential results for PAN analysis should be added
tomanuscript with an error bar. And, more discussions about deposition step should be
added.
Done as requested.
4- As seen in Table 6, Glassy carbon electrode (GCE) developed by Elsied and et.

5- The authors should carefully check the manuscript for English language errors.
English language errors have been corrected throughout the whole manuscript.
Reviewer 2:

as appropriate) and sample composition.
Done as requested.
2- Data set was treated by statistical evaluation in the text and tables. However, error
bars should be provided in Fig. 3, 6, 8.

3- The English could be further polished.
Done as requested.
4- Section 4.6.2: The data should be validated using an independent method such as
HPLC. At least, the authors should provide some comparison with literature: How does
the time profile compare to reported pharmacokinetics of this drug?
To the best of our knowledge, the available HPLC data in the literature was for human plasma and
not for rabbit plasma.
5- There was, some trouble with the link provided on page 16, line 6.
Corrected.
