Dear authors,
The specific insights into the exceptional role of ethanolamine on the morphological evolution of
Bi2WO6 sheets and further assembling into flower-like structure are explained in detail. The
further discussions related to the shifting of band edge positions, photoluminescence
spectroscopy and Mott-Schottky plots that substantiates the influence of ethanolamine are the
other interesting aspects. However, few clarifications and thorough language editing are still
essential for improved understanding.
Major comments
(1) The recycling ability of the photocatalyst may be discussed.
Minor comments
Title: It may be modified for reader’s attention (up to the author’s choice): (i) Pivotal role of
ethanolamine on the structure-electronic and photocatalytic properties of flower-like Bi2WO6; (ii)
Role of ethanolamine on the morphological evolution of 3-D flower like Bi2WO6 photocatalyst by
microwave method; (iii) Formation mechanism of ethanolamine assisted 3-D flower like Bi2WO6
photocatalyst under microwave irradiation; (iv) 3-D flower like Bi2WO6: Insight into the role of
ethanolamine on the formation mechanisms and photocatalytic property.
Abstract
(1) Indicate the reaction temperature and time within the parenthesis after the sentence
(microwave method) and specify concentration of ethanolamine for clarity.
(2) The role of ethanolamine in altering the pressure of the reaction and on the crystallization of
Bi2WO6 must be highlighted.
(3) The results derived from materials characterization should be briefly emphasized.
Section 1.0
(1) Modify the starting phrase ‘In recently, …. pollution'! (avoid using pollution twice in the same
phrase).
(1) Add few review articles related to Bi2WO6 along with ref. [2,3]: Applied Surface Science 355
(2015) 939-958; Catalysis Science and Technology 2 (2012) 694-706; Chemical Society Reviews 43
(2014) 5276-5287.
(2) Remove ‘more than 10 hours’ and generalize as ‘longer time’, while discussing hydrothermal
method.
Section 2.1
(1) The preparative method should be detailed out completely to ensure reproducibility: (i)
volume of Bi precursors and tungstate precursors taken should be indicated; (ii) concentration of
ethanolamine must be specified.
(2) The apparatus in which these solutions were mixed must be indicated.
(3) The samples may be abbreviated as ‘EA:X’ instead of ‘EA X’.
Section 2.3
(1) The details of excitation source including its intensity, wavelength maxima and distance
3
between light source and solution surface must be provided.
(2) Specify the solution pH at which degradation reaction were carried out.
Section 3.1
(1) The effect on pressure on the reaction speed as referenced from literature [15,16] may be
briefly explained.
(2) The viscosity of the ethanolamine-water mixture (EA 1-1 to EA 7-1) may be supplemented for
more understanding.
Section 3.2
(1) The XRD studies requires few clarifications: (i) is it possible to observe crystallized Bi2O3 if
only Bi precursor are used in the similar experimental condition?; (ii) reflections of Bi2O3 and
Bi2WO6 in the XRD patterns may be distinguished using symbols (like, asterisk ‘*’ for Bi2O3); (iii)
can pure Bi2WO6 formation is feasible if reaction time is prolonged for EA 1-1?.
(2) Typo: ration!
Section 3.6
(1) devolved!
Section 3.8
(1) The phrase ‘excessive –NH2 makes Bi3+ reduced to Bi0’ may be supported with suitable
literature.
(2) It should be ‘adsorbed –OH groups’ instead of ‘absorbed’!
Conclusion
(1) The significant results obtained highlighting the role of ethanolamine may be presented.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In this manuscript, the 3D flower-like Bi2WO6 was synthesized with the assist of ethanolamine
through one-step microwave method and evaluated the photocatalytic property of samples. The
results showed that the ethanolamine significantly influenced the morphology of Bi2WO6
products and improved the photocatalytic efficiency. Overall this topic is interesting, and the
results were presented satisfactorily. However, some parts of the manuscript were not presented
well, and revisions are needed prior to a possible publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Detailed comments are listed as follows:
1. on Abstract: the authors should provide the detailed results and conclusions, and describe
briefly if and how the structure and catalytic performance of Bi2WO6 change with the assist of
ethanolamine.
2. On 1st paragraph: Better background information on microwave applications and organic
pollutant removal by other methods including advanced oxidation and biological processes
should be presented to the prospective audiences, and these following recent articles in this field
could serve this purpose in some aspects: Scientific Reports, 2017, 7(1): 1668 (p1-8); Chemical
Engineering Journal, 2018, 341: 126-136; Chemical Engineering Journal, 2018, 353: 533-541;
Chemosphere, 2018, 200: 380-387; Bioresource Technology, 2018, 260: 196-203.
3. On 2nd paragraph: The use of photocatalysis for organic pollutants has received much
interests. More recent articles on this topic should be reviewed, for example: Microstructure and
performance of Z-scheme photocatalyst of silver phosphate modified by MWCNTs and Cr-doped
SrTiO3 for malachite green degradation. Applied Catalysis B Environmental, 2018, 227: 557-570.
4. On 3rd paragraph: Major properties of the model pollutant “methyl orange” should be
mentioned. Why MO was selected as the model pollutant?
5. Line 48-53 in Page 3: The authors should consider to list some typical long chain compounds,
compare them with ethanolamine, and describe the advantages and disadvantages.
6. In section 2.1, the symbol for temperature should be presented in an accepted style.
7. Line 30-41 in Page 6: Viscosity of EA is much higher than that of water, which could affect the
mass transfer rate for ions in the system. This claim needs more reliable explanations and
experimental evidences or data.
8. Line 25-27 in Page 7: More explanations and evidences including literature citation for “the
high dispersion of EA makes the precursor sodium tungstate and bismuth nitrate to be fully in
contact, thus contributing to the formation of Bi2WO6” are needed. The following literature could
be referred for the dispersion: Influences of anion concentration and valence on dispersion and
aggregation of titanium dioxide nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. Journal of Environmental
Sciences, 2017, 54: 135-141.
9. Fig.2 shows that the EA 2-1 sample has the highest purity and crystallinity, but the authors
only compared EA 7-1 to EA 5-1, indicated that the EA 7-1 sample has a higher purity and
crystallinity. That comparison and explanation is incomplete and cannot support the following
conclusion. In addition, the XRD spectra of ethanolamine should be provided to eliminate its
effects for the crystal phase and structure of Bi2WO6.
5
10. Line 47-56 in Page 7: The authors should edit this manuscript more carefully. Such as Line 52-
53 in Page 7, the clerical error in the sentence “This result proves that EA 2-1 is a mixture of two
substances, which is consistent with the XRD result”. it should be EA 1-1, not EA 2-1.
11. Line 55 in Page 8: The sentence “The surface area of all the samples is similar, shown in Table
1, which can indicate that the difference in adsorption capacity is not caused by the BET
difference” should be placed in section 3.7 to explain the difference in adsorption capacity.
12. Line 3-19 in Page 11: the amount of EA could promote the increased atomic ratio of OS in
Bi2WO6, the authors should explain it.
13. Line 55 in Page 9: in the paper, the values of band gaps of EA 0, EA 1-1, EA 2-1, EA 5-1 and
EA 7-1 were calculated in the Fig.5, and the variation of energy band positions were observed
from the XPS valence band spectra in the Fig.9. It’s better to write out the calculation. In order to
further confirm the energy band positions and its variation, other means, such as Mott-Schottky
calculation process should be also provided. The literature mentioned in Comment 3 could
provide such information.
14. On Conclusions: The results show that the addition of EA can improve the photocatalytic
activity of materials and the increase of the amount of EA, the photocatalytic activity gradually
increases. The author only compared the performances of EA 0, EA1-1, EA 2-1, EA 5-1 and EA 7-
1, while did not conclude how the photocatalytic activity change when EA was increased further.
Data on more higher proportion should be supplemented to find the optimal proportion, so as to
make the conclusion and research more valuable.

Appendix A
Dear Editor and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning
our manuscript entitled “The 3-D flower-like Bi2WO6 assisted by
ethanolamine through microwave method for efficiency photocatalytic
activity”. Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for
revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding
significance to our researches. We have studied comments carefully
and have made correction which we hope meet with approval. Revised
portion are marked in red in the paper. The main corrections in the
paper and the responds to the reviewer’s comments are as flowing:
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer #1:
1. Response to comment: Abstract(1) Indicate the reaction
temperature and time within the parenthesis after the sentence
(microwave method) and specify concentration of ethanolamine
for clarity. (2) The role of ethanolamine in altering the pressure of
the reaction and on the crystallization of Bi2WO6 must be
highlighted. (3) The results derived from materials characterization
should be briefly emphasized.
Response: We have made corrections according to the Reviewer’s
comments. All the corrections were written in red.
2. Response to comment: Section 1.0(1) Modify the starting phrase
‘In recently, …. pollution'! (avoid using pollution twice in the
same phrase). (1) Add few review articles related to Bi2WO6
along with ref. [2,3]: Applied Surface Science 355 (2015) 939-958;
Catalysis Science and Technology 2 (2012) 694-706; Chemical
Society Reviews 43 (2014) 5276-5287.(2) Remove ‘more than 10
hours’ and generalize as ‘longer time’, while discussing
hydrothermal method.
Response: We have made corrections according to the Reviewer’s
comments and mentioned references have been added. All the
corrections were written in red.
3. Response to comment: Section 2.1(1) The preparative method
should be detailed out completely to ensure reproducibility: (i)
volume of Bi precursors and tungstate precursors taken should be
indicated; (ii) concentration of ethanolamine must be specified. (2)
The apparatus in which these solutions were mixed must be
indicated. (3) The samples may be abbreviated as ‘EA:X’ instead
of ‘EA X’.
Response: Thank you for your comment. (1) (i) The amount of Bi
precursors and tungstate precursors has been shown in the paper,
which is 2 mmol and 1 mmol, respectively. (ii) the concentration of
used ethanolamine is about 99%, and which has been indicated in the
article. (2) The whole experiment was going on microwave reactor
(Biotage Sweden). No additional mixing apparatus were used. (3) We
have re-written this part according to the Reviewer’s suggestion. All
the corrections were written in red.
4. Response to comment: Section 2.3(1) The details of excitation
source including its intensity, wavelength maxima and distance
between light source and solution surface must be provided. (2)
Specify the solution pH at which degradation reaction were carried
out.
Response: The details of excitation source and the solution pH (pH=7)
have been added in the article, which were written in red.
5. Section 3.2(1) The XRD studies requires few clarifications: (i) is it
possible to observe crystallized Bi2O3 if only Bi precursor are
used in the similar experimental condition?; (ii) reflections of
Bi2O3 and Bi2WO6 in the XRD patterns may be distinguished
using symbols (like, asterisk ‘*’ for Bi2O3); (iii) can pure
Bi2WO6 formation is feasible if reaction time is prolonged for EA
1-1?.
(2) Typo: ration!
Response: (1) Thank you for your comment. (i) We have
supplemented this data. The crystallized Bi2O3 was obtained if
only Bi precursor is used in the similar experimental condition
(Fig.S1). (ii) We have re-written this part according to the Reviewer’s
suggestion. All the corrections were written in red. (iii) We have
supplemented this data. When the reaction time is prolonged for EA
1-1, the diffraction peaks characteristic of Bi2O3 gradually decreased,
and that of Bi2WO6 enhanced gradually (Fig.S2)
(2) We have re-written this part according to the Reviewer’s
suggestion. All the corrections were written in red.
6. Section 3.6 (1) devolved!
Response: We have re-written this part according to the Reviewer’s
suggestion. All the corrections were written in red.
7. Section 3.8(1) The phrase ‘excessive –NH2 makes Bi3+ reduced to
Bi0’ may be supported with suitable literature. (2) It should be
‘adsorbed –OH groups’ instead of ‘absorbed’!
Response:
(1) Thank you for your comment. Since –NH2 is reducible,excessive
–NH2 makes Bi3+ reduced to Bi0, Our experiments prove this point
(Fig. 11). In addition, we also added relevant references.
(2) We have re-written this part according to the Reviewer’s
suggestion. All the corrections were written in red.
8. Conclusion(1) The significant results obtained highlighting the role
of ethanolamine may be presented.
Response: The role of ethanolamine has been added in the article,
which was written in red.
Reviewer #2:
1. on Abstract: the authors should provide the detailed results and
conclusions, and describe briefly if and how the structure and
catalytic performance of Bi2WO6 change with the assist of
ethanolamine.
Response: We have re-written this part according to the Reviewer’s
suggestion. All the corrections were written in red.
2. On 1st paragraph: Better background information on microwave
applications and organic pollutant removal by other methods
including advanced oxidation and biological processes should be
presented to the prospective audiences, and these following recent
articles in this field could serve this purpose in some aspects:
Scientific Reports, 2017, 7(1): 1668 (p1-8); Chemical
Engineering Journal, 2018, 341: 126-136; Chemical Engineering
Journal, 2018, 353: 533-541; Chemosphere, 2018, 200: 380-387;
Bioresource Technology, 2018, 260: 196-203.
Response: We have made corrections according to the Reviewer’s
comments and mentioned references have been added. All the
corrections were written in red.
3. On 2nd paragraph: The use of photocatalysis for organic pollutants
has received much interests. More recent articles on this topic
should be reviewed, for example: Microstructure and
performance of Z-scheme photocatalyst of silver phosphate
modified by MWCNTs and Cr-doped SrTiO3 for malachite green
degradation. Applied Catalysis B Environmental, 2018, 227:
557-570.
Response: We have made corrections according to the Reviewer’s
comments and mentioned references have been added. All the
corrections were written in red.
4. On 3rd paragraph: Major properties of the model pollutant “methyl
orange” should be mentioned. Why MO was selected as the model
pollutant?
Response: Thank you for your comment. Methyl orange (MO) is
stable and does not decompose under the action of light. Moreover, the
degradation rate of MO can be calculated by absorbance and
concentration standard curves. Therefore, MO is used us a model for
photocatalytic experiments. We have explained this point in the article.
All the corrections were written in red.
5. Line 48-53 in Page 3: The authors should consider to list some
typical long chain compounds, compare them with ethanolamine,
and describe the advantages and disadvantages.
Response: We have re-written this part according to the Reviewer’s
suggestion. All the corrections were written in red.
6. In section 2.1, the symbol for temperature should be presented in
an accepted style.
Response: We have made corrections according to the Reviewer’s
comments. All the corrections were written in red.
7. Line 30-41 in Page 6: Viscosity of EA is much higher than that of
water, which could affect the mass transfer rate for ions in the
system. This claim needs more reliable explanations and
experimental evidences or data.
Response:Thank you for your comment. We have added the relevant
references have been added (25). All the corrections were written in
red.
8. Line 25-27 in Page 7: More explanations and evidences including
literature citation for “the high dispersion of EA makes the
precursor sodium tungstate and bismuth nitrate to be fully in
contact, thus contributing to the formation of Bi2WO6” are needed.
The following literature could be referred for the dispersion:
Influences of anion concentration and valence on dispersion and
aggregation of titanium dioxide nanoparticles in aqueous solutions.
Journal of Environmental Sciences, 2017, 54: 135-141.
Response: We have made corrections according to the Reviewer’s
comments and mentioned references have been added. All the
corrections were written in red.
9. Fig.2 shows that the EA 2-1 sample has the highest purity and
crystallinity, but the authors only compared EA 7-1 to EA 5-1,
indicated that the EA 7-1 sample has a higher purity and
crystallinity. That comparison and explanation is incomplete and
cannot support the following conclusion. In addition, the XRD
spectra of ethanolamine should be provided to eliminate its effects
for the crystal phase and structure of Bi2WO6.
Response: Thank you for your comment. In this paper, we focus on the
3D flower-like structure. Seen from Fig.3, since only EA 5-1 and EA
7-1 samples formed the 3D flower-like structure, we only compared
EA 7-1 to EA 5-1. We have omitted the expression in this part in the
article. In addition, since EA is liquid at room temperature, the XRD
spectrum of which has no peak, there is no interference with the
crystal phase and structure of Bi2WO6. So we think it is not necessary
to supplement its XRD spectrum
10. Line 47-56 in Page 7: The authors should edit this manuscript
more carefully. Such as Line 52-53 in Page 7, the clerical error in
the sentence “This result proves that EA 2-1 is a mixture of two
substances, which is consistent with the XRD result”. it should be
EA 1-1, not EA 2-1.
Response: Thank you for your comment. We have made corrections
according to the Reviewer’s comments and mentioned references have
been added. All the corrections were written in red.
11. Line 55 in Page 8: The sentence “The surface area of all the
samples is similar, shown in Table 1, which can indicate that the
difference in adsorption capacity is not caused by the BET
difference” should be placed in section 3.7 to explain the
difference in adsorption capacity.
Response: Thank you for your comment. We have made corrections
according to the Reviewer’s comments and mentioned references have
been added. All the corrections were written in red.
12. Line 3-19 in Page 11: the amount of EA could promote the
increased atomic ratio of OS in Bi2WO6, the authors should
explain it.
Response: Thank you for your comment. The O 1s core level at 532.25
eV (OS) can be ascribed to the oxygen in –OH. EA molecules contain
active hydroxyl and secondary amino group. With the proportion of
EA increasing through hydrogen bonding, the association of –OH and
Bi2WO6 molecular becomes greater. So we think the amount of EA
could promote the increased atomic ratio of OS in Bi2WO6. We have
explained this reason in article 3.8.
13. Line 55 in Page 9: in the paper, the values of band gaps of EA 0,
EA 1-1, EA 2-1, EA 5-1 and EA 7-1 were calculated in the Fig.5,
and the variation of energy band positions were observed from the
XPS valence band spectra in the Fig.9. It’s better to write out the
calculation. In order to further confirm the energy band positions
and its variation, other means, such as Mott-Schottky calculation
process should be also provided. The literature mentioned in
Comment 3 could provide such information.
Response: Thank you for your comment. The XPS valence band
spectra of EA 7-1, EA 5-1 and EA 2-1, the VB potentials are 1.77 eV,
1.81 eV and 1.97 eV, respectively. In addition, as shown in Fig. 10, the
flat band potentials are estimated to be -0.67 V, -0.65 V, -0.59 V for
EA 2-1, EA 5-1 and EA 7-1 respectively. We have already explained
this in article.
14. On Conclusions: The results show that the addition of EA can
improve the photocatalytic activity of materials and the increase of
the amount of EA, the photocatalytic activity gradually increases.
The author only compared the performances of EA 0, EA1-1, EA
2-1, EA 5-1 and EA 7-1, while did not conclude how the
photocatalytic activity change when EA was increased further.
Data on more higher proportion should be supplemented to find the
optimal proportion, so as to make the conclusion and research
more valuable.
Response: Thank you for your comment. We have supplemented this
data, as shown in Fig.S4.
