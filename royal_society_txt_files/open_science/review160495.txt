This ms reports on a study in which juvenile and adult Senegalese sole were subjected to
different tests, individually and in groups, to assess their coping style in response to different
stressors (e.g. confinement, novelty, handling/flipping over).
As experimental readouts responses and response times are measured, as well as plasma cortisol,
glucose and lactate.
I find the rationale of the study well-derived. Senegalese sole suffers quite significant losses in
aquaculture settings, not only during breeding but also during metamorphosis of the larvae.
I have some major difficulties with the experimental design and data presentation/analysis.
In 3 out of 5 individual coping style tests, animals that do not show a response ("no movement" in
the new environment and confinement tests, or "no recovery" in the flipping over test) are
awarded a 300 or 180 s response time. This is arbitrary and subjective. Also, this treatment of non-
responsive animals is in contrast with the "group risk taking test" where animals that do not cross
from a safe to a risky zone are classified as "proactive" or "reactive", respectively.
Awarding non-existent response times of 300 and 180 s disturbs the statistical analysis. The
skewed frequency distributions in Fig. 4 are arteficial and in fact not bimodal but heavily skewed.
Animals that do not response should be identified as "non-responsive" and be labeled as a
separate group. It only makes sense to analyse response times of the responsive animals (which
statement is almost a tautology).
The tables fail to convey the message properly; I suggest to use boxplots and/or scatter plots to
display all individual data points.
I am also confused by the tables. For instance: Table 1, line 1 reports a NetActW (net activity time
in the water) of 14.8 ± 14.8 s (mean ± sd), and it is indicated that this is normally distributed. How
is this possible? Under a normal distribution, 99.7% of the observations are within 3 standard
deviations of the mean. This would mean that negative NetActW times are measured?
The authors aim at improving sole aquaculture by identifying favourable phenotypes for
breeding. It is unfortunate that the authors do not provide data on the heritability of the observed
coping styles. This could easily have been by first studying breeders, and then their offspring: a
simple reversal of the experimental organisation.

The work described in present manuscript investigates coping styles in Senegalese soles. The
group decided to test both juveniles and adults (breeders) by subjecting individuals through a
series of behavioural tests first in isolation and then in small groups. The main idea behind this
set of experiments is to corroborate the efficacy of the different proposed tests in identifying
coping styles in this species in order to propose an efficient cost-effective test that could be
employed by the aquaculture industry in order to incorporate coping styles into their practices
(e.g. welfare, breeding programs). The authors conducted 5 consecutive individual tests on 61
juveniles and 59 adults followed by a resting period of 15 days, after which they conducted 2
group tests. Importantly, coping styles have been proposed to be consistent over time and across
situations and by implementing and comparing several tests and on individuals at 2 different life
stages the authors are able to properly assess coping styles in their experiment. One can certainly
appreciate that the data set obtained from these behavioural experiments gives further insight
into coping styles in Senegalese sole and justifies the use of some of the employed tests. However,
I did find a series of issues with the methodology and not least the presentation and
interpretation of results in its current form. Regarding their main conclusions, I do not agree with
the implied novelty of their results. The authors found that the tests that gave the best results in
their experiment were the ones that in fact have been used the most in the same and other fish
species (they even include some of these studies in their references), the authors only confirmed
their usefulness. In addition, they claim that these are good, efficient tools for the aquaculture
industry, but a confinement and a new environment test are time consuming and not that
suitable for screening hundreds of individuals in a short time. Meanwhile, the restraining test is
less time consuming and requires relatively little equipment (a net and a stop watch), so I do
agree that it is a good test… However, this has already been established for several fish species,
including Senegalese sole (e.g. Silva et al. 2010, which the authors refer to). I do agree that this is
the first time this has been done in both juveniles and adults “at the same time”, but that is as far
as their: “for the first time” statement (e.g. Ln 404, Ln 539), should be used. Generally speaking I
find that information is written in a very unorganized manner, while some details are given
straight away when they are needed, others are spread across the manuscript, which makes it
difficult to follow the general story (see below for details). One particularly important general
issue is the way the manuscript is written. That is, I believe that the authors would greatly benefit
from having an English native speaker go through the manuscript and correct it, just to give an
example (of many…) the use of “submitted” in Ln 46, when presumably what the authors mean
is “subjected”. I will not go into further detail regarding this, but this manuscript is not
acceptable as it is written right now.
Specific comments:
4
Ln 51: Fish do not have an adrenal gland, remove adrenal from hypothalamus-pituitary
interrenal. Alternatively explain that the HPI axis in fish is functionally homologous to the HPA
in mammals.
Ln 57-68: I find it interesting that the authors choose almost exclusively literature from wild fish
population studies when they are trying to make a point about coping styles being important in
aquaculture environments. While I do recognize the validity of the cited material regarding
coping styles in fish, there is now a copious amount of studies conducted on aquaculture species
that are related to coping styles (e.g. the review by Overli et al. 2007, the book chapter in Fish
Cognition by Ferno et al. 2011, etc).
Ln 95: the authors claim that they wish to confirm the existence of coping styles in sole. However,
there is already literature (cited in this manuscript) that has confirmed the existence of coping
styles in sole. I find very useful that the authors have compared results from several tests
conducted on the same individuals, that is a very good way to validate all these tests. This, I feel
should be given more importance and perhaps replace their first aim.
Ln 106: there is a lack of information regarding rearing history (light, temperature etc.) for all
fish. Where to the dish come from? Is this a particular aquaculture strain?
Ln 125: I understand that most likely there are logistical reasons for conducting tests on juveniles
in the summer and adults in autumn, but some sort of justification should be given for this.
All behavioural test (e.g. Ln 139-142): I find it hard to understand why the authors chose to
abbreviate all the behavioural parameters studied in all of their tests. I find this extremely
confusing, not least since they only explain once in their material and methods what each
abbreviation is (its not even an explanation in their table captions!!!!). I find this extremely
confusing and had to go back and forth several times while I was reading other sections of the
manuscript in order to try and figure out what was it that they were talking about. I realize that
for the authors this abbreviations maybe self explanatory, but the reader shouldn’t be required to
decipher these, they should be clear and easy to understand all throughout the text. I encourage
the authors to instead present their data in a manner similar to Castanheira et al. 2013 (which the
authors cite), who did a very similar comparison of several individual and group coping style
tests in Gilthead seabream (see for example their Table 1, which is pretty easy to understand by
itself, and compare to your Table 1).
Ln 143: the authors cite a zebrafish study claiming that their selected variables for the net
restraining test were adapted from this and 3 other studies. While the 3 other studies are very
relevant, the zebrafish study used restraining merely as a stressor (it included restraining over
several min repeatedly above and below the water and it was not used to assess coping style). It´s
hard to see the relevance of this study for the current work, besides the fact that they also used a
net to restrain fish, although in a different context and with a different motive.
Ln 176: the authors attempted to quantify the number of opercular movements as a proxy for
breathing rate, but later describe that it was difficult to assess. It´s hard to understand why they
chose to conduct live analysis of behavioral parameters instead of recordings (especially since
they mention video cameras for some of their other tests). Quantifying opercular movements
from video recordings could have simplified this practice.
Ln 179-184: why did the authors choose this test? Why did they think that this could be a proxy
for coping style? I am not claiming that it isn’t (even though they later report that its not), but I
am curious where they got the concept from, since they reference all pervious tests, while they
don’t give any justification for this one…
Ln 186-194: Again, one wonders, why this test? What was this based upon? Wouldn’t anaesthesia
inducement have more to do with body weight than actual coping style?
5
Ln 193-194: the MS222 should have been buffered in order to decrease pH problems (pH in
buffered MS222 solutions is kept around 7) that could potentially create confounding factors in
regards to cortisol, lactate and glucose measurements.
Ln 197-208: ecologically speaking the point of the novel object test is to evaluate risk-taking
behaviour from a foraging context. The individuals have to balance fear/foraging/exploring
since there is a risk of the object being dangerous (e.g. an unknown predator), but it may also be a
potential food source. So, why then make it so that the fish has to swim through the object? In
several other studies it is mainly measured the proximity of the individuals to the object. Why the
change in methodology here in such a well established test? Could this be why they didn’t obtain
any conclusive results? Why is the object different for juveniles and adults? There is no
justification for the change and one wonders…
Ln 224: previously in the manuscript the authors talk about a PIT tag (Ln 113), but do not explain
what PIT stands for… this should be done the first time they introduce the abbreviation in Ln 113
and not only in Ln 224 as they have currently done.
Ln 227-232: I do not understand what the authors mean by the cameras being used in order to
corroborate the information obtained by the antennas that read the PIT tags… I mean, the video
could not determine which fish had gone through or not, but do they mean corroborating that
indeed a fish had gone through? There is a need here for clarification!!
All individual tests: why were all tests conducted simultaneously one after another? In other
studies it is common practice to let fish rest for a period (usually several days, see for example
Castanehira 2013) to make sure that each test is started from basal conditions and that there is not
a cumulative stress effect that could confound results. I could be persuaded into accepting this
methodology, but as of now the authors do not explain why they chose this protocol. Could it not
be possible that the correlations found between the tests are the result of a cumulative effect of
stress from being subjected to so many tests at the same time? So if the fish was already active
then it remains active, not necessarily because it would normally do that in that specific situation,
but because its been already affected by the previous test(s)? This possibility argues against what
authors propose in Ln 475-476.
Ln 243-255: 2 blood samples, at basal and stress conditions, were taken for juveniles… However,
only one, after stress, was taken for adults. Why only one for adults? You are losing a possibly
important time point of comparison between juveniles and adults, besides being an inconsistency
in the methodology.
Now, if the authors had taken a blood sample after each individual test and had some days in
between each test for fish to recover or had taken the one blood sample after the one test (not a
whole series of tests), then its possible that they would have obtained a better correlation between
cortisol and the behavioural output(s). As it is, the authors try to correlate a series of behaviours
to the one point which happened after all 5 consecutive tests were taken. It may not be that
surprising that there was not a clear correlation between behaviour and cortisol, lactate and or
glucose (as they describe in Ln 435-436).
Statistical analysis: was there any compensation for the fact that the authors conduct several
Pearson correlation analyses (i.e. alpha correction)?
Ln 307-312: the authors consider that the new environment and the confinement test are testing
the same variable: exploratory activity. I disagree, while novel environment, just like the novel
object test is based on the ecological premise of foraging vs. fear (explore a new area for possible
food sources but exposing yourself to danger/possible predators), a confinement test is a
commonly used acute stress test, just like the restraining (net) test. During confinement, the
6
individuals do not have much of a chance to explore, since they are confined to a very small area,
in fact they are struggling to come out, just like during the restraining test. There is plenty of
literature on the use of confinement as an acute stressor, including some cited by the authors (Ln
173).
Ln 346: it seams strange that they do not have basal levels for adults
Ln 411: change “escape attempts and were active” to “were actively attempting to escape” they
are not 2 different things…
Ln 427-428: again, the fish in confinement are stressed and trying to escape this situation (see
ample literature on this), the fact that proactive fish are moving does not mean that they are
exploring and have adapted quickly to this environment like the authors are suggesting.
However, I agree with their suggestion concerning the activity of proactive fish in a new
environment, BUT this is NOT the same as in confinement, you are mixing pears with apples!
Ln 456-457: its hard to understand what they mean here… confusing sentence, please clarify
Ln 462: you are only talking about fish here, it is unnecessary to write HPA, see previous
comment for Ln51.
Ln 484-486: once more the confinement test (i.e. stress test) should be part of the fearfulness-
reactivity behaviour (its an aversive situation) instead of the activity-exploration behaviour
Ln 497-499: This statement is written in a poor manner. Consider revising so that your idea comes
across less like some sort of guess work. The idea behind this statement may be valid, but it is not
correctly written (e.g. using “supposed to cover…”).
Ln 507: even though it can be argued that you could really improve their behaviour, I think what
the authors mean here is that understanding coping styles may minimize stress responses, but it
is unclear what they actually mean, please rectify or clarify.
Ln 515-518: once again the authors choose several articles dealing with wild populations when
they are talking about implications in aquaculture… In fact this is pretty much a copy-paste
sentence from the introduction. Please update your references here!
Discrepancy (Ln 438-440 vs. Ln 529-530): while proactive are said to have lower post-stress
cortisol levels in Ln 438-440 compared to reactive, the opposite is written later in Ln 529-530.
Please fix!
Ln 534-535: I don’t really understand how knowing their coping style will help fish farmers
understand how efficiently fish feed… Coping style is not a direct measure of feed efficiency…
Figure 1: I question the usefulness of having this figure… It is a bit redundant and I don’t find it
that helpful. I believe that the manuscript does not benefit from having this figure.

Two reviewers have read and commented on your manuscript, and their reports should be
included. Based on their recommendations and my own reading of the manuscript, I'm not
convinced that the current manuscript is suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
If you decided to revise it, I'd think carefully about whether this journal is the correct venue,
given that your target audience may be more likely to read it in one of the more applied
aquaculture journals.
Reviewer #1 raises concerns about how you have handled 'no response' data within your
analyses. I agree that the binomial distributions you show in the graphs are confusing, given that
(as far as I can tell) you treat the latencies as a binary 'yes'/'no' variable in the tests. Did you
consider how the Pearson test you conducted between latencies was affected by the non-response
values?
Reviewer #2 questions the assumptions behind many of the protocol elements, and suggests that
you need to justify your tests more. I agree with this very strongly. The guidelines for animal
behaviour papers submitted to Open Science not only require local ethical review complying
with national guidelines, but also compliance with the ASAB/ABS guidelines. I am not
8
convinced that your manuscript goes far enough to meet these criteria. You are conducting tests
that could be seen as having aversive effects on the welfare of individuals, and you give little or
no justification for conducting them. I suspect that the tests you have conducted follow handling
procedures used in the farming of these fish, but it isn't obvious from your text. You need to do
more work to make the ethics of your study absolutely transparent to the reader (maybe
following the ARRIVE guidelines too). It is also important for your intended audience that you
explain why you are explaining your methods, given that a large part of the introduction
discusses the fact that current published techniques are not particularly standardised or practical:
if you can put an obvious '3Rs' message for your techniques, your manuscript would be much
more useful.

Animals that do not response should be identified as "non-responsive" and be labeled as a
separate group. It only makes sense to analyse response times of the responsive animals (which

The work described in present manuscript investigates coping styles in Senegalese soles. The

be possible that the correlations found between the tests are the result of a cumulative effect of
stress from being subjected to so many tests at the same time? So if the fish was already active
then it remains active, not necessarily because it would normally do that in that specific situation,
but because its been already affected by the previous test(s)? This possibility argues against what
authors propose in Ln 475-476.
Ln 243-255: 2 blood samples, at basal and stress conditions, were taken for juveniles… However,
only one, after stress, was taken for adults. Why only one for adults? You are losing a possibly
important time point of comparison between juveniles and adults, besides being an inconsistency
in the methodology.
Now, if the authors had taken a blood sample after each individual test and had some days in
between each test for fish to recover or had taken the one blood sample after the one test (not a
whole series of tests), then its possible that they would have obtained a better correlation between
cortisol and the behavioural output(s). As it is, the authors try to correlate a series of behaviours
to the one point which happened after all 5 consecutive tests were taken. It may not be that
surprising that there was not a clear correlation between behaviour and cortisol, lactate and or
glucose (as they describe in Ln 435-436).
Statistical analysis: was there any compensation for the fact that the authors conduct several
Pearson correlation analyses (i.e. alpha correction)?
Ln 307-312: the authors consider that the new environment and the confinement test are testing
the same variable: exploratory activity. I disagree, while novel environment, just like the novel
object test is based on the ecological premise of foraging vs. fear (explore a new area for possible
food sources but exposing yourself to danger/possible predators), a confinement test is a
commonly used acute stress test, just like the restraining (net) test. During confinement, the
individuals do not have much of a chance to explore, since they are confined to a very small area,
in fact they are struggling to come out, just like during the restraining test. There is plenty of
literature on the use of confinement as an acute stressor, including some cited by the authors (Ln
173).
Ln 346: it seams strange that they do not have basal levels for adults
Ln 411: change “escape attempts and were active” to “were actively attempting to escape” they
are not 2 different things…
Ln 427-428: again, the fish in confinement are stressed and trying to escape this situation (see
ample literature on this), the fact that proactive fish are moving does not mean that they are
exploring and have adapted quickly to this environment like the authors are suggesting.
12
However, I agree with their suggestion concerning the activity of proactive fish in a new
environment, BUT this is NOT the same as in confinement, you are mixing pears with apples!
Ln 456-457: its hard to understand what they mean here… confusing sentence, please clarify
Ln 462: you are only talking about fish here, it is unnecessary to write HPA, see previous
comment for Ln51.
Ln 484-486: once more the confinement test (i.e. stress test) should be part of the fearfulness-
reactivity behaviour (its an aversive situation) instead of the activity-exploration behaviour
Ln 497-499: This statement is written in a poor manner. Consider revising so that your idea comes
across less like some sort of guess work. The idea behind this statement may be valid, but it is not
correctly written (e.g. using “supposed to cover…”).
Ln 507: even though it can be argued that you could really improve their behaviour, I think what
the authors mean here is that understanding coping styles may minimize stress responses, but it
is unclear what they actually mean, please rectify or clarify.
Ln 515-518: once again the authors choose several articles dealing with wild populations when
they are talking about implications in aquaculture… In fact this is pretty much a copy-paste
sentence from the introduction. Please update your references here!
Discrepancy (Ln 438-440 vs. Ln 529-530): while proactive are said to have lower post-stress
cortisol levels in Ln 438-440 compared to reactive, the opposite is written later in Ln 529-530.
Please fix!
Ln 534-535: I don’t really understand how knowing their coping style will help fish farmers
understand how efficiently fish feed… Coping style is not a direct measure of feed efficiency…
Figure 1: I question the usefulness of having this figure… It is a bit redundant and I don’t find it
that helpful. I believe that the manuscript does not benefit from having this figure.

I do not wish at all to suggest that the authors are trying to "misinform or mislead" the readers. I

In my opinion the authors have two experimental readouts per behavioural test:

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_7
After reviewing this manuscript for the second time I find that while most of my concerns were
addressed by the authors on the rebuttal, some were not incorporated into the current
manuscript. This information is important for the reader since it explains the motivation behind
some of the methods employed. In general, the discussion should be revised and rewritten in a
more concise manner, at this point there is a lot of unnecessary repetition throughout and this
will only confuse readers and will take focus away from the main points being raised by the
authors. Furthermore, the authors have misinterpreted the so called fearfulness-reactivity and
activity-exploration syndromes, as I have previously pointed out, which should be taken into
account when interpreting their results. Please see detailed comments below.
Specific comments:
1. Ln 35-38 (and throughout the manuscript concerning this topic): regarding the fearfulness-
reactivity and activity-exploration syndromes/axis (or personality traits), as I have mentioned
previously, the confinement test (i.e. stress test) should be part of the fearfulness-reactivity (since
it is an aversive situation) instead of the activity-exploration syndrome.
The author´s response to this comment was: In accordance to Budaev and Brown (2011) and
Conrad et al. (2011) the“activity-exploration behaviour” axis includes the quantification of
activity levels of fish submitted to different contexts or situations that compromises their
allostatic load, such as those induced by confinement test.
So regarding exploration Conrad et al (2011), writes (page 405): The exploration–avoidance axis
encompasses behaviours that involve individual willingness to investigate novel environments,
food items or objects. Typically, these behaviours are measured by an animal’s latency to explore
a novel space (e.g. open-field test), novel objects or consume a novel food (R´eale et al., 2007). To
be potentially distinct from boldness, exploration should be assessed in the absence of predators
or other fright stimuli (other than novelty per se). Regarding activity (page 406): To address the
activity axis specifically, the frequency or quantity of movement must be measured in a safe and
familiar environment. That is, activity/exploration during or after stress should not be included
when studying this outputs. In Budaev and Brown (2011), it is also pointed out that activity levels
are better quantified in a non-experimental context, such as the home aquaria (Chapter 7,
subsection 7.2.2, page 141), they also mention in Chapter 7, subsection 7.2.1.3, page 140, how
these examples of behavioral syndromes were discussed by Sih et al 2004 in “Behavioral
syndromes: an integrative overview”). Sih and colleagues in turn discuss in depth what a
syndrome is and what one could interpret from correlated suits of behavior, they mention that a
behavioral syndrome involving exploratory behavior, fearfulness, aggression and response to
environmental change is identified as the procative-reactive axis (page 249).
So, this means that the activity measured during confinement is in fact reactivity towards a
stressful situation (confinement is used as a stress test and is accompanied by increased cortisol
levels, which validates its use as a stressor), which is in turn the same as it is measured when
conducting the net restrain test, so that both these tests should be categorized within the same
axis/syndrome. In fact, I was unable to find within the provided literature or in any literature
obtained from my own search, any mention to the“activity-exploration behaviour” axis including
activity levels under different contexts or situations that compromises the individuals allostatic
load. In fact, I find that the contrary has been proposed within the literature, but even if that was
the case, doesn’t the net restrain test also compromise the individual´s allostatic load? Then how
come these 2 tests are categorized in different axis/ syndromes? I think the authors should
reconsider their interpretation of theses axis and correct their results/discussion accordingly.
Ln 40-41: While I understand that one should be concise within the abstract, this line provides no
real substance. It is extremely vague and the authors should provide some possible points, as
they do in their discusion.
15
Ln 127: It is important to point out that trying to breed for a specific behavioural trait will in fact
select for a suit of correlated traits (as has been thoroughly discussed in the current manuscript)
so authors should rewrite this statement.
Ln 167: change “as follow”, with “in the following manner”
Ln 185-187: In order to maintain a better flow of information, I suggest that authors move this
statement to Ln 178, before: For juveniles…
Ln 187: Suggested change: The group tests consisted of: i) novel object and ii) risk taking
Ln 234: since the opercular opening data was not properly/successfully quantified it should be
removed completely from the manuscript
Ln 237: the basis for choosing this test still needs to be clarified within the test.
Ln 244: since this is not commonly used as a proxy for characterising coping styles, a couple of
lines explaining the rationale of this test would provide the reader with better context.
Ln 271: change “realized” to “conducted”
Ln 284: it is unnecessary to again include the explanation for what a PIT tag is since it has already
been done in Ln 165-166
Ln 296: change “by” with “in”
Statistical analysis: a type 1 error may be obtained when conducting more than one test on the
same data set, as in this case with the correlation data (e.g. ConAct vs. NetActA and ConAct vs.
NetEscA), since, unless corrected for, the probability of false significance is increased with the
increasing amount of individual tests, such as instead of using a Tukeys posthoc test, one were to
conduct 4 individual t tests without correcting the alpha. In this case the correlations were very
strong and even with alpha corrections would remain significant, but authors should still treat
their data in a correct manner.
Ln 403-404: this is interesting since it invalidates this test as an accurate way to measure
individual differences. Notably, it was only conducted since one of the authors noticed that
maybe this could be a viable coping style test. I think its great that the authors tried this and that
they provide results here, but they should also include a small comment on the fact that it is
indeed not a good coping style test, since it is part of their results.
Ln 416-426: this is indeed an interesting result, in fact, a good part of the discussion is based on
this result. However, very little data is provided. I think the paper would benefit from having a
figure which depicts clearly the high and low quartiles against the cortisol levels so that the
reader can clearly see the values against one another. As it is now, there is easy way to find this
information within the manuscript, I even checked the attached data file, but no Ntiles-analysis
scores are included, so that it is not possible to divide the individuals into their high and low
quartiles and therefore see their actual cortisol values. I suggest that authors include both a figure
and the Ntiles-analysis scores in their supplementary data file.
Furthermore, in juveniles new environment and the control cortisol and in breeders total activity
in a new environment and the post-stress cortisol p values are effectively 0.05 and since the
authors specify that significance was established as p < 0.05 (Ln 357), this results are in fact not
significant!
16
Ln 584: “between which range all fish behaviours and temperaments”. I am unable to understand
what the authors are trying to say here, please clarify!
Ln 617: omit “rearing conditions”
Table 1 and Table 2: within the caption for the tables the authors should provide the whole
explanation for NewLat instead of just writing the abbreviation.
Table 5 and 6, Figures 1, 2 and 3: within the caption for the tables and figures all abbreviations
should be explained. Even though a very helpful list of abbreviations is provided at the start of
the manuscript, all tables and figures should be able to stand alone.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_11
After this third revision I am satisfied with the way the authors have both replied to my
comments and how they have incorporated changes into the manuscript, which I believe has
greatly improved since the first submitted version.
Presently I have 2 comments:
Regarding the interpretation of the PCA analysis and behavioural syndromes (Page L567-590). I
agree with the authors that it is indeed important to not ignore the statistical association between
the measured parameters. However, one does need to put into context these results into a
biological context. Now granted, the authors are attempting to do so by clustering the quantified
behaviours into 2 syndromes. However, I strongly disagree, in a general basis (since there may
indeed be exceptions as I propose further below), with the authors claim that a confinement test
cannot be as stressful as a netting test. The netting involving air exposure is indeed highly
stressful, but cortisol levels (about 30 min post-stress) from subjecting fish to this practice have
been reported to have a magnitude comparable to those obtained by confinement (for about 30
min). In fact, low and high responding fish (that have been characterised as proactive and
reactive, respectively) in terms of their post-stress cortisol response have been selected by way of
a confinement test (both fresh and salt water salmonids)!
Now with that said, considering the statistical analysis obtained in this study, one may wonder if
a bottom dwelling flat fish may indeed experience confinement in the same way as a pelagic fish.
In fact, it would be very interesting to measure cortisol levels directly after, 30 min, and at 1 hr
post-confinement in these individuals in order to have a more concrete measure of their stress
response during this situation. I therefore encourage the authors to include a small discussion
about this topic in this section in order to encourage further research on this topic and to
highlight the fact that one needs to take into account the species biology one works with, as they
have pointed out in other sections.
22
L479-484. Regarding the opercular movement data, even though the authors still claim that this
was successfully quantified, I am afraid that the way they have written this in the discussion may
give the reader the wrong impression. I suggest that authors include in their discussion the very
interesting point which they included in the response to my comment:
“It should also be pointed out that sole in a threatening situation will stop breathing presumably
to avoid detection when buried in substrate. These kinds of observations perhaps also help
understand why the test may not be appropriate to determine stress coping styles of sole.” This is
indeed an intriguing point that may give further justification to the obtained results and it’s a
shame that it has not previously been included in the manuscript.

After this third revision I am satisfied with the way the authors have both replied to my
comments and how they have incorporated changes into the manuscript, which I believe has
greatly improved since the first submitted version.
Presently I have 2 comments:
Regarding the interpretation of the PCA analysis and behavioural syndromes (Page L567-590). I
agree with the authors that it is indeed important to not ignore the statistical association between
the measured parameters. However, one does need to put into context these results into a
biological context. Now granted, the authors are attempting to do so by clustering the quantified
behaviours into 2 syndromes. However, I strongly disagree, in a general basis (since there may
indeed be exceptions as I propose further below), with the authors claim that a confinement test
cannot be as stressful as a netting test. The netting involving air exposure is indeed highly
25
stressful, but cortisol levels (about 30 min post-stress) from subjecting fish to this practice have
been reported to have a magnitude comparable to those obtained by confinement (for about 30
min). In fact, low and high responding fish (that have been characterised as proactive and
reactive, respectively) in terms of their post-stress cortisol response have been selected by way of
a confinement test (both fresh and salt water salmonids)!
Now with that said, considering the statistical analysis obtained in this study, one may wonder if
a bottom dwelling flat fish may indeed experience confinement in the same way as a pelagic fish.
In fact, it would be very interesting to measure cortisol levels directly after, 30 min, and at 1 hr
post-confinement in these individuals in order to have a more concrete measure of their stress
response during this situation. I therefore encourage the authors to include a small discussion
about this topic in this section in order to encourage further research on this topic and to
highlight the fact that one needs to take into account the species biology one works with, as they
have pointed out in other sections.
L479-484. Regarding the opercular movement data, even though the authors still claim that this
was successfully quantified, I am afraid that the way they have written this in the discussion may
give the reader the wrong impression. I suggest that authors include in their discussion the very
interesting point which they included in the response to my comment:
“It should also be pointed out that sole in a threatening situation will stop breathing presumably
to avoid detection when buried in substrate. These kinds of observations perhaps also help
understand why the test may not be appropriate to determine stress coping styles of sole.” This is
indeed an intriguing point that may give further justification to the obtained results and it’s a
shame that it has not previously been included in the manuscript.

senegalensis) juveniles and breeders for aquaculture

Date Sent: May 2016
The authors appreciate the time spent and suggestions made by the editor and both reviewers
n this manuscript. We consider that the comments have helped to significantly improve the
manuscript. We have addressed all issues indicated in the review report and the manuscript
as been revised and rewritten considering the following major changes. We believe that the
evised version could meet the journal publication requirements. Please find attached the
evised version of the manuscript and below a detailed answer to the reviewers’ comments
Associate Editor Comments to Authors
Reviewer #1 raises concerns about how you have handled 'no response' data within your
nalyses. I agree that the binomial distributions you show in the graphs are confusing, given
hat (as far as I can tell) you treat the latencies as a binary 'yes'/'no' variable in the tests. Did
ou consider how the Pearson test you conducted between latencies was affected by the non-
esponse values?
Response: This comment was answered in the response to reviewer 1#, comment 1
Reviewer #2 questions the assumptions behind many of the protocol elements, and suggests
hat you need to justify your tests more. I agree with this very strongly. The guidelines for
nimal behaviour papers submitted to Open Science not only require local ethical review
omplying with national guidelines, but also compliance with the ASAB/ABS guidelines. I
m not convinced that your manuscript goes far enough to meet these criteria. You are
onducting tests that could be seen as having aversive effects on the welfare of individuals,
nd you give little or no justification for conducting them. I suspect that the tests you have
onducted follow handling procedures used in the farming of these fish, but it isn't obvious
rom your text. You need to do more work to make the ethics of your study absolutely
ransparent to the reader (maybe following the ARRIVE guidelines too). It is also important
or your intended audience that you explain why you are explaining your methods, given that
large part of the introduction discusses the fact that current published techniques are not
articularly standardised or practical: if you can put an obvious '3Rs' message for your
echniques, your manuscript would be much more useful.
Response: We have expanded the ethics statement to include the points raised by the editor.
This makes the statement rather long, we can reduce the statement if required.
Reviewer #1 Comments to Author:
Comment 1. In 3 out of 5 individual coping style tests, animals that do not show a response
"no movement" in the new environment and confinement tests, or "no recovery" in the
lipping over test) are awarded a 300 or 180 s response time. This is arbitrary and subjective.
Also, this treatment of non-responsive animals is in contrast with the "group risk taking test"
where animals that do not cross from a safe to a risky zone are classified as "proactive" or
reactive", respectively. Awarding non-existent response times of 300 and 180 s disturbs the
tatistical analysis. The skewed frequency distributions in Fig. 4 are arteficial and in fact not
imodal but heavily skewed. Animals that do not response should be identified as "non-
esponsive" and be labelled as a separate group. It only makes sense to analyse response
imes of the responsive animals (which statement is almost a tautology).
Response: In respect to these observations we have modified the text to give clarity on how
we collected and treated the data. We have also stated clearly that this is not the only way the
ata can be collected and treated and we have also offered some justification and discussion
n the subject based on the following observations and considerations:
irstly, we would like to say this is a concern that we have also considered amongst the
uthors and in discussion with other scientists working with behaviour. It was never our
ntention to misinform or mislead readers and we hope we have clarified the situation and
ow the data was collected and treated. The reviewer is correct the bimodality is created by
he way the data was registered / collected. The data is presented as continuous data not
inomial data. However, neither he / she or us can be sure of the true distribution, which may
e highly positively skewed (a large proportion of the population is in the second mode) or
imodal. It can be said to be arbitrary and subjective (as the referee says), but we have
esigned the test this way. It can also be said to be arbitrary and subjective to assign the
rganisms as proactive or reactive (as I think the referee suggests) before any analysis of the
ata has been made and before the test has been evaluated and accepted by the scientific
ommunity (as is the case with the risk test). There are arguments and positives and negatives
or both approaches and it is difficult to say one approach is correct and one is wrong. At
east we would not do this. We have used the continuous data presentation as it fulfils the
ims of the study and allows the analysis to determine the stress coping style of the organisms
ather than us arbitrarily assigning a behavioural style.
Therefore, here in this personality test we are using latency time as a censored variable and
ll censored variables are skewed in one or another direction. In this experiment we choose
he times from personal experience (preliminary studies) and also regarding previous studies
or the same species (Farwell and MacLaughlin 2009) and other species with the same type
f behavioural tests for personalities (Budaev 1997 on the statistical analysis of behavioural
atency measures, censored and non-censored variables, and on Budaev 1997 with an
xample on guppies personality tests). Risk taking in groups is a well stablished screening
rotocol that has been validated in several other studies for the same species (Millot et al.,
009; Raoult et al., 2012; Ferrari et al., 2015). We can’t just ‘not use’ irresponsive animals
s they are defined as reactive for this screening test. However, considering the concern of
he reviewer about the analysis, all data was reanalysed with another principal component
nalysis but this time we considered the latency times of fish in the new environment and in
onfinement as binary response (“yes” and “no”) and not quantitative or continuous. We also
erformed a logistic regression analysis to evaluate the correlation between the latencies in
ew environment and in confinement and the risk taking test (all redefined as binary). The
CA analysis showed similar results to those presented in the actual manuscript (see table
nd figures below the references). Further, the logistic regression analyses showed that the
atency time in new environment was not significantly correlated with the latency time in
onfinement and risk taking test in breeders (Wald-X2 = 2.87, df = 1, P = 0.090 and Wald-X2
1.91, df = 1, P = 0.167, respectively) and neither in juveniles (Wald-X2 = 2.18, df = 1, P =
.140 and Wald-X2 = 0.23, df = 1, P = 0.630, respectively), which is similar to the results
eported in the manuscript. Therefore, we consider that the analysis currently presented in
he manuscript is correctly and similar to other studies performed in fish species (reported
efore).
t seems in reference to the figures we think this is a misinterpretation from the reviewer as
ig 4 is the principal components analysis and Fig 1 is the frequency analysis. However to
void confusion we have eliminated Fig 1 from the manuscript following reviewer 1 further
ecommendation.
n reference to the point on “Did you consider how the Pearson test you conducted between
atencies was affected by the non-response values?” As mentioned above, yes we did, the
atencies were not correlated either as continuous time points or as binomial responses.
Comment 2. The tables fail to convey the message properly; I suggest to use boxplots and/or
catter plots to display all individual data points.
Response: Authors appreciate this suggestion. Nonetheless, presentation of data in plots
enerated too many graphs, which made the information too muddled and scattered. That’s
why we preferred to keep the tables in the manuscript, as we consider them as the best
lternative to sum up all the variables and responses of individuals along the different tests
erformed. However, we did some changes to make the tables 1 to 4 more understandable.
Comment 3. I am also confused by the tables. For instance: Table 1, line 1 reports a NetActW
net activity time in the water) of 14.8 ± 14.8 s (mean ± sd), and it is indicated that this is
ormally distributed. How is this possible? Under a normal distribution, 99.7% of the
bservations are within 3 standard deviations of the mean. This would mean that negative
NetActW times are measured?
Response: This was an unintentional error on the writing of the manuscript and it has been
orrected on the text of Table 1, Line 1
Comment 4. The authors aim at improving sole aquaculture by identifying favourable
henotypes for breeding. It is unfortunate that the authors do not provide data on the
eritability of the observed coping styles. This could easily have been by first studying
reeders, and then their offspring: a simple reversal of the experimental organisation.
Response: Authors appreciate this interesting idea of comparing coping styles of breeders
nd their offspring and they wish they had the opportunity to test heritability of the observed
oping styles. However, in real practice, very few viable larvae were obtained from breeders’
pawning, insufficient to obtain enough juveniles from this broodstock to be tested for their
ehaviour. Moreover the time to obtain juveniles older enough to be tested for coping styles
id not match with the period of the project. That’s why authors decided to test breeders and
uveniles originating from distinct families but reared in similar facilities and conditions.
However, the original aim of the present paper was to establish some reliable and helpful
tress coping styles tests for Senegalese sole breeders and juveniles to be used for industrial
ulture.
Reviewer #2 Comments to the Author(s)
Comment 1: Regarding their main conclusions, I do not agree with the implied novelty of
heir results. The authors found that the tests that gave the best results in their experiment
were the ones that in fact have been used the most in the same and other fish species (they
ven include some of these studies in their references), the authors only confirmed their
sefulness.
Response: Several of the tests performed in this study have actually been reported in many
ishes to identify their stress coping styles behaviours, and particularly in Senegalese sole
reeders. The originality of our work lies in testing a wide range of coping style tests
ommonly used in fish farms and cited in the literature to determine reactive/proactive
ehaviours in order to select the most reliable and operational for fish farmers of Senegalese
ole species (and possibly being used as an operational screening test for routine husbandry
se). We aimed to demonstrate that performing only the three selected tests it provides proper
nd sufficient information to characterize reactive/proactive behaviours in both Senegalese
ole breeders and juveniles without performing all tests previously used in fish farms and
ited in literature, which represent a significant gain of time and effort. Moreover, we validate
he efficiency of the selected test in the Senegalese sole at two different life stages (juveniles
nd breeders).
Comment 2. A) In addition, they claim that these are good, efficient tools for the aquaculture
ndustry, but a confinement and a new environment test are time consuming and not that
uitable for screening hundreds of individuals in a short time. Meanwhile, the restraining test
s less time consuming and requires relatively little equipment (a net and a stop watch), so I
o agree that it is a good test… However, this has already been established for several fish
pecies, including Senegalese sole (e.g. Silva et al. 2010, which the authors refer to). B) I do
gree that this is the first time this has been done in both juveniles and adults “at the same
ime”, but that is as far as their: “for the first time” statement (e.g. Ln 404, Ln 539), should
e used.
Response to A: In comparison to other coping style tests, such the risk taking test which is
ne of the most recognized screening tests to identify proactive and reactive traits but requires
ours to be achieved, we demonstrated that the three selected tests are suitable and faster for
enegalese sole industrial production. Moreover, many individuals can be tested in the
estraining, new environment and confinement tests in a relative short amount of time, since
he tests lasted only 5 and 1:30 min per fish, meaning that it is possible to test over a hundred
ish per day and per person. Further, these tests can be applied by non-experienced people or
ay people. Another advantage of this selected tests is that the portability of the equipment
makes them ideally suited for testing fish on the field.
Response to B: Authors understood that the statement “for the first time” may be not strictly
orrect and eliminated it from the text, as suggested by reviewer 1. However, this would be
he first paper published on stress coping style in Senegalese sole breeders. It is also the first
aper to apply a wide range of tests and select 3 simple tests that were demonstrated to cover
wo behavioural axis and have some consistency with physiological responses.
Comment 3. Generally speaking I find that information is written in a very unorganized
manner, while some details are given straight away when they are needed, others are spread
cross the manuscript, which makes it difficult to follow the general story (see below for
etails). One particularly important general issue is the way the manuscript is written. That
s, I believe that the authors would greatly benefit from having an English native speaker go
hrough the manuscript and correct it, just to give an example (of many…) the use of
submitted” in Ln 46, when presumably what the authors mean is “subjected”. I will not go
nto further detail regarding this, but this manuscript is not acceptable as it is written right
ow.
Response: The paper was extensively examined by a native English speaker who is the last
uthor of the manuscript. The specific comments on the grammatical and writing style have
een addressed individually.
Comment 4. Ln 51: Fish do not have an adrenal gland, remove adrenal from hypothalamus-
ituitary interrenal. Alternatively explain that the HPI axis in fish is functionally homologous
o the HPA in mammals.
Response: Authors appreciate reviewer´s comment and the text was corrected and re-written
s follow “Physiologically, proactive fishes are characterised by a lower hypothalamus-
ituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis activity compared to reactive fish, leading to lower post-stress
evels of glucocorticoids (i.e. cortisol) (2, 6). The neuroendocrine system that regulates the
iberation of glucocorticoids hormones in fish is functionally homologous to the
ypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) in mammals”. Line 81-85
Comment 5. Ln 57-68: I find it interesting that the authors choose almost exclusively
iterature from wild fish population studies when they are trying to make a point about coping
tyles being important in aquaculture environments. While I do recognize the validity of the
ited material regarding coping styles in fish, there is now a copious amount of studies
onducted on aquaculture species that are related to coping styles (e.g. the review by Overli
t al. 2007, the book chapter in Fish Cognition by Ferno et al. 2011, etc).
Response: The aim of the cited references were basically to show the main behavioural
ifferences between proactive and reactive responses in different fish species, kept in wild
r in captivity, and how these behavioural traits might influence the physiology of fishes.
However, considering the concern of the reviewer we re-wrote the paragraph as follows: “In
his sense, several studies have shown the significance of both behaviours in different fish
pecies in wild conditions or kept in captivity”. Line 92-94
Comment 6. Ln 95: the authors claim that they wish to confirm the existence of coping styles
n sole. However, there is already literature (cited in this manuscript) that has confirmed the
xistence of coping styles in sole. I find very useful that the authors have compared results
rom several tests conducted on the same individuals that is a very good way to validate all
hese tests. This, I feel should be given more importance and perhaps replace their first aim.
Response: We agree with the referee that stress coping styles have been demonstrated in
enegalese sole larvae and early juveniles (Martins et al., 2011; Ibarra-Zatarain et al., 2015),
ut no information is available on the existence of coping styles in pre-ongrowing juveniles
nd breeders of this fish species when this is a critical time period for reproduction purposes.
Therefore, it is important to demonstrate the presence of proactive and reactive behaviours
lso at this two life stages and to evaluate if the same tests than for larvae and early juveniles
re able to provide reliable information. Demonstrating the consistency and repeatability of
ndividual behaviours among tests and contexts will be the aim of a further publication.
Comment 7. Ln 106: there is a lack of information regarding rearing history (light,
emperature etc.) for all fish. Where to the dish come from? Is this a particular aquaculture
train?
Response: Rearing conditions are already exposed in the manuscript (“material & methods”
ection), however, we added information about juveniles and breeders origins on lines 156-
59: “Juveniles were obtained from a commercial aquaculture farm (Stolt Seafarm, Galicia,
pain), and were acclimatized into IRTA facilities during three months prior to tests, while
reeders were held in IRTA facilities for at least 5 years. During these periods prior to
xperiments all fish were held under natural photoperiod and temperature conditions”.
Comment 8. Ln 125: I understand that most likely there are logistical reasons for conducting
ests on juveniles in the summer and adults in autumn, but some sort of justification should
e given for this.
Response: This comment was taken into consideration and the sentence was re-written as
ollow “In order to not affect the reproductive cycle of Senegalese sole breeders, the
ndividual and group coping style tests were first performed in the juveniles and subsequently
n breeders”. Line 176-177
Comment 9. A) All behavioural test (e.g. Ln 139-142): I find it hard to understand why the
uthors chose to abbreviate all the behavioural parameters studied in all of their tests. I find
his extremely confusing, not least since they only explain once in their material and methods
what each abbreviation is (its not even an explanation in their table captions!!!!). I find this
xtremely confusing and had to go back and forth several times while I was reading other
ections of the manuscript in order to try and figure out what was it that they were talking
bout. I realize that for the authors this abbreviations maybe self-explanatory, but the reader
houldn’t be required to decipher these, they should be clear and easy to understand all
hroughout the text. B) I encourage the authors to instead present their data in a manner
imilar to Castanheira et al. 2013 (which the authors cite), who did a very similar comparison
f several individual and group coping style tests in Gilthead seabream (see for example their
Table 1, which is pretty easy to understand by itself, and compare to your Table 1).
Response A: We added an abbreviation section at the beginning of the manuscript to make
t clearer for the reader (Line 51-71). Further, we tried to significantly reduce the amount of
bbreviations through the text.
Response B: Tables were modified to be more understandable
Comment 10. Ln 143: the authors cite a zebrafish study claiming that their selected variables
or the net restraining test were adapted from this and 3 other studies. While the 3 other
tudies are very relevant, the zebrafish study used restraining merely as a stressor (it included
estraining over several min repeatedly above and below the water and it was not used to
ssess coping style). It´s hard to see the relevance of this study for the current work, besides
he fact that they also used a net to restrain fish, although in a different context and with a
ifferent motive.
Response: We eliminated the reference from the text, as suggested by reviewer #2.
Comment 11. Ln 176: the authors attempted to quantify the number of opercular movements
s a proxy for breathing rate, but later describe that it was difficult to assess. It´s hard to
nderstand why they chose to conduct live analysis of behavioral parameters instead of
ecordings (especially since they mention video cameras for some of their other tests).
Quantifying opercular movements from video recordings could have simplified this practice.
Response: The breathing rate test was not included in the initial experimental design, and
onsequently the use of videorecording equipment was not considered at this stage. However,
his parameter was selected just before starting tests, since we though it could be a reliable
ndicator of stress response in fish. Our observations were based on recommendations of
Barreto and Volpato (2011). Authors chose to expose these results on opercula movements,
ut we consider reviewer comment to record the behaviour next time in order to improve
esults in future coping styles tests.
Comment 12. Ln 179-184: why did the authors choose this test? Why did they think that
his could be a proxy for coping style? I am not claiming that it isn’t (even though they later
eport that its not), but I am curious where they got the concept from, since they reference
ll pervious tests, while they don’t give any justification for this one…
Response: This test was recommended by one of the authors, whom observed that some fish
lipped over, during a sampling procedure and returned to their normal position faster than
thers. It was also considered in mind of the pigs “back” test used to identify stress coping
tyles of piglets. Hence, we tried to correlate this parameter to coping styles as it was also
imilarly tested for Martins et al. (2011) with the handling test
Comment 13. Ln 186-194: Again, one wonders, why this test? What was this based upon?
Wouldn’t anaesthesia inducement have more to do with body weight than actual coping
tyle?
Response: This test was included as our experience has often associated certain fish with
ifficulties with anaesthesia during for example repeated blood sampling operations during
n experiment. Also, it was necessary to anesthetise the fish to obtain blood samples and,
herefore, offered the opportunity to make another test without any further stress to the
rganisms. Lastly, this test was also based on other references using similar methods based
n Welker et al. (2007) and Nordgreen et al. (2014). Line 254-255
Comment 14. Ln 193-194: the MS222 should have been buffered in order to decrease pH
roblems (pH in buffered MS222 solutions is kept around 7) that could potentially create
onfounding factors in regards to cortisol, lactate and glucose measurements.
Response: However, Welker et al. (2007) reported that buffered and unbuffered MS-222 did
ot lead to differences in cortisol, glucose or lactate levels in the channel catfish. Therefore,
we inferred that in the present study the anaesthetic might not interfere and disrupt the
roduction of glucocorticoids neither in juveniles nor in breeders, although this speculation
hould be verified for this species in further works. Anyway in salted water buffering is
sually unnecessary as the salt in the water already buffers the MS-222 solution.
Comment 15. Ln 197-208: ecologically speaking the point of the novel object test is to
valuate risk-taking behaviour from a foraging context. The individuals have to balance
ear/foraging/exploring since there is a risk of the object being dangerous (e.g. an unknown
redator), but it may also be a potential food source. So, why then make it so that the fish has
o swim through the object? In several other studies it is mainly measured the proximity of
he individuals to the object. Why the change in methodology here in such a well-established
est? Could this be why they didn’t obtain any conclusive results? Why is the object different
or juveniles and adults? There is no justification for the change and one wonders…
Response: Since Senegalese sole is a benthonic flatfish species, we had to adapt novel object
est usually performed for round fish. This led us to modify the test from the measurement of
ow close of the novel object fish are coming to “investigate” to the measurement of their
bility to cross into the novel object. The shape of the novel object was similar between
uveniles and breeders, but we adapted its size to fish size and tank dimensions.
Comment 16. Ln 224: previously in the manuscript the authors talk about a PIT tag (Ln 113),
ut do not explain what PIT stands for… this should be done the first time they introduce the
bbreviation in Ln 113 and not only in Ln 224 as they have currently done.
Response: This comment was taking into account and the explanation of what is a PIT tag
was added as suggested by the referee. Line 165-166
Comment 17. Ln 227-232: I do not understand what the authors mean by the cameras being
sed in order to corroborate the information obtained by the antennas that read the PIT tags…
mean, the video could not determine which fish had gone through or not, but do they mean
orroborating that indeed a fish had gone through? There is a need here for clarification!!
Response: The paragraph has been re-written as follow in order to clarify this point:
Additionally, two submersible black and white digital cameras (F60B/NIR580-50G model,
Korea Technology Co. Ltd, supplied by Praentesis S.L., Barcelona) connected to a recorder
DVR- 0404HB model, Dahua Technology Co. Ltd, supplied by Praentesis S.L., Barcelona)
were installed 10 cm below the water surface in both the safe and risky zone, to corroborate
hat the fish registered by the antenna had completely crossed from the safe to the risky area
nd not just approached the window”. Line 286-292
Comment 18. All individual tests: why were all tests conducted simultaneously one after
nother? In other studies it is common practice to let fish rest for a period (usually several
ays, see for example Castanehira 2013) to make sure that each test is started from basal
onditions and that there is not a cumulative stress effect that could confound results. I could
e persuaded into accepting this methodology, but as of now the authors do not explain why
hey chose this protocol. Could it not be possible that the correlations found between the tests
re the result of a cumulative effect of stress from being subjected to so many tests at the
ame time? So if the fish was already active then it remains active, not necessarily because it
would normally do that in that specific situation, but because its been already affected by the
revious test(s)? This possibility argues against what authors propose in Ln 475-476.
Response: The way the tests were performed were already validated from other screening
ests (Rey et al., 2013) in zebrafish that were consistent over time and different situations and
lso validated regarding differential gene expression. This reference has been added on the
ext at the material and methods section to explain why the use of the different tests on a
equential manner (Line 185-187). Animals don’t seem to have any cumulative stress
egarding the physiological parameters analysed. Also the tests were designed on a way that
mimic the normal handling farming procedures like transporting, grading animals or
accinating events that commonly happen under husbandry conditions and so they will be
more operative under normal farming procedures and no extra sampling stress should be
dded. Also the timing to compare the results from juveniles and adults was more adequate
y doing it like this. Lastly, many of the tests can be easily done together or would have to
e repeated (2-3 times) for each test and so it made sense to do the tests together to reduce
he number of times the fish were stressed. For example, the fish have to be netted (restraining
est) to pass the fish to the new environment. Therefore, we did the two tests together and
voided stressing the fish in the same way on two different occasions. The same for
naesthesia and bold sampling. We consider that all people working with behaviour should
im to work this way to avoid unnecessary stress of the organisms.
Comment 19. A) Ln 243-255: 2 blood samples, at basal and stress conditions, were taken
or juveniles… However, only one, after stress, was taken for adults. Why only one for
dults? You are losing a possibly important time point of comparison between juveniles and
dults, besides being an inconsistency in the methodology. B) Now, if the authors had taken
blood sample after each individual test and had some days in between each test for fish to
ecover or had taken the one blood sample after the one test (not a whole series of tests), then
t’s possible that they would have obtained a better correlation between cortisol and the
ehavioural output(s). As it is, the authors try to correlate a series of behaviours to the one
oint which happened after all 5 consecutive tests were taken. It may not be that surprising
hat there was not a clear correlation between behaviour and cortisol, lactate and or glucose
as they describe in Ln 435-436).
Response A: Juveniles and breeders were kept in separate tanks with different size and water
olume. In this context, juveniles could be quickly sampled to avoid the effect of stress of
ndividuals and the group on the basal levels. However, the breeder’s tanks made sampling
ifficult to be confident that true basal levels were obtained for all individuals. For this
ractical reason, the quantification of basal cortisol, glucose and lactate levels in breeders
was not considered. Further, Costas et al. (2011) suggested that glucocorticoids production
n Senegalese sole juveniles significantly increase after 20 min of exposure to stressful
ituation.
Response B: We agree with the reviewer when he/she comments that consecutive blood
amples may improve correlations with parameters of the stress coping styles tests. However,
his will not reach the objective of this study in selecting fast and reliable tests to determine
coping styles” in this fish species in commercial farms. Moreover, obtaining blood samples
f each organisms in consecutive sampling will surely affect fish health and welfare standards
Comment 20. Statistical analysis: was there any compensation for the fact that the authors
onduct several Pearson correlation analyses (i.e. alpha correction)?
Response: We don’t understand why compensation should be done as the Pearson
orrelations were done as different independent tests.
Comment 21. Ln 307-312: the authors consider that the new environment and the
onfinement test are testing the same variable: exploratory activity. I disagree, while novel
nvironment, just like the novel object test is based on the ecological premise of foraging vs.
ear (explore a new area for possible food sources but exposing yourself to danger/possible
redators), a confinement test is a commonly used acute stress test, just like the restraining
net) test. During confinement, the individuals do not have much of a chance to explore, since
hey are confined to a very small area, in fact they are struggling to come out, just like during
he restraining test. There is plenty of literature on the use of confinement as an acute stressor,
ncluding some cited by the authors (Ln 173).
Response: Authors considered this comment and to avoid any semantic confusion, the
entence has been re-written as follow: “In both the new environment and confinement tests,
ehavioural responses ranged from fish that that did not move and appeared to freeze on
eing introduced into the container to fish that immediately moved (low latency time) with a
igh level of activity during the 300s and consequentially the variation was high ranging
rom CV = 88.6%; (juvenile NewLat) to 167.2% (juvenile NewAct) (Table 1 and 2)”. Line
69-374
Comment 22. Ln 346: it seams strange that they do not have basal levels for adults
Response: Answered previously
Comment 23. Ln 411: change “escape attempts and were active” to “were actively
ttempting to escape” they are not 2 different things…
Response: This comment was taking into account and adequate modifications were done to
he manuscript. Line 479-480
Comment 24. Ln 427-428: again, the fish in confinement are stressed and trying to escape
his situation (see ample literature on this), the fact that proactive fish are moving does not
mean that they are exploring and have adapted quickly to this environment like the authors
re suggesting. However, I agree with their suggestion concerning the activity of proactive
ish in a new environment, BUT this is NOT the same as in confinement, you are mixing
ears with apples!
Response: Sentence was re-written as follow “These sole that did not move were recorded
s having a latency to first activity of 300 seconds. It should be understood that it was not
nown when these fish that did not move would have moved and that the bimodality may
ctually represent a highly positively skewed population (if fish moved at random points after
00 seconds) or a true bimodal situation (if the first movement of these fish was grouped
round a particular time point). This raises the question of the best way to treat the data, here
s in other publications (30) the fish that did not move were scored with a maximum time of
he test and the data was analyzed as continuous. An alternative would be to record a binomial
esponse i.e. fish that moved and fish that did not move. There are arguments and advantages
or and against the two approaches. Both approaches and analysis of the data from the present
tudy (binomial approach and analysis not included in this study) gave similar results and the
ame conclusions. The use of continuous data was preferred as it provided a more variable
esponse and a more robust analysis (more significance and variability) and enables the
nalysis to determine a stress coping style response rather than scoring organisms as
roactive (active in the tests) or reactive (inactive in the tests). Despite of these
onsiderations the bimodality appeared to represent the two extremes of personalities and
ossibly explained how fast proactive fish acclimate to a new environment or how fast they
eact to escape from confinement situation”. Line 495-512
Comment 25. Ln 456-457: its hard to understand what they mean here… confusing sentence,
lease clarify
Response: The sentence was corrected as suggested by reviewer: “In addition, the
ypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis of fish with high overall activity in the three
elected tests produced lower cortisol levels than HPI axis of fish with overall reduced
ctivity”. Line 540-542
Comment 26. Ln 462: you are only talking about fish here, it is unnecessary to write HPA,
ee previous comment for Ln51.
Response: Corrected as suggested.
Comment 27. Ln 484-486: once more the confinement test (i.e. stress test) should be part of
he fearfulness-reactivity behaviour (its an aversive situation) instead of the activity-
xploration behaviour
Response: In accordance to Budaev and Brown (2011) and Conrad et al. (2011) the “activity-
xploration behaviour” axis includes the quantification of activity levels of fish submitted to
ifferent contexts or situations that compromises their allostatic loas, such as those induced
y confinement test.
Comment 28. Ln 497-499: This statement is written in a poor manner. Consider revising so
hat your idea comes across less like some sort of guess work. The idea behind this statement
may be valid, but it is not correctly written (e.g. using “supposed to cover…”).
Response: This comment was considered to improve the quality of the manuscript and the
entence was re-written as follow: “In addition, the behavioural dimensions interpreted in the
resent work are two main behavioural traits documented in fish, between which range all
ish behaviours and temperaments (29, 40, 44, 46)”. Line 582-585
Comment 29. Ln 507: even though it can be argued that you could really improve their
ehaviour, I think what the authors mean here is that understanding coping styles may
minimize stress responses, but it is unclear what they actually mean, please rectify or clarify.
Response: The sentence was corrected following this comment: “In aquaculture, the
perational success of culturing fish depends, among other things, on providing optimal
earing conditions to improve fish welfare. Understanding fish coping styles may minimize
tress responses, resulting in increased survival, growth, resistance to diseases and,
ltimately, improved reproduction”. Line 592-595
Comment 30. Ln 515-518: once again the authors choose several articles dealing with wild
opulations when they are talking about implications in aquaculture… In fact this is pretty
much a copy-paste sentence from the introduction. Please update your references here!
Response: This comment was reconsidered and the sentence has been re-written as follow
The effect of external stimuli of the fish held in captivity (i.e. human presence, fish
manipulation, feeding, etc.) might result in different coping styles behavioural responses,
ince animals react differently to the same stimulus in function of their different personalities
r stress coping styles (19, 55-57)”. Line 598-601
Comment 31. Discrepancy (Ln 438-440 vs. Ln 529-530): while proactive are said to have
ower post-stress cortisol levels in Ln 438-440 compared to reactive, the opposite is written
ater in Ln 529-530. Please fix!
Response: Corrected as suggested. Line 613
Comment 32. Ln 534-535: I don’t really understand how knowing their coping style will
elp fish farmers understand how efficiently fish feed… Coping style is not a direct measure
f feed efficiency…
Response: Sentence was re-written as follow “Incorporating suitable and reliable tests to
earing protocols to characterize stress coping styles of Senegalese sole juveniles and
reeders under rearing conditions may generate valuable information to fish farmers in order
o detect, for example, how efficiently fish are able to adapt to their environment and captive
earing conditions and husbandry”. Line 615-619
Comment 33. Figure 1: I question the usefulness of having this figure… It is a bit redundant
nd I don’t find it that helpful. I believe that the manuscript does not benefit from having this
igure.
Response: We eliminate the figure as suggested by the referee.

Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comment 1:
do not wish at all to suggest that the authors are trying to "misinform or mislead" the readers.
only wish to state that awarding a response time of 180 or 300 s to non-responding animals
s subjective and distorting statistical analysis. Why not ward 600, or 3600 s to non-
esponding animals?
n my opinion the authors have two experimental readouts per behavioural test:
. The proportions of responding and non-responding animals, a categorical dependent
ariable.
. The response time of responding animals, a dependent variable of the ratio type.
Response: This question is discussed in depth between Line 474 to 496 in the discussion
ection of the manuscript and the rational for this time awarded is also justified. Perhaps the
election of 300 s does appear arbitrary, we consider that it is not, but why not another time
s the referee suggests? The 300 s time gave us a clear first mode with a decline to close to
ero more time was just making the test longer and less practical to execute. However, we
gree it is a difficult and controversial type of analysis as we discuss in the text. The best way
orward, in our view, is to publish clearly what we have done and see how it is received by
he scientific community. Time will tell if others use the test in the way we have or make
modifications as the reviewer suggests.
Reviewer: 2
After reviewing this manuscript for the second time I find that while most of my concerns
were addressed by the authors on the rebuttal, some were not incorporated into the current
manuscript. This information is important for the reader since it explains the motivation
ehind some of the methods employed. In general, the discussion should be revised and
ewritten in a more concise manner, at this point there is a lot of unnecessary repetition
hroughout and this will only confuse readers and will take focus away from the main points
eing raised by the authors. Furthermore, the authors have misinterpreted the so called
earfulness-reactivity and activity-exploration syndromes, as I have previously pointed out,
which should be taken into account when interpreting their results. Please see detailed
omments below.
Response: Although we do not entirely agree, we have re-read the discussion a few more
imes. We think perhaps part of the problem is that the same concepts are repeated for
ifferent reasons. We have, therefore, put in some headings to clearly indicate the subject
rea of each section to highlight differences when concepts are repeated. In doing this we
lso moved some text to group text under on the same subject area and this did highlight
ome repetition that was deleted. We think the discussion has been improved and hope the
eferee agrees.
Comment 1. Ln 35-38 (and throughout the manuscript concerning this topic): regarding the
earfulness-reactivity and activity-exploration syndromes/axis (or personality traits), as I
ave mentioned previously, the confinement test (i.e. stress test) should be part of the
earfulness-reactivity (since it is an aversive situation) instead of the activity-exploration
yndrome.
The author´s response to this comment was: In accordance to Budaev and Brown (2011) and
Conrad et al. (2011) the “activity-exploration behaviour” axis includes the quantification of
ctivity levels of fish submitted to different contexts or situations that compromises their
llostatic load, such as those induced by confinement test.
o regarding exploration Conrad et al (2011), writes (page 405): The exploration–avoidance
xis encompasses behaviours that involve individual willingness to investigate novel
nvironments, food items or objects. Typically, these behaviours are measured by an animal’s
atency to explore a novel space (e.g. open-field test), novel objects or consume a novel food
R´eale et al., 2007). To be potentially distinct from boldness, exploration should be assessed
n the absence of predators or other fright stimuli (other than novelty per se). Regarding
ctivity (page 406): To address the activity axis specifically, the frequency or quantity of
movement must be measured in a safe and familiar environment. That is, activity/exploration
uring or after stress should not be included when studying this outputs. In Budaev and
Brown (2011), it is also pointed out that activity levels are better quantified in a non-
xperimental context, such as the home aquaria (Chapter 7, subsection 7.2.2, page 141), they
lso mention in Chapter 7, subsection 7.2.1.3, page 140, how these examples of behavioral
yndromes were discussed by Sih et al 2004 in “Behavioral syndromes: an integrative
verview”). Sih and colleagues in turn discuss in depth what a syndrome is and what one
ould interpret from correlated suits of behavior, they mention that a behavioral syndrome
nvolving exploratory behavior, fearfulness, aggression and response to environmental
hange is identified as the procative-reactive axis (page 249).
So, this means that the activity measured during confinement is in fact reactivity towards a
tressful situation (confinement is used as a stress test and is accompanied by increased
ortisol levels, which validates its use as a stressor), which is in turn the same as it is measured
when conducting the net restrain test, so that both these tests should be categorized within
he same axis/syndrome. In fact, I was unable to find within the provided literature or in any
iterature obtained from my own search, any mention to the “activity-exploration behaviour”
xis including activity levels under different contexts or situations that compromises the
ndividuals allostatic load. In fact, I find that the contrary has been proposed within the
iterature, but even if that was the case, doesn’t the net restrain test also compromise the
ndividual´s allostatic load? Then how come these 2 tests are categorized in different axis/
yndromes? I think the authors should reconsider their interpretation of theses axis and
orrect their results/discussion accordingly.
Response: The description of the axis was based on the results obtained from the principal
omponents analysis (PCA) (Tables 5 and 6, juveniles and breeders, respectively). The PCA
esulted in two main components. The first component (PC1) associated the activity and
atency of Senegalese sole, juveniles and breeders, in the new environment and confinement
ests, while the second component (PC2) associated the activity of juveniles and breeders in
he restraining test and the cortisol production. This association between parameters of the
ests is clearly indicated by the high component matrix score (Tables 5 and 6). Therefore, the
ssociation made in the present manuscript was based on an impartial statistical test and not
n interpretations of a behavioural or personality aspect that the observer considered the test
was affecting of the animal. We do not think it is appropriate to ignore the statistical
ssociation and argue that actually this test should be associated with a different test. The
omponents (PC1 and PC2) needed to be interpreted. Therefore, we interpreted the PC1 as
he component that resembled activity and exploration, while the PC2 reflected the
earfulness-reactivity of both juveniles and breeders of Senegalese sole. In accordance to
Budaev (2010), page 472, variables loading on the same principal component (i.e., having
igh correlations or similarities with each other) share a signi<U+FB01>cant proportion of common
ariance and are thought to imply a common cause (e.g., behavioural mechanism). Therefore
ur intention was to suggest that those associated variables, from each component, denoted
kind of behavioural trait or dimension. But, we never pretended to associate variables from
ests that seems to induce similar stress situations, we only report the results and components
btained from the PCA. Then, we cannot associate the restraining with confinement test,
lthough they seem to represent fearfulness-reactivity, because the PCA showed us that
estraining was linked to cortisol levels, while confinement was linked to new environment
est. However, in order to clarify this issue we decided to rewrite the sentence as follow “The
nterpretations of components reflecting behavioural traits or syndromes, as in the present
tudy, have been previously described in others fish species, such as guppy (Poecilia
eticulata) (40), Nile tilapia (52), and brown trout (53), by means of similar tests and
tatistical analysis to those used in the present study to characterize fish stress coping styles.”
Line 575-579
Moreover, the activity-exploration behaviour is recognized to be part of personality
imensions or behavioural traits (Budaev, 1997, page 404, 407-409; Budaev 1998, page 18,
7; Budaev and Zworykin, 2002, page 191-193). Moreover, this behavioural dimension, as
was expressed in the manuscript, represents different behavioural tactics and responses to
vents or situations that compromises the normal behaviour of individuals.
Lastly, we would like to manifest that we do not believe that the restraining and confinement
ests induced similar stress levels in fish. On one hand, the restraining test generates high or
evere stressful situation in marine organisms, since being captured with a net is not a natural
nteraction (i.e., predation, competition, hierarchies, etc.) in the wild. Whilst the novel
nvironment and the confinement tests induced moderate stress levels, since fish were always
ept into the water and were able to spin. For that reason, in our study we considered that
onfinement test did not represent an aversive stress situation. This interpretation was similar
o those proposed by Meshalkina and Kalueff (2016) in mice.
Comment 2. Ln 40-41: While I understand that one should be concise within the abstract,
his line provides no real substance. It is extremely vague and the authors should provide
ome possible points, as they do in their discussion.
Response: We modified the text as follow “In addition, the three proposed tests met some
asic criteria (rapid testing, no special equipment and easy to apply and interpret) that could
esult attractive for fish farmers to identify fish with behaviour that give advantages in the
ulture system and that could be used to establish selection-based breeding programs to
mprove domestication and production.” Line 40-44
Comment 3. Ln 127: It is important to point out that trying to breed for a specific behavioural
rait will in fact select for a suit of correlated traits (as has been thoroughly discussed in the
urrent manuscript) so authors should rewrite this statement.
Response: Corrected the text as suggested. Line 121-124
Comment 4. Ln 167: change “as follow”, with “in the following manner”
Response: Corrected as suggested. Line 144
Comment 5. Ln 185-187: In order to maintain a better flow of information, I suggest that
uthors move this statement to Ln 178, before: For juveniles…
Response: Corrected as suggested. Line 153-154
Comment 6. Ln 187: Suggested change: The group tests consisted of: i) novel object and ii)
isk taking
Response: Corrected as suggested. Line 162
Comment 7. Ln 234: since the opercular opening data was not properly/successfully
uantified it should be removed completely from the manuscript
Response: We disagree that the test was not properly or successfully quantified. We would
ot present data that was not sound. We only wish to express that it required very close
oncentration and vigilance over a long period of time (many animals). We prefer to keep
he test in the manuscript to both highlight the draw backs we found (mainly low variance
nd poor correlations) but also to keep / put it on the table as a test that could be further
eveloped. It should also be pointed out that sole in a threatening situation will stop breathing
resumably to avoid detection when buried in substrate. These kinds of observations perhaps
lso help understand why the test may not be appropriate to determine stress coping styles of
ole.
Comment 8. Ln 237: the basis for choosing this test still needs to be clarified within the test.
Response: The text was rewritten as follow “The selection of this test was following
ecommendations of the authors whom observed that during a sampling procedure, which
nvolved flipping the fish, some fish recover or fought to recover the normal position faster
han others.” Line 215-217. It is also interesting to consider the similarities that the test has
with the “back” test that is an established procedure for determining the stress coping style
f piglets.
Comment 9. Ln 244: since this is not commonly used as a proxy for characterising coping
tyles, a couple of lines explaining the rationale of this test would provide the reader with
etter context.
Response: The sentence was written as follow: “This test was selected as authors observed
hat different sole reacted differently and apparently consistently in the anesthesia bath (i.e.
uring repeated monthly sampling certain sole were always more difficult to anesthetize than
ther sole) and on the base that anaesthesia induce differences in cortisol, which is a good
marker of stress coping styles (38) and was adapted from studies performed by Welker et al.
38) and Nordgreen et al. (39).” Line 227-232
Comment 10. Ln 271: change “realized” to “conducted”
Response: Corrected as suggested. Line 252
Comment 11. Ln 284: it is unnecessary to again include the explanation for what a PIT tag
s since it has already been done in Ln 165-166
Response: Corrected as suggested
Comment 12. Ln 296: change “by” with “in”
Response: Corrected as suggested. Line 276
Comment 13. Statistical analysis: a type 1 error may be obtained when conducting more
han one test on the same data set, as in this case with the correlation data (e.g. ConAct vs.
NetActA and ConAct vs. NetEscA), since, unless corrected for, the probability of false
ignificance is increased with the increasing amount of individual tests, such as instead of
sing a Tukeys posthoc test, one were to conduct 4 individual t tests without correcting the
lpha. In this case the correlations were very strong and even with alpha corrections would
emain significant, but authors should still treat their data in a correct manner.
Response: When various correlations were performed on the same data set, the procedure of
Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) was implemented, using the R Package (R Development
Core Team, https://www.r-project.org), to correct probabilities and control Type 1 error
Benjamini and Hochberg 1995; García, 2004). Line 335-338
Comment 14. Ln 403-404: this is interesting since it invalidates this test as an accurate way
o measure individual differences. Notably, it was only conducted since one of the authors
oticed that maybe this could be a viable coping style test. I think it´s great that the authors
ried this and that they provide results here, but they should also include a small comment on
he fact that it is indeed not a good coping style test, since it is part of their results.
Response: The sentence was corrected as follow: “Fish weight appeared to be an issue for
his test, since the heaviest fish showed more difficulties in flipping over than lighter fish,
herefore this test was not considered a reliable test to characterize stress coping styles in
enegalese sole.” Line 385-387
Comment 15. Ln 416-426: this is indeed an interesting result, in fact, a good part of the
iscussion is based on this result. However, very little data is provided. I think the paper
would benefit from having a figure which depicts clearly the high and low quartiles against
he cortisol levels so that the reader can clearly see the values against one another. As it is
ow, there is easy way to find this information within the manuscript, I even checked the
ttached data file, but no Ntiles-analysis scores are included, so that it is not possible to divide
he individuals into their high and low quartiles and therefore see their actual cortisol values.
suggest that authors include both a figure and the Ntiles-analysis scores in their
upplementary data file.
urthermore, in juveniles new environment and the control cortisol and in breeders total
ctivity in a new environment and the post-stress cortisol p values are effectively 0.05 and
ince the authors specify that significance was established as p < 0.05 (Ln 357), this results
re in fact not significant!
Response: We include the graphics in the main manuscript as was suggested by the reviewer
Figure 1 and 2).
Comment 16. Ln 584: “between which range all fish behaviours and temperaments”. I am
nable to understand what the authors are trying to say here, please clarify!
Response: We eliminate this statement from the text.
Comment 17. Ln 617: omit “rearing conditions”
Response: Corrected as suggested
Comment 18. Table 1 and Table 2: within the caption for the tables the authors should
rovide the whole explanation for NewLat instead of just writing the abbreviation.
Response: Corrected as suggested
Comment 19. Table 5 and 6, Figures 1, 2 and 3: within the caption for the tables and figures
ll abbreviations should be explained. Even though a very helpful list of abbreviations is
rovided at the start of the manuscript, all tables and figures should be able to stand alone.
Response: Corrected as suggested

We would like to take advantage of this document to express our sincere thanks to both
eviewers whom identified areas of our manuscript that needed improvement. We have
ddressed both comments made by the reviewer. We have also highlighted some very minor
hanges that were made during proof reading and in relation to new literature and
erminology that has be published in recent weeks.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
Comment 1: Presently I have 2 comments: Regarding the interpretation of the PCA analysis
nd behavioural syndromes (Page L567-590). I agree with the authors that it is indeed
mportant to not ignore the statistical association between the measured parameters.
However, one does need to put into context these results into a biological context. Now
ranted, the authors are attempting to do so by clustering the quantified behaviours into 2
yndromes. However, I strongly disagree, in a general basis (since there may indeed be
xceptions as I propose further below), with the authors claim that a confinement test cannot
e as stressful as a netting test. The netting involving air exposure is indeed highly stressful,
ut cortisol levels (about 30 min post-stress) from subjecting fish to this practice have been
eported to have a magnitude comparable to those obtained by confinement (for about 30
min). In fact, low and high responding fish (that have been characterised as proactive and
eactive, respectively) in terms of their post-stress cortisol response have been selected by
way of a confinement test (both fresh and salt water salmonids)!
Now with that said, considering the statistical analysis obtained in this study, one may
wonder if a bottom dwelling flat fish may indeed experience confinement in the same way
s a pelagic fish. In fact, it would be very interesting to measure cortisol levels directly after,
0 min, and at 1 hr post-confinement in these individuals in order to have a more concrete
measure of their stress response during this situation. I therefore encourage the authors to
nclude a small discussion about this topic in this section in order to encourage further
esearch on this topic and to highlight the fact that one needs to take into account the species
iology one works with, as they have pointed out in other sections.
Response: The discussion have been improved and re-written as follows: “It is worth noting
hat the PCA analysis represented a practical statistical method to reduce variables and
haracterized coping styles of Senegalese sole juveniles and breeders. The three selected tests
resented the highest weight in the first two components (PC1 and PC2) of the PCA and
xplained the highest variance. Studies using PCA to characterize animal behaviour have
een performed not only in fish (28, 48, 49) but also in other vertebrates such as birds (50)
nd mammals (51). In relation to the two main extracted PCA components, it seemed that
C1 represented the fish “activity-exploration behaviour” due to the high PCA context
orrelations observed between, new environment activity – latency and confinement activity
latency while PC2 characterised Senegalese sole “fearfulness-reactivity behaviour”
ecause of the high PCA context correlations between activity in the restraining test in air
nd cortisol concentrations (control and post-stress) for juveniles and between activity in the
estraining test in water and cortisol concentrations (post-stress) for breeders. The “activity-
xploration behaviour” was defined by the high activity and explorative behaviour showed
y juveniles and breeders when submitted to new environments or into a confinement
ituation, which closely resembles curiosity, impulsiveness or reactiveness to the presence-
bsence of conspecifics, space and sociability. The “fearfulness-reactivity behaviour” was
nterpreted as the reaction of fish in relation to an aversive situation that resembles fear,
timulation and anxiety. The interpretation of components reflecting behavioural traits or
yndromes, as in the present study, have been previously described in others fish species,
uch as guppy (Poecilia reticulata) (39), Nile tilapia (52), and brown trout (53), by means of
imilar tests and statistical analysis to those used in the present study to characterize fish
tress coping styles.
However, although similar behavioural axes were found across different fish species,
ifferent behavioural tests have been plotted in the PCA to represent the behavioural axes. In
articular the confinement test has been both included in “activity-exploration behaviour”
xis in correlation with the new environment test (present study; 39) and in “fearfulness-
eactivity behaviour” axis in correlation with the restraining test (54). This difference may
e due to methodological differences in executing the confinement test or intrinsic biological
ifferences between species. The confinement assay has been considered as a fearful test
ince it induces differences in cortisol, a factor that is strongly linked to behaviours indicating
earfulness (30). However, the duration in confinement was considerably higher in studies
hat utilized confinement to discriminate for stress coping styles (30 minutes at least, 17, 32,
3, 55) compared to the present study (5 minutes). Moreover, these studies (17, 25, 30, 32,
3, 54, 55) were performed on round fishes, whereas in a flatfish species such as Senegalese
ole, the perception of this test was probably different. Placing a fish in confinement where
wimming is difficult or not possible would have different effects on a round fish that is
onstantly swimming compared to a flatfish that leads a largely stationary life on the bottom
nd differences in the species reaction to confinement would be expected and could be tested
y looking at cortisol and other stress indicators. Therefore, methodological and biological
ifferences identified between previous studies and the present study with sole may explain
why the confinement test was correlated with the new environment test in the PC1 and not
with the restraining test. Nonetheless, it would be interesting to perform further studies
ombining these three tests on other round fish and flatfish species, in order i) to confirm the
ssociations obtained in each of the generated components, ii) to examine stress response to
he tests and iii) to get more solid basis for the establishment of the axis of personality
roposed”. Line 561-606
Comment 2: L479-484. Regarding the opercular movement data, even though the authors
till claim that this was successfully quantified, I am afraid that the way they have written
his in the discussion may give the reader the wrong impression. I suggest that authors include
n their discussion the very interesting point which they included in the response to my
omment: “It should also be pointed out that sole in a threatening situation will stop breathing
resumably to avoid detection when buried in substrate. These kinds of observations perhaps
lso help understand why the test may not be appropriate to determine stress coping styles of
ole.” This is indeed an intriguing point that may give further justification to the obtained
esults and it’s a shame that it has not previously been included in the manuscript.
Response: The sentence have been re-written as follow: “. The principal reason to reject these
ests was low variance across the population and lower correlations with other tests. Low
ariance in opercula movements for Senegalese sole could be related to the observation that
ommon sole (Solea solea), a closely related species, reduce ventilation rates when startled
42). Therefore, in a similar way, Senegalese sole in the present study may have reduced
entilation rates in the tests and thus reduced variance between behavioural phenotypes. In
ddition, there were some technical issues such as observing slight opercula movements and
n the flip over test, results appeared to be compromised by fish size, particularly for breeders.
These considerations indicate that opercula movements, anaesthesia and the flip over test
may not be appropriate to determine the stress coping style of sole”. Line 471-480
