In this study, gentoo penguins were equipped with cameras to document predator-prey
dynamics. The supplemental videos examples were well done and very useful in showing
different penguin behaviors, prey capture and prey distributional characteristics. This study is
unique in that it reveals gentoo penguins avoided foraging on aggregations of lobster krill and
the ability of lobster krill to avoid predation by using their claws to pinch the penguin. Anther
interesting finding was that penguin only pursued higher energy prey items (larger fish/squid)
when missed. The behavior of the predator and prey in this sense is novel but in general, the
importance of this behavior to gentoo penguins throughout their entire range is limited because
gentoo penguins at other locations do not feed on lobster krill or other species with a defense
mechanism. Therefore, the text needs to be altered to include these points. In addition, it seems
like the most logical explanation for why penguins are not foraging on aggregations is due to
communal defense (not confusion effect) as there are many examples in the literature of penguins
foraging on aggregating species. Another aspect the authors have not included is that the gentoo
penguin is known to be flexible in their diet, behavior, and other life history strategies. This
provides another example of their flexible diet, foraging strategies based on available food, and
ability to forage alone (vs. other studies that show the importance of group foraging).
Major Comments
The results are much overstated. The majority of prey items ingested by gentoo penguins have no
defense system to ward off predation. One of the conclusions of the study is that we cannot relate
predator diet to prey availability/abundance due to prey behavior. There are many examples in
the literature where you can in fact relate penguin diet to prey availability, which is ignored here.
Including text on gentoo penguin’s main prey species at other locations would be useful. It would
also be useful to give examples of other prey items with defense systems that penguins forage on.
Given this, only at some locations prey defense mechanisms need to be considered.
More information is need in the tagging section (see more specific comments below). It should
also be noted in the discussion that the effects of foraging location couldn’t be accounted for
because tags did not have GPS. This is important because an individual may have a preferred
foraging location where prey items are present in different abundances.
Specific Comments
L25. Explain what is novel here. Ex. “develop a novel biologging approach” to quantify prey
characteristics from “animal-borne camera loggers”
L33. Not all prey have the ability to avoid capture or defend themselves. This last sentence is a bit
of an overstatement. This only needs to be considered when prey have aggressive behavior
defense mechanisms that can harm the predator.
L41 distribution? What is meant here?
3
L44. Reword “Multiple factors, both intrinsic,” to “intrinsic factors,”
L48. There are quite a few animal-borne camera logger studies in the literature. I suggest citing a
few here or adding a sentence on how your study is different.
L51. delete “other point of view”
L55. I cannot find Figure S1.
L53. Adult penguins? Male or female? How was a penguin chosen for tagging? Did the tagged
penguins have chicks? How were birds recaptured …luck of finding them again or you waited
for the bird to return? How long is a typical foraging trip? How was the camera attached to the
bird (tape, zipties, etc.)?
Were the cameras triggered on by seawater or they recorded from the time of tagging.
L58. Is it necessary to say “freeware approach”, instead of just approach or freeware?
L61. How were light intensity levels determined?
L62. “Prey size was estimated by comparing it to penguin bill size.” How did you account for the
prey being an unknown distance from the penguin’s bill?
L59. Rephrase. “This involved converting video formats from X to X and then manual annotation
of each clip?
L62. What does quantifying annotated video files mean?
L66 The fixed effect was density?
Is ImageJ a common technique used to determine zooplankton density from photographs?
Was there an effect of distance from swarm and percent coverage? The closer the bird is to the
swarm the easier it is to see gaps between individuals whereas if the bird is far from the swarm it
looks like a large blob with no gaps. Water clarity might impact this as well.
L69-70. This wording makes it sound like ImageJ was performed in R but here you are talking
about GLMM, correct?
For GLMM, need to mention what the random effect was? Why were models with and without
fixed effects compared?
L75. What happened to the footage from the other 7 birds? Only 31 out of 38 went foraging?
L92-93. Rephrase to emphasize small sample size here. “This contrasted with larger squid and
fish, where it was clear that birds pursued prey but these prey items were rarely ingested (n=8).
L95 Capitalize “Table” and “Figure” throughout.
L97. Can the authors add how many individuals are represented in the “64 separate events”?
Figure 2- caption and figure label should use same language for clarity. X-axis is percent cover
4
not swarm density? Add explanation of Frequency in caption. Why is the frequency axis 0-30 and
30-0?
L105 Rephrase to “Using percent coverage as a proxy for swarm density”
L109. BR? CB?
L113 Replace “multi” with “two”
L114-15 This is only a problem when predators consume prey with active defenses. Many small
aggregating prey species eaten by penguins have no ability to defend themselves.
L121 Replace “is” with “in”
L123-25. I would argue that communal defense of prey on predators would be the major factor
leading to penguins feeding on the periphery. There are examples in the literature of penguins
swimming through swarms of krill, which have no defense system. There are other examples in
the literature of penguins working in groups to foraging on schools of fish. There is much
support for penguin foraging on schools and thus, the benefits of foraging on schooling species.
The main difference between krill/fish and lobster krill is that the lobster krill can actually pinch
their predators. It seems like any smart penguins is not going to want to swim through a school
of pinchers.
Was a bird more likely to forage on lobster krill later in the foraging trip. I.e. if they didn't get
enough of their preferred food source (fish/squid) then they would pursue more lobster krill.
As mentioned in L24, can you mention other “species-specific behavioural adaptations” that
allow prey to avoid predation in discussion.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors have used animal-borne video recordings to get detailed information about the
foraging strategies used by penguins. Overall they show some interesting strategies, concluding
that observed predation rates should not be used to infer prey abundance.
One issue that can’t be avoided by studies like this is the possibility that the cameras themselves
affect feeding behaviour (e.g. due to the substantial extra drag created).
The manuscript is well written and succinct. The guide seems generally very well written for
users to follow, with nice examples and figures, and the included videos are excellent to watch.
I haven’t tested the R code, but approve of the authors’ use of freely available tools.
Major issues:
One potentially major technical issue is the method used to analyse prey clustering densities. The
‘Make Binary’ tool used to threshold the image (in order to separate prey from background sea)
uses adaptive histogram-based thresholding (e.g. see here:
https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/menus/process.html ). Meaning if the prey fill only a small area
of the image (e.g. are far away) the tool will use a different thresholding level to images where the
prey take up a larger area. Below I’ve suggested some alternative (more objective and repeatable)
methods.
Minor points:
L140-141 Prey-specific capture behaviours do not imply that the predator is “cognitively aware of
the consequences presented by each prey type” at all. It’s safe to assume that this is an evolved or
individually learnt response that does require any higher form of understanding. e.g. a spider
that cuts a wasp free of its web, while it attacks flies in its web would not be cognitively aware of
the consequences.
L61-62 How was prey size determined relative to the bill? There aren’t easy landmarks to use for
this while ensuring the prey are at a fixed distance from the camera. The guide doesn’t seem to
cover this unless I’ve missed it.
Supplementary Guide:
Concerning using MPEG Streamclip to convert videos to .AVI format, AVI is simply a container,
and doesn’t specify the codec, which in practice is of far greater importance. Converting from
(presumably) h.264 to another codec could result in frame shifts that disagree with FFMPEG,
which is used alter on. In practice I doubt this is an issue, but it is a little messy.
Concerning the use of ImageJ, the method used to calculate prey density is not currently
appropriate as I understand it. First, the authors use the “Make Binary” command, which
thresholds the image based on an image histogram analysis function. This could easily introduce
systematic bias and/or eliminate variance in the dataset as the tool will attempt to make each
thresholded image have a similar overall coverage. Even the example provided suggests that the
thresholding being used is over zealous. Instead, the authors should use the adaptive background
subtraction tool (always using the same settings), convert to 8-bit, then apply a threshold with a
pre-specified thresholding level which must be the same for the entire study.
Second, using the wand tool to select the thresholded pixels will miss out separate clusters, and is
not a very repeatable/reliable measure. Instead, doing something like thresholding the image,
then ‘edit>selection>create selection’ to create an ROI. Next, to include all the internal areas you
6
could do something like ‘edit>selection>enlarge’ and select e.g. 100px, then repeat and select -
100px (to make the selection smaller again). This will at least be a more objective way to include
slightly separate clusters which is somewhat robust against the odd individual pixel being out on
its own, or lots of internal spaces (though obviously the same threshold and radius values need to
be used for the entire study).
Finally, an easier route to working out the percentage cover is simply to use the normal ‘measure’
command, and divide the mean by 2.55 (i.e. 255/100) to get a percentage (no need to analyse
particles).

Associate Editor's comments:
Dear authors,
Your manuscript examining predator-prey interactions directly is a welcome piece of direct
evidence in place of the commonly used proxies for these relationships. Your development of a
new use of technology and your willingness to share it with others is admirable. The manuscript
is very clear.
The reviewers have brought up some excellent points for you to address, and I have some
suggestions (below) in addition to the reviewer comments. I look forward to seeing the revised
version of your manuscript.
My best,
Corina Logan
Associate Editor
Introduction
37 - by “higher order” do you mean “higher trophic order”? Please clarify.
39 - by “third-order selection” do you mean proxies or indirect evidence of the relationships
rather than investigating the relationships directly? I prefer to avoid jargon to make the ms more
readable to a broad audience.
Methods
56 - up to 90 minutes consecutively? Or was the camera programmed to turn off and on at
random points in time over the course of a day or two?
57 - what was the range of durations of the foraging trips? So you put the camera on a bird, it
went on a foraging trip (with the camera recording for up to 90 min, which would depend in part
on how long the foraging trip lasted), and then you recaptured the bird immediately and
removed the camera? Did the birds need to habituate to the camera? How do you know the
camera didn’t affect their behavior? How was the camera attached to the bird? A photo of a bird
wearing a camera would be nice. I realize your methods section is short likely because you
originally submitted it to Biology Letters, however there are no word limits at Royal Society
Open Science so please flesh out the methods to make your study replicable. To aid in this, I
would move everything in your Supplemental Material above Video Analysis (Study Sites and
Prey Identification with figures S1 and S2) to your Methods section in the main manuscript.
60 - define position (GPS position? Not depth because you would use a logger to determine
this…) and orientation (you coded head up and head down. anything else?). This information
will make it clearer how physical features and light intensity levels played a role in your video
coding.
62 - how was prey size estimated relative to penguin bill size? Smaller than, larger then, and
about the same size? Or did you use a more precise measuring method? I imagine the distance
9
from the penguin’s bill would change prey size estimations because of the camera’s depth
perception (or lack thereof). Was this addressed?
67 - please name and cite the R package you used for the GLMM.
69 - how did you define “which best encompassed a swarm” such that video coders could be
consistent with each other? Did you conduct inter/intra-observer reliability analyses to
determine how repeatable the video analyses were?
70 - please provide a citation for R.
Results
75 - does this mean there were n=31 foraging trips?
78 - what was the range of APCs per bird per foraging trip?
79 - describe what you mean by “each type”. Each type of striking movement? If so, briefly
explain what the types are here.
81 - please clarify what a “standard length” is.
84 - add “two” so it reads “on two unidentifiable items”.
88 - “similar characteristic in head strike movement” - similar to what?
94 - how do you know they were in the pelagic section of the water column? Was there a data
logger on the bird that recorded depth?
108 - define “cooperative feeding”
108 - conspecific and interspecific penguin social interactions were not mentioned in the methods.
Was this a posthoc addition? If so, please state it. In either case, please provide information about
how you collected these data and what constituted an interaction (could it be affiliative or
aggressive? Or did you just count proximity if another penguin appeared in the camera view?).
- Please place your GLMM model outputs for both models and the ANOVA outputs in the
Results section of the main text.
Discussion
130 - please make it clear that gentoo penguins are in the family Speniscidae.
141 - I suggest avoiding the term “cognitively aware” because cognitive abilities were not
investigated in this study. What about “…gentoo penguins may attend to the specific challenges
presented by each prey type”?
142 - replace “be aware of” with “attend to”.
144 - please give a bit more detail about how the predator pass-along effect relates to spreading
risk. Maybe a hypothetical example would help illustrate the point?
Ethics
152 - how is a research grant part of an ethics protocol?
10
Data Accessibility
The data would be much more accessible if it was deposited in a data repository (e.g.,
https://knb.ecoinformatics.org), which is searchable. If it is just in supplementary material it gets
lost because search engines don’t pick this up. It’s up to you, but I thought I would point this out.
Figure Legends
226 - this is the first mention of birds being unsuccessful, which makes me wonder: were all APCs
unsuccessful attempts at capturing prey? If you know the prey capture outcomes of APCs it
would be good to include some information on this in the Results (and mention it in the
Methods).
234 - “Total number of observations” of what? Prey items? And percentage of what? Percentage
of the total observed prey items for a particular category (table row)?
234 - in Table 1, change column title “Orientation” to “Penguin orientation”, and change column
title “All” to “All prey items” for clarity.
Figure 1a - the legend says “Probability of gentoo penguin attack on differing swarm density of
lobster krill”, however none of the axes are labeled “probability” or “attack”. I presume Feed/No
feed is the probability of attack? Please explain what the Frequency axis label refers to (i.e.,
frequency of what). Also clarify in the legend that swarm density is percent cover (as it is labeled
in the figure axis - if this is what it means).
Figure 1b - also explain in the legend that the top row of photos are the photos and the bottom
row is the pixel conversion.
Movies S1-S3 - the text in the first few seconds wasn’t visible
CSV files - do you describe what all of the column titles mean (and their units) somewhere? I
couldn’t find this information.
R code - very well documented!

thresholds the image based on an image histogram analysis function. This could easily introduce
systematic bias and/or eliminate variance in the dataset as the tool will attempt to make each
thresholded image have a similar overall coverage. Even the example provided suggests that the
thresholding being used is over zealous. Instead, the authors should use the adaptive background
subtraction tool (always using the same settings), convert to 8-bit, then apply a threshold with a
pre-specified thresholding level which must be the same for the entire study.
Second, using the wand tool to select the thresholded pixels will miss out separate clusters, and is
not a very repeatable/reliable measure. Instead, doing something like thresholding the image,
then ‘edit>selection>create selection’ to create an ROI. Next, to include all the internal areas you
could do something like ‘edit>selection>enlarge’ and select e.g. 100px, then repeat and select -
100px (to make the selection smaller again). This will at least be a more objective way to include
slightly separate clusters which is somewhat robust against the odd individual pixel being out on
its own, or lots of internal spaces (though obviously the same threshold and radius values need to
be used for the entire study).
Finally, an easier route to working out the percentage cover is simply to use the normal ‘measure’
command, and divide the mean by 2.55 (i.e. 255/100) to get a percentage (no need to analyse
particles).

This manuscript describes predator-prey interactions from video loggers. The manuscript has
been simplified from the last version I reviewed and the text is much clearer. I have just a few
comments and questions below.
L52-56. If you are going to specifically talk about the results of a study you need to make sure
what you are saying is correct. 1) GPS devices were not used. Argos satellite tags and TDRs were
used. 2) The study did not try to determine whether diffuse or dense aggregations influenced
vertical segregation. The study used an AUV to document krill aggregations and their habitat
associations within penguin foraging ranges. Separately, tag data showed spatial and vertical
segregation of foraging habitat between species. Main point<U+2192> Investigators were unable to
determine whether krill aggregation characteristics or species-specific penguin behaviors drove
the vertical segregation between species because krill aggregation data was not available for
every penguin dive.
L64 delete “diving”
L69 Replace “sampled” with “tagged”
L111. Is there anything about prey size in the results?
L115 If a bird is far from an aggregation does it look clustered, even though it could be loosely
clustered?
L135 Did birds at BR and CB have the same behavior, predator-prey dynamics? Did you test for
differences between the two locations?
L184 Do you mean active defense of individuals and active defense of a group? It is unlikely that
the group alone is deterring predator, it is mostly likely due to active defense of many prey
grouped together.
How harmful is a lobster krill pinch to a penguin? After spending so much time monitoring the
colonies did the authors observe any injuries on the penguins face etc.?
L227 delete “the”
L245-48 But are you able to say there is an abundance of prey at the Falkland Islands compared to
all other locations? This needs to be rephrased.
L249 replace “may not be able to” with “cannot”
L250 I do not understand what is being said here, can you clarify? “our study provides insight to
why there may be a mismatch between predator and prey distribution observed for gentoo
penguins elsewhere”
Figure 1. Can you make stars larger, it is hard to distinguish?
16
Are there past studies that documented the proportion of prey items in the diet of gentoos at
these colonies? Based on those studies, are the species you see penguins consume in the video the
same? Prey types may change as a function of distance from shore and you are only documenting
the near shore prey so how representative is predator-prey dynamics described here with what
penguins experience throughout their entire foraging range.
Because you manuscript is short, it seems that some of the supplementary material can be
brought into the main text.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
This paper uses evidence from video loggers to assess predator-prey interactions, with an
emphasis on describing prey-mediated changes in behavior of a predator. It is an admirable bit of
work, no doubt challenging to collect in the field and collate for analysis. Having deployed
cameras on this and other species recently, I appreciate the effort. Based on my own (limited)
experience with video-derived data, I think the methods are efficient, well-aimed, and will be
useful for future studies to learn from. I also recognize this is a revised manuscript and note the
authors’ work to address prior concerns and recommendations. Nonetheless, I do have two main
comments that I would encourage the authors to address in an additional revision.
First, the paper suffers from both brevity and excess that limits its clarity and impact. I would
urge the authors to spend time adding detail and specificity to the text, while at the same time
eliminating unnecessary methods. I have tried to offer specific examples of where such focus
would be helpful in specific comments, below.
17
Second, and perhaps most importantly, on lines 168-175 are found the results around which the
paper is fully framed. Yet there are no descriptions here of the anti-predator behaviors that
lobster krill used to defend themselves individually and only brief mention of tight versus loose
clustering that appears to be related to predation attempts. And what about the behavior of other
prey items encountered – can you include more here about fleeing fish and squids – was that
active defense effective? In general, I think more attention to these anti-predator observations,
specific reference to additional images that solidify the importance of such behaviors, and the
presence (of lack of) obvious anti-predator behavior among the suite of prey encountered by the
gentoo penguins is critical to include given the main goal of the paper to advocate for considering
how prey behaviors modify predation.
Abstract
Line 30: Consider including a bit of “how” to this sentence. For example, perhaps something
along these lines: “The video evidence demonstrates that aggressive behavioral defense
mechanisms of prey influence prey capture by a seabird by deterring predation attempts
altogether or reducing the success of predation attempts .”
Line 34-36: Again, a bit of “how” is missing here. How is trophic coupling significantly
influenced? I think a more useful conclusion based on the video evidence is that prey behavior
affects predator foraging success and that this is important to consider when characterizing
predator-prey relationships through the lens of traditional diet studies.
Introduction
Line 40-43: This opening sentence is vague and lacks pop to draw in a reader. What kind of
“studies” are you refereeing to? What kind of “sampling” do you mean? Be precise and specific
to help introduce the study to follow.
Line 53-55: Consider editing this to read: Here we demonstrate how in situ studies can provide
direct evidence about...of food items available while foraging and how such data can improve our
…Consider making it 2 sentences, as well.
Line 62-63: This sentence is unclear. How “what” may hold? Do you mean the degree to which
prey mediate predator behavior and how interactions change with different prey types?
M&M
Throughout – consider replacing “annotated for” with “recorded”.
Line 107 – delete “or not”
Line 108 – Can the definition of APC be simplified to include only the first part regarding actively
moving the head toward a prey item. I do not understand how the attempt to capture the prey
requires the rest of the definition.
Line 121-133 – I felt like this entire paragraph could be deleted with zero impact on rest of the
paper, as there is no presentation in the results that requires these analyses. If retained, convince
the reader that some output of diveMove and crawl was essential to the data your present in the
paper.
Results
Line 146- check if this number should be 88 (or 78, I think).
Line 154 –just to clarify, but are the 109 missed prey included in the total APC tally?
18
Line 157 – consider starting a new paragraph here.
Line 159 – presumably you have depth data from the dive logger to more accurately describe the
depth distribution of APCs, particularly those instances in the water column? I think it is useful
to include such depth data, as it is clear from the video that you have both demersal and
“pelagic” feeding.
Discission
Line 188 -198. Consider moving this to the end of the discussion and focus here on the main
results.
Line 206. Consider “The confusion effect arises when prey behavior limits the ability of a
predator …..items from tightly packed groups and presents a …”
Line 251-255 –Again, there is a lack of clarity in this closing that limits the impact of the study.
What caution must be taken? Can you provide clarity on how to consider the mechanisms of
prey-predator interactions? The point that relationships between prey and predators can be
complicated by behavior and that naïve assumptions about such behaviors may cloud our
inference is useful, but I think you need to lean on specific observations from your study to
strengthen your conclusions.

Dear authors,
Thank you very much for so carefully addressing the previous comments on your manuscript. I
think it was a wise decision to remove the image analysis aspect and to make this more of a
natural history note. This change strengthens and clarifies your findings.
Your revised manuscript was reviewed by two reviewers and I added comments (below) as well
(please note that my comments refer to line numbers from the Tracked Changes pdf version of
your paper). I am happy to provide a favorable decision for your manuscript after you revise
your manuscript per these comments.
All my best,
Corina Logan
Associate Editor
Corina Logan’s comments
43 - This still isn’t clear; my previous comment still applies: by “third-order selection” do you
mean proxies or indirect evidence of the relationships rather than investigating the relationships
directly? I prefer to avoid jargon to make the ms more readable to a broad audience. In your
example of “ie usage of various habitat components within the home range”, it isn’t clear how
habitat use could provide indirect evidence for predator-prey interactions. Please rephrase to
something like “have primarily evaluated predator-prey relationships via indirect evidence”.
59 - “fourth-order selection” needs to be explained here as above. It appears that fourth-order
selection is data that were observed at the individual level?
69 - “all species” of penguins? Or all seabird species, or?
90 - Please list the manufacturer of Roto Stik
91 - “facilitated recapture” by making the birds more visible?
93 - Please change to “bill depth” rather than just “depth” which could be confusing with water
depth. Please also state that you removed the camera.
93 - The word “retrospectively” is confusing - please remove it and say “We later searched for
sampled birds…”
125 - Please list the categories of prey sizes that were coded (e.g., smaller than, larger than, or
similar size as the penguin’s bill)
133 - “Summarized” is still unclear and I’m not sure what “custom codes” means either. What did
you do with the files in R?
136 - This paragraph should be removed because it refers to the TDR devices that are no longer
part of this paper. Unless I misunderstood this, in which case, please state what data you
analyzed with diveMove that are presented in this paper.
155 - Does this refer to an analysis that was taken out?
Methods: you state in the intro that you “develop a widely applicable freeware protocol”,
however it is not apparent where you describe this approach in the methods. Do you end up
developing a protocol in this paper or was this part removed as well? If it was removed, please
22
remove all references to it. It you kept it in, please describe it in every section of the paper. If the
description is in the supplementary material, consider moving this to the main paper (or at least
the bulk of it).
159 - Please add the range of footage hours per bird in parenthesis in this sentence to give an
indication of the distribution of your data.
161 - Please clarify why do you suspect these to be non-breeders. Do non-breeders not return to
their exit point or do they stay out for days at a time? Also, add a citation to support the
statement about non-breeding behavior.
162 - Change “departed” to “entered the water”
167 - It is still unclear what “type” refers to here. Are there different types of APCs? If so, they
should be listed in the methods and summarized here to make it easier for the reader to follow.
167 - Please change “These were on” to “The prey involved in APCs included”
168 - I don’t know what a fish standard length is. Will you please add a description for about how
long this is in mm? It appears that you do give mm measurements, in which case I am unclear
what “fish standard length” adds to the sentence. If it does add something, please clarify what
that is. If you do end up clarifying fish standard length, make sure to add “fish” to “standard
length” on line 171.
177 - Thank you very much for clarifying this paragraph. One additional question that comes up
for me is whether you know that head strike movements are different for small fish as opposed to
medium or large fish? If an ethogram is published on this topic that makes this distinction, please
cite it. Otherwise, if you are relying on personal observations, please describe the difference and
cite yourselves (pers. obs.).
184 - Please clarify what position and orientation are and how they are distinct from each other.
196 - How are these 5 birds different from the 10 birds in the previous sentence? It isn’t clear how
the krill differed in these two sentences either so please clarify.
205 - “cooperatively” is still undefined in the text. Please add a definition (e.g., more than one
penguin foraging on the same krill swarm). The term “cooperative” has many different meanings
in different fields so it is important to state how you are using the term in this context. This
comment also applies to your discussion (lines 256-272)
218 - Please clarify this paragraph. It looks like the point was to refer to other literature that
indicates that the tags you used likely didn’t influence the behavior of the penguins and then to
provide some anecdotal evidence from your video footage that this appears to be the case. The
first part of the paragraph is confusing because it looks like you are saying that you looked at tag
effects in this study. The second part of the paragraph needs clarification: why would you expect
a non-active prey pursuit method to indicate the birds were not affected by the tag and how do
you know this is a typical pursuit method if you only have footage from birds with tags on (and
no comparison with birds without tags)? It is possible that their non-active method was typical
because they were wearing the camera.
237 - Replace “this behavior” with “swarming behavior”
275 - Please replace “supporting optimal foraging theory” with “which might indicate that their
23
behavior is consistent with optimal foraging theory”. You didn’t test optimal foraging theory as a
hypothesis so you can’t say that your evidence supports a hypothesis you didn’t test.
275 - Please replace “Thus, it appears” with “Our anecdotes may indicate that” per the previous
comment.
278 - Replace “can attend to” with “may attend to”. You didn’t test (using a manipulation) what
they were attending to so it is important to keep the language exploratory.
279 - Replace “be aware of” with “keep track of”. The word “awareness” comes with all kinds of
connotations that are best avoided (e.g., see literature in psychology).
285 - It is still unclear why you think this population is unique. Do you know that individuals in
this population eat prey species that no other populations eat? It seems unlikely given that yours
is the first direct evidence of what penguins eat in the wild while on foraging trips. I would
remove “potentially unique to” and “owing to their varied diet across their range”.
303 - The link to the Dryad repository is broken so I was unable to evaluate the materials there.
Figure 1 - Please label each of the bottom 4 panels with CB or BR so it is clear which is which.
Figure 2 - Do you mean “The birds in these photos were unsuccessful at capturing the pictured
prey”?
Figure 3 - You don’t have evidence of avoidance behavior but rather frequency of whether they
fed at a swarm or not. Please rephrase to something like they fed off of loosely clustered swarms
and not tightly clustered swarms.
Data at Dryad - because I can’t see what is at Dryad (the link is broken), I relied on the file
Handley_RSOS_Supp_Material_File_Instructions_REVISED.docx. It appears from this file that
only a few of the data files for this study are available at Dryad, which means that one couldn’t
replicate the analysis using the R code because it is not all available at Dryad. To comply with
label_version_3
RSOS’s open data policy (http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/author-
information#Open_data), please upload all of the data sheets that you analyzed for this paper so
that someone can see what you did and could replicate your analysis if they wanted to. You also

Line 157 – consider starting a new paragraph here.
Line 159 – presumably you have depth data from the dive logger to more accurately describe the
depth distribution of APCs, particularly those instances in the water column? I think it is useful
to include such depth data, as it is clear from the video that you have both demersal and
“pelagic” feeding.
Discission
Line 188 -198. Consider moving this to the end of the discussion and focus here on the main
results.
Line 206. Consider “The confusion effect arises when prey behavior limits the ability of a
predator …..items from tightly packed groups and presents a …”
Line 251-255 –Again, there is a lack of clarity in this closing that limits the impact of the study.
What caution must be taken? Can you provide clarity on how to consider the mechanisms of
prey-predator interactions? The point that relationships between prey and predators can be
complicated by behavior and that naïve assumptions about such behaviors may cloud our
inference is useful, but I think you need to lean on specific observations from your study to
strengthen your conclusions.

Dear authors,
Many thanks for your very clear tracking of changes in the PDF - that was really helpful. Thank
you also for addressing all of the additional comments. I reviewed the revision and your
responses to the comments, and there are five points (below) that would be good to clarify when
submitting the final version. Once these changes have been made, I am happy to accept this
manuscript on behalf of Royal Society Open Science. I look forward to seeing it online.

Associate Editor
73 - Please clarify what “marine samplers” means
180 - Please clarify whether APC “type” refers to the different types of prey involved in APCs or
whether there are 7 different types of movements the penguins engage in when in an APC. It
looks like “type” refers to different types of prey, in which case, please reword from “Seven types
of APCs were recorded” to “APCs involved foraging on seven different prey types”, and on line
183 change from “The prey involved in different types of APCs included” to “The seven types of
prey involved in the APCs included”
Results: in your response you state “Also, at the beginning of the results, we now make reference
to where along the foraging path footage is recorded from”, however, I couldn’t find a mention of
this in the revised paper. Please make sure to include this in the results section.
231 - Please add a sentence to the beginning of this paragraph stating the main point for how it
30
relates to your study. I interpret this to be something along the lines of “While we did not
measure the effects of tags on the behavior on the individuals in our study, we expect tag effects
to be negligible for the following reasons.”
Data at Dryad
1) I was able to access the link for review, thanks for adding this. I saw data files with BR in the
title and BR in the data, but no data for CB. Is the CB data at Dryad as well? If so, please label it. If
not, please add it.
2) Please clarify whether you are in compliance with RSOS’s open data policy
(http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/author- information#Open_data). Ensure that you have
uploaded all of the data sheets that you analyzed for this paper so that someone can see what you

Dear Alice Power,
Thank you for assisting with the Research Article entitled
“Behaviourally mediated predation avoidance in penguin prey” for
consideration by your journal. We have revised the paper as per the
editor and reviewer suggestions.
The original title was kept quite short as the original manuscript was
submitted to Biology Letters. Considering the waivered word count for
Royal Society Open Science, we have the amended the title as follows:
“Behaviourally mediated predation avoidance in penguin prey: In situ
evidence from animal-borne camera loggers”
Our article provides the first in situ evidence for a marine case study, of
how multiple behaviours by prey can influence predator foraging
success for a seabird. We achieved this by using a scalable biologging
approach and developing a widely applicable methodology for any user
studying marine organisms with animal-borne camera loggers.
The key implication of our study is that prey behaviour can significantly
influence trophic coupling in marine systems and should be accounted
for in studies using marine top predators as samplers of mid to lower
trophic level species.
The article enhances our understanding of marine ecology and holds
wide applicability to academics, resource managers and ecological
modellers. Furthermore, the study provides valuable material for
educators and science communicators.
We also provide a detailed outline of our approach in an electronic
supplementary material, which directs user to necessary software (all
freeware) and R code.
All authors (Jonathan M Handley, Andréa Thiebault, Andrew Stanworth,
David Schutt, Pierre Pistorius) have agreed to be listed and approved
the submitted version of the manuscript.
Thank you for your consideration of this manuscript.
Sincerely,
Jonathan Handley
Appendix B
Response to editors for research article: Behaviourally mediated
predation avoidance in penguin prey
Authors: Jonathan M Handley, Andréa Thiebault, Andrew Stanworth,
David Schutt, Pierre Pistorius
Dear Corina, Reviewer 1 and Jolyon,
We would like to thank you for taking the time to review our manuscript. Your
suggestions have been very helpful.
As our manuscript was originally submitted to Biology Letters it was originally
quite succinct. Following the valuable comments we have now included more
specific details and additional information.
The title of the article has been amended to greater incorporate the message
of the paper: “Behaviourally mediated predation avoidance in penguin
prey: In situ evidence from animal-borne camera loggers”
We would like to first acknowledge one key point made by Jolyon. This
relates to the method we used to determine prey density with ImageJ and the
“make binary” option. After careful consideration, we must agree with Jolyon
that our method did not suffice.
This is unfortunate as we were hoping the method would be a useful tool for
the community. However, Jolyon’s expertise in image analysis is welcomed.
Hopefully, we can work together in future.
Despite this, our interpretation of the data still leads us to conclude that
gentoo penguins are less likely to attack dense swarms of lobster krill. And, it
is clear that in circumstances of abundant prey, birds did not attack these
prey. Thus, misinterpretation could arise when relating prey abundance to
predator distribution. Necessitating the importance of our study and in situ
observations.
We have amended the manuscript to reflect the valuable suggestions.
As there have been many changes to the text, we include a MARKED word
document with track changes. The MARKED word document has the position
of all specific reviewer comments highlighted and the comments are included
as notes, which have the reviewer’s initials. We address comments below too
and author replies are highlighted in bold. Author replies include the
line number of the amended text in the REVISED manuscript.
Many thanks,
Jonathan Handley
Associate Editor's comments:
Dear authors,
Your manuscript examining predator-prey interactions directly is a welcome
piece of direct evidence in place of the commonly used proxies for these
relationships. Your development of a new use of technology and your
willingness to share it with others is admirable. The manuscript is very clear.
The reviewers have brought up some excellent points for you to address, and
I have some suggestions (below) in addition to the reviewer comments. I look
forward to seeing the revised version of your manuscript.
My best,
Corina Logan
Associate Editor
Introduction
37 - by “higher order” do you mean “higher trophic order”? Please clarify.
Reply (L38): Yes, text amended: “where sampling of higher trophic
order predatory species”
39 - by “third-order selection” do you mean proxies or indirect evidence of the
relationships rather than investigating the relationships directly? I prefer to
avoid jargon to make the ms more readable to a broad audience.
Reply (L40-43): Yes, text amended, and example in paragraph included.
“in terms of third-order selection (ie, usage of various habitat
components within the home range) [4]. This has been achieved using
technology such as animal-borne tracking devices and either trawls or
acoustic monitoring, to investigate predator and prey distribution,
respectively [2,3]”
Methods
Reply: As there have been many changes to the methods we refer the
reviewer to the MARKED manuscript.
56 - up to 90 minutes consecutively? Or was the camera programmed to turn
off and on at random points in time over the course of a day or two?
Reply: Camera’s recorded for a single 90 minute batch, thus they were
deployed on birds prior to departing for a trip. The amended methods
reflect this.
57 - what was the range of durations of the foraging trips? So you put the
camera on a bird, it went on a foraging trip (with the camera recording for up
to 90 min, which would depend in part on how long the foraging trip lasted),
and then you recaptured the bird immediately and removed the camera? Did
the birds need to habituate to the camera? How do you know the camera
didn’t affect their behavior? How was the camera attached to the bird? A
photo of a bird wearing a camera would be nice. I realize your methods
section is short likely because you originally submitted it to Biology Letters,
however there are no word limits at Royal Society Open Science so please
flesh out the methods to make your study replicable. To aid in this, I would
move everything in your Supplemental Material above Video Analysis (Study
Sites and Prey Identification with figures S1 and S2) to your Methods section
in the main manuscript.
Reply: The methods sections has been amended quite heavily to
include much more detail. Thank you for suggestions.
60 - define position (GPS position? Not depth because you would use a
logger to determine this…) and orientation (you coded head up and head
down. anything else?). This information will make it clearer how physical
features and light intensity levels played a role in your video coding.
Reply: We include in the supplementary material a file detailing each
behavioural category. We include more detail in the text too.
62 - how was prey size estimated relative to penguin bill size? Smaller than,
larger then, and about the same size? Or did you use a more precise
measuring method? I imagine the distance from the penguin’s bill would
change prey size estimations because of the camera’s depth perception (or
lack thereof). Was this addressed?
Reply (L 107-109): The measurement was done only in relation to the
bill. Based on when prey was directly adjacent to/inside the bill. The text
is amended as follows:
“Prey size was estimated by comparing it to penguin bill size at the
moment the prey was adjacent to the bill. Thus, limiting the effect of
unknown distance which could confound this measurement”
67 - please name and cite the R package you used for the GLMM.
Reply: This has been removed from the text considering the removal of
the prey density estimate.
69 - how did you define “which best encompassed a swarm” such that video
coders could be consistent with each other? Did you conduct inter/intra-
observer reliability analyses to determine how repeatable the video analyses
were?
Reply: This has been removed from the text considering the removal of
the prey density estimate.
70 - please provide a citation for R.
Reply: R is cited in the text. Thank you
Results
75 - does this mean there were n=31 foraging trips?
Reply (L 131-134): Only 31 with valid data. 3 birds did not return and we
suspect these to be non-breeders. 4 birds did not depart the beach in
time, therefore, we recorded 90 minutes of sky. Text amended as
follows:
“We obtained suitable footage from 14 and 17 birds at Bull Roads (BR)
and Cow Bay (CB), respectively, yielding a total of 35.6 hours of footage
while birds were at sea. In the remaining cases, three birds were not
recaptured, and we suspect these to have been non-breeders. The other
four birds were recaptured, but only departed after the cameras had
ceased recording”
78 - what was the range of APCs per bird per foraging trip?
Reply (L136-137): This information is now included in the text as
follows:
“An average of 52 [0-284, median/range] and a total of 1932 APCs were
identified for each bird and across all birds, respectively”
79 - describe what you mean by “each type”. Each type of striking
movement? If so, briefly explain what the types are here.
Reply: We mean each type of prey encounter event. These are detailed
in the preceding line and highlighted in the video footage. The amended
methods also describe what we define as an attempted prey capture.
Thank you
81 - please clarify what a “standard length” is.
Reply (L134-135): This is a type of measurement typical to fish. The text
now reads: “fish standard length”
84 - add “two” so it reads “on two unidentifiable items”.
Reply. Corrected, thank you.
88 - “similar characteristic in head strike movement” - similar to what?
Reply (L146-147): Text amended to reflect what it is similar too:
“and the similar characteristic in head strike movement when small fish
were definitively observed”
94 - how do you know they were in the pelagic section of the water column?
Was there a data logger on the bird that recorded depth?
Reply (L153-156): This was evident from the camera footage. The data
logger (TDR) does give us information on depth, however, this data will
be the subject of another study. The text is amended as follows:
“Based on the position and orientation of birds evident in the camera
footage, birds primarily fed while ascending, followed nearly equally by
feeding in the water column where orientation was unclear (pelagic
foraging) or with upward strikes of the head while foraging along the
sea floor”
108 - define “cooperative feeding”
Reply (L170): This is when birds might be hunting prey collectively. Text
amended for clarity as follows:
“There was no evidence of birds hunting prey cooperatively, as birds
from both colonies”
108 - conspecific and interspecific penguin social interactions were not
mentioned in the methods. Was this a posthoc addition? If so, please state it.
In either case, please provide information about how you collected these data
and what constituted an interaction (could it be affiliative or aggressive? Or
did you just count proximity if another penguin appeared in the camera
view?).
Reply (L172-174): This was based on observations from the camera
footage. The methods are amended to reflect how we recorded this,
supplementary video footage of these interactions has been included,
and the results now read:
“When interactions did occur, they appeared to be either chance
encounters with the subject bird either ignoring other individuals or
following them briefly (electronic supplementary material: movie S4).”
- Please place your GLMM model outputs for both models and the ANOVA
outputs in the Results section of the main text.
Reply: This has been removed from the text considering the removal of
the prey density estimate.
Discussion
130 - please make it clear that gentoo penguins are in the family
Speniscidae.
Reply (L218-219): The mention of a family name has been removed and
text has been amended as follows:
“For other the penguin species, variable evidence suggests that birds
may forage individually or cooperatively”
141 - I suggest avoiding the term “cognitively aware” because cognitive
abilities were not investigated in this study. What about “…gentoo penguins
may attend to the specific challenges presented by each prey type”?
Reply (L230-231): Thank you for this suggestion. Text amended as
follows:
“This behaviour, and those discussed above, imply that birds can
attend to the specific challenges presented by each prey type”
142 - replace “be aware of” with “attend to”.
Reply: We were unsure of this comment as the original text reads:
“Furthermore, gentoo penguins may be aware of potential prey
availability within their home range when one considers the ‘predator
pass-along effect’”
144 - please give a bit more detail about how the predator pass-along effect
relates to spreading risk. Maybe a hypothetical example would help illustrate
the point?
Reply (L233-236): We are not aware of empirical examples in the
literature and the referenced paper discusses this mechanism from a
theoretical stand point. The text has been amended to include more
information:
“This mechanism is driven by predator movement as a consequence of
un-successful attacks, and suggests that a predator might spread the
risk over many hunting sites to manage prey behaviour, benefiting the
predator’s long-term energy intake”
Ethics
152 - how is a research grant part of an ethics protocol?
Reply: We changed the word grant to permit; in that specific research
permit there is a section on ethics.
Data Accessibility
The data would be much more accessible if it was deposited in a data
repository (e.g., https://knb.ecoinformatics.org), which is searchable. If it is
just in supplementary material it gets lost because search engines don’t pick
this up. It’s up to you, but I thought I would point this out.
Reply: Many thanks for this.
Figure Legends
226 - this is the first mention of birds being unsuccessful, which makes me
wonder: were all APCs unsuccessful attempts at capturing prey? If you know
the prey capture outcomes of APCs it would be good to include some
information on this in the Results (and mention it in the Methods).
Reply: Please see the amended methods which now include further
detail on what an APC entailed.
234 - “Total number of observations” of what? Prey items? And percentage of
what? Percentage of the total observed prey items for a particular category
(table row)?
Reply: This figure has been removed in light of Jolyon’s comments.
234 - in Table 1, change column title “Orientation” to “Penguin orientation”,
and change column title “All” to “All prey items” for clarity.
Reply. These have been amended. Thank you
Figure 1a - the legend says “Probability of gentoo penguin attack on differing
swarm density of lobster krill”, however none of the axes are labeled
“probability” or “attack”. I presume Feed/No feed is the probability of attack?
Please explain what the Frequency axis label refers to (i.e., frequency of
what). Also clarify in the legend that swarm density is percent cover (as it is
labeled in the figure axis - if this is what it means).
Figure 1b - also explain in the legend that the top row of photos are the
photos and the bottom row is the pixel conversion.
Reply: This figure has been removed in light of Jolyon’s comments.
Movies S1-S3 - the text in the first few seconds wasn’t visible
Reply: The text in the original videos appears to be visible in the first
few seconds. We will try to make sure that everything is okay when
uploading the videos again. Thank you.
CSV files - do you describe what all of the column titles mean (and their units)
somewhere? I couldn’t find this information.
Reply: A new supplementary file is now included.
R code - very well documented!
Reply. Thank you, we hope it will be useful for others.

Comments to the Author(s)
In this study, gentoo penguins were equipped with cameras to document
predator-prey dynamics. The supplemental videos examples were well done
and very useful in showing different penguin behaviors, prey capture and
prey distributional characteristics. This study is unique in that it reveals
gentoo penguins avoided foraging on aggregations of lobster krill and the
ability of lobster krill to avoid predation by using their claws to pinch the
penguin. Anther interesting finding was that penguin only pursued higher
energy prey items (larger fish/squid) when missed. The behavior of the
predator and prey in this sense is novel but in general, the importance of this
behavior to gentoo penguins throughout their entire range is limited because
gentoo penguins at other locations do not feed on lobster krill or other
species with a defense mechanism. Therefore, the text needs to be altered to
include these points. In addition, it seems like the most logical explanation for
why penguins are not foraging on aggregations is due to communal defense
(not confusion effect) as there are many examples in the literature of
penguins foraging on aggregating species. Another aspect the authors have
not included is that the gentoo penguin is known to be flexible in their diet,
behavior, and other life history strategies. This provides another example of
their flexible diet, foraging strategies based on available food, and ability to
forage alone (vs. other studies that show the importance of group foraging).
Reply: Thank you reviewer 1 for valuable comments. The revised text
now includes aspect relating to this observation being specific to the
Falklands, however, that it does have implications for gentoo penguins
at other locations, and other marine predators.
Regarding whether communal defence or confusion effect plays a
primary role in deterring birds from feeding on lobster krill swarms is
difficult to definitively say. Therefore, we keep both hypotheses in the
text and provide additional literature discussing each mechanism.
Major Comments
The results are much overstated. The majority of prey items ingested by
gentoo penguins have no defense system to ward off predation. One of the
conclusions of the study is that we cannot relate predator diet to prey
availability/abundance due to prey behavior. There are many examples in the
literature where you can in fact relate penguin diet to prey availability, which
is ignored here. Including text on gentoo penguin’s main prey species at
other locations would be useful. It would also be useful to give examples of
other prey items with defense systems that penguins forage on. Given this,
only at some locations prey defense mechanisms need to be considered.
Reply: We agree that in many cases prey items will not be able to
defend themselves. However, our study is showing that this is not the
only mechanism which may deter birds from feeding on prey. Also, we
agree that there are examples which show penguin diet to relate to prey
availability. However, the conclusion to our study is as follows (Revised
document, L 242-245):
“The implications of our study are that consideration must be given to
the mechanisms through which predator and prey interact, and that
caution must be taken against over simplifying trophic studies
involving marine top predators.”
Ultimately, we are implying caution and we do not state anywhere in the
text that one
“cannot relate predator diet to prey availability/abundance due to prey
behaviour”.
We are providing evidence as to why some studies may have found
spurious relationships in the past.
We include in the text more information specific to gentoo penguins
and provide additional references specific to penguins regarding the
confusion effect.
More information is need in the tagging section (see more specific comments
below). It should also be noted in the discussion that the effects of foraging
location couldn’t be accounted for because tags did not have GPS. This is
important because an individual may have a preferred foraging location
where prey items are present in different abundances.
Reply: As the original document was intended for Biology Letters the
methods sections was kept quite concise. We have now included many
more details in the methods section given the unlimited word count for
Royal Society Open Science.
Regarding the effect of foraging location, birds did have GPS units and
this information was provided in the supplementary material. We agree
that birds may have a preferred foraging location, however, our study
relates more to the predator-prey interactions that were observed.
Specific Comments
L25. Explain what is novel here. Ex. “develop a novel biologging approach” to
quantify prey characteristics from “animal-borne camera loggers”
Reply (L 25-27): The protocol that we developed was novel. Many
studies that use animal-borne camera loggers discuss their
observations and in our experience hardly any studies (across a broad
range of taxa) make mention of how they quantified video footage
However, considering Jolyon’s comments we amended the protocol we
provide. We still provided a detailed tutorial about how to begin dealing
with video footage for other authors to follow in future and we hope this
will be a valuable tool for the community. Therefore, we have amended
text as follows:
“Here, we develop and describe a scalable biologging protocol, using
animal-borne camera loggers, to elucidate the factors influencing prey
capture by a seabird, the gentoo penguin
”
L33. Not all prey have the ability to avoid capture or defend themselves. This
last sentence is a bit of an overstatement. This only needs to be considered
when prey have aggressive behavior defense mechanisms that can harm the
predator.
Reply: We believe there are multiple mechanisms affecting whether the
predator consumes prey or not. Therefore, we have not amended the
sentence.
L41 distribution? What is meant here?
Reply (L 44-46): This relates to where prey might be found. We have
amended the sentence for clarity as follows:
“others have yielded inconclusive results when relating demographic
parameters, distribution and dietary composition of predators, to the
availability and abundance of prey”
L44. Reword “Multiple factors, both intrinsic,” to “intrinsic factors,”
Reply (L 54-56). Thank you, the sentence has been modified:
“Intrinsic factors, including variable energetic requirements associated
with self-maintenance and reproduction, and extrinsic factors, such as
antipredator behaviour employed by prey target species, are known to
influence prey selection in terrestrial predators”
L48. There are quite a few animal-borne camera logger studies in the
literature. I suggest citing a few here or adding a sentence on how your study
is different.
Reply (56-60): We have cited other papers and added why our study is
important:
“For diving marine diving predators, such as penguins, there is
however limited knowledge regarding how both predator and prey may
influence the success of capture [9–12]. Considering penguins have
been deemed sentinels of the marine environment [13], there is a
pressing need to identify the degree to which this may hold across all
species, and under differing prey regimes”
L51. delete “other point of view”
Reply (L 63-64): The sentence has been modified:
“scalable across other studies which require detailed annotation of
large quantities of video data”
L55. I cannot find Figure S1.
Reply: Sorry for this. It was available in the supplementary material,
which did seem to be available to other reviewers.
L53. Adult penguins? Male or female? How was a penguin chosen for
tagging? Did the tagged penguins have chicks? How were birds recaptured
…luck of finding them again or you waited for the bird to return? How long is
a typical foraging trip? How was the camera attached to the bird (tape,
zipties, etc.)?
Reply: Please see the amended methods section which contains much
more detail.
Were the cameras triggered on by seawater or they recorded from the time of
tagging.
L58. Is it necessary to say “freeware approach”, instead of just approach or
freeware?
Reply: Perhaps not, but we were emphasising this point as many other
options for video annotation require proprietary software.
L61. How were light intensity levels determined?
Reply (L99 -101): These were determined by clear depiction in the
camera when the bird was descending or ascending. The text is
amended as follows:
“Furthermore, the bird’s position and orientation in the water column
was annotated for, based on physical features (sea surface/sea floor)
and the changing light intensity levels, evident when the bird was
ascending or descending”
L62. “Prey size was estimated by comparing it to penguin bill size.” How did
you account for the prey being an unknown distance from the penguin’s bill?
Reply (L 107-109): The measurement was done only in relation to the
bill. Based on when prey was directly adjacent to/inside the bill. The text
is amended as follows:
“Prey size was estimated by comparing it to penguin bill size at the
moment the prey was adjacent to the bill. Thus, limiting the effect of
unknown distance which could confound this measurement ”
L59. Rephrase. “This involved converting video formats from X to X and then
manual annotation of each clip?
Reply (L 95-96): Thank you. The sentence has been amended among a
large change to the methods section and introduction of new
information:
“Using a freeware protocol, we converted video from .MOV to .AVI with
MPEG Streamclip (Version 1.2), and then annotated the footage using
Solomon Coder (Version 16.06.26)”
L62. What does quantifying annotated video files mean?
Reply (L 114-115): This refers to the quantification of events. For
example, number of prey captures, duration of prey event, etc. We
convert the text as follows:
“We summarised annotated video files with custom codes in R”
L66 The fixed effect was density?
Is ImageJ a common technique used to determine zooplankton density from
photographs?
Was there an effect of distance from swarm and percent coverage? The
closer the bird is to the swarm the easier it is to see gaps between individuals
whereas if the bird is far from the swarm it looks like a large blob with no
gaps. Water clarity might impact this as well.
L69-70. This wording makes it sound like ImageJ was performed in R but
here you are talking about GLMM, correct?
For GLMM, need to mention what the random effect was? Why were models
with and without fixed effects compared?
Reply (L109-114): The above methods have been removed following
Jolyon’s comments. Please see the included text:
“When prey were aggregated, we noted whether aggregations were
loosely or tightly clustered. Loose aggregations were characterised as
those which had obvious space between prey items and where one
could clearly see through the aggregation during the entire period that
the bird was approaching. Tightly aggregated prey were characterised
by having no obvious space between prey items and where one could
not see through the aggregation during the birds approach”
L75. What happened to the footage from the other 7 birds? Only 31 out of 38
went foraging?
Reply (L 131-134): Only 31 with valid data. 3 birds did not return and we
suspect these to be non-breeders. 4 birds did not depart the beach in
time, therefore, we recorded 90 minutes of sky. Text amended as
follows:
“We obtained suitable footage from 14 and 17 birds at Bull Roads (BR)
and Cow Bay (CB), respectively, yielding a total of 35.6 hours of footage
while birds were at sea. In the remaining cases, three birds were not
recaptured, and we suspect these to have been non-breeders. The other
four birds were recaptured, but only departed after the cameras had
ceased recording”
L92-93. Rephrase to emphasize small sample size here. “This contrasted
with larger squid and fish, where it was clear that birds pursued prey but
these prey items were rarely ingested (n=8).
Reply (L 152): Thank you. Sentence amended to:
“However, these larger items were seldom encountered (n=8)”
L95 Capitalize “Table” and “Figure” throughout.
Reply: This does not appear to be the standard format used by Royal
Society Open Science.
L97. Can the authors add how many individuals are represented in the “64
separate events”?
Reply (L 156-160): It would be possible to count all the individual lobster
krill in each event. However, this would take an unfeasible amount of
time. The provided video example demonstrates what was meant by an
event and gives an indication of the numerous lobster krill on the
seafloor.
We have amended the text as follows to detail the information more
explicitly:
“Furthermore, for the lobster krill, there were relatively few APCs while
foraging along the seafloor (n = 9), despite clear evidence in 64 separate
events where lobster krill were present on the seafloor. An event was
considered from the moment a bird began swimming over a section of
sea floor containing lobster krill, until the section ended, and each
lasted an average of 2.3 seconds [0.17-31.4s, median/range] (electronic
supplementary material: movie S1)”
Figure 2- caption and figure label should use same language for clarity. X-
axis is percent cover not swarm density? Add explanation of Frequency in
caption. Why is the frequency axis 0-30 and 30-0?
Reply: This figure has been removed
L105 Rephrase to “Using percent coverage as a proxy for swarm density”
Reply: This text has been removed
L109. BR? CB?
Reply: These refer to the two sites where cameras were deployed, and
mention is given in the new methods:
“Thirty-eight birds were sampled from two colonies at the Falkland
Islands, Bull Roads (BR) (52.3096° S, 59.3896° W) and Cow Bay (CB)
(51.4288° S, 57.8703° W),”
L113 Replace “multi” with “two”
Reply (L 176-177): The text has been amended as follows:
“We provide the first evidence of a reduction in foraging success for
penguins attributable to two antipredator tactics utilized by prey; active
defence, and group formation ”
L114-15 This is only a problem when predators consume prey with active
defenses. Many small aggregating prey species eaten by penguins have no
ability to defend themselves.
Reply: Our study, provides evidence about how both prey defence and
prey aggregation may cause caution for marine predator studies
assuming a direct relationship between relative prey availability and
dietary composition.
L121 Replace “is” with “in”
Reply (L 195-196): We edited the sentence further to:
“Disentangling which one, or combination, of these mechanisms may
drive swarming behaviour in lobster krill is challenging”
L123-25. I would argue that communal defense of prey on predators would
be the major factor leading to penguins feeding on the periphery. There are
examples in the literature of penguins swimming through swarms of krill,
which have no defense system. There are other examples in the literature of
penguins working in groups to foraging on schools of fish. There is much
support for penguin foraging on schools and thus, the benefits of foraging on
schooling species. The main difference between krill/fish and lobster krill is
that the lobster krill can actually pinch their predators. It seems like any smart
penguins is not going to want to swim through a school of pinchers.
Reply: Please note, our study provides evidence that gentoo penguins
do not hunt cooperatively and we believe that two main factors may
limit prey up take by these predators; prey defence, and prey
aggregation which may impair birds through the confusion effect and
communal defence. We cannot test explicitly which of these factors is
more likely, hence, we provide arguments for both hypotheses.
We agree, there are examples in the literature of penguins feeding and
benefiting from schooling prey. However, we are showing with the first
in situ observations that multiple factors could warrant caution when
looking at marine predator studies assuming a direct relationship
between relative prey availability and dietary composition
Was a bird more likely to forage on lobster krill later in the foraging trip. I.e. if
they didn't get enough of their preferred food source (fish/squid) then they
would pursue more lobster krill.
Reply: This would be a very interesting question to investigate.
However, without an absolute measurement of prey availability it is
beyond scope of our ability to answer.
As mentioned in L24, can you mention other “species-specific behavioural
adaptations” that allow prey to avoid predation in discussion.
Reply: We feel we addressed this in the discussion. We make note that
in L 193-195:
“aggregating prey can reduce susceptibility to predation through attack
dilution, increased overall vigilance, communal defence and predator
confusion”
We then discuss how various mechanisms are most likely affecting
predation; communal defence and predator confusion.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have used animal-borne video recordings to get detailed
information about the foraging strategies used by penguins. Overall they
show some interesting strategies, concluding that observed predation rates
should not be used to infer prey abundance.
One issue that can’t be avoided by studies like this is the possibility that the
cameras themselves affect feeding behaviour (e.g. due to the substantial
extra drag created).
Reply: We agree. However, we are confident birds were not adversely
affected. Please see the introduced paragraph in the discussion
addressing this concern (L 181-191).
The manuscript is well written and succinct. The guide seems generally very
well written for users to follow, with nice examples and figures, and the
included videos are excellent to watch.
I haven’t tested the R code, but approve of the authors’ use of freely available
tools.
Major issues:
One potentially major technical issue is the method used to analyse prey
clustering densities. The ‘Make Binary’ tool used to threshold the image (in
order to separate prey from background sea) uses adaptive histogram-based
thresholding (e.g. see here: https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/menus/process.html
). Meaning if the prey fill only a small area of the image (e.g. are far away) the
tool will use a different thresholding level to images where the prey take up a
larger area. Below I’ve suggested some alternative (more objective and
repeatable) methods.
Reply: Thank you for providing this information. See further comments
below.
Minor points:
L140-141 Prey-specific capture behaviours do not imply that the predator is
“cognitively aware of the consequences presented by each prey type” at all.
It’s safe to assume that this is an evolved or individually learnt response that
does require any higher form of understanding. e.g. a spider that cuts a wasp
free of its web, while it attacks flies in its web would not be cognitively aware
of the consequences.
Reply (L230-231): Following this comment and that of the editor we
have the amended the sentence as follows:
“This behaviour, and those discussed above, imply that birds can
attend to the specific challenges presented by each prey type”
L61-62 How was prey size determined relative to the bill? There aren’t easy
landmarks to use for this while ensuring the prey are at a fixed distance from
the camera. The guide doesn’t seem to cover this unless I’ve missed it.
Reply (L 107-109): The measurement was done only in relation to the
bill. Based on when prey was directly adjacent to/inside the bill. The text
is amended as follows:
“Prey size was estimated by comparing it to penguin bill size at the
moment the prey was adjacent to the bill. Thus, limiting the effect of
unknown distance which could confound this measurement”
Supplementary Guide:
Concerning using MPEG Streamclip to convert videos to .AVI format, AVI is
simply a container, and doesn’t specify the codec, which in practice is of far
greater importance. Converting from (presumably) h.264 to another codec
could result in frame shifts that disagree with FFMPEG, which is used alter
on. In practice I doubt this is an issue, but it is a little messy.
Reply: Jolyon, you clearly have advance technical insight and it has
been great to learn from your comments. I crashed my machine trying
to find free software to batch convert video files and finally came across
MPEG Streamclip. I have not had any problem with frame shifts. I tried
to develop a method in R that would integrate everything seamlessly
but that was beyond my ability and perhaps a task for a computer
scientist in future. Hopefully a skill that I will develop further too. It will
be great to collaborate with someone in future to try and address this.
Concerning the use of ImageJ, the method used to calculate prey density is
not currently appropriate as I understand it. First, the authors use the “Make
Binary” command, which thresholds the image based on an image histogram
analysis function. This could easily introduce systematic bias and/or eliminate
variance in the dataset as the tool will attempt to make each thresholded
image have a similar overall coverage. Even the example provided suggests
that the thresholding being used is over zealous. Instead, the authors should
use the adaptive background subtraction tool (always using the same
settings), convert to 8-bit, then apply a threshold with a pre-specified
thresholding level which must be the same for the entire study.
Reply: You are correct. Having re-tried the methodology and altering the
threshold settings I see the effect on the image.
We tried your suggested alternate methods, however, had trouble
getting this to work. Perhaps as a product of the image, or perhaps due
to our knowledge of the software.
Please see the included power point: “Response to reviewer JT_Image
analysis”
For now, we have removed this from the paper and supplementary
material.
The discipline of computer vision and image analysis is certainly an
interesting one. I think for some time, those of us dealing with video,
especially in low light marine conditions, will have some challenges.
Hopefully as commercial applications improve we will be able to lean on
these as biologists.
Second, using the wand tool to select the thresholded pixels will miss out
separate clusters, and is not a very repeatable/reliable measure. Instead,
doing something like thresholding the image, then ‘edit>selection>create
selection’ to create an ROI. Next, to include all the internal areas you could
do something like ‘edit>selection>enlarge’ and select e.g. 100px, then repeat
and select -100px (to make the selection smaller again). This will at least be a
more objective way to include slightly separate clusters which is somewhat
robust against the odd individual pixel being out on its own, or lots of internal
spaces (though obviously the same threshold and radius values need to be
used for the entire study).
Finally, an easier route to working out the percentage cover is simply to use
the normal ‘measure’ command, and divide the mean by 2.55 (i.e. 255/100)
to get a percentage (no need to analyse particles).

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Corina Logan):
Dear authors,
Thank you very much for so carefully addressing the previous comments on your
manuscript. I think it was a wise decision to remove the image analysis aspect and to
make this more of a natural history note. This change strengthens and clarifies your
findings.
Your revised manuscript was reviewed by two reviewers and I added comments
(below) as well (please note that my comments refer to line numbers from the
Tracked Changes pdf version of your paper). I am happy to provide a favorable
decision for your manuscript after you revise your manuscript per these comments.
All my best,
Corina Logan
Associate Editor
Corina Logan’s comments
43 - This still isn’t clear; my previous comment still applies: by “third-order selection”
do you mean proxies or indirect evidence of the relationships rather than
investigating the relationships directly? I prefer to avoid jargon to make the ms more
readable to a broad audience. In your example of “ie usage of various habitat
components within the home range”, it isn’t clear how habitat use could provide
indirect evidence for predator-prey interactions. Please rephrase to something like
“have primarily evaluated predator-prey relationships via indirect evidence”.
Please see amendment for added clarity.
FROM: Studies in the marine realm (Torres et al. 2008; Cimino et al. 2016; Carroll et
al. 2017), where sampling of higher trophic order predatory species is often
logistically and financially difficult, have primarily focused on predator-prey
relationships in terms of third-order selection (ie, usage of various habitat
components within the home range) (Johnson 1980)
TO 39-43: Studies in the marine realm which focus on predator-prey relationships [1–
3], face the challenge that simultaneous sampling of both of higher trophic order
predatory species and their prey is often logistically and financially difficult. Thus, a
common approach is to use proxies of prey availability, whereby the level of focus on
predator-prey relationships relates to usage of various habitat components within the
home range (third-order selection, [4])
59 - “fourth-order selection” needs to be explained here as above. It appears that
fourth-order selection is data that were observed at the individual level?
Please see amendment for added clarity.
FROM: This means in situ studies which can provide empirical evidence about the
actual procurement of food items from those available at that site (fourth-order
selection) (Johnson 1980), should greatly enhance our understanding of a predators
foraging ecology.
TO 55-58: This means in situ studies which can provide empirical evidence at the
individual level, about the actual procurement of food items from those available at
that site (fourth-order selection) [4], should greatly enhance our understanding of a
predators foraging ecology
69 - “all species” of penguins? Or all seabird species, or?
This relates to penguin species. Note additional paragraph at the end of the
introduction.
90 - Please list the manufacturer of Roto Stik
We have listed a manufacturer. The details of the original product do not appear to
be online. This kind of marker is readily available from any agricultural business and
is by no means a specialised product.
91 - “facilitated recapture” by making the birds more visible?
The sentence has been amended as follows:
FROM: “During instrument deployment, birds were given a unique mark on the breast
feathers using a green, temporary, waterproof wax marker (ROTO.STIK); this
facilitated recapture.”
TO 96-99: During instrument deployment, birds were given a unique mark on the
breast feathers, to allow for their identification upon return from the sea, using a
green, temporary, waterproof wax marker (ROTO.STIK, Sheepman Supply Co.).
93 - Please change to “bill depth” rather than just “depth” which could be confusing
with water depth. Please also state that you removed the camera.
The sentence has been amended as follows:
FROM: “Upon recapturing, birds were weighed, and bill length and depth recorded.”
TO 99-100: “Upon recapturing, devices were removed, birds were weighed, and bill
length and bill depth recorded”
93 - The word “retrospectively” is confusing - please remove it and say “We later
searched for sampled birds…”
FROM: “We retrospectively identified sampled birds in the colony based on their
unique mark, allowing us to confirm the breeding status”
TO 100-102: “We later searched for sampled birds in the colony based on their
unique mark, allowing us to confirm the breeding status”
125 - Please list the categories of prey sizes that were coded (e.g., smaller than,
larger than, or similar size as the penguin’s bill)
Please note, the results show prey by type and size. E.g. small fish versus larger fish.
Basically, prey was categorised by type then broad size class. Generally speaking,
the birds took a fairly uniform range of prey sizes; at least at the level of detail offered
by the video camera. In future, it may be possible to accurately measure prey size.
The methods are enhanced with an additional sentence:
FROM: Prey size was estimated by comparing it to penguin bill size at the moment
the prey was adjacent to the bill. Thus, limiting the effect of unknown distance which
could confound this measurement.
TO 127-130: Prey size was estimated by comparing it to penguin bill size at the
moment the prey was adjacent to the bill. Thus, limiting the effect of unknown
distance which could confound this measurement. The estimation of prey size
allowed us to categorise prey both by type and broad size class (e.g. small vs large).
133 - “Summarized” is still unclear and I’m not sure what “custom codes” means
either. What did you do with the files in R?
This has now been explicitly stated.
FROM: “We summarised annotated video files with custom codes in R 3.1.2 (R Core
Team 2013) and extracted unique behavioural events (still images) by frame number,
using FFmpeg (Version N-82324-g972b358).”
TO 135-139: “In line with our freeware protocol, we used custom codes in R 3.1.2
[20] to determine, from the annotated video files, the recording duration, number of
APCs and what orientation birds occurred in, and the number of interactions with
conspecifics and heterospecifics. We extracted unique behavioural events (still
images) by frame number, using the freeware FFmpeg (Version N-82324-g972b358)
136 - This paragraph should be removed because it refers to the TDR devices that
are no longer part of this paper. Unless I misunderstood this, in which case, please
state what data you analyzed with diveMove that are presented in this paper.
This paragraph is kept in as both the TDR and GPS data allowed us to accurately
visualise when on a foraging track the footage was derived from. This is made clearer
by now beginning the paragraph as follows:
FROM: Data from TDR devices were processed…
TO Data from TDR and GPS devices were processed as part of the ongoing study,
which, allowed for the visualisation of where along the foraging path footage was
recorded from. Specifically, data from TDR devices were processed with the
‘diveMove’ package [21]. GPS data were first
While the data from the TDR and GPS devices are not examined explicitly in the
paper, they will be forming a valuable contribution in a future paper. Furthermore, the
methods detailed here provide an extremely valuable platform that other investigators
can utilise in future.
Also, at the beginning of the results, we now make reference to where along the
foraging path footage is recorded from.
155 - Does this refer to an analysis that was taken out?
The Electronic Supplementary Material guides readers through the process of
dealing with video data and data from multiple devices. The ESM covers many of the
superfluous details for the interested reader and we hope it provides a valuable
platform that investigators may use or enhance in future.
Methods: you state in the intro that you “develop a widely applicable freeware
protocol”, however it is not apparent where you describe this approach in the
methods. Do you end up developing a protocol in this paper or was this part removed
as well? If it was removed, please remove all references to it. It you kept it in, please
describe it in every section of the paper. If the description is in the supplementary
material, consider moving this to the main paper (or at least the bulk of it).
The methods have been amended throughout to place emphasis on the freeware
approach developed.
NOTE: While we did not develop a new piece of custom software, we did face many
hurdles when beginning to deal with video data. Almost no papers that we reviewed
gave adequate detail of how they dealt with video data. In many instances, most
papers in fact merely provided detail on a specific observation. By emphasising the
steps of the freeware protocol we developed here, we hope to save many new
investigators from the challenges we initially had to deal with.
159 - Please add the range of footage hours per bird in parenthesis in this sentence
to give an indication of the distribution of your data.
Please see the text a few lines on (162-163): “On average, the first 69 (±12.6)
minutes of a trip were recorded and all birds, apart from one, had APCs within the
video recording”
161 - Please clarify why do you suspect these to be non-breeders. Do non-breeders
not return to their exit point or do they stay out for days at a time? Also, add a citation
to support the statement about non-breeding behavior.
Please see the clarification:
FROM: In the remaining cases, three birds were not recaptured, and we suspect
these to have been non-breeders.
TO: In the remaining cases, three birds were not recaptured despite a week of
continuous observation for bird’s post-deployment. Thus, we suspect these to have
been non-breeders as gentoo penguins guarding chicks rarely forage over multiple
days before returning to the nest [18].
162 - Change “departed” to “entered the water”
Thank you. Change confirmed.
167 - It is still unclear what “type” refers to here. Are there different types of APCs? If
so, they should be listed in the methods and summarized here to make it easier for
the reader to follow.
Please see modification which now begins on a new paragraph:
FROM: “An average of 52 [0-284, median/range] and a total of 1932 APCs were
identified for each bird and across all birds, respectively (electronic supplementary
material: movie S1, shows examples of each type)”
TO 164-167: Seven types of APCs were recorded, with an average of 52 [0-284,
median/range] and a total of 1932 individual APCs being identified for each bird and
across all birds, respectively (electronic supplementary material: movie S1, shows
examples of each prey type observed during APCs). The prey involved in different
types of APCs included…
ALSO NOTE: The additional line in the methods (129-130): “The estimation of prey
size allowed us to categorise prey both by type and broad size class (e.g. small vs
large).”
167 - Please change “These were on” to “The prey involved in APCs included”
Thank you. Change confirmed.
168 - I don’t know what a fish standard length is. Will you please add a description for
about how long this is in mm? It appears that you do give mm measurements, in
which case I am unclear what “fish standard length” adds to the sentence. If it does
add something, please clarify what that is. If you do end up clarifying fish standard
length, make sure to add “fish” to “standard length” on line 171.
Please see the additional detail in the text. Fish standard length is the typical
measure used when estimating the length of teleost fish:
FROM: small fish (n = 375, likely juvenile rock cod, either Patagonotothen tessellata
or Patagonotothen ramsayi, <30-40mm fish standard length), larger fish (n = 4,
unidentified, > 70mm standard length)
TO 168-170: small fish (n = 375, likely juvenile rock cod, either Patagonotothen
tessellata or Patagonotothen ramsayi, <30-40mm fish standard length (tip of the
snout to posterior end of the last vertebra)), larger fish (n = 4, unidentified, > 70mm
fish standard length)
177 - Thank you very much for clarifying this paragraph. One additional question that
comes up for me is whether you know that head strike movements are different for
small fish as opposed to medium or large fish? If an ethogram is published on this
topic that makes this distinction, please cite it. Otherwise, if you are relying on
personal observations, please describe the difference and cite yourselves (pers.
obs.).
Thank you for this point. We are currently working on another manuscript that will
have a referenceable ethogram in future.
184 - Please clarify what position and orientation are and how they are distinct from
each other.
We have removed the term position from the text and now only use orientation
throughout.
196 - How are these 5 birds different from the 10 birds in the previous sentence? It
isn’t clear how the krill differed in these two sentences either so please clarify.
These birds are not explicitly different to the others. Rather, the way lobster krill
presented themselves was different and this has now been clarified in the text as
follows:
FROM: There were 29 events, involving 10 different birds, where we observed
lobster krill avoiding capture by defending themselves (figure 2, electronic
supplementary material: movie S2)
TO 193-196: There were 29 events, involving 10 different birds, where we observed
individual lobster krill avoiding capture by actively defending themselves with their
pincers (figure 2, electronic supplementary material: movie S2). Five birds also
encountered lobster krill swarms (n = 44) during their foraging trip.
205 - “cooperatively” is still undefined in the text. Please add a definition (e.g., more
than one penguin foraging on the same krill swarm). The term “cooperative” has
many different meanings in different fields so it is important to state how you are
using the term in this context. This comment also applies to your discussion (lines
256-272)
Thank you for this. Please see the amended text:
FROM: “There was no evidence of birds hunting prey cooperatively, as birds from
both colonies had negligible interactions (percentage of trip time), with both
conspecifics…”
TO 201-203: There was no evidence of birds hunting prey cooperatively (e.g., more
than one penguin foraging on the same prey patch), as birds from both colonies had
negligible interactions (percentage of trip time), with both conspecifics…
218 - Please clarify this paragraph. It looks like the point was to refer to other
literature that indicates that the tags you used likely didn’t influence the behavior of
the penguins and then to provide some anecdotal evidence from your video footage
that this appears to be the case. The first part of the paragraph is confusing because
it looks like you are saying that you looked at tag effects in this study. The second
part of the paragraph needs clarification: why would you expect a non-active prey
pursuit method to indicate the birds were not affected by the tag and how do you
know this is a typical pursuit method if you only have footage from birds with tags on
(and no comparison with birds without tags)? It is possible that their non-active
method was typical because they were wearing the camera.
While we did not explicitly look at tag effects in this study, trial cameras in previous
seasons showed no difference in trip duration (a proxy of foraging effort) between
birds fitted with a camera and those with only a small TDR.
We have clarified the second part of the paragraph by making reference to the diet of
the birds, which is also now introduced in the introduction. Yes, we do not have a
direct comparison for birds while at sea. However, considering that birds were
targeting the same prey as observed in dietary studies we find it unlikely that birds
would alter the method in which they capture this same prey.
FROM: Therefore, we do not expect birds in this study, or their prey capture ability, to
have been largely affected for the following reasons; (a) the typical prey capture
method by gentoo penguins did not involve birds actively pursuing prey, (b) even
when gentoo penguins did actively pursue prey we observed them to be successful
in capturing large squid which required pursuit
TO 219-223: Therefore, we do not expect birds in this study, or their prey capture
ability, to have been largely affected for the following reasons; (a) the typical prey
capture method by gentoo penguins did not involve birds actively pursuing prey; the
same type of prey readily observed in dietary studies [16], (b) even when gentoo
penguins did actively pursue prey we observed them to be successful in capturing
large squid which required pursuit
237 - Replace “this behavior” with “swarming behavior”
The sentence has been amended as follows:
FROM: However, as birds typically targeted individual lobster krill or those on the
periphery of swarms that were not as tightly clustered, this behaviour lends support to
these predators being influenced by communal defence and the confusion effect.
TO 230-233: However, as birds typically targeted individual lobster krill or those on
the periphery of swarms that were not as tightly clustered, this interaction by
penguins to swarms of lobster krill lends support to these predators being influenced
by communal defence and the confusion effect.
275 - Please replace “supporting optimal foraging theory” with “which might indicate
that their behavior is consistent with optimal foraging theory”. You didn’t test optimal
foraging theory as a hypothesis so you can’t say that your evidence supports a
hypothesis you didn’t test.
Thank you. Please see amendment:
FROM: “Birds did, however, actively chase after the eight larger prey items;
supporting optimal foraging theory (Emlen 1966; Macarthur and Pianka 1966)”
TO: Birds did, however, actively chase after the eight larger prey items; which might
indicate that their behaviour is consistent with optimal foraging theory.
275 - Please replace “Thus, it appears” with “Our anecdotes may indicate that” per
the previous comment.
Thank you. Please see amendment:
FROM: “Thus, it appears that penguins will exert a greater amount of energy when
the returns would be higher”
TO 265-267: “Thus, our anecdotes may indicate that penguins will exert a greater
amount of energy when the returns would be higher”
278 - Replace “can attend to” with “may attend to”. You didn’t test (using a
manipulation) what they were attending to so it is important to keep the language
exploratory.
Thank you. Change confirmed.
279 - Replace “be aware of” with “keep track of”. The word “awareness” comes with
all kinds of connotations that are best avoided (e.g., see literature in psychology).
Thank you. Change confirmed.
285 - It is still unclear why you think this population is unique. Do you know that
individuals in this population eat prey species that no other populations eat? It seems
unlikely given that yours is the first direct evidence of what penguins eat in the wild
while on foraging trips. I would remove “potentially unique to” and “owing to their
varied diet across their range”.
Thank you. We have removed those parts of the sentence. It is likely that lobster krill
is quite a unique prey item for gentoo penguins as it only occurs in a few parts of the
species range. Modified sentence follows:
FROM: While our study highlights a predator-prey interaction potentially unique to
gentoo penguins at the Falkland Islands, owing to their varied diet across their range
(Lescroël et al. 2004; Ratcliffe and Trathan 2011), the use of animal-borne camera
loggers provided clear evidence that where there is an abundance of prey, this may
not necessarily be of benefit to the predator
TO 273-275: While our study highlights a predator-prey interaction for gentoo
penguins at only one locality the use of animal-borne camera loggers provided clear
evidence that where there is readily available prey, this may not necessarily be
targeted by the predator
303 - The link to the Dryad repository is broken so I was unable to evaluate the
materials there.
This was unfortunate. We trust the new link will work this time.
Figure 1 - Please label each of the bottom 4 panels with CB or BR so it is clear which
is which.
Labels have been inserted
Figure 2 - Do you mean “The birds in these photos were unsuccessful at capturing
the pictured prey”?
Figure caption amended:
FROM: Figure 2: Lobster krill Munida spp. (a) defensive position - pincers open - as
bird heads toward it. (b) Lobster krill is attacking bird with pincers during an attempted
prey capture (APC). Birds were unsuccessful in capturing prey.
TO: Figure 2: Lobster krill Munida spp. (a) defensive position - pincers open - as bird
heads toward it. (b) Lobster krill is attacking bird with pincers during an attempted prey
capture (APC). In both these instances birds were unsuccessful in capturing the lobster
krill.
Figure 3 - You don’t have evidence of avoidance behavior but rather frequency of
whether they fed at a swarm or not. Please rephrase to something like they fed off of
loosely clustered swarms and not tightly clustered swarms.
Figure caption amended:
FROM: Figure 3: Gentoo penguins were observed to feed off (a) loosely clustered
swarms of lobster krill (n=16), however, the birds avoided feeding from (b) tightly
clustered swarms (n=28).
TO: Figure 3: Gentoo penguins were observed to feed off (a) loosely clustered swarms
of lobster krill (n=16), however, the birds did not feed off (b) tightly clustered swarms
(n=28).
Data at Dryad - because I can’t see what is at Dryad (the link is broken), I relied on
the file Handley_RSOS_Supp_Material_File_Instructions_REVISED.docx. It appears
from this file that only a few of the data files for this study are available at Dryad,
which means that one couldn’t replicate the analysis using the R code because it is
not all available at Dryad. To comply with RSOS’s open data policy
(http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/author-information#Open_data), please upload
all of the data sheets that you analyzed for this paper so that someone can see what

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript describes predator-prey interactions from video loggers. The
manuscript has been simplified from the last version I reviewed and the text is much
clearer. I have just a few comments and questions below.
L52-56. If you are going to specifically talk about the results of a study you need to
make sure what you are saying is correct. 1) GPS devices were not used. Argos
satellite tags and TDRs were used. 2) The study did not try to determine whether
diffuse or dense aggregations influenced vertical segregation. The study used an
AUV to document krill aggregations and their habitat associations within penguin
foraging ranges. Separately, tag data showed spatial and vertical segregation of
foraging habitat between species. Main point<U+2192> Investigators were unable to
determine whether krill aggregation characteristics or species-specific penguin
behaviors drove the vertical segregation between species because krill aggregation
data was not available for every penguin dive.
Thank you for this added clarity. Please see the amendment.
FROM: For example, in a recent study which tracked two penguin species, Adélie
(Pygoscelis adeliae) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins, using GPS devices
and obtained near real-time distribution of prey fields using autonomous underwater
vehicles, investigators were unable to fully determine whether dense or diffuse
aggregations of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) influenced the observed vertical
segregation between the species (Cimino et al. 2016).
TO: For example, a recent study tracked two penguin species (Adélie (Pygoscelis
adeliae) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins) using Argos satellite tags and
time depth recorders, and obtained near real-time distribution of prey fields using
autonomous underwater vehicles. While krill aggregation data was not available for
every penguin dive, investigators were unable to fully determine whether dense or
diffuse aggregations of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), or species-specific
penguin behaviours, drove the observed vertical segregation between penguin
species [2].
L64 delete “diving”
Deleted. Thank you
L69 Replace “sampled” with “tagged”
We prefer the term sampled as it encompasses all aspects that relate to the handling
of the bird, which are further explained in the methods.
L111. Is there anything about prey size in the results?
Yes, the results show prey by type and size. E.g. small fish versus larger fish.
Basically, prey was categorised by type then broad size class. Generally speaking,
the birds took a fairly uniform range of prey sizes; at least at the level of detail offered
by the video camera. In future, it may be possible to accurately measure prey size.
L115 If a bird is far from an aggregation does it look clustered, even though it could
be loosely clustered?
Yes, this could be the case. However, in the context of this study, we considered the
aggregations that birds came into direct contact with. As is shown in the video files
included with the paper.
L135 Did birds at BR and CB have the same behavior, predator-prey dynamics? Did
you test for differences between the two locations?
We know that birds from these colonies feed on different prey items (See: Handley et
al. 2017). We did not formally test for differences between the two colonies in this
manuscript by comparing the type of prey from APCs.
L184 Do you mean active defense of individuals and active defense of a group? It is
unlikely that the group alone is deterring predator, it is mostly likely due to active
defense of many prey grouped together.
We refer to active defence by an individual, as observed in the video footage. Indeed,
there may be an element of active defence by the group. However, we did not
observe this directly.
The sentence has been modified:
FROM: We provide the first evidence of a reduction in foraging success for penguins
attributable to two antipredator tactics utilized by prey; active defence, and group
formation
TO (209-210): We provide the first evidence of a reduction in foraging success for
penguins attributable to two antipredator tactics utilized by prey; active defence by
individuals, and group formation
How harmful is a lobster krill pinch to a penguin? After spending so much time
monitoring the colonies did the authors observe any injuries on the penguins face
etc.?
The question of the lobster krill pinch is an interesting question for a future study. Our
discovery came from the retrospective analysis of the video footage. Therefore, we
did not actively examine penguins faces while in the field.
L227 delete “the”
Thank you. Change confirmed.
L245-48 But are you able to say there is an abundance of prey at the Falkland
Islands compared to all other locations? This needs to be rephrased.
Thank you. The use of the word abundance was perhaps not the best choice. The
sentence has been rephrased and links to the next sentence too, to help clarify the
original query on L250 (query below).
FROM: While our study highlights a predator-prey interaction potentially unique to
gentoo penguins at the Falkland Islands, owing to their varied diet across their range
(Lescroël et al. 2004; Ratcliffe and Trathan 2011), the use of animal-borne camera
loggers provided clear evidence that where there is an abundance of prey, this may
not necessarily be of benefit to the predator. Thus, while Antarctic krill may not be
able to defend themselves like lobster krill, our study provides insight to why there
may be a mismatch between predator and prey distribution observed for gentoo
penguins elsewhere (Cimino et al. 2016)
TO (274-279): While our study highlights a predator-prey interaction for gentoo
penguins at only one locality the use of animal-borne camera loggers provided clear
evidence that where there is readily available prey, this may not necessarily be
targeted by the predator. Hence, while Antarctic krill cannot defend themselves like
lobster krill, our study provides insight to why there may be a mismatch between
predator and prey distribution observed for gentoo penguins elsewhere [2]
L249 replace “may not be able to” with “cannot”
Thank you. Change confirmed.
L250 I do not understand what is being said here, can you clarify? “our study
provides insight to why there may be a mismatch between predator and prey
distribution observed for gentoo penguins elsewhere”
Please see the comment above for query relating to L245-48
Figure 1. Can you make stars larger, it is hard to distinguish?
Stars have been enlarged from 18 to 24 point font
Are there past studies that documented the proportion of prey items in the diet of
gentoos at these colonies? Based on those studies, are the species you see
penguins consume in the video the same? Prey types may change as a function of
distance from shore and you are only documenting the near shore prey so how
representative is predator-prey dynamics described here with what penguins
experience throughout their entire foraging range.
Yes, these studies do exist. Please see the amended introduction:
(68-81) Understanding predator prey interactions ideally requires direct observation,
which is now feasible for penguins owing to advances in animal-borne camera loggers
[15]. The characteristics of gentoo penguin foraging behaviour, specifically the fact that
they undertake relatively short foraging trips, make them a well-suited study species
for camera deployments. Recent dietary studies at the Falkland Islands, based on
stomach content analysis, found that each bird typically feeds consistently during a trip
on the same prey items at a given colony and during a specific breeding period [16,17].
Furthermore, gentoo penguins are primarily diurnal, inshore foragers, seldom travelling
farther than 30km from their breeding colony [18]. Therefore, while video cameras have
limited recording capacity, the footage obtained should offer valuable insight toward
their general foraging behaviours. Thus, the aim of this study was to understand fine
scale predator-prey interactions for gentoo penguins at the Falkland Islands, utilizing
animal-borne camera loggers. Furthermore, we develop a widely applicable, freeware
protocol, scalable across other studies which require detailed annotation and
interpretation of large quantities of video data.
Because you manuscript is short, it seems that some of the supplementary material
can be brought into the main text.
The necessary details are provided in the main text. The content in the
supplementary material serves more as a manual for those users who wish to
undertake similar analyses.
The DOI link for supplementary videos and R code did not work so I was not able to
evaluate these materials
This was unfortunate. We trust the new link will work this time.
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
This paper uses evidence from video loggers to assess predator-prey interactions,
with an emphasis on describing prey-mediated changes in behavior of a predator. It
is an admirable bit of work, no doubt challenging to collect in the field and collate for
analysis. Having deployed cameras on this and other species recently, I appreciate
the effort. Based on my own (limited) experience with video-derived data, I think the
methods are efficient, well-aimed, and will be useful for future studies to learn from. I
also recognize this is a revised manuscript and note the authors’ work to address
prior concerns and recommendations. Nonetheless, I do have two main comments
that I would encourage the authors to address in an additional revision.
First, the paper suffers from both brevity and excess that limits its clarity and impact. I
would urge the authors to spend time adding detail and specificity to the text, while at
the same time eliminating unnecessary methods. I have tried to offer specific
examples of where such focus would be helpful in specific comments, below.
Thank you for the examples. We have endeavoured to incorporate these suggestions
where necessary.
Second, and perhaps most importantly, on lines 168-175 are found the results
around which the paper is fully framed. Yet there are no descriptions here of the anti-
predator behaviors that lobster krill used to defend themselves individually and only
brief mention of tight versus loose clustering that appears to be related to predation
attempts. And what about the behavior of other prey items encountered – can you
include more here about fleeing fish and squids – was that active defense effective?
In general, I think more attention to these anti-predator observations, specific
reference to additional images that solidify the importance of such behaviors, and the
presence (of lack of) obvious anti-predator behavior among the suite of prey
encountered by the gentoo penguins is critical to include given the main goal of the
paper to advocate for considering how prey behaviors modify predation.
Yes, these results do play an integral role in the paper. We do believe they are
discussed in light of the other results. I.e. the orientation through which birds attacked
prey, the fact that birds were always foraging alone and the manner in which prey
were pursued.
Regarding the individual defence by lobster krill, we have amended the fourth
paragraph of the discussion to begin as follows (thus highlighting the role of
individual lobster krill attacks):
“Regarding communal defence; while we could not observe this directly from the
video footage, the attacks observed from individual lobster krill mean that it is likely
each swarm constitute multiple lobster krill defending themselves from attack.
Therefore, birds must consider the trade-off between the short-term gain in energy
versus the possible long-term reduction in foraging efficiency should the bird become
injured. For many species, where …”
For the other large prey items. We only observed 4 APCs on larger fish and likely
adult squid, respectively. Thus, limiting our ability to offer reliable insight about these
interactions. The juvenile fish, which also formed a large part of the observations,
offered no observable defensive mechanisms. Nor, did the two unidentified prey
items.
While additional images might be appropriate. Our experience with the video data is
that in nearly all cases it is extremely difficult to capture a still frame that reveals the
full scope of what is happening. Rather, video snippets offer much greater insight and
these are available in the paper for every type of prey interaction that we observed.
Abstract
Line 30: Consider including a bit of “how” to this sentence. For example, perhaps
something along these lines: “The video evidence demonstrates that aggressive
behavioral defense mechanisms of prey influence prey capture by a seabird by
deterring predation attempts altogether or reducing the success of predation attempts
.”
Thank you for enhancing the sentence. Please see change:
FROM: We show, for the first time, that aggressive behavioural defence mechanisms
by prey can influence prey capture by a seabird
TO (27-28): From the video evidence, we show, for the first time, that aggressive
behavioural defence mechanisms by prey can deter prey capture by a seabird
Line 34-36: Again, a bit of “how” is missing here. How is trophic coupling significantly
influenced? I think a more useful conclusion based on the video evidence is that
prey behavior affects predator foraging success and that this is important to consider
when characterizing predator-prey relationships through the lens of traditional diet
studies.
Thank you:
FROM: In conclusion, we show that prey behaviour can significantly influence trophic
coupling in marine systems and should be accounted for in studies using marine top
predators as samplers of mid to lower trophic level species
TO (31-35): In conclusion, we show that prey behaviour can significantly influence
trophic coupling in marine systems because despite prey being present, it is not
always targeted. Thus, these predator-prey relationships should be accounted for in
studies using marine top predators as samplers of mid to lower trophic level species
Introduction
Line 40-43: This opening sentence is vague and lacks pop to draw in a reader. What
kind of “studies” are you refereeing to? What kind of “sampling” do you mean? Be
precise and specific to help introduce the study to follow.
Thank you for aiding the opening the sentence. Please see change:
FROM: Studies in the marine realm (Torres et al. 2008; Cimino et al. 2016; Carroll et
al. 2017), where sampling of higher trophic order predatory species is often
logistically and financially difficult, have primarily focused on predator-prey
relationships in terms of third-order selection (ie, usage of various habitat
components within the home range) (Johnson 1980)
TO: Studies in the marine realm which focus on predator-prey relationships [1–3],
face the challenge that simultaneous sampling of both of higher trophic order
predatory species and their prey is often logistically and financially difficult. Thus, a
common approach is to use proxies of prey availability, whereby the level of focus on
predator-prey relationships relates to usage of various habitat components within the
home range (third-order selection, [4]).
Line 53-55: Consider editing this to read: Here we demonstrate how in situ studies
can provide direct evidence about...of food items available while foraging and how
such data can improve our …Consider making it 2 sentences, as well.
Thank you. We have refrained from making this change and edited the sentence
following comments from the editor.
FROM: This means in situ studies which can provide empirical evidence about the
actual procurement of food items from those available at that site (fourth-order
selection) (Johnson 1980), should greatly enhance our understanding of a predators
foraging ecology.
TO (55-58): This means in situ studies which can provide empirical evidence at the
individual level, about the actual procurement of food items from those available at
that site (fourth-order selection) [4], should greatly enhance our understanding of a
predators foraging ecology
Line 62-63: This sentence is unclear. How “what” may hold? Do you mean the
degree to which prey mediate predator behavior and how interactions change with
different prey types?
The sentence has been clarified:
FROM: … there is a pressing need to identify the degree to which this may hold
across all species, and under differing prey regimes
TO (65-67): Therefore, there is a pressing need to better understand behavioural
interactions between seabirds and their prey and the role they might play as marine
samplers.
M&M
Throughout – consider replacing “annotated for” with “recorded”.
Thank you. These have been amended
Line 107 – delete “or not”
We feel that including the part of the sentence “or not” makes it explicit the bird may
or may not have been successful during an attempted prey capture.
TO (123): It was not always feasible to determine if prey were consumed or not.
Line 108 – Can the definition of APC be simplified to include only the first part
regarding actively moving the head toward a prey item. I do not understand how the
attempt to capture the prey requires the rest of the definition.
No. Future work will be based on this definition also. The typical behaviour of birds
was to strike the head toward prey and pursue prey with the head (and clearly body).
For attempted prey captures that lasted longer, this could be annotated for by noting
the time between: “a bird actively raising and striking its head toward the prey item
until the moment its head returned to a neutral position, after the bird may have either
been successful in capturing the item or not”
Line 121-133 – I felt like this entire paragraph could be deleted with zero impact on
rest of the paper, as there is no presentation in the results that requires these
analyses. If retained, convince the reader that some output of diveMove and crawl
was essential to the data your present in the paper.
This paragraph is kept in as both the TDR and GPS data allowed us to accurately
visualise when on a foraging track the footage was derived from. This is made clearer
by now beginning the paragraph as follows:
FROM: “Data from TDR devices were processed…”
TO (140-142…): “Data from TDR and GPS devices were processed as part of the
ongoing study, which, allowed for the visualisation of where along the foraging path
footage was recorded from. Specifically, data from TDR devices…”
While the data from the TDR and GPS devices are not examined explicitly in the
paper, they will be forming a valuable contribution in a future paper. Furthermore, the
methods detailed here provide an extremely valuable platform that other investigators
can utilise or hopefully develop in future.
Results
Line 146- check if this number should be 88 (or 78, I think).
(172) Thank you. Change confirmed.
Line 154 –just to clarify, but are the 109 missed prey included in the total APC tally?
Yes, they are included.
Line 157 – consider starting a new paragraph here.
Thank you. New paragraph started.
Line 159 – presumably you have depth data from the dive logger to more accurately
describe the depth distribution of APCs, particularly those instances in the water
column? I think it is useful to include such depth data, as it is clear from the video that
you have both demersal and “pelagic” feeding.
We did consider including this data, but this will form an important component of
another manuscript. As this manuscript focuses on the actual procurement of prey
items we prefer to leave the depth data for the future manuscript.
Discission
Line 188 -198. Consider moving this to the end of the discussion and focus here on
the main results.
(215-226) We realise the placement of this section tends to vary across papers.
However, our preference is to keep it in the beginning of the discussion.
Line 206. Consider “The confusion effect arises when prey behavior limits the ability
of a predator …..items from tightly packed groups and presents a …”
Thank you for enhancing this sentence.
FROM: The confusion effect, is when prey behaviour makes it harder for predators to
single out prey items when they are tightly packed and present a greater visual
barrier; as has been documented for a variety of predators such as invertebrates, fish
and other birds (Parrish 1993; Jeschke and Tollrian 2007)
TO (234-237): The confusion effect arises when prey behaviour limits the ability of a
predator to single out prey items from tightly packed groups which present a greater
visual barrier; as has been documented for a variety of predators such as
invertebrates, fish and other birds [39,40].
Line 251-255 –Again, there is a lack of clarity in this closing that limits the impact of
the study. What caution must be taken? Can you provide clarity on how to consider
the mechanisms of prey-predator interactions? The point that relationships between
prey and predators can be complicated by behavior and that naïve assumptions
about such behaviors may cloud our inference is useful, but I think you need to lean
on specific observations from your study to strengthen your conclusions.
Thank you for this point. We have amended the closing as follows:
FROM: The implications of our study are that consideration must be given to the
mechanisms through which predator and prey interact, and that caution must be
taken against over simplifying trophic studies involving marine top predators. By not
taking caution, we may arrive at naïve conclusions when relating demographic
parameters or distribution, as well dietary composition of predators, to the availability
and abundance of prey (Piatt et al. 2007; Durant et al. 2009; Fauchald 2009).
TO: The implications of our study are that considerations such as the ability of prey to
avoid predation, and the degree to which predator and prey interact when in relatively
close proximity, must be considered when characterising dynamic marine systems.
Thus, caution must be taken against over simplifying trophic studies involving marine
top predators because we may arrive at naïve conclusions when relating demographic
parameters or distribution, as well dietary composition of predators, to the availability
and abundance of prey [5,6,14].

Dear Corina Logan,
Thank you for assisting with the Research Article entitled
“Behaviourally mediated predation avoidance in penguin prey: In
situ evidence from animal-borne camera loggers” for consideration
by your journal.
We have revised the paper as per your suggestions.
Our article provides the first in situ evidence for a marine case study, of
how multiple behaviours by prey can influence predator foraging
success for a seabird. We achieved this by using a scalable biologging
approach and developing a widely applicable methodology for any user
studying marine organisms with animal-borne camera loggers.
The key implication of our study is that prey behaviour can significantly
influence trophic coupling in marine systems and should be accounted
for in studies using marine top predators as samplers of mid to lower
trophic level species.
The article enhances our understanding of marine ecology and holds
wide applicability to academics, resource managers and ecological
modellers. Furthermore, the study provides valuable material for
educators and science communicators.
We also provide a detailed outline of our approach in an electronic
supplementary material, which directs user to necessary software (all
freeware) and R code.
All authors (Jonathan M Handley, Andréa Thiebault, Andrew Stanworth,
David Schutt, Pierre Pistorius) have agreed to be listed and approved
the submitted version of the manuscript.
Thank you for your consideration and assistance with this manuscript.
Sincerely,
Jonathan Handley

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Corina Logan):
Dear authors,
Many thanks for your very clear tracking of changes in the PDF - that was really
helpful. Thank you also for addressing all of the additional comments. I reviewed the
revision and your responses to the comments, and there are five points (below) that
would be good to clarify when submitting the final version. Once these changes have
been made, I am happy to accept this manuscript on behalf
of Royal Society Open Science. I look forward to seeing it online.
All my best,
Corina Logan
Associate Editor
73 - Please clarify what “marine samplers” means
L 65-71: Furthermore, penguins have been deemed sentinels of the marine
environment [13], with various seabird associated proxies, such as behavioural and
demographic measurements, potentially indicating the state of the marine environment
[5,6,14], Therefore, there is a pressing need to better understand behavioural
interactions between seabirds and their prey, and the role these upper trophic level
predators might play as samplers of mid to lower trophic level species.
180 - Please clarify whether APC “type” refers to the different types of prey involved
in APCs or whether there are 7 different types of movements the penguins engage in
when in an APC. It looks like “type” refers to different types of prey, in which case,
please reword from “Seven types of APCs were recorded” to “APCs involved foraging
on seven different prey types”, and on line 183 change from “The prey involved in
different types of APCs included” to “The seven types of prey involved in the APCs
included”
Many thanks for this comment. Please see amendment:
L 172-177: Attempted prey captures involved foraging on seven different prey types,
with an average of 52 [0-284, median/range] and a total of 1932 individual APCs
being identified for each bird and across all birds, respectively (electronic
supplementary material: movie S1, shows examples of each prey type observed
during APCs). The seven types of prey involved in the APCs included lobster-krill
Results: in your response you state “Also, at the beginning of the results, we now
make reference to where along the foraging path footage is recorded from”, however,
I couldn’t find a mention of this in the revised paper. Please make sure to include this
in the results section.
Apologies, this was excluded in the revised version. However, the comment was
made in the corrected version of the manuscript previously uploaded. Please see
below:
L164-166: We obtained suitable footage from 14 and 17 birds at Bull Roads (BR) and
Cow Bay (CB), respectively, yielding a total of 35.6 hours of footage which was
recorded from the begging of foraging trips (figure 1).
231 - Please add a sentence to the beginning of this paragraph stating the main point
for how it relates to your study. I interpret this to be something along the lines of
“While we did not measure the effects of tags on the behavior on the individuals in
our study, we expect tag effects to be negligible for the following reasons.”
We did not think the sentence fitted at the beginning of the paragraph, instead we
incorporate it into the paragraph as follows:
L225-238: A key consideration in biologging studies is tag affect. For penguins, there
are mixed results regarding the degree to which birds are affected, either neutrally or
negatively [34–36]. Based on wind tunnel tests looking at drag on various species, it is
clear that numerous aspects should be considered when looking at the effect of a tag
on a diving marine predator, such as tag cross sectional area, average swimming
speed, prey capture methods and duration of tag deployment [37,38]. Therefore, while
we did not measure the effects of tags on the behaviour of the individuals in our study
directly, we expect tag effects on the birds, and their prey capture ability, to be
negligible for the following reasons we do not expect birds in this study, or their prey
capture ability, to have been largely affected for the following reasons; (a) the typical
prey capture method by gentoo penguins did not involve birds actively pursuing prey;
the same type of prey readily observed in dietary studies [16], (b) even when gentoo
penguins did actively pursue prey we observed them to be successful in capturing
large squid which required pursuit, and (c) tags were only deployed for a single foraging
trip, thereby minimising possible long-term effects on fitness.
Data at Dryad
1) I was able to access the link for review, thanks for adding this. I saw data files with
BR in the title and BR in the data, but no data for CB. Is the CB data at Dryad as
well? If so, please label it. If not, please add it.
Yes, the CB data is at Dryad also, within the .Rdata file. There are two key files at
Dryad to reproduce the results presented. These are detailed in the supplementary
