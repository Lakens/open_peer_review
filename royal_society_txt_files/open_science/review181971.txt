Authors report seedless synthesis of gold nanostars of 60 nm size and their application in
biosensing. Typically they have used ascorbic acid reduction of gold salt in acidic medium in
presence of Ag ion. Advantage and appropriateness of synthetic condition need to be
varified/compared with various control conditions. In particular sequence of addition of various
reagents and their consequence in optical property, particle size and quality of nanostars should
be studied. Glucose detection approach via formation Ag form hydrogen peroxide, is interesting.
The language is too difficult to follow.

The authors (Phiri et al.) present an adapted technique for synthesis of gold nanostars (AuNS) to
provide more control and stability than the recent HEPES method, through use of silver ions and
citrate as the reductant. The nanoparticles produced are well characterised and applied in a silver
deposition assay for glucose sensing.
The work seems novel, and sound and I have a only a few small comments for the authors:
1) It would be good to see the DLS intensity data curves plotted out in the paper or SI, rather than
just the numbers, to get a better idea of the quality of fit and make it easier for the reader. The
way the data is currently provided is hard to use.

2) In Figures 2 and 6, whilst the TEM is nice, the scalebars should be made clearer.
3) On p5 line 10, is there any sensitivity of this new method at all to the addition time of the Ag,
or is the Ag the reaction initiator? (How immediate is “immediate addition of AuNS” to get good
AuNS?)
4) Why was 0.3 M of NaCl used as the salt stability test concentration? Do the authors have a feel
for that the upper limit of stability to salt and pH might be?
5) Typo on P7 line 45 “In the absence of glucose, the seedless AuNSs remained star shaped and
progressively became more spherical as the glucose concentration was increased.” This seems to
conflate two different processes – absence = star shape, presence = AuNS become spherical?
6) Is Figure 6a normalised? If so, please state in the caption.
7) Suggested references to include on similar or related, rapid routes to AuNS and theory on their
growth mechanisms:

Response to Referees
Referee 1
<U+F0B7> Advantage and appropriateness of synthetic condition need to be verified/compared with
various control conditions. In particular sequence of addition of various reagents and their
consequence in optical property, particle size and quality of nanostars should be studied.
Response: It was experimentally observed that even when HCl was not added in the synthesis
procedure, gold nanostars were still formed. However, the localised surfaced plasmon resonance
of these nanostars were more blue-shifted compared to those synthesised with HCl added to it.
This corresponds to what Yuan et al also discovered in their investigation of the effect of pH on the
nanostars formation [1]. They further investigated the effect of lowering the pH by substituting HCl
with nitric acid. They observed that the nanostars were not formed at all. This led to the postulation
that the Cl- ions could be involved in the formation of the gold nanostars. The effects of addition or
omission of HCl on the size of the nanostars were not studied in this manuscript. Other studies
using the ascorbic acid silver-assisted nanostars recipes adequately report the experimental
effects of the various combinations of ascorbic acid in relation to the HAuCl 4, as well as adding
varying quantities of silver nitrate to the mixture [1-3]. Thus, we opted to mostly focus on the
removal of the gold seeds and strategically changing the order of the addition of the reagents.
<U+F0B7> Glucose detection approach via formation Ag form hydrogen peroxide, is interesting. The
language is too difficult to follow.
Response: The language here was revised and simplified so as to make it easy to follow. It now
reads as follows as quoted exactly from the manuscript:
Using optimized conditions, this assay system was investigated for the determination of
various concentrations of glucose as a proof of concept. As shown in Figure 6a, the LSPR
shifted when the glucose concentration was increased from 1.25 to 8.75 mM. This
demonstrated the strong dependence of the LSPR shift on the concentration of glucose. The
insert in Figure 6c shows the colors corresponding to the LSPR shifts. The solutions changed
color from blue in the control sample, to purple and finally to different intensities of orange.
This showed the potential of the nanosensors to be applied in assays with both UV-vis
spectrophometric- and naked-eye readouts. The scatter plot of the glucose concentration
verses the inverse of the OD max is presented in Figure 6b. This suggests a predicable
quantifiable relationship of the nanosensors to potentially distinguish between different
concentrations of an analyte. The TEM images (Figure 6c) show the morphological changes
that occurred during the reaction. In the absence of glucose, the nanostructures remained
star-shaped. Conversely, when the glucose was added to various tubes in increasing
concentrations, the AuNS progressively became more spherical in shape. The change in
morphology from star to spherical could be attributed to an increase in silver coating on the
surface of the nanostars, as illustrated in Scheme 1. To validate the assumption that the
change in size was due to increased silver coating, two representative samples (I and III) were
analyzed for elemental composition. As expected, sample I consisted of Au only while sample
III contained a significant amount of silver. The analysis proved the assumption that silver was
responsible for the growth or change in morphology of the AuNSs. Therefore, this
demonstrated that the nanostars when properly functionalized with enzymes could be
conveniently used to detect different amounts of analytes of interest.

1) It would be good to see the DLS intensity data curves plotted out in the paper or SI, rather
than just the numbers, to get a better idea of the quality of fit and make it easier for the
reader. The way the data is currently provided is hard to use.
This was done and now added to Figure 3.
2) In Figures 2 and 6, whilst the TEM is nice, the scalebars should be made clearer.
The images were reworked and the scalebars are now clearer.
3) On p5 line 10, is there any sensitivity of this new method at all to the addition time of the Ag,
or is the Ag the reaction initiator? (How immediate is “immediate addition of AuNS” to get
good AuNS?)
The time for the addition of AgNO3 was observed to be very important in this method. In the
experimental protocol, AgNO3, was added about 10 seconds after the addition of HAuCl 4. This
led to star formation. On the other hand, prolonged delay of over 30 seconds in the addition of
AgNO3 led to the formation of other nanoshapes with a distinctive pink/light purple coloured
solution.
4) Why was 0.3 M of NaCl used as the salt stability test concentration? Do the authors have a
feel for that the upper limit of stability to salt and pH might be?
Application of protein-modified gold nanostars in physiological pH and ionic environment
requires that they are stable in solutions containing high concentration of proteins and salts.
Thus, the stability of the GOx-modified seedless-AuNSs was tested and proved in 0.3 M NaCl
and pH 7 [4, 5]. 0.3 M NaCl is deemed to be twice the ionic concentration of salt in plasma
which is 0.135 M [6]. Therefore, this concentration has been in the cited publication to test the
stability of the nanoparticles in ionic environment [4]. A critical flocculation concentration is
usually determined as the threshold concentration of NaCl in the gold solution which causes
rapid aggregation [5]. However, this was not done for the submitted manuscript.
5) Typo on P7 line 45 “In the absence of glucose, the seedless AuNSs remained star shaped
and progressively became more spherical as the glucose concentration was increased.” This
seems to conflate two different processes – absence = star shape, presence = AuNS
become spherical?
The line was revised and now reads as follows:
“In the absence of glucose, the nanostructures remained star-shaped. Conversely, when the
glucose was added to various tubes in increasing concentrations, the AuNS progressively
became more spherical in shape.”
6) Is Figure 6a normalised? If so, please state in the caption.
Yes. Figure 6a was normalized and has since been stated in the caption.
7) Suggested references to include on similar or related, rapid routes to AuNS and theory on
their growth mechanisms:
a. 10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b03242
b. 10.1039/C3RA44842H
c. 10.1002/adma.201605622
The suggested references were reviewed and appropriately included in the manuscript. The
suggestions are much appreciated as they threw some light on the subject matter.
