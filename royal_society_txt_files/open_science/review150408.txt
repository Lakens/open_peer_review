Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The authors have tried to tackle an interesting hypothesis, but there are some flaws (choice of the
isocaloric diets, experimental set-up, potential bias due to parasites, …) that make it difficult to
sustain the straight-forward conclusions the authors are making. The data can be interesting
anyhow, but the authors will have to redraft the paper towards much more careful
considerations, and remove speculations from the discussion. To my opinion, there is not enough
solid evidence to make the statement that protein maintenance requirements are not covering
enough for immunity, but they might make an addition to science by describing the impact of
immunity on nitrogen balance in pigeons. Researchers such as Kirk Klasing in UC Davis have
already done much work on the nutritional cost of immunity in birds, so the authors might need
to check how their data still add to existing knowledge.
24 & title: I am not sure that you can make that conclusion, since a decreased response is not
necessarily insufficient. You can however state that immune response responds to dietary protein
above requirement.

216: The weight loss when putting the birds in the metabolism cages is a typical event that is
difficult to avoid, but it does affect the nitrogen balance: mobilised tissue will have added to
229-231: What the authors measure is apparent N retention, so it is not surprising that this
decreases with lower dietary protein because the basal loss of endogenous N is proportionally
higher within the total N loss when dietary protein goes down. This is why for instance
“standardised” ileal digestible amino acids are used in practical pig nutrition.
279-281: The authors try to turn this event into an opportunity, which is nice, but they should be
able to demonstrate that the parasites were not already present from the start of the experiment,
because that would mean that the conclusions about dietary protein levels would be biased by
the presence of the parasites. The statement at line 381 is not very strong at the defence. It is also
questionable if Exp 1 then really determined “normal” MNR since it is unknown if these pigeons
had parasites or not.
294: the discussion is pretty long and might benefit from some cutting so that the central message
is better emphasised. In general, the discussion contains many hypotheses on underlying
mechanisms that have not been investigated, and therefore tend to be speculative. The authors
should reduce that.
307-308: I do not agree here: every measure has a standard deviation. If the authors want to make
the statement that protein provision should have been higher than based on MNR measurements,
than this should have been statistically evaluated (not by number such as 2 out of 5).
398-400: can be, but other studies demonstrate that gastrointestinal parasites can affect nutrient
balances (and voluntary feed intake).
415: is that not contradicting the statement about lack of N due to immune reaction ?
428-429: I don’t think you can measure “N status” with these parameters, since it is also normal to
have amino acid catabolism for energy production in many species, and does not necessarily
need to point to negative N balance. With stable isotopes, you might indeed find out if more of
the N is spent for immunity.
645: the authors should acknowledge somewhere that they cannot fully claim protein effects since
a decrease in protein coincides with an increase in starch and vice versa. Only if they would have
included diets where protein was exchanged with fat as well, they could have made statements
on protein effects.

Figures in the tables have too many decimals.
Figure 3: I don’t know of this theory with stable and unstable negative N balance, but is seems
unconventional and not fully supported by the data, so it might need some more clarification if
this is something established or part of the authors' hypothesis.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have tried to tackle an interesting hypothesis, but there are some flaws (choice
of the isocaloric diets, experimental set-up, potential bias due to parasites, …) that make it
difficult to sustain the straight-forward conclusions the authors are making.
We used isoenergetic (isocaloric) diets because energy intakes, both high
and low (relative to requirements), have been shown to influence nitrogen
balance (e.g. Monroe 1978, Young 1986). To use diets that are not
isoenergetic would create considerable problems in feed formulation in
order to ensure that intakes of nutrients other than protein would be similar
across diets. Protein and carbohydrates have similar energy values so that
substitution of the protein source with a carbohydrate does not significantly
alter energy content of the diet: this is a well-recognised experimental
technique used in many species of animals including pigs (e.g. van Heugten
et al. 1994). Resistant starches and non-starch polysaccharides have been
shown to influence the immune system (Bao and Choct, 2010) and there is no
evidence that corn (maize) or wheat starch do so. Substituting protein for fat
could also cause nutritional problems because fatty acids can influence
immune function (e.g. Kidd 2004) and their effects differ depending on
whether they are for example n-6 (omega 6) or n-3 (omega 3) fatty acids
(Korver and Klasing, 1997).

*** I certainly do not argue the fact that isoenergetic diets were used, but the fact that the choice of
the substitution might have affected the outcomes. See further below. ***
We do not respond specifically to the broad comment that there is a flaw in
the experimental set up because there are no details have been given about
what aspect of the design is flawed.
*** I was referring her to my comments further down on for instance the choice of the diets.***
The aim of Experiment 1, the nitrogen balance experiment, was to determine
whether the diets to be used in the study of protein intakes on immune
function provided sufficient nitrogen to maintain nitrogen balance and to
determine whether a dietary protein concentration of 6%, which is similar to
that calculated from Figure 6.5 in Klasing (1998) for maintenance of protein
requirements, would be adequate.
The wording in the Abstract and Introduction has been changed to clarify
this.
The presence of intestinal parasites causing a potential bias was discussed
however we have inserted additional discussion and references to clarify and
justify our use of the data despite the presence of parasites in some of the
pigeons.

*** Thanks for this elaborate answer. The above was mainly my general appreciation of the
manuscript. My specific comments were listed below. Sorry if that was not clear. ***
The data can be interesting anyhow, but the authors will have to redraft the paper towards
much more careful considerations, and remove speculations from the discussion.
We have considered the reviewers comment and have made minor changes to
the manuscript however we believe that a discussion can contain some
speculation and have therefore not made sweeping changes.
*** Ok, I will check. ***
To my opinion, there is not enough solid evidence to make the statement that protein
maintenance requirements are not covering enough for immunity, but they might make an
addition to science by describing the impact of immunity on nitrogen balance in pigeons.
7
The design of the experiment does not allow us to determine the impact of
immunity on nitrogen balance. The treatments applied to the pigeons would
have to be completely different to do what the reviewer suggests. In order to
measure what the reviewer suggests it would be necessary for the treatments
to cause a non-dietary change in the functioning of the immune system by the
application of immunological stressors e.g. inoculation of the pigeons or
exposure to pathogens and then to measure nitrogen balance in those birds.
Nitrogen balance of pigeons kept in the metabolism cages would then
indicate an increase or decrease in protein requirement as a result of a
change in immune system activity: another possibility would be to use
isotopes of nitrogen to determine protein turnover in the pigeons. We have
not made any changes to the manuscript with respect to this comment.
The response however may not be easy to interpret as Klasing and Barnes
(1988) showed that methionine requirement decreased in growing chicks
because immunological stress decreased growth rate.
*** I don’t really agree on this one: nutritional demands for the immune system can differ even if
not experimentally challenged. Intact proteins themselves can already alter immunoglobulin
titers and cytokines. I agree that the authors demonstrated that there is a change in the
immunological profile of the pigeons, but I disagree that this demonstrates insufficiency. ***
Klasing K C, Barnes DM. 1988 Decreased amino acid requirements of
growing chicks due to immunologic stress. J Nutr. 118, 1158–1164.
Researchers such as Kirk Klasing in UC Davis have already done much work on the nutritional
cost of immunity in birds, so the authors might need to check how their data still add to
existing knowledge.
We are familiar with the research work of Kirk Klasing and his excellent
work and reviews on nutrition and immunity. However he has not carried out
research on protein and immunity in pigeons and as far as we can ascertain
nor have others.
*** That is correct, but then the authors might need to explain better why it is important to have
this work done in pigeons. Which general scientific insights have been gained here ? Or is the
only addition to science that it has now been demonstrated in pigeons ? ***
We have listed in the introduction a number of references on the effects of
protein intakes on immune function in a number of species from insects to
humans. There are none in domestic pigeons and there are not many
references for birds other than domestic birds.
We therefore believe that the pigeon data is new and also that it adds to
existing knowledge on the effects of protein intakes on innate and acquired
immune functions.
*** So please be more specific on this in the discussion. ***
We did not measure protein costs of an immune response, which Klasing
(2004 quoted by Hasselquist and Nilson 2012) calculated from the turnover
of lysine as less than 7% of total protein required in growing chicks. A value
for the cost of immune responses would depend on the type of immune
response elicited or measured (Kogut and Klasing 2009), whether the bird
was growing or not and how protein (in effect amino acids) was being
portioned in the body.

24 & title: I am not sure that you can make that conclusion, since a decreased response is
not necessarily insufficient. You can however state that immune response responds to
dietary protein above requirement.
*** I agree that this is not necessary here, and might need too many assumptions.***
Our data show that antibody production in pigeons given the 6 and 10%
protein diets is significantly reduced compared to those given the 14%
protein diet. A decrease in antibody production in response to NDV
inoculation could increase the risk of Newcastle disease developing on
exposure to the virus. And thus immunity is not adequately sustained.
However we have slightly changed the wording in the last sentence of the
abstract.
We have changed the title to
Functions of innate and acquired immune system are reduced in domestic
pigeons (Columba livia domestica) given a low protein diet.

pigeons to resist disease, but I can live with that. ***

A loss in body weight does not necessarily indicate nor is it necessarily
proportional to nitrogen loss. Changes in body weight may be due to changes
in water, fat or nitrogen content. During natural periods of starvation in e.g.
penguins, rate of loss of fat is much more rapid than that of protein (e.g.
Groscolas and Robin 2001).

*** Yes, I agree that fat mobilization usually occurs at a faster rate than lean mass mobilization
(water and protein), but all DO occur and commonly show a linear relationship, meaning that the
authors should again acknowledge that the negative balance in their study might have affected
the results. ***
The validity of nitrogen balance and regression analysis for determining
9
requirements has been discussed in detail by others (e.g. Hegsted 1976,
Young 1986, Manatt and Garcia 1992, Murphy 1993) and we know of the
inherent problems with the methodology that can contribute to an over or
under estimation of requirements. However, it is a relatively cheap noninvasive
method and for species for which no other data are available it
provides a relatively cheap and non-invasive estimation on which further
work can be based.

*** Indeed, I can understand that a cheap method was used, but a correct interpretation is then
crucial to provide readers with accurate information, so the downsides of the applied method
need to be discussed. This does not reduce the value of the manuscript, but makes it stronger. ***
229-231: What the authors measure is apparent N retention, so it is not surprising that this
decreases with lower dietary protein because the basal loss of endogenous N is
proportionally higher within the total N loss when dietary protein goes down. This is why for
instance “standardised” ileal digestible amino acids are used in practical pig nutrition.
The experiment was not designed to determine digestibility of soy protein
amino acids in pigeons.
Measuring concentrations of amino acids in the ileum and comparing them
with the concentrations in ingested feed give a measure of digestibility
(amount absorbed or assimilated) before digesta reaches the caecum. The
caecum contains micro-organisms capable of synthesising amino acids from
non-protein nitrogen.
Pigeons have only vestigial caeca so synthesis of large quantities of amino
acids by bacteria is unlikely to occur.
*** I’m sorry if my comment was not clear enough: even if you look at ileal digestibility, there are
basal endogenous losses, coming from for instance secreted digestive juices and desquamated
intestinal cells. Please look at the explanation of the concept of “standardized digestibility” in pig
nutrition. Especially in birds, these losses can be high, and not negligible. When you feed a low
protein level, the basal endogenous losses might be the same in absolute terms, but will take a
much higher proportion of the excreted nitrogen, even if the true digestibility is the same, hence
rendering a lower figure for apparent digestibility and retention. Therefore, the authors cannot
claim that there was lower N retention with lower dietary protein. ***
279-281: The authors try to turn this event into an opportunity, which is nice, but they
should be able to demonstrate that the parasites were not already present from the start of
the experiment, because that would mean that the conclusions about dietary protein levels
would be biased by the presence of the parasites.
We report the presence of parasites because we think it important that it is
considered when interpreting the results and only suggest that it could
indicate a reduction in immunity. We have not deleted any mention of the
parasites but if necessary can do so.
Approximately 50% of the pigeons fed the 6 and 10% CP diets were infected
10
with parasites and as mentioned in the discussion, although parasite burden
was not measured at the start of the experiment 2, the pigeons were
randomly distributed across the three treatment groups, and a chance of
having the pigeons without parasite infection all placed into the 14% CP
group would be low.
We did not measure parasite burden at the start of the experiment only when
we killed the pigeons after each experiment. We have also stated in the
discussion that no pigeons used in the nitrogen balance study or those
inoculated had parasites when killed.
The statement at line 381 is not very strong at the defence. It is also questionable if Exp 1
then really determined “normal” MNR since it is unknown if these pigeons had parasites or
not.
The text has been changed in the Abstract and Methods to clarify that none
of the pigeons used for nitrogen balance experiment had parasites when they
were killed at the end of the balance study.
294: the discussion is pretty long and might benefit from some cutting so that the central
message is better emphasised. In general, the discussion contains many hypotheses on
underlying mechanisms that have not been investigated, and therefore tend to be
speculative. The authors should reduce that.
Some changes have been made to the Discussion.
Although we have not carried out specific experiments to determine
underlying mechanisms we use published information to try to understand
the contributing causes to the effects we observed on the immune system as a
result of feeding diets containing low concentrations of protein.
307-308: I do not agree here: every measure has a standard deviation. If the authors want to
make the statement that protein provision should have been higher than based on MNR
measurements, than this should have been statistically evaluated (not by number such as 2
out of 5).
We only have data on nitrogen balance from the five pigeons used in the
balance study. We cannot therefore calculate a standard deviation for two of
five pigeons in negative nitrogen balance.
However we could also estimate the proportion of pigeons that may have
been in negative nitrogen balance on the 6% CP diet as follows.
We have the confidence intervals for MNR calculated from data from all five
pigeons on all three diets. The mean MNR was calculated at 400.6 mg N
kg0.75 /d with ± 95% CI values between 204.4 and 597.0 (Figure 1(b)). Based
on the CI calculated for MNR we can be 95% confident that the mean MNR
of the pigeons lies between 96.1 to 280.5 mg N/d.
The average weight of pigeons we used was 365.3g. Therefore based on the
mean MNR, nitrogen intake would be 188.2 mg N/pigeon/d, which is less
than the mean nitrogen intakes, 196.5 mg/d (Table 2) of the pigeons on the
6% CP diet when kept in metabolism cages. Thus requirements are
apparently satisfied.
However, at 1 SD below the mean, based on the SD of nitrogen intakes ±
25.4 (Table 2), nitrogen intakes of some pigeons could have been 171.1 mg/d
which is less than the calculated intake required to satisfy MNR and
therefore requirements would not be satisfied.
At 0.5 SD below the mean, intakes would be 183.8 mg/d, still a little below
that needed (188.2). In a population with a normal distribution and the
proportion of the population below -0.5 SD is about 33% of the population.
11
Thus slightly more than 33% of the pigeons could be in negative nitrogen
balance – a percentage not much different from the 40% derived from the
number of pigeons, 2 out of 5, found empirically to be in negative nitrogen
balance.
398-400: can be, but other studies demonstrate that gastrointestinal parasites can affect
nutrient balances (and voluntary feed intake).
We have deleted the sentence
“However, Bermingham et al. [56] have shown that Trichostrongylus
colubriformis infection in lambs does not reduce amino acid absorption from
the small intestine or circulating concentrations of amino acids.”
And added the following
“In poultry digestive enzyme activity can be reduced in the presence of
Ascaridia galli [58]. Although Walker and Farrell [59] showed that A. galli
reduced energy and protein retention by about 20% of that of uninfected
poultry, parasites do not always have an effect on reducing net absorption of
amino acids [60]. Crompton and Nesheim [61] suggest that there are no
consistent interactions between nutrition and parasites and contrary to the
findings here in which parasite burden was greater in pigeons on the low
protein diets, Permin et al. [55] have shown that laying hens given a diet
containing 14% protein grew better and had a lower parasite burden than those
given a diet containing 18% protein.”

415: is that not contradicting the statement about lack of N due to immune reaction?
We have changed the sentence so that it now reads:
We suggest that the pigeons eating the 6% CP diet were at or slightly to the
right of point A (Figure 3); that is their N intakes were equal to or slightly
below their MNR: as they were not losing body weight, their energy and
other nutrient intakes (besides nitrogen) were probably adequate to meet
requirements: they could thus have been in steady-state negative N balance
(region (b), Figure 3 as defined by Vogel et al. [62]).

428-429: I don’t think you can measure “N status” with these parameters, since it is also
normal to have amino acid catabolism for energy production in many species, and does not
necessarily need to point to negative N balance. With stable isotopes, you might indeed find

out if more of the N is spent for immunity.
The sentence has been changed as follows
“It may therefore be advisable to measure uric acid, urea and d15 N as has
been suggested by Vogel et al. [62] when determining N requirements for
different physiological functions so as to better assess N status of
experimental birds.”
645: the authors should acknowledge somewhere that they cannot fully claim protein
effects since a decrease in protein coincides with an increase in starch and vice versa. Only if
they would have included diets where protein was exchanged with fat as well, they could
have made statements on protein effects.
The reviewer brings up a point that is well recognised in nutrition research and for
which there is no solution. When diets are formulated so that they have different
concentrations of a particular nutrient there will always be some other variation in
diet compositions.
*** I disagree: there is a solution, as reported in for instance this paper (but many similar ones):
Malheiros et al 2003. Dietary macronutrients, endocrine functioning and intermediary
metabolism in broiler chickens Pair wise substitutions between protein, fat and carbohydrate.
Nutrition Research 23: 567-578.
I can agree that the authors did not use this approach, but they should at least acknowledge the
potential confounding between the increase of one macronutrient and the decrease of another. I
challenge them to test this in a future trial and I would be happy to say that I’m wrong if so :) ***
Isoenergetic diets (also see above as to why we used isoenergetic diets) are used in
nutrition research in order to ensure that intakes of energy and essential nutrients
(besides the nutrient of interest) are similar across all the experimental diets. It is
not possible to formulate diets that have different concentrations of the nutrient of
interest (whether it be a vitamin, mineral, fatty acid or protein) without altering the
concentration of another ingredient besides that providing the nutrient of interest.
*** see previous comment: it is possible to investigate the single effect of one macronutrient by
comparisons ***
Therefore in formulating the experimental diets used here the following
considerations were taken into account.
1. Pigeons’ diets are grain based and thus are high in starch rather than fat.
2. Protein and starch have similar energy values.
3. Fat and carbohydrate have different effects on nitrogen balance.
Carbohydrates tend to have a sparing effect on nitrogen loss.
4. Starch, unlike resistant starches, non-starch polysaccharides and fatty acids,
has not been shown to affect immune function.
5. We used semi-synthetic ingredients rather than natural ingredients that are
more variable in composition.
*** Again, I can follow this reasoning, but whatever choice was made to compensate for the
protein level, this choice might have affected the outcomes, so that it is warranted to inform the
reader that the validity of the results might not be extrapolated to other diet compositions. For
instance: the authors have not given information on the gelatinization degree of the dietary
starch, which does have effects on protein digestibility (Khalek et al 2009 J Anim Physiol Anim
Nutr). The authors do not need to mention that, but I just want to show that any choice might
have affected the results, and so this should be acknowledged in the discussion. ***
13
Figures in the tables have too many decimals.
These have been reduced.
*** ok, thanks ***
Figure 3: I don’t know of this theory with stable and unstable negative N balance, but is
seems unconventional and not fully supported by the data, so it might need some more
clarification if this is something established or part of the authors' hypothesis.
We have used Vogel et al. [62] and Barboza and Parker’s (2006) model of
stable and unstable negative nitrogen balance. A very detailed explanation of
the conceptual model is described in Vogel et al.’s paper.

See Appendix B.
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have tried to tackle an interesting hypothesis, but there are some flaws (choice
of the isocaloric diets, experimental set-up, potential bias due to parasites, …) that make it
difficult to sustain the straight-forward conclusions the authors are making.
We used isoenergetic (isocaloric) diets because energy intakes, both high
and low (relative to requirements), have been shown to influence nitrogen
balance (e.g. Monroe 1978, Young 1986). To use diets that are not
isoenergetic would create considerable problems in feed formulation in
order to ensure that intakes of nutrients other than protein would be similar
across diets. Protein and carbohydrates have similar energy values so that
substitution of the protein source with a carbohydrate does not significantly
alter energy content of the diet: this is a well-recognised experimental
technique used in many species of animals including pigs (e.g. van Heugten
et al. 1994). Resistant starches and non-starch polysaccharides have been
shown to influence the immune system (Bao and Choct, 2010) and there is no
evidence that corn (maize) or wheat starch do so. Substituting protein for fat
could also cause nutritional problems because fatty acids can influence
immune function (e.g. Kidd 2004) and their effects differ depending on
whether they are for example n-6 (omega 6) or n-3 (omega 3) fatty acids
(Korver and Klasing, 1997).

We do not respond specifically to the broad comment that there is a flaw in
the experimental set up because there are no details have been given about
what aspect of the design is flawed.
The aim of Experiment 1, the nitrogen balance experiment, was to determine
whether the diets to be used in the study of protein intakes on immune
determine whether a dietary protein concentration of 6%, which is similar to
that calculated from Figure 6.5 in Klasing (1998) for maintenance of protein
requirements, would be adequate.
The wording in the Abstract and Introduction has been changed to clarify
this.
The presence of intestinal parasites causing a potential bias was discussed
however we have inserted additional discussion and references to clarify and
justify our use of the data despite the presence of parasites in some of the
pigeons.

The data can be interesting anyhow, but the authors will have to redraft the paper towards
much more careful considerations, and remove speculations from the discussion.
We have considered the reviewers comment and have made minor changes to
the manuscript however we believe that a discussion can contain some
speculation and have therefore not made sweeping changes.
To my opinion, there is not enough solid evidence to make the statement that protein
maintenance requirements are not covering enough for immunity, but they might make an
addition to science by describing the impact of immunity on nitrogen balance in pigeons.
The design of the experiment does not allow us to determine the impact of
immunity on nitrogen balance. The treatments applied to the pigeons would
have to be completely different to do what the reviewer suggests. In order to
measure what the reviewer suggests it would be necessary for the treatments
to cause a non-dietary change in the functioning of the immune system by the
application of immunological stressors e.g. inoculation of the pigeons or
exposure to pathogens and then to measure nitrogen balance in those birds.
Nitrogen balance of pigeons kept in the metabolism cages would then
indicate an increase or decrease in protein requirement as a result of a
change in immune system activity: another possibility would be to use
isotopes of nitrogen to determine protein turnover in the pigeons. We have
not made any changes to the manuscript with respect to this comment.
The response however may not be easy to interpret as Klasing and Barnes
(1988) showed that methionine requirement decreased in growing chicks
because immunological stress decreased growth rate.
Klasing K C, Barnes DM. 1988 Decreased amino acid requirements of
growing chicks due to immunologic stress. J Nutr. 118, 1158–1164.
Researchers such as Kirk Klasing in UC Davis have already done much work on the nutritional
cost of immunity in birds, so the authors might need to check how their data still add to
existing knowledge.
We are familiar with the research work of Kirk Klasing and his excellent
work and reviews on nutrition and immunity. However he has not carried out
nor have others.
We have listed in the introduction a number of references on the effects of
protein intakes on immune function in a number of species from insects to
humans. There are none in domestic pigeons and there are not many
references for birds other than domestic birds.
We therefore believe that the pigeon data is new and also that it adds to
existing knowledge on the effects of protein intakes on innate and acquired
immune functions.
We did not measure protein costs of an immune response, which Klasing
(2004 quoted by Hasselquist and Nilson 2012) calculated from the turnover
of lysine as less than 7% of total protein required in growing chicks. A value
for the cost of immune responses would depend on the type of immune
response elicited or measured (Kogut and Klasing 2009), whether the bird
was growing or not and how protein (in effect amino acids) was being
portioned in the body.

24 & title: I am not sure that you can make that conclusion, since a decreased response is
not necessarily insufficient. You can however state that immune response responds to
dietary protein above requirement.
Our data show that antibody production in pigeons given the 6 and 10%
protein diets is significantly reduced compared to those given the 14%
protein diet. A decrease in antibody production in response to NDV
inoculation could increase the risk of Newcastle disease developing on
exposure to the virus. And thus immunity is not adequately sustained.
However we have slightly changed the wording in the last sentence of the
abstract.
We have changed the title to
Functions of innate and acquired immune system are reduced in domestic
pigeons (Columba livia domestica) given a low protein diet.

A loss in body weight does not necessarily indicate nor is it necessarily
proportional to nitrogen loss. Changes in body weight may be due to changes
in water, fat or nitrogen content. During natural periods of starvation in e.g.
penguins, rate of loss of fat is much more rapid than that of protein (e.g.

The validity of nitrogen balance and regression analysis for determining
requirements has been discussed in detail by others (e.g. Hegsted 1976,
Young 1986, Manatt and Garcia 1992, Murphy 1993) and we know of the
inherent problems with the methodology that can contribute to an over or
under estimation of requirements. However, it is a relatively cheap non-
invasive method and for species for which no other data are available it
provides a relatively cheap and non-invasive estimation on which further
work can be based.

229-231: What the authors measure is apparent N retention, so it is not surprising that this
decreases with lower dietary protein because the basal loss of endogenous N is
proportionally higher within the total N loss when dietary protein goes down. This is why for
instance “standardised” ileal digestible amino acids are used in practical pig nutrition.
The experiment was not designed to determine digestibility of soy protein
amino acids in pigeons.
Measuring concentrations of amino acids in the ileum and comparing them
with the concentrations in ingested feed give a measure of digestibility
(amount absorbed or assimilated) before digesta reaches the caecum. The
non-protein nitrogen.
Pigeons have only vestigial caeca so synthesis of large quantities of amino
acids by bacteria is unlikely to occur.
279-281: The authors try to turn this event into an opportunity, which is nice, but they
should be able to demonstrate that the parasites were not already present from the start of
the experiment, because that would mean that the conclusions about dietary protein levels
would be biased by the presence of the parasites.
We report the presence of parasites because we think it important that it is
considered when interpreting the results and only suggest that it could
indicate a reduction in immunity. We have not deleted any mention of the
parasites but if necessary can do so.
Approximately 50% of the pigeons fed the 6 and 10% CP diets were infected
with parasites and as mentioned in the discussion, although parasite burden
was not measured at the start of the experiment 2, the pigeons were
randomly distributed across the three treatment groups, and a chance of
having the pigeons without parasite infection all placed into the 14% CP
group would be low.
We did not measure parasite burden at the start of the experiment only when
we killed the pigeons after each experiment. We have also stated in the
discussion that no pigeons used in the nitrogen balance study or those
inoculated had parasites when killed.
The statement at line 381 is not very strong at the defence. It is also questionable if Exp 1
then really determined “normal” MNR since it is unknown if these pigeons had parasites or
not.
The text has been changed in the Abstract and Methods to clarify that none
of the pigeons used for nitrogen balance experiment had parasites when they
were killed at the end of the balance study.
294: the discussion is pretty long and might benefit from some cutting so that the central
message is better emphasised. In general, the discussion contains many hypotheses on
underlying mechanisms that have not been investigated, and therefore tend to be
speculative. The authors should reduce that.
Some changes have been made to the Discussion.
Although we have not carried out specific experiments to determine
underlying mechanisms we use published information to try to understand
the contributing causes to the effects we observed on the immune system as a
result of feeding diets containing low concentrations of protein.
307-308: I do not agree here: every measure has a standard deviation. If the authors want to
make the statement that protein provision should have been higher than based on MNR
measurements, than this should have been statistically evaluated (not by number such as 2
out of 5).
balance study. We cannot therefore calculate a standard deviation for two of
five pigeons in negative nitrogen balance.
However we could also estimate the proportion of pigeons that may have
been in negative nitrogen balance on the 6% CP diet as follows.
We have the confidence intervals for MNR calculated from data from all five
pigeons on all three diets. The mean MNR was calculated at 400.6 mg N
kg0.75 /d with ± 95% CI values between 204.4 and 597.0 (Figure 1(b)). Based
on the CI calculated for MNR we can be 95% confident that the mean MNR
of the pigeons lies between 96.1 to 280.5 mg N/d.
The average weight of pigeons we used was 365.3g. Therefore based on the
mean MNR, nitrogen intake would be 188.2 mg N/pigeon/d, which is less
than the mean nitrogen intakes, 196.5 mg/d (Table 2) of the pigeons on the
6% CP diet when kept in metabolism cages. Thus requirements are
apparently satisfied.
However, at 1 SD below the mean, based on the SD of nitrogen intakes ±
25.4 (Table 2), nitrogen intakes of some pigeons could have been 171.1 mg/d
which is less than the calculated intake required to satisfy MNR and
therefore requirements would not be satisfied.
At 0.5 SD below the mean, intakes would be 183.8 mg/d, still a little below
that needed (188.2). In a population with a normal distribution and the
proportion of the population below -0.5 SD is about 33% of the population.
Thus slightly more than 33% of the pigeons could be in negative nitrogen
balance – a percentage not much different from the 40% derived from the
number of pigeons, 2 out of 5, found empirically to be in negative nitrogen
balance.
398-400: can be, but other studies demonstrate that gastrointestinal parasites can affect
nutrient balances (and voluntary feed intake).
We have deleted the sentence
“However, Bermingham et al. [56] have shown that Trichostrongylus
colubriformis infection in lambs does not reduce amino acid absorption from
the small intestine or circulating concentrations of amino acids.”
And added the following
“In poultry digestive enzyme activity can be reduced in the presence of
Ascaridia galli [58]. Although Walker and Farrell [59] showed that A. galli
reduced energy and protein retention by about 20% of that of uninfected
poultry, parasites do not always have an effect on reducing net absorption of
amino acids [60]. Crompton and Nesheim [61] suggest that there are no
consistent interactions between nutrition and parasites and contrary to the
findings here in which parasite burden was greater in pigeons on the low
protein diets, Permin et al. [55] have shown that laying hens given a diet
given a diet containing 18% protein.”

415: is that not contradicting the statement about lack of N due to immune reaction?
We have changed the sentence so that it now reads:
We suggest that the pigeons eating the 6% CP diet were at or slightly to the
right of point A (Figure 3); that is their N intakes were equal to or slightly
below their MNR: as they were not losing body weight, their energy and
other nutrient intakes (besides nitrogen) were probably adequate to meet
requirements: they could thus have been in steady-state negative N balance
(region (b), Figure 3 as defined by Vogel et al. [62]).

428-429: I don’t think you can measure “N status” with these parameters, since it is also
normal to have amino acid catabolism for energy production in many species, and does not
necessarily need to point to negative N balance. With stable isotopes, you might indeed find
out if more of the N is spent for immunity.
The sentence has been changed as follows
“It may therefore be advisable to measure uric acid, urea and d15 N as has
been suggested by Vogel et al. [62] when determining N requirements for
different physiological functions so as to better assess N status of
experimental birds.”
645: the authors should acknowledge somewhere that they cannot fully claim protein
effects since a decrease in protein coincides with an increase in starch and vice versa. Only if
have made statements on protein effects.
The reviewer brings up a point that is well recognised in nutrition research and for
which there is no solution. When diets are formulated so that they have different
concentrations of a particular nutrient there will always be some other variation in
diet compositions.
Isoenergetic diets (also see above as to why we used isoenergetic diets) are used in
nutrition research in order to ensure that intakes of energy and essential nutrients
(besides the nutrient of interest) are similar across all the experimental diets. It is
not possible to formulate diets that have different concentrations of the nutrient of
interest (whether it be a vitamin, mineral, fatty acid or protein) without altering the
concentration of another ingredient besides that providing the nutrient of interest.
Therefore in formulating the experimental diets used here the following
considerations were taken into account.
1. Pigeons’ diets are grain based and thus are high in starch rather than fat.
2. Protein and starch have similar energy values.
3. Fat and carbohydrate have different effects on nitrogen balance.
Carbohydrates tend to have a sparing effect on nitrogen loss.
4. Starch, unlike resistant starches, non-starch polysaccharides and fatty acids,
has not been shown to affect immune function.
5. We used semi-synthetic ingredients rather than natural ingredients that are
more variable in composition.
Figures in the tables have too many decimals.
These have been reduced.
Figure 3: I don’t know of this theory with stable and unstable negative N balance, but is
seems unconventional and not fully supported by the data, so it might need some more
clarification if this is something established or part of the authors' hypothesis.
We have used Vogel et al. [62] and Barboza and Parker’s (2006) model of
stable and unstable negative nitrogen balance. A very detailed explanation of
the conceptual model is described in Vogel et al.’s paper.

Abstract: Racing pigeons are exposed to and act as carriers of diseases. Dietary protein
requirement for their maintenance has not been determined experimentally despite their
being domesticated for over 7,000 years. Maintenance nitrogen (protein) requirement
(MNR) of pigeons was determined in a balance study using diets containing 6, 10 and 14%
crude protein (CP). Then, the effects of feeding different CP diets at or above maintenance
were investigated to determine whether MNR was adequate to sustain innate and acquired
immunity. Nitrogen intake from a 6% CP diet was sufficient to maintain nitrogen balance and
body weight in pigeons. However the immune functions of phagocytosis, oxidative burst and
lymphocyte proliferation in pigeons fed this diet were reduced compared to those fed 10
and 14% CP diets. Pigeons given the 6 and 10% CP diets had lower antibody titres following
inoculation against Newcastle disease (ND) vaccine than those on the 14% CP diet. A
confounding factor found on autopsy was the presence of intestinal parasites in some of the
pigeons given the 6 and 10% CP diets however none of the pigeons used to measure
acquired immunity to ND were infested with parasites. In conclusion, MNR does not
adequately sustain immunity of pigeons.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have tried to tackle an interesting hypothesis, but there are some flaws (choice
of the isocaloric diets, experimental set-up, potential bias due to parasites, …) that make it
difficult to sustain the straight-forward conclusions the authors are making.
We used isoenergetic (isocaloric) diets because energy intakes, both high
and low (relative to requirements), have been shown to influence nitrogen
balance (e.g. Monroe 1978, Young 1986). To use diets that are not
isoenergetic would create considerable problems in feed formulation in
order to ensure that intakes of nutrients other than protein would be similar
across diets. Protein and carbohydrates have similar energy values so that
substitution of the protein source with a carbohydrate does not significantly
alter energy content of the diet: this is a well-recognised experimental
technique used in many species of animals including pigs (e.g. van Heugten
et al. 1994). Resistant starches and non-starch polysaccharides have been
shown to influence the immune system (Bao and Choct, 2010) and there is no
evidence that corn (maize) or wheat starch do so. Substituting protein for fat
could also cause nutritional problems because fatty acids can influence
immune function (e.g. Kidd 2004) and their effects differ depending on
whether they are for example n-6 (omega 6) or n-3 (omega 3) fatty acids
(Korver and Klasing, 1997).

We have not responded to this here.
The aim of Experiment 1, the nitrogen balance experiment, was to determine
whether the diets to be used in the study of protein intakes on immune
determine whether a dietary protein concentration of 6%, which is similar to
that calculated from Figure 6.5 in Klasing (1998) for maintenance of protein
requirements, would be adequate.
The wording in the Abstract and Introduction has been changed to clarify
this.
The presence of intestinal parasites causing a potential bias was discussed
however we have inserted additional discussion and references to clarify and
justify our use of the data despite the presence of parasites in some of the
pigeons.

*** Thanks for this elaborate answer. The above was mainly my general appreciation of the
manuscript. My specific comments were listed below. Sorry if that was not clear. ***
Authors’ response:
We do not think a response is required.
The data can be interesting anyhow, but the authors will have to redraft the paper towards
much more careful considerations, and remove speculations from the discussion.
We have considered the reviewers comment and have made minor changes to
the manuscript however we believe that a discussion can contain some
speculation and have therefore not made sweeping changes.
*** Ok, I will check. ***
Authors’ response:
We do not think a response is required.
To my opinion, there is not enough solid evidence to make the statement that protein
maintenance requirements are not covering enough for immunity, but they might make an
addition to science by describing the impact of immunity on nitrogen balance in pigeons.
The design of the experiment does not allow us to determine the impact of
immunity on nitrogen balance. The treatments applied to the pigeons would
have to be completely different to do what the reviewer suggests. In order to
measure what the reviewer suggests it would be necessary for the treatments
to cause a non-dietary change in the functioning of the immune system by the
application of immunological stressors e.g. inoculation of the pigeons or
exposure to pathogens and then to measure nitrogen balance in those birds.
Nitrogen balance of pigeons kept in the metabolism cages would then
indicate an increase or decrease in protein requirement as a result of a
change in immune system activity: another possibility would be to use
isotopes of nitrogen to determine protein turnover in the pigeons. We have
not made any changes to the manuscript with respect to this comment.
The response however may not be easy to interpret as Klasing and Barnes
(1988) showed that methionine requirement decreased in growing chicks
because immunological stress decreased growth rate.
*** I don’t really agree on this one: nutritional demands for the immune system can differ even if not
experimentally challenged. Intact proteins themselves can already alter immunoglobulin titers and
cytokines. I agree that the authors demonstrated that there is a change in the immunological profile of
the pigeons, but I disagree that this demonstrates insufficiency. ***
Authors’ Response:
We believe a lowered antibody titre production to NDV is indicative of a reduction in immune
function.
growing chicks due to immunologic stress. J Nutr. 118, 1158–1164.
Researchers such as Kirk Klasing in UC Davis have already done much work on the nutritional
cost of immunity in birds, so the authors might need to check how their data still add to
existing knowledge.
We are familiar with the research work of Kirk Klasing and his excellent
work and reviews on nutrition and immunity. However he has not carried out
research on protein and immunity in pigeons and as far as we can ascertain
nor have others.
*** That is correct, but then the authors might need to explain better why it is important to have this
work done in pigeons. Which general scientific insights have been gained here ? Or is the only addition
to science that it has now been demonstrated in pigeons ? ***
Authors’ response:
We have already summerised reasons for doing the work in the Introduction and its relevance in
the Conclusions. We also query the use of “only” with reference to the work being an addition
to science.
We have listed in the introduction a number of references on the effects of
protein intakes on immune function in a number of species from insects to
humans. There are none in domestic pigeons and there are not many
references for birds other than domestic birds.
We therefore believe that the pigeon data is new and also that it adds to
existing knowledge on the effects of protein intakes on innate and acquired
immune functions.
*** So please be more specific on this in the discussion. ***
Authors’ response:
There are a number of places in the discussion where we use references listed in the
Introduction that are about the effects of different levels of protein intakes on immunity e.g.:-
phagocytosis in chickens, bactericidal effects of guinea pig neutrophils, insect phenoloxidase
production, lysozyme and C reactive protein of trout neutrophils and macrophages, NDV
antibody titres in poultry and Peyer’s patches in cotton rats. We do not feel additional
discussion is required.
We did not measure protein costs of an immune response, which Klasing
(2004 quoted by Hasselquist and Nilson 2012) calculated from the turnover
of lysine as less than 7% of total protein required in growing chicks. A value
for the cost of immune responses would depend on the type of immune
response elicited or measured (Kogut and Klasing 2009), whether the bird
was growing or not and how protein (in effect amino acids) was being
portioned in the body.

24 & title: I am not sure that you can make that conclusion, since a decreased response is
not necessarily insufficient. You can however state that immune response responds to
dietary protein above requirement.
*** I agree that this is not necessary here, and might need too many assumptions.***
Authors’ response:
We do not think a response is required.
Our data show that antibody production in pigeons given the 6 and 10%
protein diets is significantly reduced compared to those given the 14%
protein diet. A decrease in antibody production in response to NDV
inoculation could increase the risk of Newcastle disease developing on
exposure to the virus. And thus immunity is not adequately sustained.
However we have slightly changed the wording in the last sentence of the
abstract.
We have changed the title to
Functions of innate and acquired immune system are reduced in domestic
pigeons (Columba livia domestica) given a low protein diet.
*** Ok, I am still not fond of “Functions of …” since functionality would imply the potential of
pigeons to resist disease, but I can live with that. ***

A loss in body weight does not necessarily indicate nor is it necessarily
proportional to nitrogen loss. Changes in body weight may be due to changes
in water, fat or nitrogen content. During natural periods of starvation in e.g.
penguins, rate of loss of fat is much more rapid than that of protein (e.g.
Groscolas and Robin 2001).

*** Yes, I agree that fat mobilization usually occurs at a faster rate than lean mass mobilization (water
and protein), but all DO occur and commonly show a linear relationship, meaning that the authors
should again acknowledge that the negative balance in their study might have affected the results. ***
Authors’ response:
As body weight was not reduced in the pigeons on the low (6%) protein diet, we believe that
nitrogen balance was affected but not energy balance. We have not changed the discussion.
The validity of nitrogen balance and regression analysis for determining
requirements has been discussed in detail by others (e.g. Hegsted 1976,
Young 1986, Manatt and Garcia 1992, Murphy 1993) and we know of the
inherent problems with the methodology that can contribute to an over or
under estimation of requirements. However, it is a relatively cheap noninvasive
method and for species for which no other data are available it
provides a relatively cheap and non-invasive estimation on which further
work can be based.

*** Indeed, I can understand that a cheap method was used, but a correct interpretation is then crucial
to provide readers with accurate information, so the downsides of the applied method need to be
discussed. This does not reduce the value of the manuscript, but makes it stronger. ***
Authors’ response:
We do not believe that it is necessary to increase the length of the discussion by addition of a
discussion of nutrient balance methodology as this is adequately covered in a number of
papers that we have listed above. We have therefore not changed the discussion.
229-231: What the authors measure is apparent N retention, so it is not surprising that this
decreases with lower dietary protein because the basal loss of endogenous N is
proportionally higher within the total N loss when dietary protein goes down. This is why for
instance “standardised” ileal digestible amino acids are used in practical pig nutrition.
The experiment was not designed to determine digestibility of soy protein
amino acids in pigeons.
Measuring concentrations of amino acids in the ileum and comparing them
with the concentrations in ingested feed give a measure of digestibility
(amount absorbed or assimilated) before digesta reaches the caecum. The
caecum contains micro-organisms capable of synthesising amino acids from
non-protein nitrogen.
Pigeons have only vestigial caeca so synthesis of large quantities of amino
acids by bacteria is unlikely to occur.
*** I’m sorry if my comment was not clear enough: even if you look at ileal digestibility, there are
basal endogenous losses, coming from for instance secreted digestive juices and desquamated intestinal
cells. Please look at the explanation of the concept of “standardized digestibility” in pig nutrition.
Especially in birds, these losses can be high, and not negligible. When you feed a low protein level, the
basal endogenous losses might be the same in absolute terms, but will take a much higher proportion of
the excreted nitrogen, even if the true digestibility is the same, hence rendering a lower figure for
apparent digestibility and retention. Therefore, the authors cannot claim that there was lower N
retention with lower dietary protein. ***
Authors’ response:
We do not write that there was lower protein retention but do say that nitrogen balance in the
pigeons differed across the diets. We were not measuring digestibility as such although it
could be determined from our data.
The only mention we make regarding digestibility is in the first paragraph of the discussion as
follows:- “However, there can be considerable variation in MNR because its value can be
affected by the digestibility and quality of protein, energy and ingredients used in an
experimental diet [47]: this was not relevant in these experiments as the same experimental
diets were used to determine N requirements and immune functions.”
We have not therefore changed any of the manuscript text.
279-281: The authors try to turn this event into an opportunity, which is nice, but they
should be able to demonstrate that the parasites were not already present from the start of
the experiment, because that would mean that the conclusions about dietary protein levels
would be biased by the presence of the parasites.
We report the presence of parasites because we think it important that it is
considered when interpreting the results and only suggest that it could
indicate a reduction in immunity. We have not deleted any mention of the
Approximately 50% of the pigeons fed the 6 and 10% CP diets were infected
with parasites and as mentioned in the discussion, although parasite burden
was not measured at the start of the experiment 2, the pigeons were
randomly distributed across the three treatment groups, and a chance of
having the pigeons without parasite infection all placed into the 14% CP
group would be low.
We did not measure parasite burden at the start of the experiment only when
we killed the pigeons after each experiment. We have also stated in the
discussion that no pigeons used in the nitrogen balance study or those
inoculated had parasites when killed.
The statement at line 381 is not very strong at the defence. It is also questionable if Exp 1
then really determined “normal” MNR since it is unknown if these pigeons had parasites or
not.
The text has been changed in the Abstract and Methods to clarify that none
of the pigeons used for nitrogen balance experiment had parasites when they
were killed at the end of the balance study.
294: the discussion is pretty long and might benefit from some cutting so that the central
message is better emphasised. In general, the discussion contains many hypotheses on
underlying mechanisms that have not been investigated, and therefore tend to be
speculative. The authors should reduce that.
Some changes have been made to the Discussion.
Although we have not carried out specific experiments to determine
underlying mechanisms we use published information to try to understand
the contributing causes to the effects we observed on the immune system as a
result of feeding diets containing low concentrations of protein.
307-308: I do not agree here: every measure has a standard deviation. If the authors want to
make the statement that protein provision should have been higher than based on MNR
measurements, than this should have been statistically evaluated (not by number such as 2
out of 5).
We only have data on nitrogen balance from the five pigeons used in the
balance study. We cannot therefore calculate a standard deviation for two of
five pigeons in negative nitrogen balance.
However we could also estimate the proportion of pigeons that may have
been in negative nitrogen balance on the 6% CP diet as follows.
We have the confidence intervals for MNR calculated from data from all five
pigeons on all three diets. The mean MNR was calculated at 400.6 mg N
kg0.75 /d with ± 95% CI values between 204.4 and 597.0 (Figure 1(b)). Based
on the CI calculated for MNR we can be 95% confident that the mean MNR
of the pigeons lies between 96.1 to 280.5 mg N/d.
The average weight of pigeons we used was 365.3g. Therefore based on the
mean MNR, nitrogen intake would be 188.2 mg N/pigeon/d, which is less
than the mean nitrogen intakes, 196.5 mg/d (Table 2) of the pigeons on the
6% CP diet when kept in metabolism cages. Thus requirements are
apparently satisfied.
However, at 1 SD below the mean, based on the SD of nitrogen intakes ±
25.4 (Table 2), nitrogen intakes of some pigeons could have been 171.1 mg/d
which is less than the calculated intake required to satisfy MNR and
therefore requirements would not be satisfied.
At 0.5 SD below the mean, intakes would be 183.8 mg/d, still a little below
that needed (188.2). In a population with a normal distribution and the
proportion of the population below -0.5 SD is about 33% of the population.
Thus slightly more than 33% of the pigeons could be in negative nitrogen
balance – a percentage not much different from the 40% derived from the
number of pigeons, 2 out of 5, found empirically to be in negative nitrogen
398-400: can be, but other studies demonstrate that gastrointestinal parasites can affect
nutrient balances (and voluntary feed intake).
We have deleted the sentence
“However, Bermingham et al. [56] have shown that Trichostrongylus
colubriformis infection in lambs does not reduce amino acid absorption from
the small intestine or circulating concentrations of amino acids.”
And added the following
“In poultry digestive enzyme activity can be reduced in the presence of
Ascaridia galli [58]. Although Walker and Farrell [59] showed that A. galli
reduced energy and protein retention by about 20% of that of uninfected
poultry, parasites do not always have an effect on reducing net absorption of
amino acids [60]. Crompton and Nesheim [61] suggest that there are no
consistent interactions between nutrition and parasites and contrary to the
findings here in which parasite burden was greater in pigeons on the low
protein diets, Permin et al. [55] have shown that laying hens given a diet
containing 14% protein grew better and had a lower parasite burden than those
given a diet containing 18% protein.”

415: is that not contradicting the statement about lack of N due to immune reaction?
We have changed the sentence so that it now reads:
We suggest that the pigeons eating the 6% CP diet were at or slightly to the
right of point A (Figure 3); that is their N intakes were equal to or slightly
below their MNR: as they were not losing body weight, their energy and
other nutrient intakes (besides nitrogen) were probably adequate to meet
requirements: they could thus have been in steady-state negative N balance
(region (b), Figure 3 as defined by Vogel et al. [62]).

428-429: I don’t think you can measure “N status” with these parameters, since it is also
normal to have amino acid catabolism for energy production in many species, and does not
necessarily need to point to negative N balance. With stable isotopes, you might indeed find
out if more of the N is spent for immunity.
The sentence has been changed as follows
“It may therefore be advisable to measure uric acid, urea and d15 N as has
been suggested by Vogel et al. [62] when determining N requirements for
different physiological functions so as to better assess N status of
experimental birds.”
645: the authors should acknowledge somewhere that they cannot fully claim protein
they would have included diets where protein was exchanged with fat as well, they could
have made statements on protein effects.
The reviewer brings up a point that is well recognised in nutrition research and for
which there is no solution. When diets are formulated so that they have different
concentrations of a particular nutrient there will always be some other variation in
diet compositions.
*** I disagree: there is a solution, as reported in for instance this paper (but many similar ones):
Malheiros et al 2003. Dietary macronutrients, endocrine functioning and intermediary metabolism in
broiler chickens Pair wise substitutions between protein, fat and carbohydrate. Nutrition Research 23:
567-578.
I can agree that the authors did not use this approach, but they should at least acknowledge the
potential confounding between the increase of one macronutrient and the decrease of another. I
challenge them to test this in a future trial and I would be happy to say that I’m wrong if so :) ***
Authors’ response:
According to Table 1 of the paper by Malheiros et al. (2003, see below} neither the diet
ingredients nor the nutrient compositions of the three diets used in the experiment are similar. We
therefore do not accept that this would be a suitable format to follow for the experiment we
carried out. The low lipid and low carbohydrate diets have similar protein contents but there are
no similar low lipid or low carbohydrate diets formulated for the low protein diet. Although some
of the diet ingredients are similar across the diets there is a difference between maize contents of
the low lipid and low carbohydrate diets contents that might affect the micronutrient contents.
Although contents of some of the micronutrients are given there is no information about e.g. fat-
soluble vitamin or trace minerals such as selenium that could affect immunity. There are also
differences in soybean and starch contents.
Isoenergetic diets (also see above as to why we used isoenergetic diets) are used in
nutrition research in order to ensure that intakes of energy and essential nutrients
(besides the nutrient of interest) are similar across all the experimental diets. It is
not possible to formulate diets that have different concentrations of the nutrient of
interest (whether it be a vitamin, mineral, fatty acid or protein) without altering the
concentration of another ingredient besides that providing the nutrient of interest.
*** see previous comment: it is possible to investigate the single effect of one macronutrient by
comparisons ***
Authors’ response:
See response above to previous comment.
Therefore in formulating the experimental diets used here the following
considerations were taken into account.
1. Pigeons’ diets are grain based and thus are high in starch rather than fat.
2. Protein and starch have similar energy values.
3. Fat and carbohydrate have different effects on nitrogen balance.
Carbohydrates tend to have a sparing effect on nitrogen loss.
4. Starch, unlike resistant starches, non-starch polysaccharides and fatty acids,
has not been shown to affect immune function.
5. We used semi-synthetic ingredients rather than natural ingredients that are
more variable in composition.
*** Again, I can follow this reasoning, but whatever choice was made to compensate for the protein
validity of the results might not be extrapolated to other diet compositions. For instance: the authors
have not given information on the gelatinization degree of the dietary starch, which does have effects
on protein digestibility (Khalek et al 2009 J Anim Physiol Anim Nutr). The authors do not need to
mention that, but I just want to show that any choice might have affected the results, and so this should
be acknowledged in the discussion. ***
Authors’ response:
The pelleting process used for the three diets was similar and the process used for pelleting
the diets was not an extrusion process referred to in the paper by El-Khalek et al (2009). As
we did not measure digestibility but nitrogen balance, we do not think that it is necessary to
discuss this phenomenon.
Figures in the tables have too many decimals.
These have been reduced.
*** ok, thanks ***
Authors’ response:
We do not think a response is required.
Figure 3: I don’t know of this theory with stable and unstable negative N balance, but is
seems unconventional and not fully supported by the data, so it might need some more
clarification if this is something established or part of the authors' hypothesis.
We have used Vogel et al. [62] and Barboza and Parker’s (2006) model of
stable and unstable negative nitrogen balance. A very detailed explanation of
the conceptual model is described in Vogel et al.’s paper.
