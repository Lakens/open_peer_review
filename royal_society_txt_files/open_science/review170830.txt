This manuscript investigate the mechanisms leading to language change. It provides an excellent
example of how new quantitative understanding can be obtained through the combination of
large datasets and new mechanistic models. In particular, a significant contribution of this
manuscript is the finding and model of the latency periods before the onset of the fastest regime
of change. The presentation and style of the manuscript are accessible to a broad audience and
the model is insightful and discussed in detail. The only point I believe needs to be more
significantly improved before publication is the connection between the theoretical model and the
data analysis, as explained in the main point below. In summary, this is an interesting manuscript
based on a multidisciplinary collaboration and that provides a significant contribution to the
much needed quantitative understanding of language change. I recommend it for publication
after the main point below is clarified.
* Main point
On several occasions I could not identify how the analysis performed in the data relates to the
theoretical model and to the claims made in the manuscript. This is partially because of the strong
claims made in the manuscript in this regard, which increased my expectations regarding the
data analysis. In particular, in the abstract the authors claim that "we provide the first corpus-
based quantitative confirmation of the S-curve in language change" and on page 4 they conclude
that "we thus find a robust statistical validation of the sigmoidal pattern". In practice, the analysis
amounts to a straight line fit of a transformed datasets, a procedure that I could not find fully
justified (see more below). It is shown together with visual inspection and reported together with
the computation of a correlation coefficient (r^2). Importantly, there is no comparison of the
sigmoidal pattern (or of any of the proposed models) with alternative models and there is no
statistical evidence that the data is a likely outcome of the theoretical (Sigmoidal) models (e.g., in
form of a p-value). It is not clear to me what is the outcome of this analysis that would lead to a
rejection of the pattern. The analysis based on the "inverse Gaussian fit" (Fig. 7) is not directly
related to the S-curve part and I don't see how it can validate it either (moreover, it is evident
from Fig. 7 that a rigorous statistical test will reject the hypothesis that the data follows the
distribution). I believe the methodology (see more below) and claims (mentioned above)
regarding the statistical analysis of the data should be revisited. If the main contribution of the
paper is the theoretical model and the fact that it explains (qualitatively) some observation, this
should be more clearly stated in the manuscript.
1) It is not clear to me how the mechanistic model and the fit of sigmoids relate to each other. Can
the sigmoid expression (6) be deduced from the model? What is the relation between the
parameters of the sigmoid (xmin, xmax, h, b) and the ones of the model (N, beta, delta, etc.)?
2) The rationale behind the sigmoid fit is not clear to me. I understand the convenience of
performing such a fit, but the statistical justification and implications for this procedure are not
clear to me.
- Why is the fit done in the "smoothed" dataset? In general this artificially reduces the
fluctuations.
- I could not recover the linear relationship by inserting Eq. (6) in Eq. (5) (I recover it only for
x_min =0). Please clarify.
- The least square fit assumes uniform Gaussian errors in the transformed variables. Why is this
reasonable? I would expect that the errors in the estimation of the frequency should depend both
on the frequency of the word and on the corpus size (that often vary dramatically over time). A
rigorous statistical analysis should take the errors and fluctuations into account.
- The fit of the data is performed by first selecting the peak on the frequency. From the sample in
Fig. 1 it seems that the distributions are never stabilizing after the peak and that they have several
peaks. It was not clear to me from the text how these features match with the proposed
3
theoretical framework and mathematical model. If the increase in frequency is associated to
semantic expansions, are the reductions in frequency related to semantic contractions?
Furthermore, it seems to me that the choice to stop at the peak of a distribution favors the
sigmoidal observation, at least at the end of the curve since the derivative at the peak is by
construction zero.

- Fig. 5: axis labels would facilitate the understanding of this figure

time and Growth time are done in the Materials and Methods part

In this manuscript the authors study language change as measured by the change in frequency of
specific wordforms leading to the well-known S-curves. Looking at a new database of texts
spanning several centuries, the authors uncover a new previously unknown phenomenon, a so-
called latency period, preceding the S-curve growth. In addition, they propose a new stochastic
model of language change showing that both observations can be interpreted as a result of the
same underlying process.
While the notion of S-curves can be considered a stylized fact, empirical evidence is scarce due to
the lack of rich and reliable data of written text on historical time scales. In this view, the carefully
curated dataset (thousands of texts spanning many hundreds of years) presented by the authors
offers new opportunities for quantitative studies of language of thousands of texts spanning
4
many hundreds of years. The observation of a latency period in the empirical data, together with
their proposed stochastic model, sheds new light on the underlying mechanisms driving
language change. In contrast to many previous works, the authors make a considerable effort to
confront the predictions of their models with empirical observations beyond a mere qualitative
statement.
In my opinion, this manuscript makes a substantial and important contribution to the
understanding of language change in an interdisciplinary framework. Therefore, I think the
manuscript is suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science. However, I do have major
comments and remarks which the authors hopefully address as some of the analysis steps are not
completely clear and some claims are not completely substantiated.
Detailed comments:
1) In the introduction the authors review the field of language change, especially the aspect of
semantic expansion considered here, proposing a separation into cognitive and socio-linguistic
aspects. Not being a linguist, I was unable to judge whether this is common (agreed-upon)
knowledge from linguistics, or constitutes a statement of opinion from the authors.
2) Abstract:
"we provide the first corpus-based quantitative confirmation of the S-curve in language change"
I completely disagree with this statement. S-curves have been investigated quantitatively in
several previous works in different ways. In addition to the review (acknowledged by the authors
of the current manuscript) in [Blythe & Croft, S-curves and the mechanisms of propagation in
language change, Language (2012)], examples looking at small/large corpora and
fitting/modeling S-curves are:
- [Vulanovic & Baayen, Fitting the development of periphrastic do in all sentence types, in "Exact
Methods in the Study of Language and Text", De Gruyer (2007)]
- [Bentley et al., Word diffusion and climate science, PlosOne (2010)]
- [Ghanbarnejad et al., Extracting information from S-curves of language change, R Soc Interface
(2014)]
"We argue that our results are not specific to the studied corpus, but apply to semantic change in
general."
In my view the authors the arguments rather constitute a hypothesis for which only more and
different datasets can bring a definite answer.
2) Selection of studied forms
p.4, line 78: How were the ~400 forms selected? In SI, Sec. IIID, it only says 'we looked at the
frequency of use of about 400 hundred semantic expansions in the functional realm'. While the
authors describe some features that these forms must fulfill, it is not clear how the authors come
up with the list of examples to choose from. Is there a generally accepted list of examples for
semantic expansion in the literature, or are these examples simply chosen based on the intuition
of the authors?
3) Statistical Analysis of Sigmoidal curves
p. 4, line 96: "We thus find a robust statistical validation of the sigmoidal pattern"
From the Materials & Methods (p. 20, line 439) I find that this is assessed by: "the r^2 of the linear
fit should be at least equal to a value depending on the number of the data points."
While the examples in the manuscript give a visual impression of the sigmoidal character of the
curve, the claim "robust statistical validation" would require a proper form of hypothesis testing,
either in the form of a p-value (not rejecting the null hypothesis of a sigmoidal) or in the form of
model selection (the sigmoidal describes the data better than other sensible models).
p.20, Eqs. (6): Should it be $\tilde{x}_{min} = x_{max} + \frac{x_{max}-x_{min}}{1+e^{-hi-b}}$?
5
4) Latency-period
p. 4, line 108: "fast growth is very often preceded by a long latency ..."
The examples in Fig. 1&2 are convincing, but is there a quantification of this phenomenon? if
there are 400 forms and 70% have the sigmoidal, than what fraction of those show a substantial
latency?
5) Modeling
p.8, line 135: "We limit ourselves to the case of a competition between two linguistic variants,
given that most cases of semantic expansion can be understood as such, even if the two
competing variants cannot always be explicitly identified".
This is not obvious at all - perhaps the authors could give more insight into their reasoning.
It is a crucial assumption in the model, especially taking into account that the authors also
assume that the overall usage of the two variants remains constant. In this way we would not be
able to capture aspects of overall growth.
6) Numerical Results
p. 14, line 261: How exactly is $x_c$ maximized (i.e. what is its relation to $\beta$)? Why does
this maximization correspond to a meaningful case representative of language change?
7) Confrontation with corpus:
p. 16, line 302: "We find a good agreement for both the latency and the growth times".
What does 'good' mean? Is the data compatible with the Inverse Gaussian? The choice of Inverse
Gaussian simply comes from the proposed model -- would a simpler model such as a simple
exponential provide an equally good fit?
How is the latency measured in the corpus data (relates to point 4)?
8) Discussion:
p. 18, line 379: Regarding the scaling of growth vs slope with exponent -1.4 (see SI Fig. 2), it is
clear that this scaling does not represent a meaningful fit of the data since all the residuals are
negative (i.e. the fit is clearly biased). Therefore, I am not convinced of the authors' conclusion
that this provides an argument against the sociolinguistic interpretation (predicting a scaling of -
2/3).
9) Minor points
- I came across several typos, e.g. p.3, line 52, 'litterature'
- Figure 3, caption: right inner panel and left inner panel should be reversed in description
- all figures: no axis-labels, numbers are very tiny - almost impossible to read
- SI, Sec. IIIC: "It hosts about 800,000 texts in French (about twenty times more than Frantext)". It
should be 200 times more, right? (800,000 / 4,000 = 200)

The authors have carefully addressed all the points raised by the referees. The answers and the
manuscript contain now detailed discussions of different aspects from both data analysis and
theoretical modelling. Naturally, I do not fully agree with all arguments presented by the
authors. For instance, the new statistical analysis shows (at best) that the sigmoidal curve is better
than one (very naive) null model, while the text claims a "confirmation of the S-curve". That being
said, the new version of the manuscript is much more clear and provides all details so that
readers can judge by themselves the validity of the general claims. More importantly, altogether,
the paper makes important contributions to different aspects of the broad field of quantitative
analysis of language change. Therefore I believe the manuscript should be made available to a
larger audience without further delays and I recommend the publication of this manuscript as is.

I thank the authors for the careful response to all the issues that were raised by both referees. I
appreciate the additional analysis made by the authors to support their claims. While most of the
issues were sufficiently addressed in the improved version of the manuscript, I do have
remaining objection regarding the statistical analysis. Besides these two remarks I am

is a random walk with zero mean and unit variance. I interpret the reported p-value comparison
as showing that the r^2 of the sigmoidal is significantly better than the r^2 from the random walk
process. This corresponds to a rejection of the random walk process rather than a confirmation of
the sigmoidal curve. While such a comparison is also useful it does not support the claim that
"We thus find a robust statistical validation of the sigmoidal pattern" (p.5, line 121). In order to
claim this, one would have to assess what are the expected fluctuations from a sigmoidal curve
(with the same parameters) and check whether the observed fluctuations are compatible with the
expected fluctuations (i.e. failing to reject the sigmoidal hypothesis).
As a minor point regarding the comparison of the distributions of growth time and latency time.
The authors make a good argument that, indeed, the Inverse Gaussian provides the best fit
compared to other models (Exponential and Gaussian) by calculating the KL-divergence.
However, in order to allow for a fair comparison one should take into account that the models
possess a different number of parameters (1 for Exponential and 2 for Inverse Gaussian and
Gaussian). Standard approaches here are based on the Akaike or Bayesian Information Criterion.

The authors have carefully addressed all the points raised by the referees. The answers and the
manuscript contain now detailed discussions of different aspects from both data analysis and
theoretical modelling. Naturally, I do not fully agree with all arguments presented by the
authors. For instance, the new statistical analysis shows (at best) that the sigmoidal curve is better
than one (very naive) null model, while the text claims a "confirmation of the S-curve". That being
said, the new version of the manuscript is much more clear and provides all details so that
readers can judge by themselves the validity of the general claims. More importantly, altogether,
the paper makes important contributions to different aspects of the broad field of quantitative
analysis of language change. Therefore I believe the manuscript should be made available to a
larger audience without further delays and I recommend the publication of this manuscript as is.

I thank the authors for the careful response to all the issues that were raised by both referees. I
appreciate the additional analysis made by the authors to support their claims. While most of the
issues were sufficiently addressed in the improved version of the manuscript, I do have
remaining objection regarding the statistical analysis. Besides these two remarks I am
recommending the publication of the manuscript in Royal Society Open Science.
The null model considered by the authors to assess the statistical significance of the sigmoidal fit
is a random walk with zero mean and unit variance. I interpret the reported p-value comparison
as showing that the r^2 of the sigmoidal is significantly better than the r^2 from the random walk
process. This corresponds to a rejection of the random walk process rather than a confirmation of
the sigmoidal curve. While such a comparison is also useful it does not support the claim that
"We thus find a robust statistical validation of the sigmoidal pattern" (p.5, line 121). In order to
claim this, one would have to assess what are the expected fluctuations from a sigmoidal curve

Response to Referees
Feltgen Quentin, Fagard Benjamin & Nadal, Jean-Pierre
August 31, 2017
Dear Editor
We thank the referees for their useful comments. We tried to answer all of them, and
e that you will find the new version acceptable for publication in Royal Society Open
ence. We give below our detailed answers to the referees.
Yours, Sincerely,
Quentin Feltgen
ain changes
tried to make clearer that the paper presents two parts: the data analysis on one hand
the modeling on the other hand. The role of the first is to reconsider a popular claim in
linguistic literature, that of the frequent occurrence of an S-curve associated to a change
semantic use of an item. As such, the data analysis part is largely independent from
modeling part. The role of the latter is to provide a unified theoretical framework of
empirical phenomena, in line with Linguistics ideas. It allows also to predict additional
litative and quantitative features, such as the Inverse Gaussian-like distribution.
In the revised manuscript, as suggested by the referees, we propose a null model of
uency growth so as to assess the significance of the S-curve fit. However, we insist that
ually, there is no ‘natural’ null model to compare the sigmoidal fit with. Thus, the favored
l model is but one choice among the simplest possible random processes that could lead
similar data. However, different null models lead to closely similar p-values for the test
perform to estimate the quality of the sigmoidal fit, so that we believe it to be relevant
our analysis.
We also adjusted our criterion to select or reject the S-curve pattern for it to correspond to
same threshold of significance no matter the number of points. This led to a re-evaluation
1
ur data set. We also added, in Supporting Information, an extended discussion regarding
relevance of an Inverse Gaussian fit of the statistical distributions extracted from the
a. We now compare this fit with other relevant statistical distributions and provide a
ntitative argument, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, to justify why we favor
Inverse Gaussian.
We have also taken into account the references suggested by the reviewer and tried to
rify the relationship between the data analysis and the modeling aspects of our paper.
etailed answer to Reviewer 1
in point There was some misunderstanding concerning the links between the two parts
he paper (see above). We hope to have clarified this major point and we explain more,
e and in the paper, how the model outcomes can be confronted with the data.
(1) It is not clear to me how the mechanistic model and the fit of sigmoids relate to
h other. Can the sigmoid expression (6) be deduced from the model? What is the relation
ween the parameters of the sigmoid (xmin, xmax, h, b) and the ones of the model (N, beta,
a, etc.)?
The purpose of the model is threefold 1) to provide a theoretical unified framework of
empirical findings of our data analysis; 2) to capture qualitatively the latency + S-
wth pattern of frequency rise; 3) to reproduce the quantitative features of the statistical
tribution of the quantities extracted from corpus data. The objective 3) imposes the
del to be stochastic, so that, for a given set of model parameters, the model must be
e to generate patterns with different values of the rate, the width and the latency time.
erefore, the choice of the three parameters (M , ß d) is not associated with specific values
min , xmax , h and b (except that in the model xmax = 1 by construction), but with specific
tistical distributions of these values.
The comparison between the model and the data is therefore performed on the level of the
tributions, not on the level of individual processes. On the other hand, the deterministic
roximation of the model leads to a sigmoid with quantitative features that could be
puted, and which would correspond to the mean of the statistical distributions generated
the model. Also, the S-shaped of the growth is almost fed in the model, since we have
sen the production probability function P (f ) to be a hyperbolic tangent (i.e. a sigmoid),
as to meet several requirements that are detailed in the paper. The choice of a hyperbolic
gent is actually the simplest one. The relationship between the evolution of the frequency
roduced occurrences and the sigmoid is not trivial however. If we note G(x) the function:
Zx
du
G(x) = , (1)
P<U+03B3> (u) - u
0
n the frequency of produced occurrence is given in the deterministic approximation by
x(t)) = P (G-1 (t)) according to Eq. (4) of the paper. Therefore, the sigmoid that we
ain in the numerical process, even deterministic, is an idealization of this complicated
ction. Indeed, the sigmoidal fit of the surrogate numerical data is never perfect.
2
Inverse Gaussian distribution. The analysis based on the “inverse Gaussian fit” (Fig.
is not directly related to the S-curve part and I don’t see how it can validate it either
oreover, it is evident from Fig. 7 that a rigorous statistical test will reject the hypothesis
t the data follows the distribution).
ese remarks are correct, but not in contradiction with our aims and claims. First, the
l here is not to validate the existence of the S-curve. As explained above, the focus of
second part of the paper is on a plausible mechanism of language change, based on the
sting literature in Linguistics and compatible with the S-curve. And the model predicts
features that we test on the data.
Second, as was said in the original version of the manuscript, we do not expect the
erse Gaussian to be the exact distribution governing the statistics of the growth times
latency times, be it for the surrogate numerical data or for the data extracted from
Frantext corpus. Because the random walk process is complex, the distribution would
tainly be different, but because of the very nature of the process, we do expect this
tribution to be similar to the Inverse Gaussian. In the revised version (SI, section IC), we
w a comparison with other, standard distributions (Gaussian, exponential, Poisson and
xwellian distributions). It proves that the Inverse Gaussian fit is associated with a higher
lihood (equivalently, a lower Kullback-Leibler divergence). We also propose, in the SI,
ay to distinguish more convincingly the exponential and the Inverse Gaussian, if more
a were to be gathered (or if a finer timescale than the decade were to be used).
(2)The rationale behind the sigmoid fit is not clear to me
already said, the starting point is a well accepted, but not properly justified, claim in the
uistic literature. We recognize that such claim may appear strange for readers outside
s domain, but the Introduction of our paper tries to explain the status of the S-curve
e and why it matters to address it. The specific method that we used (fitting the logit
nsform of the data with a linear curve) is the standard one in the field since the 1980s. Our
was not to devise a new way to extract the quantitative features of an S-curve (though
s could be beneficial), but to perform this procedure on a whole new scale, considering
dreds of examples instead of just a few. Indeed, the S-curve is a pretty standard pattern
ll sorts of diffusion processes, and if we aim to come up with empirical observations more
cific to language change, we have to go beyond the fact that the frequency rises as an
urve.
In the paper, we claim to have succeeded in this regard in two major ways: first, by
ibiting a latency part, which we conjecture to be specific of semantic change; second,
obtaining the statistical distributions followed by these quantities (growth time, latency
e, slope of the logit). Also, many competing models and explanations have been proposed
account for the S-curve. The problem is, they all lead to an S-curve and they are therefore
ivalent when it comes to explain the available empirical evidence. By providing new kind
mpirical evidence, based on the statistics governing the features of the S-curve, we hope
t it will become possible to compare the models and the mechanisms of change more
ciently and to discuss their relevance with respect to these new observations.
Why is the fit done in the ”smoothed” dataset? In general this artificially reduces the
tuations.
e data are very noisy, not to say dirty. Fluctuations here come from many sources:
tuations in authors use of words, sample of texts present in the data base, etc. So we
3
want to reduce fluctuations, and to have enough data for each single points. A gliding
rage is a convenient way to do so and is a standard practice in the field of quantitative
pus linguistics.
I could not recover the linear relationship by inserting Eq. (6) in Eq. (5) (I recover it
y for xm in = 0). Please clarify.
typing the text we had forgotten a -xmin in the numerator. This had been fixed — but
computations had been done with the correct formula!
The least square fit assumes uniform Gaussian errors in the transformed variables. Why
his reasonable? I would expect that the errors in the estimation of the frequency should
end both on the frequency of the word and on the corpus size (that often vary dramati-
y over time). A rigorous statistical analysis should take the errors and fluctuations into
ount.
We fully agree with these remarks. We could have taken into account the fact that some
a points are more reliable than others by weighting them with the number of occurrences
he decade in the computation of a likelihood function. We actually tried to do so on a few
mples and did not find significant deviations from the r2 method. There are, furthermore,
additional arguments which should minimize the influence of this bias.
The first one is that we can compute the mean growth time and the mean slope for the
set of extracting changes starting in each of the seven centuries covered by our corpus
g. 1). If the corpus size has a significant influence on the growth and the slope parameters,
should therefore observe a change between the earlier centuries, with fewer texts, and the
r ones, with more texts.
As it appears, there are no significant changes from one century to another. The latest
turies may be associated with a smaller mean growth time and a larger mean slope, but
s is imputable to boundary effects (especially for the last century for which the width is
nded by 10).
The second argument is that the frequency is much more sensitive to heterogeneity of texts
he decade than it is to the total number of occurrences. For instance, the decade 1641-
0 and the decade 1801-1810 have similar sizes, but the latter is much more problematic
n the former since the gathered texts are mainly academic treatises. Therefore, the
mber of different authors, and the diversity of literary genres, is more crucial to the
ability of the frequency of a given form than the total amount of occurrences within a
ade.
The problem is, there is no obvious way to quantify this representativity of the subset of
ts within the decade. While it would be extremely interesting to weight the relevance of
h data point according to the quality of the decade, this cannot be done. Weighting the
a points with the quantity of occurrences of the decade is a possibility, but it would not
rove the data foraging significantly and the main problem would not be addressed.
The fit of the data is performed by first selecting the peak on the frequency.
is is not the case. As was explained in Materials & Methods, the selection of the pattern
ording to the following procedure: 1) identify a region of growth; 2) select all pairs of
ndaries in this domain separated by at least four points (so as not to perform a fit on
unsignificant number of data), and such that all data points are comprised between the
uencies two boundaries; 3) compute the linear fit of the logit transform of the rescaled
a between these two points; 4) if the fit is good enough (i.e. achieve a threshold of

turies of our corpus.
5
nificance associated with a p-value lower than 0.05), then keep it, and discard it otherwise;
elect the pairs associated with the highest number of data points; 6) among them, select
pair with the highest r2 .
Therefore, we did not select a priori the peaks in frequencies. The fact that the peak
he frequency is generally encompassed by the pattern in the selected pattern is due to
ditions 2), 4) and 5): all frequencies of the pattern have to be lower than the frequencies
he boundaries, the fit can be good only if the boundaries are well chosen, and the fact that
favor longer patterns makes easier to enroll the frequency peak in the pattern. Therefore,
t the peak is included is a result of the method and not a choice a priori.
The two crucial points of the method is a) to have a criterion so as to possibly reject a
tern; b) to have a way to extract the ‘best’ pattern (i.e. to optimize the choice of the
ndaries). Here the criterion is that the r2 of the linear fit is larger than a value depending
the number of points (see SI IA), and the ‘best’ pattern is the widest, and if there are
eral of them, the one associated with the best linear fit of the logit transform. Other ways
proceed would be possible as long as these two requirement are met.
From the sample in Fig. 1 it seems that the distributions are never stabilizing after the
k and that they have several peaks. It was not clear to me from the text how these features
tch with the proposed theoretical framework and mathematical model. If the increase in
uency is associated to semantic expansions, are the reductions in frequency related to
antic contractions? Furthermore, it seems to me that the choice to stop at the peak of
istribution favors the sigmoidal observation, at least at the end of the curve since the
ivative at the peak is by construction zero.
We did mention in the paper that the frequency is almost never stabilizing —which
prisingly seems to have been ignored so far in the literature on this topic. As stressed in
paper, we did not include the decrease part in the mathematical model. As it stands,
model would anyway be unable to account for this phenomenon. We do believe that it
uld require a significant extension to be integrated in the framework and this will be the
of future work.
Our model more specifically answers the question: why the frequency would rise accord-
to an S-curve preceded by a latency in a semantic expansion? However, the semantic
ansion is only a limited episode in the semantic life of a linguistic form and we can expect
uch wider arrays of behavior in frequency. We hope to be eventually able, by pursuing
ng this line, to relate the changes in frequency with semantic changes in a more system-
way. We do consider, therefore, that decrease in frequency would be associated with
antic contraction.
For additional reasons that could not be properly explained here, we can however expect
se semantic contractions not to mirror the semantic expansion (from a purely semantic
nt of view). Indeed, a semantic expansion is associated with a new meaning, which comes
new contexts of use. A semantic contraction on the other hand needs not be associated
h meaning change, but only with an impoverishment of contexts of use (the form becomes,
m a practical point of view, more specific). Think, for instance, to notwithstanding, which
ssociated with a decrease of frequency in the two last centuries. Its overall meaning did
change, but it cannot be uttered as casually and pervasively as it used to be.

etailed answer to Reviewer 2
e threefold view of language as a social convention, a cognitive entity, and an autonomous
tem, may not be classical, but is rather consensual. First, these three views correspond
different fields: Sociolinguistics for the first, Cognitive Linguistics, Psycholinguistics and
urolinguistics for the second, Diachronic Linguistics and Formal Linguistics for the third.
s also reminiscent of Labov’s Principles of Linguistic Change, divided into the three
umes Internal factors, Social factors and Cognitive and Cultural factors. Our distinction
s not exactly overlap with this tripartition, but clearly these ideas are common and to
e extent agreed upon. In short, our threefold separation reflects our personal opinion,
does not constitute an unorthodox view on this matter.
Abstract
are well aware that the S-curve has already been extracted and discussed from a quan-
tive point of view, starting with the work of Piotrovskaja, A., & Piotrovskij, R. (1974),
pursued in Altmann, G., et al. (1983), who first proposed to use a linear fit of the logit
nsform to obtain and discuss the S-curve. We only meant that our own investigation on
matter is performed on an unprecedented scale. To dispel this confusion, we replaced
antitative’ by ‘large-scale’ in the abstract. Notably, it seems that we are the first to in-
tigate the statistical distributions of these quantities. We consider this to be one of the
jor contributions of our paper.
We also thank the referee for the additional references. The one by Ghanbarnejad et
was already quoted in the paper but we further highlighted it, since it is assuredly an
eresting and important contribution to the S-curve topic. We did not retain the reference
Vulanovic & Baayen (2007), since it is mainly a re-evaluation of corpus data already
estigated by Kroch (1989), which we quote in the paper. The main contribution of
anovic & Baayen (2007) is to fit the logit transform of the data provided in Ellega°rd
53) with a four-degree polynomial instead of a linear function. Such extensions of the
urve pattern were also discussed by Best et al. (1990), that we quote in the revised
sion of the manuscript, and by [Kallel, The loss of negative concord in Standard English:
ernal factors, Language Variation and Change (2007)]. We were not aware of the work
Bentley et al. and we now briefly discuss it in the revised version of the manuscript.
Selection of studied forms
e issue of selecting the forms is indeed important, and one would be glad to have a
tematic way to do it. The chosen forms do not come from any preexisting list. They have
n chosen according to the linguistic expertise of one of the authors, which is one of the
sons why this work needs to be the result of an interdisciplinary collaboration.
7
Statistical Analysis of Sigmoidal curves
especially try to address this issue in the revised version of the manuscript. We proposed
ull model so as to assess the significance of the sigmoid pattern as compared to a random
cess of frequency growth. The data was re-evaluated so that the criterion to select or
ct the patterns corresponds now to the same threshold of significance no matter the
mber of points (equivalent to a p-value inferior to 0.05). The null model is a biased
dom walk with Gaussian steps.
As for Eq.(6), in typing the text we had forgotten a -xmin in the numerator. This had
n fixed - but the computations had been done with the correct formulae!
Latency period
e percentage of sigmoids preceded by a latency period was already given in the Materials
Methods. As this is indeed an important statement, we added it in the main body of
paper. There is therefore a latency in 69% of cases.
Modeling
tried to explain further why a competition between two linguistics items is the standard
e. First, the two competitors need not be individual items. They can be a schema, or a set
inguistic items. For instance, in French, there is a famous case of negation replacement:
usual ne was replaced, in the Middle Ages, by different competitors: ne pas, ne point,
mie, ne goutte, etc. However, this competition is best seen as a competition between two
ation schemes, a standard, simple one, and an emphatic one with a lexical word. It is
y later on that these emphatic constructions start to compete against each other, usually
pecific contexts, involving two of them at the same time.
Also, a form can seem to have no competitor at all. We argue that in this case, it might be
t the ‘convention’ occupies a large semantic dominion. Since the competition occurs only
the border of this domain, the use of the convention is almost unaffected by the change.
a rule, the competition is usually very localized in a given context of use. Since this
text is highly specific, it is much unlikely that there would be more than two competitors
a time. Our model describes thus such a localized competition, specifically.
It entails two things. First, the empirical study of semantic change would benefit from
restriction to more specific contexts. However, one must find a trade-off between data
ilability (if the context is too specific, data is too scarce and unreliable) and context-
cificity. By investigated mostly complex, but idiomatic constructions, we tried to balance
se two issues. Second, to account for semantic change, the model should be expanded to
hole network of contexts, instead of being limited to a two-sites situation. This we hope
nvestigate in future work.
To complete our answer to the point raised by the referee, we admit that we consider
t the overall frequency of forms in language is constant. That is, the frequency of a
m cannot increase if the frequency of another form does not decrease. This assumption is
sonable, and is in line with the well-known Zipf’s law, according to which linguistic forms
ranked according to their frequency so that the frequency is inversely proportional to

Numerical Results
e critical couple (<U+03B3>c , xc ) depends on the value of ß. Surprisingly, xc is a non-monotonic
ction of ß and admits a maximum in a single value of ß. We therefore choose this value
for our simulations. It seemed a good choice, first because it is the only value of ß where
ething significant is to be observed, second, because synonymic alternation is a desirable
ture of language. If the outcome of a competition is the total domination of either one or
other form, then there would not be room for synonymic alternation. However, if we are
ow the threshold <U+03B3>c and if xc is high enough, then the new form can be marginally used,
hout evicting the convention. A co-existence of two forms is thus possible, with a strong
alance in favor of the most usual one. Maximizing xc was therefore a way to safeguard
possibility of a limited synonymic alternation in our model. We added a few lines in the
er to clarify this matter.
Confrontation with corpus
erse Gaussian As was said in the first version, we do not expect the Inverse Gaussian
be the exact distribution. Because the random walk process is complex, the distribution
ertainly different, but because of the very nature of the process, we do expect this
tribution to be close to the inverse Gaussian. In the revised version (SI, section IC),
show the comparison with other, simple distributions.
It turns out that the Inverse Gaussian fit is associated with a higher likelihood (equiv-
ntly, a lower Kullback-Leibler divergence), so that the data is more likely to have been
erated by a function of this type than by a Gaussian, an exponential, a Poisson or a
xwellian. We also propose, in the SI (same section), a way to distinguish more convinc-
ly the exponential and the Inverse Gaussian, if more data were to be gathered (or if a
r timescale than the decade were to be used).
tency. As for how the latency was extracted, this was already detailed in Materials &
thods. The idea is to consider that the latency holds (in a backwards perspective) as long
the frequency stays within an interval defined by xm in ± a * (xmax - xmin ), where a is an
itrary parameter that we set to 0.15. The inconvenient of this method is that it depends
features of the growth part and there may be better ways to extract latency.
Discussion
e ‘saturating’ scaling exponent of -1.4 appeared to have been an artifact of our former data
vey and was not be found in the new data survey (based on an harmonized significance
eshold for the r2 of the linear fit). However, in both cases, fitting the mean slope for
h growth value by a linear curve led to an exponent of -1. This corresponds to the trivial
ue expected from a sigmoid. In any case, we do not find the scaling law found in social
usion of technological goods or behavioral norms. We agree that it does not rule out the
9
sibility for the data to be chiefly explained by a social diffusion of the form. Our point is
her to argue that the diffusion can be cognitive and motivated by semantic associations,
we argued in the paper. We therefore try to justify an alternative hypothesis, rather than
condemn an existing one.
We can imagine various ways to distinguish the two. Especially, if we track the linguistic
its of an individual over its life and find the same kind of frequency evolution in its
lect, it would be a strong argument in favor of a cognitive diffusion. In any way, the
ial diffusion of the form does happen and is obviously necessary. We do believe, however,
t it unfolds on shorter time scales. This matter remains to be investigated further on.
Minor points
corrected the typos signaled by the reviewer and are thankful for this. The figures have
been replaced so as to add axis labels. Since Open Science is an electronic journal, it
uld be possible to zoom in if some numbers cannot be read at first glance. We provided
h definition figures to allow so. We also insured that the most relevant numbers (such as
parameters value of the fit) could be read without difficulty.

Dear Editor,
We thank the referees for their positive reception of the revised version, and for their
itional comments. We detail below the revisions made in order to respond to these new
arks. Actually, the manuscript itself has not been modified, since all the revisions asked
by the referees were related to the Supplementary Material.
Yours, Sincerely,
Quentin Feltgen
pected fluctuations and robustness of the S-curve
e referees have stressed that the analysis we provided in the last revision only shows that
null model we had chosen cannot account for the data, but does not tell anything on the
ustness of the S-curve fit itself. Therefore, assuming the datapoints were generated, for
h studied form, for each decade, by a sampling of a probability given by the S-curve, we
d to provide an estimate of the expected deviations from the predicted frequency. To do
we computed the confidence interval within which the frequency must fall, so as to be
sistent with the sigmoidal probability. The range of this interval is given by the standard
iation: s
ft (1 - ft )
1.96 , (1)
Nt
ere ft is the expected frequency from the S-curve fit and Nt the number of occurrences
ociated with this decade (actually replaced by an effective number of occurrences, as
lained in Supplementary Material section I.A.3).
For each extracted pattern, we checked that all data points were falling within this interval
confidence. This was the case for 86 % of our S-curves. It must be stressed that these

tuations estimate amounts to consider that the source of fluctuation comes only from
finite size of the sample on which the frequency of occurrence of the forms is computed.
, there are other source of fluctuations, such as the inhomogeneity of the corpus for
h decade (different literary genres, different authors, different language registers, are not
ally represented). In this regard, 86 % of patterns statistically consistent with the S-curve
be considered as a very good score. We provided the result of the check for each pattern
our list of forms (Supplementary material section III D).
We hope that this further test will be accepted as a support for our claim that the S-curve
ndeed an established template of language change, as has been claimed in the literature
long. We want indeed to remind that it was not the chief goal of our paper to prove this
nt, since the consensus regarding the pervasiveness of the S-curve in events of language
nge is already well-grounded in the field of Diachronic Linguistics.

ich we were glad to comply. The results of both tests concur with the previous conclusion
t the Inverse Gaussian fit, among the different distributions we tried on, accounts best
the statistical distributions of the growth and latency times. s
