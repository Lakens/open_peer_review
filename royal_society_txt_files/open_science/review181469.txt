phthalate ester and bromodiphenyl ether, which is possible be used for screening analysis of
RoHS. This paper could be accepted for publication after the following revision. Major concerns:
(1) the method should be verified by real samples, how about the matrix effect? whether other
hazardous substances, such as VOCs and SVOCs affect the quantitation of PAEs? (2) The data

Appendix A
Point1: Certified values for concentrations of the respective PhEs in the powder
reference materials from SPEX CertiPrep are shown in Table 3. Calibration curves
obtained by using these reference materials are shown in Fig. 4.
Query 1: As per Table -3 the certified reference material values are around 1000
mg/kg (ppm) for DIBP, BBP and DEHP but in Fig.4 the calibration range of above
standards are 250 to 1500 µg/g (ppm). Reasoning is necessary.
Point 2. The above three samples were analyzed by our new screening analysis
method. Because DEHP and DNOP have identical mass numbers as stated above, the
combined amount was spectrally evaluated. The calibration curves shown in Fig. 4
were used for evaluation, and the measurement was repeated 6 times for the
respective samples. The obtained results of quantitative analysis as well as the
repeatability (CV value) are shown in Table 5.
Query 2: In Fig.4 the calibration curve range 250 to 1500 µg/g (ppm). But in the
Table.5 the repeatability results are more than calibration range. As per
quantification rule the results are within the calibration range.
Query 3: In Fig.2 shows the Thermal desorption peak profile of SIM mode
measurement of DBP, BBP & DEHP. But there is no Thermal desorption peak of DBDE
observed.
Query 3: In Fig.4 the calibration curves of DBP, BBP & DEHP prepared using powder
reference material. But there is no calibration a curve of DBDE was observed even
though the reference material was available. (As you mentioned in manuscript).
Needs reasoning and explanation of the above points.

hank you very much for helping us review the paper entitled “Screening analysis of RoHS Directive hazardous
bstances (Phthalate esters and Bromodiphenyl ether) by novel mass spectrometry using soft ionization.”
We are submitting this revised manuscript after considering the suggestions made by two reviewers.
swer to the respective reviewers and major changes we have made are follows.
sponse to Reviewer: 1
swer for major concerns:
the method should be verified by real samples, how about the matrix effect? whether other hazardous substances,
such as VOCs and SVOCs affect the quantitation of PAEs?
<U+2192> As you say, this method requires verification on actual samples, and we are currently conducting
measurements on some samples. However, since the purpose of this paper is to evaluate whether or not the
developed apparatus can detect phthalate esters to a minimum, we verified by using two popular samples with
known concentrations.
We have to consider the effect of the matrix as you say (that is, the difference in accuracy of measurement
data due to matrix material). Also, VOCs and SVOCs are also a big issue, and some SVOCs contain PhEs in
particular, and they are considered as the target application of this system. In this paper, we kept in mind that
we urgently announce the equipment that can apply to the new RoHS2. In the paper, as a representative
sample, we made a sample containing PhEs in polyethylene matrix. We used this sample to evaluate the
analytical performance of the apparatus (the second paragraph of section 4-2). In addition, we prepared
samples containing several concentrations of PhEs in PVC and verified the quantitative range for screening
analysis (section 4-3).
We will also verify the versatility by acquiring the data on the effects of various other matrix substances, so
please wait for the paper that we will write in the near future.
The data points for calibration curves shown in figure 4 is too small to get a reliable fitting
<U+2192> As you know, fitting with several specimens with different concentrations makes it possible to perform
highly reliable quantitative analysis. However, the aim of this paper is to verify the equipment related to
screening analysis aimed at rapid analysis.
Since the probability in the vicinity of the PhE concentration of 1,000 µg/g, which is the target of the threshold
in RoHS2 screening analysis, is the most important, Fig.4 simply shows the calibration curve obtained with
1000 µg/g PhEs concentration of SPEX standard substance. Of course, in case of detailed quantitative
analysis a calibration curve consisting of two points is insufficient, but from the viewpoint of rapid screening
analysis it was used.
The most important point that you say is that the axis range is different from the actual calibration range,
and I agree with you that it is difficult to recognize using the standard substance in Table 3. In order to clarify
the standard substance concentration and calibration range used in this research, we have to replace Fig.4.
Also, the rest are supplementary. Regarding the method of screening analysis of RoHS2 using standard
bstance of only 1000 µg/g concentration, it is described as the method prescribed in "Screening analysis of
hEs by Py/DT-GC-MS" in the International standard document of IEC 62321 – 8. And I also experimented
ith those method in this paper. Then, I also added to the text of this paper about what I mentioned here.
hat is relationship between the calibration curves shown in figure 4 and figure 5.
Although we mentioned a little more in the above, Fig.4 is a calibration curve prepared using SPEX's
owder standard substance. Simply verified whether DBP, BBP, DEHP containing substances in the vicinity of
e target concentration can be detected (described at first line at 4-2). Furthermore, we prepared a sample
r evaluation in which PhEs with concentrations of 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 µg/g were contained in the PVC
sin matrix. Fig.5 shows the correlation between each analytical value obtained by our apparatus and the
tual concentration. (Described in 4-3). The notation of "Calibration curve" is not suitable for this content, so
hanged the caption of the figure.
er for minor concerns:
e author should cite more literature papers on direct mass spectrometry analysis method using ambient ionization
ethod;
Surely it is. We have increased cited references of direct mass spectroscopy analysis, a technique relatively
ose to the method of this paper, which was used for reference when developing the paper content.
gure 7 and Figure 8 are not necessary, as the isotope pattern agreements tell nothing but the molecular assignments
Thank you very much for your suggestion. As you say, Fig.7 concludes that it is unnecessary because it
nly spectrally patterns the number of 81Br, precise mass number, and relative abundance of DBDE. On the
her hand, Fig.8 shows the meaningful correlation (coincidence) between the spectral pattern obtained by
easuring the actual DBDE-containing polystyrene standard substance and the theoretical spectrum pattern
r discriminating the abundance ratio of DBDE, and Fig.8 proves that the spectrum of the actual DBDE
andard is highly correlated with the spectra obtained by discriminating compounds by measuring isotopic
tios of bromine.
s a result of considering the above, Fig. 7 was deleted according to your advice.

int1: Certified values for concentrations of the respective PhEs in the powder reference materials from
EX CertiPrep are shown in Table 3. Calibration curves obtained by using these reference materials are
own in Fig. 4.
uery 1: As per Table -3 the certified reference material values are around 1000 mg/kg (ppm) for DIBP,
P and DEHP but in Fig.4 the calibration range of above standards are 250 to 1500 µg/g (ppm).
asoning is necessary.
<U+2192> Fig.4 is a calibration curve prepared using SPEX's powder standard substance (Table 3). Simply
verified whether DBP, BBP, DEHP containing substances in the vicinity of the target concentration can be
detected (described in the first line of 4-2). However, as you recognized, it is difficult to recognize using
the standard substance in Table 3. It does not reflect the calibration range actually used and it might be
difficult to understand, therefore, Fig.4 was replaced in order to clarify that we used the concentration
using the standard substance listed in Table 3 and calibration range.
On the other hand, we also prepared samples for evaluation in which PhEs with concentrations of 500,
1000, 1500 and 2000 µg/g were obtained in PVC resin matrix. Fig.5 shows the correlation between each
analytical value of these samples and the actual concentration (as described in 4-3). Also, because the
notation of "Calibration curve" is not suitable for this content, we changed the figure caption to
"Correlation between ...".
int 2. The above three samples were analyzed by our new screening analysis method. Because DEHP
d DNOP have identical mass numbers as stated above, the combined amount was spectrally evaluated.
e calibration curves shown in Fig. 4 were used for evaluation, and the measurement was repeated 6
mes for the respective samples. The obtained results of quantitative analysis as well as the repeatability
V value) are shown in Table 5.
uery 2: In Fig.4 the calibration curve range 250 to 1500 µg/g (ppm). But in the Table.5 the repeatability
sults are more than calibration range. As per quantification rule the results are within the calibration
nge.
<U+2192> It is also common to your Query 1, and everything depends on the ineligibility of Fig.4. With the
replacement in Fig.4, half of the doubt was solved.
In addition, in this study we use a standard substance of 1000 µg / g and I can understand your
perception that it is different from the multipoint calibration curve of the usual calibration curve method.
However, this study treated this calibration curve because it maintained two of (1) verification with a
minimum process to respond to rapid analysis, (2) conforming to international standards method.
Supplementary explanation for (2) above is as follows. As a regulation method of PhEs screening
analysis by Py/TD-GC-MS described in International Standard of IEC 62321-8, Blank sample is used for
"Check contamination and carry over" verification, 100 mg/kg standard substance for " check the
sensitivity ", and it stipulates that 1000 mg / kg standard substance is used for" Calibration ". And in this
regulation, standardized to screen analysis of PhEs at 500 - 2000 mg/kg using standard substances of
this concentration. In this research, we carried out the process according to this method. We accepted
your proposal and judged that above explanation is necessary in the text, then added it in the text of 4-2.
uery 3: In Fig.2 shows the Thermal desorption peak profile of SIM mode measurement of DBP, BBP &
EHP. But there is no Thermal desorption peak of DBDE observed.
uery 4: In Fig.4 the calibration curves of DBP, BBP & DEHP prepared using powder reference material.
ut there is no calibration a curve of DBDE was observed even though the reference material was
ailable. (As you mentioned in manuscript).
<U+2192> We answer both Query 3 and Query 4 together.
Fig.2 shows the measurement results of DBP, BBP and DEHP contained samples, which are not
detected because DBDE do not contain.
In this research, we conducted the following evaluations in order using our new apparatus. (1)
Investigation of the detectability of DBP, BBP, and DEHP (Detectable, how short the measurement
time, usability of the calibration curve). (2) respective DBP + DIBP, BBP, and DEHP + DNOP were
prepared in PE matrix, and the effectiveness of the apparatus for analysis of these samples was
evaluated, (3) We prepare samples of respective DBP, BBP, and DEHP containing 500, 1000, 1500
and 2000 µg/g in PVC and investigated the correlation between analysis results and the prepared
concentration values, (4) Investigation of the extensibility of our analysis subjects ( In the present
study, since bromodiphenyl ethers is also subject to regulation in RoHS2, confirm whether this
substance can be detected).
Therefore, for DBDE related to (4), theoretical proposal was made to evaluate whether there is
detection capability (qualitative analysis) and quantitative discrimination, and quantitative evaluation by
the calibration curve method, such as shown in Fig.4 using different concentrations of DBDEs, was not
carried out.
However, here we show that several spectral DBDE patterns can be obtained within 15 minutes, and
furthermore we found that it has a high correlation between the theoretical spectral patterns and the
measurement spectral patterns, as a result of the theoretical quantitative discrimination by measuring
the standard substance of DBDE containing polystyrene.
The reason of our using standard material of polystyrene containing DBDE was important to use a
target sample clearly known to contain a certain amount of DBDE.
However, here we show that several spectral DBDE patterns can be obtained within 15 minutes, and
furthermore we found that it has a high correlation between the theoretical spectral patterns and the
measured spectral patterns, which theoretical patterns were obtained as a result of the theoretical
quantitative discrimination by measuring the standard substance of DBDE containing polystyrene.
According your suggestion, we described the process (1) - (4) above mentioned as an outline at the
beginning of "Materials and Methods", in order to avoid confusion between the various experimental
processes mentioned above and the description of the result.
