The contribution by Tietje and Rödel investigates the influence of habitat type on taxon duration
in amphibians. The authors specifically examine whether species living in flowing (lotic) waters
persist longer than species living in stagnant (lentic) waters. The study focuses on one of the most
threatened groups of terrestrial vertebrates, amphibians, and raises the interesting possibility that
a once favourable strategy (living in lotic waters) is now unfavorable as a result of anthropogenic
influence. While the paper may be of broad interest to ecologists, conservationists, and
herpetologists, I have a number of concerns regarding its current form, which I detail below.
1) The manuscript should be thoroughly revised for English usage by a native speaker. The
prose was difficult to follow, and there were numerous typos (line 368, for example, which has
two periods). Additionally, on line 48 the authors include a parenthetical in German.
2) I’d like more detail on how each species was categorized into energetic regime/habitat.
The authors state this was done by lithological context, and more specifically by assigning
different lithologies to habitat categories. However, I did not see the relationship between the
lithology and habitat categories explicated anywhere. It’s difficult to assess the robustness of their
analyses if this basic information is not provided.
3) Were any corrections done to account for the fact that amphibian fossils from higher-
energy environments may be allocthonous and not autocthonous? The greater degree of
transport, particularly in high-energy environments, may contribute to the greater degree of
incomplete preservation of these fossils.
4) The authors suggest that IF more complete specimens are found in low-energy habitats,
it would result in shortened overall species durations for these habitats. They use this line of
reasoning to argue that since the opposite pattern is found – i.e., durations are longer in lotic
habitats -- taphonomic biases are not controlling observed duration patterns. However, I am not
sure I agree with this reasoning, as it seems that a better ability to preserve specimens may
actually result in longer taxon durations, rather than shorter taxon durations. How would the
authors distinguish between these two plausible scenarios? Perhaps some sort of simulation
analysis is warranted?
5) The authors expend a significant amount of ink discussing the occurrence of single-bin
duration species. They do not, however, test the effect that these taxa on the duration patterns of
lentic versus lotic taxa. I would like to see whether the pattern holds if these taxa are excluded
from analyses. Importantly, single-interval species did occur more often in low energetic habitats,
which may be biasing their results.
6) The authors considered geographic range, and calculated range size as the number of
occupied cells in a 2x2 decimal degree grid. To compare range sizes across habitats, however, the
authors should normalize or standardize by the amount of ‘preservable’ area (i.e., where a fossil
can be found) available to a species in these habitats. Have the authors considered dividing their
occupancy metric by the total number of grid cells that contain fossils from each stage/location?
7) The authors are interested in the relative role of habitat type and geographic range size
on taxon duration, but they do not perform any analyses to tease apart these two factors. Indeed,
the authors note themselves that “we cannot exclude the possibility that parts of the duration
pattern might be caused by geographic range size” (lines 413-414). To better exclude this
possibility, the authors could examine similarly-sized geographic ranges in both water categories,
and assess whether durations still differ significantly when controlling for range size. Moreover,
the authors could perform some sort of multivariate analysis that examines the strength of effect
of these different factors (see, for example, Finnegan et al. 2015 Science or Saupe et al. 2015 GEB).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors presented a rigorous analysis showing that the relationship between habitat type and
extinction risk in fossil amphibians is the opposite of what it is today. Moreover the results
cannot be explained by potential preservational or phylogenetic biases. The authors hinted that
this difference may be related to an anthropogenic influence, but do not (I think) adequately
develop this important idea further. As it is now, this important conclusion is only discussed
between lines 450 and 460 at the end of the Discussion section. While any inferences on this issue
might be speculative at this point, I think it is worth exploring the idea. For instance, the authors
speculate that habitat destruction and/or alteration of lotic habitats today might have put species
utilizing them at risk. How might this work? In short, the authors present a battery of tests to
convince the reader that there is a difference between fossil and modern amphibians (which is
commendable), but the manuscript comes up short by not following through with the
implications of the study’s main result. Perhaps even more than the example above, the last
sentence of the discussion (lines 461-462) begs to be developed further. What are the implications
if fossil trait relationships conflict with those estimated for living species? What does it mean for
our attempt to use information from the past to inform our conservation decisions (i.e. the
conservation paleobiological approach) if the Anthropocene world we live in is a different than
the past? Stating that they are in conflict (as the last sentence currently concludes the paper) is
only the first step. The introduction of the paper made an explicit point that we needed to test
whether “targeted traits are valid in extinction risk assessments” (lines 38-39). The authors seem
to miss an opportunity to draw broader conclusions from their study by not following through
and discussing what it means for amphibian conservation if the targeted traits turned out not be
valid, which I would presume they would conclude given how the paper was set up. Also,
although I generally agree with the authors’ interpretations, I wonder if more discussion should
be devoted to the potential effect of geographic range size, which the authors suggest might have
produced a similar pattern (lines 408-409; also figure S3). It seems here that a more detailed
discussion of the traits permitting species to live in lotic versus lentic habitats might be useful,
especially if they are organismic level properties and not aggregate species-level properties.

I commend the authors for performing many of the suggested analyses, including examining
similarly-sized geographic ranges in both water categories to assess whether their durations still

differ significantly when controlling for range size. The authors thoroughly addressed most of
my concerns with their manuscript, and I just have a few remaining points, detailed below.
1. The authors analyzed the data without singleton taxa and found no significant
differences. I understand the authors performed analyses to test the robustness of the singleton
taxa, but I still think it would be useful for readers to know that the results do not hold if
singletons are removed. The results could be presented in the supplementary materials.
2. In their section on taphonomic biases, the authors note that the condition of specimens
was not available for all taxa, and thus respective samples of occurrences from each environment
were used. However, no mention is made of sample size here; perhaps it should be added for
enhanced clarity (lines 167-169)?
3. I am still a confused about the assignment of lithologies to habitat. Couldn’t a marl or
siltstone also represent a lentic habitat?

Point-by-point rebuttal
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The contribution by Tietje and Rödel investigates the influence of habitat type on taxon duration in
amphibians. The authors specifically examine whether species living in flowing (lotic) waters persist
longer than species living in stagnant (lentic) waters. The study focuses on one of the most
threatened groups of terrestrial vertebrates, amphibians, and raises the interesting possibility that a
once favourable strategy (living in lotic waters) is now unfavourable as a result of anthropogenic
influence. While the paper may be of broad interest to ecologists, conservationists, and
herpetologists, I have a number of concerns regarding its current form, which I detail below.
1) The manuscript should be thoroughly revised for English usage by a native speaker. The prose was
difficult to follow, and there were numerous typos (line 368, for example, which has two periods).
Additionally, on line 48 the authors include a parenthetical in German.
RESPONSE: We have carefully revised the manuscript and corrected the outlined typos and mistakes.
With the help of a native English speaker, a colleague at our institution, we performed a thorough
language check to enhance readability. The native English speaker is now included in the
acknowledgement.
2) I’d like more detail on how each species was categorized into energetic regime/habitat. The
authors state this was done by lithological context, and more specifically by assigning different
lithologies to habitat categories. However, I did not see the relationship between the lithology and
habitat categories explicated anywhere. It’s difficult to assess the robustness of their analyses if this
basic information is not provided.
RESPONSE: The habitat category assignment was rephrased and clarified in the main text in lines
183ff.
3) Were any corrections done to account for the fact that amphibian fossils from higher-energy
environments may be allocthonous and not autocthonous? The greater degree of transport,
particularly in high-energy environments, may contribute to the greater degree of incomplete
preservation of these fossils.
RESPONSE: The reviewer is concerned about whether amphibian fossils especially from high-energy
environments actually lived in this environment, or whether secondary transportation lead to
redeposition, which could affect the habitat assignment of the species. While we as well considered
this potential problem while preparing the manuscript, we found that according to Kidwell 1996 [1],
transport out of the original habitat very rarely occurs, and that even downstream transport is
limited as indicated by field experiments. Therefore, we do not think our data is biased by secondary
depositional effects. However, as we understand that this point is of potential interest for readers, we
address this question now prominently in the discussion in lines 421ff.
4) The authors suggest that IF more complete specimens are found in low-energy habitats, it would
result in shortened overall species durations for these habitats. They use this line of reasoning to
argue that since the opposite pattern is found – i.e., durations are longer in lotic habitats --
taphonomic biases are not controlling observed duration patterns. However, I am not sure I agree
with this reasoning, as it seems that a better ability to preserve specimens may actually result in
longer taxon durations, rather than shorter taxon durations. How would the authors distinguish
between these two plausible scenarios? Perhaps some sort of simulation analysis is warranted?
RESPONSE: The reviewer suggests that the higher preservation probability in lentic habitats might
result in longer taxon duration, when we initially hypothesized in the Methods section that an
increased preservation of rare and fragile species would result in a lower overall duration. We thank
the reviewer for this helpful comment.
ACTION: We have revised our initial hypothesis in the Methods section (lines 166ff) to match the
assumption that low preservation probability in high-energy habitats results in truncated taxon
durations. However, we regard both scenarios to be reasonable and assume that the effect of
preservation bias on taxon duration might ultimately depend on the morphological composition of
the respective fauna. We added a new part discussing both possibilities (lines 393ff).
5) The authors expend a significant amount of ink discussing the occurrence of single-bin duration
species. They do not, however, test the effect that these taxa on the duration patterns of lentic
versus lotic taxa. I would like to see whether the pattern holds if these taxa are excluded from
analyses. Importantly, single-interval species did occur more often in low energetic habitats, which
may be biasing their results.
RESPONSE: The reviewer suggests testing for the effect of single-interval species on the duration
pattern between low and high-energy habitats. We ran the analysis again without single-interval
taxa and tested for differences in duration between all habitat categories. This analysis shows a
vanishing pattern with no significant differences between groups (see figure below, Kruskal-Wallis
rank sum test: p> 0.05 for all three levels), which is not surprising given the strongly reduced sample
sizes.
Figure: Durations of amphibian single-interval species in different environments. Species were
grouped into four basic (level 1) and two broader environmental categories (level 2 and 3; compare
Figure 1 in the manuscript. Sample sizes for groups were: stagnant (30), low-velocity (29), medium-
velocity (21), high-velocity (4); lentic (30) and lotic (38); low (42) and high (24).
Excluding single-interval species resulted in the loss of 87% of our data, which reduced sample size
for each habitat category drastically. We argue that we assessed the credibility of the short-lived
species in the first part of the manuscript and tested for their potential influence by analysing their
distribution across habitat categories (line 331ff). We concluded that we do not see a reason to
mistrust the short-lived species. We are aware that excluding single-interval species is common
practice in quantitative palaeontological analysis, however we argue that for our dataset the
resulting loss in biodiversity and sample size would pose a greater bias to the results than occasional
false single-interval species would do.
6) The authors considered geographic range, and calculated range size as the number of occupied
cells in a 2x2 decimal degree grid. To compare range sizes across habitats, however, the authors
should normalize or standardize by the amount of ‘preservable’ area (i.e., where a fossil can be
found) available to a species in these habitats. Have the authors considered dividing their occupancy
metric by the total number of grid cells that contain fossils from each stage/location?
RESPONSE: The reviewer suggests a standardization procedure of the geographic range size based on
the size of the potentially available habitat. From our understanding, scaling for preservable area
would require the knowledge of the limnology of every terrestrial habitat over the last 300 million
years, which is hardly possible. However, we checked the suggested standardization by dividing our
occupancy metric (number of grid cells) by the total number of occupied grid cells per geologic stage.
The resulting metric shows a strong influence of the number of species found per geologic stage,
which varies heavily and influences the number of occupied grid cells. This leads to high standardized
values for species that occur in a single grid cell, but are the only species recorded in the time unit,
whereas widely distributed species that happen to occur with lots of other species in their time
interval appear to have smaller distributions. This effect remains when applying log transformation
prior to standardization as suggested by Finnegan et al. 2015 [2]. As number of grid cells is strongly
correlated with other measures like latitudinal range and great circle distance (see supplement
geo_calculations.R), but the standardized values are not well correlated, we believe the original
number of grid cells is a more valid representation of the geographic range size for our data.
7) The authors are interested in the relative role of habitat type and geographic range size on taxon
duration, but they do not perform any analyses to tease apart these two factors. Indeed, the authors
note themselves that “we cannot exclude the possibility that parts of the duration pattern might be
caused by geographic range size” (lines 413-414). To better exclude this possibility, the authors could
examine similarly-sized geographic ranges in both water categories, and assess whether durations
still differ significantly when controlling for range size. Moreover, the authors could perform some
sort of multivariate analysis that examines the strength of effect of these different factors (see, for
example, Finnegan et al. 2015 Science or Saupe et al. 2015 GEB).
RESPONSE: We agree with the reviewer that this additional analysis would add to the understanding
of the results by untangling the geographic range size-habitat relationship.
ACTION: We performed the required analysis and report the results in lines 329ff as well as more
detailed in supplement table S12 (revised supplement). The results support our analysis by showing
that geographic range alone cannot be the reason for the observed duration pattern between
habitats.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors presented a rigorous analysis showing that the relationship between habitat type and
extinction risk in fossil amphibians is the opposite of what it is today. Moreover the results cannot be
explained by potential preservational or phylogenetic biases. The authors hinted that this difference
may be related to an anthropogenic influence, but do not (I think) adequately develop this important
idea further. As it is now, this important conclusion is only discussed between lines 450 and 460 at
the end of the Discussion section. While any inferences on this issue might be speculative at this
point, I think it is worth exploring the idea. For instance, the authors speculate that habitat
destruction and/or alteration of lotic habitats today might have put species utilizing them at risk.
How might this work?
RESPONSE: The reviewer suggests discussing the possible mechanisms of our suggested
anthropogenic influence in more detail. We thank the reviewer for this helpful comment and gladly
pick up this point in our manuscript.
ACTION: We explored this idea further by adding examples of how anthropogenic influence acts
especially on the amphibian fauna associated with rivers. This is included in lines 493ff of the
discussion.
In short, the authors present a battery of tests to convince the reader that there is a difference
between fossil and modern amphibians (which is commendable), but the manuscript comes up short
by not following through with the implications of the study’s main result. Perhaps even more than
the example above, the last sentence of the discussion (lines 461-462) begs to be developed further.
What are the implications if fossil trait relationships conflict with those estimated for living species?
What does it mean for our attempt to use information from the past to inform our conservation
decisions (i.e. the conservation paleobiological approach) if the Anthropocene world we live in is a
different than the past? Stating that they are in conflict (as the last sentence currently concludes the
paper) is only the first step. The introduction of the paper made an explicit point that we needed to
test whether “targeted traits are valid in extinction risk assessments” (lines 38-39). The authors
seem to miss an opportunity to draw broader conclusions from their study by not following through
and discussing what it means for amphibian conservation if the targeted traits turned out not be
valid, which I would presume they would conclude given how the paper was set up.
RESPONSE: The reviewer suggests to further elaborate the inferences from the main results of the
manuscript. We revised the conclusions part of the manuscript and elaborated the implications
further.
Also, although I generally agree with the authors’ interpretations, I wonder if more discussion should
be devoted to the potential effect of geographic range size, which the authors suggest might have
produced a similar pattern (lines 408-409; also figure S3).
RESPONSE: As reviewer 1 suggested as well, we took a closer look at the potential influence of
geographic range and added parts in the results (lines 329ff) and discussion (451ff).
It seems here that a more detailed discussion of the traits permitting species to live in lotic versus
lentic habitats might be useful, especially if they are organismic level properties and not aggregate
species-level properties.
RESPONSE: We agree with the reviewer that these additional questions are important. However, we
think that the discussion of the morphological requirements for living in different habitats is a very
broad subject and beyond the scope of this study.

Comments to the Author(s)
I commend the authors for performing many of the suggested analyses, including examining
similarly-sized geographic ranges in both water categories to assess whether their durations still
differ significantly when controlling for range size. The authors thoroughly addressed most of my
concerns with their manuscript, and I just have a few remaining points, detailed below.
1. The authors analyzed the data without singleton taxa and found no significant differences. I
understand the authors performed analyses to test the robustness of the singleton taxa, but I still
think it would be useful for readers to know that the results do not hold if singletons are removed.
The results could be presented in the supplementary materials.
RESPONSE: We agree with the reviewer that this point should be mentioned in the manuscript.
ACTION: The duration analysis without single-interval species was added to the R-script which is part
of the electronic supplement. The results are now mentioned in the manuscript (lines 335f, lines 344ff
and lines 390 and 398ff) and, as suggested, presented in the supplement as an additional table
(Table S14) and figure (Figure S4).
2. In their section on taphonomic biases, the authors note that the condition of specimens was
not available for all taxa, and thus respective samples of occurrences from each environment were
used. However, no mention is made of sample size here; perhaps it should be added for enhanced
clarity (lines 167-169)?
RESPONSE: We thank the reviewer for this comment and added the sample sizes for specimen
completeness analysis to our manuscript in lines 169f.
3. I am still a confused about the assignment of lithologies to habitat. Couldn’t a marl or siltstone
also represent a lentic habitat?
RESPONSE: In accordance with our lithology assignments, we argue that the formation of marl or
siltstone, as mentioned by the reviewer, is untypical for stagnant water environments but
“characteristic for low-velocity flows or standing water with little wave action” [1].
ACTION: For further clarification, we modified the caption of figure 1 by adding a part about the
sedimentary structure (like cross-stratification) to the caption, which was part of the figure only so
far (line 732).
