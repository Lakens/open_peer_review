Replication of previous existing, in particular influential, research, as well as pre-registration of
the expectations and the planned methodology and analyses, are important steps ahead for the
progress of science, including psychology. The research question, not to say area, of the links
between religion and prosociality, has been ongoing for many decades, though with some
changes in methodology and theoretical frameworks that envelop the, otherwise, in my opinion,
classic and still the same, but still important, specific research ideas and hypotheses. The
proliferation of reviews and meta-analyses of this research in the last five years attests of the
importance of this research topic and of the fact that some issues remain unanswered or
debatable. Thus, the authors should be applauded for the manuscript submitted to the Royal
Society Open Science, and for carefully designing and thoughtfully justifying the methodology of
the experiments planned.
Below, I will focus exclusively on some serious concerns I have not on the quality and pertinence
of the studies planned if the goal is only to strictly replicate one particular work (Shariff &
Norenzayan, 2007; therefore, S&N, 2017), but on the limited significance of the future findings
(whatever they will be) if the goal is to provide an important, possibly definitive, answer on the
question of whether religious priming increases prosociality (what seems to be the goal of the
authors if we read, e.g., the abstract).
The general observation that can be made is that by focusing too narrowly to the goal of
replicating one study (S&N, 2007) or kinds of studies (ones that used the Dictator game
paradigm), the authors seem to have missed the broader picture (many other studies, numerous
more theoretical issues) that makes the religious prosociality research question a much more
complex issue that asks for more nuances than the ideas the authors aim to test here in their
planned replication studies. Not that the latter is not legitimate to be done, but the findings of the
planned experiments, whatever may turn out to be, could not be considered as providing an
unambiguous and definitive answer on the religious prosociality question.
1. Too narrow focus on a limited part of previous research
Inserting their theorization into a more general framework of research, theory, and various
methodological alternatives of the religion (religious priming) and prosociality hypothesis will
help the authors to better evaluate what exactly their goal is and possibly reconsider some
decisions they took for the planned studies. For instance, in parallel to S&N, in 2007, another
independent work was published also showing effects of religious priming on prosociality
(Pichon et al., 2007, EJSP; cited 234 times), but using other theoretical bases, religious primes, and
measures of prosocial inclination. Moreover, several review chapters/articles on religion and
prosociality have been published in the last years (by first authors other than S&N, i.e. Batson,
Galen, Preston, Saroglou, Tsang; none of them cited here) that point out issues that seem not to
have been taken into consideration by the authors. As it will appear below, this has direct
implications on some of the decisions the authors made and thus the possible implications of
their future findings.
2. Prosociality towards whom?
2.1. It is highly questionable that using a Dictator game is the best (even, the appropriate) way to
examine the religious prosociality hypothesis. The DG implies giving to anonymous others.
However, as Saroglou et al. (2005, JSSR; cited 279 times) found (see Blogowska & Saroglou, 2011,
JSSR, Study 2, for replication; cited 52 times), religiosity relates to prosocial inclinations toward
ingroup members and people with whom one is in regular interaction but does not extend to
unknown persons. This is also a major conclusion of Galen’s (2012, Psy Bull; cited 158 times)
review.
3
2.2. Moreover, theoretically, it has been argued that religion should imply prosociality more
clearly when the target is a person in need (Saroglou, 2013, APA Hbk review chapter; cited 54
times). In most if not all studies on religious prosociality in Saroglou and coll.’s lab, be they
focused on individual religiosity or religious priming effects, the target is a person in need (see
Saroglou et al., 2005; Pichon et al., 2007; Pichon & Saroglou, 2009; Blogowska & Saroglou, 2011,
2013; Blogowska et al., 2013). In some of them, the target makes an explicit request to be helped;
in others not.
2.3. Consequently, my recommendation will be that either the authors explicitly restrict their
ambition in only testing the replicability of S&N (2007) experiment that is limited to generosity
toward unknown and not in need targets and thus explicitly acknowledge that this cannot fully
or even appropriately address the general religious prosociality hypothesis. Or, alternatively, or
preferably, that the authors change their methodological paradigm for one where religious
prosociality is tested in reference to (ingroup) persons in need.
3. Priming what?
3.1. Previous research in the last 10 years on the effects of religious priming on social behavior in
general, and prosocial one in particular, has often pointed out the importance to distinguish (or at
least to be aware of the distinction) between different kinds of religious priming, e.g. ones
denoting individual vs. social religion; coalitional and institutional religion vs. spirituality and
faith; benevolent vs. malevolent images of God; and ones with positive vs. negative valence. I
presume the authors are aware of these distinctions. Do the decisions the authors took for all
religious words/texts (in the implicit priming, the reading, and the writing an essay conditions)
take into account that previous research? (I do not mean that the authors have to adopt these
distinctions, but to justify their choice; for instance, my opinion is that religious priming in
people’s life is a “package” that includes all the above mentioned aspects; thus, it is legitimate to
examine what the priming of this package has as effects).
3.2. It seems though that there will be high variability between the specific nature of the religious
ideas primes between the three religious conditions (primed words as in S&N; passage of the
Transfiguration; unknown content of the essay). Thus, given this potentially important content
variability, I doubt that firm conclusions can be made on the role of the specific nature of the
priming (implicit vs. explicit). Would not it be better if the authors try to have a design with the
same/similar religious ideas across the religious conditions?
3.3. The choice of the biblical passage of the Transfiguration of Jesus may not be optimal. I
understand, to some extent, the authors’ concern not to have a biblical passage clearly evoking
prosocial values but choosing a passage that clearly describes a paranormal phenomenon would
potentially activate mixed feelings to participants depending on their degree of rationalism, form
or religiosity or irreligiosity, and openness to the paranormal.
3.3.2. BTW: no reference is made in the Introduction on previous studies having used the reading
of biblical vs. control texts to activate/enhance prosociality. A too rapid reader may get the
impression room” that the authors here are the first who imagined such methodological strategy
(see wording in p. 7).
3.4. I wonder whether asking people to “sort items they have in their home, apartment, or
dormitory room” is an optimal strategy for the essay-based control condition—especially since
the authors seem to make a maximal effort for having religious ideas fully exempt of any
prosocial connotation. It is not excluded (it is in fact very likely) that people will have in their
apartment and mention items highly relevant to the self (what may refer to values, life goals, and
4
interests) or even family’s and relatives’ pictures, what of course may activate things like
community belonging, ingroup, etc. Or, on the contrary, medals and awards that may accentuate
self-esteem, pride, and possibly self-centeredness. All these may make important noise if it is to
compare with a religious condition expected to enhance generosity.
4. Religious prosociality: if yes, for which causes?
4.1. The manuscript starts by the following sentence: “Does religion promote prosocial behavior
by restraining selfish implications” (abstract)? This is misleading. First, the paper (and planned
studies do not focus on cases, motivations, and underlying processes. Second, as concluded in
previous reviews of extensive research (Saroglou, 2012, 2013), whereas there is substantial
evidence that religious prosociality exists but that is limited in scope and conditional, there is no
evidence (and if anything there is suggestive evidence for the contrary) that religious prosocaility
is based on altruistic, other-oriented and not selfish, self-oriented, motives.
4.2. As far as the S&N 2007 work is concerned, note that the supernatural controlling agent
hypothesis (“God is watching you”) was in that study only a speculative interpretation; nothing
was tested in that work that could really substantiate this interpretation. I have not followed on
details all the recent experiments to be today sure that there is now substantial proof that this
mechanism explains (or even fully explains) the religion-prosociality link. However, what seems
obvious, is that, form a strictly social psychological of prosocial behavior perspective, even if the
above is an important explanatory process (accompanied by the Big God hypothesis at the
societal evolution level), it constitutes only one among a dozen if not dozens of possible
explanatory processes and mechanisms of religious prosociality (see Batson’s work; see also
Saroglou, 2013; and Preston et al., 2014). Even if in the last few years, the Big God hypothesis is at
the center of hot debates, the authors may reconsider whether, from a strictly psychological
perspective, it is necessary, sufficient, useful, or well-justified to build the importance of their
planned experiments (only) on the Big God hypothesis.
5. Other, less critical, issues
5.1. The authors state in p. 4: “S&N’s experiments have inspired a large body of work on the
behavioural effects of religious priming”. Are they sure of this attribution? May his attribution
suffer from some ethnocentrism or ingroup-limited in scope picture? This sounds if not
inaccurate, at least excessive, when one takes into account first important previous to 2007 work,
including experimental one, on religious prosociality; second the fact that the same year (2007)
two other studies on religious priming and their effects on social (prosocial and moral) behavior
were published in international journals; and third, that two, if not more, studies on religious
priming and its effects (I think one was on perception/attention) were published in the early
2000s again in international journals.
5.2. I fully understand and share Gomes & McCullough’s concern (as cited in p. 5) not to have
too explicit religious words. But the alterative, that is to use words (like “spirit”) that may have a
religious/spiritual or secular meaning (except if I misunderstand something here) seems also
problematic. Why not to adopt here in the planed experiments subliminal priming? (Thus, the
same words, in subliminal vs. supraliminal vs. explicit reading conditions could possibly be a
better test—in reference to my point on 3.2.)
In conclusion, though my comments may appear numerous, and at first glance possibly a bit
severe, I would like to confirm to the authors my belief that their goal is to be applauded and
encouraged and I hope they will find my comments useful.
And am happy to sign this review (Vassilis Saroglou)

Review Implicit and Explicit Influences of Religious Cognition
This registered report proposes a study to establish the effect of religious priming on prosocial
behavior. The authors propose to conduct two studies using two different versions of the dictator
game, to increase the likelihood of selfish behavior as the baseline in these tasks. Three different
religious priming manipulations are proposed, involving an implicit prime (scrambled sentence
task), and two explicit primes (reading a text or writing an essay).
I think this is an important and scientifically relevant research project. The authors rightly point
out that currently the debate over the efficacy of religious priming is still not settled and that pre-
registered replication studies are a solution to this problem. At the same time, I am skeptical
regarding the outcomes of this study. My concern is that (similar to the author’s previous work)
the studies will likely yield a null-result. However, rather than settling the debate once and for
all, this will likely only trigger more debate and criticism regarding the specifics of this study.
Although the authors go to great effort to address potential concerns (i.e., by including both
implicit and explicit priming; by conducting a meta-analysis only over the pre-registered studies),
still this will not refute the highly contaminated literature on this topic.
My first recommendation would be to turn this project into an adversarial collaboration if
possible. If the original authors can be involved in the study design, they should also
acknowledge and accept the outcomes – irrespective of whether a positive or a null-result is
obtained. An adversarial collaboration would greatly enhance the credibility of the project to the
broader scientific community. Eventually, I would also recommend to ask the original authors to
disclose their raw data to the scientific community. This would be important to establish that no
gender-differences underlie the effects observed.
However, I also realize that setting up an adversarial collaboration might be difficult and agree
that this project would still provide an important contribution without the consent of the original
authors. I have a few major concerns that can hopefully be used to improve the research design
and proposal.
First, the Introduction now focuses somewhat narrowly on the topic of religious priming and
prosocial behavior. The relevance of this topic for the scientific study of religion remains
underspecified. For instance, the notion that religion primarily evolved as an adaptation to foster
moral and prosocial behavior does not only hinge on religious priming studies. A wide range of
evidence could be cited and complementary lines of evidence from different fields are available
(e.g., historical, anthropological, sociological etc.). As such, the presence / absence of religious
6
priming effects would not be a fatal blow to the theory. Thus, it would be important to place the
religious priming studies in context, and to discuss theories related to supernatural punishment,
the relation between religion and morality etc. in more depth.
In the Introduction the authors discuss the ‘enhanced religious priming’ condition, in which
words were presented without a religious context. However, from the examples that the authors
provide, it seems that in the ‘enhanced religious priming’ condition, the critical words are used
metaphorically and thereby completely lose their ‘religious’ association (e.g., ‘she had high spirit’
would not activate any religious concept whatsoever). Thus, to me it is not surprising that this
condition did not yield any result.
At the end of the Introduction (in the section ‘Present research’) the authors discuss the present
study and describe the two explicit priming conditions. It would be helpful to the reader if the
authors would also describe which implicit priming condition they intend to use – this
information is now only presented in the methods section.
I was missing specific hypotheses regarding the expected outcomes of the different
manipulations and studies. Do the authors anticipate stronger effects for explicit compared to
implicit religious priming conditions and why? Do the authors hypothesize a stronger effect in
Study 2 compared to Study 1, because there is more room for ‘religious primes’ to exert an
additional effect – to shape selfish behavior?
At the start of the Methods section (‘Participants’) the authors mention a 3 x 2 between subjects
design. Also at this point it would be helpful to already explicitly mention which conditions the
authors planned to include.
The authors describe a pre-test in which they measured the mean dictator money transfer. It was
unclear to me whether this test involved actual money. Also: how did the researchers allocate
money, because in my experience it can be quite hard to make individual payments in MT. Also:
MT workers typically expect to perform a task for a fixed rate, so do they really believe that the
payment will be adjusted based on their decisions? A manipulation check would be important to
investigate whether participants really understand and believe the DG manipulation. This
concern obviously also applies to the main studies that the authors propose.
The authors mention the use of an implicit prime condition. However, it is left unclear whether
this involves the standard religious priming condition or the ‘enhanced religious priming’
condition that was mentioned in the Introduction.
In the ‘reading-based-religious priming’ condition, I was missing a test / manipulation check
question to assess whether participants truly read the story and remembered the information that
was presented in the story.
The ‘essay-based religious priming’ condition is quite lengthy compared to the other
manipulations (15 minutes). My suggestion would be to shorten the duration of the task (e.g., 5
minutes) to make it better comparable to the other conditions.
Insufficient information is provided regarding the framing of the different priming
manipulations. Which information will be presented to the participants regarding the different
priming tasks and how could this eventually affect the effects on the DG? Also, it might be good
to include a probe question at the end of the study to ask participants what they think the relation
is between the two different parts of the study.
In the analysis, the authors propose to include both categorical and continuous measures of
7
religiosity. However, it remains unclear why two different types of measures are necessary to
investigate the potential moderating effect of religiosity.
The authors propose to conduct a meta-analysis on pre-registered replication studies only.
However, it is unclear how many of these studies are available and whether a meta-analysis is
feasible for only a limited amount of studies. Please note that we have two pre-registered studies
with null-results available for inclusion in this analysis!
In Study 2, it is explained that participants in the DG have the option to take an additional $0.50
from the other participant. However, it remains unclear to me (and potentially also to the
participant) what happens if both participants select the option to take $0.50 from each other.
How does this affect the credibility of the manipulation?

This is a thoughtfully and important study proposal, and would make a valuable contribution to
the literature on religious priming. More broadly, it would also be an important contribution to
better understand the reproducibility of psychological findings. Over the last several years, it has
become quite clear to me that efforts like this one are crucial for the health of the behavioral
sciences, and Mike McCullough and his students have been doing valuable work in exploring the
replicability of psychological findings. Below I offer some thoughts and recommendations with
the goal of further improving and refining the study design.
A Bit of Theory:
I found the introductory section quite thorough, and the attention and care put into the details of
this literature is commendable. Since I was asked to review this proposed study, I offer some
thoughts, starting with theory. The theory that we have been developing rests on the hypothesis
that religious procosiality is a cultural evolutionary process, meaning there is cultural and
historical variability in whether the supernatural and the moral are intertwined. So among
foraging societies and other smaller scale groups, for example, religion and prosociality are
largely disconnected (the gods are largely indifferent about moral affairs). In these populations,
the theory would predict a lack of any effect of religious reminders on proosciality. It's the
8
convergence between the supernatural and the moral that played a role in large-scale cooperation
(see Norenzayan et al, BBS, in press for a detailed account; or Norenzayan, 2013, Big Gods,
Chapter 7; Atran & Henrich, 2010). This is important because the effect of religious reminders on
DG offers (or any prosocial behavior, for that matter) depend on people culturally inheriting a
religious tradition that connects religion with prosociality, and the claim is strongest for co-
religionist strangers (see Purzycki et al). Second, a growing body of evidence shows that the main
driver of this effect is belief in supernatural punishment (see Purzycki et al, 2015; Shariff &
Norenzayan, 2011; Yilmaz & Bahçekapili, 2016). Supernatural benevolence either has no effect or
has the opposite effect (that might reflect a kind of moral licensing – one can be selfish or violate
prosocial norms, and ask for forgiveness later from a benevolent God or gods). Recent findings in
this regard led us to refine our theoretical framework since Shariff & Norenzayan (2007), as can
be seen in the publications mentioned above. Third, the question about the reproducibility of
religious priming (and social priming more broadly) is distinct from the question about the
origins of religious prosociality. There are several parts to the theoretical framework, only one of
which is the hypothesis about whether religious priming increase prosocial behavior among
strangers.
Of course, the rationale for the study using these primes is justified if the question of interest is a
better understanding of this particular effect’s replicability and its parameters (that is the Shariff
& Norenzayan, 2007 study). But the finding’s interest value also importantly is about informing
the theory, and theory points to reminders that supernatural forces will punish if people do not
follow group prosocial norms, this belief increases prosociality among believers (but non-
believers), and reminders of a loving, forgiving god might drive the effect in the other direction.
These considerations are important in interpreting the relevance of an effect or a lack thereof for
confirming or disconfirming theory-deriven hypotheses.
Power:
It’s advisable to aim for more than .8 power and on the lower-bound estimate of the meta-
analytic effect after correcting for publication bias (not the unbiased effect size). So we need
sufficient statistical power to detect an effect of g=.18. Moreover, this meta-analytic effect size is
for the between-groups difference (control/prime). Correct me if I am wrong, but comparing two
groups of 125 per cell, would have 0.29 power to detect an effect of d= 0.18. The proposed 2- and
3-way interactions require even more power to be detectable. Far more statistical power is needed
to reach conclusions about the reliability of this effect with confidence.
Primes:
The reading prompts are, in my opinion, problematic. I’ve always worried about “text reading”
manipulations in the literature because it’s left to the intuitions of us the researchers as to what’s
a relevant text to prime. In this case, Jesus most likely falls under the category of a
loving/benevolent God. Then the control condition is a fable – yes, the moral of the story is not
about prosociality, but a fable literally means a story with a moral lesson. If this reading
manipulation will be used, I recommend a different, neutral reading for the control condition,
and for the experimental condition, a text that is about supernatural punishment (unless the
authors have different ideas about what in religion, if anything, encourages prosocial behavior).
For example, Yilmaz & Bahçekapili (2016, EHB) found that an explicit prime -- reading about a
punishing God increased prosocial intentions compared to benevolent God or neutral text in a
sample of Muslim Turks. I recommend something similar here that’s appropriate for a majority-
Christian sample of believers on MTurk. Another option is to simply drop the reading prompt
and just stick with the essay writing condition as the explicit prime. (However in this case I
would want to know the content of what people wrote, as once again, supernatural punishment
is the key variable here).
9
Procedure:
I wonder if 15 minutes to write essays is overly optimistic. MTurkers can easily get distracted and
given the online environment, could do other things. We typically manage to get people online to
spend no more than 5 minutes writing essays.
Task
In Experiment 2, each player is allotted 50 cents, but the dictator receives an additional 50 cents
on top of that. So, the ‘equitable’ thing to do is still to split that ‘extra 50 cents’ allotment in half,
so that each player walks away with 75 cents. If I am understanding this right, giving people the
option to take money is just a way of driving down the total giving and thus creating more
potential selfishness, which creates appropriate conditions for the religious prime to have an
effect. This is a clever technique, as long as people actually are willing to take (some researchers
have argued that players have such an aversion to taking in these situations that they will forego
a portion of their own allotments not to take from player B e.g., Korenok et al., 2014). The
prediction here would be that if there was significant taking by religious participants in an
unprimed condition, then this should be reduced in the religious prime condition.
Another challenge will be to make sure that all the participants understand what’s happening,
and trust that the instructions are real (i.e. that they get the totals that each player will have given
the various giving options that the dictator has). I suggest including clear instructions of the
options in that study to make this clear. Something like:
If you TAKE $0.50, then you receive $1.50 in bonus money and the other participant will receive
$0.00.
If you TAKE $0.40, then you receive $1.40 in bonus money and the other participant will receive
$0.10.
Etc.
So there are three concerns: (a) whether players will believe what’s happening, (b) potential
confusion about the rules of the game (c) if there is aversion to take from player B, than there
might not be enough baseline selfishness. It’s good to assess believability and comprehension to
address two of these issues.
Payment plan:
I didn’t quite understand how the payment plan works . Participants get a base payment, plus a
bonus, plus an opportunity to win more money in the DG task?

Comments to the Author:
Three expert reviewers have now assessed the manuscript, including one author of the original
study that forms the basis of the current proposal (Ara Norenzayan). All reviewers find merit in
the proposed study and recommend revision. However, all raise significant issues that require
careful consideration.
Reviewer 1 (Vassilis) offers a broad critical perspective, questioning the utility of the overall
approach as well as critiquing a number of specific methodological details (including the use of
the dictator game). Reviewer 2 (van Elk) is overall positive but questions the breadth of the
Introduction and also notes the lack of clarity in the specific hypotheses underlying each
experiment (these should be specified clearly in every case). The reviewer also queries whether
sufficient manipulation checks (outcome-neutral conditions) are in place. Reviewer 3
(Norenzayan) makes an important point about statistical power, and the authors should ensure
11
that in each experiment the scientific hypotheses map clearly on to the structure of the statistical
tests; thus, the power analysis should (if I understand correctly) correspond to highest level
interaction within the 3 x 2 design structure, as well as any subsequent simple main effects for
specific sub-hypotheses. The study should also be powered to detect the lowest expected effect
size (as the reviewer notes, the estimate corrected for publication bias seems appropriate). A
power of at least 0.9 should be achieved for all hypothesis test, and/or the authors may also wish
to consider a complementary Bayesian approach to ensure interpretability of negative results and
an efficient sampling strategy (e.g.
http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00781/full).
Finally, please ensure that the inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants (and where
applicable, data within participants) are comprehensively detailed as these can generally not be
altered after in principle acceptance.

Comments to the Author(s)
Replication of previous existing, in particular influential, research, as well as pre-registration of
the expectations and the planned methodology and analyses, are important steps ahead for the
progress of science, including psychology. The research question, not to say area, of the links
between religion and prosociality, has been ongoing for many decades, though with some
changes in methodology and theoretical frameworks that envelop the, otherwise, in my opinion,
classic and still the same, but still important, specific research ideas and hypotheses. The
proliferation of reviews and meta-analyses of this research in the last five years attests of the
importance of this research topic and of the fact that some issues remain unanswered or
debatable. Thus, the authors should be applauded for the manuscript submitted to the Royal
Society Open Science, and for carefully designing and thoughtfully justifying the methodology of
the experiments planned.
Below, I will focus exclusively on some serious concerns I have not on the quality and pertinence
of the studies planned if the goal is only to strictly replicate one particular work (Shariff &
Norenzayan, 2007; therefore, S&N, 2017), but on the limited significance of the future findings
(whatever they will be) if the goal is to provide an important, possibly definitive, answer on the
question of whether religious priming increases prosociality (what seems to be the goal of the
authors if we read, e.g., the abstract).
The general observation that can be made is that by focusing too narrowly to the goal of
replicating one study (S&N, 2007) or kinds of studies (ones that used the Dictator game
paradigm), the authors seem to have missed the broader picture (many other studies, numerous
more theoretical issues) that makes the religious prosociality research question a much more
complex issue that asks for more nuances than the ideas the authors aim to test here in their
planned replication studies. Not that the latter is not legitimate to be done, but the findings of the
planned experiments, whatever may turn out to be, could not be considered as providing an
unambiguous and definitive answer on the religious prosociality question.
1. Too narrow focus on a limited part of previous research
Inserting their theorization into a more general framework of research, theory, and various
methodological alternatives of the religion (religious priming) and prosociality hypothesis will
help the authors to better evaluate what exactly their goal is and possibly reconsider some
decisions they took for the planned studies. For instance, in parallel to S&N, in 2007, another
12
independent work was published also showing effects of religious priming on prosociality
(Pichon et al., 2007, EJSP; cited 234 times), but using other theoretical bases, religious primes, and
measures of prosocial inclination. Moreover, several review chapters/articles on religion and
prosociality have been published in the last years (by first authors other than S&N, i.e. Batson,
Galen, Preston, Saroglou, Tsang; none of them cited here) that point out issues that seem not to
have been taken into consideration by the authors. As it will appear below, this has direct
implications on some of the decisions the authors made and thus the possible implications of
their future findings.
2. Prosociality towards whom?
2.1. It is highly questionable that using a Dictator game is the best (even, the appropriate) way to
examine the religious prosociality hypothesis. The DG implies giving to anonymous others.
However, as Saroglou et al. (2005, JSSR; cited 279 times) found (see Blogowska & Saroglou, 2011,
JSSR, Study 2, for replication; cited 52 times), religiosity relates to prosocial inclinations toward
ingroup members and people with whom one is in regular interaction but does not extend to
unknown persons. This is also a major conclusion of Galen’s (2012, Psy Bull; cited 158 times)
review.
2.2. Moreover, theoretically, it has been argued that religion should imply prosociality more
clearly when the target is a person in need (Saroglou, 2013, APA Hbk review chapter; cited 54
times). In most if not all studies on religious prosociality in Saroglou and coll.’s lab, be they
focused on individual religiosity or religious priming effects, the target is a person in need (see
Saroglou et al., 2005; Pichon et al., 2007; Pichon & Saroglou, 2009; Blogowska & Saroglou, 2011,
2013; Blogowska et al., 2013). In some of them, the target makes an explicit request to be helped;
in others not.
2.3. Consequently, my recommendation will be that either the authors explicitly restrict their
ambition in only testing the replicability of S&N (2007) experiment that is limited to generosity
toward unknown and not in need targets and thus explicitly acknowledge that this cannot fully
or even appropriately address the general religious prosociality hypothesis. Or, alternatively, or
preferably, that the authors change their methodological paradigm for one where religious
prosociality is tested in reference to (ingroup) persons in need.
3. Priming what?
3.1. Previous research in the last 10 years on the effects of religious priming on social behavior in
general, and prosocial one in particular, has often pointed out the importance to distinguish (or at
least to be aware of the distinction) between different kinds of religious priming, e.g. ones
denoting individual vs. social religion; coalitional and institutional religion vs. spirituality and
faith; benevolent vs. malevolent images of God; and ones with positive vs. negative valence. I
presume the authors are aware of these distinctions. Do the decisions the authors took for all
religious words/texts (in the implicit priming, the reading, and the writing an essay conditions)
take into account that previous research? (I do not mean that the authors have to adopt these
distinctions, but to justify their choice; for instance, my opinion is that religious priming in
people’s life is a “package” that includes all the above mentioned aspects; thus, it is legitimate to
examine what the priming of this package has as effects).
3.2. It seems though that there will be high variability between the specific nature of the religious
ideas primes between the three religious conditions (primed words as in S&N; passage of the
Transfiguration; unknown content of the essay). Thus, given this potentially important content
variability, I doubt that firm conclusions can be made on the role of the specific nature of the
13
priming (implicit vs. explicit). Would not it be better if the authors try to have a design with the
same/similar religious ideas across the religious conditions?
3.3. The choice of the biblical passage of the Transfiguration of Jesus may not be optimal. I
understand, to some extent, the authors’ concern not to have a biblical passage clearly evoking
prosocial values but choosing a passage that clearly describes a paranormal phenomenon would
potentially activate mixed feelings to participants depending on their degree of rationalism, form
or religiosity or irreligiosity, and openness to the paranormal.
3.3.2. BTW: no reference is made in the Introduction on previous studies having used the reading
of biblical vs. control texts to activate/enhance prosociality. A too rapid reader may get the
impression room” that the authors here are the first who imagined such methodological strategy
(see wording in p. 7).
3.4. I wonder whether asking people to “sort items they have in their home, apartment, or
dormitory room” is an optimal strategy for the essay-based control condition—especially since
the authors seem to make a maximal effort for having religious ideas fully exempt of any
prosocial connotation. It is not excluded (it is in fact very likely) that people will have in their
apartment and mention items highly relevant to the self (what may refer to values, life goals, and
interests) or even family’s and relatives’ pictures, what of course may activate things like
community belonging, ingroup, etc. Or, on the contrary, medals and awards that may accentuate
self-esteem, pride, and possibly self-centeredness. All these may make important noise if it is to
compare with a religious condition expected to enhance generosity.
4. Religious prosociality: if yes, for which causes?
4.1. The manuscript starts by the following sentence: “Does religion promote prosocial behavior
by restraining selfish implications” (abstract)? This is misleading. First, the paper (and planned
studies do not focus on cases, motivations, and underlying processes. Second, as concluded in
previous reviews of extensive research (Saroglou, 2012, 2013), whereas there is substantial
evidence that religious prosociality exists but that is limited in scope and conditional, there is no
evidence (and if anything there is suggestive evidence for the contrary) that religious prosocaility
is based on altruistic, other-oriented and not selfish, self-oriented, motives.
4.2. As far as the S&N 2007 work is concerned, note that the supernatural controlling agent
hypothesis (“God is watching you”) was in that study only a speculative interpretation; nothing
was tested in that work that could really substantiate this interpretation. I have not followed on
details all the recent experiments to be today sure that there is now substantial proof that this
mechanism explains (or even fully explains) the religion-prosociality link. However, what seems
obvious, is that, form a strictly social psychological of prosocial behavior perspective, even if the
above is an important explanatory process (accompanied by the Big God hypothesis at the
societal evolution level), it constitutes only one among a dozen if not dozens of possible
explanatory processes and mechanisms of religious prosociality (see Batson’s work; see also
Saroglou, 2013; and Preston et al., 2014). Even if in the last few years, the Big God hypothesis is at
the center of hot debates, the authors may reconsider whether, from a strictly psychological
perspective, it is necessary, sufficient, useful, or well-justified to build the importance of their
planned experiments (only) on the Big God hypothesis.
5. Other, less critical, issues
5.1. The authors state in p. 4: “S&N’s experiments have inspired a large body of work on the
behavioural effects of religious priming”. Are they sure of this attribution? May his attribution
suffer from some ethnocentrism or ingroup-limited in scope picture? This sounds if not
14
inaccurate, at least excessive, when one takes into account first important previous to 2007 work,
including experimental one, on religious prosociality; second the fact that the same year (2007)
two other studies on religious priming and their effects on social (prosocial and moral) behavior
were published in international journals; and third, that two, if not more, studies on religious
priming and its effects (I think one was on perception/attention) were published in the early
2000s again in international journals.
5.2. I fully understand and share Gomes & McCullough’s concern (as cited in p. 5) not to have
too explicit religious words. But the alterative, that is to use words (like “spirit”) that may have a
religious/spiritual or secular meaning (except if I misunderstand something here) seems also
problematic. Why not to adopt here in the planed experiments subliminal priming? (Thus, the
same words, in subliminal vs. supraliminal vs. explicit reading conditions could possibly be a
better test—in reference to my point on 3.2.)
In conclusion, though my comments may appear numerous, and at first glance possibly a bit
severe, I would like to confirm to the authors my belief that their goal is to be applauded and
encouraged and I hope they will find my comments useful.
And am happy to sign this review (Vassilis Saroglou)

Comments to the Author(s)
Review Implicit and Explicit Influences of Religious Cognition
This registered report proposes a study to establish the effect of religious priming on prosocial
behavior. The authors propose to conduct two studies using two different versions of the dictator
game, to increase the likelihood of selfish behavior as the baseline in these tasks. Three different
religious priming manipulations are proposed, involving an implicit prime (scrambled sentence
task), and two explicit primes (reading a text or writing an essay).
I think this is an important and scientifically relevant research project. The authors rightly point
out that currently the debate over the efficacy of religious priming is still not settled and that pre-
registered replication studies are a solution to this problem. At the same time, I am skeptical
regarding the outcomes of this study. My concern is that (similar to the author’s previous work)
the studies will likely yield a null-result. However, rather than settling the debate once and for
all, this will likely only trigger more debate and criticism regarding the specifics of this study.
Although the authors go to great effort to address potential concerns (i.e., by including both
implicit and explicit priming; by conducting a meta-analysis only over the pre-registered studies),
still this will not refute the highly contaminated literature on this topic.
My first recommendation would be to turn this project into an adversarial collaboration if
possible. If the original authors can be involved in the study design, they should also
acknowledge and accept the outcomes – irrespective of whether a positive or a null-result is
obtained. An adversarial collaboration would greatly enhance the credibility of the project to the
broader scientific community. Eventually, I would also recommend to ask the original authors to
disclose their raw data to the scientific community. This would be important to establish that no
gender-differences underlie the effects observed.
However, I also realize that setting up an adversarial collaboration might be difficult and agree
that this project would still provide an important contribution without the consent of the original
15
authors. I have a few major concerns that can hopefully be used to improve the research design
and proposal.
First, the Introduction now focuses somewhat narrowly on the topic of religious priming and
prosocial behavior. The relevance of this topic for the scientific study of religion remains
underspecified. For instance, the notion that religion primarily evolved as an adaptation to foster
moral and prosocial behavior does not only hinge on religious priming studies. A wide range of
evidence could be cited and complementary lines of evidence from different fields are available
(e.g., historical, anthropological, sociological etc.). As such, the presence / absence of religious
priming effects would not be a fatal blow to the theory. Thus, it would be important to place the
religious priming studies in context, and to discuss theories related to supernatural punishment,
the relation between religion and morality etc. in more depth.
In the Introduction the authors discuss the ‘enhanced religious priming’ condition, in which
words were presented without a religious context. However, from the examples that the authors
provide, it seems that in the ‘enhanced religious priming’ condition, the critical words are used
metaphorically and thereby completely lose their ‘religious’ association (e.g., ‘she had high spirit’
would not activate any religious concept whatsoever). Thus, to me it is not surprising that this
condition did not yield any result.
At the end of the Introduction (in the section ‘Present research’) the authors discuss the present
study and describe the two explicit priming conditions. It would be helpful to the reader if the
authors would also describe which implicit priming condition they intend to use – this
information is now only presented in the methods section.
I was missing specific hypotheses regarding the expected outcomes of the different
manipulations and studies. Do the authors anticipate stronger effects for explicit compared to
implicit religious priming conditions and why? Do the authors hypothesize a stronger effect in
Study 2 compared to Study 1, because there is more room for ‘religious primes’ to exert an
additional effect – to shape selfish behavior?
At the start of the Methods section (‘Participants’) the authors mention a 3 x 2 between subjects
design. Also at this point it would be helpful to already explicitly mention which conditions the
authors planned to include.
The authors describe a pre-test in which they measured the mean dictator money transfer. It was
unclear to me whether this test involved actual money. Also: how did the researchers allocate
money, because in my experience it can be quite hard to make individual payments in MT. Also:
MT workers typically expect to perform a task for a fixed rate, so do they really believe that the
payment will be adjusted based on their decisions? A manipulation check would be important to
investigate whether participants really understand and believe the DG manipulation. This
concern obviously also applies to the main studies that the authors propose.
The authors mention the use of an implicit prime condition. However, it is left unclear whether
this involves the standard religious priming condition or the ‘enhanced religious priming’
condition that was mentioned in the Introduction.
In the ‘reading-based-religious priming’ condition, I was missing a test / manipulation check
question to assess whether participants truly read the story and remembered the information that
was presented in the story.
The ‘essay-based religious priming’ condition is quite lengthy compared to the other
16
manipulations (15 minutes). My suggestion would be to shorten the duration of the task (e.g., 5
minutes) to make it better comparable to the other conditions.
Insufficient information is provided regarding the framing of the different priming
manipulations. Which information will be presented to the participants regarding the different
priming tasks and how could this eventually affect the effects on the DG? Also, it might be good
to include a probe question at the end of the study to ask participants what they think the relation
is between the two different parts of the study.
In the analysis, the authors propose to include both categorical and continuous measures of
religiosity. However, it remains unclear why two different types of measures are necessary to
investigate the potential moderating effect of religiosity.
The authors propose to conduct a meta-analysis on pre-registered replication studies only.
However, it is unclear how many of these studies are available and whether a meta-analysis is
feasible for only a limited amount of studies. Please note that we have two pre-registered studies
with null-results available for inclusion in this analysis!
In Study 2, it is explained that participants in the DG have the option to take an additional $0.50
from the other participant. However, it remains unclear to me (and potentially also to the
participant) what happens if both participants select the option to take $0.50 from each other.
How does this affect the credibility of the manipulation?

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a thoughtfully and important study proposal, and would make a valuable contribution to
the literature on religious priming. More broadly, it would also be an important contribution to
better understand the reproducibility of psychological findings. Over the last several years, it has
become quite clear to me that efforts like this one are crucial for the health of the behavioral
sciences, and Mike McCullough and his students have been doing valuable work in exploring the
replicability of psychological findings. Below I offer some thoughts and recommendations with
the goal of further improving and refining the study design.
A Bit of Theory:
I found the introductory section quite thorough, and the attention and care put into the details of
this literature is commendable. Since I was asked to review this proposed study, I offer some
thoughts, starting with theory. The theory that we have been developing rests on the hypothesis
that religious procosiality is a cultural evolutionary process, meaning there is cultural and
historical variability in whether the supernatural and the moral are intertwined. So among
foraging societies and other smaller scale groups, for example, religion and prosociality are
largely disconnected (the gods are largely indifferent about moral affairs). In these populations,
the theory would predict a lack of any effect of religious reminders on proosciality. It's the
convergence between the supernatural and the moral that played a role in large-scale cooperation
(see Norenzayan et al, BBS, in press for a detailed account; or Norenzayan, 2013, Big Gods,
Chapter 7; Atran & Henrich, 2010). This is important because the effect of religious reminders on
DG offers (or any prosocial behavior, for that matter) depend on people culturally inheriting a
17
religious tradition that connects religion with prosociality, and the claim is strongest for co-
religionist strangers (see Purzycki et al). Second, a growing body of evidence shows that the main
driver of this effect is belief in supernatural punishment (see Purzycki et al, 2015; Shariff &
Norenzayan, 2011; Yilmaz & Bahçekapili, 2016). Supernatural benevolence either has no effect or
has the opposite effect (that might reflect a kind of moral licensing – one can be selfish or violate
prosocial norms, and ask for forgiveness later from a benevolent God or gods). Recent findings in
this regard led us to refine our theoretical framework since Shariff & Norenzayan (2007), as can
be seen in the publications mentioned above. Third, the question about the reproducibility of
religious priming (and social priming more broadly) is distinct from the question about the
origins of religious prosociality. There are several parts to the theoretical framework, only one of
which is the hypothesis about whether religious priming increase prosocial behavior among
strangers.
Of course, the rationale for the study using these primes is justified if the question of interest is a
better understanding of this particular effect’s replicability and its parameters (that is the Shariff
& Norenzayan, 2007 study). But the finding’s interest value also importantly is about informing
the theory, and theory points to reminders that supernatural forces will punish if people do not
follow group prosocial norms, this belief increases prosociality among believers (but non-
believers), and reminders of a loving, forgiving god might drive the effect in the other direction.
These considerations are important in interpreting the relevance of an effect or a lack thereof for
confirming or disconfirming theory-deriven hypotheses.
Power:
It’s advisable to aim for more than .8 power and on the lower-bound estimate of the meta-
analytic effect after correcting for publication bias (not the unbiased effect size). So we need
sufficient statistical power to detect an effect of g=.18. Moreover, this meta-analytic effect size is
for the between-groups difference (control/prime). Correct me if I am wrong, but comparing two
groups of 125 per cell, would have 0.29 power to detect an effect of d= 0.18. The proposed 2- and
3-way interactions require even more power to be detectable. Far more statistical power is needed
to reach conclusions about the reliability of this effect with confidence.
Primes:
The reading prompts are, in my opinion, problematic. I’ve always worried about “text reading”
manipulations in the literature because it’s left to the intuitions of us the researchers as to what’s
a relevant text to prime. In this case, Jesus most likely falls under the category of a
loving/benevolent God. Then the control condition is a fable – yes, the moral of the story is not
about prosociality, but a fable literally means a story with a moral lesson. If this reading
manipulation will be used, I recommend a different, neutral reading for the control condition,
and for the experimental condition, a text that is about supernatural punishment (unless the
authors have different ideas about what in religion, if anything, encourages prosocial behavior).
For example, Yilmaz & Bahçekapili (2016, EHB) found that an explicit prime -- reading about a
punishing God increased prosocial intentions compared to benevolent God or neutral text in a
sample of Muslim Turks. I recommend something similar here that’s appropriate for a majority-
Christian sample of believers on MTurk. Another option is to simply drop the reading prompt
and just stick with the essay writing condition as the explicit prime. (However in this case I
would want to know the content of what people wrote, as once again, supernatural punishment
is the key variable here).
Procedure:
I wonder if 15 minutes to write essays is overly optimistic. MTurkers can easily get distracted and
given the online environment, could do other things. We typically manage to get people online to
spend no more than 5 minutes writing essays.

Task
In Experiment 2, each player is allotted 50 cents, but the dictator receives an additional 50 cents
on top of that. So, the ‘equitable’ thing to do is still to split that ‘extra 50 cents’ allotment in half,
so that each player walks away with 75 cents. If I am understanding this right, giving people the
option to take money is just a way of driving down the total giving and thus creating more
potential selfishness, which creates appropriate conditions for the religious prime to have an
effect. This is a clever technique, as long as people actually are willing to take (some researchers
have argued that players have such an aversion to taking in these situations that they will forego
a portion of their own allotments not to take from player B e.g., Korenok et al., 2014). The
prediction here would be that if there was significant taking by religious participants in an
unprimed condition, then this should be reduced in the religious prime condition.
Another challenge will be to make sure that all the participants understand what’s happening,
and trust that the instructions are real (i.e. that they get the totals that each player will have given
the various giving options that the dictator has). I suggest including clear instructions of the
options in that study to make this clear. Something like:
If you TAKE $0.50, then you receive $1.50 in bonus money and the other participant will receive
$0.00.
If you TAKE $0.40, then you receive $1.40 in bonus money and the other participant will receive
$0.10.
Etc.
So there are three concerns: (a) whether players will believe what’s happening, (b) potential
confusion about the rules of the game (c) if there is aversion to take from player B, than there
might not be enough baseline selfishness. It’s good to assess believability and comprehension to
address two of these issues.
Payment plan:
I didn’t quite understand how the payment plan works . Participants get a base payment, plus a
bonus, plus an opportunity to win more money in the DG task?

The authors made substantial efforts to take all reviewers' comments into account in the revision.
I acknowledge that the reviews were not short, but the responses are perhaps too lengthy, what
puts the reviewer (at least me) into a dilemma: how many hours can one dedicate to review a 60
pp text, with > 12 pages of responses, and to write a detailed review? I have to confess that I read
carefully the reviews and responses (22 pages) and the introduction (14 pages), but not the
method and results sections since most of the changes were reported in the responses section; my
methodological comments were successfully taken into account; and I was unqualified to follow
on details the debate on power.
Overall, my feeling is that the authors did a good job. I would have preferred more
straightforwardness in their responses: do they intellectually endorse or not the model of the
cultural evolution hypothesis on religious prosociality? do they agree or not that from their
results we will not have a proof of the theory (a feeling shared by both R1 and R2)? instead, they
adopted the position/kind of authority argument "we share the concerns, things are more
complex, but we decided to focus on one piece, selected not necessarily because it is the most
critical but because it is what is much discussed today" (I am a bit caricaturing here, but I hope
my point here is receivable).
Nevertheless, as far as my lengthy comments on the previous version are concerned, I am glad
that they led the authors to importantly reframe their objectives (and subsequently their future
findings), including very clearly in the title. (Note also that after I expressed my concerns in the
previous round, I was positively surprised to see that the senior author of the manuscript was
chairing a symposium at SPSP aiming to criticize-if I understood well from the abstract--the idea
that the dictator game measures the very nature of prosociality).
So, I recommend acceptance, though I am sure we can discuss for ages on specific parts of the
argumentation.
I wish the authors good success, though I still find the situation a bit surrealistic: they preregister
and will carry out studies to test an hypothesis (religious priming increases sharing of gains with
anonymous others) whose confirmation or infirmation does not constitute a necessary and
sufficient proof for a theory they do not explicitly say they endorse but have to acknowledge it is
highly discussed today.

The authors have adequately addressed my previous concerns. The inclusion of the different
hypotheses and a more rigorous analysis plan are valuable contributions to this pre-registered
report. Upon re-reading the manuscript, I had two remaining questions.
First, the authors propose to use a between-subjects design including the factor Religiosity
(Religious vs. Non-religious), which refers to the participant’s religiosity. Maybe I missed this,
but I couldn’t find any information on how it will be guaranteed that approximately half of all
participants are religious and the other half non-religious. Will there be an inclusion / exclusion
rule during data-collection to obtain sufficient religious participants? Relatedly, given that
religiosity is a continuous measure, wouldn’t it be possible instead of making different groups
(religious vs. non-religious) to analyze this as a continuous variable / moderator?
Second, regarding the proposed Bayesian analysis, I consulted a colleague who is an expert on
this method and he made some final suggestions to be more careful with interpreting the BFs:
‘In my opinion, Dienes's procedure is described and applied accurately (i.e., the specification of
the prior distribution for the effect size using a uniform, normal, and half-normal distribution)
and the proposed analyses appear to be sound to me. My only remark is about the guidelines for
interpreting the Bayes factor. The authors write:
"We will use the conventional criteria provided by Dienes to interpret the
computed Bayes factor, with a Bayes factor equal to or greater than three indicating significant
evidence in favor of the research hypothesis (that religious priming increases DG transfers), a
Bayes factor of 1/3 or less indicating significant evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (that
religious priming does not increase DG transfers), and a Bayes factor between 1/3 and 3
indicating insensitive data, on the understanding that the Bayes factor provides a continuous
measure, rather than a strict cutoff point [41]." (pp. 21-22).
First, I want to emphasize that the authors acknowledge that the Bayes factor quantifies evidence
on a continuous scale and that the evidence labels are guidelines and not strict cutoff points.
However, I am not sure whether it is ideal to describe a Bayes factor of three as "significant"
evidence. In my opinion, it would maybe be wise to avoid the term "significant" due to its strong
association with the classical null hypothesis significance testing framework, but this might be a
personal preference. Furthermore, a Bayes factor of BF10 = 3 indicates that the data are three
times more likely under H1 than under H0 which is some evidence for an effect, however, some
people might say that this is still not completely convincing.
For instance, E.J. conducted a preregistered replication ("Turning the hands of time again: a
purely confirmatory replication study and a Bayesian analysis") where he monitored the Bayes
21
factor as more participants were tested and he set the stopping criterion to a Bayes factor larger
than ten and not three. Nevertheless, the authors correctly cite Dienes who termed Bayes factors
less than 1/3 or greater than 3 as representing "substantial evidence". So again, this might be a
personal preference.
To sum up, I think that the proposed Bayesian analyses are sound. Furthermore, since the authors
acknowledge that the Bayes factor quantifies evidence on a continuous scale and that the
evidence labels are guidelines and not strict cutoff points, I am not too worried that they will
overinterpret a Bayes factor of three as conclusive evidence.’

original expert reviewers have now provided re-reviews, but one reviewer declined to review,
which delayed the review process while we sought for a replacement reviewer. However, given
the uniform appraisal of the two remaining reviewers, in the interests of minimizing further
delays I have decided to render a decision without recruiting an additional reviewer.
Both remaining reviewers have responded positively to the revision and the manuscript should
be ready to proceed to in principle acceptance (IPA) following a final round of minor
clarifications, which will not require further in-depth review and so should be completed within
days of resubmission. Reviewer 1 (Michiel van Elk) asks for clarification of the inclusion criteria
and analysis approach, and a co-reviewer (Quentin Gronau) consulted for statistical advaice
makes a good point about the terminological use of "significant" in the interpretation of Bayes
factors. Gronau also makes the point that a Bayes factor threshold of 3 provides the minimal
standard of interpretable evidence. I would recommend that the authors consider adopting a
slightly higher threshold, but this is a suggestion only, and a threshold of 3 is sufficient for IPA.
The second reviewer, Vassilis Saroglou, recommends IPA with no further changes.

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have adequately addressed my previous concerns. The inclusion of the different
hypotheses and a more rigorous analysis plan are valuable contributions to this pre-registered
report. Upon re-reading the manuscript, I had two remaining questions.
First, the authors propose to use a between-subjects design including the factor Religiosity
(Religious vs. Non-religious), which refers to the participant’s religiosity. Maybe I missed this,
but I couldn’t find any information on how it will be guaranteed that approximately half of all
participants are religious and the other half non-religious. Will there be an inclusion / exclusion
rule during data-collection to obtain sufficient religious participants? Relatedly, given that
religiosity is a continuous measure, wouldn’t it be possible instead of making different groups
(religious vs. non-religious) to analyze this as a continuous variable / moderator?
23
Second, regarding the proposed Bayesian analysis, I consulted a colleague who is an expert on
this method and he made some final suggestions to be more careful with interpreting the BFs:
‘In my opinion, Dienes's procedure is described and applied accurately (i.e., the specification of
the prior distribution for the effect size using a uniform, normal, and half-normal distribution)
and the proposed analyses appear to be sound to me. My only remark is about the guidelines for
interpreting the Bayes factor. The authors write:
"We will use the conventional criteria provided by Dienes to interpret the
computed Bayes factor, with a Bayes factor equal to or greater than three indicating significant
evidence in favor of the research hypothesis (that religious priming increases DG transfers), a
Bayes factor of 1/3 or less indicating significant evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (that
religious priming does not increase DG transfers), and a Bayes factor between 1/3 and 3
indicating insensitive data, on the understanding that the Bayes factor provides a continuous
measure, rather than a strict cutoff point [41]." (pp. 21-22).
First, I want to emphasize that the authors acknowledge that the Bayes factor quantifies evidence
on a continuous scale and that the evidence labels are guidelines and not strict cutoff points.
However, I am not sure whether it is ideal to describe a Bayes factor of three as "significant"
evidence. In my opinion, it would maybe be wise to avoid the term "significant" due to its strong
association with the classical null hypothesis significance testing framework, but this might be a
personal preference. Furthermore, a Bayes factor of BF10 = 3 indicates that the data are three
times more likely under H1 than under H0 which is some evidence for an effect, however, some
people might say that this is still not completely convincing.
For instance, E.J. conducted a preregistered replication ("Turning the hands of time again: a
purely confirmatory replication study and a Bayesian analysis") where he monitored the Bayes
factor as more participants were tested and he set the stopping criterion to a Bayes factor larger
than ten and not three. Nevertheless, the authors correctly cite Dienes who termed Bayes factors
less than 1/3 or greater than 3 as representing "substantial evidence". So again, this might be a
personal preference.
To sum up, I think that the proposed Bayesian analyses are sound. Furthermore, since the authors
acknowledge that the Bayes factor quantifies evidence on a continuous scale and that the
evidence labels are guidelines and not strict cutoff points, I am not too worried that they will
overinterpret a Bayes factor of three as conclusive evidence.’

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors made substantial efforts to take all reviewers' comments into account in the revision.
I acknowledge that the reviews were not short, but the responses are perhaps too lengthy, what
puts the reviewer (at least me) into a dilemma: how many hours can one dedicate to review a 60
pp text, with > 12 pages of responses, and to write a detailed review? I have to confess that I read
carefully the reviews and responses (22 pages) and the introduction (14 pages), but not the
method and results sections since most of the changes were reported in the responses section; my
methodological comments were successfully taken into account; and I was unqualified to follow
on details the debate on power.
24
Overall, my feeling is that the authors did a good job. I would have preferred more
straightforwardness in their responses: do they intellectually endorse or not the model of the
cultural evolution hypothesis on religious prosociality? do they agree or not that from their
results we will not have a proof of the theory (a feeling shared by both R1 and R2)? instead, they
adopted the position/kind of authority argument "we share the concerns, things are more
complex, but we decided to focus on one piece, selected not necessarily because it is the most
critical but because it is what is much discussed today" (I am a bit caricaturing here, but I hope
my point here is receivable).
Nevertheless, as far as my lengthy comments on the previous version are concerned, I am glad
that they led the authors to importantly reframe their objectives (and subsequently their future
findings), including very clearly in the title. (Note also that after I expressed my concerns in the
previous round, I was positively surprised to see that the senior author of the manuscript was
chairing a symposium at SPSP aiming to criticize-if I understood well from the abstract--the idea
that the dictator game measures the very nature of prosociality).
So, I recommend acceptance, though I am sure we can discuss for ages on specific parts of the
argumentation.
I wish the authors good success, though I still find the situation a bit surrealistic: they preregister
and will carry out studies to test an hypothesis (religious priming increases sharing of gains with
anonymous others) whose confirmation or infirmation does not constitute a necessary and
sufficient proof for a theory they do not explicitly say they endorse but have to acknowledge it is
highly discussed today.
Vassilis Saroglou
Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-170075.R0)
Thanks to the reviewers for their comments. We recognize that our responses to the first round of
comments were quite lengthy, and we appreciate the time and effort invested by everyone in
moving this project forward. Our responses to new suggestions and comments are below.
We agree with Gronau and van Elk that use of the term “significant” in the context of Bayes
factors is potentially misleading. We have therefore revised the relevant passages, so that they
now refer to “substantial” rather than “significant” evidence. We also acknowledge that there are
differences of opinion regarding what should constitute a minimum threshold for “substantial”
evidence in interpreting Bayes factors. Because we adopt the approach of Dienes (2014)
throughout the paper, we find it most appropriate and consistent to employ the threshold of
three that he recommends. In the context of acknowledging that the Bayes factors provides a
continuous measure rather than a strict cutoff point, we now acknowledge that other authorities
have opted for alternative thresholds.
Van Elk raises another good point with regard to religious vs. non-religious participants. In our
proposal, we did not dwell upon the possibility of a substantive deficit of religious participants,
largely because the results of our pilot study were so promising. Out of 209 respondents, only 91
qualified as non-religious based on the criteria we specified. Thus, in that sample, 56.5% of
participants qualified as religious. Constructing a 95% confidence interval around that proportion
suggests a lower bound of .498 for religiosity in the population. Notwithstanding that promising
25
result, our final sample could certainly be quite lower. To address that possibility, if, following
exclusions based on other criteria (p. 14 of the proposal), the sample for an experiment contains
fewer than 310 eligible religious participants (40%), we will continue running subjects until we
reach 932 total participants for that experiment, at which point our resources will be exhausted.
We have revised our procedure (p. 14-15) to reflect this.
Regarding van Elk’s final point about a categorical vs. continuous measure of religiosity, we
agree that there are multiple approaches available. Indeed, this is a point made by Shariff and
colleagues in their meta-analysis of religious priming studies. We have no strong philosophical
commitment to either approach, but favor the procedure described in the proposal because it
mirrors the procedure employed by Shariff & Norenzayan (Study 2) which we are in part
replicating, and because the Shariff et al. meta-analysis dichotomized religiosity as well.

Associate Editor
Comments to the Author:
Thanks for submitting your Stage 2 manuscript. Before we can continue to in-depth review,
please address the following points and resubmit:
1. The Introduction and wording of the hypotheses appears to have been altered in several places.
While most of these changes appear to be stylistic, it is important for RRs that no unnecessary
changes are made to study rationale or predictions apart from (a) correction of factual errors, or
(b) change of tense. Please adjust accordingly, reverting to the text of the original submission
where appropriate or flagging clearly (in a tracked changes supplement) where necessary
changes were made.
2. Since your manuscript received Stage 1 IPA in 2017, RSOS instituted a policy that requires
authors to register the accepted Stage 1 manuscript in a recognised repository at the point of
acceptance. This policy was not active at the time that IPA was awarded, but please ensure that
the accepted Stage 1 manuscript (unchanged from point of acceptance) is deposited in your OSF
archive and made public. From looking at your OSF page, it appears that you may have done so
already, however the registration appears to be privately embargoed. Please make the
registration public, or provide a view-only link that reviewers can access so that they can have
the accepted Stage 1 manuscript in hand as they review your Stage 2 submission.
Once these adjustments are made your manuscript will be returned immediately to the original
reviewers.

Dear Thadcha:
Thanks to you and Professor Chambers for clarifying the Journal's position on revisions of a
manuscript's Introduction. We understand, and are pleased to submit a revision that we believe is
in accord with your wishes. The text of the Introduction now reflects that of the original
submission, except for shifts to the past tense and the correction of one factual error (page 7 of
what is now the revised submission now omits an erroneous statement--namely, that van Elk et
al.'s meta-analysis included studies other than those meta-analysed by Shariff et al). Based on my
understanding of your instructions, I have submitted a supplemental document that retains
tracked changes to the Introduction, so you should be able to view any changes we made to it.
With regard to the accepted Stage 1 manuscript, this is available at the location we reference in
the manuscript itself: https://osf.io/6nqwt/. That study was made public on 7 June 2018, and
appears to be publicly accessible now based on the check that I just made. The accepted proposal
document is "Implicit and Explicit Influences of Religious Cognition on Dictator Game Transfers

Otherwise, I believe we should be all set. Thank you for your patience.

Review Implicit and Explicit Influences of Religious Cognition on Dictator Game Transfers
I was pleased to see how this work progressed and the care and effort the authors took in
analyzing the data, and finishing the manuscript. The main conclusions are clear and appear
warranted in light of the data presented. I only have a few requests and recommendations.
The classification of participants as religious or non-religious was based on an assignment to
either group according to their score on a belief in god scale. Although this makes sense, it would
be interesting to know to what extent the results (i.e., most notably the effect of explicit religious
priming for religious participants) hinges on this classification. Maybe the authors could conduct
a ‘robustness analysis’ (i.e., using different classification criteria) to determine the potential
boundary conditions of the effects they reported?
Overall, the authors conducted a large number of statistical tests. I wondered whether some
correction for multiple comparisons should be applied, i.e., by correcting the BF or the p-values.
This seems especially important given the fact that one of the main conclusions (i.e., effect of
explicit religious priming for religious participants) hinges on not very convincing BFs and rather
small effect sizes.
The authors did not proceed with an analysis, excluding participants who showed awareness of
the aim of the study based on the suspicion probe. The argument for not conducting this analysis
is that the main hypotheses were not confirmed. Still, it might be interesting to know to what
extent a similar (absence of an) effect is observed while excluding participants who correctly
guessed the hypothesis. This seems especially relevant in light of a recent replication report on
the Dijksterhuis et al., professor priming study
(http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691618755704), in which it was found that
implicit priming might exert a small effect (on correct answers on Trivia questions) – only for
participants who were not aware of the aim of the study.
I think the conclusion about a main effect of religiosity on prosocial behavior (i.e., amount of
money transferred) deserves more attention and could be mentioned in the abstract and in the
general discussion. This finding is important given the discussion to what extent the relation
between religiosity and prosociality is mainly limited to self-report measures, or extends to actual
behavioral measures of prosociality as well.
Overall I found the manuscript quite lengthy and at some points too extensive / too detailed. For
29
me it would be helpful if the manuscript could somehow highlight the most relevant analyses
and results, while still including the necessary additional information. I appreciate the authors’
efforts in providing a very accurate and representative account of their preregistered study, but
the manuscript could definitely be improved on getting the message across. In my view the most
essential findings are (1) religious participants donate more money, (2) implicit priming does not
increase prosocial behavior among religious and non-religious participants, (3) a new meta-
analysis does indicate that there is no effect of implicit religious priming on prosocial behavior,
(4) explicit religious priming might increase prosocial behavior for religious participants,
although the effect is small and the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated (but it is
probably not belief in supernatural punishment that is driving the effect). Maybe one idea would
be to point readers more directly to where they can find the relevant information to support each
of these claims, because it took me quite some time to figure out which part of the results section
supported each of these claims.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Professor Chris Chambers):
Comments to the Author:
The Stage 2 manuscript was returned to one of the original reviewers from Stage 1 (the other
reviewer was unavailable). The comments of the reviewer are below, and I have also re-read the
manuscript the myself. The reviewer makes three categories of recommendation.
32
First - the reviewers offers some useful suggestions for additional exploratory analyses, including
an additional robustness check on the religiosity classification, and an analysis specifically in
participants who demonstrated explicit awareness. I think there is merit in these suggestions;
however please note that the Stage 2 RR policy does not require authors to conduct additional
exploratory analyses unless they are necessary to support the conclusions. In this case, I judge
that these analyses are not necessary to justify the claims in the paper, however I do think they
would strengthen the article so I would recommend giving them careful consideration.
Second - the reviewer raises the question of whether correction for multiple comparisons should
be applied. Where this applies to preregistered tests and deviates from the approved protocol,
they should not be applied retrospectively, however an additional exploratory analysis (or
footnote) could be included to report the robustness of the outcomes under different assumed
levels of Type I error correction. Again, I will leave you to judge the appropriateness of this
course of action.
Finally - and most importantly in my view, the reviewer suggests that the key messages in the
results might be surfaced more prominently. I think this is an excellent suggestion, and I will
leave it to you to decide how to respond, but one approach would be to include an overview of
the key outcomes at the very start of the Results section, e.g. a section called "Overview of Key
Findings" section or something similar, following the reviewer's suggestion of highlighting those
findings and pointing to the specific sections of the Results containing the details, followed by the
current presentation of outcomes.
Provided these comments are addressed thoroughly in the revised manuscript and/or response,
final Stage 2 acceptance should be forthcoming without requiring futher in-depth review.

Comments to the Author:
Three expert reviewers have now assessed the manuscript, including one author of
the original study that forms the basis of the current proposal (Ara Norenzayan). All
reviewers find merit in the proposed study and recommend revision. However, all
raise significant issues that require careful consideration.
Reviewer 1 (Vassilis) offers a broad critical perspective, questioning the utility of the
overall approach as well as critiquing a number of specific methodological details
(including the use of the dictator game). Reviewer 2 (van Elk) is overall positive but
questions the breadth of the Introduction and also notes the lack of clarity in the
specific hypotheses underlying each experiment (these should be specified clearly in
every case). The reviewer also queries whether sufficient manipulation checks
(outcome-neutral conditions) are in place. Reviewer 3 (Norenzayan) makes an
important point about statistical power, and the authors should ensure that in each
experiment the scientific hypotheses map clearly on to the structure of the statistical
tests; thus, the power analysis should (if I understand correctly) correspond to highest
level interaction within the 3 x 2 design structure, as well as any subsequent simple
main effects for specific sub-hypotheses. The study should also be powered to detect
the lowest expected effect size (as the reviewer notes, the estimate corrected for
publication bias seems appropriate). A power of at least 0.9 should be achieved for all
hypothesis test, and/or the authors may also wish to consider a complementary
Bayesian approach to ensure interpretability of negative results and an efficient
sampling strategy (e.g. https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-

Finally, please ensure that the inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants (and
where applicable, data within participants) are comprehensively detailed as these can
generally not be altered after in principle acceptance.
Thank you for this summary. We address each of those points, and others, below. As
you will see, we make extensive use of the Bayesian methodology of Dienes in the
revised proposal, and provide detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Comments to the Author(s)
Replication of previous existing, in particular influential, research, as well as pre-
registration of the expectations and the planned methodology and analyses, are
important steps ahead for the progress of science, including psychology. The
research question, not to say area, of the links between religion and prosociality, has
been ongoing for many decades, though with some changes in methodology and
theoretical frameworks that envelop the, otherwise, in my opinion, classic and still the
same, but still important, specific research ideas and hypotheses. The proliferation of
reviews and meta-analyses of this research in the last five years attests of the
importance of this research topic and of the fact that some issues remain unanswered
or debatable. Thus, the authors should be applauded for the manuscript submitted to
the Royal Society Open Science, and for carefully designing and thoughtfully
justifying the methodology of the experiments planned.
Below, I will focus exclusively on some serious concerns I have not on the quality and
pertinence of the studies planned if the goal is only to strictly replicate one particular
work (Shariff & Norenzayan, 2007; therefore, S&N, 2017), but on the limited
significance of the future findings (whatever they will be) if the goal is to provide an
important, possibly definitive, answer on the question of whether religious priming
increases prosociality (what seems to be the goal of the authors if we read, e.g., the
abstract).
The general observation that can be made is that by focusing too narrowly to the
goal of replicating one study (S&N, 2007) or kinds of studies (ones that used the
Dictator game paradigm), the authors seem to have missed the broader picture
(many other studies, numerous more theoretical issues) that makes the religious
prosociality research question a much more complex issue that asks for more
nuances than the ideas the authors aim to test here in their planned replication
studies. Not that the latter is not legitimate to be done, but the findings of the
planned experiments, whatever may turn out to be, could not be considered as
providing an unambiguous and definitive answer on the religious prosociality
question.
We thank Saroglou for providing us with an opportunity to clarify the aims and
objectives of the proposed studies. Our focus is a body of experimental studies
generally interpreted to show an effect of religious priming upon prosocial behavior
and used, along with other evidence, to support a
model of social evolution in which religion marked by powerful, moralizing deities
was a causal contributor to the rise of large-scale societies marked by widespread
cooperation between strangers. The “religious prosociality question”—which we
understand to be the notion that “religious belief or concepts lead to prosocial
attitudes and behaviors” (Galen, 2012, p. 876) is a broad issue, involving multitudes of
methods, variables, and proposed moderators. Likewise, the cultural evolutionary
model of prosocial religion put forth by Norenzayan and colleagues (e.g. Norenzayan
et. al. 2016), draws upon evidence from multiple fields—as van Elk and Norenzayan
note in their comments—including anthropology and history. We make no pretense
of engaging all aspects of the religious prosociality question and answering it
definitively, just as we make no pretense of addressing the full array of evidence
brought to bear on Norenzayan et al.’s 2016 model. Instead, our target is the set of
experimental studies frequently claimed to provide strong support for an effect of
religious priming upon prosociality (Galen, 2012; Shariff et al., 2016; Norenzayan et
al., 2016; 2 Current Opinion pieces); in some cases, these effects are understood to be
restricted to believers or in-group member; in other cases, not. As we note in our
Introduction, however, the results of some meta-analyses and replications call into
question the supposed robustness of this experimental evidence. We put forth the
current studies in the hope of clarifying this ongoing uncertainty. In our view, it is
best to build up a body of evidence step by step. Saroglou suggests that our
proposed treatment is too narrow, but we would ask in return: “How are we to answer
a broader question definitively, if an important but circumscribed sub-question is
mired in controversy?” We proceed by identifying an empirical question—does
religious priming increase dictator game transfers—that, although narrow, is
nonetheless crucial to answer definitively, if broader theories regarding social
evolution are to stand atop a firm foundation. Although critics may argue with the
choice of the DG, it has played a prominent role in the religious priming literature,
and that alone justifies its use here. We acknowledge that research will be needed to
determine whether reported effects using other paradigms may be more or less
robust, but such careful, systematic expansion of knowledge is the basis of the
scientific enterprise. The diversity of priming methods precludes us from testing all
methods simultaneously, just as we are unable to test all behavioral paradigms.
Nonetheless, we have set out to test one of the most widely used implicit priming
paradigm; explicit priming methods are more diverse, but we have sought to make a
reasonable choice there as well.
Some of these thoughts are reflected in pp. 13-14 of the revised manuscript.
1. Too narrow focus on a limited part of previous research
Inserting their theorization into a more general framework of research, theory, and
various methodological alternatives of the religion (religious priming) and prosociality
hypothesis will help the authors to better evaluate what exactly their goal is and
possibly reconsider some decisions they took for the planned studies. For instance, in
parallel to S&N, in 2007, another independent work was published also showing
effects of religious priming on prosociality (Pichon et al., 2007, EJSP; cited 234 times),
but using other theoretical bases, religious primes, and measures of prosocial
inclination. Moreover, several review chapters/articles on religion and prosociality
have been published in the last years (by first authors other than S&N, i.e. Batson,
Galen, Preston, Saroglou, Tsang; none of them cited here) that point out issues that
seem not to have been taken into consideration by the authors. As it will appear
below, this has direct implications on some of the decisions the authors made and
thus the possible implications of their future findings.
We appreciate Saroglou’s well-taken point that the research on religious prosociality
is much broader than our earlier Introduction allowed. We have revised the
Introduction to acknowledge the breadth of issues bearing on the question of
religious prosociality, citing several of the sources that Saroglou helpfully draws
attention to. The revised Introduction then defines and justifies the focus of the
proposed studies as described above. See pp. 3-4 of the revised manuscript.
2. Prosociality towards whom?
2.1. It is highly questionable that using a Dictator game is the best (even, the
appropriate) way to examine the religious prosociality hypothesis. The DG implies
giving to anonymous others. However, as Saroglou et al. (2005, JSSR; cited 279 times)
found (see Blogowska & Saroglou, 2011, JSSR, Study 2, for replication; cited 52 times),
religiosity relates to prosocial inclinations toward ingroup members and people with
whom one is in regular interaction but does not extend to unknown persons. This is
also a major conclusion of Galen’s (2012, Psy Bull; cited 158 times) review.
Saroglou’s comments regarding the possible circumscription of prosociality to in-
group members are well-taken, and we have revised our Introduction to acknowledge
this research (page 4). However, the methodological paradigm of the Dictator Game
is justified in our studies for several reasons. First, DG studies figure prominently in
the experimental priming literature used to support Norenzayan et al.’s model of
social evolution in which religions marked by powerful, moralizing deities play a
causal role in driving the emergence of large-scale cooperative societies. Shariff and
Norenzayan’s (2007) studies are oft-cited, as we note in our Introduction (see
revisions on page 7), and are joined by other studies such as those of Ahmed & Salas
(2011) and Benjamin et al. (2010). Indeed, in the Shariff et al. (2016) meta-analysis of
the effect of religious priming upon prosociality—often cited in support of the
cultural evolutionary model (Norenzayan et al., 2016)—there are 25 total studies
included. Twelve of these studies—nearly half—involve implicit priming, and of those
implicit priming studies, six—fully half—use the DG. To the extent that our studies are
concerned with the effect of implicit religious priming upon prosociality, and to the
extent that implicit religious priming is used to buttress broader claims of social
evolution (which is frequently), use of the DG is not only justified, but essential.
Second, and relatedly, the Shariff et al. (2016) meta-analysis reports an effect of
religious priming upon prosociality irrespective of the target of benevolence; those
authors acknowledge, as will we, that they are not claiming any effect of religious
prosociality must be universal in scope. Third, it must be said that the evidence
suggesting circumscription of religious prosociality to in-group members, while
strong, is hardly beyond debate. In discussing Norenzayan et al.’s cultural
evolutionary model, McKay & Whitehouse (2016) cite three studies indicating that
religious prosociality can extend beyond in-group, boundaries, and Norenzayan et al.
(2016) add two further studies into the mix. We regard use of the DG as essential to
our studies because of their prominent use in the literature; even if this were not the
case, the above studies suggest that it is premature to disqualify the DG as a
methodological paradigm in this context solely on the view that religious prosociality
necessarily extends only to in-group members.
2.2. Moreover, theoretically, it has been argued that religion should imply prosociality
more clearly when the target is a person in need (Saroglou, 2013, APA Hbk review
chapter; cited 54 times). In most if not all studies on religious prosociality in Saroglou
and coll.’s lab, be they focused on individual religiosity or religious priming effects,
the target is a person in need (see Saroglou et al., 2005; Pichon et al., 2007; Pichon &
Saroglou, 2009; Blogowska & Saroglou, 2011, 2013; Blogowska et al., 2013). In some
of them, the target makes an explicit request to be helped; in others not.
Saroglou again draws attention to an important aspect of the scientific study of
religious prosociality. As with the theme of an in-group bias of religious prosociality,
we have revised our Introduction to acknowledge the target’s need state as an
important moderator of religiously motivated—or, indeed, probably any—prosocial
behavior (see page 4). However, we again justify our design on the grounds that
published meta-analyses of the effect of religious priming on prosociality (Shariff et
al., 2016; van Elk et al., 2015) report effects irrespective of target need state, and these
meta-analyses play a prominent role in evaluating evidence bearing on cultural
evolutionary models of prosocial religion and large-scale societies. We welcome
future research that might clarify the role of target need state in effects reported in
the existing meta-analyses, but such research is beyond the scope of the current
studies.
2.3. Consequently, my recommendation will be that either the authors explicitly
restrict their ambition in only testing the replicability of S&N (2007) experiment that
is limited to generosity toward unknown and not in need targets and thus explicitly
acknowledge that this cannot fully or even appropriately address the general
religious prosociality hypothesis. Or, alternatively, or preferably, that the authors
change their methodological paradigm for one where religious prosociality is tested
in reference to (ingroup) persons in need.
We agree that it is important to acknowledge that our studies will not address
important themes, including whether religious prosociality is preferentially directed
toward in-group members, and to what extent religious prosociality is moderated by
target need state. We do so on pp. 13-14. At the same time, we clarify (pp. 13-14 that
our results do bear on published meta-analyses where effects are reported without
regard for the above factors, and on cultural evolutionary models of religious
prosociality and large-scale societies to the extent that these models draw upon the
existing experimental evidence that religious priming affects prosociality.
3. Priming what?
3.1. Previous research in the last 10 years on the effects of religious priming on social
behavior in general, and prosocial one in particular, has often pointed out the
importance to distinguish (or at least to be aware of the distinction) between
different kinds of religious priming, e.g. ones denoting individual vs. social religion;
coalitional and institutional religion vs. spirituality and faith; benevolent vs.
malevolent images of God; and ones with positive vs. negative valence. I presume the
authors are aware of these distinctions. Do the decisions the authors took for all
religious words/texts (in the implicit priming, the reading, and the writing an essay
conditions) take into account that previous research? (I do not mean that the authors
have to adopt these distinctions, but to justify their choice; for instance, my opinion is
that religious priming in people’s life is a “package” that includes all the above
mentioned aspects; thus, it is legitimate to examine what the priming of this package
has as effects).
Saroglou raises an important issue regarding various mechanisms through which
religious priming may exert its (putative) effects on prosociality. We agree with him
and thank him for his reminder of the need to justify the choices of particular primes.
We do so as follows. First, the choice to use the same implicit primes as Shariff &
Norenzayan et al. (2007) followed from the influence of that particular study (more
than 500 citations, though we now acknowledge and cite other early and influential
studies, such as Pichon et al. (2007) and Randolph-Seng & Nielsen (2007)); from its
role as experimental evidence used in support of cultural evolutionary models of
religious prosociality and large-scale cooperative societies; from recent questions
concerning the replicability of implicit priming studies in general; and from specific
questions arising from a recent failed replication attempt of Shariff & Norenzayan in
particular (Gomes & McCullough, 2015). See pp. 7-8 and pp. 11-12. Second, the use
of general essays as exemplars of explicit priming is justified precisely because of the
diversity of possible mechanisms that Saroglou notes. Multiple mechanisms may be
at work, and the meta-analysis of Shariff et al. 2016—used in support of Norenzayan
et al’s cultural evolutionary model—reports effects irrespective of mechanism.
Norenzayan comments below that he and colleagues favor a role for supernatural
punishment, rather than benevolence, as the key driver of religious priming effects,
but published effect sizes are reported regardless of mechanism, and research
regarding the role of supernatural punishment is ongoing. Because of the diversity of
possible mechanisms (enumerated by Saroglou), we note (pp. 12) that a general
essay-based prime is well-suited to explicitly prime religion in terms of whatever
“package” (to use Saroglou’s phrase) is pertinent to the study participant, and thus to
prime religion to the same extent as the average explicit priming study included in
Shariff et al.’s meta-analysis, where—again—prosocial effects are reported
irrespective of mechanism.
Saroglou’s concerns (shared by Norenzayan in his Comment 3) are perhaps
most apropos of reading primes, where specific reading passages may well activate
specific mechanisms not addressed by broader theory. In our original Introduction,
we noted problems inherent to the use of reading passages, and we have addressed
these problems in a manner suggested by Norenzayan (Comment 3)—by eliminating
the reading primes in favor of essays as the sole explicit primes.
Finally, although we feel that our study is justified and much-needed in light
of meta-analyses that report religious priming effects regardless of mechanism,
further research on mechanism, including the possibility of supernatural punishment,
is certainly welcome. Therefore, we have expanded our study design to investigate
the hypothesis that participants’ views of God as punishing and authoritarian vs.
benevolent and merciful drive religious priming effects on prosocial behavior. See pp.
12-13, Prediction 4 on p. 20, and pp. 27-28, along with our response to Norenzayan
Comment 1B for details.
3.2. It seems though that there will be high variability between the specific nature of
the religious ideas primes between the three religious conditions (primed words as in
S&N; passage of the Transfiguration; unknown content of the essay). Thus, given this
potentially important content variability, I doubt that firm conclusions can be made
on the role of the specific nature of the priming (implicit vs. explicit). Would not it be
better if the authors try to have a design with the same/similar religious ideas across
the religious conditions?
This is an excellent point by Saroglou. We have mitigated the concern somewhat by
eliminating reading primes. And we justify the use of our implicit and general essay-
based primes above, in our response to Comment 3.1.
3.3. The choice of the biblical passage of the Transfiguration of Jesus may not be
optimal. I understand, to some extent, the authors’ concern not to have a biblical
passage clearly evoking prosocial values but choosing a passage that clearly
describes a paranormal phenomenon would potentially activate mixed feelings to
participants depending on their degree of rationalism, form or religiosity or
irreligiosity, and openness to the paranormal.
As noted earlier, we have elected not to include any explicit primes based upon
reading passages.
3.3.2. BTW: no reference is made in the Introduction on previous studies having used
the reading of biblical vs. control texts to activate/enhance prosociality. A too rapid
reader may get the impression room” that the authors here are the first who
imagined such methodological strategy (see wording in p. 7).
We apologize for giving that impression; that was certainly not our intention. We
appreciate the comment, and would of course revise accordingly, but as noted earlier
we have eliminated explicit primes based upon reading passages.
3.4. I wonder whether asking people to “sort items they have in their home,
apartment, or dormitory room” is an optimal strategy for the essay-based control
condition—especially since the authors seem to make a maximal effort for having
religious ideas fully exempt of any prosocial connotation. It is not excluded (it is in
fact very likely) that people will have in their apartment and mention items highly
relevant to the self (what may refer to values, life goals, and interests) or even family’s
and relatives’ pictures, what of course may activate things like community belonging,
ingroup, etc. Or, on the contrary, medals and awards that may accentuate self-
esteem, pride, and possibly self-centeredness. All these may make important noise if
it is to compare with a religious condition expected to enhance generosity.
We acknowledge that a certain amount of noise may arise from the essay-writing
approach, but we argue that a bit of noise is inevitable no matter the essay topic. On
the whole, describing household contents should prove neutral enough, and has
been used in prior religious priming research (McCullough et al., 2012).
4. Religious prosociality: if yes, for which causes?
4.1. The manuscript starts by the following sentence: “Does religion promote
prosocial behavior by restraining selfish implications” (abstract)? This is misleading.
First, the paper (and planned studies do not focus on cases, motivations, and
underlying processes. Second, as concluded in previous reviews of extensive research
(Saroglou, 2012, 2013), whereas there is substantial evidence that religious
prosociality exists but that is limited in scope and conditional, there is no evidence
(and if anything there is suggestive evidence for the contrary) that religious
prosocaility is based on altruistic, other-oriented and not selfish, self-oriented,
motives.
We appreciate this comment, and agree that our studies are not primarily intended to
address mechanisms or underlying motivations. We have revised the abstract and the
Introduction to eliminate the initial reference to “selfishness,” which indeed over-
reaches. We believe that the new text clearly identifies and reflects the goals of the
studies as described in our response to Saroglou’s initial “general observation.” And,
as noted above in response to Comment 3.1, we have introduced an analysis that
considers supernatural punishment as a possible mechanism.
4.2. As far as the S&N 2007 work is concerned, note that the supernatural controlling
agent hypothesis (“God is watching you”) was in that study only a speculative
interpretation; nothing was tested in that work that could really substantiate this
interpretation. I have not followed on details all the recent experiments to be today
sure that there is now substantial proof that this mechanism explains (or even fully
explains) the religion-prosociality link. However, what seems obvious, is that, form a
strictly social psychological of prosocial behavior perspective, even if the above is an
important explanatory process (accompanied by the Big God hypothesis at the
societal evolution level), it constitutes only one among a dozen if not dozens of
possible explanatory processes and mechanisms of religious prosociality (see Batson’s
work; see also Saroglou, 2013; and Preston et al., 2014). Even if in the last few years,
the Big God hypothesis is at the center of hot debates, the authors may reconsider
whether, from a strictly psychological perspective, it is necessary, sufficient, useful, or
well-justified to build the importance of their planned experiments (only) on the Big
God hypothesis.
We agree that the hypothesis of supernatural monitoring as a mechanism for
religious priming of prosociality remains a matter for continued research, and
certainly was not established by the results of Shariff & Norenzayan (2007). However,
we do think that the ambitious cultural evolutionary model of religious prosociality
put forth, for instance, by Norenzayan and colleagues, and other models offered by,
for example, Johnson (2005; 2011; 2014) and Johnson and Krueger (2004) have quite
rightly generated vigorous debate and careful consideration, as recently exemplified
by the discussion surrounding Norenzayan et al. (2016). Our studies focus primarily
on key aspects of experimental evidence offered in support of those models.
Furthermore, we note that ongoing concerns with replicability of published findings,
particularly in the priming literature as a whole, lend additional import and urgency
to these studies. Finally, we argue that the results of our studies will have some
relevance for experimental investigators of religious prosociality beyond the cultural
evolutionary model of prosocial religiosity, although we acknowledge that our studies
do not engage all possible key themes, such as a ingroup biases and target need
state. Our introduction has been extensively revised to make these points. Altogether,
we feel that the studies will contribute meaningfully to current and important
scientific debates.
5. Other, less critical, issues
5.1. The authors state in p. 4: “S&N’s experiments have inspired a large body of work
on the behavioural effects of religious priming”. Are they sure of this attribution? May
his attribution suffer from some ethnocentrism or ingroup-limited in scope picture?
This sounds if not inaccurate, at least excessive, when one takes into account first
important previous to 2007 work, including experimental one, on religious
prosociality; second the fact that the same year (2007) two other studies on religious
priming and their effects on social (prosocial and moral) behavior were published in
international journals; and third, that two, if not more, studies on religious priming
and its effects (I think one was on perception/attention) were published in the early
2000s again in international journals.
We thank Saroglou for this comment, and have revised our Introduction to
acknowledge the broader body of early religious priming studies, particularly Pichon
et al. (2007) and Randolph-Seng & Nielsen (2007), and to situate Shariff &
Norenzayan more properly amidst this broader corpus while providing empirical
support for claims that the studies are Shariff & Norenzayan are indeed influence. See
pp. 7-8.
5.2. I fully understand and share Gomes & McCullough’s concern (as cited in p. 5) not
to have too explicit religious words. But the alterative, that is to use words (like
“spirit”) that may have a religious/spiritual or secular meaning (except if I
misunderstand something here) seems also problematic. Why not to adopt here in
the planed experiments subliminal priming? (Thus, the same words, in subliminal vs.
supraliminal vs. explicit reading conditions could possibly be a better test—in
reference to my point on 3.2.)
An excellent suggestion, but regrettably limited resources and a need to maximise
available power preclude us from featuring too many conditions. We feel that the
implicit and explicit conditions we have selected are appropriate given the
justification we provided in responding to Comments 3.1 and 3.2. We would add here
that the meta-analysis conducted by Shariff et al. (2016) suggests that if anything
subliminal priming may produce effects weaker than those produced by implicit and
explicit priming. Hence, we have refrained from testing the religious priming
hypothesis at points that many of its proponents suspect may be its weakest.
In conclusion, though my comments may appear numerous, and at first glance
possibly a bit severe, I would like to confirm to the authors my belief that their goal is
to be applauded and encouraged and I hope they will find my comments useful.
And am happy to sign this review (Vassilis Saroglou)—Thanks for the comments!

Comments to the Author(s)
Review Implicit and Explicit Influences of Religious Cognition
This registered report proposes a study to establish the effect of religious priming on
prosocial behavior. The authors propose to conduct two studies using two different
versions of the dictator game, to increase the likelihood of selfish behavior as the
baseline in these tasks. Three different religious priming manipulations are proposed,
involving an implicit prime (scrambled sentence task), and two explicit primes
(reading a text or writing an essay).
1. I think this is an important and scientifically relevant research project. The authors
rightly point out that currently the debate over the efficacy of religious priming is still
not settled and that pre-registered replication studies are a solution to this problem.
At the same time, I am skeptical regarding the outcomes of this study. My concern is
that (similar to the author’s previous work) the studies will likely yield a null-result.
However, rather than settling the debate once and for all, this will likely only trigger
more debate and criticism regarding the specifics of this study. Although the authors
go to great effort to address potential concerns (i.e., by including both implicit and
explicit priming; by conducting a meta-analysis only over the pre-registered studies),
still this will not refute the highly contaminated literature on this topic.
My first recommendation would be to turn this project into an adversarial
collaboration if possible. If the original authors can be involved in the study design,
they should also acknowledge and accept the outcomes – irrespective of whether a
positive or a null-result is obtained. An adversarial collaboration would greatly
enhance the credibility of the project to the broader scientific community. Eventually,
I would also recommend to ask the original authors to disclose their raw data to the
scientific community. This would be important to establish that no gender-differences
underlie the effects observed.
We thank van Elk for his comments here and share his view that both studies will
produce a null result. Indeed, that is what we expect. The question then becomes one
of how to interpret a null result. In our revised proposal, and in response to the
suggestion of the editor, we have adopted the Bayesian framework of Dienes (2014),
which provides a method for distinguishing evidence favoring the null hypothesis
from merely insensitive data. In our response to Norenzayan Comment #2 and on
pages 20-28 of our revised proposal, we furnish extensive details on exactly how we
will apply the recommendations of Dienes (2014) to the studies. Without this
Bayesian approach, even a null result obtained through an adversarial collaboration
would be inconclusive—as Dienes (2014) notes, such a result might merely indicate
insensitive data rather than evidence favoring the null. With this Bayesian approach,
all readers will be able to determine how much, if at all, they should adjust their
posterior distributions of the probable effect size of religious priming on Dictator
Game transfers, in response to the findings of our studies.
However, I also realize that setting up an adversarial collaboration might be difficult
and agree that this project would still provide an important contribution without the
consent of the original authors. I have a few major concerns that can hopefully be
used to improve the research design and proposal.
2. First, the Introduction now focuses somewhat narrowly on the topic of religious
priming and prosocial behavior. The relevance of this topic for the scientific study of
religion remains underspecified. For instance, the notion that religion primarily
evolved as an adaptation to foster moral and prosocial behavior does not only hinge
on religious priming studies. A wide range of evidence could be cited and
complementary lines of evidence from different fields are available (e.g., historical,
anthropological, sociological etc.). As such, the presence / absence of religious
priming effects would not be a fatal blow to the theory. Thus, it would be important
to place the religious priming studies in context, and to discuss theories related to
supernatural punishment, the relation between religion and morality etc. in more
depth.
We appreciate this feedback and note that it echoes comments 1B and 1C from
Norenzayan and Saroglou Comment 1. In response, we have revised our Introduction
to acknowledge the broad body of evidence bearing the theory of religious
prosociality as a cultural evolutionary process (pp. 3-6). Our studies from the start
were intended to focus on certain empirical claims offered in support of the theory of
religious prosociality,but we never presumed that our two studies would be capable
of delivering a “fatal blow” to such an expansive theoretical program. We welcome
the opportunity clarify this and have revised our Introduction to highlight van Elk’s
point that the theory boasts an array of evidence, from many disciplines. Specifically,
our revised Introduction notes for instance that Norenzayan et al. (2016) adduced
four major lines of evidence in support of their theory of the cultural evolution of
prosocial religions: ethnographic, archaeological, historical, and psychological, with
the psychological evidence consisting of both correlational and experimental studies
(pp. 3-4). Our revised Introduction makes clear that our studies bear specifically on
aspects of the experimental evidence from psychology often offered in support of the
theory (p. 10; pp. 12-13). Although contributing to only one pillar of support for the
overarching theory of religious prosociality, the religious priming literature is
nonetheless important to the theory. (For one thing, as the proponents of the theory
themselves note, priming evidence is key in that it can establish causality, unlike the
correlational evidence.) As our original and revised Introductions also make clear,
there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the evidence produced by that
literature may be weaker (e. g. van Elk, 2015; Gomes & McCullough, 2016) than it is
often understood—and characterized—to be (e.g. Shariff et al., 2016; Norenzayan et
al., 2016; Willard et al., 2016)). Clarifying the existence and magnitude of the effect of
religious priming upon prosociality is thus an urgent need. The two studies proposed
here are intended to contribute toward that end.
3. In the Introduction the authors discuss the ‘enhanced religious priming’ condition,
in which words were presented without a religious context. However, from the
examples that the authors provide, it seems that in the ‘enhanced religious priming’
condition, the critical words are used metaphorically and thereby completely lose
their ‘religious’ association (e.g., ‘she had high spirit’ would not activate any religious
concept whatsoever). Thus, to me it is not surprising that this condition did not yield
any result.
We actually agree. The condition was included in the study undertaken by Gomes &
McCullough (2015), and was briefly referenced in our Introduction only to provide
thorough background. It appears instead to have sowed confusion, so we have
deleted it.
4. At the end of the Introduction (in the section ‘Present research’) the authors discuss
the present study and describe the two explicit priming conditions. It would be
helpful to the reader if the authors would also describe which implicit priming
condition they intend to use – this information is now only presented in the methods
section.
The methods section now makes it clearer that the implicit priming conditions match
those of Shariff & Norenzayan (2007). Note also that in our revised proposal we have
eliminated reading-based explicit primes, and will use only essay-based explicit
primes. This revision is detailed in our response to Norenzayan comment 3.
5. I was missing specific hypotheses regarding the expected outcomes of the different
manipulations and studies. Do the authors anticipate stronger effects for explicit
compared to implicit religious priming conditions and why? Do the authors
hypothesize a stronger effect in Study 2 compared to Study 1, because there is more
room for ‘religious primes’ to exert an additional effect – to shape selfish behavior?
We greatly appreciate this comment, along with the reminder from the editor that
hypotheses should be clearly specified. We have done so with extensive revisions to
the Introduction, in which all predictions are clearly enumerated. See pages 19-20, as
well as p. 29.
6. At the start of the Methods section (‘Participants’) the authors mention a 3 x 2
between subjects design. Also at this point it would be helpful to already explicitly
mention which conditions the authors planned to include.
Our revised Introduction specifies the new design and makes clear the conditions
which are included. We now have a 2 (Priming Condition: Religious vs. Neutral) x 2
(Priming Method: Implicit vs. Explicit) x 2 (Participant Religiosity: Religious vs. Non-
religious) design. See page 14.
7. The authors describe a pre-test in which they measured the mean dictator money
transfer. It was unclear to me whether this test involved actual money. Also: how did
the researchers allocate money, because in my experience it can be quite hard to
make individual payments in MT. Also: MT workers typically expect to perform a task
for a fixed rate, so do they really believe that the payment will be adjusted based on
their decisions? A manipulation check would be important to investigate whether
participants really understand and believe the DG manipulation. This concern
obviously also applies to the main studies that the authors propose.
The pre-test did involve real money. JB executed individual payments manually based
on actual participant decisions, which was time-consuming but doable. We advertised
a fixed rate of $.50 for the work, plus the possibility of additional compensation. We
encountered no reason to suspect that participants were concerned about not
receiving the compensation due them as a result of the DG. We address this latter
issue in more detail in response to Norenzayan Comment 5B.
8. The authors mention the use of an implicit prime condition. However, it is left
unclear whether this involves the standard religious priming condition or the
‘enhanced religious priming’ condition that was mentioned in the Introduction.
As stated earlier, we have eliminated reference to the enhanced priming condition, to
improve clarity.
9. In the ‘reading-based-religious priming’ condition, I was missing a test /
manipulation check question to assess whether participants truly read the story and
remembered the information that was presented in the story.
This is an excellent suggestion, and we would certainly adopt the advice—except that
we have revised the proposal to eliminate all reading-based primes, as suggested by
Norenzayan and as described in more detail in our response to Norenzayan comment
3. Additionally, we have introduced a manipulation check for the essay-writing primes
(pp. 17-18, as well as a requirement that essays must be at least 50 words long (p.
14). And for the implicit primes, we check that the scrambled sentence tasks are
successfully completed (p. 14).
10. The ‘essay-based religious priming’ condition is quite lengthy compared to the
other manipulations (15 minutes). My suggestion would be to shorten the duration of
the task (e.g., 5 minutes) to make it better comparable to the other conditions.
We appreciate this feedback, and note that Norenzayan likewise suggested a five-
minute essay. We have adopted this suggestion, so that instructions for essay-based
primes now stipulate a five-minute writing period. See page 17 and Appendix A.
11. Insufficient information is provided regarding the framing of the different priming
manipulations. Which information will be presented to the participants regarding the
different priming tasks and how could this eventually affect the effects on the DG?
Also, it might be good to include a probe question at the end of the study to ask
participants what they think the relation is between the two different parts of the
study.
Framing of the priming manipulations is minimal. For implicit priming conditions,
framing will be as described in Appendix B. (Note that Appendix A has been modified
slightly so as to mirror the wording of Appendix B precisely.) For explicit priming
conditions, framing will be as shown in Appendix A, where we have added the
following text to mirror the framing of the implicit primes as closely as possible:
“Task 1: Please complete the following task. Do your best to complete the task.”
Reading primes have been eliminated in this revised proposal, as described in more
detail in our response to Norenzayan Comment 3. We appreciate the suggestion to
add a probe question, but think that our first probe item, “Briefly speculate on what
you think this study is about so far,” serves to elicit participants’ views on this matter
without actively increasing participants’ suspicion.
12. In the analysis, the authors propose to include both categorical and continuous
measures of religiosity. However, it remains unclear why two different types of
measures are necessary to investigate the potential moderating effect of religiosity.
We appreciate this comment, and have revised the proposal to use only one measure
of religiosity, a categorical one. Here we have followed the example of Shariff et al.
(2016), who treated religiosity as a dichotomous variable in their meta-analysis of
religious priming. In constructing this dichotomous variable, we follow the practice of
Shariff & Norenzayan (2007). Details may be found in our revised “Data Analysis”
section, page 20.
13. The authors propose to conduct a meta-analysis on pre-registered replication
studies only. However, it is unclear how many of these studies are available and
whether a meta-analysis is feasible for only a limited amount of studies. Please note
that we have two pre-registered studies with null-results available for inclusion in this
analysis!
Well, with van Elk’s two studies, our two studies, and Gomes & McCullough (2015),
that should be at least five! We agree that five studies—if indeed that is all we are
able to find—is not a lot. It is important to emphasize however, that pre-registered
studies eliminate one of the biggest obstacles to drawing accurate conclusions from a
meta-analysis—namely, publication bias. If based only on pre-registered studies, a
meta-analysis should provide more confidence than a meta-analysis that relies upon
a flawed literature. We will duly note limitations appropriate to our sample size,
whatever it ends up being, but it is indeed feasible to conduct a meta-analysis on as
few as five studies.
14. In Study 2, it is explained that participants in the DG have the option to take an
additional $0.50 from the other participant. However, it remains unclear to me (and
potentially also to the participant) what happens if both participants select the option
to take $0.50 from each other. How does this affect the credibility of the
manipulation?
We suspect that here van Elk may simply have misunderstood the task. As with Study
1, the participant in Study 2 plays the role of dictator in the DG. The anonymous
other is in the role of receiver and does nothing but end up on the receiving end of
the participant’s decision. So it is not possible for both participants to take money
from each other. The instructions we use—as we describe in more detail in response
to Norenzayan Comment 5B— adhere closely to the instructions of List (2007), who
successfully employed this paradigm. In general, we think it highly unlikely that
participants will have the incorrect understanding that the anonymous other is
empowered to take money from them.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a thoughtfully and important study proposal, and would make a valuable
contribution to the literature on religious priming. More broadly, it would also be an
important contribution to better understand the reproducibility of psychological
findings. Over the last several years, it has become quite clear to me that efforts like
this one are crucial for the health of the behavioral sciences, and Mike McCullough
and his students have been doing valuable work in exploring the replicability of
psychological findings. Below I offer some thoughts and recommendations with the
goal of further improving and refining the study design.
A Bit of Theory:
1A. I found the introductory section quite thorough, and the attention and care put
into the details of this literature is commendable. Since I was asked to review this
proposed study, I offer some thoughts, starting with theory. The theory that we have
been developing rests on the hypothesis that religious procosiality is a cultural
evolutionary process, meaning there is cultural and historical variability in whether
the supernatural and the moral are intertwined. So among foraging societies and
other smaller scale groups, for example, religion and prosociality are largely
disconnected (the gods are largely indifferent about moral affairs). In these
populations, the theory would predict a lack of any effect of religious reminders on
proosciality. It's the convergence between the supernatural and the moral that played
a role in large-scale cooperation (see Norenzayan et al, BBS, in press for a detailed
account; or Norenzayan, 2013, Big Gods, Chapter 7; Atran & Henrich, 2010). This is
important because the effect of religious reminders on DG offers (or any prosocial
behavior, for that matter) depend on people culturally inheriting a religious tradition
that connects religion with prosociality, and the claim is strongest for co-religionist
strangers (see Purzycki et al). 1B. Second, a growing body of evidence shows that the
main driver of this effect is belief in supernatural punishment (see Purzycki et al, 2015;
Shariff & Norenzayan, 2011; Yilmaz & Bahçekapili, 2016). Supernatural benevolence
either has no effect or has the opposite effect (that might reflect a kind of moral
licensing – one can be selfish or violate prosocial norms, and ask for forgiveness later
from a benevolent God or gods). Recent findings in this regard led us to refine our
theoretical framework since Shariff & Norenzayan (2007), as can be seen in the
publications mentioned above. 1C. Third, the question about the reproducibility of
religious priming (and social priming more broadly) is distinct from the question
about the origins of religious prosociality. There are several parts to the theoretical
framework, only one of which is the hypothesis about whether religious priming
increase prosocial behavior among strangers.
We greatly appreciate this elaboration of the theory of religious prosociality as a
cultural evolutionary process. Our proposed studies are intended in part to address
concerns with anonymity arising from prior research (particularly Gomes &
McCullough, 2015). Thus, we have sought to maximise anonymity in the present
design, which regrettably precludes us from testing the notion that religious priming
effects are greater for coreligionists (1A).
We appreciate in particular the theoretical emphasis on supernatural
punishment as a possible mechanism for the effect of religious priming (1B). We
certainly agree that further experimental evidence bearing on this hypothesized
mechanism would be valuable. We note, however, that current empirical claims about
the existence and magnitude of the effect of religious priming upon prosociality
(particularly Shariff et al., 2016, along with Norenzayan et al. (2016), and Willard et al.
(2016)) imply that the reported effect sizes obtain irrespective of mechanism—
supernatural punishment or otherwise. Indeed, the issue of punishment is not
addressed at all in the Shariff et al. (2016) meta-analysis of religious priming studies
involving prosociality (or other dependent measures, for that matter). The impetus
behind our proposal is to clarify the veracity of these published reports, and thus we
feel that the issue of supernatural punishment is not essential to the current studies.
Having said that, we welcome the opportunity to engage and advance the latest
theory in this area. Accordingly, we have revised our proposal to include the A/B-God
scale (Johnson et al., 2015), which assesses the extent to which participants
conceptualize God as primarily loving and merciful (the “Benevolent” sub-scale), vs.
punishing and wrathful (the “Authoritarian” sub-scale), along with appropriate
statistical tests. See pp. 12-13, Prediction 4 on p. 20, and pp. 27-28.
In Comment 1C, Norenzayan—like van Elk in his Comment 2—points out that
the theory contains multiple components, which are distinct from the reproducibility
of religious priming. We agree, and have inserted text in the Introduction to make
clear that the results of studies do not bear on all bodies of evidence related to the
theory, which (as van Elk notes) draws upon anthropology, history, and other fields.
For more details, see our response to van Elk Comment 2.
1D Of course, the rationale for the study using these primes is justified if the question
of interest is a better understanding of this particular effect’s replicability and its
parameters (that is the Shariff & Norenzayan, 2007 study). But the finding’s interest
value also importantly is about informing the theory, and theory points to reminders
that supernatural forces will punish if people do not follow group prosocial norms,
this belief increases prosociality among believers (but non-believers), and reminders
of a loving, forgiving god might drive the effect in the other direction. These
considerations are important in interpreting the relevance of an effect or a lack
thereof for confirming or disconfirming theory-deriven hypotheses.
As we noted in our response to Comment 1B, the impetus behind our proposal is to
clarify the veracity of published reports regarding the effects of religious priming
upon prosociality, effects which are reported irrespective of mechanism—a point that
we reiterate in our Introduction. We agree, however, that theoretical refinements are
relevant for interpreting whatever results are obtained. We have revised our
Introduction to note that it is limited in not examining all possible variables and
mechanisms of interest. In addition, as described earlier, we do now offer a
consideration of supernatural punishment as a possible mechanism.
Power:
2. It’s advisable to aim for more than .8 power and on the lower-bound estimate of
the meta-analytic effect after correcting for publication bias (not the unbiased effect
size). So we need sufficient statistical power to detect an effect of g=.18. Moreover,
this meta-analytic effect size is for the between-groups difference (control/prime).
Correct me if I am wrong, but comparing two groups of 125 per cell, would have 0.29
power to detect an effect of d= 0.18. The proposed 2- and 3-way interactions require
even more power to be detectable. Far more statistical power is needed to reach
conclusions about the reliability of this effect with confidence.
We agree with Norenzayan that power is an issue. We agree as well with the editor
and with van Elk that we must be prepared to interpret a potentially non-significant
result. To address these related concerns, we have adopted a two-pronged strategy.
First, we have increased power. Norenzayan suggests that the study should be
powered to detect an effect size of d = .18. We presume that this is based on the
findings of the Shariff et al. (2016) meta-analysis, in which d = .18 was the estimated
effect (after correcting for publication bias) for religious priming studies using
prosociality as an outcome measure. To achieve 90% power to detect an effect size of
.18 using a 2-tailed independent groups t test with alpha at .05 would require 650
participants per cell—or 1300 subjects for one comparison. (This would nearly equal
the total number of subjects included in the Gomes and McCullough meta-analysis of
all religious priming studies involving the Dictator Game, which is 1,466). As
Norenzayan commented in his review of our proposal, the matter is made worse if
interactions are contemplated, such as the interaction between religiosity and
religious priming. For an attenuation interaction such as this—in which the effect of
priming on the non-religious is expected to reduce to zero—achieving even 80%
power would require doubling the number of subjects per group (Carter &
McCullough, 2016). Thus, to detect the interaction at 80% power, we would need 650
* 6 * 2 = 7,800 subjects, for just one of our proposed studies. It should be noted that
7,800 subjects would represent a 65% increase in subjects over the entirety of all
previous online studies on religious priming as reported in the Shariff et al. (2016)
meta-analysis (4,709 subjects). Such a threshold is regrettably not attainable for us,
given our existing resources.
To advance research in this area while maximising available resources, we will
eliminate explicit priming conditions based on reading passages. As Norenzayan
notes (Comment 3), interpreting the meaning of any given reading passage is beset
with difficulty. Instead, we will rely on essay-based explicit primes, freeing up
resources that we apply toward increasing the sample size of the four remaining cells.
Furthermore, as van Elk et al. (2015) suggest, the religious priming hypothesis is
directional, so a one-tailed test is appropriate for significance tests. With these
adjustments, we are able to target 194 usable participants per cell. This improves
power to detect a main effect of d = .18 to 55%, while providing greater than 90%
power to detect a main effect of d = .30.
We acknowledge that our proposed sample size falls short of the number of
subjects needed to obtain 90% power to detect a main effect of d = .18, and
therefore the risk of obtaining a null result due to insensitive data is greater than
preferred. To address this issue, we adopt the Bayesian approach of Dienes (2014),
and thank the editor for the suggestion. As Dienes (2014) notes, a study with low a
priori power may end up successfully discriminating between hypotheses; conversely,
even high a priori power does not guarantee that the collected data will actually be
sensitive enough to distinguish between hypotheses. Therefore, it is essential to
gauge attained sensitivity and interpret results accordingly. We will do so by
computing a Bayes factor, using the online software provided by Dienes (2014). As
summarized by Dienes (2014), the Bayes factor represents the probability of the data
under the research hypothesis relative to the probability of the data under the null
hypotheses. We will use the conventional criteria provided by Dienes (2014) to
interpret the computed Bayes factor, with a Bayes factor equal to or greater than
three indicating significant evidence in favor of the research hypothesis (that religious
priming increases DG transfers), a Bayes factor of 1/3 or less indicating significant
evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (that religious priming does not increase DG
transfers), and a Bayes factor between 1/3 and 3 indicating insensitive data (while
recognizing that the Bayes factor provides a continuous measure, rather than a strict
cutoff point). Should we obtain a non-significant result, using the Bayes factor in this
fashion will allow us to determine if our results provide evidence in favor of the null,
or merely indicate insensitive data—a distinction not possible with null hypothesis
significance testing, even with high a priori power. This is crucial, because as we
noted in our response to van Elk Comment 1, we think the null hypothesis is likely,
and thus require a statistical analysis capable of evaluating the strength of evidence
for the null.
To compute a Bayes factor using the tools of Dienes (2014), we must specify
a plausibility distribution of effects predicted by the research hypothesis. (We define
the effect of religious priming as the difference between the average DG transfer
made by participants receiving a religious prime and the average DG game transfer
made by participants receiving a neutral prime.) Dienes (2014) offers three commonly
encountered scenarios, all of which are readily adapted to the present circumstance: a
uniform distribution for the predicted effects; a normal distribution for the predicted
effects; and a half-normal distribution for the predicted effects. With a uniform
distribution, all predicted effects between a minimum and maximum value are
assumed to be equally likely under the research hypothesis. In our case, the research
hypothesis predicts that religious priming will increase the DG transfers of sufficiently
selfish individuals, but religious priming is not expected to lead to “hyperfair” offers
(Shariff & Norenzayan, 2015, p. e105) greater than 50% of endowment. Thus, we can
model the predicted effect of the research hypothesis as a uniform distribution
ranging from 0 (no difference in DG transfers) to [1/2 endowment minus the average
DG transfer for neutrally primed participants]. The second distribution of predicted
effects suggested by Dienes is a normal distribution, with values centered on a most
likely estimate and decreasing in probability as they diverge to either side of that
point estimate. Because the research hypothesis predicts both a zero probability of an
effect size less than zero, and a zero probability of an effect size greater than the
difference between half-endowment and the average transfer of neutrally primed
participants, we will center the normal distribution upon the midway point between
zero (no difference in DG transfers) and [1/2 endowment minus the average DG
transfer for neutrally primed participants]. Following Dienes (2014), the standard
deviation of this normal distribution will be ½ the value of the midpoint, effectively
ensuring a zero probability for a predicted effect size of zero, and a zero probability
for a predicted effect resulting in a transfer of half of the participant’s endowment.
The third and final distribution of predicted effects suggested by Dienes (2014) is the
half-normal distribution, which assumes that effects near zero are more likely than
effects closer to a maximal value. We model the religious priming hypothesis using
the half-normal distribution as follows: the modal effect size of the predicted
distribution is set at zero. As predicted effect sizes increase above zero, they become
increasingly less likely, until they reach zero probability when the effect results in a
transfer of ½ the participant’s endowment—the maximal value. Following Dienes
(2014), to achieve this distribution of predicted effects, we will set the standard
deviation of this half-normal distribution equal to ½ the difference between zero (no
difference in DG game transfers) and [1/2 endowment minus the average DG transfer
for neutrally primed participants]. To ensure that our results are robust to differences
in modeling the predicted effects, we will report Bayes factors computed with each of
the three approaches detailed above, as recommended by Dienes (2014).
With our proposed sample size, are we likely to obtain Bayes factors that are
greater than 3 or less than 1/3, and thus sensitive to the issue at hand? To address
this question, we follow the recommendations of Dienes (2014) by simulating a range
of possible scenarios and calculating a Bayes factor for each. Computing a Bayes
factor requires us to stipulate sample standard error as well as sample mean
differences. To obtain reasonably realistic figures, we draw upon our previous pilot
study, in which 200 MTurk workers completed an unprimed DG game. In that study,
the mean transfer was $.241 out of a $1.00 endowment. The standard deviation was
3.006 (bearing in mind that the original scale is from 1 to 11, with each interval
corresponding to ten cents), and thus the standard error was .2126. Accounting for
the slightly smaller sample size of 195 yields an adjusted standard error of .2153.
Using these measures of variability, we calculated Bayes factors for obtained mean
differences corresponding to the following standardized effect sizes: d = -.18; d = 0; d
= .18 (the bias-corrected estimated effect of religious priming studies involving
prosociality, from the Shariff et al. (2016) meta-analysis); and d = .28 (the bias-
corrected estimated effect of religious priming studies involving only religious
participants and a measure of prosociality, from the Shariff et al. (2016) meta-
analysis). Results are displayed in the table below. The data suggest, first of all, that
results will be robust to how the predicted effects are modeled. Differences in
modeling these effects did not alter any substantive conclusions across these
simulations. Moreover, the data indicate that a sample size of 195 participants per cell
should be more than adequate to provide significant evidence for the main research
hypothesis even with an effect size of d = .18. Finally, and most critically, the sample
size should permit a wide array of non-significant results to provide positive support
for the null hypothesis. From these simulations, it appears that obtained data
equivalent to an effect size of less than .05 should provide positive evidence in favor
of the null. Of course, there is no guarantee that the variability we obtain in the final
studies will match what we obtained in the pilot; nonetheless, the results are
encouraging.

As both we and Norenzayan have noted, power for detecting an interaction
between religiosity and priming condition will be substantially lower than for
detecting a main effect. The chances of a non-significant result when we test this
hypothesized interaction will thus be greater. Thus, we will again use the Bayesian
methods of Dienes (2014) to interpret our results. We define the interaction effect as
the effect of a religious prime upon religious participants (dr) minus the effect of a
religious prime upon non-religious participants (dn). More precisely, the interaction
effect is [the average DG transfer of religious participants receiving a religious prime
minus the average DG transfer of religious participants receiving a neutral prime]
minus [the average DG transfer of non-religious participants receiving a religious
prime minus the average DG transfer of non-religious participants receiving a neutral
prime]. Interpreted conservatively, the research hypothesis predicts that the effect of
a religious prime upon religious participants will be greater than the effect of a
religious prime upon non-religious participants (dr > dn). On the research hypothesis,
the range of values for the interaction effect thus runs from 0 (when dn = dr) to dr
(when dn = 0). Following the example of Dienes (2014), we will therefore use a
uniform distribution ranging from 0 to dr to model the plausibility distribution of the
interaction effect predicted by the research hypothesis, and use the conventional
criterial recommended by Dienes (2014) to interpret the resulting Bayes factor for this
interaction. Furthermore, if the overall interaction effect is statistically significant in
the direction predicted by the research hypothesis but the simple effect of religious
priming upon non-religious participants is not significant, we will employ this
Bayesian methodology to determine if the data provide evidence that the effect of
religious priming on non-religious participants is actually zero, or merely reduced
relative to religious participants. To do so, we will model the plausibility distribution
for the simple effect of religious priming upon non-religious participants as uniform
from zero to dr. A Bayes factor below 1/3 will indicate substantial evidence in favor of
the null hypothesis that the simple effect is zero; a Bayes factor between 1/3 and 3
will indicate insensitive data; and a Bayes factor greater than 3 will indicate
substantial evidence that the simple effect is greater than zero but reduced relative to
the effect of priming upon religious participants (which was established by the
significant interaction).
Much of the above response appears on pp. 21-28. Sorry for the duplication
of text, but it seemed best to be thorough.
Primes:
3. The reading prompts are, in my opinion, problematic. I’ve always worried about
“text reading” manipulations in the literature because it’s left to the intuitions of us
the researchers as to what’s a relevant text to prime. In this case, Jesus most likely
falls under the category of a loving/benevolent God. Then the control condition is a
fable – yes, the moral of the story is not about prosociality, but a fable literally means
a story with a moral lesson. If this reading manipulation will be used, I recommend a
different, neutral reading for the control condition, and for the experimental
condition, a text that is about supernatural punishment (unless the authors have
different ideas about what in religion, if anything, encourages prosocial behavior). For
example, Yilmaz & Bahçekapili (2016, EHB) found that an explicit prime -- reading
about a punishing God increased prosocial intentions compared to benevolent God
or neutral text in a sample of Muslim Turks. I recommend something similar here
that’s appropriate for a majority-Christian sample of believers on MTurk. Another
option is to simply drop the reading prompt and just stick with the essay writing
condition as the explicit prime. (However in this case I would want to know the
content of what people wrote, as once again, supernatural punishment is the key
variable here),
We share Norenzayan’s concerns with reading primes, and indeed noted in our
original introduction that their use was inevitably problematic, albeit common in the
field. Hence, we have elected to abjure their use here and will adopt Norenzayan’s
suggestion to rely instead upon essay-based primes. With regard to Norenzayan’s
emphasis on supernatural punishment, we refer again to our responses to
Norenzayan Comments 1B and 1D.
Procedure:
4. I wonder if 15 minutes to write essays is overly optimistic. MTurkers can easily get
distracted and given the online environment, could do other things. We typically
manage to get people online to spend no more than 5 minutes writing essays.
We appreciate this feedback, and note that van Elk likewise suggested a five-minute
essay. We have adopted this suggestion, so that instructions for essay-based primes
now stipulate a five-minute writing period.
Task
5A. In Experiment 2, each player is allotted 50 cents, but the dictator receives an
additional 50 cents on top of that. So, the ‘equitable’ thing to do is still to split that
‘extra 50 cents’ allotment in half, so that each player walks away with 75 cents. If I am
understanding this right, giving people the option to take money is just a way of
driving down the total giving and thus creating more potential selfishness, which
creates appropriate conditions for the religious prime to have an effect. This is a
clever technique, as long as people actually are willing to take (some researchers have
argued that players have such an aversion to taking in these situations that they will
forego a portion of their own allotments not to take from player B e.g., Korenok et al.,
2014). The prediction here would be that if there was significant taking by religious
participants in an unprimed condition, then this should be reduced in the religious
prime condition.
Norenzayan’s understanding here is correct—we envision Study 2 as a way of
creating appropriate conditions for the religious prime to have an effect. List (2007),
from whom we have adapted the modified DG proposed in Study 2, found that with a
$5 provisional endowment, taking 90% of the other’s endowment was the median
response, taking the other’s entire endowment was the modal response, and taking
nearly half of the other participant’s endowment (-$2.48) was the mean response.
Bardsley (2005) reported comparable findings using a similar paradigm. Although
sample differences and differences due to different methods (like the stakes) are
always possible, we follow the instructions of List (2007) as closely as possible. The
results that he (and Bardsley) obtained provide sufficient justification to expect
adequate levels of taking, Korenok et al. (2014) notwithstanding.
In reviewing Appendix C in response to Norenzayan’s comments here, we noted an
omission in our instructions for Study 2. To correct this omission, the following
sentence has been inserted into Appendix C: “You have been provisionally allocated
an additional $.50. The other participant has not been allocated this additional $.50.”
With this correction, the text of Appendix C now accords with our description of the
Study 2 paradigm in the Introduction, and with Norenzayan’s understanding of the
paradigm as described above in comment 5A. Additionally, the task now allows for
transfers in $.05 rather than only in .10 increments.
5B. Another challenge will be to make sure that all the participants understand what’s
happening, and trust that the instructions are real (i.e. that they get the totals that
each player will have given the various giving options that the dictator has). I suggest
including clear instructions of the options in that study to make this clear. Something
like:
If you TAKE $0.50, then you receive $1.50 in bonus money and the other participant
will receive $0.00.
If you TAKE $0.40, then you receive $1.40 in bonus money and the other participant
will receive $0.10.
Etc.
Clear instructions are of course always desirable. Hewing closely to the previously
employed and tested methodologies of prior studies is also desirable, particularly
when a major goal is to replicate behaviors observed in the emulated studies. List
(2007) reported no indications of widespread misunderstanding of instructions, and
our verbiage is closely modeled on his. Altogether, we find it most prudent to retain
the original instructions.
Regarding the possibility that MTurk participants may not trust that the instructions
are real and that therefore they might fear not being compensated in accord with
their actual economic decisions, we note that the use of MTurk to successfully
conduct economic games is widespread. As Horton et al. (2011) observed, the success
of MTurk as a venue for economic games flows from the fact that it is an online labor
market with employee protections in place. These protections promote trust that
appropriate compensation will materialize, and include the fact that employer funds
are placed in escrow and that employers are subjected to reputational damage for
unfair worker treatment. We could cite manifold successful studies using economic
game outcomes on MTurk, but will simply mention that Horton et al. (2011) and Rand
et al. (2014)—the latter included in the Shariff et al. (2016) meta-analysis—reported
no issues with MTurk participants believing they would be compensated
appropriately for the Prisoner’s Dilemma game they played after priming. More
recently, Everett, Haque, & Rand (2016) successfully used two resource allocation
Games on MTurk to investigate religious prosociality, with player compensation tied
to allocation decisions. And, finally, results from our recent pilot study gave us no
reason to believe that participants were concerned that they might not receive
compensation due them from their DG decisions. Altogether, we see little basis for
concern in this regard.
So there are three concerns: (a) whether players will believe what’s happening, (b)
potential confusion about the rules of the game (c) if there is aversion to take from
player B, than there might not be enough baseline selfishness. It’s good to assess
believability and comprehension to address two of these issues.
Please see responses to comments 5A and 5B above.
Payment plan:
6. I didn’t quite understand how the payment plan works . Participants get a base
payment, plus a bonus, plus an opportunity to win more money in the DG task?
That is correct. The payment structure is more complicated than we would prefer, but
is necessary in order to minimize fees paid to Amazon. Minimizing fees is essential in
order to run as many subjects as possible.
My name is misspelled in the Acknowledgements section, although I appreciated the
gesture! Ouch. My sincerest apologies for the typo, and thank you for the detailed
comments.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Professor Chris Chambers):
Comments to the Author:
The Stage 2 manuscript was returned to one of the original reviewers from
Stage 1 (the other reviewer was unavailable). The comments of the
reviewer are below, and I have also re-read the manuscript the myself.
The reviewer makes three categories of recommendation.
First - the reviewers offers some useful suggestions for additional
exploratory analyses, including an additional robustness check on the
religiosity classification, and an analysis specifically in participants who
demonstrated explicit awareness. I think there is merit in these
suggestions; however please note that the Stage 2 RR policy does not
require authors to conduct additional exploratory analyses unless they are
necessary to support the conclusions. In this case, I judge that these
analyses are not necessary to justify the claims in the paper, however I do
think they would strengthen the article so I would recommend giving them
careful consideration.
Second - the reviewer raises the question of whether correction for
multiple comparisons should be applied. Where this applies to
preregistered tests and deviates from the approved protocol, they should
not be applied retrospectively, however an additional exploratory analysis
(or footnote) could be included to report the robustness of the outcomes
under different assumed levels of Type I error correction. Again, I will
leave you to judge the appropriateness of this course of action.
Finally - and most importantly in my view, the reviewer suggests that the
key messages in the results might be surfaced more prominently. I think
this is an excellent suggestion, and I will leave it to you to decide how to
respond, but one approach would be to include an overview of the key
outcomes at the very start of the Results section, e.g. a section called
"Overview of Key Findings" section or something similar, following the
reviewer's suggestion of highlighting those findings and pointing to the
specific sections of the Results containing the details, followed by the
current presentation of outcomes.
Provided these comments are addressed thoroughly in the revised
manuscript and/or response, final Stage 2 acceptance should be
forthcoming without requiring futher in-depth review.
Thanks to the Associate Editor for these comments. We address them in
detail below, in response to the Reviewer 2’s comments.
Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
Review Implicit and Explicit Influences of Religious Cognition on Dictator
Game Transfers
I was pleased to see how this work progressed and the care and effort the
authors took in analyzing the data, and finishing the manuscript. The main
conclusions are clear and appear warranted in light of the data presented.
I only have a few requests and recommendations.
The classification of participants as religious or non-religious was based on
an assignment to either group according to their score on a belief in god
scale. Although this makes sense, it would be interesting to know to what
extent the results (i.e., most notably the effect of explicit religious priming
for religious participants) hinges on this classification. Maybe the authors
could conduct a ‘robustness analysis’ (i.e., using different classification
criteria) to determine the potential boundary conditions of the effects they
reported?
We agree that the question of how best to operationalize religiosity is an
important one, and that the issue of possible boundary conditions related
to religiosity is interesting. However, we have some misgivings about
conducting the additional analyses that Reviewer 2 recommends.
First, a methodological point. Our classification scheme—which follows
Shariff & Norenzayan’s (2007) approach—uses a belief scale in conjunction
with participants’ self-reports of religious orientation. Non-religious
individuals are those who identify as atheist or agnostic AND who score
below the midpoint of the belief scale. To explore possible boundary
conditions further, it might be interesting to use the belief scale in
isolation. Using this continuous scale in a regression model, however,
would preclude us from employing Dienes’s approach for analyzing null
results—Dienes’s methods, after all, are are based upon mean differences
between-group comparisons rather than continuous variables.
Other ways of treating religiosity are certainly possible, but the
prospect of a lot of post hoc exploration of boundary conditions frankly
makes us a bit uncomfortable. We undertook these experiments with
some skepticism toward the possibility that there would be any reliable
priming effects at all, and our preregistered strategy has now uncovered
some evidence for a small effect of explicit priming despite our initial
skepticism. If we were now to undertake a series of post hoc analyses to
locate conditions under which this effect vanishes, those actions would
likely reflect poorly upon our scientific good faith while doing rather little
to change any minds about the relationship between religion and prosocial
behavior. For this reason, we think it best for us to adhere to the
preregistered analytic strategy. We played by the rules of pre-registration
and we think we should now live with the results. We do note in the
manuscript, however, that the data are publicly available, so that any
researcher who wishes to investigate boundary conditions of the reported
effects can do so.
Overall, the authors conducted a large number of statistical tests. I
wondered whether some correction for multiple comparisons should be
applied, i.e., by correcting the BF or the p-values. This seems especially
important given the fact that one of the main conclusions (i.e., effect of
explicit religious priming for religious participants) hinges on not very
convincing BFs and rather small effect sizes.
We thank the reviewer for this comment. The issue of correcting p-values
for multiple comparisons is certainly an important one, and for that reason
probably best addressed at the preregistration stage. Our preregistration
stipulated one-tailed significance tests and no correction for multiple
comparisons, and we would be uncomfortable making adjustments after
the fact. Among other things, it would not be clear which adjustment to
make. We note, however, that our analyses also provide Bayes Factors,
and conclusions from Bayesian analyses do not depend upon the number
of tests that the researcher conducts.
Overall, though we are opposed to post hoc adjustments, we find the
reviewer’s point about the weakness of the evidence for an explicit
priming effect among religious individuals to be well-taken. We think that
the best approach here is to supplement the text of the General
Discussion so as to highlight the (weak) Bayes Factors for each
experiment, and to note that reported p-values do not reflect any
adjustment for multiple comparisons.
Accordingly, we have modified p. 55 so that the first paragraph in the
“Implicit vs. Explicit Religious Priming” section now includes the following
insertion:
“(Indeed, considering each experiment separately, there is little
evidence to suggest that explicit religious priming increases Dictator Game
transfers among religious subjects. In both experiments, p-values were
slightly larger than 0.100 in a one-tailed test, even without correcting for
multiple comparisons. And Bayes factors, which need no correction for
multiple comparisons, at best favored the priming hypothesis only
slightly—by 1.46 to 1 in Experiment 1 and 1.26 to 1 in Experiment 2.)”
The authors did not proceed with an analysis, excluding participants who
showed awareness of the aim of the study based on the suspicion probe.
The argument for not conducting this analysis is that the main hypotheses
were not confirmed. Still, it might be interesting to know to what extent a
similar (absence of an) effect is observed while excluding participants who
correctly guessed the hypothesis. This seems especially relevant in light of
a recent replication report on the Dijksterhuis et al., professor priming
study
(http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691618755704), in
which it was found that implicit priming might exert a small effect (on
correct answers on Trivia questions) – only for participants who were not
aware of the aim of the study.
There appears to be a bit of confusion here regarding whom we did and
did not exclude from the analyses, and how these exclusions relate to the
proposed tests of Prediction 3. The reviewer’s comment suggests that we
did not exclude participants “who showed awareness of the aim of the
study based on the suspicion probe.” In fact, we did. In accordance with
the preregistered exclusion criteria, we excluded participants whose
responses to the 1st, 2nd, or 5th items of the suspicion probe indicated a
suspicion that the study had to do with a connection between religion and
prosociality. Therefore, we have already addressed the main concern of
the reviewer here: our results support the view that implicit religious
priming does not increase Dictator Game transfers among participants
who were not aware of the aim of the study. We also conducted analyses
with the full sample—which we note in the main text, and direct readers to
Supplemental Information for details. Results using the entire sample
indicate that the conclusion is unchanged: implicit religious priming did
not increase DG transfers even when we analysed the full sample.
What we did not do was remove from the analysed sample those
participants who reported “conscious awareness of religious words”—a
phrase which reflects the wording of Prediction 3. This exclusion would
have been done based on Items 6-9 of the suspicion probe.
In general, there is a subtle distinction to be made between
participants who were consciously aware of religious words, and
participants who guessed the aim of the study. The reviewer emphasizes
the latter—that is, the possibility that implicit priming effects depend upon
participant knowledge of the experiment’s aim. That is an interesting
question but one that goes beyond the scope of our study, which was
focused on conscious awareness of religious words and the possibility that
the effects of putatively “implicit” religious priming on prosociality were in
fact more akin to explicit priming effects. Because we observed no implicit
religious priming effects—either among the entire sample or among the
sample of participants who did not guess the nature of the study—it
makes little sense to us to test whether the “effect” of implicit religious
priming is robust to the removal of participants who reported conscious
awareness of religious words. We therefore prefer to adhere to the
preregistration plan in this regard, which in the Data Analyses section
stipulated that Prediction 3 would be tested only if Predictions 1B or 2B
were supported.
In an attempt to be a bit clearer about the fact that we excluded
participants for hypothesis guessing, we altered p. 15 slightly so that it
now reads: “Subjects were excluded in accordance with pre-registered
criteria: we excluded participants whose responses to the suspicion probe
indicated suspicion that the study had to do with a link between religion
and prosociality. We also excluded participants who demonstrated
insufficient attention to the task.” In addition, we altered p. 51 of the
General Discussion so that it now reads: “For both experiments, these
analyses substantially favored the hypothesis that implicit religious
priming has no effect on Dictator Game transfers. This conclusion held
when we analysed the data without excluding any participants.”
I think the conclusion about a main effect of religiosity on prosocial
behavior (i.e., amount of money transferred) deserves more attention and
could be mentioned in the abstract and in the general discussion. This
finding is important given the discussion to what extent the relation
between religiosity and prosociality is mainly limited to self-report
measures, or extends to actual behavioral measures of prosociality as
well.
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. To the Abstract, we have
added the following sentence: “Results indicated that in both experiments
religious subjects transferred more money on average than did non-
religious subjects.” To each Results section, we have added a subsection
header intended to highlight these findings: “Did religious subjects
transfer more money than did non-religious subjects?” And to the General
Discussion we have added a subsection header entitled “An effect of
religiosity” and added the following new text to that subsection: “We note
as well that in both experiments religious individuals transferred more
money on average than did non-religious individuals—8.6 cents more in
Experiment 1, and 7.0 cents more in Experiment 2. This effect of
religiosity emerged regardless of priming condition and appears to add to
the body of behavioral research suggesting a positive association of
religiosity with prosociality [1, 2]. It is interesting that a persistent effect
of religiosity emerged even though the anonymous recipients of these
transfers had no previous relationships with the subjects and were unable
to convey any information about whether they actually had a need for
some of the dictator’s money. Since closeness and need are two of the
two major social-psychological cues influencing people’s regard for others’
welfare, it is not entirely clear that religious people’s larger transfers in the
two experiments reported here reflect a heightened regard for the welfare
of strangers per se among religious people. Some researchers have
suggested instead that Dictator Game transfers may largely reflect a
desire to avoid negative social evaluation (52-54), which raises the
possibility that results such as those we obtained here reflect instead a
heightened tendency for religious people to share with others out of a
heightened aversion to negative social evaluation for seeming stingy.”
After doing that, we also elected to add a subsection header to the final
paragraph of the General Discussion: “Supernatural Punishment.”

Overall I found the manuscript quite lengthy and at some points too
extensive / too detailed. For me it would be helpful if the manuscript could
somehow highlight the most relevant analyses and results, while still
including the necessary additional information. I appreciate the authors’
efforts in providing a very accurate and representative account of their
preregistered study, but the manuscript could definitely be improved on
getting the message across. In my view the most essential findings are
(1) religious participants donate more money, (2) implicit priming does
not increase prosocial behavior among religious and non-religious
participants, (3) a new meta-analysis does indicate that there is no effect
of implicit religious priming on prosocial behavior, (4) explicit religious
priming might increase prosocial behavior for religious participants,
although the effect is small and the underlying mechanism remains to be
elucidated (but it is probably not belief in supernatural punishment that is
driving the effect). Maybe one idea would be to point readers more
directly to where they can find the relevant information to support each of
these claims, because it took me quite some time to figure out which part
of the results section supported each of these claims.
We appreciate this feedback from the reviewer and note that it was
seconded by the Editor. We certainly don’t want our key findings to be
obscured by an overly detailed write-up. We have therefore gladly taken
advantage of the invitation to provide a section called "Overview of Key
Findings," which now appears shortly before the presentation of
Experiment 1. The new text is below:
“Overview of Key Findings
To help readers navigate our rather extensive results, below we
provide a brief summary of essential findings from the
experiments, and we direct readers to the locations of the relevant
supporting evidence.
The key findings are as follows:
1) Religious participants transferred more money in the
Dictator Games than did non-religious participants. (For
support, see the subsections entitled “Did religious subjects
transfer more money than did non-religious subjects?” in
the Results section of both Experiment 1 and Experiment
2.)
2) Implicit religious priming did not increase Dictator Game
transfers among either religious or non-religious
participants. (For support, see the subsections entitled
“Prediction 2B” in the Results section of both Experiment
1 and Experiment 2.)
3) A new meta-analysis of all available studies reinforces the
conclusion that implicit religious priming does not
increase Dictator Game transfers. (For support, see the
Study 3 Results section).
4) Explicit religious priming did not appear to increase
Dictator Game transfers among non-religious participants,
but may have increased transfers among religious
participants, with a small effect size. (For support, see the
subsections entitled “Prediction 2C” in the Results section
of both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, as well as the
subsection of the General Discussion entitled “Implicit vs.
Explicit Religious Priming.”)”
Minor
‘at present’ => please qualify at present, because at the time the paper
may come out, some time will have passed.
Thanks for catching this. The text now reads “as of July 2018.”

Abstract: Does religion promote prosocial behaviour? Despite numerous
publications that seem to answer this question affirmatively, divergent
results from recent meta-analyses and pre-registered replication efforts
suggest the issue is not yet settled. Additional uncertainty lingers around
whether (a) the effects of religious cognition on prosocial behaviour obtain
through implicit cognitive processes, explicit cognitive processes, or both;
and (b) whether religious cognition increases generosity only among
people disinclined to share with anonymous strangers. Here we report two
experiments designed to address these concerns. In Experiment 1 we
sought to replicate Shariff and Norenzayan’s demonstration of the effects
of implicit religious priming on Dictator Game offers to anonymous
strangers; unlike Shariff and Norenzayan, however, we used an online
environment where anonymity was virtually assured. In Experiment 2, we
introduced a “taking” option to allow greater expression of baseline
selfishness. In both experiments, we sought to activate religious cognition
implicitly and explicitly, and we investigated the possibility that religious
priming depends upon the extent to which subjects view God as a
punishing, authoritarian figure. Bayesian statistical methods supported the
null hypothesis that implicit religious priming did not increase Dictator
Game transfers in either experiment, even among religious subjects.
Collectively, the two experiments furnished support for a small but reliable
effect of explicit priming, though among religious subjects only. Neither
experiment offered strong evidence to support the hypothesis that the
effect of religious priming depends upon viewing God as a punishing
figure. Finally, in a random-effects meta-analysis of relevant studies, we
found that the overall effect of implicit religious priming on Dictator Game
transfers was small and did not statistically differ from zero.
