This paper reported the in-situ polymerization and hydrothermal preparation and
characterization of MWCNTs/PANI/MoS2 ternary nanocomposites. After careful evaluation of
the manuscript, I find this paper would not be suitable for publication in Royal Society Open
Science in its present state. The main reason for this decision is the ambiguity given by the quality
of writing and data evaluationas shown in the following paragraph.
1. The novel construction for PANI-based electrode materials is insufficient advance.
2. The specific capacitance evaluated galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) of the obtained
MWCNTs/PANI/MoS2 hybrid is 542.56 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 is general.
3. In Figure 5b, there is a big error in marking current density.
4. In Figure 5c, rate capability of MoS2/PANI composites should be tested in order to confirm the
contribution of carbon nanotubes networks.
5. In Figure 5d, the cycling stability (74.25% capacitance retention) over 2000 cycles is poor and
the number of testing cycles is too few.
6. In Figure 2d, TEM image of the ternary hybrid of MWCNTs/PANI/MoS2 nanocomposites
showed some regular nanoparticles, please explain and prove it.
7. There are too many grammar, spelling, and format errors in the manuscript.

Appendix A
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our
manuscript entitled “Novel ternary nanocomposites of
MWCNTs/PANI/MoS2: preparation, characterization and enhanced
electrochemical capacitance”. (Manuscript ID: RSOS-171365). Those
comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our
paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our research. We
have studied comments carefully and have made correction which we
hope meet with your approval. Revised portions are marked in yellow in
the paper. The main corrections in the paper and the responses to the
reviewer’s comments are as following:
Response to Reviewer 1:
Comments 1: Authors should compare the results with those in the
literature in a short table.
Response: Thanks for your great suggestion. According to the advice, we
have compared the performance with different electrode materials of
supercapacitors in the manuscript (Table 1).
Table 1. Comparison of properties of different electrode materials

MoS2/PANI 390 F g at 0.8 A g 86% after 1000 cycles at 0.8 A g [29]

MWCNTs/PANI/MoS2 542.6 F g at 0.5 A g 73.7% after 3000 cycles at 1 A g This work
The recent researches on the electrochemical performance involving
these materials [3, 18, 29-34] are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the
specific capacitance of MoS2/PANI [29] and PANI/sMWCNTs [18] is not
high and the cycling stability of CNTs-g-PANI [30] and
graphene/polyaniline nanotube [34] is not ideal.
Response to Reviewer 2:
Comments 1: The novel construction for PANI-based electrode materials
is insufficient advance.
Response: Thanks for your great suggestion. Considering the Reviewer’s
suggestion, we re-searched and studied the literature based on
polyaniline as electrode material. There are a lot of reports based on
polyaniline as electrode material recently, for example, M. Manoj et al (M.
Manoj et al., 2017 Polyaniline–Graphene Oxide based ordered
nanocomposite electrodes for high-performance supercapacitor
applications. J Mater Sci: Mater Electron.
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10854-017-7292-9), attempted to assess the
suitability of Polyaniline (PANI)–Graphene Oxide (GO) composite material,
which was obtained using the simple in-situ oxidative polymerization
technique, for developing supercapacitors with good performance
characteristics. Fuwei Liu et al (Fuwei Liu et al., 2017 Facile Processing of
Free-Standing Polyaniline/SWCNT Film as an Integrated Electrode for
Flexible Supercapacitor Application. ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.
http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.7b08382), reported that
the integrated electrode of free-standing polyaniline (PANI)/single-wall
carbon nanotube (SWCNT) film with high performance has been
developed via a facile solution deposition method, which could be
employed as current collector and active material in the meantime. D Liu
et al (D Liu et al., 2017 Independently double-crosslinked carbon
nanotubes/polyaniline composite films as flexible and robust free-
standing electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors. CARBON.
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2017.06.097), found that C-CNTs / PANI
composite films had desirable mechanical strength. These specific
double-crosslinked carbon nanotubes / polyaniline (C-CNTs / TC-PANI)
composite films were obtained by thermal crosslinking (TC) the PANI
coatings in the C-CNTs / PANI films, with the density increasing to 531 F /
g and 455 F / g. Sajid Ali Ansari et al (Sajid Ali Ansari et al., 2017
Mechanically exfoliated MoS2 sheet coupled with conductive polyaniline
as a superior supercapacitor electrode material. Journal of Colloid and
Interface Science. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.05.064)
constructed a nanocomposite by combining a mechanically exfoliated
MoS2 (M-MoS2) sheet with polyaniline (PANI) using a simple and scalable
in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization method. The enhanced
electrochemical supercapacitive performance was correlated to the
synergistic effect and chemical interactions between the PANI and MoS2.
Hui Xu et al (Hui Xu et al., 2017 Zn2+-Doped Polyaniline/Graphene Oxide
as Electrode Material for Electrochemical Supercapacitors. Journal of
ELECTRONIC MATERIALS. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11664-017-5638-y),
found that the Zn2+/PANI/GO composites could be applied as high-
performance supercapacitor electrodes. Flexible supercapacitors (SCs)
with compact configuration were ideal energy storage devices for
portable electronics, owing to their original advantages (e.g., fast
charging/discharging).
We have searched and studied the recent research directions of these
scholars. It can be seen that the composite study of polyaniline as one
kind of the electrode materials is still a hot spot. However, we did not find
ternary nanocomposites of MWCNTs/PANI/MoS2 as an electrode
reported. Therefore, our research has a certain advance.
Comments 2: The specific capacitance evaluated galvanostatic charge-
discharge (GCD) of the obtained MWCNTs/PANI/MoS2 hybrid is 542.56 F
g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 is general.
Response: Thanks for your detailed advice. The Reviewer’s evaluation is
reasonable for that the specific capacitance of the obtained
MWCNTs/PANI/MoS2 hybrid is 542.56 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-
1
is general. However, it is larger than those of MoS2 electrode (128.75 F
g-1), pure PANI electrode (438.46 F g-1), and MWCNTs/PANI electrode
(480.8 F g-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g-1. This can be due to that the
nanoflower-like MoS2 grown on the surface of MWCNTs/PANI produces
large double-layer capacitance and this kind of nanostructure does not
obstruct the transmission of proton and electron between PANI surface
and H2SO4 electrolyte, which can maintain the faradaic
pseudocapacitance property of PANI. However, in this work, our
exploration of MWCNTs/PANI/MoS2 composites is limited, and other
researchers may be able to improve the program in the future research,
and get a larger specific capacitance.
Comments 3: In Figure 5b, there is a big error in marking current density.
Response: Thanks for your detailed advice. It is our lack of rigour that
leads to this big error, and we have corrected it. The corrected figure is
shown below.
Figure 5b. GCD plots of MPM-0.1 at different current densities.
Comments 4: In Figure 5c, rate capability of MoS2/PANI composites
should be tested in order to confirm the contribution of carbon nanotubes
networks.
Response: Thanks for your kind suggestion. Considering the Reviewer’s
suggestion, the rate capability of MoS2/PANI composites has been tested.
Comparing the rate performance of the MoS2/PANI and MPM-0.1 in
Figure 5c, it demonstrated that the existence of MWCNTs could improve
the stability of the electrode materials and consequently enhance the
discharge performance of supercapacitor.
Figure 5c. variation of the specific capacitance with different current density for
MoS2, PANI, MoS2/PANI, MWCNTs/PANI and MPM-0.1 nanocomposites.
Comments 5: In Figure 5d, the cycling stability (74.25% capacitance
retention) over 2000 cycles is poor and the number of testing cycles is too
few.
Response: Thanks for your kind suggestion. Considering the Reviewer’s
suggestion, we have increased the number of testing cycles. The
capacitance retention is 73.71% over 3000 cycles (figure.S3). Compared
with the capacitance retention over 2000 cycles (figure 5d), the
capacitance retention tends to be stable. Since we applied the electrode
material slurry on the electrode for testing, there was a possibility that
during the test, the active material would fall off, causing the specific
capacitance to decrease.

1 for 2000 cycles.
Comments 6: In Figure 2d, TEM image of the ternary hybrid of
MWCNTs/PANI/MoS2 nanocomposites showed some regular
nanoparticles, please explain and prove it.
Response: Thanks for your kind suggestion. According to the advice, we
have already shown the structure of MWCNTs, PANI and MoS2 in figure
2d, and from the amplification in the lower right corner we can see that
the long strip is MWCNTs, the outside of the MWCNTs is PANI, and the
nanoflower-like (as can be seen from figure 2b) structure grown on the
surface of the PANI is MoS2.

Comments 7: There are too many grammar, spelling, and format errors in
the manuscript.
Response: Thanks for your kind and precise suggestion. According to the
advice, we have carefully checked the grammar, spelling and format. Also,
the manuscript has been modified by professionals.
Thank you very much for your time and your valuable suggestion. We
sincerely hope this manuscript could be acceptable to be published on
label_version_2
RSOS. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
Best regards.
