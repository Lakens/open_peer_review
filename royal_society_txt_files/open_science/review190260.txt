Comments to the Author(s)
This is an acceptable paper for publication in Royal Society Open Science. The manuscript
entitled "Functional Differences of BaPDS1 and BaPDS2 Genes in Chinese Kale" is an interesting
and nice work. The manuscript reported the differences of promoter cis-elements, expression
patterns, and subcellular localization between the two genes. The results also well explained the
functional differences via CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. This work will provide a reference for the
functional research between various members of a gene family.
However, some comments should be made to improve the manuscript. Below are some questions
and/or suggestions.
1) M&M
Does the light intensity mean the light source itself? If yes, how much is it at the surface of plant
leaves? How much did you spray for each phytohormes?
2) Fig 1
According to your analysis, there are MeJA and ABA response cis-element in the promoter of
PDS1. However, PDS2 shows stronger response to the MeJA treatment. Could you discuss the
possible cause?
3) Fig 2A
The 3rd image should be the merge of red and green. However, the red channel can hardly be
seen. Could you check the parameter?
4) Fig 4
The authors showed the DNA sequence of the edited plants. However, further analysis, such as
the effect of nucleotide sequence change on the translation or protein sequence should be done.

This paper shows a single, presumably loss of function gene edited line for each of two phytoene
desaturase homologs as well as a double mutant in Chinese kale. The authors characterize the
response of these genes to various light qualities, intensities as well as plant hormones and relate
these to cis element in each of the two promoter sequences. Overall the quality of the manuscript
could have been better as evidenced by the large number of recommended edits. In addition, the
paper would have been stronger if the phenotypes of multiple independent single and double
mutant lines were assessed. The partial redundancy of these genes, characterization of cis
elements in promoters for these genes combined with gene expression under various light and
hormonal treatments makes for an interesting story.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Stephen Long):
This is a sound piece of science, that adds interesting information on independent roles, both
essential, for two gene family members. Reviewer #1 raises key issues that must be addressed
through corrections/additions to the ms. The ms is poorly written at many points and that has to
be addressed if the ms is to become finally acceptable for publication. Reviewer #2 has noted
many points in the English that need revision/correction. It is essential that all are attended to,
and the final version is reviewed with a native English speaker before final submission. The final
submission must be accompanied by a letter, explaining how each point in the reviewers' reports
are addressed.

Title: Functional Differences of BaPDS1 and BaPDS2 Genes in Chinese Kale
Royal Society Open Science
Dear Professor Catrin Pritchard
We are pleased to submit a revised version of the manuscript RSOS-190260. We are
truly grateful to editor and reviewers’ critical comments and thoughtful suggestions.
We have worked through the details in the comments of the reviewers, and revised the
paper accordingly. We hope the new manuscript will meet the standard of Royal
Society Open Science. Below you will find our point-by-point responses to the
reviewers’ comments/questions.
Thank you very much for your consideration.
Yours sincerely,
Hao-Ru Tang
Editor' Comments to Author:
1) Reviewer #1 raises key issues that must be addressed through corrections/additions
to the ms. The ms is poorly written at many points and that has to be addressed if the
ms is to become finally acceptable for publication.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have made corresponding revises according to
the opinions of reviewer 1.
1) Reviewer #2 has noted many points in the English that need revision/correction.
It is essential that all are attended to, and the final version is reviewed with a native
English speaker before final submission.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised point by point according to the
opinions in the document of reviewer 2. We also have carefully checked and
revised the manuscript to improve the English expression by ourselves, and then
the manuscript was also critically read by Dr. Yunting Zhang (University of
California, Davis).
Referees' Comments to Author:
Referee: 1
1) M&M
Does the light intensity mean the light source itself? If yes, how much is it at the
surface of plant leaves? How much did you spray for each phytohormes?
It is a very good suggestion. The light intensity means the light source itself. The
light source is directly above the plant, and the linear distance from light to the
plants is about 15 cm. We have stopped spraying until the leaf surface was
dripping, and the amount was about 2 mL of each phytohormones per plant. We
have revised them in the manuscript.
2) Fig 1
According to your analysis, there are MeJA and ABA response cis-element in the
promoter of PDS1. However, PDS2 shows stronger response to the MeJA treatment.
Could you discuss the possible cause?
Thanks for your suggestion. The results of gene expressions under ABA and
MeJA treatments differed from the predicted results. This may be caused by the
missing potential cis-acting elements located in the distal promoter region, or the
inter-species differences between Chinese kale and the reference species in the
database, while additional research results of cis-acting elements and advances in
bioinformatics will accelerate the resolution of this problem in the future.
3) Fig 2A
The 3rd image should be the merge of red and green. However, the red channel can
hardly be seen. Could you check the parameter?
It is a very good suggestion. We have adjusted the parameter of Figure 2A, and
revised it in the manuscript.
4) Fig 4
The authors showed the DNA sequence of the edited plants. However, further analysis,
such as the effect of nucleotide sequence change on the translation or protein
sequence should be done.
It is a very good suggestion. We have analyzed the effect of nucleotide changes on
translation and protein, and added the results in Figure 4 and the manuscript.
Referee: 2
1) Overall the quality of the manuscript could have been better as evidenced by the
large number of recommended edits.
Thanks for your suggestion. We have revised point by point according to the
opinions in your document. We also have carefully checked and revised the
manuscript to improve the English expression by ourselves, and then the
manuscript was also critically read by Dr. Yunting Zhang (University of
California, Davis).

Nusinow DA, Bart R, Taylor NJ. 2017 Efficient CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of
phytoene desaturase in cassava. Frontiers in Plant Science 18, 1780.
It is a very good suggestion. This is a very good article enlightening to our
experiment, and we have quoted this article in our manuscript.
3) p3 line 37 – What is meant by an artificial intelligence incubator?
Thanks for your suggestion. Actually, the artificial intelligence incubator is an
artificial climate chamber that can control the conditions of temperature,
humidity and light. We have revised it in the manuscript.
4) In addition, the paper would have been stronger if the phenotypes of multiple
independent single and double mutant lines were assessed.
It is a very good suggestion. As suggested, we will obtain more single and double
mutant plant lines in later experiments to confirm our results.
