My comments are:
Introduction 2nd paragraph: Hafnium alkoxide is mainly used in ALD [10]. This not true and the
ref. 10 does not say that. Ref. 10 tells about the density of the films. A better reference what
precursors have been used in ALD (and also in case of Hf ) is J. Appl. Phys. 113 (2013) 021301.
The reference 11 is also bad if a general reference is wanted to show the importance of HfO2 as
high-k material. There are more than 5 000 papers on this topic in the literature and best is to refer
to a review. A good example could be Mater. Sci. Reports 72 (2011) 97. Just to your information,
in industrial scale ALD HfOx are made for transistors from HfCl4.
Same paragraph: … vapor pressure is a crucial parameter for selecting precursors for ALD. Yes,
volatility is the most important property. However, for practical use of precursors we need the
3
knowledge at which temperature we can reach about 0.1 mbar pressure. Pressure is not a critical
parameter in an ideal ALD process – the only thing is that we have enough precursor molecules
to saturate the surface. Having said that it does not mean that knowing the vapor pressure
behavior is not important but it can be more important outside ALD.
The experimental part is OK. The measurements are made carefully and the knowledge on
isopropoxide is useful. It is also useful to see that the other alkoxides decompose.
Some formal comments:
Tables 5 and 9 are very short. Is it necessary to present the numbers in a table.
Numbers in Tables 6 and 7 are almost constant. Are the tables needed?
Text for Table 3 is very short and not understandable in present form.

label_comment_3
This manuscript by Chen et al described the synthesis, characterization of two Hf alkoxides, and
evaluated their potential in atomic layer deposition applications. The results and discussions are
well organized. The manuscript is well written. However, due to the following reasons, major
revision is recommended:
1. The authors claimed that they synthesized the Hf(OR)4 compounds: ‘the purity of hafnium
alkoxides purified by reduced pressure distillation can be up to 99.997%.’ It seems they did the
calculation based on trace metal impurity. However, they didn’t count organic impurities. If one
checks the NMR spectra carefully (Figures 2a and 2b), there are obvious impure peaks that are
adjacent to each product peak. This reviewer suspects there is unreacted alcohol. Did the authors
do Elemental Analysis to compare with calculated C/H amounts? The authors likely used regular
4
CDCl3 as deuterated solvent instead of anhydrous CDCl3. If the authors obtained high purity
product, the impurity such as trace water may lead to decomposition and thus impurity peaks.
The purity can’t be so high as 99.997% if considering the impurities by NMR.
2. The authors mentioned previous work by Yang et al. on Hf tetrabutoxide. Please compare the
results with Yang’s and comment.
3. Figure 2a: the integrals are not correct and should be 4H and 24H.
4. Figure 2b: the integrals are not correct and should be 8H, 8H and 12H.

label_comment_5
In the work of Changhong Wang et al., in order to identify a volatile metallo-organic precursor
for the deposition of HfO2 films for atomic layer deposition (ALD) applications, the evaporative
properties of three hafnium alkoxides were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).
Hafnium isopropoxide, hafnium n-propoxide and hafnium n-butoxide were synthesized by
electrochemical method and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis techniques.
Synthesized samples were subjected to a simultaneous thermogravimetric–differential thermal
analysis (TG–DTA) unit at 10 K min-1 in a dry nitrogen atmosphere flowing at 100 mL min-1.
And then, a modified Langmuir equation was used to calculate vapor pressure curves for
hafnium isopropoxide and hafnium n-propoxide. The vapor pressure curve of hafnium
isopropoxide was calculated to be lnp=31.157(±0.200)-13130.57(±56.50)/T. However, no curve
was constructed for hafnium n-propoxide and hafnium n-butoxide because these two
compounds undergo evaporation and deposition simultaneously.
The manuscript is mostly well written, the method seems to be appropriate and properly
conducted. However, explanations of the experimental procedures and results are not sufficient.
Some more explanations need to be added to make the study more comprehensible. In addition,
8
the authors need some improvements to English, many sentences are absolutely not clear (see
details below). The presentation of this work can be improved and have listed my suggestions
below. At this stage, my recommendation for this manuscript is major revision.
Specific Comments:
1. Page 20, “Thermal property is of prime consideration……predict the desired conditions and is
favorable for process investigation.” This sentence is too complicated and not clear.
2. Page 21, 3.2 characterization, the scan times and resolution of the FTIR measurements should
be given.
3. Page 21, “Then, the distillation temperature was raised to corresponding temperature to
remove a little amount of ester.” What does the “corresponding temperature” mean? This
sentence is not clear.
4. Page 21, “And then the impurity content of hafnium oxide was converted into that of hafnium
alkoxides.” I’m wondering where does the hafnium oxide comes from. More explanations should
be added here.
5. In the whole text, both “<U+2103>” and “K” were used for temperature, which should be revised to
maintain consistency.
6. Page 21, “the direct electrochemical synthesis of hafnium alkoxides compared with the
traditional method has a greater promise owing to its remarkable advantages.” “compared with
the traditional method” can be deleted.
7. Page 21, “Detailed reasons were described previously in our study.” “study” should be
“studies”.
8. Page 21, “hafnium alkoxides was successfully obtained by Turevskaya et al”. “et al” should be
“et al.”
9. Page 21, TGA, FT-IR, 1H-NMR and ICP appeared in the main body for the first time without
full name.
10. Page 22, “Peaks at around 2970 cm-1 and 2860 cm-1 correspond to asymmetric and symmetric
stretch vibrations, respectively.” Which functional group does these two peaks belong to?
11. Page 23, “Corresponding datum, which have been used to construct Figure 4, to calculate k
are given in table 3, in which the values of pcalc. are obtained from the fitting line of plot of p
against v.” This sentence doesn't read smoothly.

I have checked the revised manuscript carefully. Further discussion about the removal of
impurities contents of hafnium alkoxides were added. In addition, more explanations were given
which made the manuscript complete and comprehensible. However, it seems that the authors
have only revised the manuscript according to part of the suggestions I have raised.
1. Although I have raised that some sentences in the manuscript are too complicated and not

2. Once again, the scan times of the FTIR measurements should be given for clear presentation.
After the modification made by the authors, the revised manuscript is much better than the

Appendix A
The vapor pressure and vaporization enthalpy for metal-organic compounds is an indispensable part of
application of such systems in CVD or ALD processes. At the same time the incorrect data or incorrectly
assessed values can bring too many troubles for elimination of the substances for CVD or ALD. Thus the
experimental values determined in the current study of rather high importance but should be
significantly improved in the field of assessment of the studied process and uncertainty of the final
values. The following issues should be resolved before the article can be published.
1. Abstract: What are “the evaporative properties”?
2. Abstract: Synthesized samples were subject to a simultaneous TGA in a nitrogen atmosphere at
10 <U+25E6>C min-1 at 100 mL min-1.
This sentence is not clear. What do authors mean under simultaneous TGA? And does it mean
“were subject to TGA”?
3. Introduction:
“In early years, TG is used in an isothermal condition, but recently an elevated temperature
program is used, which makes the obtainment of data faster and reduces the number of
samples required [7, 8]” Thermogravimetry from the very beginning was used in scanning
regime at elevated temperatures? The idea of this sentence is absolutely not clear or poor.
4. Introduction: “this HfO2 layers” change for “these HfO2 layers”
5. Introduction: “Vapor pressure curves can be found using the Antoine equation.” Antoine
equation is only the fitting equation for vapor pressure and can’t serve as the origin of vapor
pressure data for compounds.
6. Table 1: please state the origin of provided data (certificate or method of determination)
7. 2.1. Materials and sample preparation:
“Electrochemical synthesis of the hafnium alkoxides was carried out under the basic
experimental conditions: anhydrous alcohol 2.2 L, conductive agent Et4NBr 0.04 M, required
solution temperature (boiling temperature), polar distance 2 cm and applied current 2A (current
density 100 A m-2 ).”
Why authors call that the basic conditions? At what temperature the synthesis was carried out?
Here and in further synthesis and distillation methodology description state explicitly the
temperature of the process.
8. 2.2. Characterization:
“After desiccation in desiccator at 100 <U+25E6>C for 12 h.”
What was used for sample drying? Vacuum conditions or chemical reagent? In any case the
conditions should be obviously presented.
9. 2.3. Thermogravimetric analysis
“Vapor pressure curves can be obtained using the Antoine equation [18]:”
The same as point 5.
10. 2.3. Thermogravimetric analysis:
“The principle of using thermogravimetry to estimate the vapor pressure is based on the
Langmuir equation [19]:”
Irvine Langmuir has proposed this equation for vacuum conditions for the case of molecular
flow rate from the sample surface. Please indicate why this equation was used for atmospheric
pressures.
11. 2.3. Thermogravimetric analysis:
Langmuir equation. Why condensation coefficient is mentioned in left and right side of
equation?
12. 2.3. Thermogravimetric analysis:
“Benzoic acid has been assumed as a suitable material for this role [20, 21]. The enthalpy of
vaporization is calculated from the vapor pressure-temperature data using the Clausius-
Clapeyron equation:”
The use of reference material is widely used approach. But the vapor pressure data and
vaporization enthalpy values should be explicitly presented in the text of the article, as well as,
the experimentally determined vaporization enthalpy for this compound.
13. 3.2.1 Hafnium isopropoxide:
“Using the p-T data, plot of lnp versus 1/T is obtained as straight line for hafnium isopropoxide,
from which, using the Eq. (4), the slope gives -<U+2206>Hvap/R, and hence the vaporization enthalpy
(<U+2206>Hvap). The plot of ln p versus 1/T for hafnium isopropoxide and its linear fitting are shown in
Fig. 5, and from the slope the enthalpy of evaporation is calculated to be 110.5±0.39kJ mol-1”
1. Apparently, the experimental vapor pressure dependence depicted in Fig 5 is not linear but
convex. In this case the additional heat <U+F044>Cpvap should be applied or the effect of the vaporization
surface decrease with the mass loss should be accounted.
2. The vapor pressure calculated according to the Langmuir equation has the molar mass of
vapors as one of the components. In the case of salts like studied hafnium alkoxides the gas
phase consists of the wide variety of associated particles like monomeric form, dimers, trimers
and so on. The vaporization of each should be treated separately while the composition of the
gas phase will change with temperature. The best ways is to carry out in situ analysis of the gas
phase (for example with Mass spectrometry with low energy of electron impact) in order to
assess the vaporization enthalpy and vapor pressure correctly. The heating rate and gas flow
rate will not affect the association composition. And thus, carried out investigation does not
clarify the gas phase state of hafnium alkoxides, what is of crucial importance for ALD process.
14. 3.2 Thermal properties analysis and vapor pressure estimation:
For all compounds under study the simultaneous TGA/DTG/DTA was applied. The presence of
two or more peaks was used for assessment of the process under study (vaporization or
decomposition). At the same time the same two peaks were observe for benzoic acid in DTA.
Does it mean that the sample of benzoic acid also decomposed at rather mild conditions like 200
C?
Vaporization and decomposition are not the same as melting. They take place at each
temperature and if it obviously presented 360 C it does not mean that it not observed below
this temperature. It can have the lower rate the vaporization but still have a big part in the final
mass loss rate. Therefore, all investigations of this type should be combined with physical or
chemical analysis of the gas phase in the temperature range of investigation.
15. For all experimental values the type of uncertainty (standard or extended) and corresponding
level of confidence should be given.
16. It is better to find the English native speaker in order to resolve possible issues with English
throughout the text. Many sentences are too complicated and not clear.

To editor:
Dear Editor,
Thank you very much for sending us the ID RSOS-180688 Decision Letter on 18-
Jun-2018. We really appreciate your advice and the reviewer's comments to our
manuscript. We have studied all comments carefully, and thank you very much for
your time and thoughtful comments. We have now revised the manuscript in
accordance with the comments and suggestions. All changes made to the text are
highlighted with a red color. The entire comments are responded point by point as
follows.
To reviewer 1:
Thank you very much for your time and thoughtful comments again. If I remember
correctly, I've received a same review. Before this paper was submitted to RSOS,
we had studied all comments reviewer 1 put forward carefully and had revised the
manuscript in accordance with the constructive comments and suggestions.
Comments:
The vapor pressure and vaporization enthalpy for metal-organic compounds is an
indispensable part of application of such systems in CVD or ALD processes. At
the same time the incorrect data or incorrectly assessed values can bring too many
troubles for elimination of the substances for CVD or ALD. Thus the experimental
values determined in the current study of rather high importance but should be
significantly improved in the field of assessment of the studied process and
uncertainty of the final values. The following issues should be resolved before the
article can be published.
Comment 1: Abstract: What are “the evaporative properties”?
Answer 1: The evaporative properties refer to the properties of converting from
liquid to gas. Their evaluation indexes include boiling range and vapor pressure.
Comment 2: Abstract: Synthesized samples were subject to a simultaneous TGA
in a nitrogen atmosphere at 10 <U+25E6>C min-1 at 100 mL min-1.
This sentence is not clear. What do authors mean under simultaneous TGA? And
does it mean
“were subject to TGA”?
Answer 2: Thank you for pointing this out. Corresponding sentence had been
revised to “Synthesized samples were subject to a simultaneous
thermogravimetric–differential thermal analysis (TG–DTA) at 10 K min-1 in a dry
nitrogen atmosphere flowing at 100 mL min-1”.
Comment 3: Introduction: “In early years, TG is used in an isothermal condition,
but recently an elevated temperature program is used, which makes the
obtainment of data faster and reduces the number of samples required [7, 8]”
Thermogravimetry from the very beginning was used in scanning regime at
elevated temperatures? The idea of this sentence is absolutely not clear or poor.
Answer 3: According to reviewer’s comment, corresponding sentence had been
revised to “In earlier years, TG was used in an isothermal condition, but more
recently, an increasing temperature heating program, which makes the obtainment
of data faster and reduces the number of samples required [7,8], has been used in
TG. ”
Comment 4: Introduction: “this HfO2 layers” change for “these HfO2 layers”.
Answer 4: According to reviewer’s comment, corresponding sentence had been
revised.
Comment 5: Introduction: “Vapor pressure curves can be found using the Antoine
equation.” Antoine equation is only the fitting equation for vapor pressure and
can’t serve as the origin of vapor
pressure data for compounds.
Answer 5: Thank you very much for valuable suggestion. Corresponding sentence
had been revised.
Comment 6: Table 1: please state the origin of provided data (certificate or method
of determination)
Answer 6: According to reviewer’s constructive comment, method of
determination had been added to manuscript: the hafnium plates were made from
hafnium powders of metallurgical grade with self-resistance sintering, electron
bombardment and rolling treatment. In order to determine its chemical
composition, hafnium plate was dissolved in hydrofluoric acid of a required
concentration. The impurity contents were measured by ICP-Mass Agilent 7500a
analyzer, and the corresponding result was presented in Table 1 of manuscript.
Comment 7: 2.1. Materials and sample preparation:
“Electrochemical synthesis of the hafnium alkoxides was carried out under the
basic experimental conditions: anhydrous alcohol 2.2 L, conductive agent Et4NBr
0.04 M, required solution temperature (boiling temperature), polar distance 2 cm
and applied current 2A (current density 100A m-2).”
Why authors call that the basic conditions? At what temperature the synthesis was
carried out? Here and in further synthesis and distillation methodology description
state explicitly the temperature of the process.
Answer 7: Thank you for pointing this out. To describe it accurately, I had changed
“the basic conditions” to “the fixed condition”. The reason why we call that the
basic conditions before was that the condition under which hafnium alkoxides was
synthesized in the paper was determined based on the process-optimization
experiments we had carried out. The temperatures of the synthesis had been added
to the paper: The synthesis of hafnium isopropoxide, hafnium n-propoxide and
hafnium n-butoxide was carried out at 82.4 °C, 97.1 °C and 117.7 °C, respectively.
Comment 8: 2.2. Characterization:
“After desiccation in desiccator at 100 <U+25E6>C for 12 h.”
What was used for sample drying? Vacuum conditions or chemical reagent? In any
case the conditions should be obviously presented.
Answer 8: According to the reviewer's constructive instruction, corresponding part
had been revised. Anhydrous magnesium sulfate was used for sample drying.
Desiccation in desiccator was at 100 <U+25E6>C for 12 h under vacuum condition.
Comment 9: 2.3. Thermogravimetric analysis
“Vapor pressure curves can be obtained using the Antoine equation [18]:”
The same as point 5.
Answer 9: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, corresponding sentence had
been revised.
Comment 10: 2.3. Thermogravimetric analysis:
“The principle of using thermogravimetry to estimate the vapor pressure is based
on the Langmuir equation [19]:”
Irvine Langmuir has proposed this equation for vacuum conditions for the case of
molecular flow rate from the sample surface. Please indicate why this equation
was used for atmospheric pressures.
Answer 10: Thank you for pointing this out. Actually, estimating the vapor
pressure using thermogravimetry based on the Langmuir equation was carried out
on the basis of related literatures [1-3 etc.]. I am sorry to have no idea about the
reason. Please enlighten us if possible.

Comment 11: 2.3. Thermogravimetric analysis:
Langmuir equation. Why condensation coefficient is mentioned in left and right
side of equation?
Answer 11: Thank you for pointing this out. a in left side of the equation is unit
area (m2), while a in right side of the equation is condensation coefficient.
Comment 12: 2.3. Thermogravimetric analysis:
“Benzoic acid has been assumed as a suitable material for this role [20, 21]. The

The use of reference material is widely used approach. But the vapor pressure data
and vaporization enthalpy values should be explicitly presented in the text of the
article, as well as, the experimentally determined vaporization enthalpy for this
compound.
Answer 12: According to reviewer's constructive instruction, corresponding part
had been revised. The effect of temperature on the vapor pressure of benzoic acid
can be expressed by Eq. (1):
log p <U+F03D> A <U+F02D> B /(T <U+F02B> C )
(1)
Where A–C in the temperature range of 405 to 523 K are 7.80991, 2776.12, and
43.978, respectively [4].

Comment 13: 3.2.1 Hafnium isopropoxide:
“Using the p-T data, plot of lnp versus 1/T is obtained as straight line for hafnium
isopropoxide, from which, using the Eq. (4), the slope gives -<U+2206>Hvap/R, and hence
the vaporization enthalpy (<U+2206>Hvap). The plot of ln p versus 1/T for hafnium
isopropoxide and its linear fitting are shown in Fig. 5, and from the slope the
enthalpy of evaporation is calculated to be 110.5±0.39kJ mol-1”
1. Apparently, the experimental vapor pressure dependence depicted in Fig 5 is
not linear but convex. In this case the additional heat Cpvap should be applied or
the effect of the vaporization surface decrease with the mass loss should be
accounted.
2. The vapor pressure calculated according to the Langmuir equation has the molar
mass of vapors as one of the components. In the case of salts like studied hafnium
alkoxides the gas phase consists of the wide variety of associated particles like
monomeric form, dimers, trimmers and so on. The vaporization of each should be
treated separately while the composition of the gas phase will change with
temperature. The best ways is to carry out in situ analysis of the gas phase (for
example with Mass spectrometry with low energy of electron impact) in order to
assess the vaporization enthalpy and vapor pressure correctly. The heating rate and
gas flow rate will not affect the association composition. And thus, carried out
investigation does not clarify the gas phase state of hafnium alkoxides, what is of
crucial importance for ALD process.
Answer 13: According to reviewer's valuable instruction, corresponding part had
been revised. In order to assess the vaporization enthalpy and vapor pressure
correctly, mass spectra of the gas phase were obtained on MSQ8100 spectrometers
(direct introduction, 70 eV) at required temperature range. The mass-spectra are
given in Table 1, which indicates the presence of trimeric molecules in the gas
phase.

Comment 14: 3.2 Thermal properties analysis and vapor pressure estimation:
For all compounds under study the simultaneous TGA/DTG/DTA was applied.
The presence of two or more peaks was used for assessment of the process under
study (vaporization or decomposition). At the same time the same two peaks were
observe for benzoic acid in DTA. Does it mean that the sample of benzoic acid
also decomposed at rather mild conditions like 200 C?
Vaporization and decomposition are not the same as melting. They take place at
each temperature and if it obviously presented 360 C it does not mean that it not
observed below this temperature. It can have the lower rate the vaporization but
still have a big part in the final mass loss rate. Therefore, all investigations of this
type should be combined with physical or chemical analysis of the gas phase in
the temperature range of investigation.
Answer 14: According to reviewer's constructive instruction, corresponding part
had been revised. In the DTA plot for benzoic acid, there was one endothermic
peak in a lower temperature region, which is taken to be the melting point (Tm)
and one endothermic peak in the upper temperature region, which is taken to
represent evaporation [4]. In order to determine whether the decomposition of the
“Hf(OR)4” below the temperature mentioned above occurred, mass-spectra of
“Hf(OR)4” at given evaporation temperature ranges had been carried out.
Combined with the TG findings that for hafnium isopropoxide, trace white
residues appeared on the TG crucible at the ending of evaporation range, while for
hafnium n-propoxide and hafnium n-butoxide, a major amount of white residues
appeared on the TG crucible at the ending of evaporation range, it can be deduced
that the decomposition was likely to be much slower at the lower temperatures for
hafnium isopropoxide, and that hafnium n-propoxide and hafnium n-butoxide
were simultaneously undergoing evaporation and significant decomposition at
evaporation range.

Comment 15: For all experimental values the type of uncertainty (standard or
extended) and corresponding level of confidence should be given.
Answer 15: According to reviewer’s constructive instruction, corresponding part
had been revised.
Comment 16: It is better to find the English native speaker in order to resolve
possible issues with English throughout the text. Many sentences are too
complicated and not clear.
Answer 16: According to the reviewer's constructive instruction, we had checked
the manuscript carefully and tried our best to improve the expression of the whole
manuscript. The whole manuscript had been revised by a professional English
teacher as well.
To reviewer 2:
Comment 1: Introduction 2nd paragraph: Hafnium alkoxide is mainly used in
ALD [10]. This not true and the ref. 10 does not say that. Ref. 10 tells about the
density of the films. A better reference what precursors have been used in ALD
(and also in case of Hf ) is J. Appl. Phys. 113 (2013) 021301.
Answer 1: According to the reviewer's constructive suggestion, corresponding
reference has been changed in the revised manuscript.
Comment 2: The reference 11 is also bad if a general reference is wanted to show
the importance of HfO2 as high-k material. There are more than 5 000 papers on
this topic in the literature and best is to refer to a review. A good example could
be Mater. Sci. Reports 72 (2011) 97. Just to your information, in industrial scale
ALD HfOx are made for transistors from HfCl4.
Answer 2: According to the reviewer's valuable suggestion, corresponding
reference has been changed in the revised manuscript.
Comment 3: Same paragraph: … vapor pressure is a crucial parameter for
selecting precursors for ALD. Yes, volatility is the most important property.
However, for practical use of precursors we need the knowledge at which
temperature we can reach about 0.1 mbar pressure. Pressure is not a critical
parameter in an ideal ALD process – the only thing is that we have enough
precursor molecules to saturate the surface. Having said that it does not mean that
knowing the vapor pressure behavior is not important but it can be more important
outside ALD.
Answer 3: Thank you for pointing this out.
Comment 4: The experimental part is OK. The measurements are made carefully
and the knowledge on isopropoxide is useful. It is also useful to see that the other
alkoxides decompose.
Answer 4: Thank you for pointing this out.
Comment 5: Tables 5 and 9 are very short. Is it necessary to present the numbers
in a table. Numbers in Tables 6 and 7 are almost constant. Are the tables
needed? Text for Table 3 is very short and not understandable in present form.
Answer 5: According to reviewer’s suggestion, corresponding part has been
revised. Tables 5 and 9 show the parameters of the fitting line (y=a+bx) for
hafnium isopropoxide and hafnium n-propoxide in the plot of ln p against 1/T,
respectively. The datum in Table 5 and 9 correspond to those in Figure 6 and 9,
respectively. Table 6 presents the effect of different heating rates on the
vaporization enthalpies of hafnium isopropoxide at a constant nitrogen flow rate
of 100 mL min-1. Table 7 presents the effect of different nitrogen flow rates on the
vaporization enthalpies of hafnium isopropoxide at a constant heating rate of 10
K min-1. These Tables were made to search through datum easily. Table 3 records
the corresponding datum to calculate k using eq. 1. The datum in Table 3
correspond to those in Figure 4.
p=kv (1)
where k <U+F03D> 2<U+F070>R / <U+F061> and v=(1/a)(dm/dt) T / M .
To reviewer 3:
Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript by Chen et al described the synthesis, characterization of two Hf
alkoxides, and evaluated their potential in atomic layer deposition applications.
The results and discussions are well organized. The manuscript is well written.
However, due to the following reasons, major revision is recommended:
Comment 1: The authors claimed that they synthesized the Hf(OR)4 compounds:
‘the purity of hafnium alkoxides purified by reduced pressure distillation can be
up to 99.997%.’ It seems they did the calculation based on trace metal impurity.
However, they didn’t count organic impurities. If one checks the NMR spectra
carefully (Figures 2a and 2b), there are obvious impure peaks that are adjacent to
each product peak. This reviewer suspects there is unreacted alcohol. Did the
authors do Elemental Analysis to compare with calculated C/H amounts? The
authors likely used regular CDCl3 as deuterated solvent instead of anhydrous
CDCl3. If the authors obtained high purity product, the impurity such as trace
water may lead to decomposition and thus impurity peaks. The purity can’t be so
high as 99.997% if considering the impurities by NMR.
Answer 1: Thank you for pointing this out. The Hf(OR)4 are acutely sensitive to
water and easy to suffer hydrolysis. The process can be expressed as follows:
Hf(OR)4+4H2O<U+2192>Hf (OH)4+4ROH R is alkyl
Hf(OR)4+ Hf(OH)4<U+2192>2HfO2 +4ROH
Hf(OH)4+ Hf(OH)4<U+2192>HfO2 +H2O
So it’s hard to determine its contents by ICP or other methods measuring the
sample in aqueous solution. Therefore, in order to determine impurity contents of
Hf(OR)4, some amount of water was added into Hf(OR)4 solution for hydrolysis
reaction. After desiccation in desiccator under vacuum conditions at 100 °C for 12
h, the sample was calcined in muffle furnace at 800 °C for 2 h. The impurity
contents were obtained by ICP-Mass Agilent 7500a analyzer. And then the
impurity content of hafnium oxide was converted into that of Hf(OR)4. In addition,
mass spectra of Hf(OR)4 were obtained on MSQ8100 spectrometers (direct
introduction, 70 eV) at required temperature range. The mass-spectra are given in
Table 1, which indicates the presence of pure trimeric molecules. Furthermore, No
bands can be observed within the range 3600-3100 cm-1 in Figure 1 of manuscript.
This indicates that the samples were well preserved and the partial hydrolyzation
has not occurred, and, thus, there should be no unreacted alcohol. As for CDCl3
mentioned above, I have no idea about it. Please enlighten us if possible.

Comment 2: The authors mentioned previous work by Yang et al. on Hf
tetrabutoxide. Please compare the results with Yang’s and comment.
Answer 2: According to review’s constructive suggestion, corresponding changes
have been made in the revised manuscript. In Yang et al’s paper, the deposition of
hafnium oxide films on silicon substrates by MOCVD was investigated using the
newly employed novel single precursor hafnium 3-methyl-3-pentoxide (Hf(mp)4).
The reaction mechanism was clearly identified by the analysis of its thermal
decomposition. The deposition characteristics were investigated together with the
composition, crystallinity, and electrical properties of the deposited films. The
properties of the Hf(mp)4 single precursor were compared with other hafnium
alkoxide precursors. Probably because the authors mainly focus on the thermal
property of Hf(mp)4, the thermal property of the hafnium t-butoxide is only simply
mentioned as a comparison. The result and discussion for hafnium t-butoxide
quoted from the reference only has a sentence: “The hafnium t-butoxide was
measured by TGA and was detected giving the residue of almost 30%, which is
much more than that of Hf(mp)4”. Compared to our results, the residue of hafnium
t-butoxide (almost 30%) is higher than that of hafnium isopropoxide (almost 22%),
but less than those of hafnium n-propoxide (44 %) and hafnium n-butoxide (41.6%),
respectively.
Comment 3: Figure 2a: the integrals are not correct and should be 4H and 24H.
Comment 4: Figure 2b: the integrals are not correct and should be 8H, 8H and 12H.

To editor:
Dear Editor,
Thank you very much for sending us the ID RSOS-181193 Decision Letter on 18-
Sep-2018. We really appreciate your advice and the reviewer's comments to our
manuscript. We have studied all the comments carefully, and thank you very much
for your time and thoughtful comments. We have now revised the manuscript in
accordance with the comments and suggestions. All changes made to the text are
highlighted with a red color. The entire comments are responded point by point as
follows.
To reviewer 1:
Comments:
It seems the authors are not familiar with NMR and MNova software, or this
reviewer didn’t make it clear enough. To use NMR in characterizing compounds
with protons, one uses absolute proton numbers instead of the ratios as the authors

Please click ‘mannul’ integration, then put the cursor on peak A, right click and
choose ‘edit integral’, then you may want to change ‘normalized value’ to the
absolute proton numbers of peak A. Now, all the numbers you see will be the real
(absolute) proton numbers.
Speaking of CDCl3, the authors responded 'As for CDCl3 mentioned above, I have
no idea about it. Please enlighten us if possible.' First, that is the deuterated solvent
the authors indicatetd in the following spectra, and 'choroform-d' is a typo and
should be 'chloroform-d'; second, usually CDCl3 solvent is acidic and has trace
amount of water, which sometimes causes decomposition or line broadening of
the sample.
Hf(OR)4 is far less sensitive than many organometallic compounds that my lab
and all other organometallic chemistry labs work on. So it is absolutely an NMR
that can be done relatively easily without hydrolysis or decomposition. Thus, this
reviewer is not convinced whether the impurity NMR peaks come from unreacted
starting materials or hydrolysis by impure deuterated solvent. No matter what, the
NMR spectra show a mixture of at least two compouns for all the three cases.

don’t use the
ratios! Why don’t the authors change the integrals as I suggested and a chemist
would do?

Answers: According to reviewer’s constructive comment and instruction,
corresponding parts have been revised. All of the integral values for peaks in 1H
NMR spectra have been changed to the absolute proton numbers using
‘normalized value’ function in the MNova software. All the typos of 'choroform-
d' in the figures have been revised to 'chloroform-d'. Details are presented in Figure
1. It is worth mentioning that mass spectra of Hf(OR)4 were obtained on MSQ8100
spectrometers (direct introduction, 70 eV) at required temperature range. The
mass-spectra are given in Table 1, which indicates the presence of pure trimeric
molecules. Furthermore, No bands can be observed within the range 3600-3100
cm-1 in Figure 1 of manuscript. This indicates that the samples were well preserved
and the partial hydrolyzation has not occurred, and, thus, there should be no
unreacted alcohol. Therefore, the impurity peak in the spectra may be attributed to
the hydrolysis of Hf(OR)4 by the trace amount of water in CDCl3 solvent since the
Hf(OR)4 is acutely sensitive to water and easy to suffer hydrolysis.

To reviewer 2:
Comments:
In the work of Changhong Wang et al., in order to identify a volatile metallo-
organic precursor for the deposition of HfO2 films for atomic layer deposition
(ALD) applications, the evaporative properties of three hafnium alkoxides were
investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Hafnium isopropoxide,
hafnium n-propoxide and hafnium n-butoxide were synthesized by
electrochemical method and characterized by Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) analysis techniques. Synthesized samples were subjected to
a simultaneous thermogravimetric–differential thermal analysis (TG–DTA) unit at
10 K min-1 in a dry nitrogen atmosphere flowing at 100 mL min-1. And then, a
modified Langmuir equation was used to calculate vapor pressure curves for
hafnium isopropoxide and hafnium n-propoxide. The vapor pressure curve of
hafnium isopropoxide was calculated to be
lnp=31.157(±0.200)-13130.57(±56.50)/T. However, no curve was constructed for
hafnium n-propoxide and hafnium n-butoxide because these two compounds
undergo evaporation and deposition simultaneously.
The manuscript is mostly well written, the method seems to be appropriate and
properly conducted. However, explanations of the experimental procedures and
results are not sufficient. Some more explanations need to be added to make the
study more comprehensible. In addition, the authors need some improvements to
English, many sentences are absolutely not clear (see details below). The
presentation of this work can be improved and have listed my suggestions below.
At this stage, my recommendation for this manuscript is major revision.
Specific Comments:
Comment 1: Page 20, “Thermal property is of prime consideration……predict
the desired conditions and is favorable for process investigation.” This sentence is
too complicated and not clear.
Answer 1: According to reviewer’s valuable suggestion, corresponding sentence
has been revised. Thermal property is of prime consideration in evaluating the
feasibility of a metallo-organic compound as a precursor in ALD, since a precursor
must be thermally stable under the conditions required to transport its vapors to
the substrate zone, to avoid pressure build up and escape of material. Vapor
pressure (VP) is a crucial parameter of thermal property for selecting a precursor
suited to ALD, because the VP is important to predict the desired conditions and
is favorable for process investigation.
Comment 2: Page 21, 3.2 characterization, the scan times and resolution of the
FTIR measurements should be given.
Answer 2: According to reviewer’s constructive suggestion, corresponding part
has been revised in the manuscript.
Comment 3: Page 21, “Then, the distillation temperature was raised to
corresponding temperature to remove a little amount of ester.” What does the
“corresponding temperature” mean? This sentence is not clear.
Answer 3: Thank you for pointing this out. Corresponding temperature of
removing ester is around 423.15 K. After removal of the ester, the temperature
rises again. Corresponding part has been revised in the manuscript.
Comment 4: Page 21, “And then the impurity content of hafnium oxide was
converted into that of hafnium alkoxides.” I’m wondering where does the hafnium
oxide comes from. More explanations should be added here.
Answer 4: According to reviewer’s constructive instruction, corresponding
explanation has been added in the manuscript. In order to determine impurity
contents of hafnium alkoxides, some amount of water was added into hafnium
alkoxides solution for hydrolysis reaction:
Hf(OR)4+2H2O<U+2192>HfO2 +4ROH
After desiccation in desiccator under vacuum conditions at 100 °C for 12 h, the
sample was calcined in muffle furnace at 800 °C for 2 h. The impurity contents
were obtained by ICP-Mass Agilent 7500a analyzer. And then the impurity content
of hafnium oxide was converted into that of hafnium alkoxides.
Comment 5: In the whole text, both “<U+2103>” and “K” were used for temperature,
which should be revised to maintain consistency.
Answer 5: According to reviewer’s constructive comment, corresponding parts
have been revised in the manuscript.
Comment 6: Page 21, “the direct electrochemical synthesis of hafnium alkoxides
compared with the traditional method has a greater promise owing to its
remarkable advantages.” “compared with the traditional method” can be deleted.
Answer 6: Thank you for pointing this out. Corresponding part has been revised
in the manuscript.
Comment 7: Page 21, “Detailed reasons were described previously in our study.”
“study” should be “studies”.
Answer 7: According to reviewer’s comment, corresponding part has been revised
in the manuscript.
Comment 8: Page 21, “hafnium alkoxides was successfully obtained by
Turevskaya et al”. “et al” should be “et al.”
Answer 8: According to reviewer’s comment, corresponding part has been revised
in the manuscript.
Comment 9: Page 21, TGA, FT-IR, 1H-NMR and ICP appeared in the main body
for the first time without full name.
Answer 9: According to reviewer’s valuable comment, corresponding part has
been revised in the manuscript.
Comment 10: Page 22, “Peaks at around 2970 cm-1 and 2860 cm-1 correspond to
asymmetric and symmetric stretch vibrations, respectively.” Which functional
group does these two peaks belong to?
Answer 10: Thank you for pointing this out. Peaks at around 2970 cm-1 and 2860
cm-1 correspond to d(C—H) stretching vibration.
Comment 11: Page 23, “Corresponding datum, which have been used to construct
Figure 4, to calculate k are given in table 3, in which the values of pcalc. are obtained
from the fitting line of plot of p against v.” This sentence doesn't read smoothly.
Answer 11: Thank you for pointing this out. Corresponding sentence in the
manuscript has been revised. Corresponding datum, which have been used to
construct Figure 4, to calculate k are given in table 3. The values of pcalc. in table
3 are obtained from the fitting line of plot of p against v.
Thanks to the referees for the thoughtful and thorough review. We have made
careful modification on the original manuscript. We sincerely hope the present
manuscript with the above revisions and replies is acceptable for publication in
your journal.
Great thanks to you and the referees for the time and effort expended on this paper.

Comment 1: Although I have raised that some sentences in the manuscript are too
complicated and not clear, the authors just did a few punctuation tweaks in the
revised version.
Answer 1: According to reviewer’s constructive comment and instruction,
corresponding parts have been revised in the revised manuscript.
Comment 2: Once again, the scan times of the FTIR measurements should be
given for clear presentation.
After the modification made by the authors, the revised manuscript is much better
than the previous edition. However, the authors should carefully check the format
and English of the article. It would be a qualified manuscript after the authors take
care of these details.
Answer 2: According to reviewer’s constructive comment and instruction,
corresponding parts have been revised in the revised manuscript. The scan times
of 32 in the FTIR measurements have been added to the revised manuscript. The
