This manuscript covers an interesting topic, i.e. the effect of defoliation by insects on forest C-and
N-cycles. It is methodologically well done, presented in a very precise and organized way, and
understandable for a broad audience of ecologists. I have found only a few points which may
deserve revision by the authors. These points are listed below, in the order of reading:
Title:
The chosen title is very broad and general (sounds more like a review title). In my point of view,
a more precise title, which may already emphasize a message, would be a better choice. The term
"forest pests" includes also bark beetles which are not touched by this study. What about
something like that: "Defoliation by insects alter carbon and nitrogen fluxes in a temperate forest"
Key words:
likewise, a few more key words can be given to outline the topic a bit more precisely, e.g.
"defoliation", "temperate forest"
Abstract:
line 41 -> to add "total net canopy-to-soil fluxes of C and N" to specify the direction of fluxes
line 54 -> to add "soil treaments" so that it is clearer what kind of treatments you refer to
Intro:
general:
Defoliation can cause subsequent tree mortality, e.g. depending on severity and time of an attack,
as well as on the host species. But obviously you refer to non-mortality defoliation events in your
introduction (as you studied such kind of defoliation). This difference should be clarified
somewhere.
p2, line 23 -> maybe "throughfall" is not clear for everyone and should be explained shortly here
p3, line7 ff -> here you introduce the species with common and scientific names, but this is done
in the first part of M&M again and shoud be skipped either here or in M&M, otherwise it sounds
repetitive
p3, line 21 -> to add which element fluxes you have quantified
p3, line 23 -> "three subsequent years"
p3, line 27 -> "C" not yet explained (unless in the abstract), can be done in line 21 when listing the
element fluxes
Mat&Meth
general:
It is not totally clear (1) if your infested plots have been infested also in years previous to the
study years or if infestation has started in the first study year, (2) if defoliation has occurred
continuously in year one to year three, (3) what was the severity of defoliation, e.g. percentage of
foliage loss, and (4) whether the host has re-flushed in the same season or not. A clarification
would be very helpful for the interpretation of your results.
You are using sometimes spaces between value and unit, and sometimes not -> homogenization
needed throughout the whole text
p3, line 57 -> why the growing season is May-Oct here and May-Sept in your results? period
should be homogenized
p3, line 59 -> is "Northwest German Forest Reserch Institute" a reference, not clear
p4, line 14 -> "during the entire growing season each of three years" seem to miss a word, not
clear
3
p4, line 39 -> "TNb" can be also introduced here, later you can just use abbreviations for all
introduced terms
p4, line 41 -> "0.45-" or "0.45"? (same in p5, line55)
p5, line 3 -> "mass dry mass"?
p5, line 39 -> why you are using faeces of a different moth species for your microcosm
experiments, not clear? as you have introduced two other species as study object, this appears
non expected and a bit confusing here
Results:
An additional result which you haven´t mentioned explicitly but which I find interesting, is that
faeces contribute most to canopy-to-soil fluxes compared to litter and troughfall (Fig. 1). I would
have expected litter to contribute most.
p6, line 31 -> what means "positively correlated" here? to the number of years? not clear
p6, line 35 -> P is not shown in Fig. 1 (and can principally also skipped from the manuscript I
think without reducing the quality of the study)
p6, line 37 ff -> sufficient to use introduced abbreviations only
p7, line 7 -> "Fig." instead of "figure"
p7, line 14 ff -> "time" means "week"? not clear
Discussion:
p7, line 47 -> "via after N deposition"? not clear
p8, line 12 -> as mentioned before, it is important to clarify if such an outbreak lead to tree
mortality or not (both options are realistic for bark beetles, defoliators, other insect guilds or
pathogens)
p9, line 19 -> "condition" or "...s"?
References:
Need consistency check! some journal titles are abbreviated (with dot, without dot), other not...
author initials with/without space... check author initials in ref 30... publication titles all capitals
or only start with capital ...
Table 1:
again, "time" means "week"?
The total standard error in the last column seems to be wrong, "39.8" instead of "9.8"

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors present an interesting data set of select fluxes in forests impacted by the winter moth
and mottled umber defoliation. They attempt to quantify the fluxes of C and N deriving from
insect feces, litterfall and throughfall in oak forests both impacted and non impacted by leaf
herbivores. While I believe their data set is unique, it is largely confirmatory as it is well
recognized that soil respiration is stimulated by labile carbon inputs. Furthermore, their field
study lacked appropriate linkage to the ecosystem scale to fully untangle the relationships
between soil inputs and respiration (specifically the authors disregard potential differences in
stocking density/ basal area/ or some other productivity metric to soil respiration, which seems
necessary since soil respiration is tightly linked to productivity).
Below I have a list of minor suggestions/comments that should help the authors bolster the
paper. The relative length of this list reflects my interest in the subject and should not be taken as
negative criticism.
Keywords: I suggest adding ‘disturbance’ to your list of keywords.
Page 1, line 2: I suggest changing your title to reflect your specific study and findings more
clearly. This is general and more worthy of a review article. Perhaps something like ‘Herbivore
outbreak in an oak forest increases growing season fluxes of N and C from the canopy to the
forest floor and stimulate soil C efflux’
Page 1, line 42/43 and throughout: change faeces to feces.
Page 1, line 52: change ‘in microcosm’ to ‘in a microcosm’
Page 1, Line 56: when you mention your mesocosm findings here, its not clear which pool you are
quantifying these from. i.e. are your increases in fluxes from the soil (heterotrophs, autotrophs,
bulk) or ecosystem (NEE)?
Page 2, Line 18-19: see also review article by Flower and Gonzalez-Meler (2015) Responses of
temperate forest productivity to insect and pathogen disturbances. Annual Review in Plant
Biology 66: 547-569 which highlights the importance of pests/pathogens on forest carbon cycling.
Page 2, Line 24/25: your not incorrect that these fluxes are not directly measured often, but they
are already inherently included in most large flux operations (EuroFlux,Ameriflux).
Unfortunately these networks don’t get hit by these disturbances frequently.
Page 2, line 33/34: also see Flower and Gonzalez-Meler mentioned before.
Page 2, line 47/48: change “thereby relatively increasing nutrient poor…” to ‘thereby increasing
the abundance of nutrient poor…’ or something
Page 2, line 49/50: Your decelerating effect as you discuss is fair, however wouldn’t increased N
rich frass deposition also increase the foliar quality of the previously nutrient poor tissue too, so it
may also be foraged upon.
Page 3, ln 18/19: Change ‘vastly’ to severely or something else.
Page 3, ln 52-57: what period are these measurements from? (2015 or 2000-2010)
Page 4, ln 4/5: change “that were spatially closely located” to “that were located within close
spatial proximity to each other” or something.
Page 4, line 6/7: be specific about your element fluxes (C, N, etc)
Page 4, line 12-15: At which point did you collect your faeces and leaf litter measurements? At the
end of the year or weekly?
Page 5, linen 9/10- suggest changing vastly to severely
5
Page 5, line 31/32: change “of soil according of” to ‘of soil according to’ or something else.
Page 5, line 43/44: change 120-years to 120-year
Page 6, line 4/5: change “across a seven weeks study” to “across the seven week study”.
Page 6, line 23/24: can you qualify this sentence more specifically: The fecal deposition, or the
throughfall, the litter fall…
Page 6, line 23-35: Did you collect litterfall too (or at the end of the experiment)? Its plausible that
C and N fluxes would have been more similar if you totaled all litterfall (frass, throughfall, and
leaf litter) over the course of the course of the year. i.e. did the insects change the periodicity of
the deposition and the amount, or just the deposition amount.
Page 6, line 49/50: and statistic on your pH values?
Page 7, line 1: what do you mean “being marked”? are you suggesting that you ran a repeated
measures test here?
Page 7, line 11/12: change “weeks” to week
Page 7, line 16/17: did you run soil moisture measurements over the course of the incubations?
Or periodically take the mass of the container with soil. Your fecal additions could have increased
moistyre content which in turn would have increased moisture content.
Page 7: line 29-37: this is a run on sentence.
Page 7, line 36/37: change “… and increases nutrient cycling” to “… and increases the rate of
nutrient cycling”
Page 8, line 11-12: Yes, but keep in mind that this depends on the degree of defoliation and the
numbers of years impacted. If repeatedly defoliated, trees can be killed.
Page 8, line 51/51: change “attributed N deposition” to “attributed to N deposition”
Page 8, line 53/54: change “in the course of a pest outbreak” to “during the course of a …”
Page 9, line 9-13: Yes, but the nutrients may largely come down as litter at the end of the growing
season, so the net deposition doesn’t need to have increased too much, just the timing.
Page 9, Line 21-23: Elaborate on these environmental variables and ecological processes in more
detail here or elsewhere.

effort to fully address the comments (see below). Also, we added Norbert Lamersdorf as a co-
author, who meets the criteria.
Sincerely,
Anne l. M-Arnold

Referee 1:
- Title: We agree and made the title of the paper more precise: “Forest defoliator pests
alter carbon and nitrogen cycles”
- Key words are added.
- Line 41 & line 54: done
- Introduction (general): We refer to “non-mortality defoliation” in the last paragraph of
the introduction.
- Introduction:
p2, 23: done
p3, 7 ff: done
p3, 21 & p3, 27: We refer to the material and method section for a list of quantified
elements
- Material and methods (general): We give the percentage of foliage loss and added
information on tree mortality (see the first paragraph of the material and method
section).
- Material and methods:
p3, 57: done
p3, 59: We give the original reference.
p4, 14: corrected
p4, 39: done
p4, 41 & p5, 3: corrected
p5, 39: We added more information on the faeces used in the experiment.
- Results (first comment): Now we point out that faeces contributes most to canopy-to-
soil fluxes (see first paragraph of the results section).
p6, 31: “positively correlated is better explained now” (see first paragraph of the
results section).
p6, 35: We agree and skipped “P” results from the ms.
p6, 37 ff.: done
p7, 7: done
p7, 14 ff.: We deleted “time-1” as the space of time is indicated in the text.
- Discussion:
p7, 47: corrected
p8, 12: We operate this point in the second paragraph of the discussion and mention
that outbreaks in our study did not lead to tree mortality.
P9, 19: corrected
- References: checked and corrected
- Table 1: The term “time” is deleted as “time” is indicated in rows. The values are
corrected. Also, we give standard erros and not standard deviations in the last row.
Referee 2:
- We slightly relativized our results as an example of a defoliator pest outbreak in oak
forests (see the first sentence of the discussion). Moreover, we explicitly refer to the
link between soil respiration and productivity as well as to possible large-scale
ecosystem consequences in the last paragraph of the discussion now.
- Keywords are revised
- p1, 2: Title revised (see above)
- p1, 42/43: We maintain British style (“faeces” instead of “feces”).
- p1, 52: done
- p1, 56: We now mention “heterotrophic respiration”.
- p2, 18-19: We cite Flower & Gonzales-Meler (2015) (see also ff.)
- p2, 24-25: We mention that these fluxes are also included in a condensed form in
large-scale operations.
- p2, 33/34: We cite Flower & Gonzales-Meler (2015) elsewhere (see ff.).
- p2, 49/50: This idea is interesting, but does not meet the main hypothesis. We
therefore skipped it.
- p3, 18/19: done
- p3, 52-57: The information is now included in the material & methods section.
- p4, 4/5: done
- p4, 6/7: We refer to the next paragraph.
- p4, 12-15: Information is given now.
- p5, 9/19: done
- p5, 31/32: done
- p5, 43/44: done
- p6, 4/5: done
- p6, 23-35: We mention that “total annual deposition of leaf litter should be lower by
the proportion of foliage loss in infested compared to uninfested forest” (see first
paragraph of the material and method section).
- p6, 49/50: We deleted pH-values from the results.
- p7, 1: We deleted “being marked”.
- p7, 11/12: done
- p7, 16/17: Soil moisture measurements were performed using tested methods (see
Carter & Gregorich, 2007). We give this information in paragraph 2 of the material
and method section.
- p7, 29-37: Sentence improved
- p7, 36/37: done
- p8, 11/12: We refer to “non-mortality defoliation” (see the last paragraph of the
introduction), give the percentage of foliage loss and added the information on tree
mortality (see the first paragraph of the material and method section).
- p8, 51/52: done
- p8, 53/54: done
- p9, 9-13:We operate this point in the first paragraph of the material and method
section by mentioning that “total annual deposition of leaf litter may prove to be
higher in uninfested compared to infested forests”.
- p9, 21-23. We give examples of environmental variables and ecological functioning in
the last paragraph of the discussion.
