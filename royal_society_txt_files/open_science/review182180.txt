I reviewed this manuscript previously when it was submitted to Proceedings of the Royal Society
B. Generally, I think the majority of the concerns raised in the initial review were adequately
addressed with the revisions, with one important exception; the interpretation of the strength of
support for the alternative path analysis models. Models 1-3 are effectively all equally well
supported (within 3 AIC of best model), and they each provide very different interpretations of
the effect of hissing behaviour on breeding parameters and nest success. I think the only
conclusion that can be drawn from this is that the role of hissing behaviour in shaping these other
parameters is totally unclear. Although the authors vaguely acknowledge this in the
discussion,they go on to primarily interpret the results of model 3. Further, the abstract presents
the results of model 1 without clarifying that there are two alternative interpretations that are
equally well supported, including no relationship between hissing and any of the other
parameters.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Alexander Ophir):
Dear Dr. Thys,
I have received the comments from two expert reviewers and as you can find they were both
pleased by the degree to which you addressed issues raised int he past. However one reviewer
continues to emphasize the importance of more equitably discussing the three possible models
5
that received relatively equal support. The reviewer acknowledges that you have now mentioned
this point, but they indicate that you have not done this sufficiently, such that you appear to
favor one interpretation over others that statistically are equally good. I think you should more
directly address this issue. There are several way sin which I think you could accomplish this, for
example, you could walk back your interpretation and/or provide deeper discussion of the other
ways to interpret the results based on the other models, or you can provide justification for why
your preferred model deserves more prominence. Whatever you decide, I think that it is an
important enough issue that it merits some more thought. This point notwithstanding, you have
produced a nice study that clearly has generated some positive interest and I look forward to
receiving your responses.
Editor comments:
It appears that the reviewers are generally satisfied with the revisions, with one exception
detailed by the AE. Please address this in your next version, and thanks for submitting.

The authors are now explicit about their criteria (delta AIC >2) for considering a significant

Comments to the Author(s)
I reviewed this manuscript previously when it was submitted to Proceedings of the
Royal Society B. Generally, I think the majority of the concerns raised in the initial
review were adequately addressed with the revisions, with one important
exception; the interpretation of the strength of support for the alternative path
analysis models. Models 1-3 are effectively all equally well supported (within 3 AIC
of best model), and they each provide very different interpretations of the effect of
hissing behaviour on breeding parameters and nest success. I think the only
conclusion that can be drawn from this is that the role of hissing behaviour in
shaping these other parameters is totally unclear. Although the authors vaguely
acknowledge this in the discussion,they go on to primarily interpret the results of
model 3. Further, the abstract presents the results of model 1 without clarifying that
there are two alternative interpretations that are equally well supported, including
no relationship between hissing and any of the other parameters.
Response:
First of all, we like to thank the reviewer for the time and effort in re-assessing our
manuscript, as well as the valuable comments during the initial review which vastly
improved our manuscript. We are also pleased to hear that the reviewer thinks we
adequately addressed the concerns raised in the initial review, notwithstanding the
exception outlined above.
Regarding the comment outlined above, we acknowledge that a solid description of
the interpretation of (<U+0394>)AIC was lacking in the previous version of the manuscript.
In general (see e.g. [1-3]), models that have an AIC value within two of the model
with the lowest AIC value are considered to be equally supported and can hence be
considered equivalent. However, models with <U+0394>AIC values greater than two relative
to the model with the lowest AIC value suggest decreased support. Of course this
does not mean that these models do not find any support, or the falsification of
these models, but simply indicates that they find less (decreased) support, relative
to the model with the lowest AIC value. We now explicitly clarify this in the statistics
section (L186-191). Moreover, throughout the manuscript (including the abstract,
L22-23) we now explicitly mention that it is our best supported path-model (i.e.
model 3) that suggests that hissing behavior most likely relates to clutch size (see
also L248-250; L343-346). We believe this to be not overstating the results, given
we can effectively differentiate between model 3 and models 1-2 based on <U+0394>AIC
(>2), and model 3 therefore does present to best supported (hence most likely)
scenario. However, given models 1-2 are within 3 AIC of the best supported model,
there is indeed some caution needed for the interpretation of our results. We do
agree with the reviewer that in our previous version this was done too vaguely.
Therefore, we now more explicitly mention in our discussion that the model in
which hissing behaviour is independent of reproductive decisions (i.e. model 1) or
only related to lay date (i.e. model 2) cannot be dismissed, and that further research
is therefore necessary to validate our results (please see L312-321).
