This work examines sperm expenditure in male chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) in an
experimental context. The authors use an interesting approach to measure the volume of sperm
release by males, which allows them to measure the amount of sperm males release in the
presence of females that vary in size and spawning history. They find that males release more
sperm in the presence of large females, but do not tailor their sperm expenditure in relation to the
number of times a female has spawned.
I think that the approach used in this study is very compelling, and researchers studying both
sexual selection and salmonid mating systems would be interested in the results of this study.
One of my main concerns about this manuscript is the clarity of the methods. I had a very
difficult time understanding what was done and when. I think that this section should be re-
written, and I hope that my specific comments below offer some suggestions about how this
could be achieved. For example, I think this would be much easier to read if the vibration
measures section was placed after the description of the experiments and if the sperm collection
surgery were placed at the beginning of the methods (close to the ‘Data logger attachment’
section, given that it was done at the same time). I was initially not entirely certain about what the
3
objective of the first described experiment was (section d) – was this simply to correlate sperm
release with vibration measures? I assume that it was, and the second experiment (section e) was
done without directly measuring sperm release but rather using the vibration data to estimate it.
This needs to be much clearer.
My second concern is with the design of the experiment, and the conclusions that can be drawn
from it. The authors claim that males allocate sperm release to account for female size. While they
did find a relationship between sperm volume and female size, the degree to which this reflects a
male ‘decision’ in the absence of other females cannot be answered in this study. To do so, males
would need to be exposed to different females, which I understand was not the case here.
Finally, it would be extremely important to indicate the degree to which sperm depletion is an
issue in this species. At first glance, it seems that 30-40ul of sperm is not a large volume, and I
wonder if it is possible for males to deplete their sperm reserves without replenishment if the
volume released at a given spawning event is relatively low. Furthermore, is there an information
available regarding how quickly a male may replenish his sperm?
Introduction
Line 66. Remove the word ‘the’ before ‘sperm allocation’
Line 81. Perhaps this phrase should indicate that females guard their nests to avoid having their
eggs uncovered by other females (rather than buried).
Line 85. Remove the word ‘that’ from the sentence that ends on this line.
Line 99. Perhaps change ‘proximate’ to ‘nearby’
Lines 105-106. I’m not certain that I understand the prediction pertaining to male preference of
relatively larger females; if it is of benefit for males to allocate sperm because of the benefits of
mating with large females, shouldn’t this be only in absolute terms? I am thinking here of
extremes in male size- would very large or very small males be expected to allocate sperm
differently in the presence of a particular female? I see after reading the entire manuscript that
relative size may be the only way for males to assess females given that they are only paired with
one, but this is still a curious prediction that requires a bit more detail for the reader.
Line 111. Briefly explain the difference between the sophisticated method used here and that of
Fitzpatrick and Liley.
Lines 118-120. It seems that the overall objective should be placed before the secondary objectives.
Methods
Lines 124-126. Indicate the number of fish each year.
Line 126. What does ‘fish were transported to an outdoor tank separately’ mean? Were sexes kept
separate or were they in small groups?
Line 139. Define “LF” as fork length for readers who might not be familiar with this terminology.
Lines 144-147. The wording in these sentences is awkward. Perhaps revise.
Line 151. Should the ‘vs’ be taken out of this header?
Lines 166-168. Were these fish used across different years or within a particular year?
Lines 168-169. Were all fish in the channel at the same time? I suspect not because it is rather
small. Please clarify this, and explain the design to the reader.
Line 181. Define ‘FA’ for the reader.
Line 190. Was this milt collected from the males in the experiment, and if so, how long
beforehand?
Lines 169-207. Perhaps this should be in a different section and placed prior to the experimental
information. It represents an interesting approach used in the study and should stand out for the
reader.
Line 204. Remove the word ‘the’ before ‘amount’.
Lines 216-217. Indicate here how these were spread across years (if this was the case).
Line 235. Remove the words ‘shown a’ from this sentence.
4
Line 243. My reading of the Results indicates that this was not a null model, but rather a
simplified one to examine the effect of a particular factor, which is sometimes the null model if
only one factor is being examined (at least I hope this is the case).
Results
Line 249. Clarify here for the reader that this is referring to the experiment using 8 males and 9
females.
Line 258. Change the wording for the sentence that begins on this line. Perhaps something more
like “Male fork length and mating number…’.
Line 272. Wasn’t male fork length used to estimate the amount of sperm released (as described in
section a) of the Results)?
Line 274. Please make it VERY clear to the reader that vibration duration here is for the female.
Line 279. Remove the word ‘the’ at the end of this line.
Line 288. Change the word ‘correlation’ to ‘relationship’.
Line 289. Is the number of eggs a total count or eggs per spawning?
Lines 297-299. This result does not relate to the previous sentence.
Table 1. The word ‘correlation’ should be replaced in this caption. These models are based in
regression.
Table 2. There are typographical errors in the word ‘event’ in the last two rows.
Discussion
Line 306. Female fecundity and egg number are the same thing (as far as I know). Perhaps re-
word this as the ‘In addition’ may make the reader think otherwise.
Line 338. Did egg quality decrease over successive spawning events?

"Sperm allocation in relation to female size in a semelparous salmonid"
Makiguchi et al.
This is a well written and generally interesting paper, and I recommend
publication after a few changes. The main deficiencies are reference to the
theoretical literature and in the statistical approach.
It would be useful for the authors to relate their hypothesis that males allocate
more sperm to larger females to the theoretical literature. One might also
suppose that larger females attract more mating attempts by males, and so
might also be subject to more intense sperm competition, and so this needs
also to be taken into account in making estimation of optimal male output.
Parker et al. 1999 Animal Behaviour is worth a look. Galvani and Johnston
are already there. A more modern look can be found in the appendix in E.
Harley et al 2013 Ecology and Evolution, based on a model by Tazzyman et
al 2009 Am. Nat.
L226 I am not sure I fully follow the size variables: 1) relative female to male
size, 2) male fork length, 3) female fork length. Is fork length = size. If yes,
these are somewhat repetitive measures as the ratio is no doubt correlated to
the individual measures (i.e. as male length increases , relative measure
decreases). In the GLMM it would make more sense to see whether the
addition of the ratio made any difference AFTER the individual male and
female measures were already accounted for. There seems to be a much
greater loading on female length – but again this could just be due to there
being much more variance in the female trait. So if there was no variance in
the male trait, both female size and ratio would be significant INDIVIDUAL
effects. The analysis needs to be revised. Also the AIC approach would allow
this to be examined – does a model with more effects explain more? (AICc
needed, all of which can be done in lme4 if I remember correctly).
The explanation on p19 seemed a bit odd to me – but I think this is mainly a
language problem. The finding is best explained if release of ejaculate in a
mating is negatively related to release of ejaculate in later ejaculates. This
must be related to the cost of production of sperm. But if this is the case, why
didn’t the authors see an effect on sperm production and mating event
number in males? Presumably because, the effect only is apparent after many
matings? What do the authors think is the case.
Minor

Response for the Reviewer #1:
This is a well written and generally interesting paper, and I recommend publication after a few
changes. The main deficiencies are reference to the theoretical literature and in the statistical
approach.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your helpful comments and criticisms of our manuscript. We
have carefully revised our manuscript as per your suggestions. The detailed changes to the
manuscript are described below.
It would be useful for the authors to relate their hypothesis that males allocate more sperm to
larger females to the theoretical literature. One might also suppose that larger females attract
more mating attempts by males, and so might also be subject to more intense sperm competition,
and so this needs also to be taken into account in making estimation of optimal male output.
Parker et al. 1999 Animal Behaviour is worth a look. Galvani and Johnston are already there. A
more modern look can be found in the appendix in E. Harley et al 2013 Ecology and Evolution,
based on a model by Tazzyman et al 2009 Am. Nat.
RESPONSE: We appreciate the constructive comment regarding the potential for sperm
competition to play a role in determining how much sperm males allocate to females that
differ in size (and presumably quantity and quality of gametes). We considered adding
some text linking sperm competition and sperm allocation (the theoretical underpinnings
we are aware of) but because we did not examine multiple males (i.e. we only examined on
male spawning with a female in order to focus on allocation issues related to female size
and not number of mates) the reference to sperm competition would be tangential and
misleading to readers. However, we do cite reviews and studies which contain relevant
theoretical constructs linked to female quality and sperm allocation. We cite reviews by
Dewsbury 1982 and Galvani and Johnston 1998 and we also cite empirical studies (e.g.
Rubolini et al. 2006, Hooper et al. 2016) that find that males were sensitive to female size and
produced larger ejaculates when mating with larger females, which were more fecund in terms
of number of eggs produced.
L226 I am not sure I fully follow the size variables: 1) relative female to male size, 2) male fork
length, 3) female fork length. Is fork length = size. If yes, these are somewhat repetitive
measures as the ratio is no doubt correlated to the individual measures (i.e. as male length
increases relative measure decreases). In the GLMM it would make more sense to see whether
the addition of the ratio made any difference AFTER the individual male and female measures
were already accounted for. There seems to be a much greater loading on female length – but
again this could just be due to there being much more variance in the female trait. So if there
was no variance in the male trait, both female size and ratio would be significant INDIVIDUAL
effects. The analysis needs to be revised. Also the AIC approach would allow this to be
examined – does a model with more effects explain more? (AICc needed, all of which can be
done in lme4 if I remember correctly).
RESPONSE: We appreciate the constructive comments regarding the statistical analyses.
In this study, we selected the pairs of male and female fish randomly. As the reviewer
suggests, if there is no variation in male size both female size and the ratio would be
significant individual effects. We conducted an F test to examine variance of fork length
between sexes. The results suggest that there was no significant difference in variance of
fork length between the sexes (p = 0.165), suggesting that the individual effect is of
relatively low importance in the analysis. We have now added this result to this section (see
lines 230-231). In addition, as per the reviewer’s comments, we have added the AICc
values in Table 1, 2, and S2, respectively. Table S1 and S3 include count data as an
explanatory variable and sample size of data in Table 3 is much larger than that of the
other tables. Therefore, in this case we did not calculate AICc values as it would not be
appropriate.
The explanation on p19 seemed a bit odd to me – but I think this is mainly a language problem.
The finding is best explained if release of ejaculate in a mating is negatively related to release of
ejaculate in later ejaculates. This must be related to the cost of production of sperm. But if this is
the case, why didn’t the authors see an effect on sperm production and mating event number in
males? Presumably because, the effect only is apparent after many matings? What do the
authors think is the case.
RESPONSE: In the current study, we observed several spawning events for the same pair
and the duration between previous and subsequent spawning events is thus strongly
dependent on female motivation to spawn. For this reason, we believe this is why we did
not find a relationship the production of sperm (which is presumed to be costly), duration
between mating that males can control and sperm allocation. We believe that this
questions is an interesting and important one for understanding the evolution of
reproduction in semelparous salmonids and is one of the next objectives we will examine in
the near future.
Minor
1. P5, bottom. The authors cite review on mate choice. But it would be more appropriate to
mention reviews of MALE mate choice here. There are lots, and most show evidence of
selection for fecundity (e.g. Bonduriansky 2001). This may limit the number of matings (e.g.
Wedell et al. 2002).
RESPONSE: We detailed some of the literature on mate choice including female and male
choice in salmonids in this same paragraph and cited two reviews on male mate choice (see
lines 80). We have also cited a study examining male mate choice in salmonids (i.e. Foote
C.J. 1988 Male mate choice dependent on male size in salmon. Behaviour 106, 63-80).
2. Line 146 delete “were used”
RESPONSE: We deleted “were used” in this sentence as per the reviewer’s suggestion.
3. Line 273, delete “Fig 3=S4”. There is no Figure 3. Same ambiguity l281
RESPONSE: As per the reviewer’s suggestion we have clarified the figure numbering in
the revised manuscript, for example, in L273. We also deleted “3=” and “S4=” in these
sentences as per the reviewer’s suggestion.
4. Table 1 legend does not explain full/reduced model. Full gives AIC for different models.
Reduced is what? It would also be useful to know the r2 value of the model as an estimate of
sperm release. Also, why not put the SI figure legends under the figures.
RESPONSE: We have added an explanation regarding the full/reduced model in Table 1
legend as Full model represents a model that includes all variables. The “reduced model”
represents a model that has removed one variable. For example, the reduced model of
"vibration duration at sperm release" model means that model with no variable (null
model).” We have also added r2 values of the model in Table 1 as per the reviewer’s
suggestion. Finally, we have now inserted the SI figure legends under the figures for
clarity.
5. Figure 2. These lines are regressions? So they are not correlations (as in the text e.g. l272).
Likewise Table 2
RESPONSE: The reviewer is correct that these lines are indeed regressions in Figure 2,
which is the relationship between estimated amount of sperm released and relative size of
female to male size or female size. In L272, we indicated that there was no significant
relationship between the amount of sperm estimated and the male fork length (Table 2, Fig
S4).
6. I like Fig. S1 with the condom fish – perhaps this should be included in the main text
RESPONSE: As per the reviewer’s suggestion we have included Fig S1 in the main text as
Fig 2.
7. Table 2. Mating event not envent
RESPONSE: As per the reviewer’s comment we have revised the typographical error
“envent” to “event” in Table2.
8. l303 delete “in the”
RESPONSE: We have now deleted “in the” on L303.
9. I’d include Figure S6 and S7 in the main text. They seem important to me.
RESPONSE: As per the reviewer’s suggestion we have now included Figure S6 and S7 in
the main text as Figure 3 and 4, respectively.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
This work examines sperm expenditure in male chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) in an
experimental context. The authors use an interesting approach to measure the volume of sperm
release by males, which allows them to measure the amount of sperm males release in the
presence of females that vary in size and spawning history. They find that males release more
sperm in the presence of large females, but do not tailor their sperm expenditure in relation to
the number of times a female has spawned.
I think that the approach used in this study is very compelling, and researchers studying both
sexual selection and salmonid mating systems would be interested in the results of this study.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your helpful comments and criticisms of our manuscript. We
have carefully revised our manuscript as per the reviewer’s suggestions. The detailed
changes are described below.
One of my main concerns about this manuscript is the clarity of the methods. I had a very
difficult time understanding what was done and when. I think that this section should be
re-written, and I hope that my specific comments below offer some suggestions about how this
could be achieved. For example, I think this would be much easier to read if the vibration
measures section was placed after the description of the experiments and if the sperm collection
surgery were placed at the beginning of the methods (close to the ‘Data logger attachment’
section, given that it was done at the same time).
RESPONSE: Our apologizes for the lack of the clarity in the original method section. We
have now re-written this method section based on the reviewer’s comments and we have
improved clarity and detailed information.
I was initially not entirely certain about what the objective of the first described experiment was
(section d) – was this simply to correlate sperm release with vibration measures?
RESPONSE: The reviewer is indeed correct that we simply aimed to describe the
correlation between amount of sperm released and vibration duration in that section.
I assume that it was, and the second experiment (section e) was done without directly measuring
sperm release but rather using the vibration data to estimate it. This needs to be much clearer.
RESPONSE: In order to be clearer in this passage to address the reviewer’s query, we have
now added the sentence ‘The second experiment was done without directly measuring
sperm release but rather using the vibration data to estimate it.’ (see Lines 212-213).
My second concern is with the design of the experiment, and the conclusions that can be drawn
from it. The authors claim that males allocate sperm release to account for female size. While
they did find a relationship between sperm volume and female size, the degree to which this
reflects a male ‘decision’ in the absence of other females cannot be answered in this study. To do
so, males would need to be exposed to different females, which I understand was not the case
here.
RESPONSE: Our first objective of this study is to determine whether males allocate their
sperm according the female size (presumed to be a proxy for quality) or not. However,
male sperm allocation is not only driven by the presence of other females, but also the
speed of sperm production (in terms of duration between sperm releases). We understand
that the present experimental design does not address these issues, which are metrics we
intend to examine in detail in future studies. We believe that despite the fact there was
only one male and one female the results are important for examining sperm allocation by
males that often come across females in a sequential manner in the wild.
Finally, it would be extremely important to indicate the degree to which sperm depletion is an
issue in this species. At first glance, it seems that 30-40ul of sperm is not a large volume, and I
wonder if it is possible for males to deplete their sperm reserves without replenishment if the
volume released at a given spawning event is relatively low. Furthermore, is there an
information available regarding how quickly a male may replenish his sperm?
RESPONSE: We agree with the reviewer that sperm depletion could be an important
metric to understand in relation to reproductive success for salmon. However, there are no
data we are aware of for sperm replenishment dynamics in salmonids. This is something
we would like to examine in the future.
Introduction
Line 66. Remove the word ‘the’ before ‘sperm allocation’
RESPONSE: As per the reviewer’s suggestion we have deleted the word ‘the’ before ‘sperm
allocation’.
Line 81. Perhaps this phrase should indicate that females guard their nests to avoid having their
eggs uncovered by other females (rather than buried).
RESPONSE: We have now modified this sentence to read “females guard their nests to
avoid having their eggs uncovered by other females (rather than buried).”. (see Lines
76-77)
Line 85. Remove the word ‘that’ from the sentence that ends on this line.
RESPONSE: As per the reviewer’s suggestion we have removed the word “that” from this
sentence.
Line 99. Perhaps change ‘proximate’ to ‘nearby’
RESPONSE: We have changed the term “proximate” to “nearby”.
Lines 105-106. I’m not certain that I understand the prediction pertaining to male preference of
relatively larger females; if it is of benefit for males to allocate sperm because of the benefits of
mating with large females, shouldn’t this be only in absolute terms? I am thinking here of
extremes in male size- would very large or very small males be expected to allocate sperm
differently in the presence of a particular female? I see after reading the entire manuscript that
relative size may be the only way for males to assess females given that they are only paired
with one, but this is still a curious prediction that requires a bit more detail for the reader.
RESPONSE: We found a strong relationship between the amount of sperm released and
relative female size, which suggests that the degree of sperm allocation is contingent on
male size (which seems in-line with the reviewer’s comment). We acknowledge that this is
a caveat of this study and as such we have added the text ‘in one male-one female situation’
at the of this sentence to make the point more clear (see Lines 100-101)..
Line 111. Briefly explain the difference between the sophisticated method used here and that of
Fitzpatrick and Liley.
RESPONSE: To attach the condom device, 8 to 10 stiches are made around the
abdominal cavity. This is the difference between our method and that of Fitzpatrick
and Liley. We have now added text indicating that ‘Specifically, to attach the condom
device, 8 to 10 stiches are made around the abdominal cavity.’. (see Lines 107)
Lines 118-120. It seems that the overall objective should be placed before the secondary
objectives.
RESPONSE: As per the reviewer’s suggestion we have now moved this sentence on the
overall objective before the secondary objectives (see Lines 110-115).
Methods
Lines 124-126. Indicate the number of fish each year.
RESPONSE: As per the reviewer’s suggestion we have now added the number of fish each
year.
Line 126. What does ‘fish were transported to an outdoor tank separately’ mean? Were sexes
kept separate or were they in small groups?
RESPONSE: We have clarified this sentence in the revised manuscript. We transported
fish to an outdoor tank and kept the two sexes separated until the experiment took place.
We have deleted the word “separately” from the original sentence.
Line 139. Define “LF” as fork length for readers who might not be familiar with this
terminology.
RESPONSE: We now define “LF” as fork length in this sentence in order to avoid any
issues with terminology.
Lines 144-147. The wording in these sentences is awkward. Perhaps revise.
RESPONSE: We have revised this sentence as “To measure the vibration duration at
sperm release, we measured both swaying and surging acceleration data retrieved from
tagged fish. The acceleration data loggers measured both dynamic acceleration
(contractions of trunk muscular activity) and static acceleration along the body axis
(gravity or pitch). To separate these values, a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) filter
with Igor Pro (WaveMetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR, USA) and Ethographer software [35]
was used to extract the information on body vibration at gamete release from swaying
acceleration and pitch from surging acceleration, respectively. Duration of gamete release
of males was defined as duration of body vibration when oviposition in the swaying
acceleration (Fig 1). Convulsive contractions of trunk muscular activity corresponds to
gamete release, as has been revealed by studies using electromyogram recordings [33, 36,
37].” (see Lines 117-116)
Line 151. Should the ‘vs’ be taken out of this header?
RESPONSE: As per the reviewer’s suggestion we have now deleted the ‘vs’ from this line.
Lines 166-168. Were these fish used across different years or within a particular year?
RESPONSE: We conducted this experiment in 2012. So, we have now added ‘in 2012’ in
this sentence.LL
Lines 168-169. Were all fish in the channel at the same time? I suspect not because it is rather
small. Please clarify this, and explain the design to the reader.
RESPONSE: In order to be more clear as per the reviewer’s comment, we have now added
an explanation for this prior to this sentence; ‘One male fitted with a condom to collect the
ejaculate and the acceleration data logger and one gravid female were moved to the
spawning channel. Once spawning behaviour was observed, we removed the male fish
from the channel to collect the ejaculate and attached a new condom on the same fish.’.
(see Lines 202-206)
Line 181. Define ‘FA’ for the reader.
RESPONSE: As per the reviewer’s suggestion we have now added the explanation of FA as
‘eugenol; Tanabe Seiyaku Co. Ltd, Osaka, Japan’.
Line 190. Was this milt collected from the males in the experiment, and if so, how long
beforehand?
RESPONSE: Yes, this milt was collected from the males in the experiment. We measured
the absorbance immediately after the collection.
Lines 169-207. Perhaps this should be in a different section and placed prior to the experimental
information. It represents an interesting approach used in the study and should stand out for the
reader.
REVISION: Based on this comment we have now added a new section for this part as ‘(e)
Collection of milt’.
Line 204. Remove the word ‘the’ before ‘amount’.
RESPONSE: We have now deleted the word ‘the’ from this sentence.
Lines 216-217. Indicate here how these were spread across years (if this was the case).
RESPONSE: The variation in body size of fish used was not large across years. For
example, male fork length is 621.1 ± 26.3 mm in 2011, 596.6 ± 15.1 mm in 2012 and 627.6 ±
13.9 mm in 2013. We have now added this sentence in line 220-222.
Line 235. Remove the words ‘shown a’ from this sentence.
RESPONSE: We have now deleted the words ‘shown a’ from this sentence.
Line 243. My reading of the Results indicates that this was not a null model, but rather a
simplified one to examine the effect of a particular factor, which is sometimes the null model if
only one factor is being examined (at least I hope this is the case).
RESPONSE: Based on the reviewer’s comments we have now revised this word ‘as reduced
model"’. This part was my mistake, because we used a likelihood ratio test to compare
models between reduced models (sometimes null model). Therefore, the word “reduced
model” is correct here.
Results
Line 249. Clarify here for the reader that this is referring to the experiment using 8 males and 9
females.
RESPONSE: In the experiment, we changed a female between the first and second
oviposition for a male, therefore there was a difference in number of fish we used between
sexes. To make it more clear we have now added a sentence to this effect (see Lines X-Y).
Line 258. Change the wording for the sentence that begins on this line. Perhaps something more
like “Male fork length and mating number…’.
RESPONSE: We deleted the word ‘the’ after ‘mating number’ as per the reviewer’s
suggestion.
Line 272. Wasn’t male fork length used to estimate the amount of sperm released (as described
in section a) of the Results)?
RESPONSE: We partly used male fork length as a parameter to estimate the amount of
sperm released. However, no correlation between the amount of sperm released and male
fork length indicate that a model including male fork length as a parameter is not enough
to estimate the amount of sperm released.
Line 274. Please make it VERY clear to the reader that vibration duration here is for the female.
RESPONSE: We deleted the vibration duration for female in this sentence and table 2
because it may not make sense. At the start of this study, we expected the vibration
duration at egg release represent number of egg released, but there was no relationship
between them.
Line 279. Remove the word ‘the’ at the end of this line.
RESPONSE: We have removed the word ‘the’ at the end of this line.
Line 288. Change the word ‘correlation’ to ‘relationship’.
RESPONSE: We have changed the word ‘correlation’ to ‘relationship’ in this line as per
the reviewer’s suggestion.
Line 289. Is the number of eggs a total count or eggs per spawning?
RESPONSE: The number of eggs is per spawning and we have added text to clarify this
point (see Lines 290-291).
Lines 297-299. This result does not relate to the previous sentence.
RESPONSE: Our apologies for the lack of clarity in our original manuscript. We have now
revised this sentence to read ‘A generalized linear mixed model found that there was a
significant positive correlation between log transformed numbers of eggs and female fork
length in each mating event number (Fig S5)’. (see Lines 299-301)
Table 1. The word ‘correlation’ should be replaced in this caption. These models are based in
regression.
RESPONSE: We have replaced the word ‘correlation’ to ‘relationships’ in this caption as
per the reviewer’s suggestion.
Table 2. There are typographical errors in the word ‘event’ in the last two rows.
RESPONSE: Our apologies for the typographical errors in our original table caption. We
have now modified these words.
Discussion
Line 306. Female fecundity and egg number are the same thing (as far as I know). Perhaps
re-word this as the ‘In addition’ may make the reader think otherwise.
RESPONSE: We agree with the reviewer that these terms are the same. In order to be
more clear we have reworded this ‘also’ in this sentence.
Line 338. Did egg quality decrease over successive spawning events?
RESPONSE: We could not assess this issue because we did not check the egg quality over
successive spawning events. As such, to be more clear we have now deleted the ‘egg quality
and’ from this sentence to be more accurate.

Response for the Reviewer #2:
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have done a good job of improving the clarity of the manuscript, particularly the
Methods section. I have only a few minor comments related to the revised version.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your helpful comments of our manuscript. We have carefully
revised our manuscript as per your suggestions. The detailed changes to the manuscript are
described below.
1. On lines 199-200: there is a comment here that indicates that the condom procedure is described
below, but in this version is described above.
RESPONSE: We have changed the term “below” to “above”.
2. After reading this version, I think that the methods should be re-arranged slightly such that
section b about fish collection appears before section a about the attachment of the ejaculate
collection device.
RESPONSE: We have moved the section about fish collection before the section about the
attachment of the ejaculate collection device.
3. In my version, figures 1 and 2 are reversed.
RESPONSE: We have changed figure1 and figure 2 correctly.
Additionally, we found that figure indication was not correct in line 292, 294 and 298.
We have changed the term ‘Figure S5’ to ‘Fig 4a’ in line 292, ‘Fig S5b and S5c’ to ‘Fig 4b
and 4c’ and ‘Fig S6’ to ‘Fig 5’.
