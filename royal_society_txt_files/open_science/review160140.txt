Authors study whether textual properties of scientific papers relate to the number of citations
they receive. Several interesting results are reported, for example that correlations are non-linear,
and that they differ between most-cited and average papers. Most importantly, the biggest
predictors appear to be the legth and complexity of the abstract and the number of authors.
Altogether, I have very much enjoyed reading this manuscript, and it is my opinion that it is a
good work that is worth publishing in an interdisciplinary journal like Royal Society Open
Science. A minor revision along the following comments should nevertheless be considered.
1) In the abstract, please state how the length and complexity of the abstract and the number of
authors affect the number of citations (the more the better or vice versa). It would be very nice to
learn just then, but the readers is left wondering.
2) In reference to the evolution of science, recent works on physics in particular, namely Scientific
Reports 3, 1720 (2013) and Nature Physics 11, 791-796 (2015) also seems to be relevant.
3) Section b of the Methods is a bit vague towards the end. The reader is left wondering why
Gunning fog index is used and why "Because of the absence of sentences fog index has not been
calculated in case of title."?

This article by Sienkiewicz et al. [RSOS-160140] brings clarity to the discussion, albeit nuanced, on
the impact of lexical factors on the long-term citation of scientific papers. The language is clear,
the methods are well-documented and appropriate for the data and their scientific question, and
their results are organized in a clear fashion. I solidly recommend the article for publication,
providing just a few suggestions for clarity and improvement below.
First, in Eq. 4.4 the authors might consider standardizing the variable within year and journal.
This will further address the censoring bias associated with pooling publications from different
years together. The authors have partially accounted for this by only considering publications
that are at least 10 years old (in 2014). For more on this standardization approach, see Petersen &
Penner, EPJ Data Science 3, 24 (2014).
Second, I was expecting a bit more discussion about the impact of valence — especially since it is
highlighted in Fig. 1 and 3. Perhaps Footnote 3 merits being included in the text.
Third, in the case of significant coefficients for title and abstract words — how big is the effect in
terms of actual citations? For the particular case of the title, where there was much publicity
about how papers with shorter titles are cited more, are we talking 0.1 citation, 1 citation or 5
citations for every decrease in words? I am not sure this has been specified in the previous
literature, and it would be nice to know in real terms how big this effect is — for example at the
low, half, and top thresholds for the various length and sentiment factors.
And finally, on page 9 of 12, the statement “in the case of abstract and the first one” is unclear.
Also, consider adding a subscript to the quantities in Eqs. 4.1-4.3 to indicate that they are paper-
level indicators (ie in 4.4 you use subscript “i”).

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS OF THE MANUSCRIPT RSOS-160140
REVIEWER 1
1) In the abstract, please state how the length and complexity of the abstract and the
mber of authors a<U+FB00>ect the number of citations (the more the better or vice versa). It
uld be very nice to learn just then, but the readers is left wondering.
he required text has now been included in the abstract informing on positive correlations
all the mentioned predictors with the number of citations.
2) In reference to the evolution of science, recent works on physics in particular, namely
entific Reports 3, 1720 (2013) and Nature Physics 11, 791-796 (2015) also seems to be
vant.
he mentioned references have been added to the manuscript as [4] and [5].
3) Section b of the Methods is a bit vague towards the end. The reader is left wondering
y Gunning fog index is used and why “Because of the absence of sentences fog index has
been calculated in case of title.”?
We have now clarified the reasons why Gunning fog index had been used (straightforward
erpretation). Moreover we have elaborated the reasons why we consider it inappropriate
handling title complexity.

irst, in Eq. 4.4 the authors might consider standardizing the variable within year and
rnal. This will further address the censoring bias associated with pooling publications
m di<U+FB00>erent years together. The authors have partially accounted for this by only consid-
g publications that are at least 10 years old (in 2014). For more on this standardization
roach, see Petersen & Penner, EPJ Data Science 3, 24 (2014).
We are thankful for drawing our attention to this interesting paper of Petersen & Penner.
wever we would like to underline that the normalization procedure performed in the men-
ned study (specifically Eq. (1)) concerns the number of citations. In our case the variable
t is subject to being normalized is the feature of the paper (e.g., number of words etc.). As
re is little variability of those variables across the years and significant one with respect
di<U+FB00>erent journals we had considered it important to perform journal-wise normalization
given in Eq. (4.4).
econd, I was expecting a bit more discussion about the impact of valence especially since
s highlighted in Fig. 1 and 3. Perhaps Footnote 3 merits being included in the text.
ootnote contents have been now moved to the main text.
hird, in the case of significant coe<U+FB03>cients for title and abstract words how big is the
ct in terms of actual citations? For the particular case of the title, where there was much
licity about how papers with shorter titles are cited more, are we talking 0.1 citation, 1
tion or 5 citations for every decrease in words? I am not sure this has been specified in
previous literature, and it would be nice to know in real terms how big this e<U+FB00>ect is for
mple at the low, half, and top thresholds for the various length and sentiment factors.
hank you for these suggestions, we now address the mentioned issue in two places in our
dified manuscript: first in the “Strength of factors” paragraph and then in the “Discussion
Conclusion” section. In both cases we state that the observed e<U+FB00>ect is rather weak as
typical regression coe<U+FB03>cients are much lower than 0.69 which would e<U+FB00>ect in doubling
number of citations while moving one standard deviation along the normalized value of
variable. We have been reluctant to show the specific values of e.g., number of words as
y vary across di<U+FB00>erent journals. Instead the reader can easily compare beta coe<U+FB03>cient for
e length and valence in abstract using data shown in Figure 3. However to facilitate the
parison we have include a precise description at the end of “Variability across journals”
agraph.
nd finally, on page 9 of 12, the statement “in the case of abstract and the first one” is
lear. Also, consider adding a subscript to the quantities in Eqs. 4.1-4.3 to indicate that
y are paper-level indicators (i.e., in 4.4 you use subscript i).
We are thankful for these suggestions. The required changes have now been introduced in
corresponding Section.
