Comments to the Author:
Reviewer 2 has suggested that there is possible text overlap in the manuscript with other
published works. Both the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Chemistry are members of
COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics) and our ethical publishing policies align with their best
practice standards.
We therefore contacted the reviewer and they have provided additional comments as follows:
"In this manuscript I think the authors should rewrite the introduction, in particularly the first
part " Esterification, one of the most important reactions in organic synthesis, is widely used in
perfumes, plasticizers, solvents and other chemical products [1]. With economic development;
stricter requirements have been imposed on the industrial production of ester products. The
traditional esterification reaction using concentrated sulfuric acid as strong acid catalyst leads to
such issues as strong corrosiveness, difficult treatment of waste liquor, and many side reactions
[2-3]. Many kinds of heteropoly acids studied later as catalysts also result in such problems as
low catalytic efficiency, volatility, and difficulty in recovery [4]. However, the traditional
supported acid catalysts have such problems as low selectivity, low catalytic activity and harsh
reaction conditions [5]. In recent years, functionalized ionic liquids as new solvents and catalysts
have met the requirements of "green chemistry" and are easy to recover. These ionic liquids are
widely used in catalytic reactions, separation engineering and electrochemistry, and because of
their unique catalytic properties, they have attracted increasing attention [6].""
We ask you to consider re-wording the abstract, introduction and conclusions to take this into
account.

Response: Thanks associate editor for pointing this out. We have rewritten the

references [2], [3], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [12] as follows:
Summary
Four kinds of functional ionic liquids ([C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4, [C3SO3Hnmp]H2PO4,
[C3SO3Hnmp]CH3SO3H, [C3SO3Hnmp]C6H6SO3H) were prepared and the catalytic
activity of these ILs during esterification of carboxylic acids (formic acid, acetic acid,
propionic acid, butyric acid) with alcohols were investigated. The results indicated
that the ionic liquid ([C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4) exhibited an optimal catalytic performance.
And then the IL ([C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4) was immobilized to the silica gel. The
immobilized ionic liquid performed more excellent catalytic activity than the
unsupported [C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4. The effects of reaction temperature, reaction time,
molar ratio of acid to alcohol and catalyst dosage were investigated. The response
surface methodology (RSM) based on the Box-Behnken design (BBD) was utilized to
explore the best reaction condition of different experimental variables. Accordingly, a
high n-butyl butyrate yield of 97.10% under the deduced optimal reaction conditions
was obtained, in good agreement with experimental results and that predicted by the
BBD model. The immobilized ionic liquid [C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4 maintained high
catalytic activity after 5 cycles.
Introduction
As an important fine organic chemicals product, carboxylic esters have been widely
used in perfume, coating, pharmaceutical intermediates, cosmetics, tobacco and other
fields [1]. The main methods to obtain carboxylic esters are extraction of natural
substances and chemical synthesis [2-3]. The method of extracting carboxylic ester
from natural substance has the disadvantages of complex process, low purity and high
production cost. Therefore, the chemical synthesis method was extensively used to
prepare carboxylic esters. And the esterification of alcohols and carboxylic acids
became fundamental and important reactions in chemical synthesis. Conventionally,
chemical syntheses of carboxylic esters mostly invoke homogeneous catalysts, such
as sulphuric acid, p-toluene sulfonic acid, and phosphoric acid etc. And using these
high concentrated strong acids as catalyst leads to several problems such as equipment
corrosion, environmental pollution, undesirable side reactions, and catalyst
unrecyclable [4-5]. To avoid these weaknesses, solid super acids, such as heteropoly
acids, strong-acid ion exchange resin, zeolites, and enzymes have been employed for
esterification [6-9]. However, acid catalysts also have some problems such as low
selectivity and catalytic activity, easy deactivation, formidable separation and
unrecyclable and so on [10-11].
Ionic liquids (ILs), as new environmental benign catalysts, which were used to replace
conventional catalyst, are widely used in various organic synthesis, separation
engineering and electrochemistry owing to their unique characteristics such as
adjustable properties, designable structure, low melting point, high thermal stability,
negligible volatility, recyclability, and reusability [12-13]. With further research, the
immobilized ionic liquids, which were prepared by grafting ionic liquid onto silica gel,
molecular sieve, mesoporous nanomaterials and other carriers, can improve the
stability and higher catalytic activity in various chemical reactions such as Michael
addition, alkylation, epoxidation, Friedle-Crafts, and Heck catalytic hydrogenation
[14-17]. Herein, we synthesis four kinds of functional ionic liquids (1-(3-sulfopropyl)
-1-methylpyrrolidone sulfate [C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4,
1-(3-sulfopropyl)-1-methylpyrrolidone phosphate [C3SO3Hnmp]H2PO4
1-(3-sulfopropyl)-1-methylpyrrolidone p-toluene sulfonate [C3SO3Hnmp]CH3SO3H,
and 1-(3-sulfopropyl)-1-methylpyrrolidone methyl sulfonate
[C3SO3Hnmp]C6H6SO3H ), and were used to catalyze the synthesis of n-butyl
carboxylate. The ionic liquid[C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4 was immobilized onto silica gel,
and the immobilized ionic liquid [C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4 was applied to the catalytic
synthesis of n-butyl butyrate for the first time. The relevant reaction conditions
obtained during the synthesis of n-butyl butyrate were optimized using RSM.
Moreover, the immobilized ionic liquid was reused by a simple separating process,
and the catalytic activity of reused immobilized ionic liquid was also investigated.
Conclusion
In this paper, a series of Brønsted acidic ionic liquids were synthesized and exploited
to catalyse esterification of butyric acid and butyl alcohol. The ionic liquid
[C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4 has the best catalytic activity and the highest yield of n-butyl
butyrate. So the ionic liquid [C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4 was selected to be immobilized
using the sol-gel method. With the optimal esterification conditions: a molar ratio of
acid to alcohol of 1.2:1, a reaction temperature of 110<U+2103>, and a catalyst dosage of 5%
of n-butanol, a maximum n-butyl butyrate yield of 97.10% was obtained catalysed by
the immobilized ionic liquid [C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4. This result is consistent with the
prediction of the response surface optimization based on the BBD model. Using
immobilized ionic liquid [C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4 as catalyst can avoid the mutual
dissolution of the catalyst and the solvent, and provid a larger specific surface area,
which leading to a significant increasing of the yield of n-butyl butyrate. The yield of
n-butyl butyrate remained above 96% after reusing the supported ionic liquid
[C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4 5 times, demonstrating good reusability.

Response to comments of reviewers 1
1. Page 1, lines 27-31: The sentence is very difficult to be understood. Which is the
subject of the article needs to be clearly explained. Too tedious in current form.
Response: Thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and the suggestion is of great
importance. We have rewritten the abstract seriously, and the revised abstract is as
follows: (Page 1, lines 3-12)
Four kinds of functional ionic liquids ([C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4, [C3SO3Hnmp]H2PO4,
[C3SO3Hnmp]CH3SO3H, [C3SO3Hnmp]C6H6SO3H) were prepared and the catalytic
activity of these ILs during esterification of carboxylic acids (formic acid, acetic acid,
propionic acid, butyric acid) with alcohols were investigated. The results indicated
that the ionic liquid [C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4 exhibited an optimal catalytic performance.
And then ionic liquid ([C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4) was immobilized to the silica gel. The
immobilized ionic liquid performed better catalytic activity than the unsupported
[C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4. The effects of reaction temperature, reaction time, molar ratio of
acid to alcohol and catalyst dosage were investigated. The response surface
methodology (RSM) based on the Box-Behnken design (BBD) was utilized to explore

model. The immobilized ionic liquid [C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4 maintained high catalytic
activity after 5 cycles.
2. Page 1, lines 42-43: please replace “studied” for “were studied”.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s careful work. We are very sorry for our
incorrect writing,we have checked and corrected.
3. Page 2, lines 23: please replace “three flasks” to “three-necked flask”. Similar
mistakes should be carefully checked.
Response: Thanks for reviewer’s careful work. We have corrected all “three flasks””
to “three-necked flask”. (Page 2, lines 29-30)
4. Page 2, lines 21-30: How do you determine the purity of the products? The
differences of the yields were not large (83%-96.8%), but the accuracy of the yield
has a great influence on the establishment of the model.
Response: Thanks for reviewer pointing this out. Just as the reviewer’s suggestion,
the purity of the products has a great influence on the accuracy of the yield, and also
has an influence on the establishment of the model. In our work, we have noticed this
problem, and we have purified the product. The purity of the refined product was
analyzed by gas chromatography. The purification process is as follows:
After the reaction, the product (n-butyl butyrate as an example) can be the separated
directly from the reaction system. After separated, dropping sodium bicarbonate into
the product until the acid base of product is neutral, and then the product was washed
by distilled water. Then adding saturated calcium chloride solution and saturated
magnesium sulfate solution to the product successively to remove ethanol, other
possible substances and water. Finally, the product was vacuum dried and analyzed by
gas chromatography. The gas chromatogram showed that the purity of the product was
almost 99%.
Fig. 1 Gas chromatography of product (n-butyl butyrate)
5. Page 8, lines 46-50: Is any catalyst weight loss detected during the recycling
processes?
Response:Thank the reviewer for serious work. In our work, the catalyst has a small
amount of inevitable loss in the process of recycling. When the catalyst was reused
for 5 times, there was a nearly 4% mass loss of catalyst.
Response to comments of reviewers 2:
1. The manuscript (ID: RSOS-190166), titled “Catalytic Synthesis of N-Butyl
Carboxylate with Immobilized Ionic Liquid Based on RSM Optimization” details a
catalytic methodology towards the synthesis of several esters. The reaction scope was
evaluated as well as several other aspects such as reaction temperature, reaction time,
reutilization of the catalyst system, etc... The results are interesting and probably will
interest several researches. However, in my opinion the authors should rewrite the
abstract, introduction and conclusions because I detect plagiarism in those parts.
I do think that experimental section and/or discussion can have similar descriptions
but in the other parts the authors should be innovative.
Response:Thanks for reviewer’s suggestion. We are very sorry that some of the
descriptions in our paper are similar to other literatures. We have rewritten the
abstract, introduction and conclusions and altered carefully, and also added some
references [2], [3], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [12] as follows:
Summary
Four kinds of functional ionic liquids ([C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4, [C3SO3Hnmp]H2PO4,
[C3SO3Hnmp]CH3SO3H, [C3SO3Hnmp]C6H6SO3H) were prepared and the catalytic
activity of these ILs during esterification of carboxylic acids (formic acid, acetic acid,
propionic acid, butyric acid) with alcohols were investigated. The results indicated
that the ionic liquid ([C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4) exhibited an optimal catalytic performance.
And then the IL ([C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4) was immobilized to the silica gel. The
immobilized ionic liquid performed more excellent catalytic activity than the
unsupported [C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4. The effects of reaction temperature, reaction time,
molar ratio of acid to alcohol and catalyst dosage were investigated. The response
surface methodology (RSM) based on the Box-Behnken design (BBD) was utilized to
explore the best reaction condition of different experimental variables. Accordingly, a
high n-butyl butyrate yield of 97.10% under the deduced optimal reaction conditions
was obtained, in good agreement with experimental results and that predicted by the
BBD model. The immobilized ionic liquid [C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4 maintained high
catalytic activity after 5 cycles.
Introduction
As an important fine organic chemicals product, carboxylic esters have been widely
used in perfume, coating, pharmaceutical intermediates, cosmetics, tobacco and other
fields [1]. The main methods to obtain carboxylic esters are extraction of natural
substances and chemical synthesis [2-3]. The method of extracting carboxylic ester
from natural substance has the disadvantages of complex process, low purity and high
production cost. Therefore, the chemical synthesis method was extensively used to
prepare carboxylic esters. And the esterification of alcohols and carboxylic acids
became fundamental and important reactions in chemical synthesis. Conventionally,
chemical syntheses of carboxylic esters mostly invoke homogeneous catalysts, such
as sulphuric acid, p-toluene sulfonic acid, and phosphoric acid etc. And using these
high concentrated strong acids as catalyst leads to several problems such as equipment
corrosion, environmental pollution, undesirable side reactions, and catalyst
unrecyclable [4-5]. To avoid these weaknesses, solid super acids, such as heteropoly
acids, strong-acid ion exchange resin, zeolites, and enzymes have been employed for
esterification [6-9]. However, acid catalysts also have some problems such as low
selectivity and catalytic activity, easy deactivation, formidable separation and
unrecyclable and so on [10-11].
Ionic liquids (ILs), as new environmental benign catalysts, which were used to replace
conventional catalyst, are widely used in various organic synthesis, separation
engineering and electrochemistry owing to their unique characteristics such as
adjustable properties, designable structure, low melting point, high thermal stability,
negligible volatility, recyclability, and reusability [12-13]. With further research, the
immobilized ionic liquids, which were prepared by grafting ionic liquid onto silica gel,
molecular sieve, mesoporous nanomaterials and other carriers, can improve the
stability and higher catalytic activity in various chemical reactions such as Michael
addition, alkylation, epoxidation, Friedle-Crafts, and Heck catalytic hydrogenation
[14-17]. Herein, we synthesis four kinds of functional ionic liquids (1-(3-sulfopropyl)
-1-methylpyrrolidone sulfate [C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4,
1-(3-sulfopropyl)-1-methylpyrrolidone phosphate [C3SO3Hnmp]H2PO4
1-(3-sulfopropyl)-1-methylpyrrolidone p-toluene sulfonate [C3SO3Hnmp]CH3SO3H,
and 1-(3-sulfopropyl)-1-methylpyrrolidone methyl sulfonate
[C3SO3Hnmp]C6H6SO3H ), and were used to catalyze the synthesis of n-butyl
carboxylate. The ionic liquid[C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4 was immobilized onto silica gel,
and the immobilized ionic liquid [C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4 was applied to the catalytic
synthesis of n-butyl butyrate for the first time. The relevant reaction conditions
obtained during the synthesis of n-butyl butyrate were optimized using RSM.
Moreover, the immobilized ionic liquid was reused by a simple separating process,
and the catalytic activity of reused immobilized ionic liquid was also investigated.
Conclusion
In this paper, a series of Brønsted acidic ionic liquids were synthesized and exploited
to catalyse esterification of butyric acid and butyl alcohol. The ionic liquid
[C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4 has the best catalytic activity and the highest yield of n-butyl
butyrate. So the ionic liquid [C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4 was selected to be immobilized
using the sol-gel method. With the optimal esterification conditions: a molar ratio of
acid to alcohol of 1.2:1, a reaction temperature of 110<U+2103>, and a catalyst dosage of 5%
of n-butanol, a maximum n-butyl butyrate yield of 97.10% was obtained catalysed by
the immobilized ionic liquid [C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4. This result is consistent with the
prediction of the response surface optimization based on the BBD model. Using
immobilized ionic liquid [C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4 as catalyst can avoid the mutual
dissolution of the catalyst and the solvent, and provid a larger specific surface area,
which leading to a significant increasing of the yield of n-butyl butyrate. The yield of
n-butyl butyrate remained above 96% after reusing the supported ionic liquid
[C3SO3Hnmp]HSO4 5 times, demonstrating good reusability.
