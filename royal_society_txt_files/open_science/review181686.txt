The author have presented an interesting work on multilayer film of Al/Cux synthesized by a
classical route. The work is plausible and useful. However, the major problem to me is the
language really needs to be polished, with the following point to be considered:
1. replace the full stop with comma after plug in the second line in abstract;
2. page 2, line 4 in the second paragraph, double check Al/Ni, it might be Al/NiO;

Review Report for RSOS-181686
General Comments:
This manuscript reported on the preparation and performance characterization of an electronic
initiator which is based on nanothermite multilayer film and electrode plug. The ignition ability
of electronic initiator with different thickness of energetic film was investigated and proved to be
3
with an improved safety and reliability. The idea of integrating nanothermite multilayer film and
electrode plug directly is interesting, simple and easy to implement. However, the reviewer has
some concerns as stated in specific comments. These issues should be clarified before the
manuscript could be considered for publication.
Specific Comments:
1. Section 3, the total thickness of nanothermite film was demonstrated to have little effect on heat
release on page 5. However, page 9, authors stated the “heat output distinctly increased as the
thickness raising”, which seems to be a contradiction. Please explain. Besides, most papers show
that the factor that affects the exothermic performance of multilayer energetic materials is the
modulation period. But here, much better ignition ability in the gap test can be achieved by
simply increasing the thickness of film. What’s the possible mechanism? It would be better to add
more in-depth discussion.
2. Introduction part, the authors used SCB as a comparative example. However, most of the cited
references have no relation with SCB, e.g. [14], [17], [18], [20], [23-28] etc. Please check.
3. Figure 1, is it possible to add magnified figures of one electrode plug with and without
nanothermite multilayer film, especially the area between electrodes, to see some details?
4. Section 2.2, the authors set the single layer thickness of Al film and CuO film were 100 nm
and 200 nm, but in Figure 2a, the two layers seem not to be twice in thickness.
5. Figure 2b, why is there no obvious layering in EDS mapping? In addition, there are several
unlabeled peaks in EDS plot.
6. Page 5, it seems the exothermic reaction after Al melting (660 C) contributes to heat release as
well. Hence, the statement that “heat output was caused by solid-solid reaction” is not
appropriate here.
7. Page 5, last sentence, the Figure SI 2 is voltage-current curve instead of DSC plots. Please check.
8. Page 6, the described Cu peaks (43.29, 50.43 and 74,13 degree) are not that obvious in the
product curve of Figure 4. Besides, what do the sharp peaks in the product curve at around 53
and 55 degree stand for?
9. Page 7, please define function time. Because from Figure 6, the flame root of the 8 µm-thick
sample was extinguished earlier than that of 4.58 µm-thick sample.
10. In order to highlight the advantages of Al/CuOX film, it is suggested to add the high-speed
camera ignition images of traditional electronic plug (optional).
11. Page 9, “Although three kinds of initiators can easily fire the B-KNO3 tablet when it was
intimately contacted with film, the ignition ability was much more differently.” The authors did
not provide related experimental data to support this sentence.
12. Page 9, last sentence, what does the “same condition” mean? Same contact or same gap
distance?
13. Why the authors think the Al/CuOx layer can improve the safety of initiator? From this
manuscript, the Al/ CuOx layer decreased the ignition voltage and it is possible to ignite even
the gap increased to over 20mm. Doesn’t it mean the initiator is less safe?
14. Two related papers should be included in the references: Journal of Materials Science 47, 1296-
1305, 2012; ACS applied materials & interfaces 6, 10497-10505, 2014.
15. A carefully examine of the English grammar, sentence patterns and phrases of the entire
manuscript sentence by sentence is sincerely recommended. E.g. the first sentence of Abstract
part is completely unclear.

Dear Editors and Reviewers,
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’comments concerning our manuscript entitled
“Gap initiation with 20.35 mm: an initiator integrating the Al/CuOx multilayer film and traditional
electronic plug to enhance the ignition ability” (ID RSOS-18168). Those comments are all
valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding
significance to our researches. We have studied comments carefully and have made correction
which we hope meet with approval. The main corrections in the paper and the responds to the
reviewer’s comments are as following.
Thanks for all the help.
Best wishes

Reviewer: 1
1. replace the full stop with comma after plug in the second line in abstract;
Response:
The sentence was revised.
2. page 2, line 4 in the second paragraph, double check Al/Ni, it might be Al/NiO;
Response:
It should be Al/NiO, and Al/Ni was deleted.
3. page 5 line 7, replace weekly with weak;
Response:
The sentence of “and the low temperature weak exothermic peak was not expected to play a main
role in the ignition process” was revised. The word of “weakly” was introduced to page 5 line 7,
“One weakly exothermic peak”
4. page 5 line 16, the statement on thickness effect is incorrect;
Response:
As we known, the modulation period and modulation ratio will influence the heat release of
nanothermite film. In this paper, three kinds of Al/CuOx multilayer film were the same
modulation period and modulation ratio, the only difference was thickness. The heat release
measured from DSC was the amount of heat of unit mass, it was no related to the thickness. In
addition, the results of DSC were calculated by software, but the integral area of heat release was
chosen manually, so the result will be different.
So, we think that the thickness of film has little effect on heat release.
5. page 6, line 4, replace was with were; a lot of grammar errors in this paragraph and beyond;
Response:
The grammar in this paragraph was double checked. And the English grammar, sentence patterns
and phrases of entire manuscript sentences were carefully checked.
Reviewer: 2
1. Section 3, the total thickness of nanothermite film was demonstrated to have little
effect on heat release on page 5. However, page 9, authors stated the “heat output distinctly
increased as the thickness raising”, which seems to be a contradiction. Please explain. Besides,
most papers show that the factor that affects the exothermic performance of multilayer energetic
materials is the modulation period. But here, much better ignition ability in the gap test can be
achieved by simply increasing the thickness of film. What’s the possible mechanism? It would be
better to add more in-depth discussion.
Response:
I think that it is not contradictory. The heat release measured from DSC was the amount heat of
unit mass, it is impacted on the modulation period and modulation ratio, and it is not related to the
thickness and the mass of multilayered Al/CuOx film. On the other hand, it is a constant value
when the structure of film is fixed. In page 9, the surface area of electrode plug is constant, and the
amount heat of Al/CuOx multilayer film of unit mass is constant, the heat output of Al/CuOx
multilayer film is only related to the quantity of Al/CuOx multilayer film. The quantity of film
should be increased as the thickness raising, the total heat output should be increased as the
thickness increasing.
2. Introduction part, the authors used SCB as a comparative example. However, most of
the cited references have no relation with SCB, e.g. [14], [17], [18], [20], [23-28] etc. Please
check.
Response:
These references were checked and deleted.
3. Figure 1, is it possible to add magnified figures of one electrode plug with and without
nanothermite multilayer film, especially the area between electrodes, to see some details?
Response:
The images of electrode plug were magnified 100 times, and shown in the Figure 1.
4. Section 2.2, the authors set the single layer thickness of Al film and CuO film
were 100 nm and 200 nm, but in Figure 2a, the two layers seem not to be twice in
thickness.
Response:
The thickness of CuO and Al film were measured by the Nano Measurer software, and the results
were shown in Table 1. The average thickness of CuO and Al film was 196.7 5nm and 101.18 nm,
respectively.

5. Figure 2b, why is there no obvious layering in EDS mapping? In addition, there are
several unlabeled peaks in EDS plot.
Response:
The layer structure of EDS mapping is not obvious, it may be caused to the low resolution of SEM.
The cross-section SEM image of Al/CuOx multilayer film was measured in Nanjing University of
Science and Technology, the EDS of Al/CuOx multilayer film was measured in our lab.
The unlabeled peaks are Au and Si. Au is from the layer deposited onto samples prior to the SEM
measurement in order to increase the electric conductivity, while Si signal is from the quartz
substrate.
6. Page 5, it seems the exothermic reaction after Al melting (660 C) contributes to heat
release as well. Hence, the statement that “heat output was caused by solid-solid reaction” is not
appropriate here.
Response:
The sentence of “which was caused by the solid-solid reaction of Al with CuO” was deleted
7. Page 5, last sentence, the Figure SI 2 is voltage-current curve instead of DSC plots.
Please check.
Response:
The DSC plots were replenished in the Figure SI 2.
8. Page 6, the described Cu peaks (43.29, 50.43 and 74.13 degree) are not that obvious in
the product curve of Figure 4. Besides, what do the sharp peaks in the product curve at around 53
and 55 degree stand for?
Response:
Yes,the product of Cu peaks are not obvious in the Figure 4, it may be attribute to the low
contents of Cu. It is hard to explain the peaks around 53 and 55 degree, although I have checked
many papers, they may be caused by the contamination during the process of preparing the XRD
sample. And I will continue to study what the peaks are and where they are come from.
I hope to delete the discussion about the production of multilayered Al/CuOx film,it is not the key
of this paper.
9. Page 7, please define function time. Because from Figure 6, the flame root of the 8
µm-thick sample was extinguished earlier than that of 4.58 µm-thick sample.
Response:
The function time is derived from SCB devices, it is calculated from the voltage-current plots, the
time that the current just pass the bridge wire is defined t0, and the time that the current kept
steady is defined t1. the function time is the difference between t1 and to , it is not observed by
high-speed camera. (Peng Zhu, et al., Characterization of Al/CuO nanoenergetic multilayer films
integrated with semiconductor bridge for initiator applications, Journal of Applied Physics, 2013,
113, 184505, doi: 10.1063/1.4804315 )
10. In order to highlight the advantages of Al/CuOX film, it is suggested to add the
high-speed camera ignition images of traditional electronic plug (optional).
Response:
The high-speed camera ignition images of traditional electronic plug are shown in Figure SI 4.
11. Page 9, “Although three kinds of initiators can easily fire the B-KNO3 tablet when it
was intimately contacted with film, the ignition ability was much more differently.” The authors
did not provide related experimental data to support this sentence.
Response:
The test results of three kinds of initiators with different thickness of Al/CuOX film were shown in
Table S2.
12. Page 9, last sentence, what does the “same condition” mean? Same contact or same gap
distance?
Response:
The same condition means that the electrode plug was contacted with B-KNO3 tablet. The
sentences of “The electrode plug without Al/CuOx multilayer film was also ignited under the
same condition” were replaced by“The electrode plug without Al/CuOx multilayer film was
tightly contacted to ignite the B-KNO3 tablet”.
13. Why the authors think the Al/CuOx layer can improve the safety of initiator? From this
manuscript, the Al/ CuOx layer decreased the ignition voltage and it is possible to ignite even the
gap increased to over 20mm. Doesn’t it mean the initiator is less safe?
Response:
It does not mean the initiator is less safe, because the Al/CuOx layer could avoid the bridge wire
contact with initiating explosive directly, especially for the extremely initiating explosive, such as
LTNR, LA. The low ignition voltage of Al/CuOx layer is benefit to the micro-ignition system and
the gap initiation ability of Al/CuOx layer is promised to improve safety in the In—Line Ignition
System.
14. Two related papers should be included in the references: Journal of Materials Science
47, 1296-1305, 2012; ACS applied materials & interfaces 6, 10497-10505, 2014.
Response:
The paper of “Journal of Materials Science 47, 1296-1305, 2012”was listed in the reference of 15.
The paper of “ACS applied materials & interfaces 6, 10497-10505, 2014”was listed in the
reference of 21.
15. A carefully examine of the English grammar, sentence patterns and phrases of the
entire manuscript sentence by sentence is sincerely recommended. E.g. the first sentence of
Abstract part is completely unclear.
Response:
The English grammar, sentence patterns and phrases of entire manuscript sentence were carefully
checked.

General Comments:
The revised manuscript has been significantly improved, especially the introduction
part. It can be considered for publication after the following minor issues being
modified.
Specific Comments:
1. Please correctly mark the labels in Figure 1 and 7.
Response: the labels were checked.
2. Page 6, is it better to move XRD result forward since there’s no data from product?
Response: It is not reasonable to move XRD result. So, we supplied the result in
Paper. About 1 gram Al/CuOx multilayer film was ignited in an enclosed vessel, and
the product of reaction was analyzed by XRD again, the plots of XRD were shown in
Figure 4.
3. Page 7, the authors are not sure about “the product Cu” according to last version of
manuscript, and there’s no evidence to prove Cu was eventually produced.
Response: The plots of XRD were shown in Figure 4, and the results were shown that
there was Cu in the product.
4. Please check the title of Figure SI 3.
Response: The title of Figure SI 3 was checked and corrected.
