This paper reports on the beneficial effect of modifying a Ni catalyst with a polymer (PVP). The
work is novel and the conclusions reported are supported by the data and analysis reported. I do
not see any major flaw and recommend publication after minor revisions:
Highlights:
- the term “ecological” is out of place here, it can be replaced with “waste-based material”. Same
comment applies in Section 1.
-one of the statement “small nickel particles” and “high Ni dispersion” is redundant. The same
comment applies to the Abstract.
Section 2.
The treatment with sulfuric acid, to remove metals from the recycled materials, may not be
considered as “green chemistry”. The waste stream needs to be disposed of. This moderate the
“ecologic” aspect of the process.
Page 11, Fig. 7: the band at 2350/cm correspond to ambient CO2, not Si-H stretching bands.
Page 13: the sentence “This was attributed to less agglomeration of nickel because of the smaller
particle size and higher dispersion of nickel.” appears meaningless: the latter part does not
explain the former, those are equivalent.
Page 16 and Fig. 13: the IR spectra apeear identical, both exhibiting bands at 3050/cm of
aromatics. These data needs to be analysed in more details and the paragraphs rewritten.
Table 3: Giving specific surface areas with six significant figures is probably overstating the
expected precision of the corresponding measure. Same for pore size.

REVIEW
A Ni-based catalyst with Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as a dispersant supported in a
pretreated fluid catalytic cracking (PFC3R) catalyst residue for C9 petroleum resin
hydrogenation
The manuscript under consideration deals with investigation of a new Ni catalyst for
petroleum resin hydrogenation. The article fairly agrees with the Journal topics.
Recently the number of research activities on different aspects of petroleum resin
modification is growing, including copolymerization, epoxidation, hydrogenation, etc. In this
regard the topicality of the research field is unmistakable. The results can be practical for
developing a new technology and a catalyst for polymer hydrogenation, that makes it possible to
state practical relevance of the work. The number of research papers on catalytic hydrogenation
of petroleum resins is not very large, metallic (Ni, Pt, Pd) catalysts are not widely investigated.
That is why the novelty of the proposed solutions can be pointed out.
The parts of the article are stated clearly and with the proper expansion. Scientific style
and terminology are quit perfect. Along with this, several remarks are to be drawn out, that
would help to improve the paper presented.
1. Page 9 – 200# solvent oil. The composition and the main properties (boiling range,
aromatics content) of the solvent should be described briefly.
2. The procedure for petroleum resin product separation from the solvent should be
described.
3. It may be interesting to determine molecular weight of petroleum resin and the product
in order to explain softening point decrease.
4. Hydrogenation degree is characterized by bromine value, that corresponds to double
bonds content. However, aromatic rings are hydrogenated, too. The fact is that aromatic rings are
hydrogenated not as rapidly, as olefins. The aromatics hydrogenation degree might better
characterize catalyst activity. So, it might be interesting to determine aromatic protons content
for all samples.
5. The catalyst support contains zeolite with high acidic properties. It may be desirable to
investigate effect of support on cracking reactions that result in molecular weight and softening
point deterioration.
6. One may recommend to present more information on petroleum resin hydrogenation
catalysts in Introduction part. Some patents may be mentioned, for example 6755963 (US),
5817900 (US), as well as papers (J. Chem. Tech. Biotechnol. 1992, 53, 365-371; Petroleum
Chemistry. 2018, 58, 48–55).
The remarks presented do not affect general high rating of the paper. After the minor
revision the manuscript can be accepted for publication.

Responses to the Editor’s comments:
Thank you very much for your effort in reviewing our manuscript. We appreciate
your professional attitude in the review of our study. We ensure all data is reported to
appropriate significant figures (precision) and that error boundaries (accuracy) have
been provided. The datasets supporting this article have been uploaded as part of the
electronic supplementary material. We have revised the paper carefully according to
your suggestions.
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer 1:
1. The reviewer's comment:
Highlights:
- the term “ecological” is out of place here, it can be replaced with “waste-based
material”. Same comment applies in Section 1.
-one of the statement “small nickel particles” and “high Ni dispersion” is redundant.
The same comment applies to the Abstract.
[Responses] Thank you for your suggestion.
“ecological” in Highlights and section 1 has been replaced with “waste-based
material”.
“high Ni dispersion” in Highlights and the Abstract has been deleted.
2. The reviewer's comment: Section 2. The treatment with sulfuric acid, to remove
metals from the recycled materials, may not be considered as “green chemistry”. The
waste stream needs to be disposed of. This moderate the “ecologic” aspect of the
process.
[Responses] Thank you for your comment.
We agree with the viewpoint of the reviewer. However, sulfuric acid played a quite
important role in pretreatment of the support in this work. Hydrogenation activity of
the catalyst was better after the treatment with sulfuric acid, which may be ascribed to
the larger specific surface area and pore volume. And according to the reviewer’s
comment, we will study more environmentally friendly pretreatment methods (e.g.,
suitable reaming agents, microwave treatment) in the future work.
3. The reviewer's comment: Page 11, Fig. 7: the band at 2350/cm correspond to
ambient CO2, not Si-H stretching bands.
[Responses] Thank you for your comment.
“the stretching vibration of Si–H” on page 12 in the revised manuscript has been
replaced with “ambient CO2”.
4. The reviewer's comment: Page 13: the sentence “This was attributed to less
agglomeration of nickel because of the smaller particle size and higher dispersion of
nickel.” appears meaningless: the latter part does not explain the former, those are
equivalent.
[Responses] Thank you for your comment.
“less agglomeration of nickel because of” on page 14 in the revised manuscript
has been deleted.
5. The reviewer's comment: Page 16 and Fig. 13: the IR spectra apeear identical,
both exhibiting bands at 3050/cm of aromatics. These data needs to be analysed in more
details and the paragraphs rewritten.
[Responses] Thank you for your comment.
FTIR measurements of C9 HPR and C9 PR were remeasured and illustrated in Fig.
13. Discussion have been rewritten. The detailed revision can be seen in section 3.4 on
page16 and in “References” (Refs 38-40) on page 23 in the revised manuscript.
6. The reviewer's comment: Table 3: Giving specific surface areas with six
significant figures is probably overstating the expected precision of the corresponding
measure. Same for pore size.
[Responses] Thank you for your comment.
We have rewritten specific surface areas, most probable pore sizes and total pore
volumes with reasonable significant figures in Table 3 in accordance with the
reviewer’s comment.
Reviewer #2:
1. The reviewer's comment: Page 9 – 200# solvent oil. The composition and the
main properties (boiling range, aromatics content) of the solvent should be described
briefly.
[Responses] Thank you for your suggestions.
We have added the composition and the main properties (boiling range, aromatics
content) of 200# solvent oil to our manuscript. The detailed revision can be seen in
section 2.1 on page 6 in the revised manuscript.
2. The reviewer's comment: The procedure for petroleum resin product separation
from the solvent should be described.
[Responses] Thank you for your suggestions.
We have added the procedure for petroleum resin product separation from the
solvent to our manuscript. The detailed revision can be seen in section 2.4 on page 9.
3. The reviewer's comment: It may be interesting to determine molecular weight of
petroleum resin and the product in order to explain softening point decrease.
[Responses] Thank you for your comment.
As suggested by the reviewer, we have determined molecular weight of petroleum
resin and the product by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The results are
illustrated in Table 4. The detailed revision can be seen in section 2.4 on page 9-10 and
in section 3.4 on page 17.
4. The reviewer's comment: Hydrogenation degree is characterized by bromine
value, that corresponds to double bonds content. However, aromatic rings are
hydrogenated, too. The fact is that aromatic rings are hydrogenated not as rapidly, as
olefins. The aromatics hydrogenation degree might better characterize catalyst activity.
So, it might be interesting to determine aromatic protons content for all samples.
[Responses] Thank you for your comment. Your suggestions are professional and
helpful.
Bromine number in C9 petroleum resin hydrogenation was used to discuss the
activity of Ni-PVP/PFC3R and compared with that of Ni/PFC3R in the original
manuscript. Previous experiments [L Yu, D Jiang, J Xu, L Ma, X Li. 2012. Two-Stage
Hydrogenation Modification of C9 Petroleum Resin over NiWS/<U+03B3>-Al2O3 and PdRu/<U+03B3>-Al2O3
Catalysts in Series. China Pet. Process. Pe. 14, 83-89.; C Wei, X Chen, J Xue, X Wei, J Liang, R
Liang, L Wang. 2016. A small eggshell Ni/SFC3R catalyst for C5 petroleum resin hydrogenation:
preparation and characterization. RSC Adv. 49113–49122.] that used bromine number as
indicators to discuss the preparation and performance of catalysts obtained satisfactory
results.
As suggested by the reviewer, it is interesting to determine aromatic protons
content for all samples, especially in the study of the hydrogenation reaction mechanism
of C9 petroleum resin, and this requires a lot of work. We are dedicating to this
meaningful work and the results will be discussed in our next paper. In addition, the
content of this manuscript (A Ni-based catalyst with Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as a
dispersant supported in a pretreated fluid catalytic cracking (PFC3R) catalyst residue
for C9 petroleum resin hydrogenation) has been complete and is too long.
5. The reviewer's comment: The catalyst support contains zeolite with high acidic
properties. It may be desirable to investigate effect of support on cracking reactions that
result in molecular weight and softening point deterioration.
[Responses] Thank you for your suggestions.
As suggested by the reviewer, we have discussed the effect of support on softening
point deterioration. Yu et al. and Lu et al. [L Yu, D Jiang, J Xu, L Ma, X Li. 2012. Two-Stage
Hydrogenation Modification of C9 Petroleum Resin over NiWS/<U+03B3>-Al2O3 and PdRu/<U+03B3>-Al2O3
Catalysts in Series. China Pet. Process. Pe. 14, 83-89.; J Lu, L Ma, D Jiang, C Lu, Q Zhang, X Li.
2011. Effect of <U+03B3>-Al2O3 Pore Structure on Activity of Supported Pd Catalysts in C9 Petroleum Resin
Hydrogenation. Petrochemical Technology (in Chinese). 40, 1105-1109.] have employed <U+03B3>-
Al2O3 as supports of catalysts for C9 petroleum resin hydrogenation. They found that
softening point decreased slightly by 4% after hydrogenation at the temperature of
275<U+2103>, and in our study, softening point decreased slightly by 6% with the PFC3R as
support after hydrogenation at the temperature of 270<U+2103>, which indicated that the
influence of the support on the decrease of the softening point is not significant. Yu et
al. have also discussed the influence of reaction temperature on softening point. Results
showed that high temperature will cause a certain decrease in softening point. Therefore,
we believe that temperature is the main factor that causes the decrease of softening
point.
We have added a discussion about the influence of the support on softening point
to make the manuscript more rigorous, the detailed revision can be seen in section 3.4
on page 16.
6. The reviewer's comment: One may recommend to present more information on
petroleum resin hydrogenation catalysts in Introduction part. Some patents may be
mentioned, for example 6755963 (US), 5817900 (US), as well as papers (J. Chem. Tech.
Biotechnol. 1992, 53, 365-371; Petroleum Chemistry. 2018, 58, 48–55).
[Responses] Thank you for your suggestions.

the detailed revision can be seen in “Introduction” on page 4 and in “References” (Refs
9-11) on page 19-20.

manuscript. These changes will not influence the content and frame work of the paper.
And here we did not list the changes but marked in red in revised manuscript.
We are very appreciated for the warm work of editor/reviewers, and hope the
correction will meet with approval.
Thanks again for your comment and suggestions, which make our manuscript
more rigorous and scientific.
