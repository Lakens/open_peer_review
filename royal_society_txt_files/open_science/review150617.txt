In my opinion the novel information provided by this article is relatively limited and I think that
it could be improved by summarizing more clearly (with a figure if possible) the differences
between the fiber-formation system in the different species and the differences in the webs, then
analyzing the possible relations. Furthermore, in my view "the model for cribellate thread
production" is not clearly described. Adding one schematic figure of the model and summarizing
the ideas exposed in the Results-discussion would be very helpful and I consider it mandatory.
My judgment is that the authors should improve the paper following this idea.
Finally, the text in the manuscript is clear but it needs some minor proofreading to improve the
grammar.

This study makes excellent contributions to the knowledge about morphological modifications
for the combing of spider cribellate silk into puffy structures with dry adhesive properties. The
extraction of quantitative data from still images and high speed videos, as well as the
manipulation of the calamistrum on a live spider with superglue to observe the effect on silk
processing were elegant and used to great effect in this study. This manuscript is likely to inspire
future investigations on the functional morphology of spider spinning structures.
My main issue with the manuscript is with the title and references throughout the text that
generalities about the cribellate spinning process have been made by studying three species of
cribellate spiders (two species in the Uloboridae and one species of Deinopidae). There are
3
numerous species of cribellate spiders and Uloboridae and Deinopidae do not represent the
extremes of cribellate spider diversity. In fact, Uloboridae and Deinopidae have traditionally
comprised the superfamily Deinopoidea. Recent phylogenomic analyses have suggested that
Deinopoidea may be paraphyletic, but still ally the two families. Regardless of the specifics of
spider phylogenetics, it is an overstatement to title this paper, “Morphological adaptation of the
calamistrum to the cribellate spinning process,” without any qualification. The title would better
match the research if it was, “Morphological adaptation of the calamistrum to the cribellate
spinning process of Deinopoidea (Uloboridae, Deinopidae),” or something similar that would
limit the taxonomic scope. Currently, the title promises more than it delivers because the authors
have not examined calamistrums from any other cribellate species outside of Deinopoidea. The
authors state in the Introduction that, “Between different species, the calamistrum morphology
can differ remarkably.” This is certainly true, and this paper should inspire research on cribellate
spiders beyond two Uloboridae (closely related to each other) and one Deinopidae
(phylogenetically close to Uloboridae). It isn't until the bottom half of page 16 that it is
mentioned that there are cribellate spiders other than Uloboridae and Deinopoidae, and the
diversity encompassed by the morphological, ecological, and phylogenetic diversity of
Amaurobiidae, Eresidae, Filistatidae, Hypochilidae, and Zorposidae is enormous (as well as other
cribellate families not mentioned).
Some of the wordings in this manuscript are rather odd. For example,
“We were able to proof the model valid in spiders with different shaped calamistra” (p. 7,
Abstract). What does “proof the model” mean? How can applying a model to two species
“prove” a model? Would it be more appropriate to state that the model was corroborated?
The non-standard word “bended” occurs twice on p. 11. “Tracing a setae to its tip, the setae
bended about …” “The setae also bended about …” I think the authors meant, “bend” or “were
bent”?
The “Conclusion” paragraph should be revised. Currently, each sentence has multiple
grammatical errors and thus the paper doesn't end as well as it should.

The authors present an extremely detailed and well-integrated account of cribellar thread
spinning events and morphology that is supported by excellent images and diagrams. The
techniques they use in conducting this study were very intricate and well executed. Some of
them, such as gluing calamistrum setae together were quite original and innovative and
produced very conclusive results. A very strong feature of the paper is its comprehensiveness
and ability to bring together morphological, behavioral, experimental, and modeling approaches
to reach solid conclusions.
I think that there are aspects of the paper’s presentation that can be improved to ensure that this
excellent study will get the full recognition that it deserves. The paper’s organization is good and
I didn’t have trouble following its flow and descriptions. However, I believe that the second half
of the abstract is too technical and some of it will make sense only after one has read the paper.
Therefore, it would be useful to rewrite the last half of the abstract to focus on the big ideas and
conclusions of the study and to present these more clearly. For example, clearly stating that the
paper provides conclusive evidence that the calamistrum does not comb out cribellar nano fibers
in the way that has long been thought. Instead the setae lock together to form a smooth transfer
surface that directs the flow of the cribellar sheet. I believe that other main conclusions can also
be described in broader, more easily understood ways in the abstract.
I didn’t have any difficulty in reading and understanding the paper, but I have marked some
places on the PDF copy where simple work substitution or rephrasing would make the text
clearer and allow it to flow better. There are other places that would also benefit from a little
improvement, which might be made with minor editing.

I think that the information in the article is better explained in this version. I think Figure 2 and
the other modifications facilitate the reading.
Also, the grammar has been improved.
Again, I recommend the publication of the paper, but I would like to propose to improve it in the
same sense that I said previously:
- Firstly, I would like to propose to modify figure 2. In my opinion it should explain the different
positions of the components of the system during each step of the production of the fiber (which
is explained in the introduction (I like the new version) and later). The figure could contain
different subfigures (a,b,c…) showing the geometry in each step (the position of the metatarsus,
fibers, spinnerets, etc in each step…). In my view this figure is important, because it is the
principal message of the article.
- Secondly, I think that a table summarizing the different features and behavior during the
spinning process, for the different species, is needed (because these differences cannot be shown
in figure 2). Without this summary, the reader would need to write notes along the test by
himself/herself... The summarizing table would provide rapidly this information. The table could
contain one row for each species and one column for each morphological
feature/angles/characteristic of the process.
Therefore, if the editor agrees, my recommendation is to publish the article after this minor
revision.

See Appendix B.
Appendix A
Reply to the referees:
We would like to thank the referees for their work and the constructive criticism which
helped us to improve the manuscript. Please find below a point by point response to all
concerns raised.
Reviewer: 1
In my opinion the novel information provided by this article is relatively limited and I think
that it could be improved by summarizing more clearly (with a figure if possible) the
differences between the fiber-formation system in the different species and the differences
in the webs, then analyzing the possible relations.
As suggested, we emphasized the differences between the species by including pictures of
the spider families during capture thread formation in Fig. 4 (now Fig. 5). We hope their
different behaviour is now better comprehendible.
Furthermore, we stated more clearly in the introduction, respectively in the discussion, that
threads and spinnerets (we suppose, that’s what you meant with “fibre formation system”)
are very similar (see e.g. Peters 1992, here [25]). We complemented these available data by
including Z. geniculata, for which no data was available in the literature so far.
Furthermore, in my view "the model for cribellate thread production" is not clearly
described. Adding one schematic figure of the model and summarizing the ideas exposed in
the Results-discussion would be very helpful and I consider it mandatory. My judgment is
that the authors should improve the paper following this idea.
Finally, the text in the manuscript is clear but it needs some minor proofreading to improve
the grammar.
As demanded we included a small explanatory figure in this paper here, summarizing the
model (new: Fig. 2). However, we kept this rather short as the description of the model is
given in details in another paper (here [7]) and is in the current manuscript transferred to
other species.
Reviewer: 2
This study makes excellent contributions to the knowledge about morphological
modifications for the combing of spider cribellate silk into puffy structures with dry
adhesive properties. The extraction of quantitative data from still images and high speed
videos, as well as the manipulation of the calamistrum on a live spider with superglue to
observe the effect on silk processing were elegant and used to great effect in this study.
This manuscript is likely to inspire future investigations on the functional morphology of
spider spinning structures.
Thank you very much! We do very much hope to inspire future investigations, as so little
research has been done on this fascinating topic of the cribellate thread production. Other
silk extraction systems might be inspired as well (as e.g. the investigation of the comb-hairs
in Pholcidae had inspired us).
My main issue with the manuscript is with the title and references throughout the text that
generalities about the cribellate spinning process have been made by studying three
species of cribellate spiders (two species in the Uloboridae and one species of Deinopidae).
There are numerous species of cribellate spiders and Uloboridae and Deinopidae do not
represent the extremes of cribellate spider diversity. In fact, Uloboridae and Deinopidae
have traditionally comprised the superfamily Deinopoidea. Recent phylogenomic analyses
have suggested that Deinopoidea may be paraphyletic, but still ally the two families.
Regardless of the specifics of spider phylogenetics, it is an overstatement to title this paper,
“Morphological adaptation of the calamistrum to the cribellate spinning process,” without
any qualification. The title would better match the research if it was, “Morphological
adaptation of the calamistrum to the cribellate spinning process of Deinopoidea
(Uloboridae, Deinopidae),” or something similar that would limit the taxonomic scope.
Currently, the title promises more than it delivers because the authors have not examined
calamistrums from any other cribellate species outside of Deinopoidea. The authors state in
the Introduction that, “Between different species, the calamistrum morphology can differ
remarkably.” This is certainly true, and this paper should inspire research on cribellate
spiders beyond two Uloboridae (closely related to each other) and one Deinopidae
(phylogenetically close to Uloboridae). It isn't until the bottom half of page 16 that it is
mentioned that there are cribellate spiders other than Uloboridae and Deinopoidae, and
the diversity encompassed by the morphological, ecological, and phylogenetic diversity of
Amaurobiidae, Eresidae, Filistatidae, Hypochilidae, and Zorposidae is enormous (as well as
other cribellate families not mentioned).
Your objection have been transferred to the manuscript and the title was revised.
Furthermore, within the introduction it is now clearly stated, that three close relatives are
compared (line 75-78). We never wanted to mislead the reader.
Some of the wordings in this manuscript are rather odd. For example,
“We were able to proof the model valid in spiders with different shaped calamistra” (p. 7,
Abstract). What does “proof the model” mean? How can applying a model to two species
“prove” a model? Would it be more appropriate to state that the model was corroborated?
It was changed to “We were able to transfer the model without restrictions to spiders with
different shaped calamistra”. We revised the manuscript in general, looking for wording
errors.
The non-standard word “bended” occurs twice on p. 11. “Tracing a setae to its tip, the
setae bended about …” “The setae also bended about …” I think the authors meant, “bend”
or “were bent”?
It was changed to “bend”.
The “Conclusion” paragraph should be revised. Currently, each sentence has multiple
grammatical errors and thus the paper doesn't end as well as it should.
The paragraph was revised. Thank you for the hint!

Comments to the Author(s)
I think that the information in the article is better explained in this version. I think Figure 2 and the
other modifications facilitate the reading.
Also, the grammar has been improved.
Again, I recommend the publication of the paper, but I would like to propose to improve it in the
same sense that I said previously:
- Firstly, I would like to propose to modify figure 2. In my opinion it should explain the different
positions of the components of the system during each step of the production of the fiber (which is
explained in the introduction (I like the new version) and later). The figure could contain different
subfigures (a,b,c…) showing the geometry in each step (the position of the metatarsus, fibers,
spinnerets, etc in each step…). In my view this figure is important, because it is the principal message
of the article.
- Secondly, I think that a table summarizing the different features and behavior during the spinning
process, for the different species, is needed (because these differences cannot be shown in figure 2).
Without this summary, the reader would need to write notes along the test by himself/herself... The
summarizing table would provide rapidly this information. The table could contain one row for each
species and one column for each morphological feature/angles/characteristic of the process.
Therefore, if the editor agrees, my recommendation is to publish the article after this minor revision.

Dear Reviewer 1,
We are very glad to hear you liked the corrected version of the manuscript! We are very
unfortunate, that our new Fig. 2 did not fulfill your expectations. I have redrawn the complete Fig. 2
and included now three different positions during the combing cycle. The according legend was of
course adapted to the new figure. We hope the context is now better understandable.
We very much liked the idea of a table, summing up the ideas of the result section. You find now the
according summary in Tab. 2 at the end of the result section.
Your grammar corrections were all incorporated in the text. Line 267-270 was shorted, as it was
mainly a repetition of the foregoing sentence and indeed confusing.
Thank you again for your efforts! They helped improving this manuscript.
Sincerely yours,
