label_comment_1
The authors describe a method of the sequential ligation from N to C direction by using one of
combinations of orthogonal ligation methods, TCL and NCL. TCL was developed by the authors
group, and this combination would be new, but in the title of this paper should contain some
information such as ligation methods. After that and other corrections described below, this
reviewer thinks that this paper is acceptable for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
The yield of peptide A, B, C, each intermediate and final product, and the reaction scale are
required to evaluate the efficiency of this method.
The authors describe that ‘The replacement of the Ala to Cys did not affect the structure of
monellin’ from its CD spectrum, but the spectrum without mutation is required to compare the
structure.
In the legends of figures, ‘MW calcd’ is shown. Are these theoretical or deconvoluted values.
These should be shown in same significant figures.
In references, the format is not unified. Please check them one by one carefully.

Hou et al reported their studies on combing thioacid capture ligation and native chemical ligation
to realize effective N to C sequential synthesis of protein chemical ligation. This concept was
further effectively demonstrated by the total synthesis of a sweet protein Monellin (96 amino
acids). The reported study was well executed and will find potential applications in protein
chemical synthesis. Thus it is suggested to be published. Here are some comments for the authors
to consider:
1) cite some recent other reports on N-to-C ligation via combing different chemical ligation
approaches
2) It will be easier for the readers if there is numbering on the MNEI protein sequence
3) Was cyclization observed when protecting the N-terminal Cys by Npys of peptide B thioester?
4) It will be nicer to provide the HPLC trace of the second ligation reaction.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
This manuscript written by Hou et al. demonstrated that a novel sequential ligation method with
N to C direction. The sequential ligation strategy is used worldwide in protein chemical
synthesis, and the concept shown in the manuscript seems to have enough novelty for
publication in Royal Society Open Science. However, this manuscript lacks the important data,
such as yields of synthetic peptides. Many ambiguous and incorrect descriptions are also found,
4
and therefore this manuscript at this stage is not acceptable for publication. This reviewer
recommends the authors to collect all data again and to rewrite the paper. Specific comments are
below.
1. In Abstract, the authors described “a sweet monellin was produced through this strategy with
full biological activity on a scale of multi-milligram”, but this description is completely incorrect.
The synthetic protein was not the intact monellin but a single-chain monellin analogue with a
mutation (Ala --> Cys); No description about the biological activity of synthetic protein was
found in the manuscript; The authors have not show the synthetic scale in the manuscript. The
authors should show the yields (both rates and amounts) of synthetic peptides in the manuscript.
2. In lanes 13-15 of Introduction section, the authors described “the N-terminal cysteine residue of
the internal thioester segments must be protected”, but this is only in the case of Native chemical
ligation (NCL) method. Before this sentence, they reviewed peptide condensation methods, and it
was not limited to NCL. As you know, various condensation methods have been reported, such
as NCL, traceless Staudinger ligation, thioester method, Sortase A-mediated ligation and
ketoacid-hydroxylamine ligation. Actually they quoted the article about the thiester method (ref.
2). Thus, the sentence shown above is quite difficult to be understood immediately. The authors
should rewrite Introduction section much more carefully.
3. The authors should quote some articles listed below in Introduction section.
N to C ligation: Takenouchi, T., et al. J. Pept. Sci. 2013; 20: 55-61, Aihara, K., et al. Org. Lett. 2016;
16: 596-599.
One-pot N to C ligation: Otaka, A., Chem. Rec. 2012; 12: 479-490, Asahina, Y., et al. Chem.
Commun. 2017; 53: 2114-2117.
4. It is well known that C-terminal Pro peptide is quite difficult to be synthesized using Wang
resin, because diketopiperazine is formed when Fmoc group of Fmoc-Xaa-Pro-resin is removed
with piperidine (see J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun., 1990; 584-586). I am wondering how did the
authors synthesize peptide C without diketopiperazine formation.
5. In some RP-HPLC chromatograms, very broad peaks were observed. Especially, peptide B
thioester gave a sharp peak in Fig. 2, whereas it came broader in Fig. 5. The column should be
broken, otherwise it seems too much peptide was injected in the ligation experiment. The authors
should perform HPLC experiments using a proper column and appropriate peptide amounts.
6. In Fig. 7, a shoulder was found after the peak 2, whereas the authors did not mention about the
side reaction in this ligation reaction. In addition, this peak had a retention time of approx. 30 min
(panel A), whereas purified product showed that of approx. 28 min (panel B). Why did such
difference occur?
7. The authors’ lists of references 13, 18 and 29 are incorrect.

The revised manuscript written by Hou et al. seems to be improved, although several problems
are still remained. Therefore, this manuscript at this stage is not acceptable for publication in
Royal Society Open Science.
1. Thank you for your providing the using amounts and yields of synthetic peptides. However, a
new problem was arisen. In p. 14, authors described “peptide A thioacid (4.6 mg, 2 mM) and
Npys-peptide B thioester (6.8 mg, 4 mM)”. At first, what do “2 mM” and “4 mM” mean? Peptides
A and B should be 1 umol and 2 umol, respectively. If these values mean the concentration in the
reaction mixture, these are not matched to the description in Materials and Method section. In
addition, the concentrations of peptides A and B were described as 5 mM and 15 mM,
respectively, and therefore the ratio of A and B is disagreed with the description in Results
section. I am wondering which is the real. The description “peptide A+B thioester (4.7 mg, 2 mM)
and peptide C (4.2 mg, 4 mM)” in p. 14 is also contradicted to the method described in Materials
and Methods section.
2. The authors’ lists of some references are still incorrect. For example, “T. W. M.” in ref. 10
should be “Tom W. Muir”. Similar to this, at least refs. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 27, 28, 33 and
38 should be corrected. Before revision, authors should check the References section much more
carefully.
3. In the first ligation, what kind of buffer did authors use? They described just “buffer” in
Materials and Methods section, and the component was missing. In addition, the description of
TCEP treatment after the first ligation was also missing in the methods section.
4. The authors used acetate buffer (pH 7) in CD measurement. However, acetate shows buffer
action only in the pH range between 3.5-5.5, indicating that acetate buffer was not suitable for the
solvent in CD measurement at a neutral pH. Authors should measure the CD spectrum using
other solvent such as phosphate buffer.
11
5. In Figure legends, the term “buffer” should be replaced with “solvent”, because 0.05% TFA
solution never shows a buffer action.
6. Minor points:
p.10, l.19; Is it really “60 mL” cell?
p.10; Abbreviations TCEP and MESNa should be clarified.
p.13, l.15; Replace “Nyps” to “Npys”.
p.14, l.3; What does “10 eq.” mean? 10-equivalents to peptide A or B?

To Reviewer 1:
Thank you for your precious comments.
1. The yield of peptide A thioester was around 60%, and the yield of peptide A thioacid from
thioester was above 95%. The yield of peptide B thioester was above 70%, and the yield of
Npys-peptide B thioester from peptide B thioester was above 80%. The yield of peptide C
was around 70%.
2. I had quoted the reference in which the spectrum without mutation was published. The
spectrum with mutation in my study was the same as that in the reference quoted.
3. The MW calcd was the theoretical value, and that was shown in every figure.
4. I have checked and unified the references one by one.
5. I have added the abbreviations.
Others
I have added the underline.
It was a mistake. I did not use Vydac column.
Trt can be removed by 5% TFA, and I have tested it by Ellman Test.
DFM was a misspelling, and I have changed those to DMF.
To Reviewer 2:
Thank you for your precious comments.
1. I have added some references on N to C ligation via other approaches.
2. I have added the number on MNEI protein sequence.
3. Fortunately, no cyclization occurred, maybe because I added excessive Npys in the
reaction.
To Reviewer 3:
Thank you for your precious comments.
1. The yield of peptide A thioester was around 60%, and the yield of peptide A thioacid from
thioester was above 95%. The yield of peptide B thioester was above 70%, and the yield of
Npys-peptide B thioester from peptide B thioester was above 80%. The yield of peptide C
was around 70%. The isolated yield of the first ligation is 60%, and that of the second is
44%. I have added this data in the results part (P14). At last, we got 3 mg MNEI protein.
And I have deleted “biological activity” in the abstract.
2. I have rewritten the introduction part. “At the beginning, most sequential peptide ligations
were based on the C-to-N strategy using native chemical ligation (NCL), but the N-
terminal cysteine residue of the internal thioester segments must be protected to prevent
undesired self-ligation or cyclization reaction”.
3. I have added the references offered. Thanks.
4. It was well known that Proline was not easy to be added as the first amino acid from the
C terminal, so we did that reaction overnight to increase the efficiency. Then we used
Microwave Peptide Synthesizer to synthesize the rest residues of peptide C, and luckily
we got the correct peptide sequence.
5. For the first ligation reaction, 1 eq. peptide A thioacid and 2 eq. Npys-peptide B thioester
were used. Excessive peptide B was used, maybe that was why its peak looked broad.
6. The shoulder peak 1 was the peptide A+B thioester. Since protein Monellin is very
hydrophilic, the retention time of the protein did not delay much comparing to that of
peptide A+B (substrate). Even though the reaction was not completed, the yield was
around 75%, which was not a bad yield for protein synthesis. After purified, the ligation
product MNEI protein was checked by mass spec and CD spectrum.
7. I have corrected the authors’ list of references 13, 18 and 29.
Appendix B
To Reviewer 2:
Thank you for your suggestions. I have added the reference to the article.
To Reviewer 3:
Thank you for your precious suggestions.
1. Thank you for your question. The ligation reaction system was 200 uL. So the
concentration of peptide A and peptide B was 5 mM and 10 mM respectively. The
concentration of peptide A+B and peptide C was also 5 mM and 10 mM respectively.
Sorry for my bad math.
2. I have rewritten all the author part of the references section.
3. The first ligation system was in acetate buffer (pH3) at the beginning, and was
adjusted to pH 6 by phosphate buffer. And I also added the TCEP treatment to the
Materials and Methods section.
4. The buffer was phosphate buffer indeed.
5. I have changed the “buffer” to “solvent” in the legends.
6. P.10, 1.19; It is 60 uL.
P.10 I have added the full name of TCEP and MESNa when they appeared at the
first time.
P.13, 1,15; I have replaced “Nyps” to “Npys”
P.14, 1.3; 10 eq. to peptide A. Peptide A is 1 eq.(5mM), peptide B was 2 eq,(10mM)
and TCEP was 10 eq.(50mM). I have added the data of concentration in the result
section.
