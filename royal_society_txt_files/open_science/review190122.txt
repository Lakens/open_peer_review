Nakamura et al have reported a series of Manganese poymers that act as cost-effective catalysts
for Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). The manuscript may be accepted with the answers to the
following queries.
1. In PEM electrolysis, the gamma-MnO2 showed higher current density compared to other Mn
oxides The authors should give a plausible reason for this.
2. When the OER activity of the Mn oxides is evaluated in the acidic environment in the absence
of Nafion ionomer, the alpha-MnO2 showed highest activity compared to other oxides. What is
the reason for this behaviour?

omment 1-1.
n PEM electrolysis, the gamma-MnO2 showed higher current density compared to other Mn
xides. The authors should give a plausible reason for this.
eply 1-1.
We would like first to express our appreciation to your comments and questions.
In this study, as mentioned at the end of Section 4.3, we understand that we found the Mn
xides showed similar activity in PEM electrolyzers (Figure 5), even though we observed a
lear crystal structure dependence in an aqueous acidic electrolyte (Figure 7). We expect that
his result may indicate that the surface chemical structure of the Mn oxide samples became
imilar when they were mixed with Nafion ionomer.
Nonetheless, we agree that it is important to clarify the reason why we observed the highest
urrent density when we used <U+F067>-MnO2. By the clarification, we can find a way to optimize
he catalyst.
Here, we note the stable potential window of <U+F067>-MnO2 in an acidic condition (A. Li et al.,
ngew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2019, 58, 5054-5058). Although many parameters affect the
erformance of PEM electrolysis, we expect that the existence of such a stable potential
indow in acid may contribute the high OER activity of <U+F067>-MnO2.Thus, we have added
entences as follows.
entences added (From the 2nd line from the bottom, Page 4):
nvestigation of the reason of the highest activity and the optimization of the material are
urrently underway. However, it is to be noted that <U+F067>-MnO2 has a stable potential window in
n acidic condition, where the OER can be catalyzed efficiently by suppressing the corrosion
eaction (A. Li et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2019, 58, 5054-5058). Therefore, we expect
hat the existence of such a stable potential window in acid may contribute the high OER
ctivity of <U+F067>-MnO2.

omment 1-2.
When the OER activity of the Mn oxides is evaluated in the acidic environment in the absence
f Nafion ionomer, the alpha-MnO2 showed highest activity compared to other oxides. What
s the reason for this behaviour?
eply 1-2.
t the present stage, we could not answer the comment. To obtain the rational reasons for
he different activity trend observed in the systems with and without Nafion ionomer,
pectroscopic characterization at the interface of MnO2 and Nafion is needed. Such studies
re currently under investigation and will be reported elsewhere. Therefore, no revision was
ade on this comment.
