I have carefully read the revised paper and believe that it is somewhat better than the previous
submission. The critiques addressed by the other two reviewer were answered for the most part
satisfactorily. The authors of the paper have clearly done a lot of work, and the results obtained
by them are quite interesting. It reads better now.

Comments to the Author(s)

The research seems mainly focus on the pore size and the absolutely density of the hemp shiv, it
is interesting while there are lots of problems.
Introduction is too long, page 4 lines 31-33 and page 5 lines 1-8 is like the method not the object,
please reconsider.
Page 5, lines 12-14: Hemp shiv is the chopped up, woody core of the hemp plant. The particles of
hemp shiv had a mean length of 7.6 mm and a mean width of 2.4 mm.
The hemp shiv part in the hemp plant such as lower part, middle part, and higher part maybe
have great influence on the physical and mechanical or chemical properties of the hemp shiv
(Variation in physical and mechanical properties of hemp stalk fibers along height of stem;
Influence of hemp plant eccentric growth on physical properties and chemical compounds of
3
hemp hurd ), while you did not give the information of materials in detail. Please give the variety
used in the research, there are many hemp varieties in the world and in France.
Page 13, lines 15-16: The size of hemp shiv showed no effect on the densities obtained. It
indicated that the equilibrium values are independent of particle size.
It is not clear, what is the hemp shiv size? Hemp shiv thickness and diameters? What is the
particle size?
Page 14, lines 18-19: There is the possibility that even helium atoms could not diffuse through the
pit membrane of the hemp shiv.
In fact the pits in the woody materials used covered by something, such as the pectin net or
others. You can research the pits with FE-SEM at 50000, it may be more meaning. It maybe reveal
why the resin cannot enter into the vessels.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors responded to concerns of the reviewers, however some comments were only partly
addressed or misunderstood.
Hemp material from CAVAC: the authors agreed, that hemp variety, retting process, … may
affect porosity. Biogenic material coming from an industrial process often shows a high
variability of properties. Since the study involved detailed examinations at small length scales
(micro- and ultrastructure), knowledge, information and/or discussion about number of tested
samples and expected variability is particularly important. This information is still, at least partly,
missing but is important for the paper since one of the aims is to identify “characteristic qualities
of hemp shiv and the most appropriate techniques that should be used for this characterization”.
4
Definition of terminology (eg. shiv, lime): please define already in the first part of the
introduction instead of defining it in the materials and methods section.
The comments related to the figures/micrographs were not adequately addressed. Eg the cuts for
SEM were not improved, for me it is not clear that F in Fig 3d is indeed a bast fibre and I could
not see “small pores below 1 µm between cell wall layers” ; CLSM image description is still
unchanged (eg. CMS + PW), p 10, lines 10-11 still states that “…middle lamella, which glues the
cells together, shows a clear transition to the adjacent primary cell wall…”
Warts: please clarify in your image of the CT scan that you could only visualize agglomerations
of warts; p11, line 12 “They are composed of high concentrations of lignin..” reference is missing.
Please also explain the stated differences in density. The images of the CT scans do not clearly
show the connection between the pores (probably increasing the resolution could help; would it
be possible to segment parts of the CT scan to better visualize the connections?)
P12 lines 20-22 and 27-29: the text was pasted twice
P15, .lines 8-9, lignin content: reference is missing
TEM: details about sample preparation are missing, eg. what sort of resin was used, how did you
stain the sample? Microscope parameters such as voltage are missing.

To the editorial board of Royal Society Open Science
Dear Alice Power
Thank you for considering this article (Cell wall microstructure, pore size distribution
and absolute density of hemp shiv) to be published in the Journal of Royal Society
Open Science.
The comments by the reviewers were helpful and we have amended the paper to
reflect those comments. Please see below for the list of changes that have been made
in the revised manuscript according to the reviewers’ comments.
We sincerely hope you and the reviewers find the revisions adequate and are looking
forward to your favourable response.
Sincerely,

Reviewers’ comments and responses:
Reviewer # 1:
Comment 1: I have carefully read the revised paper and believe that it is somewhat better
than the previous submission. The critiques addressed by the other two reviewer were
answered for the most part satisfactorily. The authors of the paper have clearly done a lot of
work, and the results obtained by them are quite interesting. It reads better now.
Response: We would like very much to thank the referee for their positive evaluation.
Reviewer # 2:
“The research seems mainly focus on the pore size and the absolutely density of the hemp shiv,
it is interesting while there are lots of problems”.
Comment 1: Introduction is too long, page 4 lines 31-33 and page 5 lines 1-8 is like the
method not the object, and please reconsider.
Response: This comment has been addressed and the paragraph has been rephrased,
as shown in our revised manuscript:
Page 4 lines 31-33 and Page 5 lines 1-6
Comment 2: The hemp shiv part in the hemp plant such as lower part, middle part, and
higher part maybe have great influence on the physical and mechanical or chemical properties
of the hemp shiv (Variation in physical and mechanical properties of hemp stalk fibers along
height of stem; Influence of hemp plant eccentric growth on physical properties and chemical
compounds of hemp hurd ), while you did not give the information of materials in detail. Please
give the variety used in the research, there are many hemp varieties in the world and in France.
Response: The paper is intended to establish suitable techniques to characterise hemp
shiv, rather than to present a detailed study of a particular variety. We have clarified
this by making revisions to the manuscript in the following lines:
Page 2 lines 19-21
Page 5 lines 9-17
Comment 3: Page 13, lines 15-16: The size of hemp shiv showed no effect on the densities
obtained. It indicated that the equilibrium values are independent of particle size. It is not clear,
what is the hemp shiv size? Hemp shiv thickness and diameters? What is the particle size?

Response: This comment has been addressed. The modified Table 2 can be found in
the revised Table captions and the change can be found in the revised manuscript in
the following lines:

Comment 4: Page 14, lines 18-19: There is the possibility that even helium atoms could not
diffuse through the pit membrane of the hemp shiv. In fact the pits in the woody materials
used covered by something, such as the pectin net or others. You can research the pits with FE-
SEM at 50000, it may be more meaning. It maybe reveal why the resin cannot enter into the

Comment 1: Hemp material from CAVAC: the authors agreed, that hemp variety, retting

is still, at least partly, missing but is important for the paper since one of the aims is to identify
“characteristic qualities of hemp shiv and the most appropriate techniques that should be used
for this characterization”.
Response: We have indeed observed such variability in different pieces of hemp shiv,
as can be seen in the differences between porosity and density of the hemp shiv
showed in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4 which are the product of the variability
of the different specimens. The point of this paper is to establish appropriate
techniques for characterisation and to present representative results for typical
material used for construction. We have clarified this in the revised manuscript in the
following lines:
Page 2 Lines 19-21 and
Page 5 lines 9-17

Comment 2: Definition of terminology (eg. shiv, lime): please define already in the first part

manuscript in the following lines:

Eg the cuts for SEM were not improved, for me it is not clear that F in Fig 3d is indeed a bast
fibre and I could not see “small pores below 1 µm between cell wall layers” ;
Response: We have clarified this and made revisions to the descriptions used in Figure
3 (d):
Comment 4: CLSM image description is still unchanged (eg. CMS + PW), p 10, lines 10-11
still states that “…middle lamella, which glues the cells together, shows a clear transition to
