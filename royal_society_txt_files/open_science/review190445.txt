In this manuscript, the reaction between two monolignols by enzymatically oxidation is analyzed
into dilignol is analyzed. one of the final production is found to show the reactivity for new
radical reaction. It is an interesting founding, but as for current version, it is more suitable for a

The authors have proposed a novel mechanism in lignin polymerisation. The biosynthesis of
lignin has attracted the attention of researchers due to its complex nature. It is believed to
proceed by repeated radical coupling reaction of lignols by enzymatic dehydrogenative
polymerisation mechanism. In the present paper the authors have proposed cleavage of a
covalent linkage and creation of new radical coupling site. They have synthesised a labelled
intermediate to support the proposed mechanism and addition of lignol radicals in dilignol
formation. The paper is well written and free from typographical errors. [

The authors have revised the manuscript by introducing few opening remarks in the
introduction section and in conclusion. In order to highlight the reaction between two
monolignols by enzymatic oxidation to dilignols, the revised statement starts with 'Because'
which needs to be changed. Similar minor mistakes are still in the manuscript and need careful
editing.
Other sections in the manuscript are same as in the original manuscript.

[Suggestion and Comments]
In this manuscript, the reaction between two monolignols by enzymatically
oxidation is analyzed into dilignol is analyzed. one of the final production is found to
show the reactivity for new radical reaction. It is an interesting founding, but as for
current version, it is more suitable for a technical report as intermediate results instead
of full published paper. This manuscript lack the story, like the importance of this
founding is unclear to the reader, the potential applications, the conclusion is not clear
enough, the confirming reaction from this finding is missing. It is not suggested to be
published in this current version.
[Answer]
Thank you for your reviewing our manuscript. We revised our paper basically
according to your suggestion and comments.
We added the story of this study to state the importance and application of this
founding for readers in introduction and conclusion as follows.
Introduction:
Because lignocellulosic biomass has a carbon neutral characteristic, it must be
actively utilized for the future sustainable society. Among the main components of
lignocellulosic biomass, polysaccharide components such as cellulose are used for
fibers and paper, but the use of lignin is hardly advanced. One of the reasons is the
complexity of the chemical structure. It is well known that lignin is a phenolic natural
polymer and does not contain a definite repeating unit [1,2]. In order to make effective
use of lignin, it is first necessary to understand its structure. In this study, we
approached the chemical structure of lignin from the viewpoint of biosynthesis.
Conclusion:
Finally, this study expressed a novel aspect of the structural variety of lignin. The a-
O-4' linkage of ß-5’ structure can be cleaved under the mild condition to generate
phenolic oxygen enabling further reactions. This finding will help us not only to
understand the biosynthetic process of lignin but also to do further utilization of lignin
via biological and chemical techniques.

The authors have proposed a novel mechanism in lignin polymerisation. The
biosynthesis of lignin has attracted the attention of researchers due to its complex
nature. It is believed to proceed by repeated radical coupling reaction of lignols by
enzymatic dehydrogenative polymerisation mechanism. In the present paper the authors

They have synthesised a labelled intermediate to support the proposed mechanism and
addition of lignol radicals in dilignol formation. The paper is well written and free from

nk you for your comments. We rewrote the Introduction and Conclusion sections as follows,
oduction:
Lignocellulosic biomass exhibits a carbon neutral characteristic and thus should be utilized
ctively to reduce carbon dioxide emission, which is one of the causes of global warming.
nocellulosic biomass is composed of polysaccharides, such as cellulose, and a phenolic polymer,
in. While cellulose is used in the production of fibres and paper, the use of lignin is limited. One
he reasons is the complexity of its chemical structure. It is well known that lignin is a phenolic
ral polymer and does not contain a definite repeating unit [1,2]. Therefore, understanding the
cture of lignin is essential for its effective use. In this study, we carry out lignin biosynthesis to
understand its structure.
clusion:
Lignin has a highly complicated structure; therefore, we believe that elucidating its structure
d on the experimental results of lignin biosynthesis will lead to its effective use.
Under mild conditions using an enzyme, the a-O-4' linkage of the ß-5' structure was cleaved to
erate a new phenolic reaction site. If this reaction site can be used to introduce new functional
ps industrially, a novel functionalized lignin can be obtained.
We would be grateful if the manuscript could be re-reviewed and considered for publication in
