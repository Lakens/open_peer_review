The paper titled "Experimental and Numerical Investigations on Spray Characteristics of Fatty
Acid Methyl Esters" by Lanjekar and Deshmukh is an excellent research work that can be
published in Royal Society Open Science. It is within the scope of the journal. It is an interesting
study and would contribute to the existing body of literature. I do have some minor concerns
with the current version of the manuscript and would like to suggest a few concerns, which if
addressed, would further improve the understanding of the study.
Suggestions:
1. The authors say that chain length and length of spray tip penetration have a relation that they
observe. Could they provide a bit more information about their discussion in reference to
viscosity, density and surface tension.
2. Could the authors be kind to represent the components of figure 4 and figure 6 in independent
sub figures as it is difficult to observe the difference between the data sets. For figure 4 and figure
6, 30 bar and 40 bar be reperesented in two different figures.
3. from figure 6 it is clear that the simulated data is a good fit to the experimental data for 40 bar
and not a good fit for 30 bar. However the authors claim that both are good fits, can this be
3
edited. Additionally the authors have done their previous work at 40 bar, making my observation
relevant.
4. Can the details of the multi component simulation be presented in a bit more in detail, because
the experimental and simulated data seem to be a very good fit, but no details is provided on
why this is happening cause single component data has some deviation in the trend.

nuscript submitted as follows:

Response to the Reviewer comments
1. The authors say that chain length and length of spray tip penetration have a relation that they
observe. Could they provide a bit more information about their discussion in reference to
viscosity, density and surface tension?
Response: We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestion which has helped us to improve
the manuscript. The following discussion about the effect on spray tip penetration with
respect to the physical properties such as viscosity surface tension and density is included in
the revised manuscript on Page no. 6.
“The physical properties of methyl oleate such as kinematic viscosity, surface tension and
density exhibits higher value than that of methyl laurate. The kinematic viscosity of methyl
oleate is 4.57 mm2 /s, which is around 50% higher than that of methyl laurate. Similarly, the
surface tension of methyl oleate is 6% higher than that of methyl laurate. The spray tip
penetration of methyl oleate is observed to be 15 to 30% longer than that of the methyl
laurate. These physical properties specifically, kinematic viscosity and surface tension
governs the mean diameter of the spray through atomization [15]. The higher viscosity and
surface tension of methyl oleate tends to produce spray with bigger droplets and hence
higher momentum. The spray with higher momentum droplets is able to penetrate longer, as
seen for the case of methyl oleate. The density of the fuel affects the mass flow rate profile
and hence the injected mass per unit time. Hence, fuel with higher density, inject more mass
per unit time, which will be valid for methyl oleate having higher density than that of methyl
laurate.”
2. Could the authors be kind to represent the components of figure 4 and figure 6 in
independent sub figures as it is difficult to observe the difference between the data sets. For
figure 4 and figure 6, 30 bar and 40 bar be represented in two different figures.
Response: We thank the reviewer for suggestion.
“The figure 4 is divided in two separate figure (Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b)) to represent the effect
of fuel on spray tip penetration at 40 bar and 30 bar ambient pressure separately.”
“The figure 6 is divided in two separate figure (Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 6(b)) to compare measured
and predicted spray tip penetration at 40 bar and 30 bar ambient pressure separately.”
3. From figure 6 it is clear that the simulated data is a good fit to the experimental data for 40
bar and not a good fit for 30 bar. However the authors claim that both are good fits, can this
be edited. Additionally the authors have done their previous work at 40 bar, making my
observation relevant.
Response: We apologize for the miss-communication caused. The deviation of the predicted data
from the experimental results is observed during early part of the spray tip penetration. The
explanation is given in the manuscript on page no. 7 as given below:
“The difference in the spray tip penetration during an initial part of spray injection is due to
initial transient nature of the spray and assumed fuel mass injection rate [30-32].”
4. Can the details of the multi component simulation be presented in a bit more in detail,
because the experimental and simulated data seem to be a very good fit, but no details is
provided on why this is happening cause single component data has some deviation in the
trend.
Response: We thank the reviewer for important suggestion. The details of multi-component
simulation are given in the revised manuscripts as below on page no.9. The multi-
component spray simulation is able to predict tip penetration closer to that of measurement
since the physical properties for simulation are near to that of biodiesel compared to that of
single component simulation.
“The input to the multi-component model used in the study is the liquid mass fraction of
major five components present in the biodiesel. The biodiesel property is evaluated with
mixture rule using physical properties of each pure component. The mixture rule for
calculating physical properties of the biodiesel is given in Eq. 4.”
