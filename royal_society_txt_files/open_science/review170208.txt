The article presents a sophisticated approach to understanding technological development by
focusing on the preservation of complex information and its faithful transmission. The model
does not preclude the researchers from making the important observation that technological
development is not unidirectional. They also illustrate how horizontal transfer only takes place
within the same dialect community. The model, therefore, does not help in explaining how
variety between communities comes to be. I would like to see some explanation of why within
the clearly demonstrated tendencies to over-learning and discouragement of innovation, some
changes are adopted very rapidly. The authors indicate that the use of industrial yarns and dies
did not meet much resistance. In my own work I have found a sharp divide between
communities in which some immediately adopt these new materials, while others resist and a
third group uses traditional and modern materials and combines them without hesitance.
Forthermore, I wonder what the influence of cross craftsmanship is in relation to loom changes,
where weavers and carpenters collaborate?

When asked to review the Evolution of Ancient Technology I envisioned a manuscript discussing
the evolutionary pathways leading to loom technologies based on firm archaeological evidence
given that it was submitted to Open Science. The problems we have identified in this review arise
from basic differences between the theoretical perspectives and methodologies used in
archaeology (a scientific discipline) and those used in anthropology (social sciences). More
specifically, the authors’ cross-disciplinary study uses data from contemporary textiles to
investigate pattern and process in the transmission of traditional weaving practices in East Asia
and Southeast Asia from the Neolithic through to the modern period. The conflation of
ethnographic and technological evidence from museum collections with archaeological evidence
has led to conclusions without temporal context.
3
The study is derived from Basalla’s Theory of Technological Change (1998) that challenges long
established paradigms that generally attribute technological change to human agency (individual
invention). Buckley and Boudot also present a model to explain technological changes that
archaeologists would normally consider to be man-made developments in loom technology. In
this manuscript, the authors attribute technological change to self- propagation. Because of our
disciplinary bias, we confine our comments to the technical issues.
The technical data on which the model is based is unquestionably of a high standard but we
question the following statements:
(a) "There is no evidence that it is necessary for a weaver to have a general understanding of
how the loom works (a ‘theory of the loom’), as long as they can recall the procedures for using
it" (page 6 [47-59]). We are curious to know how many participants were asked about this,
particularly in relation to simple looms.
(b) We disagree with the assertion that a warp spacer is not useful in a frame loom (page 10
[16-29]). The warp spacer is used on floor looms during the winding-on process to make sure the
warps wind-on evenly and is subsequently left in the loom.
(c) There is a problem equating complexity with advancement or development (page 9 (3-
18): simplification without loss of function is the essence of development and certainly
demonstrates progress.
(d) The results showing that weaving knowledge in traditional Asian societies is passed
from mother to daughter is already well established in anthropology.
(e) The authors describe only one mode of production – household production- whereas
archaeological and historical evidence indicate that weaving workshops existed in Asia as early
as the Shang dynasty. Weaving scenes show Han Chinese women controlling weaving
workshops on bronze cowry containers from Southwest China. Historical sources also refer to the
presence of weaving workshops in royal palaces (see Kuhn 1988) controlled by elite Chinese
women.
Although the model is novel and fits the empirical data, we are not convinced of its validity.
While we do not purport to be experts in scientific models, the authors do not appear to have
established a causal link between loom technology and social development, scientifically. The
simple backstrap loom on which the hypothesis is based also occurs in South America and in
order to test the predictability of the model and replicate the results we examined empirical
evidence from South America. There is no evidence that loom technology was self-propagating,
ie. gradually evolved into the frame loom during the Maya, Aztec or Inca periods when societies
became more complex as the model predicts but that the frame loom was introduced by the
Spanish in the 15th century during the colonial period.
The technological data published in the authors’ recent monograph ‘The Roots of Asian Weaving’
(Buckley and Boudot 2015) on which this analysis is based is very impressive and we recognize
the strength of the research. We suggest that the manuscript might be more appropriate in a
Social Science journal such as Current Anthropology which publishes longer, more detailed
discussions of current issues in anthropology.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
Thank you for you paper, which we have discussed at editorial level (as it falls outside the scope
of our editors). I agreed to handle you MS, as I am most interested in the way you have
integrated a range of ideas and approaches from different disciplines. In addition I feel that
label_version_2
RSOS should include work of the discipline spanning type, to ensure the widest possible
exposure to the work.
The two referees that I have used have very different views on the MS, once is very keen to
accept, the other argues for rejection.
I am not in a strong position to exert a strong editorial influence as the work is outside the scope
of my knowledge and experience. I am therefore left in the position in which I cannot accept the
MS.
I suggest that you consider the comments made by Referee 2 (who in fact suggest that this paper
be published in a Social Science journal), and would be happy to handle a revised version. By
rejecting and allowing resubmission, I will be able to appoint a different of referees. I cannot of
course guarantee that a revised version would be accepted by the journal.

This is another in a line of publications by Buckley and Boudot on the evolutionary history of
weaving. It’s important to point out that I said “evolutionary history” as opposed to simply
“history.” There is a huge distinction between the two. The second is important, but it simply
chronicles a sequence of technological events—what came before/after what—but the first goes a
step further and attempts to demonstrate what actually produced what as opposed to simply one
thing preceding another in time. Biologists have long understood the difference and in the 1960s
began developing methods to track the evolutionary (phylogenetic) history of biological lineages.
Anthropologists and archaeologists began paying attention to these beginning in the late 1990s
and have made huge inroads into understanding the evolutionary history of language, customs,
and a wide variety of tools. Buckley and Boudot have focused on weaving in eastern and
Southeast Asia, similar to the work of Jamie Tehrani and colleagues.
I have a number of comments on the presentation, but I should state at the start that none of them
sinks the paper. For the most part, the comments are suggestions for strengthening the argument
or clearing up mistakes. Many of the comments appear directly on the manuscript itself, which I
am uploading, so I won’t bother repeating them here.
• Page 2 — I have an issue with the first paragraph of the introduction. The authors state that
few studies have succeeded in connecting microlevel processes and broad-scale patterns. First,
that’s simply not true, and second, that’s like berating geneticists with not understanding all the
population-genetics patterns out there. They’re two different things, usually worked on
sequentially and often by different groups of scientists. The authors make it sound as if only they
have finally cracked the nut. Not true.
• Page 3 — The five questions they pose are excellent.
• Page 8 — The paragraph that starts “Most of the focus of recent work” is key to the arguments
that all of us who do cultural phylogenetics make: There is horizontal transmission is culture.
Critics make it sound as if that fact undermines attempts to use phylogenetic methods, but they
overlook the fact that the natural world is replete with examples of introgression (interbreeding
among species and the production of viable offspring). This fact, however, has not led to
biologists and paleontologists throwing up their hands in despair. Rather, they acknowledge the
issue and figure out how to deal with it. Buckley and Boudot do the same.
• Page 9 — In the first paragraph the authors note that they’re using the retention index (RI) but
don’t say why. The RI measures the fit of characters to a rooted cladogram (phylogenetic tree),
whereas another common measure, the consistency index (CI) measures the amount of
homoplasy in a data set. As we know, there are several potential drawbacks to the consistency
index, one of which is that the CI value is not independent of the number of taxa. When the
number of taxa increases, the CI value will decrease. This makes it less ideal than the RI. The
authors, of course, know this; I think they should spell it out for readers who will not know what
these measures are and why the authors used the RI.
• Page 9 — After reading the second paragraph, it occurred to me that the authors could have
carried out a network analysis as a companion to their tree. I’m not saying they should in this
paper, but I think it would/might help to resolve relationships.
9
• Page 9 — In paragraph 4, the reference [14] is wrong
• Page 10 — Great discussion in the paragraph that starts “Despite the fact that a phylogenetic
model . . . .” This is a key point.
• Page 11 —In the top line, I don’t think they mean “homologous.” If something is
independently invented but appears in only one descendant, it’s apomorphic, but it’s not
“homologous.”
• Page 12 — In paragraph 2 the authors are talking about repetition and encoding “blocks” of
information. I think the authors would benefit from reading an article by Richard Pocklington
and Michael L. Best: “Cultural evolution and units of selection in replicating text.” Journal of
Theoretical Biology 188: 79–87.
• Excellent figures.
In summary, I think this paper makes an excellent addition to the literature on phylogenetic
analyses of cultural phenomena in general and to the evolutionary history of weaving in Asia. As
the authors point out in their abstract, there is enough detail and resolution in their results to help
us critique standard models and assumptions that have been advanced to describe the evolution
of culture.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_6
This paper brings new data and insights into the long-term transmission of technologies and
traditions. As a case study it is impressive in scope and likely to be of interest to a variety of
researchers in different disciplines, including archaeologists, anthropologists, and evolutionary
biologists. The methods are appropriate and the analyses are generally well executed, although
10
there are some aspects which in my opinion require further attention. I also feel that some of the
literature review and discussion would benefit from being more focused.
Comments & Suggestions:
Title: Too vague and needs to be more specific/informative – e.g. 'The evolution of an ancient
technology: a phylogenetic analysis of Asian loom weaving'
Section 1: Introduction:
The aims of the study seem slightly confused (or at least, I found them confusing as a reader). The
introduction (particularly top of page 3) suggests the main research question concerns the
emergence of complex technology, but most of the paper seems to focus on the relationship
between modes of cultural learning and patterns of cultural macro-evolution. Although the two
are not unrelated, the link is not articulated very clearly and the appeal to the cumulative cultural
evolution literature is somewhat unconvincing and patchy (for instance, the paper does not
address major hypotheses concerning the development of complex technological traditions, such
as demographic factors or social learning strategies like copy-successful individuals). I would
suggest refocusing the aims of the paper around the first issue (micro- and macro- cultural
transmission), which is the one that this study can a significant contribution to.
p.2: "relatively few studies have succeeding in connecting these aspects [micro and macro
transmission". These studies should be cited.
p. 2 & p. 5: The phrase "where [weaving information] resides" is a bit vague. In what sense does
knowledge reside somewhere other than the brain? Maybe "distributed" would be a better term.
Section 3. It would be useful to separate out the area surveys from the second-hand summaries of
craft transmission taken from the literature. The results of the former could be presented in a
table showing the modes of transmission for various components (or for the 4 categories of
knowledge given on page 7).
Section 5 (and ESM): Phylogenetic analyses:
The description of Bayesian phylogenetic methods in the ESM is not very accurate. It should
explain that the MCMC analysis samples trees at regular intervals to generate a posterior
distribution of trees (sampled in proportion to their probability). The posterior distribution of
trees is then used to calculate (posterior) support for individual clades, integrating uncertainty
over tree topologies and model parameters.
From what I can tell, the output of the Bayesian analysis (the tree file) was summarised as a
consensus tree, not a consensus network (as implemented in programs like SplitsTree to show
conflicting relationships – which won't be apparent at the 70% level).
Ancestral state reconstructions:
There is a bit of an issue with these analyses in that the traits are being traced on a tree as though
the tree was independent of the traits, whereas in fact the tree itself was generated by those traits
in the first place (based on a previously assumed set of ancestral states, rates of evolutionary
change, etc. – which are now being re-estimated but on a fixed tree topology). Usually, this kind
of analysis would trace traits on an independent tree. For instance, a behavioural trait might be
reconstructed on a genetic tree, or a cultural trait on a language tree. I think that the approach
taken here would require some kind of justification in the text, e.g. the authors might point out
that for these data there is no viable "independent tree" (such as a language tree, or mtDNA tree
which might be a good model for a maternally transmitted cultural tradition). Alternatively, I
would suggest inferring ancestral states and the tree simultaneously, during the MCMC analysis.
This can be done using the "report ancestral states" command in MrBayes. It is rather laborious,
since it can only be done one node at a time, but would at least work around the problem of non-
11
independence, and also have the virtue of integrating uncertainty across model parameters and
tree topologies (whereas the current analysis employs a single model and one consensus tree). If
the authors do adopt this approach (which I really think would be more rigorous) it might make
sense to target a few specific nodes of particular interest, rather than doing every single node in
the tree, which would take a very long time.
How were the graphical representations of gains and losses on the tree rendered? Was some kind
of software used?
The interpretation of node support values (ESM):
I think this section is misleading. Even under pure vertical transmission you would expect
posterior support values below 100% due to convergence, parallelism, etc. It would not only be
due to missing data or noise. By the same token, in this dataset values below 100% should not be
interpreted solely as evidence of horizontal transmission, which is only one source of homoplasy
in cultural evolution.
Correlation with societal complexity:
This analysis is problematic as it does not control for phylogenetic (or spatial) autocorrelation.
This seems important, given the strong phylogenetic signal in the assemblages. In the
circumstances, think the analysis would have to be re-done to control for historical relatedness, or
excluded from the paper. Given that societal complexity seems somewhat tangential to the main
focus of the paper, the latter may be the more straightforward option.
Section 7 Discussion
7.3 (p. 14): Transmission within versus between communities
It would be worth discussing Tehrani & Collard's 2009 study on inter- versus intra- group
cultural transmission here. That study (which is cited in the references) focused on the same
issues as those addressed in this paper and was similarly concerned with weaving technologies.
Moreover, it hightlighs the importance of factors like marriage patterns and modes of learning
that are also clearly relevant to this study. These parallels suggest that there are some general
principles of cultural evolution that are worth commenting on.
ESM:
In Section 3.4 of the ESM where the sources are described, why are Mexican weavers included? If
the scope of the review extends beyond SE Asia, then why not include other studies too (e.g.
loom weavers of Central Asia, Iran, Europe, etc.)?

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
Thank you for your patience with my handling of your MS.
I am pleased by the second set of reviewers, who raise a number of important issues. I would
suggest that you explain to the more general reader the distinction between retention index (RI)
and consistency index (CI) as suggested by Mike O’Brien.

Referee 2 asks you consider re-writing the introduction to better articulate the link between the
relationship between modes of cultural learning / patterns of cultural macro-evolution and the
emergence of complex technology, this issue troubled me less than Referee 2, but I would ask you
to consider this.
The most significant issue to consider is made by Referee 2, namely the ancestral state
reconstructions - “the traits are being traced on a tree as though the tree was independent of the
traits, whereas in fact the tree itself was generated by those traits in the first place”. This is I am
afraid outside my area of expertise, however Referee 2 suggests two alternative solutions - either
(i) justification in the text of your approach or (ii) inferring ancestral states and the tree
simultaneously, during the MCMC analysis. The latter requires more work, but would seem to
me to be the most desirable route, although like Referee 2, I leave the decision to you. Similarly I
leave the decision to you whether you also want to consider display this as a consensus network -
as also noted by Referee 2.

This is another in a line of publications by Buckley and Boudot on the evolutionary history of
weaving. It’s important to point out that I said “evolutionary history” as opposed to simply
“history.” There is a huge distinction between the two. The second is important, but it simply
chronicles a sequence of technological events—what came before/after what—but the first goes a
step further and attempts to demonstrate what actually produced what as opposed to simply one
thing preceding another in time. Biologists have long understood the difference and in the 1960s
began developing methods to track the evolutionary (phylogenetic) history of biological lineages.
Anthropologists and archaeologists began paying attention to these beginning in the late 1990s
and have made huge inroads into understanding the evolutionary history of language, customs,
and a wide variety of tools. Buckley and Boudot have focused on weaving in eastern and
Southeast Asia, similar to the work of Jamie Tehrani and colleagues.
I have a number of comments on the presentation, but I should state at the start that none of them
sinks the paper. For the most part, the comments are suggestions for strengthening the argument
or clearing up mistakes. Many of the comments appear directly on the manuscript itself, which I
am uploading, so I won’t bother repeating them here.
• Page 2 — I have an issue with the first paragraph of the introduction. The authors state that few
studies have succeeded in connecting microlevel processes and broad-scale patterns. First, that’s
simply not true, and second, that’s like berating geneticists with not understanding all the
population-genetics patterns out there. They’re two different things, usually worked on
sequentially and often by different groups of scientists. The authors make it sound as if only they
have finally cracked the nut. Not true.
• Page 3 — The five questions they pose are excellent.
• Page 8 — The paragraph that starts “Most of the focus of recent work” is key to the arguments
that all of us who do cultural phylogenetics make: There is horizontal transmission is culture.
Critics make it sound as if that fact undermines attempts to use phylogenetic methods, but they
overlook the fact that the natural world is replete with examples of introgression (interbreeding
among species and the production of viable offspring). This fact, however, has not led to
biologists and paleontologists throwing up their hands in despair. Rather, they acknowledge the
issue and figure out how to deal with it. Buckley and Boudot do the same.
• Page 9 — In the first paragraph the authors note that they’re using the retention index (RI) but
don’t say why. The RI measures the fit of characters to a rooted cladogram (phylogenetic tree),
whereas another common measure, the consistency index (CI) measures the amount of
15
homoplasy in a data set. As we know, there are several potential drawbacks to the consistency
index, one of which is that the CI value is not independent of the number of taxa. When the
number of taxa increases, the CI value will decrease. This makes it less ideal than the RI. The
authors, of course, know this; I think they should spell it out for readers who will not know what
these measures are and why the authors used the RI.
• Page 9 — After reading the second paragraph, it occurred to me that the authors could have
carried out a network analysis as a companion to their tree. I’m not saying they should in this
paper, but I think it would/might help to resolve relationships.
• Page 9 — In paragraph 4, the reference [14] is wrong
• Page 10 — Great discussion in the paragraph that starts “Despite the fact that a phylogenetic
model . . . .” This is a key point.
• Page 11 —In the top line, I don’t think they mean “homologous.” If something is independently
invented but appears in only one descendant, it’s apomorphic, but it’s not “homologous.”
• Page 12 — In paragraph 2 the authors are talking about repetition and encoding “blocks” of
information. I think the authors would benefit from reading an article by Richard Pocklington
and Michael L. Best: “Cultural evolution and units of selection in replicating text.” Journal of
Theoretical Biology 188: 79–87.
• Excellent figures.
In summary, I think this paper makes an excellent addition to the literature on phylogenetic
analyses of cultural phenomena in general and to the evolutionary history of weaving in Asia. As
the authors point out in their abstract, there is enough detail and resolution in their results to help
us critique standard models and assumptions that have been advanced to describe the evolution
of culture.
Referee 2
This paper brings new data and insights into the long-term transmission of technologies and
traditions. As a case study it is impressive in scope and likely to be of interest to a variety of
researchers in different disciplines, including archaeologists, anthropologists, and evolutionary
biologists. The methods are appropriate and the analyses are generally well executed, although
there are some aspects which in my opinion require further attention. I also feel that some of the
literature review and discussion would benefit from being more focused.
Comments & Suggestions:
Title: Too vague and needs to be more specific/informative – e.g. 'The evolution of an ancient
technology: a phylogenetic analysis of Asian loom weaving'
Section 1: Introduction:
The aims of the study seem slightly confused (or at least, I found them confusing as a reader). The
introduction (particularly top of page 3) suggests the main research question concerns the
emergence of complex technology, but most of the paper seems to focus on the relationship
between modes of cultural learning and patterns of cultural macro-evolution. Although the two
are not unrelated, the link is not articulated very clearly and the appeal to the cumulative cultural
evolution literature is somewhat unconvincing and patchy (for instance, the paper does not
address major hypotheses concerning the development of complex technological traditions, such
as demographic factors or social learning strategies like copy-successful individuals). I would
16
suggest refocusing the aims of the paper around the first issue (micro- and macro- cultural
transmission), which is the one that this study can a significant contribution to.
p.2: "relatively few studies have succeeding in connecting these aspects [micro and macro
transmission". These studies should be cited.
p. 2 & p. 5: The phrase "where [weaving information] resides" is a bit vague. In what sense does
knowledge reside somewhere other than the brain? Maybe "distributed" would be a better term.
Section 3. It would be useful to separate out the area surveys from the second-hand summaries of
craft transmission taken from the literature. The results of the former could be presented in a
table showing the modes of transmission for various components (or for the 4 categories of
knowledge given on page 7).
Section 5 (and ESM): Phylogenetic analyses:
The description of Bayesian phylogenetic methods in the ESM is not very accurate. It should
explain that the MCMC analysis samples trees at regular intervals to generate a posterior
distribution of trees (sampled in proportion to their probability). The posterior distribution of
trees is then used to calculate (posterior) support for individual clades, integrating uncertainty
over tree topologies and model parameters.
From what I can tell, the output of the Bayesian analysis (the tree file) was summarised as a
consensus tree, not a consensus network (as implemented in programs like SplitsTree to show
conflicting relationships – which won't be apparent at the 70% level).
Ancestral state reconstructions:
There is a bit of an issue with these analyses in that the traits are being traced on a tree as though
the tree was independent of the traits, whereas in fact the tree itself was generated by those traits
in the first place (based on a previously assumed set of ancestral states, rates of evolutionary
change, etc. – which are now being re-estimated but on a fixed tree topology). Usually, this kind
of analysis would trace traits on an independent tree. For instance, a behavioural trait might be
reconstructed on a genetic tree, or a cultural trait on a language tree. I think that the approach
taken here would require some kind of justification in the text, e.g. the authors might point out
that for these data there is no viable "independent tree" (such as a language tree, or mtDNA tree
which might be a good model for a maternally transmitted cultural tradition). Alternatively, I
would suggest inferring ancestral states and the tree simultaneously, during the MCMC analysis.
This can be done using the "report ancestral states" command in MrBayes. It is rather laborious,
since it can only be done one node at a time, but would at least work around the problem of non-
independence, and also have the virtue of integrating uncertainty across model parameters and
tree topologies (whereas the current analysis employs a single model and one consensus tree). If
the authors do adopt this approach (which I really think would be more rigorous) it might make
sense to target a few specific nodes of particular interest, rather than doing every single node in
the tree, which would take a very long time.
How were the graphical representations of gains and losses on the tree rendered? Was some kind
of software used?
The interpretation of node support values (ESM):
I think this section is misleading. Even under pure vertical transmission you would expect
posterior support values below 100% due to convergence, parallelism, etc. It would not only be
due to missing data or noise. By the same token, in this dataset values below 100% should not be
interpreted solely as evidence of horizontal transmission, which is only one source of homoplasy
in cultural evolution.
Correlation with societal complexity:
17
This analysis is problematic as it does not control for phylogenetic (or spatial) autocorrelation.
This seems important, given the strong phylogenetic signal in the assemblages. In the
circumstances, think the analysis would have to be re-done to control for historical relatedness, or
excluded from the paper. Given that societal complexity seems somewhat tangential to the main
focus of the paper, the latter may be the more straightforward option.
Section 7 Discussion
7.3 (p. 14): Transmission within versus between communities
It would be worth discussing Tehrani & Collard's 2009 study on inter- versus intra- group
cultural transmission here. That study (which is cited in the references) focused on the same
issues as those addressed in this paper and was similarly concerned with weaving technologies.
Moreover, it highlights the importance of factors like marriage patterns and modes of learning
that are also clearly relevant to this study. These parallels suggest that there are some general
principles of cultural evolution that are worth commenting on.
ESM:
In Section 3.4 of the ESM where the sources are described, why are Mexican weavers included? If
the scope of the review extends beyond SE Asia, then why not include other studies too (e.g.
loom weavers of Central Asia, Iran, Europe, etc.)?

Research Article: ‘The evolution of an ancient technology’
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to resubmit this paper.
We have carefully considered the comments of two reviewers on a previous submission of this paper,
and we have taken the opportunity to rewrite and clarify it. The comments of the reviewers and our
responses are appended at the end of this letter.
We acknowledge the difficulty of finding suitable reviewers for cross-disciplinary study of this type. The
two reviewers of the previous submission of this paper both had expertise in weaving technology (good).
Both complimented us on the quality of our technical data on loom technology. However the real focus
of this paper is not weaving per se, but the insights into cultural transmission and cultural evolution that
can be gained from its study. So we suggest selecting reviewers who are experienced in this field. In this
regard, we took the opportunity to discuss the reviewer’s comments with Stephen Shennan (Professor of
Archaeology at UCL), who has been a supporter of our work, and who is knowledgeable in this area. He
suggested the following people as possible reviewers:
Dr Jamie Tehrani, Dept of Anthropology, Univ of Durham.
Prof Peter Jordan, Arctic Studies Centre, Univ of Groningen
Prof Russell Gray, Max Planck Institute for the Sciences of Human History, Jena.
Prof Mike O’Brien, Dept of Anthropology, Univ of Missouri at Columbia
(We have not discussed this work with any of these researchers).
We submitted this paper to RSOS firstly because the Royal Society has taken a leadership role in
publishing similar work related to cultural evolution, secondly because we think Open Access will enable
it to reach a wide audience, and thirdly because the online format of the journal means that it can
accept a longer submission than a print journal can normally handle.
The cover letter for the previous submission is appended below, for reference.
With best regards.

Research Article: ‘The evolution of an ancient technology’
My co-author (Eric Boudot) and I submit this research article for consideration for publication in the
Royal Society Open Science journal. It describes a study and analysis of weaving loom technologies in
East and Southeast Asia.
In the past two decades there has been a great deal of work done on the evolution of culture. The larger
part of this work has consisted of analytical or agent-based modelling, or general/philosophical debates
on how best to understand cultural processes. There is a need for high quality empirical studies with
which to test and refine these ideas, and the present paper is (we think) an important contribution in
this regard.
Related work has been carried out by Tehrani et al on Iranian tribal weaving traditions, and by the
present authors on textile motifs in Southeast Asia and loom technology in Southwest China (these
works are cited in the Introduction). In comparison with previous work, the present study breaks new
ground in both the depth and breadth of the observations it contains and in our integration of
observations at a range of scales, from ‘micro’ to ‘macro’. Based on published data we build an empirical
model for the transmission of weaving cultures, and then examine the consequences of these
transmission processes over a wide area via a quantitative analysis of the loom technologies of 86
distinct traditions. The results allow us to begin to critique theoretical models of cultural evolution, as
well as confirming some general principles that govern the maintenance of long-lived cultural traditions.
All of the data supporting this article have been included in the paper and uploaded as part of the
supplementary material. The dataset on loom technology has been uploaded in the form of a Nexus file
that allows our analysis to be replicated straightforwardly.
A part of the looms dataset have been previously published (reference 13) in a publication that focuses
on ethnography and textile culture. The analysis of this data for its cultural evolutionary implications
that we present here is wholly new, however.
We thank Professor Stephen Shennan of UCL for providing us with helpful comments on an earlier draft
of this paper.
With best regards.

The comments of referees on a previous submission of this paper are shown in italics, with our
responses underneath in plain type.
Referee 1
The article presents a sophisticated approach to understanding technological development by focusing
on the preservation of complex information and its faithful transmission.
The model does not preclude the researchers from making the important observation that technological
development is not unidirectional.
We agree.
They also illustrate how horizontal transfer only takes place within the same dialect community.
We have stated that horizontal transfer comes in two varieties: within community, and between
community. The former is common, the latter rare. Both phenomena occur, however, and both are
necessary to explain our results. We have re-written our paper to try to clarify this and avoid this
misunderstanding.
The model, therefore, does not help in explaining how variety between communities comes to be.
This happens via the accumulation of inventions and innovations. We have attempted to clarify this point
in the revised paper.
I would like to see some explanation of why within the clearly demonstrated tendencies to over-learning
and discouragement of innovation, some changes are adopted very rapidly. The authors indicate that the
use of industrial yarns and dies did not meet much resistance. In my own work I have found a sharp
divide between communities in which some immediately adopt these new materials, while others resist
and a third group uses traditional and modern materials and combines them without hesitance.
This is an important question, and we have added a more detailed discussion to attempt to answer it.
Furthermore, I wonder what the influence of cross craftsmanship is in relation to loom changes, were
weavers and carpenters collaborate?
This is a good question. We are not able to give a definitive answer, since we have not investigated the
influence of carpenters directly. What we have discovered (and we have clarified this point in the text) is
that where complex looms are concerned, the carpenter must have an old loom available to copy.
Referee 2
When asked to review the Evolution of Ancient Technology I envisioned a manuscript discussing the
evolutionary pathways leading to loom technologies based on firm archaeological evidence given that it
was submitted to Open Science. The problems we have identified in this review arise from basic
differences between the theoretical perspectives and methodologies used in archaeology (a scientific
discipline) and those used in anthropology (social sciences).
Ours is science paper, using a science-based and data-based approach to uncover pathways in cultural
evolution, using data from contemporary material culture. It is not an archaeology paper, however. Our
approach is different to discursive approaches normally found in ‘social science’ journals, but it is part of
a growing field. We have added some more references and examples of the systematic analysis of
cultural transmission and cultural evolution to clarify this.
More specifically, the authors’ cross-disciplinary study uses data from contemporary textiles to
investigate pattern and process in the transmission of traditional weaving practices in East Asia and
Southeast Asia from the Neolithic through to the modern period.
No, we have investigated loom technologies (only), not contemporary textiles. This point is clearly
expressed in our paper and we are at a loss to understand why the reviewer thinks that textiles were
used.
The conflation of ethnographic and technological evidence from museum collections with archaeological
evidence has led to conclusions without temporal context.
Using archaeological data to root a phylogeny of looms is not “conflation”, and we regard a multi-
disciplinary approach as a strength, not a weakness. Nevertheless we have re-written our paper to
attempt to clarify how we use various kinds of data.
The study is derived from Basalla’s Theory of Technological Change (1998) that challenges long
established paradigms that generally attribute technological change to human agency (individual
invention).
Basala’s wrote about technology in a general way. We have used a specific technique (Bayesian
phylogenetic analysis) justified by detailed evidence of conservative transmission. We do not use any
assumptions derived from Basala’s work. We agree with the reviewer that technological change is
attributable to human agency, and this is an essential part of our model. We have attempted to clarify
this in our revised text (section 7.5).
Buckley and Boudot also present a model to explain technological changes that archaeologists would
normally consider to be man-made developments in loom technology. In this manuscript, the authors
attribute technological change to self- propagation. Because of our disciplinary bias, we confine our
comments to the technical issues.
See previous comment. There is no conflict between our work and the notion of human agency, in fact
our model cannot operate without it.
The technical data on which the model is based is unquestionably of a high standard
but we question the following statements:
(a) "There is no evidence that it is necessary for a weaver to have a general understanding of how the
loom works (a ‘theory of the loom’), as long as they can recall the procedures for using it" (page 6 [47-
59]). We are curious to know how many participants were asked about this, particularly in relation to
simple looms.
This is a good question: we have re-written our comments to clarify this. The essential point is that
some weavers have an excellent understanding of how complex looms work, but this understanding is
not a requirement in order for a novice to begin weaving, since this is based on learning the procedures
for weaving, not a set of general principles.
(b) We disagree with the assertion that a warp spacer is not useful in a frame loom (page 10 [16-29]).
The warp spacer is used on floor looms during the winding-on process to make sure the warps wind-on
evenly and is subsequently left in the loom.
The reviewer is correct. We used the wrong term, what we are referring to is a warp spreader rather
than a warp spacer. We have corrected this point in the text.
(c) There is a problem equating complexity with advancement or development (page 9 (3-18):
simplification without loss of function is the essence of development and certainly demonstrates
progress.
We do not use the terms “progress” and “advancement” in our study, since they lack precise definitions,
so we are not sure what the reviewer’s point is.
(d) The results showing that weaving knowledge in traditional Asian societies is passed from mother to
daughter is already well established in anthropology.
We agree, and we have stated this in our paper.
(e) The authors describe only one mode of production – household production- whereas archaeological
and historical evidence indicate that weaving workshops existed in Asia as early as the Shang dynasty.
This is a good point. Some of the looms we have considered were indeed used in workshops, and we
have added a paragraph (section 7.4) commenting on the differences between domestic and workshop
production.
Weaving scenes show Han Chinese women controlling weaving workshops on bronze cowry containers
from Southwest China. Historical sources also refer to the presence of weaving workshops in royal
palaces (see Kuhn 1988) controlled by elite Chinese women.
This is correct, but falls outside the scope of our study.
Although the model is novel and fits the empirical data, we are not convinced of its validity.
The reviewer comments that the model fits the data, and says that he/she is not convinced by it, but
gives no specific reason, so it is difficult for us to comment.
While we do not purport to be experts in scientific models, the authors do not appear to have
established a causal link between loom technology and social development, scientifically.
We agree. We have not claimed any causal link. As we stated in our text: “This association does not
prove that there is a causal link between the two, but it does fit with our intuition about the
characteristics of more complex societies.”
The simple backstrap loom on which the hypothesis is based also occurs in South America and in order
to test the predictability of the model and replicate the results we examined empirical evidence from
South America. There is no evidence that loom technology was self-propagating, ie. gradually evolved
into the frame loom during the Maya, Aztec or Inca periods when societies became more complex as the
model predicts but that the frame loom was introduced by the Spanish in the 15th century during the
colonial period.
Our study does not show that technology inevitably progresses from simple to complex forms. It shows
precisely the opposite: some lineages become more complex, some remain the same (stasis), in a few
simplification has occurred. As we stated in our paper:
“we would expect long periods of technological stasis to be the norm in the absence of external factors
(such as competition within or between cultures) that might drive increased technological complexity.”
Given this, we are at a loss to understand why the reviewer has taken us to task on this point. The
example of South American weaving that the reviewer quotes is a good example of stasis (at least until
the Spanish conquest), and exactly parallels the situation we have found in East Nusa Tenggara, Hainan
etc.
We have added another paragraph in an attempt to re-emphasize these points.
The technological data published in the authors’ recent monograph ‘The Roots of Asian Weaving’
(Buckley and Boudot 2015) on which this analysis is based is very impressive and we recognize the
strength of the research.
Appendix B
Response to reviewers and editorial comments (our responses appear below the original comments,
preceeded by an asterisk)
I am pleased by the second set of reviewers, who raise a number of important issues.
I would suggest that you explain to the more general reader the distinction between retention index (RI)
and consistency index (CI) as suggested by Mike O’Brien.
*Agreed, we have added a discussion of this point.
Referee 2 asks you consider re-writing the introduction to better articulate the link between the
relationship between modes of cultural learning / patterns of cultural macro-evolution and the
emergence of complex technology, this issue troubled me less than Referee 2, but I would ask you to
consider this.
*We have re-looked at this and made some changes to our introduction, inserting some more
explanation as to why we picked technology as an exemplar of ‘culture’.
The most significant issue to consider is made by Referee 2, namely the ancestral state reconstructions -
“the traits are being traced on a tree as though the tree was independent of the traits, whereas in fact
the tree itself was generated by those traits in the first place”. This is I am afraid outside my area of
expertise, however Referee 2 suggests two alternative solutions - either (i) justification in the text of
your approach or (ii) inferring ancestral states and the tree simultaneously, during the MCMC analysis.
The latter requires more work, but would seem to me to be the most desirable route, although like
Referee 2, I leave the decision to you. Similarly I leave the decision to you whether you also want to
consider display this as a consensus network - as also noted by Referee 2.
*See our response below to Referee 2’s comments.
Referee 1 Mike O’Brien
This is another in a line of publications by Buckley and Boudot on the evolutionary history of weaving.
It’s important to point out that I said “evolutionary history” as opposed to simply “history.” There is a
huge distinction between the two. The second is important, but it simply chronicles a sequence of
technological events—what came before/after what—but the first goes a step further and attempts to
demonstrate what actually produced what as opposed to simply one thing preceding another in time.
Biologists have long understood the difference and in the 1960s began developing methods to track the
evolutionary (phylogenetic) history of biological lineages. Anthropologists and archaeologists began
paying attention to these beginning in the late 1990s and have made huge inroads into understanding
the evolutionary history of language, customs, and a wide variety of tools. Buckley and Boudot have
focused on weaving in eastern and Southeast Asia, similar to the work of Jamie Tehrani and colleagues.
I have a number of comments on the presentation, but I should state at the start that none of them
sinks the paper. For the most part, the comments are suggestions for strengthening the argument or
clearing up mistakes. Many of the comments appear directly on the manuscript itself, which I am
uploading, so I won’t bother repeating them here.
• Page 2 — I have an issue with the first paragraph of the introduction. The authors state that few
studies have succeeded in connecting microlevel processes and broad-scale patterns. First, that’s simply
not true, and second, that’s like berating geneticists with not understanding all the population-genetics
patterns out there. They’re two different things, usually worked on sequentially and often by different
groups of scientists. The authors make it sound as if only they have finally cracked the nut. Not true.
*Agreed – accordingly we have deleted the sentence that the reviewer objected to, which began “few
studies have succeeded …”.
• Page 3 — The five questions they pose are excellent.
• Page 8 — The paragraph that starts “Most of the focus of recent work” is key to the arguments that all
of us who do cultural phylogenetics make: There is horizontal transmission is culture. Critics make it
sound as if that fact undermines attempts to use phylogenetic methods, but they overlook the fact that
the natural world is replete with examples of introgression (interbreeding among species and the
production of viable offspring). This fact, however, has not led to biologists and paleontologists throwing
up their hands in despair. Rather, they acknowledge the issue and figure out how to deal with it. Buckley
and Boudot do the same.
• Page 9 — In the first paragraph the authors note that they’re using the retention index (RI) but don’t
say why. The RI measures the fit of characters to a rooted cladogram (phylogenetic tree), whereas
another common measure, the consistency index (CI) measures the amount of homoplasy in a data set.
As we know, there are several potential drawbacks to the consistency index, one of which is that the CI
value is not independent of the number of taxa. When the number of taxa increases, the CI value will
decrease. This makes it less ideal than the RI. The authors, of course, know this; I think they should
spell it out for readers who will not know what these measures are and why the authors used the RI.
*Agreed – we have inserted some explanation of our choice of RI in Section 6 along the lines that the
reviewer has suggested.
• Page 9 — After reading the second paragraph, it occurred to me that the authors could have carried
out a network analysis as a companion to their tree. I’m not saying they should in this paper, but I think
it would/might help to resolve relationships.
*We considered including this (a Neighbornet plot of the data) but decided that since it reproduced the
same clusterings as the Bayesian consensus tree, it did not add significantly to the arguments in the
paper.
• Page 9 — In paragraph 4, the reference [14] is wrong
*Noted and corrected
• Page 10 — Great discussion in the paragraph that starts “Despite the fact that a phylogenetic model . .
. .” This is a key point.
• Page 11 —In the top line, I don’t think they mean “homologous.” If something is independently
invented but appears in only one descendant, it’s apomorphic, but it’s not “homologous.”
*Noted and corrected
• Page 12 — In paragraph 2 the authors are talking about repetition and encoding “blocks” of
information. I think the authors would benefit from reading an article by Richard Pocklington and Michael
L. Best: “Cultural evolution and units of selection in replicating text.” Journal of Theoretical Biology 188:
79–87.
*Thanks for drawing our attention to this interesting paper. We have inserted a new paragraph
discussing the issues raised.
• Excellent figures.
In summary, I think this paper makes an excellent addition to the literature on phylogenetic analyses of
cultural phenomena in general and to the evolutionary history of weaving in Asia. As the authors point
out in their abstract, there is enough detail and resolution in their results to help us critique standard
models and assumptions that have been advanced to describe the evolution of culture.
Referee 2
This paper brings new data and insights into the long-term transmission of technologies and traditions.
As a case study it is impressive in scope and likely to be of interest to a variety of researchers in
different disciplines, including archaeologists, anthropologists, and evolutionary biologists. The methods
are appropriate and the analyses are generally well executed, although there are some aspects which in
my opinion require further attention. I also feel that some of the literature review and discussion would
benefit from being more focused.
Comments & Suggestions:
Title: Too vague and needs to be more specific/informative – e.g. 'The evolution of an ancient
technology: a phylogenetic analysis of Asian loom weaving'
*We think that our original title, which is short and memorable, works well enough, particularly as there
is a lot in the paper and it’s not possible to summarize it all in the title.
Section 1: Introduction:
The aims of the study seem slightly confused (or at least, I found them confusing as a reader). The
introduction (particularly top of page 3) suggests the main research question concerns the emergence of
complex technology, but most of the paper seems to focus on the relationship between modes of
cultural learning and patterns of cultural macro-evolution. Although the two are not unrelated, the link is
not articulated very clearly and the appeal to the cumulative cultural evolution literature is somewhat
unconvincing and patchy (for instance, the paper does not address major hypotheses concerning the
development of complex technological traditions, such as demographic factors or social learning
strategies like copy-successful individuals). I would suggest refocusing the aims of the paper around the
first issue (micro- and macro- cultural transmission), which is the one that this study can a significant
contribution to.
*As noted, we have revised our introductory section somewhat to make it clear why we have selected
technology as the focus of our research, and how this can reveal the patterns of cultural evolution that
the reviewer mentions.
p.2: "relatively few studies have succeeding in connecting these aspects [micro and macro
transmission". These studies should be cited.
*We removed this sentence from the introduction (since Reviewer 1 strongly objected to it). We have
inserted more discussion in Section 7 of the Tehrani and Collard paper, which is perhaps most relevant
to our work.
p. 2 & p. 5: The phrase "where [weaving information] resides" is a bit vague. In what sense does
knowledge reside somewhere other than the brain? Maybe "distributed" would be a better term.
*Our use of the term “information” rather than “knowledge” is a deliberate choice. Some types of
information, such as the information embodied in fibre plant species modified by domestication, do not
reside in the brain and are not “knowledge”.
Section 3. It would be useful to separate out the area surveys from the second-hand summaries of craft
transmission taken from the literature. The results of the former could be presented in a table showing
the modes of transmission for various components (or for the 4 categories of knowledge given on page
7).
*Agreed - we have adopted this suggestion, and have separated out the area surveys information and
inserted it in the main text (Section 3) in the form of a table (Table 1, appears at the end of the ms) as
the reviewer suggests.
Section 5 (and ESM): Phylogenetic analyses:
The description of Bayesian phylogenetic methods in the ESM is not very accurate. It should explain that
the MCMC analysis samples trees at regular intervals to generate a posterior distribution of trees
(sampled in proportion to their probability). The posterior distribution of trees is then used to calculate
(posterior) support for individual clades, integrating uncertainty over tree topologies and model
parameters.
*Agreed. We have inserted what we hope is a more accurate description in the main text (Section 6)
and in the ESM according to the reviewer’s suggestions.
From what I can tell, the output of the Bayesian analysis (the tree file) was summarised as a consensus
tree, not a consensus network (as implemented in programs like SplitsTree to show conflicting
relationships – which won't be apparent at the 70% level).
*True, but this is not the main way in which we detect conflicting relationships. These were detected by
identifying characters that are shared by lineages that are geographic neighbours, but phylogenetically
distant, as discussed in our text (Section 6).
Ancestral state reconstructions:
There is a bit of an issue with these analyses in that the traits are being traced on a tree as though the
tree was independent of the traits, whereas in fact the tree itself was generated by those traits in the
first place (based on a previously assumed set of ancestral states, rates of evolutionary change, etc. –
which are now being re-estimated but on a fixed tree topology). Usually, this kind of analysis would
trace traits on an independent tree. For instance, a behavioural trait might be reconstructed on a genetic
tree, or a cultural trait on a language tree. I think that the approach taken here would require some kind
of justification in the text, e.g. the authors might point out that for these data there is no viable
"independent tree" (such as a language tree, or mtDNA tree which might be a good model for a
maternally transmitted cultural tradition). Alternatively, I would suggest inferring ancestral states and
the tree simultaneously, during the MCMC analysis. This can be done using the "report ancestral states"
command in MrBayes. It is rather laborious, since it can only be done one node at a time, but would at
least work around the problem of non-independence, and also have the virtue of integrating uncertainty
across model parameters and tree topologies (whereas the current analysis employs a single model and
one consensus tree). If the authors do adopt this approach (which I really think would be more rigorous)
it might make sense to target a few specific nodes of particular interest, rather than doing every single
node in the tree, which would take a very long time.
*The reviewer is correct, in the strict sense, however the reconstructions that we have presented are
good approximations, since they are well-resolved (most have probabilities of 0 or 1), and they fit with
what we would deduce intuitively by inspecting the present-day looms and looking for common features
that derive from ancestral looms. We have inserted comments to this effect in the ESM. On a practical
point, if we did the analysis the way the reviewer suggests, it would take a very long time indeed (one
MCMC run on our datafile takes about 2 days of computing time, to do 10 nodes this way would take
about 1 month of computing and data collation).
How were the graphical representations of gains and losses on the tree rendered? Was some kind of
software used?
*These were done “by hand”. There’s no software available that will make this kind of plot, as far as we
know.
The interpretation of node support values (ESM):
I think this section is misleading. Even under pure vertical transmission you would expect posterior
support values below 100% due to convergence, parallelism, etc. It would not only be due to missing
data or noise. By the same token, in this dataset values below 100% should not be interpreted solely as
evidence of horizontal transmission, which is only one source of homoplasy in cultural evolution.
*Agreed. We have modified this discussion in the ESM to acknowledge the possibility of causes other
than horizontal transmission.
Correlation with societal complexity:
This analysis is problematic as it does not control for phylogenetic (or spatial) autocorrelation. This
seems important, given the strong phylogenetic signal in the assemblages. In the circumstances, think
the analysis would have to be re-done to control for historical relatedness, or excluded from the paper.
Given that societal complexity seems somewhat tangential to the main focus of the paper, the latter
may be the more straightforward option.
*We disagree. We think that the correlation of loom complexity with societal complexity stands as a
valid observation. We have taken care to point out that it does not prove a causal connection, and we
hope that it may stimulate future work to establish whether such a connection exists (or not).
Section 7 Discussion
7.3 (p. 14): Transmission within versus between communities
It would be worth discussing Tehrani & Collard's 2009 study on inter- versus intra- group cultural
transmission here. That study (which is cited in the references) focused on the same issues as those
addressed in this paper and was similarly concerned with weaving technologies. Moreover, it highlights
the importance of factors like marriage patterns and modes of learning that are also clearly relevant to
this study. These parallels suggest that there are some general principles of cultural evolution that are
worth commenting on.
*Agreed. We have inserted some discussion of Tehrani and Collard’s findings in this section.
ESM:
In Section 3.4 of the ESM where the sources are described, why are Mexican weavers included? If the
scope of the review extends beyond SE Asia, then why not include other studies too (e.g. loom weavers
of Central Asia, Iran, Europe, etc.)?
*Agreed. We have revised the discussion in the ESM to focus mainly on East Asia (our study region),
with some additional remarks on the similarity in findings from studies in other regions.
