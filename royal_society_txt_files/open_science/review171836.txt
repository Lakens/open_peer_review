This manuscript investigates the dynamic mechanism of quadrupedal locomotion in
chimpanzees using a musculoskeletal model. The authors achieved quadrupedal gait by forward
dynamic simulations using the optimization with two criteria regarding stability and energy
efficiency. They discuss about the roles of the two criteria based on the simulation results.
This manuscript is concisely organized and easy to read. The modeling study with a
sophisticated musculoskeletal model is useful to understand dynamic mechanism of chimpanzee
locomotion. However, there are some issues.
Major comments
1. "stability" used in this manuscript seems invalid. Because animal walking is dynamic and
periodic, stability generally means dynamic stability especially in modeling studies, which is
mathematically defined, for example, using eigenvalues for perturbations and basin of attraction
of state variable. However, the authors seem to use "stability" in a way that it explains the
magnitude of lateral movements (for example, the gait becomes more "stable" as the lateral
movement decreases). I think that the authors use "stability" as static stability because small
lateral movements inhibit the center of mass from going out of the support polygon.
Dynamic stability and static stability are different. The authors should clarify which stability the
authors mean.
2. The simulation results show that the relative phase between the ipsilateral limbs is about 0.2 or
0.8 for no limit. This is close to pace gait, but there are 0.2 of the relative phase from 0 or 1.
Therefore, each limb moves separately and the gait is walk. This gait is partly static, because duty
factors are almost 0.5.
In contrast, the lateral velocity limit resulted in almost 0.5 of the relative phase. This means that
diagonal limbs move almost simultaneously and suggests trot gait. This gait is not static but
dynamic, because duty factors remain almost 0.5. Therefore, the lateral velocity limit changed
from static to dynamic gait. Related to the above comment, when the authors mean static stability
for the lateral limit, this result is opposite.
3. Dual-objective optimization. The optimization calculation seems to focus only on the cost of
transport. The magnitude of lateral movement is just constraint condition in the optimization. I
wonder if this is dual-objective optimization and why the authors did not use the linear
combination of these two factors for the optimization criteria.
4. The simulation results show that the limitation of the lateral movement increased the cost of
transport. It is unclear what mechanism works for this trend.
From the definition, the cost of transport depends on the forward locomotion distance. The
limitation of the lateral movements allows the energy to be focused on the forward movement.
Why this did not reduce the cost? As discussed in the discussion section, did lateral sway
pendulum mechanism contribute to the low cost? (That is, lateral sway movement contributes to
increase the forward velocity?) If the simulation results are valid, why chimpanzees do not use
large lateral movements in locomotion?
5. The simulation results are not well compared with measured data in chimpanzee locomotion.
Comparison of locomotion factors, such as trunk movements, joint movements, forward and
3
lateral velocities, gait cycle duration, and duty factors, must be useful to evaluate the validity of
the simulation.

In addition to the trunk movement and joint kinematics, the simulation results, such as forward

Figures 6C, D show the relative phase of the hindlimb and forelimb of the left side. How about
the relative phases between the left and right limbs? 0.5?

"improve the match between the simulated gait and the experimentally recorded gait" It is
unclear which data show this?
L241
"our results show very little effect of footfall sequence on any of the measured gait parameters"
This is unclear. Figures 6C and D show a large difference of the footfall sequence between No
limit and <0.1., which induces large differences in locomotion parameters, such as the lateral
velocity.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors present the results of a simulation study using a chimpanzee musculoskeletal model.
Based on the gait simulations and constraints used, they conclude that adding lateral stability as
constraint has an important effect on the energetic costs of the simulated gait. In addition, adding
stability as criterion also affects the footfall patterns (diagonal vs. lateral). The authors suggest
caution for the use of single optimization goals in gait simulations.
I think the paper is certainly valuable for publication in the Royal Society open Science because of
the highly interesting data that is made available (chimp model, scripts, gait simulations). I think
this will give the possibility to other researchers to continue on this route and further improve the
model and the simulations, eventually reaching more realistic, and therefore meaningful,
simulations of chimpanzee gait.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Monica Daley):
Your manuscript on the simulation of chimpanzee locomotion has been reviewed by two experts.
While they are positive overall about the contribution, they do raise a number of concerns about
the presentation and interpretation of the model that require revisions. In particular, the authors
should address Reviewer 1’s concerns about the nature of the stability criterion and whether the
approach is truly ‘dual-objective’ or a static-stability-constrained single objective optimization.
It would also help if the authors could provide a bit more detailed and critical discussion of the
current simplifications and limitations of the model, and how the findings might differ if the
model were made more realistic. For example, could you get a similarly better match between
model and data by adding trunk flexibility to the model, rather than adding a stability constraint
7
to the simulations? If so, how should the field proceed in deciding how much and which features
of biological realism are necessary and adequate to explain animal gait? A critical discussion of
these issues would be useful.

"stability" used in this manuscript seems invalid. Because animal walking is dynamic and

thematically defined, for example, using eigenvalues for perturbations and basin of attraction of
e variable. However, the authors seem to use "stability" in a way that it explains the magnitude
ateral movements (for example, the gait becomes more "stable" as the lateral movement
reases). I think that the authors use "stability" as static stability because small lateral
vements inhibit the center of mass from going out of the support polygon.
namic stability and static stability are different. The authors should clarify which stability the
hors mean.
apologise for the confusion here. The referee is absolutely correct that the term ‘stability’ is
biguous, and has a large number of different uses in the scientific literature. Certainly structural
Lyapunov stability are commonly what is meant in the biomechanical literature, but in fact
tmill (2002, 2005) is actually referring to what he calls ‘balance’, and what would probably be
re generally called ‘lateral stability’. This is actually a very important point so we have added an
itional paragraph to the introduction where we discuss the various differences between the
s of the term ‘stability’ and make it much clearer what we are using the term to mean in this
er (lateral stability).
he simulation results show that the relative phase between the ipsilateral limbs is about 0.2 or
for no limit. This is close to pace gait, but there are 0.2 of the relative phase from 0 or 1.
refore, each limb moves separately and the gait is walk. This gait is partly static, because duty
ors are almost 0.5.
ontrast, the lateral velocity limit resulted in almost 0.5 of the relative phase. This means that
gonal limbs move almost simultaneously and suggests trot gait. This gait is not static but
amic, because duty factors remain almost 0.5. Therefore, the lateral velocity limit changed from
ic to dynamic gait. Related to the above comment, when the authors mean static stability for
lateral limit, this result is opposite.
pointed out in the previous comment, we absolutely agree that if we were referring to static and
amic stability then our explanation would be incorrect. However in terms of lateral stability, the
of highly diagonal gaits reduces the rolling moments, and hence increases this measure of
bility. We have changed all uses of the word ‘stability’ to specifically refer to the type of stability
ng discussed to make this much clearer.
Dual-objective optimization. The optimization calculation seems to focus only on the cost of
sport. The magnitude of lateral movement is just constraint condition in the optimization. I
nder if this is dual-objective optimization and why the authors did not use the linear combination
hese two factors for the optimization criteria.
imising (or searching) for solutions that can cope with multiple constraints is a very active
earch area (Cui, 2017). We have in the past used approaches where we create a single metric
a linear sum of various modelling parameters (in this case distance and energy (Sellers 2002))
it simply does not always work as expected. The importance of modelling parameters is often
y non-linear (so a particular parameter may have very little importance until it approaches a
shold such as we found in our T. rex running model that evaluated skeletal loading (Sellers
7)). GaitSym is actually extremely flexible in terms of generating fitness values but ultimately
re are almost an infinite number of possibilities for how multi-objective optimisation can be
ieved. We have added some extra sentences in the introduction where we discuss these issues.
almost certainly the case that there are better ways of achieving these goals, but the approach
wn does work which is primary goal of the paper.
The simulation results show that the limitation of the lateral movement increased the cost of
sport. It is unclear what mechanism works for this trend.
m the definition, the cost of transport depends on the forward locomotion distance. The
tation of the lateral movements allows the energy to be focused on the forward movement. Why
did not reduce the cost? As discussed in the discussion section, did lateral sway pendulum
chanism contribute to the low cost? (That is, lateral sway movement contributes to increase the
ward velocity?) If the simulation results are valid, why chimpanzees do not use large lateral
vements in locomotion?
main conclusion of the paper is that chimpanzees (and probably most animals) are not
imising the cost of locomotion, but have a complex set of goals and constraints that they need
ccommodate such that cost of locomotion is traded off against some other desired outcome. I
k at this stage we can only speculate what the mechanisms are that might control this, and an
ra sentence has been put in the discussion to make this clear.
The simulation results are not well compared with measured data in chimpanzee locomotion.
mparison of locomotion factors, such as trunk movements, joint movements, forward and lateral
ocities, gait cycle duration, and duty factors, must be useful to evaluate the validity of the

have not done this simply because this sort of comparison is the main focus of the previous
er we published modelling chimpanzee gait. Most of these parameters have been set in the
del to match experimentally derived data (which for chimpanzees is highly variable, see
Aout, 2004 })), and it is really only trunk movements, gait cycles, duty factors and phase angles
t are allowed to vary. The values generated by the models are reported in figures 5 and 6 (along

mments to the Author(s)
authors present the results of a simulation study using a chimpanzee musculoskeletal model.
ed on the gait simulations and constraints used, they conclude that adding lateral stability as
straint has an important effect on the energetic costs of the simulated gait. In addition, adding
bility as criterion also affects the footfall patterns (diagonal vs. lateral). The authors suggest
tion for the use of single optimization goals in gait simulations.
ink the paper is certainly valuable for publication in the Royal Society open Science because of
highly interesting data that is made available (chimp model, scripts, gait simulations). I think
will give the possibility to other researchers to continue on this route and further improve the
del and the simulations, eventually reaching more realistic, and therefore meaningful,
ulations of chimpanzee gait.
