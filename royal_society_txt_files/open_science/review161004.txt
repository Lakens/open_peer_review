Please provide more details for the methodology. You mention the surface of the bone was
removed. How was it removed? Were the bones UV-ed before hand, or bleached?
Furthermore, the estimation of the age at death for the adult bones needs clarification. The
method used for such estimation has never been good, and therefore, we would like to see more
characterization and caution on the estimation in the text. The age estimate of subadults is
satisfactory, as the teeth eruption is a lot more precise. Given that this manuscript relies heavily
on the estimation of age, it seems that the methodology to estimate said age is sloppy.
In all, I think this is an exciting manuscript and should be published, but the revisions above are
absolutely necessary.

This is an interesting paper from Sawafuji et al. that profiles the proteomics from six human
individuals from Edo, Japan that are ~500 years old. They are able to detect a large number of
proteins for all of the individuals; however, protein lists are not provided, so it is unclear exactly
which ones are detected. Additionally, I consider it a requirement for publication to make all of
the RAW data available online in a repository (massIVE, ProteomeXchange, etc) allowing for
future follow up studies on this dataset.
Specific comments:
Introduction:
Page 2, Line 22: ‘immunological methods lack accuracy’ I don't think accuracy is the correct word
here. Antibodies remain accurate despite degraded samples (unless the epitope is lost), they may
not provide species specificity, but they still provide basic presence/absence regardless. Please
revise.
3
Page 2, Line 24: ‘immunological methods cannot be applied to multiple proteins simultaneously’
This isn't entirely true, multiple labeling is a fairly standard method in modern immuno work. It
isn't shotgun proteomics level diverse, but multiple are definitely possible. Please revise.
For both of the above comments, I do not think this paragraph is really necessary for the paper
and adds nothing to the main take home of paleoproteomics. It may be best just to remove it
completely.
Page 2, Line 34: ‘this method has also been applied to ancient remains.’ Add citations here.
Page 2, Line 37: ‘Sine then the method…’ This section is very incomplete. The first LC-MS applied
to archaeological/paleontological remains was in 'Schweitzer, M.; Hill, C. L.; Asara, J. M.; Lane,
W. S.; Pincus, S. H., Identification of Immunoreactive Material in Mammoth Fossils. Journal of
Molecular Evolution 2002, 55 (6), 696-705.' Capellini et al., 2012 detected the most proteins, but
since then there have been a number of other studies that you don't have cited here including:
Cleland, T. P.; Schroeter, E. R.; Schweitzer, M. H., Biologically and diagenetically derived peptide
modifications in moa collagens. Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 2015, 282
(1808).

Castoroides ohioensis skull and the utility of old museum collections for palaeoproteomics.

protein survival in ancient bone. Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry 2014, 28 (6), 605-
615.
among others.
Page 2, Line 42: ‘till date’ should be ‘to date’
2.2 Protein sample preparation
Page 3, Line 56: How were the samples ground? How was the grinding device cleaned between
samples?
Page 4, Line 18: Please explain why the samples were smashed with a pestle. Additionally, how
were the pestles cleaned between samples?
Page 4, Line 20: ‘Samples were heated…’ Were supernatants removed from the residual bone
powder? If so, what were the centrifugation parameters?
Page 4: ‘Peptide mixtures…’ Please give the full LC-MS/MS method that was used in this study
not just the citation. If space is a concern add the full method in the supplementary materials and
reference it there.
2.3 Data analysis
When was the human reference proteome downloaded?
Page 4, Line 46 and throughout: Use the protein name not the gene name, if you use the gene
name, the protein name must be used first followed by the gene name in parentheses (e.g., ALB
should be serum albumin (ALB)). Additionally, why was albumin included when it is one of the
most common lab contaminants? How were the HSA peptides differentiated from the BSA
peptides. Correct throughout the manuscript in reference to ALB.
Page 4, Line 48: Why did you include oxidation P and hydroxyproline? These are the same thing
by mass, so was unnecessary.
4
Page 5: ‘The deamidation rate…’ How were PSMs differentiated between deamidation and 13C
DDA selected peaks? Would this change your deamidation percentage? Additionally, this isn't a
rate, this is a deamidation level, correct throughout.
Page 5 ‘In order to compare…’ Why was emPAI used instead of other quantification methods
provided by MaxQuant? Make it clear here.
What statistics package was used to determine the Pearson correlation and Bonferroni correction?
3.1 The authenticity of the proteomic data
Page 6 line 53-57: Is there something inherent to the col1a1 that makes it more likely to have more
peptides than col1a2 such as additional arginines and lysines?
Page 7, Line 11: I don't really see how you can say anything about peptide number reflecting
extant bone composition? Did you perform an extant control experiment to do this correlation?
You haven't measured the amount of collagen I in these samples.
3.2 Proteins detected from archeological human bones
Page 7, line 37: Please explain how you separate elderly from adult.
Additionally, please add supplementary tables with all of the proteins detected.
3.5 Protein quantification using emPAI
Please include all graphs of proteins discussed in the supplementary.
Page 10 ‘in this study, APOA1 was detected only in the youngest infant (0.75 years old), which is
consistent with the previous research’ Add a citation here.
4.1 The presence of leukocyte-derived proteins
Page 11, Line 55: ‘These proteins have not been…’ Please investigate more of the literature in
relation to this, while it is likely WBC derived proteins have not been previously reported, only
citing two coauthor papers and one additional paper that focuses on collagen I glycosylation is
probably inappropriate.
Page 12, line 12: ‘These proteins were possibly derived from red bone marrow in the rib samples.’
If you did not sample the medullary cavity in your samples, then this hypothesis is incorrect.
Where on the bone did you sample for each individual (please add to the sampling section)? If
not from the medullary cavity, then what other reasons would you expect to see these proteins?
Page 14, Line 42-50: While Wilson et al and Quelch et al support your statement here, are there
any more recent references to support this? Both of these are very old and may not reflect the
current understanding of extant bone proteomics.
Page 15, Line 8: Like the above two references, this one is fairly old. Do you have a more recent
example?
Page 15, Line 19: Reference 60 is very old. Is there a more recent review about fetuin?
4.3 Insights of proteomics analysis in archeological human bone and future perspective
Page 16, Line 25: Please revise the reference to bone marrow. As mentioned above, unless you
sampled the medullary cavity this is a big assumption.
Page 17, Line 8-10: ‘If we combine…’ I think this statement is dubious at best. Absence of
evidence in a DDA experiment does not preclude older individuals from having these proteins,
just that they weren’t detected here. Please revise.

This nice brief and to the point paper proteomic data from ancient humans shows age related
changes to the proteome and the possibility of infectious disease. I see no major issues with this
paper and recommend that it be published after minor revision. Even with the advent of the
Human Proteome Project and similar efforts we are far from being able to completely understand
and utilize information on gene expression and transcriptomics in modern humans. Some goals
are to evaluate metabolic differences between tissues or cell lines and, of course, localizing the
cellular and sub cellular location of pharmacological targets. But even in recent studies of the
human proteome, there is often an emphasis on genes rather than proteins. The paper by
Sawafuji et al. describes a portion of the proteome derived from the analysis of ancient human rib
bones. By interrogating reporting explicitly on the proteome they make commentary on changes
among age groups and the disease state of the subjects and analyzed. They have made headway
in ancient proteomics by addressing one of the objectives that we mentioned at the advent of
“paleoproteomics” and identifying multiple bone proteins that have not previously been studied
in ancient remains.
One might comment on the sample size (less than 10). This, in and of itself, is not an issue. The
amount of data derived from a single sample is enormous. However, it's a bit more problematic
when you want to take a small sample of ancient bones of different periods and then make
comparison based on sex and age of the individual. The approach I might suggest would be to
include the age (years AD) in Table 1 to clearly show that all the bones are not from the same time
period and emphasizing the issue. I would also suggest caution in wording but, overall, the
authors have been fair, i.e. they are not making absolute conclusions. They might add a sentence
6
to the discussion or conclusions indicating that even though the sample size is small the data are
consistent with previous findings and expectations (the latter is done but former is not).
Other suggestions include some clarification of a few sentences and a suggestion for the figures.
The first paragraph of section 3.1 (page 40 line 14-35) is descriptive and does not offer results.
Could this information be placed in the introduction or discussion?
String network: provide a better figure legend. I was wondering what subset of proteins were
described. For example, some of the neutrophil related proteins described on page 8, line 48-43
do not appear in this network.
Page 47 line 52: There seems to be an issue with sentence structure here, particularly with the use
of respectively. Please review the sentence.
I found the figures in the supplementary documents more compelling than figure 2 and 3.
Consider placing figs 2,3 in the supplemental docs and describing the results in the text . Then
one of the bar charts could be used in the document. Or make a multi-panel figure from figures 1,
2 and 3– they are all related and simple enough to combine in a multi-panel figure. This affords
more room for other figures to come in from the suppl. docs.

ease provide more details for the methodology. You mention the surface of the bone was removed.
was it removed? Were the bones UV-ed before hand, or bleached?
reply;
added some description in Materials and Methods section following the reviewer's advice.
rthermore, the estimation of the age at death for the adult bones needs clarification. The method
for such estimation has never been good, and therefore, we would like to see more
acterization and caution on the estimation in the text. The age estimate of subadults is
factory, as the teeth eruption is a lot more precise. Given that this manuscript relies heavily on
estimation of age, it seems that the methodology to estimate said age is sloppy.
reply;
thank the reviewer for pointing our inadequate description.
aoka and Hirata (2007) had reported the sex and age at death of the adult skeletons used in this
y [Reference 21], where sex was determined by the sexual dimorphism of the pelvis and age at
h were estimated by the observation of the auricular surface of the ilium using the method of
kberry and Chamberlain (2002).
ording to the reviewer's comments, we added some sentences about it.
ll, I think this is an exciting manuscript and should be published, but the revisions above are

is an interesting paper from Sawafuji et al. that profiles the proteomics from six human
viduals from Edo, Japan that are ~500 years old. They are able to detect a large number of
eins for all of the individuals;
wever, protein lists are not provided, so it is unclear exactly which ones are detected.
reply;
ording to the reviewer's comments, we provided protein lists as dataset of supplementary
rmation.
ditionally, I consider it a requirement for publication to make all of the RAW data available
ne in a repository (massIVE, ProteomeXchange, etc) allowing for future follow up studies on this
set.
reply;
mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium
the PRIDE partner repository. We will make it freely available after acceptance of this paper, but
one must use Username (reviewer75188@ebi.ac.uk) and Password (EFTV2DUW).
cific comments:
oduction:
ge 2, Line 22: ‘immunological methods lack accuracy’ I don't think accuracy is the correct word
. Antibodies remain accurate despite degraded samples (unless the epitope is lost), they may not
ide species specificity, but they still provide basic presence/absence regardless. Please revise.
ge 2, Line 24: ‘immunological methods cannot be applied to multiple proteins simultaneously’
isn't entirely true, multiple labeling is a fairly standard method in modern immuno work. It isn't
gun proteomics level diverse, but multiple are definitely possible. Please revise.
r both of the above comments, I do not think this paragraph is really necessary for the paper and
s nothing to the main take home of paleoproteomics. It may be best just to remove it completely.
reply;
ording to the reviewer's suggestions, we removed these sentences.
ge 2, Line 34: ‘this method has also been applied to ancient remains.’ Add citations here.
reply;
ording to the reviewer's comments, we added citations.

ording to the reviewer's comments, we revised the sentence and added citations.

reply;
ording to the reviewer's comment, we revised.
Protein sample preparation
ge 3, Line 56: How were the samples ground? How was the grinding device cleaned between
ples?
reply;
e sample were wrapped in clean aluminium foil and were fragmented using a hammer that was
ned with bleach, as described in the previous paper (Enrico et al., 2012).
ording to the reviewer's comment, we added some description in Materials and Methods section.
ge 4, Line 18: Please explain why the samples were smashed with a pestle. Additionally, how
e the pestles cleaned between samples?
reply;
as for grinding the samples more thoroughly, because using only hammer could not grinding
m completely. We used disposable pestles, so each pestle was discarded after use.
ge 4, Line 20: ‘Samples were heated…’ Were supernatants removed from the residual bone
der? If so, what were the centrifugation parameters?
reply;
we did not remove the supernatants at this stage. Before purification of tryptic peptides using
stage tips, we removed the precipitation with centrifugation at 14,000 g for 10 min.
ge 4: ‘Peptide mixtures…’ Please give the full LC-MS/MS method that was used in this study
just the citation. If space is a concern add the full method in the supplementary materials and
rence it there.
reply;
ording to the reviewer's comment, we added the details in the text.
Data analysis
hen was the human reference proteome downloaded?
reply;
had downloaded it on December 13, 2015, and added some description about it in the text.
ge 4, Line 46 and throughout: Use the protein name not the gene name, if you use the gene name,
protein name must be used first followed by the gene name in parentheses (e.g., ALB should be
m albumin (ALB)).
reply;
defined all the abbreviations at their first mention in the text, and used them. For example, ALB
defined in the first paragraph of Introduction section (Page 2, Line 5).
ditionally, why was albumin included when it is one of the most common lab contaminants?
were the HSA peptides differentiated from the BSA peptides. Correct throughout the
uscript in reference to ALB.
reply;
thank the reviewer’s instructive comment. That is an important point and we were concerned
ut it. But sequences of HAS and BSA differs enough to distinguish each other. The identities of
e two sequences are 465/609 (76.4%), and it is rather difficult to find peptides that are the same
een human and bovine. Indeed, all but one peptides we detected as ALB in this study were the
e sequence as human, but not bovine (The one peptide sequence is the same between human and
ine because of its short length as 7 amino acid residues). HSA is major protein in blood, so it is
wonder that we detected HSA from bone including blood and bone marrow. In this study, there
e correlation between age and the level of ALB (see Table 2), which also supports our idea that
ost all peptides identified as ALB were derived from HSA.
ious studies also include ALB to the analysis (Cappellini et al., 2012; Buckley et al., 2014;
ker et al., 2016). So we decided that we included ALB to further analysis because it may result in
er description of bone proteomics data, compared with the analysis without ALB.
revised some sentences in the manuscript to make it clear.

ge 4, Line 48: Why did you include oxidation P and hydroxyproline? These are the same thing by

reply;
thank the reviewer and made correction.
ge 5: ‘The deamidation rate…’ How were PSMs differentiated between deamidation and 13C
A selected peaks? Would this change your deamidation percentage? Additionally, this isn't a rate,
is a deamidation level, correct throughout.
reply;
revised the sentences by adding the detail in the manuscript as follows; The mass difference
een the deamidated monoisotopic peak and the 13C peak of the amidated form of the same
ide is 19.34 mDa. Previous studies demonstrated that the use of an orbitrap mass spectrometer
high mass measurement accuracy and high resolving power, like the one used in this study
Exactive HF) and a peptide tolerance value like the we imposed, 5 ppm, enable correct
gnment of deamidated peptides (Nepomuceno et al., 2014)
ge 5 ‘In order to compare…’ Why was emPAI used instead of other quantification methods
ided by MaxQuant? Make it clear here.
reply;
tried other indexes like MaxLFQ and iBAQ that are intensity-based method, but there were no
ificant correlations between the level of COL1A1 and that of COL1A2, and levels of COL1A2
e even higher than that of COL1A1 in some samples. Considering the composition of collagen,
judged that these indexes didn’t reflect the composition of bone proteomics. On the other hand,
n using emPAI, which is index based on the number of unique peptide, there was significant
elation between the level of COL1A1 and that of COL1A2. This index was also used in modern
e proteomics (Alves et al., 2011), so we thought there were advantages of using emPAI over
r indexes.
hat statistics package was used to determine the Pearson correlation and Bonferroni correction?
reply;
used the corr.test and p.adjust functions in R. We added it to the manuscript.
The authenticity of the proteomic data
ge 6 line 53-57: Is there something inherent to the col1a1 that makes it more likely to have more
ides than col1a2 such as additional arginines and lysines?
reply;
calculated the number of all peptides of COL1A1 and COL1A2 by
tideMass(http://web.expasy.org/peptide_mass/). We searched it on the same condition as the
ysis of Maxquant in this study. The number of peptides is 222 in COL1A1 and 212 in COL1A2.
m this result, the proportion is 1:0.954, while the proportion was 1:0.737~0.866 in this study.
suggests that the number of unique peptide in COL1A1 is higher in this study, compared with
proportion of observable peptides of the two proteins. The collagen triple helix is composed of
alpha 1 and one alpha 2 chains. So it may be supposed that our results reflect the composition of
agen, as we mentioned in the Discussion section.
ge 7, Line 11: I don't really see how you can say anything about peptide number reflecting extant
e composition? Did you perform an extant control experiment to do this correlation? You haven't
sured the amount of collagen I in these samples.
reply;
thank the reviewer for insightful comment. We agree that this sentence ("the proteomics data
rately reflect the composition of the modern bone proteome.") is overwhelming. We have not
ormed an extant control experiment, so we could not demonstrate this. But it is also true that
e was a significant correlation between the number of unique COL1A1 peptides and that of
L1A2 peptides, and this indicates that proteins remain the composition of bone at some level. So,
carefully revised the sentences.

Proteins detected from archeological human bones
ge 7, line 37: Please explain how you separate elderly from adult.
reply;
defined "elderly adult" as more than 60 years old (H-24, H-88, H-160, H-162). We added some
anation about it to the Method section (2.1 Human bone samples).
ditionally, please add supplementary tables with all of the proteins detected.
reply;
added the protein lists in the Supplementary.
Protein quantification using emPAI
ease include all graphs of proteins discussed in the supplementary.
reply;
ording to the reviewer's advice, we added the graph in the Supplementary.
-
ge 10 ‘in this study, APOA1 was detected only in the youngest infant (0.75 years old), which is
sistent with the previous research’ Add a citation here.
reply;
e previous research" in this sentence indicates the research that was quoted in one previous
ence ("The expression level of APOA1 in blood..."). So we don't think it is not always necessary,
we added citations again here, according to the reviewer’s comment.

The presence of leukocyte-derived proteins
ge 11, Line 55: ‘These proteins have not been…’ Please investigate more of the literature in
tion to this, while it is likely WBC derived proteins have not been previously reported, only
g two coauthor papers and one additional paper that focuses on collagen I glycosylation is
ably inappropriate.
reply;
ies on shotgun proteomics analysis of archaeological bone are few, but we added some citations
uding archaic hominins (Welker et al., 2016) following the reviewer's suggestion.
ge 12, line 12: ‘These proteins were possibly derived from red bone marrow in the rib samples.’
ou did not sample the medullary cavity in your samples, then this hypothesis is incorrect. Where
he bone did you sample for each individual (please add to the sampling section)? If not from the
ullary cavity, then what other reasons would you expect to see these proteins?
reply;
used whole part of the center of rib, not the edge. The medullary cavity is included in the
pling section, thus we think the hypothesis is appropriate.
ge 14, Line 42-50: While Wilson et al and Quelch et al support your statement here, are there any
e recent references to support this? Both of these are very old and may not reflect the current
erstanding of extant bone proteomics.
reply;
also thought the same thing and searched the more recent references, but unfortunately we
dn't find more recent references. Analysis of age-related changes of protein expression levels in
e seem to have been hardly conducted, perhaps due to ethical problems.
ge 15, Line 8: Like the above two references, this one is fairly old. Do you have a more recent
mple?
reply;
we mentioned above, we couldn't find more recent references.
ge 15, Line 19: Reference 60 is very old. Is there a more recent review about fetuin?
reply;
very old reference (Pedersen, 1944) is the first report of detecting fetuin (AHSG in human),
ch was detected from newly born calf. As one can see from this, this protein expresses most in
born, and it is consistent with the results of this study. We quoted the reference for appealing this
t. The other reference (Robinson et al., 2016) is fairly recent review about fetuin.

Insights of proteomics analysis in archeological human bone and future perspective
ge 16, Line 25: Please revise the reference to bone marrow. As mentioned above, unless you
pled the medullary cavity this is a big assumption.
reply;
we replied for the comment of page 12, line12, we used samples that included the medullary
ty, so this is not the case of your concern.
ge 17, Line 8-10: ‘If we combine…’ I think this statement is dubious at best. Absence of
ence in a DDA experiment does not preclude older individuals from having these proteins, just
they weren’t detected here. Please revise.
reply;
thank the reviewer for crucial comment. What we wanted to state is that we could estimate age
g the relative amount of those proteins, not presence/absence of those proteins. As the reviewer
ted out, just because they are not identified in an experiment it doesn't necessarily mean that
are not there. It could just be so low quantity that we could not identify them.
we removed inappropriate sentences and revised the descriptions pointed out by the reviewer.
gure 1: Please add the number of proteins detected for each circle.
reply;
number of proteins detected for each circle can be calculated by adding the number of proteins
ach region in the circle (e.g. in the case of infant of Fig. 1A, the number of proteins detected:
+33+21+79=262). If we add the number of proteins detected for each circle, the figure will be a
omplicated, so we left it as it was.
pplementary:
all of the GO figures, please enlarge the graphs, they are very tiny and there is plenty of space on
mage to make them larger. The STRING network can also be enlarged.
reply;
ording to the reviewer's advice, we enlarged the figures.
stract:
rect the reference to bone marrow following how the manuscript was changed.
reply;
used samples that included the medullary cavity, which may contain proteins from bone marrow.
we think that this is not the case.

nice brief and to the point paper proteomic data from ancient humans shows age related changes
he proteome and the possibility of infectious disease. I see no major issues with this paper and
mmend that it be published after minor revision. Even with the advent of the Human Proteome
ect and similar efforts we are far from being able to completely understand and utilize
rmation on gene expression and transcriptomics in modern humans.
e goals are to evaluate metabolic differences between tissues or cell lines and, of course,
lizing the cellular and sub cellular location of pharmacological targets. But even in recent studies
he human proteome, there is often an emphasis on genes rather than proteins.
paper by Sawafuji et al. describes a portion of the proteome derived from the analysis of ancient
an rib bones. By interrogating reporting explicitly on the proteome they make commentary on
nges among age groups and the disease state of the subjects and analyzed. They have made
dway in ancient proteomics by addressing one of the objectives that we mentioned at the advent
paleoproteomics” and identifying multiple bone proteins that have not previously been studied in
ent remains.
might comment on the sample size (less than 10). This, in and of itself, is not an issue. The
unt of data derived from a single sample is enormous. However, it's a bit more problematic when
want to take a small sample of ancient bones of different periods and then make comparison
d on sex and age of the individual.
e approach I might suggest would be to include the age (years AD) in Table 1 to clearly show
all the bones are not from the same time period and emphasizing the issue. I would also
gest caution in wording but, overall, the authors have been fair, i.e. they are not making absolute
clusions.
reply;
really thank for the reviewer's insightful comment. It is exactly important point, and we think
we need larger sample size in case of applying to different sites or different periods. In this study,
only dealt with samples from the same site and period, discussed only the results from the
ples, and cared not to make absolute conclusions, as the reviewer mentioned.
for the age (years AD), we are sorry for the obscure description. The age of the all samples is
7-1683 AD, that is very restricted range, compared with that of ordinary archeological sample.
age was determined using information of stratigraphic layers and literatures. The layer from
ch our samples were excavated is between Great fire of Meireki (1657 AD) and fire of Tenna
4 AD). These big fires of Edo city contributed to determining the narrow range for age of the
ples, and we could say that all samples were from the same time period. We added some
ription about it to the text (Materials and Methods section).
ey might add a sentence to the discussion or conclusions indicating that even though the sample
is small the data are consistent with previous findings and expectations (the latter is done but
er is not).
reply;
ording to the reviewer's advice, we added some description in Discussion section.
er suggestions include some clarification of a few sentences and a suggestion for the figures.
e first paragraph of section 3.1 (page 40 line 14-35) is descriptive and does not offer results.
ld this information be placed in the introduction or discussion?
reply;
thank the reviewer for the very precise comment. According to the reviewer's advice, we moved
the top of Discussion section.
ing network: provide a better figure legend. I was wondering what subset of proteins were
ribed. For example, some of the neutrophil related proteins described on page 8, line 48-43 do
appear in this network.
reply;
ording to the reviewer's comments, we corrected the figure legend. We made this STRING
ork using top 30 proteins, so some of the neutrophil related proteins, which are not in top 30,
’t appear in this figure.
ge 47 line 52: There seems to be an issue with sentence structure here, particularly with the use
espectively. Please review the sentence.
reply;
ording to the reviewer's comments, we corrected the sentence.
ound the figures in the supplementary documents more compelling than figure 2 and 3. Consider
ing figs 2,3 in the supplemental docs and describing the results in the text. Then one of the bar
ts could be used in the document. Or make a multi-panel figure from figures 1, 2 and 3– they are
elated and simple enough to combine in a multi-panel figure. This affords more room for other
res to come in from the suppl. docs.
reply;
en the bar charts of GO analysis are used in the main document, they will take too large space.
erwise, the characters of the charts will be too small to read. So, we added a new graph as a main
re for improvement, new Figure 2 showing the percentage of categories of proteins detected in
individual. We think that this figure provides a brief overview of the proteomics analysis of
aeological human bones. With regard to Figures 2 and 3, we combined them as a multi-panel
re (new Figure 3a and 3b) according to the reviewer's suggestions.
