In this work the authors construct asymmetric informationally-complete POVMs (IC-POVMs) by
the operation of Pauli group on appropriate magic states. This has important implications for
universal quantum computation where the set of symmetric IC-POVMs needs to be augmented
with an appropriate magic state. This work also has possible applications to unambiguous
quantum state recovery and quantum contextuality. As such, it is likely to contain results that
will be useful to a specialized readership working in this area. The work seems to be scientifically
valid and is based on earlier work by the authors. As such I think it is likely to be a suitable
candidate for publication. However, I think that the manuscript would benefit from some
rewriting first to make it more accessible to a wider readership and to make the motivation and
outcomes of the work clearer. In particular:
1. The introduction should be rewritten and lengthened to include more context and
motivation for the work. Much of the terminology and notation used in the introduction is
neither clear nor defined. This should be fixed.
2. I think it would be helpful to the reader to include a more explicit definition of a magic
state in the introduction.
3. Some comment should be added as to why dimensions 10 and 11 were not considered.
4. It would be helpful if there was more information on how the states |psi_i> are obtained
in the higher dimensions.
5. I didn’t understand the notation at the start of the 3D section for the permutation
matrices. Why are there only two numbers in the brackets and what do these represent?
With a suitable rewriting of the manuscript to cover the points discussed above I think this
manuscript would be suitable for publication.

that it is not relevant to your work.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days (i.e. by the 10-Aug-2017). If you do not
think you will be able to meet this date please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
4
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-170387)
We thank the referee to the suggested improvements to the manuscript. We took into account all
5 items.
Item 1–2: we added in the introduction “S. Bravyi and A. Kitaev [4] introduced the principle of
magic state distillation: universal quantum computation may be realized thanks to the stabilizer
formalism (Clifford group unitaries, preparations and measurements) and the ability to prepare
an ancilla in an appropriate single qubit mixed state. Following [6, Sec. IIC], in this paper, a non-
stabilizer pure state will be called a magic state”.
Item 3–4: we added the subsection “Higher dimensions. The same method based on eigenstates
of permutation matrices leads to IC-POVMs in dimensions higher than 9. In the next subsection,
we provide details about a 12-dimensional IC-POVM covariant under the two-qubit/qutrit Pauli
group because the associated triple products contain some geometrical structures as it was the
case in lower dimensions”.
Item 5: we added prior to the 3-dim. section “The situation changes as soon as d = 3 with a
wealth of magic states [7] having a potential usefulness for our purpose of defining IC-POVMs.
From now we focus on magic groups generated by two magic permutation gates. ”
Other corrections:
Section “Dimension nine” was partially incorrect in the proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem.
This has been solved.
Mistakes in a figure caption were corrected.
Reference 7 updated.
