Review of Bitcoin’s multiscale bubble history from January 2012 to February 2018
Overall summary
This paper describes the use of the classical log-periodic power law model to analyse speculative
bubbles in Bitcoin markets – itself an emerging topic of independent research interest in finance
and economics. Whilst I have some concerns that more advanced methods are ultimately
possible, e.g. based on extensions of the model given in Appendix B, I think it would be
important to see this group publish their perspective of such an important topic in a good journal
such as this.
Comments on previous revision
I felt that some of the previous reviewer’s comments were a bit too harsh e.g. the application of
speculative bubble models to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency data is now well-established. As is the
application of econophysics models such as this. See for instance Cheah and Fry (2015), Fry and
Cheah (2016) and Fry (2018). Note that these are papers published in mainstream economics and
finance journals – here the publications in the economics journal are particularly noteworthy.
Whilst I am easy-going about whether the authors choose to cite these in a revision the authors
might find Fry and Cheah (2016) useful as a source of references both on previous econophysics
models applied to Bitcoin and the early economics and finance literature on Bitcoin.
A wholesale check of the article references should be performed e.g. the reference by Fantazzini
[10] is already published. Similarly, the article by Glazer et al. has been published in a journal.
Required changes
Some more details of the Lagrange regularisation approach are needed. This seems to me to be a
penalised regression approach with a penalty applied to penalise against choosing a time
window that is too short?
Section 2.1. More explanation is required as to the choice of \epsilon_0 and w. Why were these
numbers chosen?
More explanation is also needed as regards how the short-bubble/long-bubble typology depends
on the stated value of f_t. It is not clear where this comes from. In principle I like this distinction
6
between short-bubbles and long-bubbles but I think this needs to be placed on a firmer
foundation.
I like the idea behind Section 3. This might need a bit better positioning in terms of
(a) Justified as a historical study of Bitcoin the archetypal cryptocurrency and of independent
financial and economic interest in its own right
(b) Similar analyses have already been undertaken before (see e.g. Fry and Cheah, 2016)
There are necessarily some subjective elements here as identified by the previous reviewer but I
don’t think that this is necessarily a problem.
Need to provide a reference for the comment about a Silicon Valley based investor.
I think the orientation of Section 4 is wrong and this section should be replaced with something
more in keeping with the overall aims of the paper. If this paper is for the most part a historical
analysis of Bitcoin then I think this issue of real-time analysis is slightly tangential and out of
place. What I think would be more useful in its place is to include an additional robustness check
of the long and short bubbles identified in Section 3 using a more standard econometric
methodology. Possibly something as simple as a standard event study. I was a little concerned
about how the referee comment about using alternative methods was seemingly casually
dismissed in the original rebuttal. The method of Bai and Perron is implemented in an R package,
Strucchange I think, and might be used to test for a change in the mean or the variance of the log-
returns. However, I suspect a better approach here would be to use a simple event study
methodology applied to the start-date of each of the identified short and long bubbles.
The conclusions section should be shortened and better focussed to the contribution of the paper
– namely a retrospective analysis and typology of historical bitcoin bubbles by somebody whose
work I’ve always admired.
Do check the references as I think there are probably multiple mistakes here. (I realise this may be
harder to get right than in other papers due to the abundance of electronic-only references and
the fast-paced nature of the subject).

Review of Bitcoin’s multiscale bubble history form January 2012 to February 2018
Overall comments
I would be happy to recommend publication of a suitably revised manuscript. I would also like to
acknowledge the efforts of the author team in revising the previous version. However, there are a
small number of minor changes I would like to see first. The main thing here is that I think a
couple of minor changes in writing style would be more in-keeping with a finance paper.
Required changes
Section 2.1
This now reads much more clearly. I think it would be worth just adding a sentence on the
financial interpretation of these parameters. For example, \epsilon_0 accounts for anything up to
a 5 standard deviation event and for a regular financial market that trades 5 days a week w
corresponds to intervals of between 2 weeks to 12 weeks.
Appendix E
I like the Appendix E. However, I think this would be better in the main manuscript e.g. Section
4.3 Additional robustness check. This would give your article more authority in terms of a finance
article. It also seems a shame to have this work hiding at the end of an Appendix.
References
Could you check references 10, 20 and 41 and possibly the remainder. One of the things to point
out here is that SSRN is an online repository rather than an electronic journal and these articles
may be more properly regarded as preprints. Do check though that these articles have not been
formally published in a journal.
Conclusions section
In order to bolster the finance contribution of the paper I think it would be worthwhile to clarify
in the first paragraph of the conclusions section:
• From an academic perspective the study of Bitcoin as the archetypal cryptocurrency is
important from an economic and a finance perspective.
• Approach also adds to econophysics analyses of the area that have been conducted before
13
Possible suggestion
The conclusions section is now much more clearly written. As regards the final paragraph you
could consider reading Dowd (2014) where one of the concerns raised is that Bitcoin may
ultimately prove vulnerable to competitors. Another issue that may be worth considering is the
ultimate vulnerability of these currencies to national regulation – e.g. the new Swiss e-Franc, new
cryptocurrencies backed by large investment banks intended to supersede Ripple etc.

Overall comments
I would be happy to recommend publication of a suitably revised manuscript. I would also like to
acknowledge the efforts of the author team in revising the previous version. However, there are a
small number of minor changes I would like to see first. The main thing here is that I think a
couple of minor changes in writing style would be more in-keeping with a finance paper.
Required changes
Section 2.1
16
This now reads much more clearly. I think it would be worth just adding a sentence on the
financial interpretation of these parameters. For example, \epsilon_0 accounts for anything up to
a 5 standard deviation event and for a regular financial market that trades 5 days a week w
corresponds to intervals of between 2 weeks to 12 weeks.
Appendix E
I like the Appendix E. However, I think this would be better in the main manuscript e.g. Section
4.3 Additional robustness check. This would give your article more authority in terms of a finance
article. It also seems a shame to have this work hiding at the end of an Appendix.
References
Could you check references 10, 20 and 41 and possibly the remainder. One of the things to point
out here is that SSRN is an online repository rather than an electronic journal and these articles
may be more properly regarded as preprints. Do check though that these articles have not been
formally published in a journal.
Conclusions section
In order to bolster the finance contribution of the paper I think it would be worthwhile to clarify
in the first paragraph of the conclusions section:
• From an academic perspective the study of Bitcoin as the archetypal cryptocurrency is
important from an economic and a finance perspective.
• Approach also adds to econophysics analyses of the area that have been conducted before
Possible suggestion
The conclusions section is now much more clearly written. As regards the final paragraph you
could consider reading Dowd (2014) where one of the concerns raised is that Bitcoin may
ultimately prove vulnerable to competitors. Another issue that may be worth considering is the
ultimate vulnerability of these currencies to national regulation – e.g. the new Swiss e-Franc, new
cryptocurrencies backed by large investment banks intended to supersede Ripple etc.

Appendix B
Dear Reviewer and Editors,
irst of all, we thank you for taking the time to review our manuscript and the suggestions for improvement.
With this new submission, we believe that we successfully implemented all the proposed changes and hope to
meet the requirements to your satisfaction.
Below, we inserted our thoughts and comments into the body of the review letter:
This paper addresses a topic of growing interest, which is volatility of cryptoasset prices (specifically bitcoin in
his paper). While the paper is topical and has potential merit, it possesses too many problems in the form of
naccuracies, omissions, imprecision, and unsubstantiated conclusions to be suitable for publication in its
present state. I am very concerned about some of the conclusions in Section III, where the authors attempt to
ink certain events to changes in bitcoin’s price and fall victim to the very common problem (outside of
academia) of mistaking correlation is causation. “
Many previous works \citep{kindleberger,sornette2003,KaizoSor10,BrunnermeierOehmke2013,Xiong2013}
have shown that bubbles usually grow out of a rational reaction to a change of economic conditions, or to
novel opportunities, new technologies, and so on. Then, the price dynamics amplify beyond what seems
ustifiable through positive feedback processes. In this spirit, here our purpose is to document what could have
been the novel pieces of information that may have nucleated the bubbles. We are well aware that correlation
s not causation and our discussion here is more qualitative, with the goal of offering a partial account of the
atmosphere in which the bubbles studied quantitatively in the next section developed. This section is thus
more descriptive and sets up the backdrop against which to interpret the quantitative findings of section 4.
For example, the authors state that “The history of Bitcoin at its early stage was highly influenced by fiscal and
monetary measures undertaken during the Eurozone crisis” without providing robust empirical evidence to
upport this view.”
We changed the corresponding sentence to clarify that further below, in fact we do elaborate on the impacts of
he Eurozone Crisis and its components on the price of the cryptoasset. Further below, we give again a
definition of the Eurozone crisis, in order to show that we are backing the statement. Then, for instance on
p.10, as you also point out in the next sentence below, we directly state some of the measures undertaken
during the Cypriot Crisis, which in our understanding is part of the Eurozone Crisis.
However, we recognise that we do not “provide robust empirical evidence”. Again, this section is not the core
of the paper and is offered to present the context in which each of the diagnosed bubbles developed. The
description of the context cannot be rigorous but is nevertheless useful to provide the “scenery” of the bubble
actions.
The authors specifically reference the Cyprus deposit haircut crisis as explaining an increase in bitcoin’s price
p. 10 “Cypriot Crises that actually initiated the bubble”).“
We toned down the corresponding statement on p.11, in order to show that the Eurozone and Cypriot Crisis
may just have been some of the likely (but not the sole) drivers of the nucleation of this first bubble.
However, the authors again produce no empirical evidence that buyers of bitcoin were acting on the
Cyprus news, only that increased transaction activity and an increase in price coincided with events in Cyprus. “
We recognise that we do not “provide robust empirical evidence”. To our knowledge, it does not seem possible
o provide the type of rigorous evidence that the referee is requesting. However, repeating, our goal is to offer
a picture of the likely factors that may have been influencing the developments of the diagnosed bubbles.
In contrast, others have suggested that large buying unrelated to Cyprus in
March-April 2013 by a particular Silicon Valley-based investor is what drove the price increase
at this time. “
We thank you for this information and added the following in the text: “It is therefore interesting to observe
hat the nucleation of the first Bitcoin long bubble occurred at the exact time when the Greece and Cypriot
ndices reached their troughs. However, we should mention that there have also been rumours that the price
ncrease may have been driven in March-April 2013 by some particular Silicon Valley-based investor. It is even
possible that both factors are connected, the savvy investor recognising the implications of the Cyprus-Greek
risis and betting on it by bidding on bitcoin.”
We would like to emphasize again that the point of this subsection is not to demonstrate causality rigorously
but to paint the atmosphere of speculation that characterises this period.
There is also no mention of market manipulation, only changes in fundamental demand, throughout this
ection as a possible explanation of the price action.”
We now cite two papers suggesting that “Market manipulation, whose presence has been revealed more
ecently \citep{Gandal_manipul2018,Griffin_manipul2018}, may also have played an important role, for this
bubble as well as in the later bubble episodes.”
I find some of the descriptive terminology employed in the paper confusing. For example, a period of
elatively low volatility / flat prices (2015) is referred to as a “normal price growth” phase.“
Thank you for pointing out the misunderstanding that this term could have caused. We have removed this
erminology.
I also question the usefulness of using the term ‘bubble’ throughout the paper given the
debate over what constitutes a bubble.”
ou are right that defining what is a bubble is a controversial and still not fully settled problem with absence of
ommunity consensus. We actually review a part of the literature on this problem. But, in our manuscript, we
bypass this problem by making it very clear that we use a specific definition based on the existence of a
ransient super-exponential regime characterised by the LPPLS pattern. We make this even clearer in p. 4.
For many ‘bubbles’ or ‘manias’, such as tulips or blatant frauds, we see prices collapse and never rebound.”
t is correct that some bubbles never recover, but we respectfully disagree that this is for “many bubbles or
manias”. The historical evidence is clear that stock markets are upward drifting and most stock market bubbles
have been followed by a crash and then a recovery period. Anyway, this is a point secondary to our study and
do not want to develop it further.
To my knowledge no other instrument has shown the type of price action as bitcoin. Perhaps the term
correction’ would be more useful, appropriate, and less controversial.”
We use the term “drawdown”, which has a sound technical operational meaning. We also use the term crash
as it is customary to refer to large corrections as found here.
In terms of methods, the authors complain of “unpleasant arbitrariness” in the various
definitions of bubbles, but then proceed to provide what appears to be arbitrary hurdles for
what is a “large peak” and “intermediate peak”, respectively.”
At the end of section II-A, we write “Note that these sets of peak times are robust with respect to significant
$>\pm 20\%$) changes of the thresholds $0.95$ and $0.65$.” Thus, our approach is not arbitrary.
I would also be interested in learning how the particular method employed here for dating price regime
hanges compares with other methods for dating structural breaks, such as Bai and Perron, Banerjee et al,
Zeileis et al; no mention of these alternative methods is made in the paper.”
Thank you for this suggestion. Our algorithm for the detection of peak times is just a slight extension of the
Epsilon Drawdown Method} developed by \cite{JohSoroutlier98,SornetteJohansenoutlier01} and further used
n \citep{JohSorBrus10,FILIMONOV201527}. The algorithm is specifically designed to deal with price time series
as opposed to return time series), that is, to deal with their non-stationarity and to detect transient runs of
dependence. The performance of the algorithm has thus been documented. In contrast, the methods
mentioned by the referee has not well suited for this purpose, as they should apply to stationary time series.
There are a number of inaccuracies that suggest the authors have an incomplete understanding of bitcoin and
ts history. For example, in the opening paragraph the authors state “Given the turbulent market history that
Bitcoin has undergone since its inception in 2008”, when in fact bitcoins did not have a regularly quoted price
or ‘market history’ (meaning they did not trade actively on an exchange) until 2010.”
We apologise for the loose phrasing that led to the misinterpretation mentioned by the referee. We have now
emoved this confusion and rephrased.
Later, it is stated inaccurately that “Chinese exchanges such as Huobi and OKCoin moving their business
abroad”, when both firms are still quite active (e.g., hiring additional staff) inside China since the “ban”.”
We corrected the statement.
Some claims relating to China, in addition to being inaccurate, lack novelty.”
To repeat, the purpose of this section is to provide a self-contained synthesis of what we consider the main
atmosphere and environment prevailing at the time of the bubble regimes that we diagnose. Our intention is
not about novelty but about setting the stage to interpret better the quantitative analysis presented in the
ollowing section.
The source of the price data is not provided and needs to be provided, along with other
nformation (e.g., frequency).“
We inserted a sentence for this. The source of the data is Thomson Reuters Datastream Bitstamp quoted daily
data from August 2011.
Better referencing is also required (e.g., p. 3 which pundits have compared bitcoin to tulips and in what
ource?) There is also a disconcerting level of imprecision for a scientific paper (e.g., p. 2 “loss from the peak of
about two thirds” – the actual figure is 70%).”
We fixed the two inaccurate statements in p.2 and added a source on p.3 which explicitly compares bitcoin and
ulip bubble price series in a plot.
A suggestion: some additional data in the tables would also be useful (e.g., see below example
or other useful data). Also, some of the below data does not agree with the paper data, but I
annot validate as I do not know what price data source the author is using.”
We have added more information in Table 1, namely two columns giving additional absolute price information
on all qualified bubbles. Indeed, especially regarding the immense growth of Bitcoin’s price over the past years,
our suggestion to add some absolute price data for better orientation, was very helpful.
Appendix C
Review of Bitcoin’s multiscale bubble history from January 2012 to February 2018
Dear Reviewer and Editors,
hank you for taking the time to review our manuscript for the second time. The suggestions for improvement
are greatly appreciated. With this ultimate submission, we believe that we successfully implemented all the
proposed changes to our best possibilities and hope to meet the requirements to your satisfaction. Below, we
nserted our thoughts and comments into the body of the review letter:
Overall summary
This paper describes the use of the classical log-periodic power law model to analyse speculative bubbles in
Bitcoin markets – itself an emerging topic of independent research interest in finance and economics. Whilst I
have some concerns that more advanced methods are ultimately possible, e.g. based on extensions of the
model given in Appendix B, I think it would be important to see this group publish their perspective of such an
mportant topic in a good journal such as this.
Comments on previous revision
felt that some of the previous reviewer’s comments were a bit too harsh e.g. the application of speculative
bubble models to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency data is now well-established. As is the application of econophysics
models such as this. See for instance Cheah and Fry (2015), Fry and Cheah (2016) and Fry (2018). Note that
hese are papers published in mainstream economics and finance journals – here the publications in the
economics journal are particularly noteworthy. Whilst I am easy-going about whether the authors choose to
ite these in a revision the authors might find Fry and Cheah (2016) useful as a source of references both on
previous econophysics models applied to Bitcoin and the early economics and finance literature on Bitcoin.
Thank you for pointing out these articles which make a good addition to our list of references. The
orresponding references are cited in the paper, now.
A wholesale check of the article references should be performed e.g. the reference by Fantazzini [10] is already
published. Similarly, the article by Glazer et al. has been published in a journal.
We have rechecked and correctly referenced all sources to the best of our knowledge.
Required changes
ome more details of the Lagrange regularisation approach are needed. This seems to me to be a penalised
egression approach with a penalty applied to penalise against choosing a time window that is too short?
Not exactly. The difference in the approach is that the penalty is applied after obtaining the regression results
and not during the regression by penalizing the cost function. The Appendix Section D describing the technique
was complemented with some more details that should clarify the procedure.
Section 2.1.
More explanation is required as to the choice of \epsilon_0 and w. Why were these numbers chosen? More
explanation is also needed as regards how the short-bubble/long-bubble typology depends on the stated value
of f_t. It is not clear where this comes from. In principle, I like this distinction between short-bubbles and long-
bubbles but I think this needs to be placed on a firmer foundation.
The text may not have been completely clear about the procedure which is why we refer the reader to the
orresponding appendix explaining in detail the mathematical backgrounds of the epsilon method. The reason
hat we put this and other explanations like the lagrange regularisation or the lppls estimation to the appendix
s that we would like to keep the flow of the text. We however have adapted the text paragraph summarizing
he epsilon metric now, in order to make it more understandable also without reading the appendix. This
hould also clarify how the values of epsilon and w are robustly ‘averaged out’ from the procedure and that the
outcome of the complete procedure with respect to the choice of the threshold value f_t is actually quite
obust.
like the idea behind Section 3. This might need a bit better positioning in terms of
(a) Justified as a historical study of Bitcoin the archetypal cryptocurrency and of independent financial
and economic interest in its own right
(b) Similar analyses have already been undertaken before (see e.g. Fry and Cheah, 2016)
We have revisited the section and added a few more comments in different places. We would like to clarify
hat the overall intention of this section mainly is to justify the results of the bubble start and peak analysis that
was technically determined in Section 2 from an event point of view. We particularly searched for events that
may have fueled bubble formation and growth during the identified bubble periods. As mentioned in the
document, it is by no means the goal to cover the complete history of Bitcoin here, but to list a variety of likely
explanations for the intense bubble growth periodically observed on the cryptocurrency. This results in a long
ection of explanations, however the essential part of the paper then follows in the predictive analysis using
he LPPLS model.
There are necessarily some subjective elements here as identified by the previous reviewer but I don’t think
hat this is necessarily a problem. Need to provide a reference for the comment about a Silicon Valley based
nvestor.
Done.
think the orientation of Section 4 is wrong and this section should be replaced with something more in
eeping with the overall aims of the paper. If this paper is for the most part a historical analysis of Bitcoin then I
hink this issue of real-time analysis is slightly tangential and out of place.
t is important to us to mention that it is, as stated, not the sole goal of the paper to give a complete historical
overview over the evolution of Bitcoin. Rather, we use section three, in order to justify our technically
determined bubble results, in order to show that indeed the results based on LPPLS analysis agree with real
world events. We consider the real time analysis an essential and valuable core piece of the paper, as we can
how here that indeed with the LPPLS model we are able to predict regime changes in Bitcoin.
What I think would be more useful in its place is to include an additional robustness check of the long and short
bubbles identified in Section 3 using a more standard econometric methodology. Possibly something as simple
as a standard event study. I was a little concerned about how the referee comment about using alternative
methods was seemingly casually dismissed in the original rebuttal. The method of Bai and Perron is
mplemented in an R package, Strucchange I think, and might be used to test for a change in the mean or the
ariance of the log-returns. However, I suspect a better approach here would be to use a simple event study
methodology applied to the start-date of each of the identified short and long bubbles.
We have added an additional section in the appendix, where we perform a change point detection on the
eturns of Bitcoin during the analyzed time period, similar to the original suggestion by the reviewer to employ
he method of Bai and Perron. We find that the main regimes identified with the change point analysis agree
with our results. We did not include an event study, as we consider it a difficult practice to try to assign bitcoin
eturns to specific events. This is why we on the one hand throughout the paper emphasize again and again
hat the listed nucleating factors are just some of the possible influences that led to bubble formation, and on
he other hand, we emphasize that the bubble start times that we find are the dates that initiate a period
during which multiple events that promote bubble growth may occur.
The conclusions section should be shortened and better focussed to the contribution of the paper – namely a
etrospective analysis and typology of historical bitcoin bubbles by somebody whose work I’ve always admired.
We have shortened the conclusion section.
Do check the references as I think there are probably multiple mistakes here. (I realise this may be harder to
get right than in other papers due to the abundance of electronic-only references and the fast-paced nature of
he subject).
As stated above, we have rechecked all references. In order to avoid confusion about the online sources, we
have created a dryad repository for storage of all relevant online articles in pdf format. The repository can be
openly accessed by anyone trying to track the sources.
incerely,

Appendix D
Response to final review, May 2019
Dear Reviewer and Editors,
Thank you for the final review of our paper. We are glad to hear that the manuscript was accepted
or publication at RSOS. In this final iteration of our paper, we have introduced minor additional
changes, as requested by the reviewer and editors. Please see our direct reply to the review letter
below inline.
Review of Bitcoin’s multiscale bubble history form January 2012 to February 2018
Overall comments
would be happy to recommend publication of a suitably revised manuscript. I would also like to
acknowledge the efforts of the author team in revising the previous version. However, there are a
mall number of minor changes I would like to see first. The main thing here is that I think a couple of
minor changes in writing style would be more in-keeping with a finance paper.
Thank you.
Required changes
Section 2.1
This now reads much more clearly. I think it would be worth just adding a sentence on the financial
nterpretation of these parameters. For example, \epsilon_0 accounts for anything up to a 5 standard
deviation event and for a regular financial market that trades 5 days a week w corresponds to
ntervals of between 2 weeks to 12 weeks.
We added some explanation to the paragraph in the text body. We point out, that for detailed
pecifications of the described techniques, the reader should always refer to the Appendices
eferenced in the text, where everything is described in full detail.
Appendix E
like the Appendix E. However, I think this would be better in the main manuscript e.g. Section 4.3
Additional robustness check. This would give your article more authority in terms of a finance article.
t also seems a shame to have this work hiding at the end of an Appendix.
Thank you for pointing out the value of this part which in fact is better placed in the text body. We
nserted the appendix E (with a little adaptation) as the new subsection 2.4 and deleted the
corresponding Appendix. We think that the content is best suited directly following the determined
bubbles, because it relates to and confirms the presented results.
References
Could you check references 10, 20 and 41 and possibly the remainder. One of the things to point out
here is that SSRN is an online repository rather than an electronic journal and these articles may be
more properly regarded as preprints. Do check though that these articles have not been formally
published in a journal.
We have checked all references again. To the best of our knowledge, all references are up to date
and we did not find any newer versions or citations.
Conclusions section
n order to bolster the finance contribution of the paper I think it would be worthwhile to clarify in
he first paragraph of the conclusions section:
• From an academic perspective the study of Bitcoin as the archetypal cryptocurrency is
mportant from an economic and a finance perspective.
• Approach also adds to econophysics analyses of the area that have been conducted before
The conclusion section now comprises a new first paragraph stating the reasons why we believe it is
worthwhile to study Bitcoin as a representative example. This addresses your first point.
Furthermore, another paragraph has been added further below, emphasizing the relevance of the
quantitative LPPL methods applied in this paper, thereby addressing your second point.
Possible suggestion
The conclusions section is now much more clearly written. As regards the final paragraph you could
consider reading Dowd (2014) where one of the concerns raised is that Bitcoin may ultimately prove
vulnerable to competitors. Another issue that may be worth considering is the ultimate vulnerability
of these currencies to national regulation – e.g. the new Swiss e-Franc, new cryptocurrencies backed
by large investment banks intended to supersede Ripple etc.
Dowd, K. (2014). New private monies – a bit-part player? Institute for Economic Affairs, London.
Thank you for the additional source. We retrieved the book and read it in details. We decided not to
add it as a reference because, while interesting and important, it is not relevant to our paper: please
note again, that although the social bubble drivers section is a contribution to our paper, our main
ocus is on the quantitative techniques that we use to identify bubbles ex-ante and ex-post and to
predict crashes. Additionally discussing the legal and regulation aspects behind Bitcoin in the
conclusions section would open up another topic, deviating the attention away from the main points
of our study.
Concerning the point about vulnerability to competitors, we already pointed out in the social drivers
ection that the market capitalization share of Bitcoin has dramatically decreased in 2017/18,
because of new money flowing into competing ICO-released CCs. We believe that this point has
herefore been addressed.
With kind regards,
