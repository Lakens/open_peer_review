In this work, the authors studied the oligomer heterogeneity of Aß42 and the kinetics of
oligomer and fibril formation. This work is important since Aß is a well-known amyloid protein
but its oligomerization and fibrillization are still not fully understood. Here, the authors used a
combination of practical techniques, including ultrafiltration, TEM, and fluorescence methods,
and observed a wide range of oligomer sizes with distinct fibril formation kinetics. The study was
well executed and the data support the conclusions.
Minor comments:
1). Why do the smaller oligomers form fibrils faster than the larger ones? Perhaps provide some
rationale or speculation in the discussion.
2). Page 7, line 4, could the authors provide a reference for “a separate study of the Guo
laboratory”?
3). Figure 1, would the size distribution of the oligomers be different with longer incubation times
than 10-20 minutes after the buffer exchange?
4). Figure 2, what were the concentrations of the original unfiltered samples?

The relationship between oligomers and amyloid fibrils in the aggregation process has been
clarified in these papers (PMID: 27500912; 27226198; 28671122; 29338255; 30480261). The authors
should add this information in the introduction.

Moreover, using electron microscopy and others methods it has been shown for Abeta peptides
and their fragments and also for insulin and the peptide fragments from the BGL2P protein that
amyloid fibrils consist of oligomers (PMID: 27500912; 27226198; 28671122; 29338255; 30480261;
30686252).
The peak of sizes on Fig. 1b (8 nm) corresponds to the size of oligomers that contribute to the
formation of the amyloid fibrils for Abeta40 and Abeta42 (see these papers PMID: 28671122;
27016282). According to the results of this manuscript the amyloid fibrils also are constructed
from the oligomers.
It should be underline that folding nucleus for globular proteins and for formation of fibrils are
different (PMID: 24404849), because as has been demonstrated the primary folding nucleus for
Abeta40 consists of 2 monomers and for Abeta42 - 3 monomers (see the papers PMID: 27016282;
28671122), but folding nucleus for Abeta peptide is different (for comparison please see this paper
PMID: 15632297).
The authors should accent some points in the paper taking into account this new information.

Aggregation of Abeta peptide has been considered to be closely related with the pathology of
Alzheimer’s disease, however the stochastic characteristic of oligomer and fibril formation of
Abeta makes it particularly challenging for reliable investigation of the fundamental mechanistic
roles of the peptide in AD pathology. Xue et al. in this manuscript reported an elegant study of
the potential correlation of oligomer heterogeneity and fibril polymorphism of Abeta. They
performed ultrafiltration with variant cutoff size to separate Abeta oligomers with different size.
The aggregation kinetics of these oligomers were monitored and compared, showing that smaller
oligomers surprisingly forms fibrils with a faster rate. The difference of EGCG solubilization of
fibrils from oligomers with distinct size further indicate the structural variances of the fibrils. The
experiments were carried out thoroughly to confirm the aggregation difference observed, and the
data was carefully analyzed and well discussed. The results provide new mechanistic insight into
4
the polymorphism nature of the amyloid structures. The manuscript is suitable for publication,
after considering some minor points addressed below:
1. “ADDL” was mentioned in the second paragraph of page 4. The full meaning of this
abbreviation need to be provided.
2. The authors reported a surprising fast oligomer formation rate of Abeta42 sample. Indeed, the
fast formation of oligomers of Abeta42/42 has been realized in literatures (e.g., fast oligomer
formation within hours for Abet40, a moderate aggregation prone one compared to Abeta42,
Elbassal et al., JPCC, 2017, 20007). The authors may include more relevant literature reports in the

ponse to reviewer’s comments
We thank the reviewers for their review and comments. The new references suggested
some details pointed out by the reviewers help greatly to improve this manuscript. We have
sed our manuscript accordingly. Detailed below are our point-by-point responses.

his work, the authors studied the oligomer heterogeneity of Aß42 and the kinetics of oligomer
fibril formation. This work is important since Aß is a well-known amyloid protein but its
omerization and fibrillization are still not fully understood. Here, the authors used a
bination of practical techniques, including ultrafiltration, TEM, and fluorescence methods,
observed a wide range of oligomer sizes with distinct fibril formation kinetics. The study was
l executed and the data support the conclusions.
or comments:
Why do the smaller oligomers form fibrils faster than the larger ones? Perhaps provide some
onale or speculation in the discussion.
Response: We have added more discussion on why the smaller oligomers form fibrils
er than the larger ones. The relevant text is copied below for reviewer’s convenience
page 6, paragraph 2:
“Two main factors contribute to the apparent fibril growth rate: the rate of fibril
elongation and the concentration of fibril nuclei. Because the same Aß42 protein was
used, the rate of fibril elongation is likely similar for different filtrates. Therefore, we
speculate that the high fibril growth rate for the 100 kD sample is mainly due to higher
concentrations of fibril nuclei than the 1000 kD and 0.2 µm filtrates.”
page 7, paragraph 3:
“Therefore, our model suggests that Aß42 samples of smaller oligomers would form a
higher concentration of fibril nuclei, consistent with the higher apparent fibril growth
rate (Figures 3 and 4). The shorter lag time for the fibrillization of smaller oligomers is
likely due to a faster conversion rate from oligomers to fibril nuclei.”
Page 7, line 4, could the authors provide a reference for “a separate study of the Guo
oratory”?
Response: The mentioned study is still ongoing and the data are not yet published. In the
sed text, we added “unpublished data” to clarify this.
Figure 1, would the size distribution of the oligomers be different with longer incubation
s than 10-20 minutes after the buffer exchange?
Response: We did not investigate the potential changes in oligomer size distribution
n further incubation at 4°C. The main objective of this work is to capture the size distribution
e first moment of Aß aggregation. Therefore, every effort is given to minimize the delay
m solubilization of Aß in an aqueous buffer to subsequent experiments, including
afiltration, concentration determination, and aggregation. The aggregation experiments
gest that the oligomers formed at the beginning of the aggregation do not re-equilibrate after
ation. Otherwise, we would not have observed the different fibrillization kinetics from
erent filtrates. The lag time of fibrillization at 37°C is on the order of hours, suggesting that
oligomers are stable for at least hours, if not longer. We believe that this is an important point
may deserve to be further investigated in the future, but it does not have any impact on the
clusions of this study.
Figure 2, what were the concentrations of the original unfiltered samples?
Response: The concentrations of Aß in CG buffer were all at 50 µM. After buffer
hange, all samples were used for filtration experiments, and the concentration of the
ltered sample was not measured. The point of Figure 2 is to show that the concentrations of
larger and smaller oligomers vary greatly from sample to sample, and from batch to batch.
this conclusion is not affected by the information on the concentration of the unfiltered
ple. We agree that this might be a useful data point, if available, to see if the size distribution
ligomers is related to the concentration of the starting unfiltered sample and will be
sidered in future studies. And we thank the reviewer for pointing this out.

this paper PMID: 15632297).
authors should accent some points in the paper taking into account this new information.
Response: We thank the reviewer for brining this new information to our attention. We
e revised our manuscript taking into account these references suggested by the reviewer.
In the first paragraph of Introduction (page 3), we added the references to ring-like
omers as building blocks of amyloid fibrils (refs 11-15).
“Some studies suggest that oligomers eventually are converted to amyloid fibrils [9,10]
or form the building blocks of amyloid fibrils [11–15], and other studies show that the
amyloid fibrils can also promote the formation of oligomers [16].”
In the second paragraph of Introduction (page 3), we added references 32 and 33 and a
sentence to refer readers to these studies.
“There are also studies suggesting that Aß forms ring-like oligomers, which form the
building blocks of amyloid fibrils [15,32,33].”
In Results and Discussion, we added new references for the oligomer formation of Aß40
Aß42 (page 4, paragraph 2). References 13 and 34 are added to this part of discussion.
“Previously, fast oligomerization has also been observed for both Aß40 and Aß42
[9,13,34,35,38,39], suggesting that oligomerization may be the first step of Aß
aggregation.”
We removed a sentence that directly compares protein folding with fibril nucleation to
id confusion. The removed sentence is “We envision that the initial oligomerization process
milar to the formation of transition state in the protein folding” on page 8, first paragraph.
a result, the related discussion on comparison of protein folding nucleus and fibril nucleus
also removed.

“ADDL” was mentioned in the second paragraph of page 4. The full meaning of this

Response: ADDL is the abbreviation of Aß-derived diffusible ligand, and we have now
ed this to both the main text and the abbreviations list.
The authors reported a surprising fast oligomer formation rate of Abeta42 sample.
eed, the fast formation of oligomers of Abeta42/42 has been realized in literatures (e.g., fast

Response: We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. We have added more
