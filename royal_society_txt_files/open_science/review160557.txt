Line 247. Phyllantus tenellus – couldn’t be found. Phyllanthus tenellus Roxb. could be found as
a Australian tropical rainforest plant introduced from Mauritius, but it’s in the family
Phyllanthaceae not Euphorbiaceae. This plant genus and species need to be confirmed as well as
the correct family. There are very few Euphorbs that are infected with phytoplasma.
It would be interesting to know if D. citri can also transmit the phytoplasma transovarially as it
can the Liberibacter.

Manuscript ID RSOS-160557, entitled "Invasive mutualisms between a plant pathogen and insect
vectors in the Middle East and Brazil."
This article investigates the potential vector capability of two phloem-feeder insects Diaphornia
citri and Hishimonus phycitis, in two distinct geographic regions: Brazil and Oman. The authors
investigated the transmission capability, the potential reservoir of non-citrus hosts, and the effect
of infection on the vector life history traits. It is a big piece of work that could become a good and
informative article. However, there is great need of clarification especially for the transmission
assay that is very confusing and difficult to understand.
MAJOR COMMENTS
L116-136: I found this section extremely confusing, more details and more explanations are
needed.
3
L125: I don’t understand how a positive result in PCR could be a false positive? Maybe that
would be easier to understand if the term ‘snapshot’ was defined properly. Also the term “type-I
error” is used in statistics, not for false positives obtained during a laboratory procedure.
L126-128 This part is a mystery for me: what is the interest of rearing already infected vectors on
an infected plant? What do we learn from that? That doesn’t make any sense to me. We cannot
investigated pathogen acquisition by the vectors (vectors were already infected), we don’t learn
anything about the transmission to the plant (the plant is already infected), we don’t learn
anything about the retention of phytoplasma by the vector, given that the plant is infected and
that the vectors are in contact with the pathogen and can be reinfected by feeding… What is the
interest of this experiment and how can conclude that the pathogen is “is likely persistently
propagated and carried by both insect vector candidates “? If the plant is already infected you
don’t learn anything about propagation. In my opinion this experiment is unnecessary doesn’t
bring anything new, and consequently should be removed.
L132-135: I don’t understand this sentence, please reword.
L 135: “Despite this, we have demonstrated that the pathogen cycles between insect vector and
plant host over a period of at least 8 weeks.” How did you demonstrated that?? It is not clear at
all for me. Same thing for the statement line 137-138.
L137-150: At any point during this crucial experiment the authors mention the control plants that
were keep separated from insects (L 480). The authors must precise in the result section if these
plants that were uninfected and isolated from the insects were still uninfected at the end of the
experiment. Without proper controls it is impossible for me to approve this experiment.
L141-145: First of all, it is clear that 5 infected plants out of 9 is not significantly different from 3
out of 9. So making any assumption (L. 145-150) about who is the best vector seems a huge
overstatement. In addition the transmission likelihood rate are only estimated from one data
point (one density, one exposure time). The experiment should be repeated with different vector
densities, with different exposition time to really appreciate the probability of phytoplasma
transmission by the vectors (See Pelz-Stelinski et al. 2010). The only thing that this experiment
demonstrated (pending that the controls were still uninfected after the experiment) is that H.
phycitis and D. citri are effective vector of C. auantifolia. All the other conclusions of this
paragraph are overstatements that should be removed.
L230-232: The difficulty with this hypothesis is that the authors don’t know if the insect vectors
were infected or not. They did not compared phytoplasma-infected vectors vs uninfected vectors,
but a population with a mix of infected and uninfected vectors feeding on infected or uninfected
plants. Therefore, even if the phytoplasama interacts with the vector reproduction system, this
experiment will not be able to demonstrate that.
L236-238: This sentence is a huge overstatement, on a total different system. It should be
removed.
L293: In this part data are only presented on supplementary files. Supplementary files should be
used to present preliminary data, or figures that are not essential for the understanding of the
experiment results.
L430: This 9 healthy plants have been maintained for the transmission experiment I guess, so this
sentence should be moved to the next paragraph. Also we don’t know what happened to them,
were they still uninfected after the experiment?
4
L451: I understand technical limitations, but the authors should acknowledge somewhere that
having a temperature range between 25.7 and 32 °C is not optimal for a life table study. Even if
the authors paid attention to associate infected and uninfected plant in the experiment, this has
probably lead to a lot of variability that may explain negative results obtained in the development
time.
L456-461: As the author did not test the insects after the life table, they cannot correlate properly
infection and performance of the vectors. This point should be discussed, and should undermine
any conclusion regarding any potential manipulation of the vector by the phytoplasma.
MINOR COMMENTS
L26-27 This first sentence is unnecessary complicated and does not inform at all about the subject
of the article.
Abstract: Latin names should be italicized.
L. 60 please include the scientific name of the phytoplasma
L.83 change to: “One of the most damaging disease…”
L100-102: I think that the authors should open the discussion to North America. In the USA and
particularly in Florida, D. citri is well implanted and is the major treat to the citrus industry. If
this phytoplasma has to be also transmitted by D citri, in addition to Candidatus liberibacter
asiaticus, that would be a disaster for Florida.
L107-113: Please present your article in the same order than your plan
L119: What is ‘snapshot’?
L132, Change to: This occurred likely because…
L185: Please precise what is the difference between the uninfected and the control treatments
L189: References 31 and 32 do not include comparison of life tables of insects on pathogen-
infected vs uninfected hosts. They should be removed.
L190-193: I would move this paragraph before the start of the paragraph L 176. By doing so, the
readers understand why the intrinsic rate of increase was higher on phytoplasma-infected plants
compared to control plants.
L201-202: I do not understand this sentence, please reword.
L207-211: The authors should develop in more detail this point and open the discussion on the
situation occurring in Florida and California with D. citri and HLB.
L247: Please include reference: it is a personal observation? If yes who did it?
L256: I disagree with the use of ‘polyphagous’ for D. citri. D. citri can, indeed, feed on several
non-Rutaceae plants but its survival would be highly impacted (Martini et al. 2013). More
importantly, D. citri only breed on Rutaceae (with only one known exception the old world fig
tree, Thomas et al. 2011).
L378: Include the company for the D-Vac.
L399: Please also include in Table S3 the sequences of the probes used.
5
L506: References are not in the good format. There should have no period after the authors
initials (Power AG not Power A.G.). Oppositely, period are required after each abbreviation in
the journal title (Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. not Crit Rev Plant Sci).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
Overall the article is much clearer than the first draft. It is very good addition to the Asia citrus
psyllid and phytoplasma bibliography. I enjoyed reviewing this article. I recommend this article
pending that the authors address the comments below.
MAJOR COMMENTS:
L116-128 I apologize if I am wrong, but I don’t remember this experiment in the first version of
the article. The issue with this method is that microbe titer such as phytoplasma may increase
during the development of the insect (see Hoffmann et al. 2015). That may be interesting to
discuss this issue in the discussion. Also the method for DNA extraction of eggs is not mentioned
11
in the Material and Methods (L. 386). Considering the size of D. citri eggs I doubt that a single
eggs was analyzed, how many eggs were pulled together for each samples?
MINOR COMMENTS:
L31 A period is missing
L31 change to “we first studied the vector capacity …”
L35: change to “Feeding on phytoplasma infected hosts greatly increased…”
L243-244 : feeding or just settling? I think the authors should discuss the other paper dealing with
presence and absence of D. citri on non citrus host (Martini 2013, 2016, Thomas 2011, Pena, 2006)

Comments to the Author(s)
Overall the article is much clearer than the first draft. It is very good addition to the Asia citrus
psyllid and phytoplasma bibliography. I enjoyed reviewing this article. I recommend this article
pending that the authors address the comments below.
MAJOR COMMENTS:
L116-128 I apologize if I am wrong, but I don’t remember this experiment in the first version of
the article. The issue with this method is that microbe titer such as phytoplasma may increase
during the development of the insect (see Hoffmann et al. 2015). That may be interesting to
14
discuss this issue in the discussion. Also the method for DNA extraction of eggs is not mentioned
in the Material and Methods (L. 386). Considering the size of D. citri eggs I doubt that a single
eggs was analyzed, how many eggs were pulled together for each samples?
MINOR COMMENTS:
L31 A period is missing
L31 change to “we first studied the vector capacity …”
L35: change to “Feeding on phytoplasma infected hosts greatly increased…”
L243-244 : feeding or just settling? I think the authors should discuss the other paper dealing with
presence and absence of D. citri on non citrus host (Martini 2013, 2016, Thomas 2011, Pena, 2006)

Appendix A
Dear Dr Power,
Thank you for your consideration of our paper “Invasive mutualisms between a plant
pathogen and insect vectors in the Middle East and Brazil” (RSOS-160557) and the
opportunity to resubmit a revised version.
We have modified the manuscript according to the suggestions of the referees. We
feel that we have been able to deal with all of the comments and have only differed on
one point, which is a reference we prefer to keep (see below). We have responded to
all of the points, preceding our response with three asterisks.
We would like to thank the reviewers for suggesting these changes, which we feel
have vastly improved the manuscript, and we look forward to hearing back from you.
Naturally we would be more than willing to consider any further changes, should
these be necessary.
Yours sincerely,
Philip Donkersley, Renan Queiroz and Simon Elliot.

Comments to the Author(s)
Line 247. Phyllantus tenellus – couldn’t be found. Phyllanthus tenellus Roxb. could
be found as a Australian tropical rainforest plant introduced from Mauritius, but it’s in
the family Phyllanthaceae not Euphorbiaceae. This plant genus and species need to
be confirmed as well as the correct family. There are very few Euphorbs that are
infected with phytoplasma.
*** The referee is quite correct and we thank him or her for pointing this out. Yes the
family is Phyllanthaceae (not Euphorbiaceae). Furthermore, the full species name for
the plant in question is Phyllanthus tenellus var. arabicus, which according to the
Encyclopedia of Life Herbarium Notes should more correctly be Phyllanthus
maderaspatensis L. This plant was introduced from Australia and is recorded in the
Arabian Peninsula. Both of these corrections have been made in the text (L242, L245,
L251 and Figure 3).
It would be interesting to know if D. citri can also transmit the phytoplasma
transovarially as it can the Liberibacter.
*** We agree and we have these data but had not originally included them in the
manuscript. We have taken the liberty of understanding the referee’s comment as an
invitation to include these data and have done so. New text is to be found in the
Results and Discussion (L114-126) and Materials and Methods (L420-425) with
relevant references added. Briefly, we found no evidence for transovarial transmission
in D. citri.

Comments to the Author(s)
Manuscript ID RSOS-160557, entitled "Invasive mutualisms between a plant
pathogen and insect vectors in the Middle East and Brazil."
This article investigates the potential vector capability of two phloem-feeder insects
Diaphornia citri and Hishimonus phycitis, in two distinct geographic regions: Brazil
and Oman. The authors investigated the transmission capability, the potential
reservoir of non-citrus hosts, and the effect of infection on the vector life history
traits. It is a big piece of work that could become a good and informative article.
However, there is great need of clarification especially for the transmission assay that
is very confusing and difficult to understand.
*** We thank the referee for his/her positive evaluation and are extremely grateful for
the considerable effort invested in suggesting changes.
MAJOR COMMENTS
L116-136: I found this section extremely confusing, more details and more
explanations are needed.
*** We have now removed this paragraph, in line with a further comment from this
referee below. We have adjusted the Materials and Methods accordingly (L426-435).
Please see responses to individual comments below.
L125: I don’t understand how a positive result in PCR could be a false positive?
Maybe that would be easier to understand if the term ‘snapshot’ was defined properly.
Also the term “type-I error” is used in statistics, not for false positives obtained during
a laboratory procedure.
*** Removed – see previous comment.
L126-128 This part is a mystery for me: what is the interest of rearing already
infected vectors on an infected plant? What do we learn from that? That doesn’t make
any sense to me. We cannot investigated pathogen acquisition by the vectors (vectors
were already infected), we don’t learn anything about the transmission to the plant
(the plant is already infected), we don’t learn anything about the retention of
phytoplasma by the vector, given that the plant is infected and that the vectors are in
contact with the pathogen and can be reinfected by feeding… What is the interest of
this experiment and how can conclude that the pathogen is “is likely persistently
propagated and carried by both insect vector candidates “? If the plant is already
infected you don’t learn anything about propagation. In my opinion this experiment is
unnecessary doesn’t bring anything new, and consequently should be removed.
*** We agree that this part was far from clear. We have removed this paragraph from
the MS.
L132-135: I don’t understand this sentence, please reword.
*** This sentence has been removed – see previous comments.
L137-150: At any point during this crucial experiment the authors mention the control
plants that were keep separated from insects (L 480). The authors must precise in the
result section if these plants that were uninfected and isolated from the insects were
still uninfected at the end of the experiment. Without proper controls it is impossible
for me to approve this experiment.
*** We have rewritten the relevant parts of the Results & Discussion (L131-134) and
the Materials & Methods (L420-435).
L141-145: First of all, it is clear that 5 infected plants out of 9 is not significantly
different from 3 out of 9. So making any assumption (L. 145-150) about who is the
best vector seems a huge overstatement. In addition the transmission likelihood rate
are only estimated from one data point (one density, one exposure time). The
experiment should be repeated with different vector densities, with different
exposition time to really appreciate the probability of phytoplasma transmission by
the vectors (See Pelz-Stelinski et al. 2010). The only thing that this experiment
demonstrated (pending that the controls were still uninfected after the experiment) is
that H. phycitis and D. citri are effective vector of C. auantifolia. All the other
conclusions of this paragraph are overstatements that should be removed.
*** We have removed this section, including Table 1. We did leave in the fact that
there were many more D. citri used in the experiment than H. phycitis,- given the
numbers of plants infected were similar in spite of this, it may be that D. citri is an
inferior vector (L129-134). If the editor or referee feels that even this is too much, we
can remove it.
L230-232: The difficulty with this hypothesis is that the authors don’t know if the
insect vectors were infected or not. They did not compared phytoplasma-infected
vectors vs uninfected vectors, but a population with a mix of infected and uninfected
vectors feeding on infected or uninfected plants. Therefore, even if the phytoplasama
interacts with the vector reproduction system, this experiment will not be able to
demonstrate that.
*** We agree and have added this proviso in parentheses (L227-229)
L236-238: This sentence is a huge overstatement, on a total different system. It should
be removed.
*** Agreed, removed.
L293: In this part data are only presented on supplementary files. Supplementary files
should be used to present preliminary data, or figures that are not essential for the
understanding of the experiment results.
*** Agreed. Supplementary figure 3 has been amended to Figure 3 throughout the
text.
L430: This 9 healthy plants have been maintained for the transmission experiment I
guess, so this sentence should be moved to the next paragraph. Also we don’t know
what happened to them, were they still uninfected after the experiment?
*** Yes, but this text has been removed (see response to first set of MAJOR
COMMENTS above).
L451: I understand technical limitations, but the authors should acknowledge
somewhere that having a temperature range between 25.7 and 32 °C is not optimal for
a life table study. Even if the authors paid attention to associate infected and
uninfected plant in the experiment, this has probably lead to a lot of variability that
may explain negative results obtained in the development time.
*** Agreed. We feel this is important so have addressed it in the Results &
Discussion (L165-167).
L456-461: As the author did not test the insects after the life table, they cannot
correlate properly infection and performance of the vectors. This point should be
discussed, and should undermine any conclusion regarding any potential manipulation
of the vector by the phytoplasma.
*** We agree, and have amended the text accordingly (L214-219).
MINOR COMMENTS
L26-27 This first sentence is unnecessary complicated and does not inform at all
about the subject of the article.
*** Agreed, amended to: Complex multi-trophic interactions in vectorborne diseases
limit our understanding and ability to predict outbreaks. (L22-23)
Abstract: Latin names should be italicized.
*** Done.
L. 60 please include the scientific name of the phytoplasma
*** Included (L57-58)
L.83 change to: “One of the most damaging disease…”
*** Ammended. (L79-80)
L100-102: I think that the authors should open the discussion to North America. In
the USA and particularly in Florida, D. citri is well implanted and is the major treat to
the citrus industry. If this phytoplasma has to be also transmitted by D citri, in
addition to Candidatus liberibacter asiaticus, that would be a disaster for Florida.
*** While we agree that this is worth inclusion, we feel that this is better placed in the
Results & Discussion section (L202-206).
L107-113: Please present your article in the same order than your plan
*** In this paragraph (now L99-L109) we provide a summary of the experimental
approach and structure of the paper. The article is presented as 4 experiments, [1]
vectors of the phytoplasma, [2] the performance of D. citri on phytoplasma-infected
lime, [3] local weed species as reservoirs for ‘Ca. Phytoplasma aurantifolia’, [4] the
inoculum pressure in Oman. This is then the structure we follow in the (subsequent)
Results and Discussion section. We have not changed this as we feel it already
explains the order of the rest of the paper, unless there is something we are missing.
L119: What is ‘snapshot’?
*** This sentence has been removed (see our response to this reviewer’s first
‘MAJOR COMMENT’, above).
L132, Change to: This occurred likely because…
*** This sentence has been removed (see our response to this reviewer’s first
‘MAJOR COMMENT’, above).
L185: Please precise what is the difference between the uninfected and the control
treatments
*** Unfortunately, we did not explain this adequately in the original version of the
MS. Apologies for this. We actually conducted the experiment in Oman after the
Brazil one, and we added another treatment, a second control designed to see if
herbivore-induction of defences prior to the experiment might account for the
differences. There were no differences between the two controls. We have edited the
the text to include this (L151-154; L181-183; L456-462).
L189: References 31 and 32 do not include comparison of life tables of insects on
pathogen-infected vs uninfected hosts. They should be removed.
*** Whereas reference 32 does not include a comparable life table and has therefore
been removed, we feel the effects of temperature on D citri life history traits in
reference 31 allows us to make an appropriate comparison to our results here and
therefore we have not removed it. (L199)
L190-193: I would move this paragraph before the start of the paragraph L 176. By
doing so, the readers understand why the intrinsic rate of increase was higher on
phytoplasma-infected plants compared to control plants.
*** Agreed and amended. (L184-187)
L201-202: I do not understand this sentence, please reword.
*** We have reworded this (L193-196).
L207-211: The authors should develop in more detail this point and open the
discussion on the situation occurring in Florida and California with D. citri and HLB.
*** We have done so. (L202-206).
L247: Please include reference: it is a personal observation? If yes who did it?
*** Yes, this was a personal observation by the first author and we have included this
(L242).
L256: I disagree with the use of ‘polyphagous’ for D. citri. D. citri can, indeed, feed
on several non-Rutaceae plants but its survival would be highly impacted (Martini et
al. 2013). More importantly, D. citri only breed on Rutaceae (with only one known
exception the old world fig tree, Thomas et al. 2011).
*** We have revised this to state that it has a wide host range within the citrus genus
(L255-257).
L378: Include the company for the D-Vac.
*** Done (L375-376)
L399: Please also include in Table S3 the sequences of the probes used.
*** Table S3 contains the sequences for all the primers used in this study.
L506: References are not in the good format. There should have no period after the
authors initials (Power AG not Power A.G.). Oppositely, period are required after
each abbreviation in the journal title (Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. not Crit Rev Plant Sci).
*** Agreed and amended throughout.
Thank you for your consideration of our paper “Invasive mutualisms between a plant
pathogen and insect vectors in the Middle East and Brazil” (RSOS-160557) and the
