This manuscript investigated the pyrophoric activated metal Mg surface combustion
characteristics through the comparison between the numerical analysis and experimental results.
Authors firstly established the surface heat balance equation and the adiabatic wall temperature
distribution of chaff. Then the combustion characteristics were obtained and compared with IR
thermographic results, including maximal and minimal surface temperature, the variation of
radiation intensity and the required time to reach the maximal radiation intensity. The results are
interesting and can give useful information in the field of pyrophoric metal combustion.
However, some points are required to be clarified before it can be accepted for publication. The
specific comments are given below:
1. In the abstract, the author claimed “To solve the combustion problem of chaff,…”. But it is not
pointed out what is the detailed problem need to be solved in the abstract.
2. In the introduction part, only simply list the reference is not convincing. More details derived
from references related with this research are needed.
3. In the eq.(2.4), the z=L(t) is the explained as the surface of activated metal. It is confusing. Does
z stand for the height of surface position?
4. In P6 L17-20, it is suggested to state the values for mean free path length of diffusing molecules
(O2, etc.) and compare with the hole diameter.
5. In P6, please correct the unit of Boltzmann constant.
6. In the figure 3, the axis title for x and y should be labelled. It is also suggested to use the same
y-axis range for (a)-(d) figures to compare the results.
7. In the figure 5, the temperature distribution from IR thermograph is not clearly presented.
Please explain more details and try to enhance the figure resolution.
8. In part 4.1, more discussion is needed in this part to interpret the increase of reaction rate with
velocity.
9. In the part 4.3.4, please offer the detailed values for the errors. The maximal and minimal
temperature of surface seems not to be negligible between experimental and numerical results.
10. The typos should be diminished and grammar is needed to be improved. For example:
(1) P9L38, “…, what can be known from CFD”;
(2) P13L35, “…. This because the effect of…”;
(3) P14L25, 3-5um; etc.

General Comments:
In the work of Hesong Huang et al., pyrophoric activated metal Mg was used to study activated
metal chaff surface combustion characteristics. Surface combustion characteristics of pyrophoric
activated metal chaff are obtained by numerical computation. The chaff adiabatic wall
temperature distribution was computed by CFD under the impact of high speed airflow. Then,
chaff surface temperature distribution was obtained by solving the heat balance equations.
Surface heat balance equation of activated metal was established and the accuracy of the models
is verified by experiment. In addition, the comparison of numerical results with the experimental
results by infrared thermal imager demonstrates that the general tendency of numerical is
identical with the experiment.
The manuscript is mostly well written, the method seems to be appropriate and properly
conducted. However, the comparison with previous studies and explanation of the experimental
results are not sufficient. Some more explanations need to be added to make the study more
complete and comprehensible. The authors need to cite some more work from the field, and some
improvements to English. The presentation of this work can be improved and have listed my
suggestions below. At this stage, my recommendation for this manuscript is major revision.
Specific Comments:
1. In the introduction part, the reason and the necessity of the study are not given.
2. In page 2, the authors said “So the pyrophoric reaction of activated metal is not only relative
with chaff velocity but also with activated metal material itself.” It might be helpful to cite the
related references and give more explanations here to make the presentation more convincing.
Same problem is there in page 4 “The temperature gap between surfaces isn’t large, so Qcon is
quite little which could be ignored.”
3. Little references have been cited in results and discussion part. Consequently, the comparison
with previous studies and explanation of the experimental results are not sufficient.
4. In page 2, several studies in this field are listed by the authors, it would be better if more details
of corresponding studies are given.
Other technical comments:
1. In page 3, This sentence doesn't read smoothly. “The amount of holes is n which is uniform
distributed in the activated metal.”
2. The abbreviation CFD appeared in page 1 at the first time of the substract and in page 7 at the
first time of the mainbody without full name.
3. “Because of the combustion process is quite complex, there are many studies on it.” There is no
subject in this sentence. Same problem is there in page 6.
4. In page 5, “The primary reaction is the oxidation Mg in the pyrophoric reaction.” should be
“The primary reaction is the oxidation of Mg in the pyrophoric reaction.”
5. In page 5 “1202.9kJ”. There should be a blank between a number and its unit. Same problem is
there in pages 8, 9, 10, 11, 14 and 16.
6. In page 6, “The oxygen molecules are collision with the wall of the holes all the way during
diffusion.” The “collision” here should be replaced with “colliding”.
4
7. In page 7, “Assume that the surfaces of activated metal can be divided into N in the
combustion” the “Assume” here should be “Assuming”. Same problem is there in pages 2 , 4 and
8.
8. In page 8, the “PIM-PLE” appeared without full name.

Appendix A
Reviewer:1
Thank you very much for your comments to our manuscript, we have revised our
manuscript carefully based on your comments and our manuscript is more enriched,
the logic is more rigorous now. These comments play an important role to enhance the
quality of our manuscript. The replies to your comments in detail are shown as
follows, the related parts have been revised in the paper and marked red.
1. In the abstract, the author claimed “To solve the combustion problem of chaff,…”.
But it is not pointed out what is the detailed problem need to be solved in the
abstract.
The detailed problem need to be solved has been added in the abstract, the detailed
revision is shown as follows,
“The combustion of multi-hole pyrophoric activated metal belongs to solid
combustion and the combustion process is quite complex, which is the difficult
problem need to be solved. At the time of the pyrophoric activated metal contacting
with oxygen, the oxygen diffuses inside the activated metal chaff by plenty of holes
and reacts with it, which increases the contact area with oxygen deeply. The whole
combustion is serious and the temperature rises rapidly.”
The revision parts have been marked red in the paper.
2. In the introduction part, only simply list the reference is not convincing. More
details derived from references related with this research are needed.
The details derived from references have been added in the introduction and
marked red, the detailed revision is shown as follows,
“Wang et al. [2] ignited Al and Ti powder particles by laser beam and Al and Ti
particles were carried by airflow. The airflow pattern was varied from laminar to
turbulent flow. The flow pattern was controlled by computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) models. The brightness of the streak and the combustion temperature of Al
were substantially decreased in turbulent flow, but the decrease was minor for Ti. The
combustion rate increased for both Al and Ti in turbulent flow. Wiharm [1] established
the combustion models of activated metal Fe. The maximal combustion temperature
could be obtained by the models. The combustion temperature increased with velocity
and decreased with altitude. Zenin et al. [3] put Al-Mg alloy particles into a
free-falling combustion chamber and ignited it with a ruby laser and studied the
impact of different ratio of Al and Mg, different pressure and different media on the
combustion. The combustion time, luminescence pulsations, fragmentation and
combustion products were tested. Corcoran et al. [4] ignited and burned the Al and
Mg power in the water vapor and the effect of oxygen and other oxidizing species
could be ignored. They found that the larger size particles burned longer. Gao et al. [5]
studied the primary and secondary combustion of Al-Mg alloy. The products of
primary combustion were collected to simulate the secondary combustion in the high
temperature water vapor tube furnace. It was thought that the Mg in Al-Mg alloy
combusted at first and the Al combusted later. Kochden et al. [6] studied the
combustion of Yb in oxygen. Yb would yield intense luminous flames by adding the
consolidated stoichiometric mixtures in the combustion. They found that the flame
temperature of Yb in oxygen was in the same range as Mg based systems. Yang et al.
[7] proposed a new method for continuously synthesizing metal oxide nanoparticles
by injecting micro-sized metal powder precursors into the flame. They found that the
sizes of oxide nanoparticles were related with the flame temperatures and residence
times. Chen et al. [8] designed a new infrared(IR)/ultraviolet dual color decoy, which
contained oxidant, fuel, energetic binder and additives, which changed spectral
radiation characteristics of the traditional infrared decoy. The new color decoy was
consistent with the real fighter target in radiation intensity.”
3. In the eq.(2.4), the z=L(t) is the explained as the surface of activated metal. It is
confusing. Does z stand for the height of surface position?
L(t) is the height of activated metal and z stands for the distance between arbitrary
point inside activated metal chaff and inert substrate. The value of z varies from 0 to
L(t). z=0 is the surface of inert substrate material, while z=L(t) is the surface of
activated metal. C ( z ) is the oxygen concentration of the hole inside activated metal
whose distance to inert substrate is z. The interpretation of z is shown in figure 1.

The interpretation of z is added in part 2 and marked red.
4. In P6 L17-20, it is suggested to state the values for mean free path length of
diffusing molecules(O2, etc.) and compare with the hole diameter.
The mean diameter of the hole is only 1.5*10-8m, which is less than the mean free
path length of oxygen (The mean free path length of oxygen is 6.59*10-8m at standard
conditions).
The revision parts has been added in page 7 and marked red.
5. In P6, please correct the unit of Boltzmann constant.
The unit of Boltzmann constant has been revised in P6 and marked red.
6. In the figure 3, the axis title for x and y should be labeled. It is also suggested to
use the same y-axis range for (a)-(d) figures to compare the results.
The axis title for x and y have been labeled in Fig. 3 and Fig. 6.
7. In the figure 5, the temperature distribution from IR thermograph is not clearly
presented. Please explain more details and try to enhance the figure resolution.
We added detailed interpretation in part 4.1 to explain figure 5 and the resolution of
the figure has been enhanced. The detailed interpretation is shown as follows,
“Figure 5 is the gray level distribution of activated metal chaff at different
velocities tested by IR thermal imager. The gray level varies from 0 to 255. The gray
level of white area is larger and the temperature is higher at the same time. However,
the gray level of black area is smaller and the temperature is lower. It can be obtained
from figure 5 that the white area is largest at the velocity of 0.2 Ma. So the high
temperature area of chaff is the largest and the combustion temperature is highest at
the velocity of 0.2 Ma. It can be known from 4.3.3 that the activated metal chaff can’t
reach the highest temperature at the time of 0.3 s when the velocity is less than 0.2 Ma,
so the gray level of chaff is small. But the heat convection enhances when the velocity
is more than 0.2 Ma and the gray level of the chaff isn’t large enough.”
The revision parts has been added in page 13 and marked red.
8. In part 4.1, more discussion is needed in this part to interpret the increase of
reaction rate with velocity.
The interpretation of the increase of reaction rate with velocity has been added in
part 4.1. The detailed content is shown as follows,
“The activated metal chaff will consume a lot of oxygen in the reaction and the
concentration of oxygen decreases rapidly. So the reaction rate goes down. The
oxygen consumed by activated metal will be supplied soon when the velocity of
airflow increases and the concentration of oxygen on the surface of chaff is increased,
so does the reaction rate. So the pyrophoric reaction rate increases with velocity.
But the combustion temperature of activated metal chaff is related with the energy
generated by activated metal and heat convection. The reaction rate increases with
velocity, but the heat convection increases at the same time. So the combustion
temperature can’t increase with the velocity. This part will be analyzed in 4.3
detailedly.”
The revision parts have been marked red in the paper.
9. In the part 4.3.4, please offer the detailed values for the errors. The maximal and
minimal temperature of surface seems not to be negligible between experimental
and numerical results.
(1) In the part 4.3.4, please offer the detailed values for the errors.
The detailed values for the errors have been added in part 4.3.4 and the revised
parts have been marked red, The detailed content is shown as follows,
“The numerical with experimental results in figure 7 to figure 9 are compared and
the errors are computed. Figure 10 are the errors of the maximal and minimal surface
temperature at the maximal radiation intensity of chaff. Figure 11 are the errors of
radiation intensity at 0.8 Ma. Figure 12 is the error of time when chaff reaches the
maximal radiation intensity.

Figure 12. The error of time.
The errors in figure 10 are positive and the errors in figure 12 are negative, but the
errors aren’t large. The combustion rate of numerical is faster than experimental, so
the numerical combustion is more serious and the temperature is larger than
experiment. However, the total amount of activated metal is invariant, so the
numerical time when chaff reaches the maximal temperature is less than experiment.
The errors in figure 11 are quite large, the errors rise to 100% firstly, then decrease to
-100% rapidly and tend to be stable lastly.
The errors in figure 11 are the comparison of numerical and experimental radiation
intensity at the same time. Because of the combustion rate of numerical is faster than
experiment, the chaff reaches the maximal temperature firstly in numerical
computation. Temperature is larger than experiment all the time in the process of rise,
so the errors rise rapidly at first. The time of experiment when chaff reaches the
maximal temperature is longer than numerical computation and the experimental
combustion rate is slower than numerical, so the surplus activated metal in experiment
is more than numerical computation when chaff reaches the maximal temperature,
what make the temperature decrease rate is slower. The experimental temperature is
larger than numerical soon in the decrease process and the errors decrease quickly. As
the combustion is asynchronous, it’s inappropriate to compare the numerical radiation
intensity with experiment at the same time. The large errors in figure 11 can’t verify
the numerical computation is in accurate. However, it can be obtained from figure 10
and figure 12 that the numerical results are quite accurate, the combustion models are
credible.”
(2) The maximal and minimal temperature of surface seems not to be negligible
between experimental and numerical results.
It can be obtained from figure 2 that there exists temperature gap among surfaces
when the velocity is larger than 68m/s and the gap increases with velocity. The
aerodynamic heating increases with velocity, however, the impact of aerodynamic
heating isn’t identical among the surfaces of chaff. The impact of aerodynamic
heating is obvious in the leading edge of chaff and the temperature is high. Because of
the difference of surface temperature distribution, there exists a gap with the surface
radiance. The temperature gap can’t be ignored in the combustion. The surface heat
balance equation established in the paper is mainly to research the difference of the
surface temperature distribution.
We ignore heat conduction Qcon , which is mainly generated by the temperature gap
between the surface and other surfaces nearby. The temperature gap mainly arises
from adiabatic wall temperature computed by CFD. But the adiabatic wall
temperature is continuous and the temperature gap is little between the surface and
other surfaces nearby. Because of the continuous of aerodynamic heating, we ignore
Qcon [10],[11].

Reviewer:2
Thank you very much for your comments to our manuscript, we have revised our
manuscript carefully based on your comments and our manuscript is more enriched,
the logic is more rigorous now. These comments play an important role to enhance the
quality of our manuscript. The replies to your comments in detail are shown as
follows, the related parts have been revised in the paper and marked red.
1. In the introduction part, the reason and the necessity of the study are not given.
We have added the reason and necessity of the study in the introduction. The
detailed content is shown as follows,
“Surface-type infrared decoy is compressed by thousands of chaffs. The chaff
diffuses rapidly under the impact of high speed airflow. The chaff is composed of
multi-hole activated metal and will combust in the air. So the research about the
combustion of multi-hole activated metal is very necessary, which will impact on the
radiation characteristics of surface-type infrared decoy”
The revision parts have been marked red in the paper.
2. In page2, the authors said “ So the pyrophoric reaction of activated metal is not
only relative with chaff velocity but also with activated metal material itself.” It
might be helpful to cite the related references andQgive
con more explanations here to
make the presentation more convincing. Same problem is there in page 4 “The
temperature gap between surfaces isn’t large, so is quite little which could be
ignored.”
(1) “So the pyrophoric reaction of activated metal is not only relative with chaff
velocity but also with activated metal material itself.” It might be helpful to cite the
related references and give more explanations here to make the presentation more
convincing.
The activated metal determines the value of reaction enthalpy and how much the
energy generated by combustion, which will impact on the combustion process and
temperature ultimately. The activated metal chaff will consume a lot of oxygen in the
reaction and the concentration of oxygen is decreases rapidly. So the reaction rate
goes down. The oxygen consumed by activated metal will be supplied soon when the
velocity of airflow increases and the concentration of oxygen on the surface of chaff
is increased, so does the reaction rate. So the pyrophoric reaction of activated metal is
not only relative with chaff velocity but also with activated metal material itself. 1
The detailed explanations are added in page 2 and weQhave con cited the related
reference. The revision parts have been marked red.
(2) The temperature gap between surfaces isn’t large, so is quite little which
could be ignored.
It can be obtained that there exists temperature gap among surfaces when the
velocity is larger than 68m/s. The temperature gap among surfaces is only 19 K at 1
Ma. The temperature gap mainly arises from adiabatic wall temperature computed by
CFD. But the adiabatic wall temperature is continuous and the temperature gap is
little between the surface and other surfaces nearby. The related references are 10 and
11. Heat conduction Qcon is mainly generated by the temperature gap between the
surface and other surfaces nearby. Because of the continuous of aerodynamic heating,
we ignore Qcon . Qcon is also ignored in references 10 and 11.
The detailed explanations are added in page 5 and we have cited the related
reference. The revision parts have been marked red.
3. Little references have been cited in results and discussion part. Consequently, the
comparison with previous studies and explanation of the experimental results are
not sufficient.
(1) Little references have been cited in results and discussion part.
We have added the cited references in 4.3.1 and 4.1.
(2) Consequently, the comparison with previous studies and explanation of the
experimental results are not sufficient.
The thermodynamics equations of combustion models are established in the paper,
but the open references about combustion models of activated metal are very less. So
we can’t compare the results with previous studies. The reference [1] is about the
establishment of combustion models. However, the reduction of activated metal is not
contained in the combustion. It can only obtained the maximal temperature by the
models. The results obtained in reference [1] are far from the results in the paper, so
the results comparison is not contained. We have added the comparion with previous
studies in the introduction part, which is shown as follows,
“Most previous studies are about the combustion characteristics of activated metal,
and the studies about the combustion models about pyrophoric activated metal are less.
The combustion models are established in reference [1], but the reduction of activated
metal is not contained in the combustion. It can only obtained the maximal
temperature by the models. The variation of the mass of activated metal with oxygen
consumption and the impact of the adiabatic wall computed by CFD on combustion
temperature are studied and the surface combustion models of activated metal are
established based on the research in reference [1] in this work. The combustion
temperature of any surface at any time and the temperature gap of surfaces can be
obtained by the model.”
We have added the errors analysis of figure 7 to figure 9 in 4.3.4 to explain the
experimental results detailed. The detailed revision is shown as follows,
“The numerical with experimental results in figure 7 to figure 9 are compared and
the errors are computed. Figure 10 are the errors of the maximal and minimal surface
temperature at the maximal radiation intensity of chaff. Figure 11 are the errors of
radiation intensity at 0.8 Ma. Figure 12 is the error of time when chaff reaches the
maximal radiation intensity.

4. In page 2, several studies in this field are listed by authors, it would be better if
more details of corresponding studies are given.
The details derived from references have been added in the introduction and
marked red, the detailed revision is shown as follows,
“Wang et al. [2] ignited Al and Ti powder particles by laser beam and Al and Ti
particles were carried by airflow. The airflow pattern was varied from laminar to
turbulent flow. The flow pattern was controlled by computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) models. The brightness of the streak and the combustion temperature of Al
were substantially decreased in turbulent flow, but the decrease was minor for Ti. The
combustion rate increased for both Al and Ti in turbulent flow and Al increased more
rate than Ti. Wiharm [1] established the combustion models of activated metal Fe.
The maximal combustion temperature could be obtained by the models. The
combustion temperature increased with velocity and decreased with altitude. Zenin et
al. [3] put Al-Mg alloy particles into a free-falling combustion chamber and ignited it
with a ruby laser and studied the impact of different ratio of Al and Mg, different
pressure and different media on the combustion. The combustion time, luminescence
pulsations, fragmentation and combustion products were tested. Corcoran et al. [4] A.
Corcoran ignited and burned the Al and Mg power in the water vapor and the effect of
oxygen and other oxidizing species could be ignored. They found that the larger size
particles burned longer. Gao et al. [5] studied the primary and secondary combustion
Al-Mg alloy. The products of primary combustion were collected to simulate the
secondary combustion in the high temperature water vapor tube furnace. It was
thought that the Mg in Al-Mg alloy combusted first and the Al combusted later.
Kochden et al. [6] studied the combustion of Yb in oxygen. Yb would yield intense
luminous flames by adding the consolidated stoichiometric mixtures in the
combustion. They found that the flame temperature of Yb in oxygen was in the same
range as Mg based systems. Yang et al. [7] proposed a new method for continuously
synthesizing metal oxide nanoparticles by injecting micro-sized metal powder
precursors into the flame. They found that the sizes of oxide nanoparticles were
related with the flame temperatures and residence times. Chen et al. [8] designed a
new infrared(IR)/ultraviolet dual color decoy, which contained oxidant, fuel, energetic
binder and additives, which changed spectral radiation characteristics of the
traditional infrared decoy. The new color decoy was consistent with the real fighter
target in radiation intensity.”
Other technical comments:

“The amount of holes is n which is uniform distributed in the activated metal.” has
been revised as “The holes are uniform distributed in the activated metal with the
amount of n”. The revision has been marked red.
2. The abbreviation CFD appeared in page 1 at the first time of the abstract and in
page 7 at the first time of the main body without full name.

page 1 and page 2. The revision has been marked red.
3. “Because of the combustion process is quite complex, there are many studies on
it.” There is no subject in this sentence. Same problem is there in page 6.
“Because of the combustion process is quite complex, there are many studies on it.”
has been revised as “the combustion process is quite complex, so there are many

In page 6 “Because of the diameter of hole on the surface of activated metal is quite
small, which is on the same order of magnitude as the mean free path length of the
diffusing molecules.” has been revised as “The mean diameter of the hole is only
1.5*10-8m, which is less than the mean free path length of oxygen (The mean free
path length of oxygen is 6.59*10-8m at standard conditions).”
The revision has been marked red.

The blank has been added between number and unit in page5,8,9,10,11,14 and 16.
6. In page 6, “The oxygen molecules are collision with the wall of the holes all the

In page 6, the sentence has been revised and marked red.
7. In page 7, “Assume that the surfaces of activated metal can be divided into N in
the combustion” the “Assume” here should be “Assuming”. Same problem is
there in pages 2,4 and 8.
“Assume” has been revised as “Assuming” in page 2,4,7 and 8.
8. In page 8, the “PIM-PLE” appeared without full name.
The full name of “PIM-PLE” is pressure-implicit with splitting of operators

Dear reviewer:
Thank you very much for your comments to our manuscript, we have checked the
format and improved the English of the manuscript. We have revised the English of
our manuscript carefully based on your comments. Now, the logic is more rigorous,
the idea is more clear. These comments play an important role to enhance the quality
of our manuscript. The replies to your comments in detail are shown as follows, the
related parts have been revised in the paper and marked red.
1. There should be a blank between number and its unit.
We have check the manuscript carefully and added a blank between number and its
unit. Such as, in page 5, page 8.
2. In page 1, the authors said that “So the research about the combustion of multi-hole
activated metal is very necessary, which will impact on the radiation characteristics of
surface-type infrared decoy”, which doesn’t read smoothly.
The specific revision is shown as
“Hence, the radiation characteristics of surface-type IR decoy is affected by the
combustion of multi-hole activated metal. This results in an active research field for
the combustion of multi-hole activated metal.”
The revision has been marked red in the paper.
3. Authors should carefully check the format and English of the article.
The format has been revised according to the requirement of the journal. We
have revised the English in the manuscript carefully, the revision has been marked red.
Some of the revisions are shown as follow
(1) “and the studies about the combustion models about pyrophoric activated metal
are less” in page 3 has been revised as “however, less attention is paid to pyrophoric
activated metal.”
(2) “The variation of the mass of activated metal with oxygen consumption and the
impact of the adiabatic wall computed by CFD on combustion temperature are studied
and the surface combustion models of activated metal are established based on the
research in reference [1] in this work.” in page 4 has been revised as “In this paper,
the surface combustion model of the activated metal is established based on the work
in [1]. Two new factors are taken into account, namely the variation of the mass of the
activated metal with oxygen consumption and the impact of the adiabatic wall
computed by CFD on the combustion temperature.”
(3) “Pyrophoric activated metal Mg is used to study activated metal chaff surface
combustion characteristics in this work.” in page 4 has been revised as “Mg, as a
classical kind of pyrophoric activated metals, is used to study activated metal chaff
surface combustion characteristics in this work.”
(4) “Firstly, the combustion energy Qin should be solved.” in page 5 has been
revised as “To solve the equation in (2.1), the combustion energy Qin is deduced
firstly.”
(5) “The mass flux of oxygen transport to the surface of activated metal by bulk
diffusion and by bulk mass transport are same, which should satisfies the following
equation: ” in page 5 has been revised as “There are two forms for the mass flux of
oxygen transported to the surface of the activated metal, the one is bulk diffusion and
the other is bulk mass transport. These forms satisfy the following equation”
(6) “The expression of oxygen concentration C (z) is obtained by the integral of
equation (2.7), which satisfies the following equation:” in page 7 has been revised as
“Double integrating both sides of equation (2.7), we have”
(7) “So the obstacle of the diffusion is very heavy. Otherwise, the concentration of
oxygen is less with the diffusion, what obstructs the reaction rate further.” in page 8
has been revised as “Thus, it is difficult for oxygen molecules to diffuse in the holes
of the activated metal. On the other hand, the concentration of oxygen reduces
continuously in the process of diffusion, which further obstructs the reaction rate.”
(8) “Mass flux of oxygen J o 2 can be obtained by the integral of equation (2.7), which
is:” in page 8 has been revised as “By the integral of equation (2.7) yields”
(9) “ Qenv is the energy generates by surface i absorbing the environmental radiation,
which is given by:” in page 8 has been revised as “The energy Qenv generated by
surface i is”
(10) “The heat convection between surface i and the air shouldn’t only take the heat
dissipation effect of high speed airflow into account, but the aerodynamic heating
must be considered. So the heat convection should be established between surface i
and the adiabatic wall, which is given by:” in page 9 has been revised as “To discuss
the heat convection between surface i and the air, not only the heat dissipation effect
of high speed airflow, but also the aerodynamic heating must be considered. Equation
(2.19) is the heat convection equation of surface i, which contains the aerodynamic
heating”
(11) “Equation (2.10) is put into the integral of equation (2.21), that is:” in page 9 has
been revised as “Substituting equation (2.10) into the integral of equation (2.21)
yields”
(12) “However, the gray level of black area is smaller and the temperature is lower.”
in page 9 has been revised as “On the other hand, the gray level of black area is
opposite to the characteristics in the white area.”
(13) “So the high temperature area of chaff is the largest and the combustion
temperature is highest at the velocity of 0.2 Ma.” in page 13 has been revised as
“Therefore, the high temperature area of the chaff is the largest and the combustion
temperature is the highest.”
(14) “But the heat convection enhances when the velocity is more than 0.2 Ma and the
gray level of the chaff isn’t large enough.” in page 13 has been revised as “As the
Mach Number Ma <U+F03E> 0.2 , the heat convection enhances while the gray level of the
chaff is not improved as expected.”
(15) “The time when the radiation intensity of chaff reaches the maximum is inversely
proportional to the velocity in combustion,” in page 17 has been revised as “The
required time for the chaff to reach the maximum radiation intensity is inversely
proportional to the airflow velocity in combustion,”
(16) “Figure 10 are the errors of the maximal and minimal surface temperature at the
maximal radiation intensity of chaff. Figure 11 are the errors of radiation intensity at
0.8 Ma. Figure 12 is the error of time when chaff reaches the maximal radiation
intensity.” in page 17 has been revised as “Figure 10 shows that the errors of the
maximal and minimal surface temperature at the maximal radiation intensity of the
chaff. Figure 11 indicates that the errors of radiation intensity with the Mach Number
Ma <U+F03D> 0.8 . Figure 12 gives out the error of the required time for the chaff to reach the
maximal radiation intensity.”
(17) “Because of the combustion rate of numerical is faster than experiment, the chaff
reaches the maximal temperature firstly in numerical computation.” in page 18 has
been revised as “Compared with experiment results, the combustion rate of numerical
is faster, thus the chaff reaches the maximal temperature more quickly.”
(18) “The time of experiment when chaff reaches the maximal temperature is longer
than numerical computation and the experimental combustion rate is slower than
numerical,” in page 18 has been revised as “When the chaff reaches the maximal
temperature, the required time of experiment is longer than the numerical one, then
the experimental combustion rate is slower than numerical. Therefore,”
(19) “The experimental temperature is larger than numerical soon in the decrease
process and the errors decrease quickly.” in page 18 has been revised as “The
experimental temperature in the reduction process becomes larger quickly and then
the errors decrease.”
(20) “The cylindrical holes which are vertical with the surface of activated metal and
in favour of the diffusion of oxygen are applied to solve the surface heat balance
equation in the numerical computation.” in page 19 has been revised as “Dealing with
the surface heat balance equation, we assume that the cylindrical holes are vertical
with respect to the surface of the activated metal in the numerical computation, which
is in favor of the diffusion of oxygen.”
