This is a well written paper on a new catalytic application of a heterogeneous organocatalyst,
namely carbon nitride. Usually azine click reactions need basic conditions and Cu- complexes,
but here, a heterogeneous support decorated with Cu-nanoparticles can do the same, with the
obvious advantages of a purer, Cu-free product. The CU nanoparticles are "hyperactivated" by
light to the support, which adds electron density to the copper.
This is new, useful, and very creative.
My only little concern is that the authors should disprove leaching to the homogeneous medium
by photocorrosion. i.e. please check or describe if molecular copper complexes can be excluded,
colour or traditional Cu-tests are usually a good criterium

This is interesting of work from the authors, where they prepared g-CN-Cu NPs for the synthesis
of 1,2,3-triazole derivatives under light irradiation without any base. The catalyst is well
characterized and explained in details including mechanistic aspects. Also, the substrate scope is
well explored. This article should be accepted after following revision.
I did not see reusability of this catalyst, I would suggest checking it and also leaching of Cu?
After this study corresponding text, should alter in the abstract and conclusion.
Following important articles on copper nanoparticles are missing; they should be including in the
revised MS.
