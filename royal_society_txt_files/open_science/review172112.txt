The determination of the optimal EGR rate needs to be pre-calibrated by the diesel engine
performance prediction software, and then finally calibrated on the original machine, which
requires a lot of manpower, material and financial resources. In this paper, a multi-objective grey
decision method for uncertainty optimized modeling in exhaust gas recirculation performance
evaluation was proposed and a simulation optimization platform was designed and established.
The experimental study has illustrated the proposed method can effectively solve the dependence
on subjective judgment in the current multi-objective optimization process of diesel engines in
comparison with the existing methods, it shows certain academic research value for
determination of optimal EGR rate under different working conditions.
Comments:
1. Is it possible to add some quantitative data in the abstract ? such as the optimal EGR rate range
under different conditions?
2. In Table 2, the working conditions corresponding to OP1—0P6 should be specified (such as
speed and load rate).
3. On page 16, the author discusses that “ This finding is consistent with the characteristics of
EGR performance for current turbocharged diesel engine and demonstrates the effectiveness of
the optimization method.” However, the research by Zhang[10] cited by the author in the

simulation platform can effectively improve the efficiency of simulation calculation,", this
conclusion lacks effective support and the author should give some comparison data for

EGR performance evaluation is one challenge for diesel engine optimization and how to
determine the optimal EGR rate is an urgent problem to be solved. Normally it is needs to be pre-
calibrated by the performance prediction software, then calibrated on the original machine, this
process usually cost a large number of manpower, material and financial resources.
In this paper, an optimized performance evaluation and decision-making method based on grey
theory and entropy weight is proposed. It provides a good idea for diesel engine performance
research and the simulation results has illustrated the feasibility of the proposed method. I have
some comments regards to this paper as follows:
1. The writing is suggested to be improved by aid of some native English speakers.
2. On page 4, lines 54, the author proposes that the method is applicable to large data and poor
data cases. According to my understanding, the meaning of the sentence is that a small number of
data samples can be used to obtain similar rules as large data samples. However, it has not been
reflected in "4.2 analysis of results " . Please explain it.
3. On page 8, lines 12-34, the author provide a description of how to determine the NOX weight.
What is the theoretical basis for determining the NOx weight? The author should add some
detailed description.
4. In Table 2 , all parameters has no units and the operating conditions are not specified. Please
add it .
5. Part of results analysis are not preciseness. i.e. on page 15, lines 18, when diesel engine is under
low speed conditions, we should ensure not only dynamic performance but also economic
performance. The same problem exists in " <U+2161>. High speed conditions " and " <U+2162>. Medium speed
conditions ". Please check and modify.
6. In order to make better use of this method, it is recommended that the authors combine the
decision objectives with current emissions regulations and utilize the emission regulations as a
constraint to optimize dynamic and economic indicators.

The paper presents an optimized multi-objective grey decision method based on grey theory and
entropy weight. The subject of this paper is much interesting (in passing, I am personally
interested in multi-objective problems), it is meaningful for engineering application of grey
theory. There are some comments on your paper after review:
1. The content in "1. Fundamentals of Grey Theory" should be simplified, as it is the basic model
in grey theory that well-known , I suggest the author make appropriate deletions.
2. The variables and functions in this paper should be defined accurately. i.e., on page 6 lines 23,
the variable is inconsistent with Formula (4).
3. In this paper, the author provide an optimized algorithm for decision-making model. Why do
author define the NOX weight 0.3, 0.4 or 0.5? The author should explain in detail. Moreover, I
recommend a detailed explanation of the result analysis on different weights to illustrate the
rationality of the weighting method.
4. The author proposes the "initial subjective weight vector", "objective weight vector" and
"comprehensive weight vector " in this paper. I suggest the author check and confirm if these
variables are vectors? not scalars?
5. Some content in "4.2 Analysis of results" needs to be modified to make the conclusions more
rigorous. i.e., on page 14 lines 40-43, the author concludes that : 4.6%>8.6%> 2.4%>10.4%> 11.6%?
Intuitively, this expression is not logical. I suggest the author re-edit it.

Appendix A
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers' comments concerning my manuscript entitled
" Optimized modelling and Application of EGR Performance Evaluation of Turbocharged
Diesel Engine "(ID: RSOS-172112).
I am very grateful to your valuable advice and the comments are all helpful for revising and
improving my paper, as well as the important guiding significance to my researches. I have
studied comments carefully and have made correction which we hope meet with approval.
Revised portion are marked in red in the paper. The main corrections in the paper and the responds
to the reviewer’s comments are as flowing:
Reviewer #1
Comment #1: Is it possible to add some quantitative data in the abstract ? such as the
optimal EGR rate range under different conditions?
Response:
Thanks for your comment.
The author wants to express in the abstract is that the basic laws obtained through this
method are consistent with current EGR control principles. However, due to the restriction of test
condition, the test data is very limited(the maximum EGR rate does not exceed 15%), it is not
appropriate to define a range of the best EGR rate base on a small amount of data.
In addition, as the test diesel model and program are different, the measured EGR operating
point is different and the range of best EGR rate is naturally different, so it is difficult to use a
unified quantitative standard.
Therefore, the authors believe that as long as the basic control principles are consistent, it
means the method is correct and feasible.
Comment #2: In Table 2, the working conditions corresponding to OP1—0P6 should be
specified (such as speed and load rate).
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
The detailed description of the operating points has been added in table 2.
Comment #3:On page 16, the author discusses that “ This finding is consistent with the
characteristics of EGR performance for current turbocharged diesel engine and demonstrates
the effectiveness of the optimization method.” However, the research by Zhang[10] cited by the
author in the introduction gives the opposite conclusion. Is this conclusion rigorous?
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
As described in the introduction, there is no absolute standard for the best EGR rate at
present and different researchers establish different principles. The reference [10] gives the
conclusion that “high EGR rate should be selected at low load condition and small EGR rate
should be selected at high load condition”. This is because the author just take the PM emission
does not exceed the original machine as the basic principle to determine the optimal EGR rate, so
the conclusions obtained are different from the general laws. However, the results in this paper are
based on the universal principle of EGR control. Therefore, it is unavoidable to differ from the
conclusions drawn by individual scholars, which do not affect the feasibility of the method
proposed in this paper.
Comment #4: In the third part of the conclusion, the author proposed that " ... and the
optimization simulation platform can effectively improve the efficiency of simulation
calculation,", this conclusion lacks effective support and the author should give some
comparison data for computational efficiency.
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
At present, the gray decision-making, gray correlation analysis and other models are
implemented using programming, such as MATLAB language. However, repeated calling
programs will bring inconvenience to simulation calculations and are not conducive to practical
applications.
Therefore, the author established a human-computer interaction interface through the GUIDE
platform. In this way, the user only needs to input the original data, and through a simple initial
setting, the final evaluation result can be directly obtained, Compared with the means of
programming, the optimized simulation platform is easier to realize and more efficient for
engineering applications.
Comment #5: The written English should be modified carefully throughout the paper to
avoid grammatical errors in sentences.
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
I am very sorry for my incorrect writing and the written English is modified carefully by an
expert.
Comment #6: All of the references should be written at the same format. Also, please check
the journal format..
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
The references is modified carefully.
Reviewer #2
Comment #1: The writing is suggested to be improved by aid of some native English
speakers.
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
I am very sorry for my incorrect writing and the written English is modified carefully by an
expert.
Comment #2: On page 4, lines 54, the author proposes that the method is applicable to
large data and poor data cases. According to my understanding, the meaning of the sentence is
that a small number of data samples can be used to obtain similar rules as large data samples.
However, it has not been reflected in "4.2 analysis of results " . Please explain it..
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
Multi-objective gray decision method is a branch of the grey system theory and the most
important advantage is that it is not limited to the data, especially for some small sample decision
problems. Due to the restriction of test condition, the test data is very limited (the maximum EGR
rate does not exceed 15%). In this case, the traditional method cannot meet the requirements and
how to comprehensively evaluate the performance of different EGR rates is critical, which is the
main research background of this paper. The final results show that this method can effectively
solve this problem. Of course, if there is sufficient data, the author believes that this method is still
valid because their implementation principle is the same. Therefore, the method is applicable to
large data and poor data cases.
Comment #3: On page 8, lines 12-34, the author provide a description of how to determine
the NOX weight. What is the theoretical basis for determining the NOx weight? The author
should add some detailed description.
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
The detailed process of establishment of NOX weight is added in" 2.2.1 Establishment of
NOX Weight " (marked in red)
At present, the basic principles of marine diesel engine EGR control are as follows:
When diesel engine is under idling and warming condition, no EGR cycle is used; When
diesel engine is under low-load condition, a smaller EGR rate is used. When the diesel engine is
under over-acceleration condition, the lower EGR rate should be adopted. As the load increases,
the EGR rate should also increase accordingly, but it must be controlled within a certain range.
When diesel engine is under high speeds and high loads condition, a larger EGR rates should be
adopted.
Based on the above principles, firstly, assuming that the five decision targets are equally
important. Therefore, each initial weights is 0.2 and the initial decision making results can be
obtained. Analyzing the results and comparing with the actual optimization features of EGR, the
value of can be adjusted by adverse deduce. the value of are 0.2, 0.25, 0.27.0.3, 0.31, 0.32,
0.33, 0.34, 0.35, 0.36, 0.37, 0.38, 0.39, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50 in order, the final comprehensive
optimization weight varies depending on the value of . Take OP1 as an example for illustration.

It can be seen from the table that When = 0.3, the comprehensive evaluation value
corresponding to low EGR rate is low, and the comprehensive evaluation value obtained by high
EGR rate is the lowest, which means that high EGR rate should not be adopted under low speed
conditions. When 0.3= = 0.4, the comprehensive evaluation value of high EGR rate is increased.
When= 0.36, the comprehensive evaluation value of the high EGR rate is higher than that of lower
EGR rate. which shows that a higher EGR rate should be adopted. However, this is inconsistent
with the EGR characteristics of marine diesel engines. Particularly when =0.4, the
comprehensive evaluation value of high EGR rate <U+F068>is obviously higher than that of low EGR rate.

Obviously , it is unreasonable. Therefore, when the diesel engine is in low speed condition, the
value of is 0.3.

Because of the limited experimental data, more rigorous verification are needed when
determine NOX weights. However, the author believes that it does not affect the core ideas and
feasibility of this method. The main purpose of the author is to try to explore a new method that
can contribute to EGR performance evaluation and optimization research.

Comment #4: In Table 2 , all parameters has no units and the operating conditions are not
specified. Please add it ..
<U+F068>3
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
The units has been added and the operating conditions are defined in Table 2
Comment #5: Part of results analysis are not preciseness. i.e. on page 15, lines 18, when
diesel engine is under low speed conditions, we should ensure not only dynamic performance
but also economic performance. The same problem exists in " <U+2161>. High speed conditions " and
" <U+2162>. Medium speed conditions ". Please check and modify..
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
The problems that expert mentioned have been modified in results analysis.
Comment #6: In order to make better use of this method, it is recommended that the
authors combine the decision objectives with current emissions regulations and utilize the
emission regulations as a constraint to optimize dynamic and economic indicators..
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
First of all, I agree with the expert's opinion. At the beginning of this study, the author
considered to combine the existing emission regulations with the optimization model, so that the
optimized model can be closer to the actual situation.
At present, in order to meet the latest IMO Tier II regulations, the main measures at present
are high pressure common rail + two-stage variable boost + multiple injection + EGR. However,
in this paper, the test model was a modified TBD234V12 sequential supercharged diesel engine,
and only the sequential supercharging system and EGR was equipped. Therefore, there is no way
to meet the latest emission regulations . As a result, the author give up the original idea and try to
reflect the actual characteristics of EGR by the means of decision target weighting. The control
principles that commonly adopted in current marine diesel engines are used to constrain the
optimization of the model and ensure the practicality of the method. The author believes that the
purpose of this way is the same as that proposed by the expert, that is, it can be more applicable to
practical applications.
Reviewer #3
Comment #1: The content in "1. Fundamentals of Grey Theory" should be simplified, as it
is the basic model in grey theory that well-known , I suggest the author make appropriate
deletions..
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
The basic theory description in " Fundamentals of grey theory" was moderately deleted. As
the gray decision-making is less applied in the field of diesel engine, so some necessary
descriptions are retained to make the readers easier to understand.
Comment #2: The variables and functions in this paper should be defined accurately. i.e.,
on page 6 lines 23, the variable is inconsistent with Formula (4).
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
The variables and functions in the full text were carefully examined and carefully modified
Comment #3: In this paper, the author provide an optimized algorithm for
decision-making model. Why do author define the NOX weight 0.3, 0.4 or 0.5? The author
should explain in detail. Moreover, I recommend a detailed explanation of the result analysis
on different weights to illustrate the rationality of the weighting method.
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
The detailed process of establishment of NOX weight is added in" 2.2.1 Establishment of
NOX Weight " (marked in red), the explanation of the result analysis on different weights is added
in "4.2.1 Low speed conditions"(marked in red).
At present, the basic principles of marine diesel engine EGR control are as follows:
When diesel engine is under idling and warming condition, no EGR cycle is used; When
diesel engine is under low-load condition, a smaller EGR rate is used. When the diesel engine is
under over-acceleration condition, the lower EGR rate should be adopted. As the load increases,
the EGR rate should also increase accordingly, but it must be controlled within a certain range.
When diesel engine is under high speeds and high loads condition, a larger EGR rates should be
adopted.
Based on the above principles, firstly, assuming that the five decision targets are equally
important. Therefore, each initial weights is 0.2 and the initial decision making results can be
obtained. Analyzing the results and comparing with the actual optimization features of EGR, the
value of can be adjusted by adverse deduce. the value of are 0.2, 0.25, 0.27.0.3, 0.31, 0.32,
0.33, 0.34, 0.35, 0.36, 0.37, 0.38, 0.39, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50 in order, the final comprehensive
optimization weight varies depending on the value of . Take OP1 as an example for illustration.
the relationship between different weights for optimization result is shown in the following table:

Comment #4: The author proposes the "initial subjective weight vector", "objective weight
vector" and "comprehensive weight vector " in this paper. I suggest the author check and
confirm if<U+F068>these variables are vectors? not scalars?

Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
I am very sorry for these mistakes, these variables are scalars and I have been modified it.
Comment #5: Some content in "4.2 Analysis of results" needs to be modified to make the
conclusions more rigorous. i.e., on page 14 lines 40-43, the author concludes that : 4.6%>8.6%>
2.4%>10.4%> 11.6%? Intuitively, this expression is not logical. I suggest the author re-edit it..
Response:
Thank you very much for your comments.
The expression is re-edited carefully and the revised expression is:
" It can also be seen from the results the performance ranking of different EGR rates under
OP1 condition is:4.6%, 8.6%, 2.4%, 10.4%,11.6%, and the optimal EGR rate is 4.6%. "
