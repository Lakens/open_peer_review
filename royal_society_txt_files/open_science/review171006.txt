Review RSOS 171006
The manuscript by Ishizuka and colleagues reports on some finding from research on bonobos at
one of the very few field sites studying this important great ape. It is thus important data,
especially as it encompasses information on two groups.
This paper addresses two questions: 1) male reproductive skew in wild bonobos and 2) average
relatedness of males and females within and across groups.
The Introduction is very limited, focuses almost entirely upon bonobos, and although the authors
state that it is necessary to ‘reveal patterns of kinships and reproductive consequences to
understand the social system of a target species’ they do not spell out why this is interesting or
necessary. In addition, the two questions addressed in this paper are not convincingly linked to
one another, and the authors should explain to the reader in more detail how sex-biased dispersal
patterns are expected to affect same sex affiliative patterns, and how this may be reflected in
average relatedness levels, with citations of literature beyond bonobos. Then it is necessary to
link the dispersal patterns to male reproductive competition and the potential role of the mothers
in influencing their sons’ reproductive success in this male philopatric society.
The last sentence of the Abstract should be removed as it is confusing- it seems to suggest there is
an analysis of dyadic female interactions and the role of kinship.
Additional comments
1. lines 67-70: it is an exaggeration to say that the results from Lomako and LuiKotale are ‘not
consistent’, which maybe makes it sound like error is involved, when these numbers are expected
to vary due to many potential factors including number of competing males, stability of social
group, number of simultaneously estrous females, the time span of the study etc.
2. I see that there were some 77 individuals in the three groups in 2014. I am surprised that only
86 + 7 samples were used in this study. This means that nearly all individuals were only
represented by data from a single sample. How did the authors confirm the identity of the
samples?
3. line 185 so the allele frequencies were estimated using data from all individuals, correct?
4. Table 1: this is at which point in time?
5. Reporting the skew index for group E1 would allow for direct comparison with the recent
work by Surbeck et al.
6. line 237 section Pairwise relatedness
Please clarify that the comparisons involve adults and adolescents only.
3
7. Figure 2 would be more effective if the identity of the other primates was specified in the
legend.
8. .lines 313-314 with regard to the question of whether males within or across great ape groups
are more closely related, there are other papers that show using genetic evidence that western
gorilla males in nearby groups may be kin (Bradley et al., Current Biology 2004) and that males
within mountain gorilla groups are not necessarily closely related (Bradley et al PNAS 2005:
Vigilant et al., PNAS 2012).
9. line 338. Other studies investigate relatedness of multiple groups of social animals, not clear
what is meant here by ‘unique’.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This manuscript provides very interesting data on the paternity distribution and the kin structure
of wild living bonobos. By analyzing 17 paternities in 2 neighboring bonobo groups, the
presented data support the recently published evidence of an unexpectedly strong male
reproductive skew in this species. Furthermore, the authors analyze average relatedness between
mature individuals of different sex-categories between 3 different groups. The presented genetic
data support the expectations based on the behaviorally inferred pattern of male-philopatry in
this species.
In order to make their results interesting to a general audience, the authors have to setup their
study better in a broader theoretical framework. It remains unclear why bonobos are interesting
and what the specific findings contribute to the theory of reproductive competition and/or kin
selection theory. A clearer formulation of the main hypothesis would be helpful too. Generally, I
think a problem is that the manuscript addresses two rather independent questions, namely the
one about reproductive skew among males and the second one about genetic differentiation
4
between groups. It might be easier to setup the studies in two independent manuscripts to be
able to focus the introduction and the discussion better.
Specific comments:
L37: “affiliative interaction among different group females predicted on kin selection theory”.
This is a very broad statement and I am not sure whether the presented average relatedness and a
general higher tendency of affiliation between females of different groups really give us insights
into kin selection or whether an analysis of behavior and genetics on a dyadic levels would be
better to address such a link. Please see specific comment for L237ff for an additional comment
about kin selection in this context.
L 46: Social systems can also be connected e.g. by mating interests
L48: citation 2 and 3 are very specific. It would be good to have broader review papers
L50 “reproductive consequences”, do you mean reproductive skew?
L53/54 might not true: please see for bonobos and chimpanzees: Schubert et al 2011: “Male-
Mediated Gene Flow in Patrilocal Primates”, Langergraber et al 2011: “Genetic differentiation
and the evolution of cooperation in chimpanzees and humans”. These papers might be helpful as
well in setting up the introduction.
L70 The results of these two studies might not be consistent because they differ in the rigor of the
methodology. The Surbeck et al 2017 paper calculates skew mainly for conceptions with
undebated paternities and during time periods where dominance ranks as well as presence of
males is known, which is not the case in the Gerloff et al 1999 paper.
L77 is this the right citation? Shouldn’t it be the Tokuyama paper 2017 about female leadership?
L84 see Schubert et al 2011
L109 define “mature”. Does it include adult and adolescent males?
L232 Closer inspection of the data in the time period for which information of dominance
relationships between males and all the present males at conception is available, actually shows
that the skew is even stronger ( E1: 6 out of 7 [86%] and PE: 3 out of 4 [75%]). Please try to gie a
range
L237ff Does the average relatedness across groups differ between males and females? Only if
females are closer related, we would expect that inclusive fitness explains the patterns of female
affiliation across groups.
L250 maximum individual paternity success is in a general literature often referred to as most
successful sire’s share
L 259 or methodological problems such as incomplete sampling or problems with assigning
offspring.
L 263 was Ki also a high ranking individual in another group?
L279 this is only a suspected case of extra group paternity, as a clear identification of the sire is
lacking. The approach of only excluding present males have been shown to be erroneous in the
past (e.g. Gagneux et al 2001, Constable 2001).
L295 discuss Schubert et al 2011
L297 may consider Hohmann 2001 for indications of male transfer
L313 but see Bradley et al 2004: “Dispersed male networks in western gorillas”. While I think it is
a very interesting part in the discussion, it should be done more carefully.
L324 see Moscovice et al 2017 for the finding of 2 adult female dyads in the same community that
are likely mother-daughters. Consequently female might also remain in the community to
reproduce.
L331 I slightly disagree. If kin selection would be responsible for the affiliative behavior, we
would see it to the same degree among males, as average relatedness between groups is
comparable to the one of females. Please consider such an argument as well.

Comments to the Author(s)

I review this paper for the second time and it has substantially improved to the first version.
While I think that the introduction still needs some more information on the general background
of the relationships between the measured parameters (male philopatry, aggressive mate
competition, skew, genetic differentiations.. see comments below), I have one big issue left in the
revisions (something I might overlooked in the first version) and that is the comparison of
reproductive skews across species. It is very important if comparing reproductive skew between
species to use the same time window for all species (normally the skew on short term is way
larger than over longer time periods: see Lukas and CluttonBrock 2014). This is because skew not
only changes over time but also potentially during a given alpha tenure. This insight might be
important to incorporate in the comparisons with the results of other studies and in Figure 2
(where the colours are badly chosen, so it is hardly possible to attribute the species name to a
given dot especially the other bonobo community seems to be hidden somewhere). Finally, the
manuscript would at some parts benefit in terms of clarity from a proper English editing.
Minor comments:
L 26 how does less severe male-male competition suggest that reproductive skew is higher? The
rational behind this statement is not clear.
L56 It is not clear how data from male philopatric species can lead to a better understanding of
male male-male competition. For a broad readership, it is necessary to state explicitly what we
learn about male mate competition by studying a male philopatric species or why would you
expect something to be different in male competition in such a species at the first place.
L67 Surbeck et al 2012 specifically focuses on male mate competition, so you should cite this
paper here
L74 Please specify the link between intensity of male competition and reproductive skew for a
broad readership
L79 Do you also refer to within-group competition? It would be good to give some examples on
how kinship within groups affect competition, but you do not talk about that, right? It is just
confusing as you talk until here in the introduction only about within-group competition. You
need to introduce between-group competition better, so the second part of your study makes
sense….maybe use the arguments about aggressiveness and differentiation from L88 to introduce
the topic.

reproductive skews across species. It is very important if comparing reproductive skew between
species to use the same time window for all species (normally the skew on short term is way
larger than over longer time periods: see Lukas and CluttonBrock 2014). This is because skew not
only changes over time but also potentially during a given alpha tenure. This insight might be
important to incorporate in the comparisons with the results of other studies and in Figure 2
(where the colours are badly chosen, so it is hardly possible to attribute the species name to a
given dot especially the other bonobo community seems to be hidden somewhere). Finally, the
manuscript would at some parts benefit in terms of clarity from a proper English editing.
Minor comments:
L 26 how does less severe male-male competition suggest that reproductive skew is higher? The
rational behind this statement is not clear.
L56 It is not clear how data from male philopatric species can lead to a better understanding of
male male-male competition. For a broad readership, it is necessary to state explicitly what we
learn about male mate competition by studying a male philopatric species or why would you
expect something to be different in male competition in such a species at the first place.
L67 Surbeck et al 2012 specifically focuses on male mate competition, so you should cite this
paper here
L74 Please specify the link between intensity of male competition and reproductive skew for a
broad readership
L79 Do you also refer to within-group competition? It would be good to give some examples on
how kinship within groups affect competition, but you do not talk about that, right? It is just
confusing as you talk until here in the introduction only about within-group competition. You
need to introduce between-group competition better, so the second part of your study makes
sense….maybe use the arguments about aggressiveness and differentiation from L88 to introduce
the topic.

Response to referees
Dear Dr. Kevin Padian,
We would like to thank you and the reviewers for reviewing our manuscript
ntitled “Paternity and kin structure among three neighbouring groups in wild
bonobos at Wamba” and giving us valuable suggestions.
Following you and the two reviewers’ suggestions, we have revised our
manuscript to mainly focus on male–male reproductive competition in male-
philopatric species. For a better understanding of the subject, we have
xplained that comparisons between bonobos and chimpanzees are effective
because although these two species are the most closely related species with
ach other, and share many traits in terms of social systems, including male-
philopatry, the intensity of male–male competition is remarkably different
between these two species. We have explained that comparing the
eproductive skew between these two species could elucidate the relationships
between the intensity of male–male reproductive competition and the degree
f reproductive skew in male-philopatric species. We also have explained that
omparing the between-group differentiation in male kinship between these
wo species is necessary to clarify the difference in antagonism towards males
f different groups between the two species.
We have responded to the comments made by the referees in more detail in
bold and italic as below. We think that the revision has complemented the
nsufficiencies in our previous manuscript. We hope that our revised
manuscript will be suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Yours sincerely,
Shintaro Ishizuka (Corresponding author)

Comments to the Author(s) Review RSOS 171006
The manuscript by Ishizuka and colleagues reports on some finding from
esearch on bonobos at one of the very few field sites studying this important
great ape. It is thus important data, especially as it encompasses information
n two groups.
This paper addresses two questions: 1) male reproductive skew in wild
bonobos and 2) average relatedness of males and females within and across
groups.
The Introduction is very limited, focuses almost entirely upon bonobos, and
lthough the authors state that it is necessary to ‘reveal patterns of kinships
nd reproductive consequences to understand the social system of a target
pecies’ they do not spell out why this is interesting or necessary. In addition,
he two questions addressed in this paper are not convincingly linked to one
nother, and the authors should explain to the reader in more detail how sex-
biased dispersal patterns are expected to affect same sex affiliative patterns,
nd how this may be reflected in average relatedness levels, with citations of
iterature beyond bonobos. Then it is necessary to link the dispersal patterns to
male reproductive competition and the potential role of the mothers in
nfluencing their sons’ reproductive success in this male philopatric society.
The last sentence of the Abstract should be removed as it is confusing- it
eems to suggest there is an analysis of dyadic female interactions and the
ole of kinship.
> We thank the referee for reviewing our manuscript and pointing out
he insufficiencies, particularly in the introduction. Thank you for your
uggestions, we were able to understand how the introduction of our
manuscript was limited. In our revised manuscript, we have mainly
ocused on male–male reproductive competition in male-philopatric
pecies. For a better understanding of the subject, we have explained
hat comparing the reproductive skew between bonobos and
himpanzees is interesting because both species share many traits in
erms of social systems, including male-philopatry, but the intensity of
heir inter-male aggression is completely different. Additionaly, to
larify the differences in antagonism towards males of different groups
between the two species, we have explained that a greater
understanding of the between-group differentiation in male kinship is
necessary. We have explained that both questions need to be
nvestigated to understand the differences in intensity of male-male
eproductive competition between the two species. Furthermore, in
he discussion, to discuss the higher reproductive skew in bonobos
han in chimpanzees, we have proposed the potential role of the
mothers in influencing their sons’ reproductive success. Because we
have rearranged our manuscript to mainly focus on male–male
eproductive competition, we have removed the sections mentioning
he relationships between affinitive interactions of females and their
kinship.
Additional comments
1. lines 67-70: it is an exaggeration to say that the results from Lomako and
uiKotale are ‘not consistent’, which maybe makes it sound like error is
nvolved, when these numbers are expected to vary due to many potential
actors including number of competing males, stability of social group, number
f simultaneously estrous females, the time span of the study etc.
> Following your suggestion, we have rearranged this part. In the
evised introduction, we have explained the necessity to obtain more
data on the reproductive skew among bonobo males to add to the two
previous studies.
Line 68;
A recent study from LuiKotale reported that the reproductive skew is higher in
onobo males than in chimpanzee males [9].”
2. I see that there were some 77 individuals in the three groups in 2014. I am
urprised that only 86 + 7 samples were used in this study. This means that
nearly all individuals were only represented by data from a single sample. How
did the authors confirm the identity of the samples?
> We and our local assistants have identified all individuals well. When
we collected their DNA samples, we observed their defaecation
behaviours. Therefore, we collected samples of all adult and
adolescent individuals, and samples of different individuals showed
different genotypes. In addition, we could not observe the allele
mismatching between parent-offspring dyads confirmed by long-term
observation. Based on this, we are confident that all of the samples
were used with correct identities.
3. line 185 so the allele frequencies were estimated using data from all
ndividuals, correct?
> To calculate the allele frequency, we used data from adult and
adolescent males and immigrant parous females, because genotypes
of the offspring would increase the frequency of alleles of the most
uccessful siring males.
4. Table 1: this is at which point in time?
> To make it cleared that the information in Table 1 is at the time
when the kin structure was investigated, we have rearranged the table
heading as below:
Table 1: Composition of each group when the kin structure was investigated”
5. Reporting the skew index for group E1 would allow for direct comparison
with the recent work by Surbeck et al.
> Following your suggestions, we calculated the Nonac’s B index (the
ame reproductive skew index) in E1 group and compared it with the
data from Surbeck et al. (2017). We have added the following parts to
he revised manuscript:
Line 206;
Based on the results of paternity of offspring in E1 group, we calculated the Nonac’s
B index of reproductive skew [35].”
Line 232;
The Nonac’s B index of reproductive skew in E1 group was 0.51.”
Line 275;
The percentage of the most successful sire’s share in the two groups, as well as the
Nonac’s B index in E1 group were higher than those recorded in the Bompusa
ommunity at LuiKotale (Most successful sire’s share: 62%, Nonac’s B index: 0.22 [9]).”
6. line 237 section Pairwise relatedness Please clarify that the comparisons
nvolve adults and adolescents only.
> As per your suggestion, we have revised as below:
Line 257;
Pairwise relatedness value of adult and adolescent males and immigrant parous
emales”
7. Figure 2 would be more effective if the identity of the other primates was
pecified in the legend.
> As per your suggestion, we have specified the identity of the other
primates in Figure 2.
8. .lines 313-314 with regard to the question of whether males within or across
great ape groups are more closely related, there are other papers that show
using genetic evidence that western gorilla males in nearby groups may be kin
Bradley et al., Current Biology 2004) and that males within mountain gorilla
groups are not necessarily closely related (Bradley et al PNAS 2005: Vigilant et
l., PNAS 2012).
> Thank you for sharing the list of important papers in this field and
helping us to make our discussion more comprehensive. Following
your suggestion, we have revised this part as below:
Line 339;
Higher average relatedness among males within groups was also observed in a
revious study on chimpanzees [18]. In Tai forest, average relatedness among males
within chimpanzee groups tends to be higher than that among males across groups.
Although the available data are still limited, these suggest that between-group
ifferentiation in male kinship is similar in bonobos and chimpanzees. Therefore, it
might be impossible to explain differences in hostility towards males of different
roups between bonobos and chimpanzees based purely on kinship. On the other hand,
study on western gorillas reported that males of neighboring groups have kinships
with each other, whereas another study reported that the single males leading groups
were usually related to one or more nearby males [53,54]. Most western gorilla males
migrate while they are blackbacks or young silverbacks [55]. The between-group
ifferentiation in male kinship in both bonobos and chimpanzees could be attributed
o male philopatry, which is one of stable traits in the genus Pan.”
9. line 338. Other studies investigate relatedness of multiple groups of social
nimals, not clear what is meant here by ‘unique’.
> Following your suggestion, we have removed the word ‘unique’ used
n this context.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s) This manuscript provides very interesting data on
he paternity distribution and the kin structure of wild living bonobos. By
nalyzing 17 paternities in 2 neighboring bonobo groups, the presented data
upport the recently published evidence of an unexpectedly strong male
eproductive skew in this species. Furthermore, the authors analyze average
elatedness between mature individuals of different sex-categories between 3
different groups. The presented genetic data support the expectations based
n the behaviorally inferred pattern of male-philopatry in this species. In order
o make their results interesting to a general audience, the authors have to
etup their study better in a broader theoretical framework. It remains unclear
why bonobos are interesting and what the specific findings contribute to the
heory of reproductive competition and/or kin selection theory. A clearer
ormulation of the main hypothesis would be helpful too. Generally, I think a
problem is that the manuscript addresses two rather independent questions,
namely the one about reproductive skew among males and the second one
bout genetic differentiation between groups. It might be easier to setup the
tudies in two independent manuscripts to be able to focus the introduction
nd the discussion better.
> We thank the referee for reviewing our manuscript and giving us
valuable suggestions to create a broader theoretical framework. In the
evised manuscript, we have mainly focused on male–male
eproductive competition in male-philopatric species, and explained
hat comparing the reproductive skew between bonobos and
himpanzees is interesting because both species share many traits in
erms of social systems, including male philopatry but the intensity of
nter-male aggressions is completely different between these two
pecies. Our study contributes to the theory of reproductive
ompetition in that we showed the inconsistency between the intensity
of male–male reproductive competition and highly skewed
eproductive success in male-philopatric species. Our findings on
between-group differentiation in male kinship is also valuable because
he hostility towards males of different groups can not be explained by
male kinship in male-philopatric species. Although we agree that it is
possible to divide the studies into two independent manuscripts, we
hink that our two questions are linked to each other and both
questions should be investigated to elucidate the male–male
eproductive competition in male philopatric species.
Specific comments:
37: “affiliative interaction among different group females predicted on kin
election theory”. This is a very broad statement and I am not sure whether
he presented average relatedness and a general higher tendency of affiliation
between females of different groups really give us insights into kin selection or
whether an analysis of behavior and genetics on a dyadic levels would be
better to address such a link. Please see specific comment for L237ff for an
dditional comment about kin selection in this context.
> We agreed that dyadic-level genetics would be required to explain
he affiliation between females of different groups by kinship. We have
evised the introduction and focused mainly on male-male
eproductive competition in male-philopatric species. In the revised
manuscript, we have not mentioned the kin selection theory in detail,
and excluded the explanation about the possible relationships between
affiliative interactions among females of different groups and kin
election.
46: Social systems can also be connected e.g. by mating interests
> We agreed with your suggestion. To avoid confusion, we have
excluded the statement regarding this subject.
48: citation 2 and 3 are very specific. It would be good to have broader
eview papers
> As per your suggestion, we have cited the broader review paper
Clutton-Brock, (2002) at Line 79.
50 “reproductive consequences”, do you mean reproductive skew?
> Yes, we meant “reproductive skew”. Because the original term is
unclear, we have only used the term “reproductive skew” in the
evised manuscript.
53/54 might not true: please see for bonobos and chimpanzees: Schubert et
l 2011: “Male-Mediated Gene Flow in Patrilocal Primates”, Langergraber et al
2011: “Genetic differentiation and the evolution of cooperation in chimpanzees
nd humans”. These papers might be helpful as well in setting up the
ntroduction.
> Thank you for sharing the list of important papers in this field and
helping us to set up our introduction better. We have read and cited
hese papers in the manuscript. We have revised the part below to
explain why genetic differentiation between bonobo groups needs to
be investigated.
Line 85;
To clarify these differences, a previous study estimated that male-mediated gene flow
was more frequent in bonobos than in chimpanzees [17]. This suggests that differences
n aggression might be because between-group differentiation in male kinship is
igher in chimpanzees than in bonobos. However, although there have been a few
tudies on genetic differentiation between chimpanzee groups, there have been limited
tudies on genetic differentiation between bonobo groups [17–19]. Comparison of
etween-group differentiation in male kinship may explain the differences in hostility
owards males of different groups between these two species. Thus, further
nvestigation on kinship both within and across bonobo groups is necessary to
lucidate this.”
70 The results of these two studies might not be consistent because they
differ in the rigor of the methodology. The Surbeck et al 2017 paper calculates
kew mainly for conceptions with undebated paternities and during time
periods where dominance ranks as well as presence of males is known, which
s not the case in the Gerloff et al 1999 paper.
> We apologise for misunderstanding the difference between the
methodology of the two studies. We have understood and excluded the
direct comparison. In the revised introduction, we have explained the
necessity to add more data on the reproductive skew among bonobo
males to the previous two studies, as below:
Line 68;
A recent study from LuiKotale reported that the reproductive skew is higher in
onobo males than in chimpanzee males [9]. However, there have been a large number
f studies on the reproductive skew in chimpanzees compared to only two studies on
he reproductive skew in bonobos [9,10]. It could be expected that comparing the
eproductive skew between these two species could elucidate the relationships
etween the intensity of male–male reproductive competition and the degree of
eproductive skew in male-philopatric species. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain
more data on the reproductive skew among bonobo males.”
77 is this the right citation? Shouldn’t it be the Tokuyama paper 2017 about
emale leadership?
> We apologise for citing an inappropriate paper. We have revised the
manuscript to change the main focus to male–male reproductive
ompetition, and have not explained the possible relationships
between affiliative interactions among females of different groups and
kin selection.
84 see Schubert et al 2011
> Thank you for indicating our misunderstanding. Previous studies
have showed that genetic differentiation between bonobo groups has
been investigated and that the rate of male-mediated gene flow has
been estimated. In this context, we have explained the necessity to
add studies on between-group differentiation in male kinship in
bonobos. We have revised this part as below:
Line 85;
To clarify these differences, a previous study estimated that male-mediated gene flow

etween-group differentiation in male kinship may explain the differences in hostility

nvestigation on kinship both within and across bonobo groups is necessary to
lucidate this.”
109 define “mature”. Does it include adult and adolescent males?
> Yes, but to avoid the confusion, we have revised this term to “adult
and adolescent males and females which have been estimated as
mmigrant and parous.”
232 Closer inspection of the data in the time period for which information of
dominance relationships between males and all the present males at
onception is available, actually shows that the skew is even stronger ( E1: 6
ut of 7 [86%] and PE: 3 out of 4 [75%]). Please try to gie a range
>Following your suggestions, we have revised this part as below:
Line 270;
9 out of 11 offspring in the two study groups were sired by the alpha males and the
ercentage of the most successful sire’s share was in total 81.8%, in the time period for
which information on dominance relationships between males and all the present
males at conception is available (E1: 86%, PE: 75%). The percentage of the most
uccessful sire’s share in the present study was higher than that in other multi-
male/multi-female group-living primates (Figure 2) [9,10,38–46]. The percentage of
he most successful sire’s share in the two groups, as well as the Nonac’s B index in E1
roup were higher than those recorded in the Bompusa community at LuiKotale (Most
uccessful sire’s share: 62%, Nonac’s B index: 0.22 [9]).”
237ff Does the average relatedness across groups differ between males and
emales? Only if females are closer related, we would expect that inclusive
itness explains the patterns of female affiliation across groups.
> Average relatedness among females across groups was significantly
higher than that among males across groups. However, as previously
tated, we mainly focus on the male–male reproductive competition in
he revised manuscript. Therefore, we have excluded the explanation
of the relationships between the patterns of female affiliation across
groups and the kin selection theory.
250 maximum individual paternity success is in a general literature often
eferred to as most successful sire’s share

iterature, we have changed “maximum individual paternity success”
o “most successful sire’s share” in all instances.
259 or methodological problems such as incomplete sampling or problems
with assigning offspring.
> Thank you for indicating our misunderstandings. Following your
uggestion, we believe that data from Surbeck et al. (2017) are more
appropriate for direct comparison with our data. Therefore, in the
evised manuscript, we have discussed the similarities and differences
between our data and data from Surbeck et al. (2017).
263 was Ki also a high ranking individual in another group?
> We understand that your question is whether Ki was a high ranking
ndividual in multiple groups during group encounters. According to
our general observations, we think that Ki is also a high ranking
ndividual in another group. And Furuichi, (2011) indicates the
possibility of this occurrence, with the following statement: “In the
2008 study period, we found that KIKU, who had been the second-
anking female, was the alpha female, though we do not know when
he rank reversal occurred.”
279 this is only a suspected case of extra group paternity, as a clear
dentification of the sire is lacking. The approach of only excluding present
males have been shown to be erroneous in the past (e.g. Gagneux et al 2001,
Constable 2001).
> Thank you for indicating our misunderstanding. We have revised this
part as below:
Line 303;
A previous study reported that some of male-mediated gene flow might be produced
y extra-group paternities [17]. This suggests that it is probable that some offspring in
ach group might be sired by extra-group males.”
295 discuss Schubert et al 2011
297 may consider Hohmann 2001 for indications of male transfer
> To answer both the above suggestions, we have revised our
manuscript as below:
Line 319;
Although male gene flow between groups could occur because of some rare reasons
uch as extra-group paternities, immigration of females with dependent male
ffspring, or even adolescent or adult male dispersal, these factors might not be
ufficient to eliminate the differentiation in average relatedness of males between
roups [17,50].”
313 but see Bradley et al 2004: “Dispersed male networks in western
gorillas”. While I think it is a very interesting part in the discussion, it should
be done more carefully.
> Thank you for your suggestions. Following them, we have revised
his part carefully, citing more papers as below:
Line 339;
Higher average relatedness among males within groups was also observed in a
revious study on chimpanzees [18]. In Tai forest, average relatedness among males
within chimpanzee groups tends to be higher than that among males across groups.
Although the available data are still limited, these suggest that between-group
ifferentiation in male kinship is similar in bonobos and chimpanzees. Therefore, it
might be impossible to explain differences in hostility towards males of different
roups between bonobos and chimpanzees based purely on kinship. On the other hand,
study on western gorillas reported that males of neighboring groups have kinships
with each other, whereas another study reported that the single males leading groups
were usually related to one or more nearby males [53,54]. Most western gorilla males
migrate while they are blackbacks or young silverbacks [55]. The between-group
ifferentiation in male kinship in both bonobos and chimpanzees could be attributed
o male philopatry, which is one of stable traits in the genus Pan.”
324 see Moscovice et al 2017 for the finding of 2 adult female dyads in the
ame community that are likely mother-daughters. Consequently female might
lso remain in the community to reproduce.
> As per your suggestion, we have mentioned the possibility that
emales might remain in their natal communities. We have added the
tatement as below:
Line 357;
Although a recent study reported that there were two confirmed mother-daughter
yads within the group, the effects of this on the kin structure might be limited to
ncreasing the average relatedness among females within groups [56].”
331 I slightly disagree. If kin selection would be responsible for the affiliative
behavior, we would see it to the same degree among males, as average
elatedness between groups is comparable to the one of females. Please
onsider such an argument as well.
> We agree with your suggestion. As we previously stated in response
o your suggestions, we have focused mainly on male–male
eproductive competition in the revised manuscript. Therefore,
although we include a discussion of the kin structure of females among
hree neighbouring groups, we decided against connecting that data
with the theory of kin selection.

Response to referees
Dear Dr. Kevin Padian,
We are pleasured to hear that our manuscript entitled “Paternity and kin
structure among three neighbouring groups in wild bonobos at Wamba” has
been accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science subject to
minor revisions. We would like to thank you and the reviewers for reviewing
our manuscript and giving valuable comments.
Following you and the referee suggestions, we have revised our
manuscript. At the beginning of the introduction, we have explained the
general tendency of the male reproductive skew in more detail to
incorporate the comparisons with other studies in the discussion part. We
also have explained more clearly about male–male reproductive competition
in male-philopatric species, and the possible effect on male–male
competition by kinship. In addition, we have rearranged the Figure 2 to
make it more kind for readers.
We have responded to the comments made by the referees in more detail
in bold and italic as below. We think that the revised version of our
manuscript has complemented the insufficiencies in our previous one. Once
again, we would like to thank your effort to review our manuscript and
decision that our manuscript has been accepted for publication in Royal
Society Open Science.
Yours sincerely,
Shintaro Ishizuka (Corresponding author)

Comments to the Author(s)
I review this paper for the second time and it has substantially improved to
the first version. While I think that the introduction still needs some more
information on the general background of the relationships between the
measured parameters (male philopatry, aggressive mate competition, skew,
genetic differentiations.. see comments below), I have one big issue left in
the revisions (something I might overlooked in the first version) and that is
the comparison of reproductive skews across species. It is very important if
comparing reproductive skew between species to use the same time window
for all species (normally the skew on short term is way larger than over
longer time periods: see Lukas and CluttonBrock 2014). This is because
skew not only changes over time but also potentially during a given alpha
tenure. This insight might be important to incorporate in the comparisons
with the results of other studies and in Figure 2 (where the colours are
badly chosen, so it is hardly possible to attribute the species name to a
given dot especially the other bonobo community seems to be hidden
somewhere). Finally, the manuscript would at some parts benefit in terms
of clarity from a proper English editing.
> We thank the referee for reviewing our manuscript repeatedly
and pointing out the remained insufficiencies in our manuscript.
Following your comments, we have explained the general tendency
of the male reproductive skew in more detail in the beginning of the
introduction. We believe that it leads to comparisons with other
studies in the discussion part. In addition, we have explained more
clearly about male–male reproductive competition in male-
philopatric species, and the possible effect on male–male
competition by kinship. We also have rearranged the Figure 2 to
make it more kind for readers, and have corrected the sentences
written with inappropriate English.
Minor comments:
L 26 how does less severe male-male competition suggest that reproductive
skew is higher? The rational behind this statement is not clear.
> Following your suggestions, we have revised this part as below:
Line 22;
“Although both bonobos and chimpanzees are male-philopatric species, outcomes of
male–male reproductive competitions seem be more closely associated with mating
success in chimpanzees. This suggests that the extent of male reproductive skew is
lower in bonobos. In addition, between-group male–male reproductive competition
is more lethal in chimpanzees.”
L56 It is not clear how data from male philopatric species can lead to a
better understanding of male male-male competition. For a broad
readership, it is necessary to state explicitly what we learn about male mate
competition by studying a male philopatric species or why would you expect
something to be different in male competition in such a species at the first
place.
> Following your suggestions, we have explained how male–male
reproductive competition can be predicted to be different between
female-philopatric species and male-philopatric species. We have
revised this part as below:
Line 56;
“In male-philopatric species, it is predicted that some males within groups are
related by kinship. Therefore, males of male-philopatric species may be able to gain
the inclusive fitness via the reproductive success of other males related to them [6].
This suggests that the mechanism of male–male reproductive competition may
differ between male-philopatric species and female-philopatric species. For a more
complete understanding of male–male reproductive competition in group-living
animals, male-philopatric species should be investigated to clarify the mechanism
of reproductive competition among males which are potentially related by kinship.”
L67 Surbeck et al 2012 specifically focuses on male mate competition, so
you should cite this paper here
> Following your suggestions, we have cited the papers on male–
male competition (Surbeck et al. 2012; Muller& Wrangham, 2004)
L74 Please specify the link between intensity of male competition and
reproductive skew for a broad readership
> Following your suggestions, we have revised this part as below:
Line 73;
“One potential factor to explain the less intensive reproductive competition among
bonobo males is the extended periods of female sexual receptivity and
attractiveness [13]. This would modulate the intensity of male–male competition
for mating opportunities, and would increase the potential for female choice [14]. It
follows, then, that the extent of reproductive skew among bonobo males is
predicted to be lower than that among chimpanzee males.”
L79 Do you also refer to within-group competition? It would be good to give
some examples on how kinship within groups affect competition, but you do
not talk about that, right? It is just confusing as you talk until here in the
introduction only about within-group competition. You need to introduce
between-group competition better, so the second part of your study makes
sense….maybe use the arguments about aggressiveness and differentiation
from L88 to introduce the topic.
> Following your suggestions, we have reconstructed the flow to
introduce the male–male reproductive competition between groups
by referring the competition within groups. We have revised this part
as below:
Line 90;
“Although some males within groups could be related by kinship in male-philopatric
species, some previous studies reported that the patterns of alliance formation or
cooperative interactions among males were not explained by kinship (chimpanzees
[19], bottlenose dolphins [20]). However, between-group reproductive competition
potentially can be explained by kinship. Although both bonobos and chimpanzees
are male-philopatric species and it is predicted that males are more closely related
within groups than between groups, the antagonism towards males of different
groups is completely different between these two species. For example, chimpanzee
males sometimes make lethal coalitionary attacks and kill males of different groups,
whereas bonobo males do not make such attacks [21–24]. This difference may be
explained by the fact that between-group differentiation in male kinship is greater
in chimpanzees than in bonobos.”
