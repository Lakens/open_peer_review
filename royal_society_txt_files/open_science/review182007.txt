Very interesting work, dealing with the chain shuttling polymerization reaction for the
copolymerization of ethylene/1-octene in the presence of the various catalyst. The work can be
suggested for publication since no serious scientific issues were found and also the method
advances the synthesis of such type of copolymers.
A few remarks:
- I am a little bit astonished why the authors proof the synthesis of block copolymers by rheology
and not by NMR. Was it not possible due to the solubility of the synthesized copolymers? Please
state such a comment. A hind is that maybe it could be possible to perform HR-MAS experiments
if the copolymers can be swollen in a deuterated solvent.
- Was it possible to regain catalysts after the synthesis? This would be extremely interesting since
reusing of the catalyst for similar synthesis can save a lot on resources.
- I can understand that higher molecular weight is kind of important but since the dispersity
index is high, can it be considered that the properties (e.g., the mechanical properties) of the
synthesized polymers are homogeneous?
- Was it possible to perform somehow mechanical tests on the synthesized samples? A DMTA
experiment would be interesting in order to approximately estimate the young modulus of the
copolymers.
- Please check for language and typo error. In some parts, the language is not nice and there are
also mistakes and mix up such us "block polymers" or expressions like "In order to investigate
whether the catalytic system (A/B/MAO/ZnEt2) could prepare block copolymers with
branching structure by chain shuttling polymerization. It was investigated that the amount of
ZnEt2 affected on molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, ..."

This research studies the chain shuttling polymeriztion reaction of bisphenoxy-imine zr binary
catalyst systems and used a few characterization methods to study the material structures and
properties.
1. the introduction was not comprehensively reviewing the state of the art;
2. for the DSC tests, did the test get rid of the thermal history of the materials?
3. for figure 3 &4, what do the cross points of logG' and logG'' mean?

Appendix A
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’comments concerning our
manuscript entitled “Studies on chain shuttling polymerization reaction of
nonbridged half-titanocene and bis(phenoxy-imine) Zr binary catalyst system”
(ID: RSOS-182007). Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for
revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding significance
to our researches. We have studied comments carefully and have made correction
which we hope meet with approval. Revised portion are marked in purple in the
paper. The main corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s
comments are as flowing:
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer: 1
1. Why the authors proof the synthesis of block copolymers by rheology
and not by NMR<U+FF1F>
Response: On one hand, the carbon nuclear magnetic characterization only
could obtain the average number of branches and the distribution of branches on
the polymer chain. This characterization results couldn’t directly prove existence
of block copolymers. On the other hand, the block structure could significantly
affect the mechanical properties of the blends. Therefore, we chose rheology
rather than NMR to prove the synthesis of block copolymers.
2. Was it possible to perform HR-MAS experiment?
Response: Because the copolymers dissolved in deuterated trichlorobenzene
rather than swelling, it couldn’t perform HR-MAS experiments.
3. Was it possible to regain catalysts after the synthesis?
Response: Because the olefin chain shuttling polymerization experiments
was performed in solution, it was possible to regain catalysts in theory. Since the
catalyst was easily inactivated, it would lead to expensive regaining cost of the
catalysts. Therefore, we generally didn’t choose to recycle this type of catalysts.
4. Can it be considered that the properties (e.g., the mechanical properties)
of the synthesized polymers are homogeneous?
Response: Since the catalytic system produced polymer mixtures containing
block copolymers, whereas the block copolymers had a compatibilization effect
on the mixtures. Therefore, the properties of the polymers with high
polydispersity were still homogeneous.
5. Was it possible to perform somehow mechanical tests on the synthesized
samples, such as DMTA experiment?
Response: We believed that the DMTA test could provide valuable young's
modulus information. However, the amount of some experimental samples was
quite low. It was difficult to make standard testing samples according to DMTA
test requirements. Therefore, we only regretted to say that DMTA
characterization couldn’t be performed for some significant experimental
samples.
making it impossible to prepare test strips in accordance with DMTA test
requirements.
6. Please check for language and typo error.
Response: The detailed modify of language and typo error see purple text in
new version manuscript.
Reviewer: 2
1. The introduction was not comprehensively reviewing the state of the art.
Response: In the course of this research, we have reviewed a quite
literatures. Although only the most related literature was added into introduction,
the introduction has fully covered all the literatures, especially for the latest
reports, on chain shuttling polymerization research.
2. For the DSC tests, did the test get rid of the thermal history of the
materials?
Response: When performing the DSC test, the sample was heated to 160 °
C at a rate of 10<U+2103> min-1 and keep it for 1 minute. The operation process could
completely eliminate the thermal history of the samples.
3. For figure 3 &4, what do the cross points of logG' and logG'' mean?
Response: The cross point of log G' and log G'' is the flow point. In the low
angular frequency range, the storage modulus of the polymers is lower than the
loss modulus, indicating that the polymers viscosity is dominant on the range. As
the angular frequency increases, the storage modulus of the polymers increases
rapidly, indicating the polymers elasticity increasing.
We tried our best to improve the manuscript and made large language
changes in the manuscript. These changes will not influence the content and
framework of the paper. And here we did not list the changes but marked in
purple in revised paper.
We appreciate for Editors/Reviewers’ warm work earnestly, and hope that
the correction will meet with approval.
Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.
