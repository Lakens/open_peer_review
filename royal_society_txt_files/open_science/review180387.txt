Author have done broader perspective on two-, one- and zero-dimensional (2D, 1D, and 0D)
inorganic nanomaterials which represent a bridge between the selectivity of molecular catalysts
and the high performance and stability of inorganic catalysts. As a consequence of the low
dimensions, higher surface areas are obtained but also introduced new physics and increased
tunability of the electronic states in the nanostructured system. Further, author have re-derive the
commonly used equations for optical transitions and carrier confinement in semiconductors and

bandgap materials. In particular, the physical properties of the optical and photocatalytic
properties of Fe2O3 and ZnO will be used to examplify the effects of the low dimensionality.
Carrier confinement effects with changes in the density of states, banddgap/shift of band edges
will be outlined together with their effects on the tuneability of the material and their wider
application as photocatalytic materials

Dear Editor
Thank you for the response and the constructive comments from you and the
reviewers to more clearly present the work. Please find attached a resubmission of
the manuscript which we have revised to meet the minor concerns raised + some
additional improvements not considered by the reviewers that we think increase the
clarity of the contribution.
For your convenience, we write our point-by-point response in blue in the supplied
letter so that it can be more clearly separated from the comments by the reviewers.
We also supply a revised manuscript with markup of changes in red color and one
without mark up.
We look forward to hear from you regarding the suitability of our manuscript for
publication after our revision,
Yours sincerely,
Tomas Edvinsson

Comments on “Optical Quantum Confinement and Photocatalytic
Properties in Two-, One-, and Zero-Dimensional Nanostructures”:
The paper intended to publish in Royal Society Open Science re-
derive the commonly used equations for optical transitions and
carrier confinement in semiconductors and discuss their effect
on the optical and photocatalytic properties of direct band and
indirect band gap materials, the paper could be possible
publish after a major revision, the reviewer has some comments
as follows:
1. The authors should review the latest research progress
on this specific topic.
2. The author assume that the wave functions for the
electrons and holes can be separated as <U+F059>=<U+F046>(re)<U+F046>(rh) and that
the correlation between the electron and hole is small, please
explain it in detail.
3. Please discuss the Quantum Confinement and
Photocatalysis in 1D materials system.
1. Thank you for the suggestion. As the contribution is not a review, and instead an
article with derivation and discussion of the commonly used equations and the
connection and use of optical quantum confinement in a photocatalytic process,
with reference to original work earlier in science, we refrain expanding it to a review
on the more general subject. This would also be a quite different contribution,
strongly enhanced in size and scope.
2. It follows from the separation of the wave function into two separate
contributions in the product (no mixed term included). We have now clarified this by
changing the sentence at page 5, after equation 22 from “and that the correlation
between the electron and hole is small” to “and thus that the correlation between
the electron and hole is small”. Further details can be found in Ref 1 as referred to in
context to equation 22.
3. The equation for the 1D density of state is in the running text after Eq 16 and
included as third image in Fig 1. The effective density of states for the 1D case is Eq.
20 and can for a slit-off heavy-hole/light-hole band be analogously formed from Eq
21, considering the different density of state difference between Eq 18 and 20. The
1D case for dispersion (and DOS) is also in Table 1.
For the use of 1D optical quantum confinement in practical photocatalysis, there are
very few relevant works to refer to. This is because of the difficulty in producing
optically quantum confined wires, where e.g. ZnO as smallest, are reported as 10 nm
diameters (not optically quantum confined).
The literature is full of article titles about 1D materials, but then in a context of
general dimension, not 1D confinement enough for affecting the optical band gap
which is the focus of this contribution. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can partly be
considered 1D but are intrinsically rolled up 2D where the bandgap can be
determined by the extension of the native 2D sheet, neglecting the strain in the 2D
sheet from the curvature when rolled up into a tube, but is outside the scope of this
paper (see e.g. our contribution in PCCP,2017, 19, 30667).
To meet the reviewer also with respect to the more practical side of the 1D situation
(1D is already included in the main theoretical framework) and to clarify this to the
reader, we have included a section of the 1D situation in the Final remarks, together
with 6 new references.
“For the use of 1D materials (2D confined) with respect to optical quantum
confinement, there are very few examples in the literature, due to the challenge in
producing these small dimensions in inorganic wires. The field of photocatalysis have
a plethora of studies that refer to 1D dimensionality but then in context to the
general dimension of a rod or wire, but not generally with sufficiently small
dimensions to have 1D optically quantum confined materials.49-52 For organic matter,
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can partly be considered 1D but are intrinsically rolled up
2D materials where the bandgap can be determined by the extension of the native
2D sheet, neglecting the strain in the 2D sheet from the curvature when rolled up
into a tube.53,54 In this context, carbyne (linear acetylenic carbon) is an intrinsic 1D
system but show small possibility of band gap control relevant for photocatalysis
where instead bending is a more promising route towards optical change.55

We have read the three papers and do not find that they are relevant for the
manuscript. The first paper (Appl Phys A, 95, 2009, 613) is about enhanced field
emission from monocrystalline ZnO on Re and W, and do not contain quantum
confined ZnO or photocatalysis. Second paper (RCS Advances 5, 2015, 88796) is
about V2O5 nano sheets for humidity sensors, photodetectors, and enhanced field
emission properties, again not quantum confined and no photocatalysis. Third paper
is on antimicrobial activity of ZnO nanoparticles against pathogenic bacteria and
fungi. Although we appreciate the time and effort in reading the manuscript, there
were no comments or assessment on the content of the manuscript and we cannot
find relevance for the three suggested papers. We have instead added 7 new
references in context to the comments on the 1D dimensionality from reviewer 2.
We have also added a small section in context to the discussion after equation 25,
that more clearly specify the current reaching the surface (Jsurf) for the reader. A
new equation (Eq 26), a short illumination of the assumptions behind this and a
reference to the person deriving it originally is added (ref 33, W. Gärtner, Phys Rev,
1959, 116, 84-87). We have also improved and clarified the manuscript with some
minor changes in some few other places that can be followed in the version with
track changes.
