The authors apply the chromatic number to the investigation of the growth and development of
the mental lexicon of English toddlers. The chromatic number is relative to the well studied
problem of graph colouring, which has been linked to other instances of problems such as SAT
problems and which are massively investigated in Statistical Physics and Computer Science.
The application of the chromatic number to word learning is therefore an interesting, elegant and
clever point of novelty for detecting meso-scale changes in the structure of the mental lexicon of
toddlers. The authors took a great deal of effort in explaining the details behind the chromatic
number also to an audience outside of the physics realm, which is the right direction for such an
interdisciplinary investigation in Complexity Science.
Although the paper is nicely structured, there are some points that should be addressed by the
authors before publication. In particular, my main concern is about individual variability making
it quite difficult to make general statements about sudden transitions in network structure during
early word learning. This crucial point should be better discussed by the authors. I believe they
should underline that the syntactic spurt they detect in two children has been intensively studied
by previous studies and that the current technique is capable of highlighting this pattern in those
specific children. I would like for the authors to discuss some more of the representativeness of
the data analysed in the current manuscript, especially considered that previous network
approaches have analysed datasets of longitudinal data accounting for individual variability.
Also, in order to improve the readability of the manuscript by also language scientists from the
cognitive sciences, I suggested a few references about past approaches to modelling word
learning as structural transition in networks of lexical items. I would recommend for the authors
to integrate these references in the manuscript in order to improve the interpretation and stress
by comparison novelty of their interesting results.
The references I pointed out all agree on indicating that network modelling of early word
learning is quickly becoming a “hot” topic in the community of complex systems, hence the scope
and timing of the manuscript would be ideal for an interdisciplinary journal venue like Royal
Society Open Science.
I hope my comments provide useful feedback from the perspective of the cognitive sciences. I
would be more than happy to review again this interesting manuscript.

1) Page 1, Column 1, Line 51 – The authors talk about language evolution and then structure a
brief literature review of models about it. However the main scope of the paper is language
acquisition. Language evolution is a different process compared to language acquisition,
happening at different time scales and at different levels of a given population of language
speakers. I would recommend for the authors to explicitly underline that language learning is a
different process compared to language acquisition and re-focus a bit the literature review over
word learning rather than on language evolution.
2) I would suggest briefly mentioning two works.
3
One is by cognitive scientists and uses co-occurrence networks, which partially overlap with
syntactic networks, for investigating word learning in typical and late talkers:
Beckage, N., Smith, L., & Hills, T. (2011). Small worlds and semantic network growth in typical
and late talkers. PloS one,6(5), e19348.
The main result of the paper is that late talkers display different co-occurrence network features
compared to normative learners. Hence, syntactic networks can capture real-world patterns of
language learning.
Another suggestion fitting the scope of the paper would be an approach by statistical physicists
and cognitive scientists in tracking network structural changes in a multiplex network of
semantic, taxonomic and phonological word-features:
Stella, M., Beckage, N. M., Brede, M., & De Domenico, M. (2018). Multiplex model of mental
lexicon reveals explosive learning in humans. Scientific reports, 8(1), 2259.
The main result of the paper is that the mental lexicon of normative talkers displays an explosive
phase transition around age 7 yrs, a well documented age of increased cognitive and linguistic
development. This is another work showing that linguistic transitions can indeed be captured by
complex networks.
Enriching the introduction with a brief mention of other relevant network approaches would
increase the novelty of the approach provided by the authors of this manuscript, by
contrast/comparison.
3) Page 4, Column 2, Line 37 – “First tree networks…” -> “The first tree networks…”
4) Page 4, Column 2, Last Paragraph – Please explain what “functional particles” are for the non-
experts by providing some examples. Also, what do the authors mean by high “grammar
flexibility”? This part of the results is particularly relevant for the paper and should be described
in more detail, with some examples.
5) Page 5, Column 2, Line 49 – The measure of relevance \chi was called relative energy
previously. Repeating its name here would improve the clarity of this sentence.
6) Page 5, Column 2, Last Paragraph – What do the authors mean by “clear trend towards
increasing maximum clique and maximum K-core with increased relevance”? How is relevance
defined? This is an important statement for justifying how the chromatic number can be a valid
proxy of “global” network features. Please reword this passage for increased clarity. The
rewording has to be careful with using “global”, since even showing the presence of larger K-
cores does not really imply a global structural pattern.
I imagine a simple counter-example in which a fictional network densifies its core by only adding
more links, so that its maximum K-core becomes larger and K increases. However, at the same
time, the network could leave its periphery completely untouched. In that case, the sign of an
increasing K would not be a global estimator of structural changes in the network but rather a
sign of increasing connectivity at the meso-scale level of the network core. If this was the case also
in the growing syntactic network, would it be better to say that the chromatic number is an
estimator of meso-scale or non-local, rather than global, network organization? The authors leave
this open to speculation later on line 7 of Page 6, where they say that rather than the whole
network it might be just a part of it leading to the emergence of a non-trivial K-core structure.
7) Page 6, Column 1, Line 1 – What do the authors mean by saying that the relevance of the
chromatic number as a global complexity estimator is much more “feasible”? Also the term
“global complexity” can be ambiguous in this context, as it might refer to specific complexity
measures from the cognitive sciences rather than to addressing the structural organization of a
complex network. Please reword this passage for increased clarity.

8) Page 7, Figure 4. The authors claim in the text that Figure 4 shows a well-defined non-trivial
deviation between real networks and random networks. However, provided the small number of
samples, it is really difficult to see this in Figure 4, between top and bottom panels. I would
suggest presenting at least correlation measures or other quantitative estimates for the
correlations. Also, for visual inspection it would help to produce all the panels on the same
ranges and improve the size of the points. Currently, it feels difficult for the reader to reconcile
the text with the figure. This point is particularly important for the very interesting results
reported in the text.
9) Page 7, Column 2, Line 41 – The authors talk about combining aspects of syntax, phonology
and semantics. It would be of relevance to briefly discuss again two approaches, one from the
cognitive sciences and one from physicists/computer scientists.
From the cognitive sciences, it could be of relevance the approach by Dautriche and colleagues.
They modelled French word acquisition in toddlers of 18 months. Dautriche and colleagues
reported evidence that contrary to previous conjectures, early word learning is not dominated by
simple phonological similarities but rather by a complex multidimensional combination of
phonological, syntactical and semantic similarities among words. Dautriche and colleagues
reported that for nouns, these multi-dimensional similarities inhibited the acquisition of new
nouns while network similarities facilitated acquisition of new verbs. These
facilitatory/inhibitory effects might be causing the increased structural complexity captured by
the authors through the chromatic number. The reference is:
Dautriche, I., Swingley, D., & Christophe, A. (2015). Learning novel phonological neighbors:
Syntactic category matters.Cognition, 143, 77-86.
From physicists, it could be of relevance the approach by Stella and colleagues, who used
networks of co-occurrences, free associations, feature sharing and phonological similarities for
predicting early word learning on the same dataset used by the authors. Although Stella and
colleagues did not use syntactic links but rather co-occurrences as a proxy for syntactic
relationships, they also showed that: (i) month 23, close to the spurt investigated by the authors,
is an important “critical” phase where children start using mainly free association for word
learning; (ii) syntactic relationships are important throughout early development for predicting
word learning, but only when the global structure of the mental lexicon is considered, in
agreement with the message behind the chromatic number about the global structure of the
mental lexicon being relevant to word acquisition. The reference is:
Stella, M., Beckage, N. M., & Brede, M. (2017). Multiplex lexical networks reveal patterns in early
word acquisition in children.Scientific Reports, 7, 46730.
10) Page 8, Column 1, Line 15 – Rather than “linguistic performance” it would be more
appropriate to say “linguistic proficiency”.
11) Page 8, Column 1, Line 19 – The authors indicate the chromatic number as being evidently
better in underlining the presence of the syntactic spurt. However, it should be underlined that
the comparison has been performed only on two children. Such a small size constitutes a problem
in making general statements and should be carefully addressed by the authors. Longitudinal
studies over the same CHILDES dataset used by the authors have been testing many more
children. For instance, Beckage et al. (2011) investigated word learning in 66 children. Why was
the current analysis limited to only 2 children? Where there data limitations? The main issue here
is that individual variability plays a huge role in semantic networks this small, like reported also
by Beckage et al. (2011), so that more extensive longitudinal studies are usually necessary. Maybe
this point can be addressed by providing some more details about Carl and Peter. Are they
typical talkers? How are these two children representative of the population of normative early
5
talkers?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This work reports on a graph theoretic approach to syntax development in young children. The
work uses the notion of chromatic number, the minimum number of colors required to properly
paint a graph, to investigate the development of syntactic complexity.
I found this idea interesting and I appreciated the comparison with the null model/simulation as
revealing of 'order' in syntactic development that was not previously visible.
Overall, I'm of two minds. On one side, as a new measure of graph complexity, I find chromatic
number to be interesting and potentially meaningful in relation to syntax. Thus if the paper is
about chromatic number and an example case, I think it succeeds (assuming it hasn't all been
done before). If, on the other hand, the work is meant to teach us about syntax in a way that will
be meaningful to developmental psychologists and linguists, then I think it fails. To succeed in
these domains it would need to situate itself in a larger literature and explain how the new
finding sits in that literature. It does not attempt to do in its present formulation beyond noting
some prominent figures in the grammar/language literature. I'm somewhat indifferent and leave
this to the editor to make the call. If this were reviewed only by statistical physicists, I suppose it
would be fine. Indeed, if that is the framing, it is probably ready for publication pretty much as is.
If it were sent out only to psychologists/linguists, I suspect few would make it past equation 2
and would find the results uninteresting. This latter group can be reached to a degree with some
minor additions, unpacking the results with respect to the existing literature and offering some
pointers, as I suggest below. I think that's worth doing in either case.
Specific comments:
1. More needs to be said about the null model. It seems to me there are multiple way to go about
this and the method that is taken is left somewhat opaque, unless perhaps one reads citation [7],
6
which I didn't. For example, one could connect the words that children say by their relationships
in syntactic trees. If words are nodes, which seems n obvious assumption, then figure 3 doesn't
amke sense, because the number of nodes is different between the simulation and the observed
data. So words aren't nodes. But since it says they are in several places throughout the paper, I'm
completely lost. One could redistribute edges with or without syntactic classes, or assume some
syntactic classes but not others, etc, and compare different null models. This isn't done. Perhaps
that way that is done is the only meaningful way to do it, but it isn't explained why this would be
true. So more needs to be said here. I'm generally in favor of competing models against one
another, as it's all too easy to come up with a null model that generates data different from the
observed data, but a more interesting question (to me) is what assumptions are needed to get to
the observed data. That would tell us a lot.
2. I don't understand figure 4 and it seems the description definitely has at least one typo. Also,
why not plot the observed and simulated together, to clearly show the differences, as in figure 3?
3. If the authors want to reach the developmentalists, they'll need to say more about what exactly
chromatic number is telling us in real syntax. What's the intuition? I understand the Potts model
intuition and I recognize that it measures structural information about a graph, but I don't see
what it tells us about syntax. I suppose that will be for future researchers to figure out, but a
comparison of more than one null model as suggested above would at least point us in a
direction.
4. Little is said about previous graphical approaches to syntax, though there are quite a few
running back some 30 or more years. The dominant citations are about language and syntax
generally. Probabilistic (network) approaches to grammar have been found wanting in many
cases (Pinker, Smolensky). I think it's important to discuss how the present approach (especially
the method of network construction) is like or not like these previous approaches (see some more
recent work by Kolodny et al.). I think the present work is probably most closely associated with
probabilistic work like Kolodny's.

better in underlining the presence of the syntactic spurt. However, it should be underlined that
the comparison has been performed only on two children. Such a small size constitutes a problem
in making general statements and should be carefully addressed by the authors. Longitudinal
studies over the same CHILDES dataset used by the authors have been testing many more
children. For instance, Beckage et al. (2011) investigated word learning in 66 children. Why was
the current analysis limited to only 2 children? Where there data limitations? The main issue here
is that individual variability plays a huge role in semantic networks this small, like reported also
by Beckage et al. (2011), so that more extensive longitudinal studies are usually necessary. Maybe
this point can be addressed by providing some more details about Carl and Peter. Are they
typical talkers? How are these two children representative of the population of normative early
talkers?

Comments to the Author(s)
This work reports on a graph theoretic approach to syntax development in young children. The
work uses the notion of chromatic number, the minimum number of colors required to properly
paint a graph, to investigate the development of syntactic complexity.
I found this idea interesting and I appreciated the comparison with the null model/simulation as
revealing of 'order' in syntactic development that was not previously visible.
Overall, I'm of two minds. On one side, as a new measure of graph complexity, I find chromatic
number to be interesting and potentially meaningful in relation to syntax. Thus if the paper is
about chromatic number and an example case, I think it succeeds (assuming it hasn't all been
done before). If, on the other hand, the work is meant to teach us about syntax in a way that will
be meaningful to developmental psychologists and linguists, then I think it fails. To succeed in
these domains it would need to situate itself in a larger literature and explain how the new
finding sits in that literature. It does not attempt to do in its present formulation beyond noting
some prominent figures in the grammar/language literature. I'm somewhat indifferent and leave
this to the editor to make the call. If this were reviewed only by statistical physicists, I suppose it
would be fine. Indeed, if that is the framing, it is probably ready for publication pretty much as is.
If it were sent out only to psychologists/linguists, I suspect few would make it past equation 2
and would find the results uninteresting. This latter group can be reached to a degree with some
minor additions, unpacking the results with respect to the existing literature and offering some
pointers, as I suggest below. I think that's worth doing in either case.
Specific comments:
1. More needs to be said about the null model. It seems to me there are multiple way to go about
this and the method that is taken is left somewhat opaque, unless perhaps one reads citation [7],
which I didn't. For example, one could connect the words that children say by their relationships
in syntactic trees. If words are nodes, which seems n obvious assumption, then figure 3 doesn't
amke sense, because the number of nodes is different between the simulation and the observed
13
data. So words aren't nodes. But since it says they are in several places throughout the paper, I'm
completely lost. One could redistribute edges with or without syntactic classes, or assume some
syntactic classes but not others, etc, and compare different null models. This isn't done. Perhaps
that way that is done is the only meaningful way to do it, but it isn't explained why this would be
true. So more needs to be said here. I'm generally in favor of competing models against one
another, as it's all too easy to come up with a null model that generates data different from the
observed data, but a more interesting question (to me) is what assumptions are needed to get to
the observed data. That would tell us a lot.
2. I don't understand figure 4 and it seems the description definitely has at least one typo. Also,
why not plot the observed and simulated together, to clearly show the differences, as in figure 3?
3. If the authors want to reach the developmentalists, they'll need to say more about what exactly
chromatic number is telling us in real syntax. What's the intuition? I understand the Potts model
intuition and I recognize that it measures structural information about a graph, but I don't see
what it tells us about syntax. I suppose that will be for future researchers to figure out, but a
comparison of more than one null model as suggested above would at least point us in a
direction.
4. Little is said about previous graphical approaches to syntax, though there are quite a few
running back some 30 or more years. The dominant citations are about language and syntax
generally. Probabilistic (network) approaches to grammar have been found wanting in many
cases (Pinker, Smolensky). I think it's important to discuss how the present approach (especially
the method of network construction) is like or not like these previous approaches (see some more
recent work by Kolodny et al.). I think the present work is probably most closely associated with
probabilistic work like Kolodny's.

Reviewer comments to Author:
1) Page 1, Column 1, Line 51 – The authors talk about language evolution and
hen structure a brief literature review of models about it. However the main
scope of the paper is language acquisition. Language evolution is a different
process compared to language acquisition, happening at different time scales and
at different levels of a given population of language speakers. I would
ecommend for the authors to explicitly underline that language learning is a
different process compared to language acquisition and re-focus a bit the
iterature review over word learning rather than on language evolution.
2) I would suggest briefly mentioning two works.
One is by cognitive scientists and uses co-occurrence networks, which partially
overlap with syntactic networks, for investigating word learning in typical and
ate talkers:
Beckage, N., Smith, L., & Hills, T. (2011). Small worlds and semantic network
growth in typical and late talkers. PloS one,6(5), e19348.
The main result of the paper is that late talkers display different co-occurrence
network features compared to normative learners. Hence, syntactic networks can
capture real-world patterns of language learning.
Another suggestion fitting the scope of the paper would be an approach by
statistical physicists and cognitive scientists in tracking network structural
changes in a multiplex network of semantic, taxonomic and phonological word-
eatures:
Stella, M., Beckage, N. M., Brede, M., & De Domenico, M. (2018). Multiplex model
of mental lexicon reveals explosive learning in humans. Scientific reports, 8(1),
2259.
The main result of the paper is that the mental lexicon of normative talkers
displays an explosive phase transition around age 7 yrs, a well documented age
of increased cognitive and linguistic development. This is another work showing
hat linguistic transitions can indeed be captured by complex networks.
Enriching the introduction with a brief mention of other relevant network
approaches would increase the novelty of the approach provided by the authors
of this manuscript, by contrast/comparison.
Thank you for the citations and the comments 1) and 2). We added the citations
and a brief comment in the discussion.
3) Page 4, Column 2, Line 37 – “First tree networks…” -> “The first tree
networks…”
Thanks. We corrected the typo.
4) Page 4, Column 2, Last Paragraph – Please explain what “functional particles”
are for the non-experts by providing some examples. Also, what do the authors
mean by high “grammar flexibility”? This part of the results is particularly
elevant for the paper and should be described in more detail, with some
examples.
We added a clear definition of functional particle and provided some examples.
5) Page 5, Column 2, Line 49 – The measure of relevance \chi was called relative
energy previously. Repeating its name here would improve the clarity of this
sentence.
There is a confusion here, since we refer to the chromatic number itself. We
clarified the issue and we hope that now everything is clearer.
6) Page 5, Column 2, Last Paragraph – What do the authors mean by “clear trend
owards increasing maximum clique and maximum K-core with increased
elevance”? How is relevance defined? This is an important statement for
ustifying how the chromatic number can be a valid proxy of “global” network
eatures. Please reword this passage for increased clarity. The rewording has to
be careful with using “global”, since even showing the presence of larger K-cores
does not really imply a global structural pattern.
imagine a simple counter-example in which a fictional network densifies its core
by only adding more links, so that its maximum K-core becomes larger and K
ncreases. However, at the same time, the network could leave its periphery
completely untouched. In that case, the sign of an increasing K would not be a
global estimator of structural changes in the network but rather a sign of
ncreasing connectivity at the meso-scale level of the network core. If this was
he case also in the growing syntactic network, would it be better to say that the
chromatic number is an estimator of meso-scale or non-local, rather than global,
network organization? The authors leave this open to speculation later on line 7
of Page 6, where they say that rather than the whole network it might be just a
part of it leading to the emergence of a non-trivial K-core structure.
Thank you again. We reworded the whole paragraph, hoping that now everything
s more understandable. We agree that it is a crucial paragraph for the paper.
7) Page 6, Column 1, Line 1 – What do the authors mean by saying that the
elevance of the chromatic number as a global complexity estimator is much
more “feasible”? Also the term “global complexity” can be ambiguous in this
context, as it might refer to specific complexity measures from the cognitive
sciences rather than to addressing the structural organization of a complex
network. Please reword this passage for increased clarity.
Again, this is solved by the complete rewritting of the paragraph mentioned
above.
8) Page 7, Figure 4. The authors claim in the text that Figure 4 shows a well-
defined non-trivial deviation between real networks and random networks.
However, provided the small number of samples, it is really difficult to see this in
Figure 4, between top and bottom panels. I would suggest presenting at least
correlation measures or other quantitative estimates for the correlations. Also,
or visual inspection it would help to produce all the panels on the same ranges
and improve the size of the points. Currently, it feels difficult for the reader to
econcile the text with the figure. This point is particularly important for the very
nteresting results reported in the text.
We changed the figure according to these criticisms --also raised by other
eviewers. We hope that now the information is clearly conveyed to the reader.
9) Page 7, Column 2, Line 41 – The authors talk about combining aspects of
syntax, phonology and semantics. It would be of relevance to briefly discuss
again two approaches, one from the cognitive sciences and one from physicists/
computer scientists.
From the cognitive sciences, it could be of relevance the approach by Dautriche
and colleagues. They modelled French word acquisition in toddlers of 18 months.
Dautriche and colleagues reported evidence that contrary to previous
conjectures, early word learning is not dominated by simple phonological
similarities but rather by a complex multidimensional combination of
phonological, syntactical and semantic similarities among words. Dautriche and
colleagues reported that for nouns, these multi-dimensional similarities inhibited
he acquisition of new nouns while network similarities facilitated acquisition of
new verbs. These facilitatory/inhibitory effects might be causing the increased
structural complexity captured by the authors through the chromatic number.
The reference is:
Dautriche, I., Swingley, D., & Christophe, A. (2015). Learning novel phonological
neighbors: Syntactic category matters.Cognition, 143, 77-86.
From physicists, it could be of relevance the approach by Stella and colleagues,
who used networks of co-occurrences, free associations, feature sharing and
phonological similarities for predicting early word learning on the same dataset
used by the authors. Although Stella and colleagues did not use syntactic links
but rather co-occurrences as a proxy for syntactic relationships, they also
showed that: (i) month 23, close to the spurt investigated by the authors, is an
mportant “critical” phase where children start using mainly free association for
word learning; (ii) syntactic relationships are important throughout early
development for predicting word learning, but only when the global structure of
he mental lexicon is considered, in agreement with the message behind the
chromatic number about the global structure of the mental lexicon being relevant
o word acquisition. The reference is:
Stella, M., Beckage, N. M., & Brede, M. (2017). Multiplex lexical networks reveal
patterns in early word acquisition in children.Scientific Reports, 7, 46730.
Thank you very much, for it helps to frame the discussion much better. We
added these references and we briefly commented them.
10) Page 8, Column 1, Line 15 – Rather than “linguistic performance” it would be
more appropriate to say “linguistic proficiency”.
We performed this change.
11) Page 8, Column 1, Line 19 – The authors indicate the chromatic number as
being evidently better in underlining the presence of the syntactic spurt.
However, it should be underlined that the comparison has been performed only
on two children. Such a small size constitutes a problem in making general
statements and should be carefully addressed by the authors. Longitudinal
studies over the same CHILDES dataset used by the authors have been testing
many more children. For instance, Beckage et al. (2011) investigated word
earning in 66 children. Why was the current analysis limited to only 2 children?
Where there data limitations? The main issue here is that individual variability
plays a huge role in semantic networks this small, like reported also by Beckage
et al. (2011), so that more extensive longitudinal studies are usually necessary.
Maybe this point can be addressed by providing some more details about Carl
and Peter. Are they typical talkers? How are these two children representative of
he population of normative early talkers?
We added a justification of our choice. We also highlighted the weak points that
our choice may carry on, contrasting them against the strong ones.
We thank again Dr. Massimo Stella for his constructive and enriching comments.

atter group can be reached to a degree with some minor additions, unpacking

1. More needs to be said about the null model. It seems to me there are multiple

unless perhaps one reads citation [7], which I didn't. For example, one could
connect the words that children say by their relationships in syntactic trees. If

nteresting question (to me) is what assumptions are needed to get to the
observed data. That would tell us a lot.
Thanks for raising this point. We added a new paragraph justifying the choice of
he null model. It would seem natural to go for a standard graph randomization
echinque, however, the graph here is a surrogate of a deeper phenomena. Our
choice has been, therefore, to create a corpus of a speaker who, sharing the
statistics of sentence length and number of utterances, lacks any syntactic
structure and, then, build the network upon this ‘random corpus’. Under our
viewpoint, this null model, even more elaborated than others, grasps the essence
of the problem we are dealing with. We hope that the wider justification we
provide in the revised version can clarify the doubts raised before.
2. I don't understand figure 4 and it seems the description definitely has at least
one typo. Also, why not plot the observed and simulated together, to clearly show
he differences, as in figure 3?
We changed the figure such that now everything is easier to understand.

Thanks for raising this point, which helps us to reach a wider audience. We added
a paragraph in the introduction motivating the use of the chromatic number as a
suitable measure for syntax development.
