Review of “Life History Theory and Climate Change: Resolving Population and Parental
Investment Paradoxes”
In this paper, the authors analyze individual and country-level data to determine whether ‘future
orientation’ (FO) influences CO2 emissions and fertility in humans. The data indicate that FO is
related to fertility and CO2, but that it interacts with other variables, such as education level and
mortality risk. The authors suggest that FO at higher levels of education can reduce the carbon
cost of adopting a K-strategy, and as such, is an intervention point that can help influence CO2
emissions.
I think it’s an interesting approach, linking psychology to life histories and trying to connect this
all to climate change. As such it could be of interest to a wide range of people, scientists and non-
scientists alike.
That said, I do have some concerns:
I’m not an expert on FO, but it strikes me as a bit of an outcome rather than a driver.
Development usually proceeds as technological investments increase, lowering mortality and
then birth rates, and it strikes me that you get higher FO along the way. It currently reads as if
high-income countries are that way because of FO. Some clarifications on this would be very
helpful – do you see FO as an outcome, something merely correlated with development, or as a
driver of development?
It’s not clear to me what counts as an independent data point in this analysis. It says on line 94
that you are dealing with ~67,000 females from 75 countries, along with national level
information. Table 1 suggests you treat all 67,000 females as independent, even though you are
including life expectancy at birth (LEB). LEB is an expected value estimated for a whole cohort –
it cannot be measured on an infant – so there cannot be 67,000 independent estimates of LEB. So
shouldn’t this go into the country-level analysis? If FO and TFR are measured on individuals,
then it seems you could keep individual the replicate for that, but the countries then should be
random effects, because variation in these things is also clearly occurring across countries.
Another area that needs a bit of thought is whether humans in wealthy countries are really K-
strategists. While they may look that way, this strategy is often thought of as something that
arises under a more stable population size (that is, something close to carrying capacity, K). But
the human population is nowhere close to stabilizing, despite suggestions by the UN’s forecasts.
Not only that, the UN medium projection does not even represent a carrying capacity at all. It is
an unstable equilibrium that is highly dependent on high levels of energy use (and attendant CO2
emissions) (DeLong et al. 2010, 2013). So it might be worth recognizing these issues, because K
strategies develop under resource competition, which wealthy countries aren't really facing yet.
It might also be worth mentioning the role of energy use in setting life histories for modern
humans. As a proxy for development, and a fundamental currency in life history evolution
3
(Charnov 1993), energy use is strongly tied to a diverse array of life history traits in modern
humans (Burger et al. 2011), including TFR, mortality rate, and a variety of physiological
processes like age at menarche and menopause. Again, since FO seems like an outcome, you
might discuss how it is related to energy use, or provides additional insights, that energy use
does not provide. This might be additional motivation for your intervention idea, because as it
stands, population stabilization can only be achieved through massive increases in energy use,
with the attendant increases in CO2 emissions.
Finally, fertility appears to be rising in some wealthy countries, providing a serious conflict for
current thinking on life histories of modern humans, the demographic transition, and
sustainability (Myrskyla et al. 2009, Burger and DeLong 2016). Thus, while overall FO might be
related to TFR broadly speaking, it’s link may be compromised in the near future, potentially
undermining your argument that FO can attenuate CO2 emissions. It would be good to address
this possibility.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In this paper the authors apply life history theory to explain variation in carbon emissions across
the globe, including reconciling contradictory effects of changing population size and resource-
use. While I applaud the objective of demonstrating the utility of evolutionary approaches to an
urgent and seemingly intractable global challenge, I wasn’t entirely clear what the authors
wanted me to think/ conclude by the end. Is LHT theory actually useful for explaining carbon
emissions? I think their conclusion is as follows: r and K strategies lead to high and low TFR
respectively, and both predict unsustainable resource-use (carbon emissions), but only super K
strategists (high education) attenuate this effect. Some clarity at the end of the paper on how LHT
adds something to what is known about the behaviour at the upper end of the PI spectrum would
be useful.
It also may be interesting for the author’s to note that high fertility norms are now being seen
among the wealthiest in high-income norms, who can afford both large families and high
investment. Wealth also buffers from extrinsic mortality risk. I’d be interested to see how 'income
levels' influences their models, particularly if the authors want to demonstrate that
education/knowledge can play the most critical role in shaping behavioural change. Wealth and
education tend to be very closely associated.
The authors are rightly cautious by referring to their findings as associations, but the language in
the introduction particularly seems to indicate they are in a position to test causality. I would
rephrase line 15, as they don’t actually perform the kind of mediational analyses which would be
needed to demonstrate that ‘FO slows population growth’.
Small typos/comments:
Line 35 – the use of predation as an example of an extrinsic mortality risk, isn’t really relevant for
humans today. Could the authors provide a more contemporary risk factor ?

Review of “Life History Theory and Climate Change: Resolving Population and
Parental Investment Paradoxes”
In this paper, the authors analyze individual and country-level data to determine
whether ‘future orientation’ (FO) influences CO2 emissions and fertility in humans.
The data indicate that FO is related to fertility and CO2, but that it interacts with
other variables, such as education level and mortality risk. The authors suggest that
FO at higher levels of education can reduce the carbon cost of adopting a K-strategy,
and as such, is an intervention point that can help influence CO2 emissions.
I think it’s an interesting approach, linking psychology to life histories and trying to
connect this all to climate change. As such it could be of interest to a wide range of
people, scientists and non-scientists alike.
That said, I do have some concerns:
I’m not an expert on FO, but it strikes me as a bit of an outcome rather than a driver.
Development usually proceeds as technological investments increase, lowering
mortality and then birth rates, and it strikes me that you get higher FO along the way.
It currently reads as if high-income countries are that way because of FO. Some
clarifications on this would be very helpful – do you see FO as an outcome,
something merely correlated with development, or as a driver of development?
- We agree that more clarity should have been provided on the interrelation
between FO, development, and lowered mortality. We tried to be cautious
about presenting FO as a driver of development given we believe it
should arise alongside decreases in extrinsic risk and in feedback with
development (e.g., education). We do try to examine whether FO, once
promoted by lower risk environments, could be “co-opted” in the context
of higher education to promote carbon friendly behaviors. In this sense,
we would argue that FO could play a role in driving “carbon-friendly”
behavior. To make our position clearer, we have provided an extended
discussion in the “Life History Theory: Resolving Population and
Parental Investment Paradox?” section.
It’s not clear to me what counts as an independent data point in this analysis. It says
on line 94 that you are dealing with ~67,000 females from 75 countries, along with
national level information. Table 1 suggests you treat all 67,000 females as
independent, even though you are including life expectancy at birth (LEB). LEB is
an expected value estimated for a whole cohort – it cannot be measured on an infant
– so there cannot be 67,000 independent estimates of LEB. So shouldn’t this go into
the country-level analysis? If FO and TFR are measured on individuals, then it seems
you could keep individual the replicate for that, but the countries then should be
random effects, because variation in these things is also clearly occurring across
countries.
- LEB is an attribute of the country but we treat it as an individual attribute
because we use the individual’s age to compute the value (i.e., the average
LEB from when they were born to when they reached the age of 10). Of
course, this means LEB is the same for same-aged people within a country.
By calculating LEB in this manner, however, it is not a property of the
country (although it is not truly an independent property of the individual
either). To ensure that readers understand the level at which LEB was entered
into the model, we include more discussion in the Methods section (Lines
123-124). FO was quantified at the country-level and thus could not be
entered in the lower order equation.
Another area that needs a bit of thought is whether humans in wealthy countries are
really K-strategists. While they may look that way, this strategy is often thought of as
something that arises under a more stable population size (that is, something close to
carrying capacity, K). But the human population is nowhere close to stabilizing,
despite suggestions by the UN’s forecasts. Not only that, the UN medium projection
does not even represent a carrying capacity at all. It is an unstable equilibrium that is
highly dependent on high levels of energy use (and attendant CO2 emissions)
(DeLong et al. 2010, 2013). So it might be worth recognizing these issues, because K
strategies develop under resource competition, which wealthy countries aren't really
facing yet.
- We use a broad definition of r and K strategies that includes, but is not
limited to, original definitions based upon density-dependence (e.g.,
MacArthur and Wilson). We attempt to make our use clearer in LINES 12-19
and 40-46
It might also be worth mentioning the role of energy use in setting life histories for
modern humans. As a proxy for development, and a fundamental currency in life
history evolution (Charnov 1993), energy use is strongly tied to a diverse array of
life history traits in modern humans (Burger et al. 2011), including TFR, mortality
rate, and a variety of physiological processes like age at menarche and menopause.
Again, since FO seems like an outcome, you might discuss how it is related to
energy use, or provides additional insights, that energy use does not provide. This
might be additional motivation for your intervention idea, because as it stands,
population stabilization can only be achieved through massive increases in energy
use, with the attendant increases in CO2 emissions.
- We attempt to make the argument that future orientation is related to energy
use by promoting a more long-term/environmental orientation, particularly in
the context of higher education. Thus, we see orientation as an aspect of
psychology related to energy use. We have made this point more explicit in
the Lines 99-103
Finally, fertility appears to be rising in some wealthy countries, providing a serious
conflict for current thinking on life histories of modern humans, the demographic
transition, and sustainability (Myrskyla et al. 2009, Burger and DeLong 2016). Thus,
while overall FO might be related to TFR broadly speaking, it’s link may be
compromised in the near future, potentially undermining your argument that FO can
attenuate CO2 emissions. It would be good to address this possibility.
We agree our discussion of human life history should have included the
positive relationship between high levels of development and fertility rates.
We highlight these findings in Lines 53-56, and in concert with our own
findings, suggest the need for more research into orientation in high
development contexts Lines 207-210.
Little things
Title – I don’t really get why there is a paradox.
- We use the term paradox to generally refer to contradictory statements. An
increase is fertility is associated with increased emissions while a decrease in
fertility is also associated with increased emissions. Investments to promote
“dynastic fitness” by lower carrying capacity will ultimately lower dynastic
fitness.
Line 25 – Incomplete sentence
- Fixed
Line 32 – What does it mean to “collide”?
- This sentence has been removed. It foreshadows our arguments but does
not provide enough detail to understand those arguments.
Line 64 – How does industrialization increase this pressure?
- We have correct this sentence to reflect that developments associated with
industrialization (education) are themselves associated within higher
levels of parental investment.

In this paper the authors apply life history theory to explain variation in carbon
emissions across the globe, including reconciling contradictory effects of changing
population size and resource-use. While I applaud the objective of demonstrating the
utility of evolutionary approaches to an urgent and seemingly intractable global
challenge, I wasn’t entirely clear what the authors wanted me to think/ conclude by
the end. Is LHT theory actually useful for explaining carbon emissions? I think their
conclusion is as follows: r and K strategies lead to high and low TFR respectively,
and both predict unsustainable resource-use (carbon emissions), but only super K
strategists (high education) attenuate this effect. Some clarity at the end of the paper
on how LHT adds something to what is known about the behaviour at the upper end
of the PI spectrum would be useful.
- We agree that we should have revisited the usefulness of LHT in
understanding climate change. We have expanded the Conclusion section
to more explicitly highlight how are findings developed from an LHT
approach. Lines 200-204
It also may be interesting for the author’s to note that high fertility norms are now
being seen among the wealthiest in high-income norms, who can afford both large
families and high investment. Wealth also buffers from extrinsic mortality risk. I’d
be interested to see how 'income levels' influences their models, particularly if the
authors want to demonstrate that education/knowledge can play the most critical role
in shaping behavioural change. Wealth and education tend to be very closely
associated.
- We agree that there should have been more discussion of the trend toward
higher fertility at high development levels. We have included an
expanded discussion of this trend in our review of LHT (Lines 53-56). In
regards to wealth, we did include a proxy of wealth in earlier models,
although at the country-level (gross national income per capita). This
country-level variable did not have a significant impact on the
relationship between risk (LEB) and TFR. We include this finding in the
new supplement. We suspect we may have found an association if we had
used individual level data on income. Unfortunately, the databases we
combined in our analysis did not have comparable data on individual
income (coded as high, medium, low versus dollars, etc.). We have added
a sentence in the final Discussion paragraph (Lines 196-197) to highlight
the importance of included wealth and other covariates of education in
future models.
The authors are rightly cautious by referring to their findings as associations, but the
language in the introduction particularly seems to indicate they are in a position to
test causality. I would rephrase line 15, as they don’t actually perform the kind of
mediational analyses which would be needed to demonstrate that ‘FO slows
population growth’.
- We agree some sentences (especially on line 15) read as if we view our
analysis as indicating causation. We have removed all wording that
suggests our analysis provides a causal test of FO on life-history
dynamics.
Small typos/comments:
Line 35 – the use of predation as an example of an extrinsic mortality risk, isn’t
really relevant for humans today. Could the authors provide a more contemporary
risk factor ?
- We agree and have changed predation to “civil war” and “extreme
weather events”
Line 129 – remove ‘increased’
- Removed
Line 163 – sp. Unstainable
- Spelling changed
