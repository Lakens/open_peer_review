Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
This paper compares stepping stone algorithms to DIC for model selection and claims that the
stepping stone algorithms are superior. The main form of comparison is to compare runtimes to
achieve a given accuracy in approximating model evidence (or so I understood, although this
could be made more explicit). The issues I have with this paper stem mainly from the lack of
transparency in the description of particular parts of the algorithms which are essential to the
comparisons. I commend the authors for providing neatly written code which was easy to
compile and run. My comments follow.
1. In Section 4, the authors rely extensively on the notion of the effective sample size, or
alternatively the number of iterations taken to produce an independent sample. It is well known
that this quantity can be computed in many different ways, and can be noisy. Geyer (1992) is a
main reference for this. Also the way in which it is computed can have drastic impact on the
conclusions of comparisons of MCMC algorithms. See for example the discussion in the
Appendix of Hoffman and Gelman (2011). I think the authors can say more here than 'the
distributions ... are problem dependent'. How does this impact the strength of the argument the
authors are making on the relative computational costs?
2. Following on from this point, the material in appendix E was difficult to follow in parts. Please
justify after (E2) why making the approximation log(1+x) ~ x is valid here- i.e. argue in orders of
magnitude for when p is a pdf and a pmf term. There is a typo in (E4). The argument the authors
were making in (E5) was a little difficult to follow, and I'd suggest using notation consistent with
the remainder of the text.
3. The adapting scheme in Appendix B, would look better if you drew on the theory behind
adaptive Monte Carlo (eg Andrieu and Thoms, 2008). It is essentially what you are doing, but will
provide a better justification and will allow you to adjust the proposal to target a particular
acceptance rate. This should help in the presentation.
4. Equation (D1) has a typo (theta-theta)
5. Although it is said otherwise in the text, Figure 2 really does give the impression that the DIC is
supposed to be approximating the analytical curve and as a result is performing poorly. I find
this figure misleading, and think you should find a better way to represent what you are trying to
say.
6. I found the experiments in Section 5.1 and 5.2 poorly explained. For example, the true model is
not even stated and it is not possible to deduce what it should be from the text. When you speak
of a "varying number of regressors" (4th paragraph, pg 18), you don't say which of the models the
MCMC is being run for. There will be J distinct models with J_sel=1, J choose 2 distinct with
J_sel=2 etc. This needs to be carefully rewritten. It was not possible to evaluate the study for
correctness based on the presentation in my opinion. The "details of MCMC" provided in
appendix H only described the proposal mechanism! Similar comments can be made about
Section 5.2. All experiments should be made more explicit, either in the text or appendix.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The paper is concerned with Bayesian model choice. In particular, the authors are concerned with
comparing via a simulation study for three different modelling scenario (linear regression,
random effects models and infectious disease models) the steppingstone sampling method
(which offers a way to estimate the marginal likelihood) and the Deviance Information Criterion
(DIC). The former (SS) is one of the recently developed methods for calculating a model's
evidence whilst the latter (DIC) has been widely used in the statistical literature.
In brief, I believe the paper is worthy of publication because is concerned with an important topic
but I am afraid not in its current format for the reasons I explain below. My view is that the
authors should substantially revise before considered for publication.
1. First of all, the title suggests that using the marginal likelihood gives better results than using
DIC. Actually, that is known anyway, in the sense that in a probabilistic sense and within a
Bayesian framework when comparing models, what one wants is the posterior model
probabilities which in turn will enable one to calculate the Bayes factors. On the other hand, as it
is stated in the Introduction of the paper as an approximate method to do model selection.
Therefore, when one comparing something that is approximate versus its exact analogue, there is
no question as to which one will be better. Instead, one question that might be of interest is how
good the approximate method is.
4
2. Generally, I did not find the paper particularly well written. It feels like that it was put together
quickly with not much care.
i) For example, I would have expected a bit more detail as to how the Steppingstone sampling
algorithm works. Having read Section 2 of the paper I am not clear as what the algorithm is doing
and what are the challenges for example when being implemented.
ii) There are some terms that are used in the text that are not so standard. For example
- the term "observation probability" (top of pg 5, and just before 3.2) is rather unusual as opposed
to the observed data likelihood.
- Also, in Section 3 it says "how well the model predicts" the data as opposed to "how well the
model fits the data"?
- in the Introduction the term "multi-model Bayesian inference" is also unsual/non-standard.
Why not use say something like "Bayesian Model Choice"?
- In the paragraph just before Section 2, it suggests that methods such as annealed importance
sampling, and the steppingstone algorithm can estimate exactly the marginal likelihood, while
thermodynamic integration is some sort of approximate method. I don't think that it is true in the
sense that all three are exact in a Monte Carlo sense.
iii) With regards to the examples presented, I find the ones one linear regression not to be a
representative one for the reason that methods in which the model evidence is computed, are
suited when there is only a handful of models in hand to compare. In a linear regression with J
covariates the number of possible models is massive and it is not practical to compute the
evidence for each model. Reversible jump is much more suited for this case or even using BIC as
an approximation to Bayes Factors (see 'bicglm' in R for example)
The example on the epidemic model is much more interesting because, one often has to choose
between a handful of models and it is a problem which involves missing data and it is not
obvious which version of DIC to use.
My suggestion would be to to focus on the epidemic model example as well as the mixed effect
examples (similar to the paper by Friel and Pettit on Power posteriors (aka thermodynamic
integration).
3. A major aspect of the paper is that computing the evidence is not more computationally
intensive than computing the DIC. At first glance, it is not obvious why this is the case. I think the
authors should explain a bit more clearly how the computational cost is computed.

appendix H only described the proposal mechanism! Similar comments can be made about
Section 5.2. All experiments should be made more explicit, either in the text or appendix.

Thanks for your fast re-submission, and for agreeing with my substantial points. Thanks also for
the correction re WBIC (I was indeed thinking of WAIC). I actually do not agree with your point
that one would expect DIC to select the data generating model if this model is of low dimension;
however I am prepared to recommend acceptance and let the readers judge. On the other hand, I
must insist on one change to the abstract: you persist in using the term "capability", but at least
you define it; you also use the word "reliable" but do not define it; I therefore ask you to change
the word "reliable" to "capable".
Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-171519.R2)
The following changes have been made to remove any references to "reliability":
1) In the abstract the following sentence has been used:
"Whilst DIC was found to correctly identify the true model when applied to linear regression
models, it led to incorrect model choice in the other two cases."
2) At the bottom of page 13, the sentence has been altered:
"In fact all four DIC measures incorrectly identify the true model under at least one scenario."

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_6
This paper compares stepping stone algorithms to DIC for model selection and claims that the
stepping stone algorithms are superior. The main form of comparison is to compare runtimes to
achieve a given accuracy in approximating model evidence (or so I understood, although this could
be made more explicit).
To make it clearer that DIC is a different measure to model evidence the following sentence has
been changed in the abstract:
“In contrast, the widely used deviance information criterion (DIC), a different measure that balances
model accuracy against complexity, is commonly considered a much faster alternative.”
Furthermore, the main aims of the paper are now clarified in the abstract:
“This paper compares both the capability (i.e. ability to select the true model) and speed (i.e. CPU
time to achieve a given accuracy) of DIC with model evidence calculated using steppingstone
sampling. Three important model classes are considered: linear regression models, mixed models,
and compartmental models widely used in epidemiology. Whilst DIC was found to be reliable when
applied to linear regression models, it led to incorrect model choice in the other two cases. On the
other hand, model evidence led to correct model choice in all cases considered. Importantly, and
perhaps surprisingly, DIC and model evidence were found to run at similar computational speeds, a
result reinforced by analytically derived expressions.”
The issues I have with this paper stem mainly from the lack of transparency in the description of
particular parts of the algorithms which are essential to the comparisons. I commend the authors
for providing neatly written code which was easy to compile and run. My comments follow.
1. In Section 4, the authors rely extensively on the notion of the effective sample size, or
alternatively the number of iterations taken to produce an independent sample. It is well known
that this quantity can be computed in many different ways, and can be noisy. Geyer (1992) is a
main reference for this. Also the way in which it is computed can have drastic impact on the
conclusions of comparisons of MCMC algorithms. See for example the discussion in the Appendix of
Hoffman and Gelman (2011).
It is important to note that whilst section 4 (which is an analytical treatment of the problem) relies
on effective sample size, the numerical comparison of computational times does not. This
clarification has been made in the text by adding the following paragraph in section 5.1:
“Next, we investigate the speed with which the various model selection measures can be estimated.
This is achieved by running a large number (100) of independent runs of a given inference algorithm
(either DIC or SS), and then calculating the CPU time after which the standard deviation in the model
selection measure across runs falls below a certain critical value (which is taken to be 0.2). Further
details of this procedure are given in ESM Appendix I.”
Coming back to the point about effective sample size in section 4, nowhere in the paper is it actually
calculated, so the problems mentioned by the referee do not arise. However, for completeness we
now include in Appendix F a description of how it would be calculated in practice (at least for the
most commonly used approach). Furthermore, Appendix E now explicitly shows how the definition
for the effective sample size is derived.
I think the authors can say more here than 'the distributions ... are problem dependent'. How does
this impact the strength of the argument the authors are making on the relative computational
costs?
In the text we have brought out the most notable feature of the expression for SS in Eq.(18), namely
that the results is independent of the number of chains:
“The distributions for <U+F073> k and nk are problem dependent, thus making it difficult to definitively say
cor
which approach is the fastest, however the above expressions do enable a broad comparison. One
key point to mention is that the computational efficiency for SS in Eq.(18) is independent of K for
large K (if K is doubled then the temperature separation is approximately halved and these
contributions cancel out)1. This result is surprising, and goes some way to explain why despite the
fact that SS uses K=50 chains in this study it is comparable in speed to DIC which uses just a single
chain K=1.”
2. Following on from this point, the material in appendix E was difficult to follow in parts. Please
justify after (E2) why making the approximation log(1+x) ~ x is valid here- i.e. argue in orders of
magnitude for when p is a pdf and a pmf term. There is a typo in (E4). The argument the authors
were making in (E5) was a little difficult to follow, and I'd suggest using notation consistent with
the remainder of the text.
Appendix E has largely been rewritten to show a more straightforward derivation of the analytical
results.
3. The adapting scheme in Appendix B, would look better if you drew on the theory behind
adaptive Monte Carlo (eg Andrieu and Thoms, 2008). It is essentially what you are doing, but will
provide a better justification and will allow you to adjust the proposal to target a particular
acceptance rate. This should help in the presentation.
It is certainly true to say that there are clear parallels with adaptive MCMC. However, in contrast to
adaptive MCMC, here we do not change proposal distributions after the burn-in time. Thus, strictly
speaking, what we implement is a tuning procedure. This was considered to be the best approach
for this particular paper, as it avoids unnecessary issues related to the violation of detailed balance.
We have added the following sentence to Appendix B:
1
So an algorithm which uses K=100 chains is no slower than one which uses K=50 chains. This remains true for
larger and larger K until burning-in such a substantial number of chains becomes problematic.
“Motivated by adaptive MCMC, a robust heuristic method for optimising <U+03BB>k,j within the burn-in
period is as follows (note, after burn-in the proposal distributions are fixed to ensure that detailed
balance is strictly satisfied).”
4. Equation (D1) has a typo (theta-theta)
Thank you for pointing this out. It has been corrected.
5. Although it is said otherwise in the text, Figure 2 really does give the impression that the DIC is
supposed to be approximating the analytical curve and as a result is performing poorly. I find this
figure misleading, and think you should find a better way to represent what you are trying to say.
Figure 2 has now been split up to avoid this confusion. Furthermore, the following sentences have
been added to the text:
“Figure 2 illustrates notable differences between DIC and evidence-based measures. It is important
to emphasise that these differences do not arise from DIC inaccurately approximating the evidence.
Rather, the two approaches are simply different measures arising from contrasting philosophies:”
6. I found the experiments in Section 5.1 and 5.2 poorly explained. For example, the true model is
not even stated and it is not possible to deduce what it should be from the text. When you speak of
a "varying number of regressors" (4th paragraph, pg 18), you don't say which of the models the
MCMC is being run for. There will be J distinct models with J_sel=1, J choose 2 distinct with J_sel=2
etc. This needs to be carefully rewritten. It was not possible to evaluate the study for correctness
based on the presentation in my opinion.
The reviewer is correct in stating that we do not consider all possible models (this of course would
usually become impractical when Jsel is large). The idea behind the figures which have Jsel on the x-
axis was simply to cut across a range of possible models to visually show how well the various
algorithms perform. We believe this is of value, and have therefore focused on improving the text.
The following description has been added to section 5.1 to incorporate the reviewer’s comments
and also clarify what we have done and why:
“In terms of model selection, one of the key difficulties faced by the scientist is determining which
regressors are genuine (i.e. actually affect the observations) and which are not. Specifically, suppose
data are available from J’ potential regressors, where J’ is greater than (or equal to) the true
number of regressors J. We denote <U+03BA> as a J’ dimensional vector that specifies a particular model,
such that <U+03BA>j=1 if the model contains regressor j and <U+03BA>j=0 otherwise. Thus, in total 2J’ possible
models exist. If J’ is small then it may be practical to calculate model selection measures for each
possibility, but as J’ increases the number of potential models can become vast. In this case two
approaches can be taken: 1) in a Bayesian setting model selection MCMC [25] can be used to
generate posterior samples for the vector <U+03BA> [25] and 2) stepwise methods [26] which minimise the
model selection measure by accepting or rejecting successive changes to the model (see ESM
Appendices G and H for details).
The focus of this paper, however, is not to get into the details of how model selection is actually
achieved using these two approaches. Rather, a question of more fundamental importance is
addressed: Is the model selection measure actually minimised at (or near to) the true model? We
address this question by considering a simple toy example. Here J’=10 regressors are assumed to
exist (elements of the design matrix Xrj for j=2…J’ are set to 0 or 1 with equal probability). The first 5
of these regressors are assumed to actually influence the trait and the last five have no influence (i.e.
the true model is represented by <U+03BA>j=1 for j=1…5 and <U+03BA>j=0 for j=6…10). R=100 measurements are
simulated from the true model by means of Eq.(19) assuming J=J’, ßj=0.5 for j=1…5, ßj=0 for j=6…10,
and residual variance is taken to be <U+03B7>2=1.
Next we consider a subset of potential models which are characterised by the number of regressors
Jsel they contain and defined such that <U+03BA>j=1 for j=Jsel and <U+03BA>j=0 for j>Jsel (note here that Jsel=5
represents the true model). The priors for ßj are taken to be uniform between -2 and 2, and for <U+03B7>2
uniform between 0.1 and 2 (these bounds ensure the prior is proper and sufficiently diffuse to have
a negligible effect on the posterior distribution as compared to using an infinite flat prior2). Figure
3(a) shows the various model selection measures as a function of Jsel (details of the MCMC
implementation are provided in ESM Appendix J). The results using model evidence are shown by
the solid red line. Those models with Jsel < 5 are missing certain factors that help to explain the data,
so naturally they are not expected to be as good (i.e. there is less evidence supporting them so -
2log(P(y)) is higher). Those models with Jsel > 5 contain extra model parameters not expected to
provide any new information (as they were not used in generating the data). Consequently the solid
curve has a long term upward trajectory towards the right of Fig. 3(a). The minimum lies at Jsel =5,
indicating that model evidence had successfully identified the true model.”
Furthermore, two new Appendices G and H have been added to explain model selection techniques
when a large number of models are considered.
The "details of MCMC" provided in appendix H only described the proposal mechanism! Similar
comments can be made about Section 5.2. All experiments should be made more explicit, either in
the text or appendix.
The following additional description has been added to Appendix J (which provides MCMC details for
the linear regression model):
“In the case of DIC, updates are sequentially performed on the posterior chain and the proposals are
accepted with the usual Metropolis-Hastings probability
<U+F0EF> P( y | <U+F071> p , x p )<U+F070> ( x p | <U+F071> p )<U+F070> (<U+F071> p ) j p<U+F0AE>i <U+F0FC>

<U+F0EE> <U+F0EF>
where <U+F071>i , xi are the current model parameters and latent variables and <U+F071> p , x p are the proposed set.
In the case of SS each chain k is updated sequentially, but this time proposals are accepted with a
modified Metropolis-Hastings probability

Note, a conjugate prior (instead of this flat prior) is often used to rapidly increase the speed at which the
model evidence can be calculated. Since this paper is focused on the generic performance of DIC and model
evidence measures we do not make use of this mathematical “trick”.

models and compartmental models.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_7
The paper is concerned with Bayesian model choice. In particular, the authors are concerned with
comparing via a simulation study for three different modelling scenario (linear regression, random
effects models and infectious disease models) the steppingstone sampling method (which offers a
way to estimate the marginal likelihood) and the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC). The former
(SS) is one of the recently developed methods for calculating a model's evidence whilst the latter
(DIC) has been widely used in the statistical literature.
In brief, I believe the paper is worthy of publication because is concerned with an important topic
but I am afraid not in its current format for the reasons I explain below. My view is that the
authors should substantially revise before considered for publication.
1. First of all, the title suggests that using the marginal likelihood gives better results than using
DIC. Actually, that is known anyway, in the sense that in a probabilistic sense and within a
Bayesian framework when comparing models, what one wants is the posterior model probabilities
which in turn will enable one to calculate the Bayes factors. On the other hand, as it is stated in the
Introduction of the paper as an approximate method to do model selection. Therefore, when one
comparing something that is approximate versus its exact analogue, there is no question as to
which one will be better. Instead, one question that might be of interest is how good the
approximate method is.
In fact DIC is not an approximate method for calculating model evidence, a point we have tried to
clarify by making changes to the abstract:
“In contrast, the widely used deviance information criterion (DIC), a different measure that balances
model accuracy against complexity, is commonly considered a much faster alternative.”
and in section 3.3:
“Figure 2 illustrates notable differences between DIC and evidence-based measures. It is important
to emphasise that these differences do not arise from DIC inaccurately approximating the evidence.
Rather, the two approaches are simply different measures arising from contrasting philosophies: “
Taking on board the comments from the reviewer, we have renamed the paper to more accurately
reflect its content:
“Bayesian model evidence as a practical alternative to deviance information criterion”
2. Generally, I did not find the paper particularly well written. It feels like that it was put together
quickly with not much care.
We believe the changes below (along with other small modifications to improve the readability)
have improved the paper.
In particular the main aims of the paper are now clarified in the abstract:
“This paper compares both the capability (i.e. ability to select the true model) and speed (i.e. CPU
time to achieve a given accuracy) of DIC with model evidence calculated using steppingstone
sampling. Three important model classes are considered: linear regression models, mixed models,
and compartmental models widely used in epidemiology. Whilst DIC was found to be reliable when
applied to linear regression models, it led to incorrect model choice in the other two cases. On the
other hand, model evidence led to correct model choice in all cases considered. Importantly, and
perhaps surprisingly, DIC and model evidence were found to run at similar computational speeds, a
result reinforced by analytically derived expressions.”
Appendix E has largely been rewritten to show a more straightforward derivation of the analytical
results, along with the addition of Appendices G and H, a new theory section in Appendix A, and
more detail on MCMC implantation in Appendices J, L and N.
i) For example, I would have expected a bit more detail as to how the Steppingstone sampling
algorithm works. Having read Section 2 of the paper I am not clear as what the algorithm is doing
and what are the challenges for example when being implemented.
More detain has now been added to section 2:
“As with any MCMC, each of these chains undergoes changes as a result of proposals that are either
accepted or rejected. These proposals can take a variety of forms (e.g. random walk [1], Gibbs
sampling [21], Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm [22] etc..) and must be selected such that the
MCMC chain can, in principle at least, explore the entirety of parameter and latent variable space. A
key difference between SS and ordinary MCMC is that the proposals for each chain k use a
Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability modified by the chain’s inverse temperature <U+03D5>k : “
Furthermore, a new section in Appendix A has been added to provide a theoretical justification for
the expression in Eq.(6).
ii) There are some terms that are used in the text that are not so standard. For example
- the term "observation probability" (top of pg 5, and just before 3.2) is rather unusual as opposed
to the observed data likelihood.
We have changed "observation probability" to “observed data likelihood”.
- Also, in Section 3 it says "how well the model predicts" the data as opposed to "how well the
model fits the data"?
This has been corrected.
- in the Introduction the term "multi-model Bayesian inference" is also unsual/non-standard. Why
not use say something like "Bayesian Model Choice"?
This has been changed.
- In the paragraph just before Section 2, it suggests that methods such as annealed importance
sampling, and the steppingstone algorithm can estimate exactly the marginal likelihood, while
thermodynamic integration is some sort of approximate method. I don't think that it is true in the
sense that all three are exact in a Monte Carlo sense.
Thermodynamic integration techniques all involve replacing an integral with some sort of numerical
approximation (e.g. the trapezoidal rule). For example, see Friel and Pettitt [1]. This error is on top of
the usual Monte Carlo sampling error and results in bias (regardless of how many samples are
taken).
iii) With regards to the examples presented, I find the ones one linear regression not to be a
representative one for the reason that methods in which the model evidence is computed, are
suited when there is only a handful of models in hand to compare. In a linear regression with J
covariates the number of possible models is massive and it is not practical to compute the evidence
for each model. Reversible jump is much more suited for this case or even using BIC as an
approximation to Bayes Factors (see 'bicglm' in R for example)
The description of the linear regression model in section 5.1 has been substantially revised:
“In terms of model selection, one of the key difficulties faced by the scientist is determining which
regressors are genuine (i.e. actually affect the observations) and which are not. Specifically, suppose
data are available from J’ potential regressors, where J’ is greater than (or equal to) the true
number of regressors J. We denote <U+03BA> as a J’ dimensional vector that specifies a particular model,
such that <U+03BA>j=1 if the model contains regressor j and <U+03BA>j=0 otherwise. Thus, in total 2J’ possible
models exist. If J’ is small then it may be practical to calculate model selection measures for each
possibility, but as J’ increases the number of potential models can become vast. In this case two
approaches can be taken: 1) in a Bayesian setting model selection MCMC [25] can be used to
generate posterior samples for the vector <U+03BA> [25] and 2) stepwise methods [26] which minimise the
model selection measure by accepting or rejecting successive changes to the model (see ESM
Appendices G and H for details).
The focus of this paper, however, is not to get into the details of how model selection is actually
achieved using these two approaches. Rather, a question of more fundamental importance is
addressed: Is the model selection measure actually minimised at (or near to) the true model? We
address this question by considering a simple toy example. Here J’=10 regressors are assumed to
exist (elements of the design matrix Xrj for j=2…J’ are set to 0 or 1 with equal probability). The first 5
of these regressors are assumed to actually influence the trait and the last five have no influence (i.e.
the true model is represented by <U+03BA>j=1 for j=1…5 and <U+03BA>j=0 for j=6…10). R=100 measurements are
simulated from the true model by means of Eq.(19) assuming J=J’, ßj=0.5 for j=1…5, ßj=0 for j=6…10,
and residual variance is taken to be <U+03B7>2=1.
Next we consider a subset of potential models which are characterised by the number of regressors
Jsel they contain and defined such that <U+03BA>j=1 for j=Jsel and <U+03BA>j=0 for j>Jsel (note here that Jsel=5
represents the true model). The priors for ßj are taken to be uniform between -2 and 2, and for <U+03B7>2
uniform between 0.1 and 2 (these bounds ensure the prior is proper and sufficiently diffuse to have
a negligible effect on the posterior distribution as compared to using an infinite flat prior3). Figure
3(a) shows the various model selection measures as a function of Jsel (details of the MCMC
implementation are provided in ESM Appendix J). The results using model evidence are shown by
the solid red line. Those models with Jsel < 5 are missing certain factors that help to explain the data,

so naturally they are not expected to be as good (i.e. there is less evidence supporting them so -
2log(P(y)) is higher). Those models with Jsel > 5 contain extra model parameters not expected to
provide any new information (as they were not used in generating the data). Consequently the solid
curve has a long term upward trajectory towards the right of Fig. 3(a). The minimum lies at Jsel =5,
indicating that model evidence had successfully identified the true model.”
Two new Appendices G and H have been incorporated to explain how large numbers of models can
be dealt with effectively when model evidence is used in practice.
The example on the epidemic model is much more interesting because, one often has to choose
between a handful of models and it is a problem which involves missing data and it is not obvious
which version of DIC to use.
My suggestion would be to to focus on the epidemic model example as well as the mixed effect
examples (similar to the paper by Friel and Pettit on Power posteriors (aka thermodynamic
integration).
Our feeling is that the paper benefits from also containing the linear regression model. In going from
a linear to a mixed to a compartmental model there is a natural progression from posteriors which
are well represented by multivariate normal distributions, to ones that aren’t. In conjunction with
this we provide an example of when DIC performs well, and one in which it doesn’t perform well.
Without the linear regression model the paper would no longer contain an example for which DIC
works. We feel this would be unrepresentative and its inclusion makes for a more balanced paper.
3. A major aspect of the paper is that computing the evidence is not more computationally
intensive than computing the DIC. At first glance, it is not obvious why this is the case. I think the
authors should explain a bit more clearly how the computational cost is computed.
As mentioned above, additional text has been added into section 5.1 to clearly explain how the
computational cost is calculated:
“Next, we investigate the speed with which the various model selection measures can be estimated.
This is achieved by running a large number (100) of independent runs of a given inference algorithm
(either DIC or SS), and then calculating the CPU time after which the standard deviation in the model
selection measure across runs falls below a certain critical value (which is taken to be 0.2). Further
details of this procedure are given in ESM Appendix I.”
A key insight in explaining why steppingstone sampling is not slower than the calculation of DIC
comes from the analytical expressions shown in Eq.(18) where the number of updates needed to
achieve a certain level of accuracy is independent on the number of chains used. This has been
clarified in section 4 by adding the paragraph:
“The distributions for <U+F073> k and nk are problem dependent, thus making it difficult to definitively say
cor
which approach is the fastest, however the above expressions do enable a broad comparison. One
key point to mention is that the computational efficiency for SS in Eq.(18) is independent of K for
large K (if K is doubled then the temperature separation is approximately halved and these
contributions cancel out)4. This result is surprising, and goes some way to explain why despite the
fact that SS uses K=50 chains in this study it is comparable in speed to DIC which uses just a single
chain K=1.”

the Royal Statistical Society. Series B (Statistical Methodology) 70, 589-607.

So an algorithm which uses K=100 chains is no slower than one which uses K=50 chains. This remains true for
larger and larger K until burning-in such a substantial number of chains becomes problematic.
Appendix B
Firstly, we would like to thank the editor for going through the paper so carefully and
providing many useful comments. We have address these as described below.

alternative to deviance information criterion."

Substantive comments
1. The authors have done a good job of responding to author's comments and sug-
gestions. They have not made every change suggested (e.g., the linear regression
example is still prominent) but justify themselves well. I therefore elected not to
send the paper back out for review.
2. One substantive issue remaining, however, is the basis for comparison of DIC and
model evidence (via the SS algorithm) as model selection methods. The authors
have added text to clarify that DIC and model evidence are different measures
arising from contrasting philosophies", however they persist in using selection of
the true model as a measure of the \capability" of the approaches. As they are
no doubt aware, and as is explicit in the original DIC paper (Spiegelhalter et al.
2002) and the follow-up (Spiegelhalter et al. 2014), DIC is not attempting to find
the true model, rather it is attempting to find the model that can produce the best
prediction of future, unobserved data in a world where the \true model" (i.e., true
data generating process) is very high dimensional. One example comes from page
3 of the latter paper, under section 4 (regarding common criticisms of DIC): \Lack
of consistency: the lack of consistency concerns many critics, but the stated aim of
DIC is in optimizing short-term predictions of a particular type, and not in trying
to identify the `true' model: except in rare and stylized circumstances, we contend
that such an entity is an unattainable ideal."
In order for the manuscript to be acceptable, the authors should alter their text
so that it is clear what the goals of the different measures are, and that it is clear
that DIC is not failing by not finding the true model. Terms such as “capability",
“reliable" and “unreliable" should not be used in the context of DIC not finding
the true model. The authors should then either (1) make it clear that they are
only testing one aspect of model selection (finding the true model when truth is low
dimensional) and that one does not expect DIC to perform well on this measure,
or (2) add consideration of performance in selecting a model that produces good
short-term predictions in situations where the “true model" is high dimensional.
We are grateful to the editor for raising these very interesting points that we hadn’t
addressed. To do so we have added the following paragraph at the end of section 3.3:
“Furthermore, it should be stressed that the stated aim of DIC is not to find the “true ” model, but
rather to accurately predict future datasets in a world in which the true data generating is, in fact,
very high dimensional (and effectively unobtainable) [6,7]. Nevertheless, this paper contends that in
situations in which the true model is low dimensional and exactly know (as it is for the simulated
datasets in section 5) it should be expected that DIC does a reasonable job of selecting the true
model, since simulation of the observed data from the true model intuitively seems more plausibl e
than from an incorrect one. Therefore, this paper uses model selection, rather than prediction
accuracy (or any other measure of model fit, such as posterior predictive assessment [25]), as a
means of comparing DIC and model evidence, but concedes that this is not an entirely fair
comparison.”
and the following sentence in the conclusion:
“Whilst DIC has not been developed with model selection in mind (rather it is concerned with
prediction accuracy of future datasets), this lack of consistency between measures (in some cases
suggesting completely the wrong model), is of great concern.”
3. There is still not enough information in the “Results" section for readers to recreate
what was done - something that is at the heart of the Open Science philosophy.
For example, I believe that the number of replicate simulations of data generation
(possibly just one), the sample size of observations and the true parameter values are
not given for the linear regression example. There is missing information also in the
other examples. All relevant information must be given; it would also be helpful to
supply relevant code for all examples, as was done for the linear regression example.

This information was placed into the Appendices (e.g. information about replicates and
sample size was in Appendix I). For clarity, this has now been also added to the main text:
“To generate the results in the paper 2×103 burn-in updates were followed by N=105 sampling
updates in the case of SS and N=106 sampling updates in the case of DIC.”
and
“To remove stochastic noise, the procedure is replicated over four data sets with the CPU times
being averaged (further details are given in ESM Appendix I).”
The parameter values are now also mentioned in the legends in various places.
Furthermore, the code for the mixed and epidemiological models has now been incorporated
into the supplementary material.
Minor and editorial comments
1. Page 3, line 16 (line numbers taken from the margin of the pdf). SS is only a
practical
alternative to RJMCMC when the number of models to choose among is small, or
when a shortcut like sequential model selection is employed, which can then easily
miss the “best" model. This issue needs a small mention here, at the outset.
The following sentence has been added:
“At least “practical” when the number of models to choose among is relatively small, or when
techniques such as sequential model selection are employed, which can miss the “best" model.”
2. Page 5, line 5. “Firstly" does not need capitalized.
This has been corrected.
3. Page 8. Section 5 \Results" contains methods as well as results; I suggest it be
renamed something like \Assessment using benchmark models."
This has been changed.
4. Page 9, linear regression example. This only includes main effects; if model choice
included high order interactions then sequential selection would be further
complicated (and hence RJMCMC might be preferred over SS). This should be
mentioned somewhere, here or in the discussion.
The following sentence has been added:
“It is worth noting that these stepwise methods are complicated when higher order, i.e. non-linear,
interactions in the explanatory variables are included, and under these circumstances RJMCMC may
become the method of choice.”
5. Page 9, last paragraph. This is an example of where it is implicit the DIC should
perform well in selecting the true model.
The following sentence has been added
“Note, this is an example in which it is implicit that DIC should perform well.”
6. Page 10, footnote 9. Remove “rapidly"?
This has been corrected.
7. Page 12, first two lines. It is difficult from the figure to determine the numerical
difference in model selection measures ( can these be added in a table, in an
Appendix)?
A table has been placed into Appendix O and referred to from Fig. 4.
8. Page 12, line 41. Acronyms like SEIR need defining.
The following sentence has been added:
“Individuals in the population are classified according to their disease status: S represents
susceptible, E is exposed, I is infectious and R is recovered. The acronyms used to refer to the models
in Fig. 5 correspond to which of these classifications the model contains (so, in order, these models
are SI, SEI, SIR and SEIR, respectively).”
9. Page 14, last paragraph of Discussion ”computational" should be
“computationally"
This has been corrected.
10. Page 14, last paragraph of Discussion. WBIC is, like DIC, a parsimony-based
measure, so suggesting it as an alternative to SS seems incongruous to me. At the
least, the goal of this measure should be mentioned.
WBIC is expected to converge on the model evidence in the asymptotic limit. Perhaps what
is being referred to is WAIC? Nevertheless, we have tried to improve what was written in the
conclusion:
“One promising possibility is the widely applicable Bayesian information criterion (WBIC) [34]. This
calculates the mean in the log of the observation probability at a specially chosen inverse
temperature <U+03D5>* = 1/log(n), where n is the sample size. It has been shown that whilst WBIC
converges on the model evidence in the asymptotically limit [34], i.e. as n<U+2192> 8, it can also produce
biased results for small sample sizes and when priors are not very informative [35].”
11. Figure 1 legend. y-axis in (a) is described in the text (p4 line 14) as the average log
of the observed data likelihood, where here it is described as the distribution in the
log of the observed data likelihood. Please clarify the legend (and say what kind of
average). Also, what are the dashed lines bracketing the solid line? Lastly, note that
here and in several other places in the legends, there is a font issue with a sans-serif
font slipping into the text in places.
The legend has been altered:
“Shows a typical example of how the posterior distribution in the log of the observed data likelihood
varies as a function of inverse temperature <U+03D5>. This distribution is represented by a mean (solid line)
and 95% confidence intervals (denoted by the dotted lines).”
As well as the text in the paper:
“Fig. 1(a) shows the variation in the mean of the log of the observed data likelihood”
Font errors have also been corrected.
12. Appendices. Dashed boxes appear above many symbols in equations (e.g., 1st P
in A1, wk in A1, 1st P in A8, _ and _ in F1 and F2, etc. Please, when you re-
submit, submit the appendices in pdf form and check that all equations are correctly
formatted.
This has been done.
13. Appendix E. Neff is used here in equations before it is defined (in Appendix F) {
please ensure a suitable forward reference is added the first time Neff is used.
This has been done.
14. Appendix F. I didn't understand equation F5 (should the > be <)?
This equation is correct. The autocorrelation F0 starts at one and as t is increased so Ft
decreases. If Eq. (F5) stated F<U+F074> <U+F03E> 0 , this would imply that we should only use t up until the
point at which the autocorrelation function becomes negative. The actual condition in Eq.(F5)
is slightly more complicated. This is down to a curious quirk of autocorrelation functions
generated from MCMC: in the limit of large sample size the sum of adjacent autocorrelation
values is guaranteed to be positive (but individual values themselves are not). This has now
been clarified in the text.
