The classical variational principle has encountered great difficulties in promoting non-
conservative or non-holonomic systems. However, Herglotz variational principle can give a
variational description of non-conservative dynamical systems. The time-delayed system is an
important dynamical system. Based on Herglotz variational principle, this article studied the
Noether symmetry and conserved quantity for a time-delayed Hamiltonian system. The
derivation and proof of this article is rigorous, the result is correct, the English expression is good.
This is an innovative paper in the research of Noether symmetry. I strongly recommend that it be
acceptable for publication in Royal Open Science after following minor revisions:
- In the abstract and everywhere else, it is suggested to change “Noether’s theorem for the
variational problem of Herglotz type in phase space” to “Noether’s theorem of a Hamiltonian
system based on the variational problem of Herglotz type”.
- In this article, the author adopts the Einstein summation convention, it is suggested to explain in
the first appearance.
- In formulae (19) and (47), “s=1,2,…,n” may be changed to “s,k=1,2,…,n”.
I recommend the article to be published in Royal Open Science.

This paper extends the variational problem of Herglotz type to a time-delayed Hamiltonian
system, and studies the Noether symmetry and the conserved quantity for the system based on
the generalized variational principle of Herglotz type. Its main results are Theorem 1, Theorem 2
and Theorem 3. They are new and important. So, I think that this paper can be published in your
journal.

highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your

can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).

Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article

Dear Editor,
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning my

Hamiltonian system of Herglotz type”. Those comments are all valuable and very
helpful for revising and improving my paper. I have studied comments carefully and
have made correction that I hope meet with approval. Revised portion are marked in
blue in the paper. The main corrections in the paper and the responses to the
reviewers’ comments are as flowing:

a Hamiltonian system based on the variational problem of Herglotz type”.
 Response:
According to the Reviewer’s suggestion, we change “Noether’s theorem for the
variational problem of Herglotz type in phase space” to “Noether’s theorem of a
Hamiltonian system based on the variational problem of Herglotz type”.
 Comments 2:
- In this article, the author adopts the Einstein summation convention, it is
suggested to explain in the first appearance.
 Response:
According to the Reviewer’s suggestion, we add a sentence "Here and later we use
the Einstein summation convention on repeated indices" in the penultimate line 4 of
section 2.
 Comments 3:
- In formulae (19) and (47), “s=1,2,…,n” may be changed to “s,k=1,2,…,n”.
 Response:
According to the Reviewer’s suggestion, we change “s=1,2,…,n” to
“s,k=1,2,…,n” in formulae (19) and (47).

Thanks for peer reviewer’s comments.
Above is a list of changes for each point that two reviewers ask to follow. I
appreciate for you and two reviewers’ warm work earnestly, and hope that the
correction will meet with approval.
Once again, thank you very much for you and for anonymous reviewers’ good
