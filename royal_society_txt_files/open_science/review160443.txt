I have reviewed the manuscript “Quantitative characterisation of spatial patterns in dryland
vegetation” by Mander et al. With this manuscript, the authors aim to provide a novel measure to
quantify spatial patterns of vegetation in drylands. The manuscript is well written and the
general idea behind such a novel measure is interesting. Hence, this paper would make a fine
contribution to better quantifying vegetation structure in drylands.
The authors argue that there is “no unique measure that captures all aspects of pattern
morphology” and they intend to provide such a missing “holistic” measure with this study.
However, my overall impression is that this goal is a bit too ambitious and actually not met with
this new statistic. Herewith, I am explaining why this is my impression.
While their measure is certainly interesting, it cannot be considered (as claimed by the authors in
line 274) as “an alternative to the existing ways” of describing spatial vegetation patterns such as
i.e. done by a Fourier analysis. More precisely, the new measure does actually not characterize
the true spatial distribution patterns of vegetation - at least not in a spatially explicit way but only
in a spatially implicit manner with a focus on shapes/pattern morphologies. Hence, the measure
does not account for the spatial variation of vegetation patterns along a continuous range of
neighborhood radii which would be caused by scale-dependent plant competition for water. Such
self-organized spatial vegetation patterns are characterized by the spatially explicit distribution of
structural nodes that lead to a specific wavelength of the vegetation pattern (as can be e.g.
analyzed with a Fourier analysis). This wavelength results from feedback-driven spatial plant
competition and it has to be analyzed at the landscape scale within a spatially explicit approach
because the change of vegetation patterning along water-stress gradients happens at continuous
neighborhood scales. Recent examples of such a characterization of vegetation gap patterns
within a spatially-explicit framework have been shown by e.g. Getzin et al. (2015, 2016). Since the
authors are not using such a set of spatial correlation functions to analyze the patterns, I would
suggest to present this novel tool rather as an “additional” structural measure but not as “an
alternative to the existing ways”. In order to avoid confusion with a true spatial pattern analysis
of vegetation distributions, possibly the title could be changed to e.g. “Quantitative
characterisation of pattern morphologies in dryland vegetation“.
Besides this I have another, more minor point to criticize. At lines 149-160 I found it confusing
that the authors are once using “foreground pixels for simulated vegetation” but “background
pixels for satellite images”. The resulting opposite slopes and positions of e.g. spot patterns in
Figures 4a and 4b (see Results lines 189-194) make the interpretation of the statistic very
confusing. Therefore, I suggest to use also for simulated vegetation black background pixels but
white pixel for non-vegetation. This is standard for simulated data see e.g. Meron (2016), Getzin
et al. (2015) or the cited study of von Hardenberg et al. (2001). With little photogrammetric effort,
simulated vegetation patches can be easily converted into black pixels.
Other minor points:
Lines 65-69:
This paragraph is not up-to-date. Besides enhanced infiltration and extensive lateral roots, there
is a third feedback-mechanism which may induce vegetation patterns. This is the fast soil-water
diffusion in porous sand, a feedback called “uptake-diffusion feedback” that requires only
confined but not extensive lateral roots. This feedback mechanism has been used in models
simulating gap patterns in Namibia (Getzin et al. 2015, 2016, Zelnik et al. 2015) and has been
more formally described by Meron (2016, cf. Fig. 3).

Line 326:
The year of the reference von Hardenberg is incorrect. It must be 2001.
Page 24, Figure 6b:
There are two vertical positions of labyrinths next to each other at 500 mm rainfall, however in
the zoomed inset image these two seem to appear above each other but not separated by the x-
axis. Is this correct? Also for the spots the inset seems to not represent the full data.

It is indeed clear how to access the image library of the satellite imagery, but it is not clear from

I find this manuscript interesting and an important contribution to the characterization of spatial
patterns in ecology. In my view it is ready for publication after addressing few issues:
4
1) The presented method for classification of vegetation patterns is not compared to the other
methods that are currently being in use in this field. It would be worthwhile to compare the new
method suggested with the characterization of vegetation pattern using Fourier analysis or
Shanon entropy. Does this method encompass the information supplied by Fourier analysis?
2) It is not mentioned in which season of the year the images of the patterned vegetation from
Sudan were collected.
3) In the Methods subsection 2.3, the explanation of the derivation of the 20 dimensional feature
vector is rather unclear. Specifically, lines 173-176 need better explanation of the calculation of the
Euler characteristic of a given subregion.
4) The term "pixel rank" is introduced in section 3.1 without previous definition.

I have reviewed the revised manuscript now and found that my concerns were largely addressed.
The new title is in my view more appropriate than the old one. I suggested to use white color for
bare soil and black color for vegetation - as is typically done in most papers - but this has not been
addressed. However, at least the authors are now using the same color for vegetation in both,
simulated and real-world satellite images.
One sentence I would like to see slightly improved. The modified paragraph in the discussion
(lines 291-308) is good but a spatially explicit Fourier analysis which looks at spectral densities is
related to but different from a spatial density function such as Ripley’s K-function or the pair-
correlation function that look at correlation of objects (used in Ref. 12,13).
Therefore, at line 295 I suggest to write more correctly: “Fourier analysis and spatial correlation
analysis are particularly well suited to...”

sentation of measure (Line 274). We have reworded this sentence:
ur approach to the characterisation of spatial patterns in dryland vegetation represents an
rnative to the existing ways of describing these patterns, which include descriptive
menclature (e.g. Fig. 1a), Shannon entropy [12] and Fourier analysis [e.g. 1–4]."
read as follows:
ur approach to the characterisation of spatial patterns in dryland vegetation represents an
itional measure of vegetation pattern morphology, which complements existing ways of
cribing of these patterns using descriptive nomenclature (e.g. Fig. 1a), Fourier analysis [e.g.
] and Shannon entropy [16]."
s sentence forms the opening of new paragraphs that we have inserted into the discussion to
her address this comment (see also response to Reviewer 2: Comparison with Fourier
lysis and Shannon entropy):
ur approach to the characterisation of spatial patterns in dryland vegetation represents an
itional measure of vegetation pattern morphology, which complements existing ways of
cribing of these patterns using descriptive nomenclature (e.g. Fig. 1a), Fourier analysis [e.g.
] and Shannon entropy [16]. Fourier analysis is particularly well suited to the analysis of
se self-organised patterns because they are characterised by the spatially explicit distribution
tructural nodes that lead to a specific vegetation pattern wavelength, which in turn gives rise
distinctive periodicity [e.g. 1]. Some recent analyses of vegetation patterns have been
ertaken in a spatially explicit framework [e.g. 12, 13]. However, our analysis, which is
ussed on the quantitative description of pattern morphology, lacks such a dynamical and
licitly spatial component in the sense that it doesn't explicitly describe how pattern
rphology changes dynamically from one point in space to another. Additionally, our dataset
imulated vegetation patterns consists of images produced at discrete rainfall intervals, and
dataset of satellite images consists of individually separate images of vegetation patterns.
discrete nature of this dataset limits our ability to examine dynamic spatially explicit
nges in vegetation pattern morphology.

es 149–160. The use of graphs formed from foreground pixels for simulated vegetation and
phs formed from background pixels for modelled vegetation is an integral part of our
lysis. However, we appreciate that the interpretation of this aspect of our work is slightly
kward, and so we have made the following modifications to the manuscript:
We have added the following sentence to section 2.2 Image segmentation:
both simulated and real-world images, vegetation patches are represented by foreground
ite) pixels, and bare ground interpatches are represented by background (black) pixels (Fig.
h)."
We have also modified section 2.3 Quantitative characterisation of vegetation patterns to
ude the following paragraph:
ese experiments indicated that for simulated vegetation, graphs formed from foreground
getated) pixels produced a clearer characterisation of the patterning than graphs formed from
kground (bare ground) pixels. The opposite was true for vegetation patterning recorded by
llite imagery, and graphs formed from background pixels produced clearer characterisation
hese real-world patterns. Accordingly, we have characterised simulated vegetation patterns
the basis of foreground shapes, and characterised real-world vegetation patterns on the basis
ackground shapes."
Additionally, in order to aid interpretation and to help orientate readers, we have added
ws to figures 4a and 4b to highlight the direction of increasing (Fig. 4a) and decreasing (Fig.

Finally, we have modified the opening paragraph of our discussion to explore this issue
her:
apes are distinguished by their complements, and in the context of the binary images in our
aset (e.g. Figs 3, 5), the foreground shapes formed of white pixels are reflected in the
kground shapes formed of black pixels and vice versa. We have made use of this observation
ur analyses by characterising modelled vegetation on the basis of foreground shapes, and
racterising real-world vegetation on the basis of background shapes. This was done primarily
rder to achieve the clearest possible separation between pattern types in PCA plots. We
pect that the clear characterization of modelled vegetation patterns using foreground
getated) pixels might be related to the fact that these simulated vegetation patches are
played as uniform green–yellow pixels with distinct and regular borders (Fig. 1b). In contrast,
vegetation patches in real-world images are frequently quite small, particularly for spotted
erns (Fig 2e–f), and have margins that are somewhat irregular (e.g. Fig. 1a)."

mparison with Fourier analysis and Shannon entropy. We have added the following text to
discussion to address this comment (see also response to Reviewer 1: Presentation of
asure (Line 274)):
ur approach to the characterisation of spatial patterns in dryland vegetation represents an
itional measure of vegetation pattern morphology, which complements existing ways of
cribing of these patterns using descriptive nomenclature (e.g. Fig. 1a), Fourier analysis [e.g.
] and Shannon entropy [16]. Fourier analysis is particularly well suited to the analysis of
se self-organised patterns because they are characterised by the spatially explicit distribution
tructural nodes that lead to a specific vegetation pattern wavelength, which in turn gives rise
distinctive periodicity [e.g. 1]. Some recent analyses of vegetation patterns have been
ertaken in a spatially explicit framework [e.g. 12, 13]. However, our analysis, which is
ussed on the quantitative description of pattern morphology, lacks such a dynamical and
licitly spatial component in the sense that it doesn't explicitly describe how pattern
rphology changes dynamically from one point in space to another. Additionally, our dataset
imulated vegetation patterns consists of images produced at discrete rainfall intervals, and
dataset of satellite images consists of individually separate images of vegetation patterns.
discrete nature of this dataset limits our ability to examine dynamic spatially explicit
nges in vegetation pattern morphology.
Nevertheless, since subgraph centrality provides a measure of both the local and the
bal connectivity of a graph [22], it can capture some spatial information from continuous

Please find attached a revision of the manuscript entitled “A morphometric analysis of vegetation
patterns in dryland ecosystems" (manuscript RSOS-160443.R1).
As requested by the reviewer, we have updated the sentence at Line 295 to read: "Fourier analysis and
spatial correlation analysis are particularly well suited to the analysis of these self-organised patterns
because they are characterised by the spatially explicit distribution of structural nodes that lead to a
specific vegetation pattern wavelength, which in turn gives rise to a distinctive periodicity [e.g. 1]."
