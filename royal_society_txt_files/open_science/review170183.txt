P2L44: “efficient [and effective biomechanical] systems..”
P5: P6L54: 30 second pause; in other words, this rotates in still fluid. Hummingbird wings don’t;
during hovering, they operate in an induced vertical flow of ~2m/s. Thus, while the kinematic
angle of attack may be ~ 30 degrees, the aerodynamic angle of attack is considerably less. This
may result in the observed flow characteristics, which seem markedly different from those
observed on hovering hummingbirds.
P7L47: If accurately re-created, the wing should be of variable spanwise chord geometry (i.e., a
lower kinematic angle with increasing distance from the wing root - so-called “washout”). Where
along the span was angle of attack measured? Further, does this wing have any camber? (The
illustrations suggest it does. Is it quantifiable? What would the true alpha at the leading edge
be?) Angle of attack measured as a line from leading to trailing edge doesn’t capture the true
presentation of a hummingbird wing, and I fear the flow characteristic observed may be a result
of an artificially high alpha. As the authors note, the force data clearly indicate a regular pattern
of vortex shedding at high angles of attack. Not only would this mechanism create poor lift/drag
ratios, on a wing likely far more elastic than their model, such periodicity, if routinely
experienced, might be produce undesirable mechanical effects (in terms of wear and tear). I think
it’s likely too high a frequency to induce aeroelastic flutter, but it seems somehow an inefficient
and unpleasant aerodynamic condition – and unlikely, particularly when compared to published
descriptions of the flow around real birds’ wings during hovering.
P10L6: Similar to model hawkmoth, but different from the flow around a real hummingbird
wing in flight. Can the authors comment?
P10L50: “…assess…” (Unless there’s another inference the authors are trying to make…)
P11,P1 end: I’d love to see this work done.
P16L52: Given this angle of attack is what is required for hovering, is there any justification for
inferring the unsteady, wholly separated/unsteady flows observed at 30 degrees as the primary
lift generating mechanism? More to the point of the second paper, I’m unsure that it’s reasonable
to assume these flow fields are typical of a fully feathered wing. At 17 degrees, the pattern of
force generation through translation lacks the periodic fluctuations resulting from the periodic
vortex shedding seen at high alpha, suggesting a very different type of flow around the wing. It
would be interesting and appropriate to compare the near-field flows at 17 degrees with those
reported for real, hovering hummingbirds. Do the authors have PIV data at 17 degrees?
P17L38: Assuming perfection is assuming a lot. The reference to Drosophila (54) isn’t truly
relevant; elastic energy storage in small insects is documented, but not so well supported in
vertebrates. I understand it’s a mathematical exercise, but a number more realistic than
perfection (that is, one that doesn’t violate the laws of thermodynamics; inertial power = zero)
would be welcome.
Overall, nice work, nicely presented. As far as the "annual cycle" study, I am a bit concerned
about the use of the flow data to represent the 'normal' wing.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In this article, the authors performed an experimental study of aerodynamics of the
hummingbird wing at hovering flight. Both flow measurement and force measurement were
done to investigate the unsteady flow around the revolving wing models that were attached to a
spinning axis. In general, their experiment and data collection appear to be well done, and the
result discussions were mostly adequate. I have a few comments for the authors to address
during revision.
1. In the Introduction, please clarify what “vorticity concentration” means.
2. In the study, the hummingbird wing model only performs a revolving motion and the
dynamic pitching is completely ignored. How does this simplification affect the study and
conclusion? This issue should be discussed.
3. Is the dry wing or a fabricated wing model being used in the flow measurement? It
doesn’t seem to be clear.
4. How is the wing kinematics, i.e., the acceleration/deceleration history, determined?
How much does it represent the real hummingbird wing?
5. The entire wing stroke was referred to “downstroke” in the description of the results. I
understand from the early discussion that it is meant to represent the downstroke of the
hummingbird only, but this is confusing, as one would naturally look for upstroke in the same
section.
6. Figure 4 caption: Please point out that z represents the spanwise location, and please
specify the angle of attack (AoA) in the figure (the AoA is also missing in other figures).
7. Figure 7: how is the standard deviation sigma_uv defined?
8. How different is the current study from previous ones that studied revolving wings of
hummingbird, such as
J. W. Kruyt, E. M. Quicazán-Rubio, G. F. Van Heijst, D. L. Altshuler, and D. Lentink.
Hummingbird wing efficacy depends on aspect ratio and compares with helicopter rotors.
Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 11(99), 2014.
What are the similarities and differences in the flow field and/or force measurement from those
studies?
9. In the discussion, the authors stated that no one has studied the drag characteristics of
hummingbird hovering. This is not true. They should check out this paper: Song, J., Luo, H.,
Hedrick, T.L. 2014 Three-dimensional flow and lift characteristics of a hovering Ruby-throated
hummingbird. Journal of the Royal Society Interface. 11(98), 20140541. That paper has studied
the time-dependent lift and drag characteristics in a wingbeat cycle, and they also discussed the
power consumption (their power requirement seems to be much lower than that estimated in the
present paper).
4
10. Their analysis of the entire wingbeat cycle is based on the assumption that the upstroke
is half of the downstroke. However, this assumption is not necessarily accurate may depend on
the species and perhaps the annual cycle that is the main focus of the current study. How
sensitive is their analysis to this assumption? This issue should be discussed.

This is a nicely presented and thorough analysis. My concerns remains: the wing was 'flown' at
an alpha unrepresentative of reality, and I would consider carefully how the story (and
subsequent moult story) would change if the angle of attack were lower and resulting flow field
were not so severely detached. While some LEV is inevitable, I remain skeptical of the reality of
this view, and, for that matter, the view of insect wings this study seems want to emulate.

Dear Mr Achache,
Our reviewer is generally happy with the presentation of your results, however, they have some
severe misgivings about whether any inferences of relevance to real wings can be made from
your model, which require a satisfactory response if we are to consider the manuscript further.
They have some suggestions to improve the manuscript, which are included below.
Kind regards,
Michael Doube
--------------------------
The real sticking point is this one: (From their response):
“We based our wing geometry on a scan of a real Calypte anna wing. Therefore, it is understood
that under the resolution of the scan the wing geometry is as in real-life, under no load. We do
not present the geometrical properties of the wing, such as local chord length, camber,
thickness,etc. since we believe it is out of the scope of the current study. We do not discuss each
geometrical aspect of the wing or analyse individual geometrical properties. We believe that the
reviewer is talking about the geometrical angle of the local airfoil with respect to the wing’s
tangential velocity (which is different than the local angle-of-attack). In case it is crucial, we can
provide several wing cross sections in the supplementary materials. The installation angle-of-
attack of the wing is defined as the wing’s root angle with respect to the hovering plane. It is an
arbitrary definition. Later, we mainly discuss our results using lift and torque rather than this
angle.”
I’m not sure how in a study of moult’s effects on a wing that the ‘geometrical properties of the
wing are beyond the scope of the study.’
The authors should explain what they mean by
“geometrical angle of the local airfoil with respect to the wing’s tangential velocity (which is
different than the local angle-of-attack).”
Do they mean to imply that that their angle of attack includes incident airflow and induced
downwash velocity in the incidence measurement?
In any case, I think the authors should explicitly describe the geometric angle of attack at the
wing root (stated as 30 degrees), and at the mid wing, and at the wing tip. It is indeed of crucial
importance if the wing model lacks typical variable incidence seen in a real bird wing; if the wing
tip is indeed geometrically presented at 30 degrees, its angle of attack, because it is moving much
11
faster than the root, would be far higher than at the root – which is why real wings all ‘washout’-
that is, are twisted to a lower geometric angle of incidence at the tip, resulting in a fairly constant
aerodynamic incidence angle from root to tip. Some of this washout in a bird wing may be
aeroelastic, which isn’t possible here.
At any rate, if the authors could explain their use of 30 degrees as the kinematic angle of attack at
the tip, when such an angle is not required to generate the needed lift, and forces the wing to ‘fly’
at a poor L/D, complete with high frequency vortex shedding, that would help. Yes, studies of
real birds indicate leading edge vorticity, but it’s confined to the leading edge, and the degree of
flow separation (esp. at the tip) seen here does not occur on real birds.

First round of reviewing

May 18, 2017
Dear editors of the journal Royal Society Open Science,
We thank you for your insightful review of our manuscript entitled ”Hovering hummingbird wing
aerodynamics during the annual cycle: I. Complete wing” (manuscript #RSOS-170183). We provide
below a detailed, point-by-point, response to the concerns of the reviewers. We hope that the updated
version of the manuscript is now suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Review 1
Comment 1: P2L44: efficient [and effective biomechanical] systems...
Response: The text has been changed as suggested by the reviewer, P2L44.
Comment 2: P5-P6L54: 30 second pause; in other words, this rotates in still fluid. Hummingbird
wings don’t; during hovering, they operate in an induced vertical flow of 2m/s. Thus, while the
kinematic angle of attack may be 30 degrees, the aerodynamic angle of attack is considerably less.
This may result in the observed flow characteristics, which seem markedly different from those observed
on hovering hummingbirds.
Response: It is natural that experimental and numerical methodologies have their limitations. The
art is to minimise their effect to the extent they are negligible to the effect under exploration.
Any flow in a closed tank is subject to the effect of the tank walls. In our experimental setup flow
is evolved below the hovering plane and at a given time from wing start, it impinges the tank wall (in
our case, the tank floor). Thereafter, reversal flow evolves (from the floor upwards). In order to avoid
this experimental artefact, only a single downstroke was created. During that single downstroke, no
reversal flow was measured. However, downwash evolved immediately with wing motion; This can
be nicely seen also in our results of the near-wake flow fields (Figure 4, panels A,D,G - v, denoted
by a blue background). The dimensionless downwash velocity close to the root of the wing (between
0 - 0.2R) ranges between -0.16 to -0.23. These values scale to ~ 2.4 [m/s] and ~ 3.5 [m/s] for
real hovering hummingbird wings, similar to the values measured by previous studies (e.g., [1, 2]) and
mentioned by the reviewer. Therefore, we believe that our experimental approach is sufficient for the
purpose of this study.
Comment 3: P7L47: If accurately re-created, the wing should be of variable spanwise chord geometry
(i.e., a lower kinematic angle with increasing distance from the wing root - so-called washout). Where
along the span was angle of attack measured? Further, does this wing have any camber? (The
illustrations suggest it does. Is it quantifiable? What would the true alpha at the leading edge be?)
Angle of attack measured as a line from leading to trailing edge doesn’t capture the true presentation
1
of a hummingbird wing, and I fear the flow characteristic observed may be a result of an artificially
high alpha. As the authors note, the force data clearly indicate a regular pattern of vortex shedding
at high angles of attack. Not only would this mechanism create poor lift/drag ratios, on a wing
likely far more elastic than their model, such periodicity, if routinely experienced, might be produce
undesirable mechanical effects (in terms of wear and tear). I think it’s likely too high a frequency to
induce aeroelastic flutter, but it seems somehow an inefficient and unpleasant aerodynamic condition
and unlikely, particularly when compared to published descriptions of the flow around real birds’ wings
during hovering.
Response: We based our wing geometry on a scan of a real Calypte anna wing. Therefore, it is
understood that under the resolution of the scan the wing geometry is as in real-life, under no load.
We do not present the geometrical properties of the wing, such as local chord length, camber, thickness,
etc. since we believe it is out of the scope of the current study. We do not discuss each geometrical
aspect of the wing or analyse individual geometrical properties. We believe that the reviewer is talking
about the geometrical angle of the local airfoil with respect to the wing’s tangential velocity (which
is different than the local angle-of-attack). In case it is crucial, we can provide several wing cross
sections in the supplementary materials. The installation angle-of-attack of the wing is defined as the
wing’s root angle with respect to the hovering plane. It is an arbitrary definition. Later, we mainly
discuss our results using lift and torque rather than this angle.
Regarding wear and tear, the wing was rigid enough [3, 4] and no aeroelastic flutter was captured
in our tests.
Flow pattens at Reynolds numbers of several ten thousand are characterised by vortex shedding.
These patterns were resolved over fixed wing geometries and revolving wings [3, 5]. These are the
key flow patterns that introduce flow instability and transition. These were captured over real hov-
ering birds, too [2], although such experiments are characterised by low signal-to-noise ratio due to
repeatability issues associated with tests over real-life animals.
Here we introduce high-definition experiments over a revolving wing (during the downstroke). Vortex
shedding is very clear and noticeable. However, since the wing accelerates, the vortex shedding evolves
on top of what we call a ’leading-edge bubble’. In this bubble, the flow separates and creates a low
pressure region, similar to the one that evolved within the LEV in much lower Reynolds numbers.
The difference between the two is that in the former, a vortex shedding evolves too, introducing more
time-scales to this flow field (or more frequencies). Since this evolution does not reach a steady state
(like the one over a steady translating wing), the aerodynamic characteristics remain fruitful (i.e.
high enough lift-to-torque ratio and noticeable lift). At the end of stroke, these vortices are being
convected thanks to the down-wash and a new leading-edge-bubble is being created. We hope that
this explanation is clear enough because this is our main finding in this study. We’ve also added this
explanation to the Conclusion section (See P18L53).
Comment 4: P10L6: Similar to model hawkmoth, but different from the flow around a real hum-
mingbird wing in flight. Can the authors comment?
Response: We agree with the reviewer comment that the hawkmoth reference in not relevant due to
the Reynolds number difference, and therefore removed from the paper .
Comment 5: P10L50: assess (Unless there’s another inference the authors are trying to make)
Response: The text was changed suggested (P9L36).
Comment 6: P16L52: Given this angle of attack is what is required for hovering, is there any
justification for inferring the unsteady, wholly separated/unsteady flows observed at 30 degrees as
the primary lift generating mechanism? More to the point of the second paper, I’m unsure that it’s
reasonable to assume these flow fields are typical of a fully feathered wing. At 17 degrees, the pattern of
force generation through translation lacks the periodic fluctuations resulting from the periodic vortex
shedding seen at high alpha, suggesting a very different type of flow around the wing. It would be
interesting and appropriate to compare the near-field flows at 17 degrees with those reported for real,
hovering hummingbirds. Do the authors have PIV data at 17 degrees?
2
Response: Hummingbirds change their wing angle relative to the hovering plane periodically [4].
For simplicity, in the current analysis the wing angle remained fixed during the downstroke. Design of
a mechanical system that fulfils the exact wing motion is highly complex, while we aimed to explore
the flow mechanisms for a given wing angle. Furthermore, the wing kinematics follow an initial
acceleration, steady rotation and deceleration stages. Steady rotation allowed us to maintain one
distinct Reynolds number rather than a variable one. We believe that these simplifications allowed
us to analyse coherently the basic flow mechanisms that evolved over the hovering wings and can be
efficiently used to analyse the wing during the moult process in comparison to the baseline wing. This
allowed us to analyse the main flow features, avoiding second order effects. In addition, we aim to
compare between the baseline wing and that during the moult process, and therefore analysed that
simplified wing kinematics.
Clearly, our results show a distinct difference between the aerodynamic characteristics at low and
high wing angles. At low wing angles (less than 20<U+25E6> ), the flow remain attached and no vortex shedding
is present. At high wing angles (more than 20<U+25E6> ), the flow detaches from the wing in the vicinity of
the leading edge and the flow becomes unsteady (as seen by the fluctuating aerodynamic loads).
The present aerodynamic loads results clearly indicate that most of the lift is generated at high wing
angles (Fig. 3); therefore we’ve decided to concentrate our PIV measurements at the highest relevant
wing angle (readily, 30<U+25E6> ) and not at lower angles, from the following reasons:
1. At low wing angles the flow is attached and the flow field does not show any newly discovered
features.
2. PIV is time and effort consuming technique. We decided to focus our efforts at high wing angles
after conducting qualitative flow visualisations at low wing angles.
In order to validate our simplified wing kinematics approach, we processed our time accurate results,
calculated time-averaged aerodynamic characteristics and then compared these with time-averaged
results found in the literature (e.g [4, 6, 7]). This comparison yields that hovering requires a time-
averaged wing angle of ~ 16.5<U+25E6> (see the average value found in [4], Fig. 4A), while the present results
estimate this time-averaged wing angle to be 17.4<U+25E6> . The text was changed accordingly for clarity
(P6L24).
Comment 7: P17L38: Assuming perfection is assuming a lot. The reference to Drosophila (54) isn’t
truly relevant; elastic energy storage in small insects is documented, but not so well supported in
vertebrates. I understand it’s a mathematical exercise, but a number more realistic than perfection
(that is, one that doesn’t violate the laws of thermodynamics; inertial power = zero) would be welcome.
Response: We thank you for this well-placed comment as indeed we were not sufficiently clear. In our
analysis, we’ve calculate the required power needed to maintain the wing motion. No assumptions of
perfect elastic storage were made. Then, we compared our results to previous studies which estimated
the power output in hummingbirds, in particular, Chai and Millard [8]. Due to the uncertainties
in hummingbirds’ ability to store energy, they have estimated two power output values; one where
prefect elastic storage is assumed and another where zero elastic storage is assumed. Our results seem
to correlate well with the result that is associated with perfect elastic storage. We changed the text
accordingly in order to present this clearly (P17L47).
Review 2
Comment 8: In the Introduction, please clarify what ”vorticity concentration” means.
Response: Since the definition of a vortex is somewhat under a debate in the scientific community, we
phrase ’vorticity concentration’ as a region of high spanwise vorticity, rather than defining a ’vortex’,
which has plenty of definitions in the literature.
Comment 9: In the study, the hummingbird wing model only performs a revolving motion and the
dynamic pitching is completely ignored. How does this simplification affect the study and conclusion?
This issue should be discussed.
3
Response: The subject of this study is the main state of the downstroke. It is true that the wing
rotation which takes place at both ends of the down and upstroke is not explored herein. This is
written in the text and is a subject of a future work. When the wing reaches each end of the stroke,
its tangential velocity approaches zero and so the relevant dynamic pressure and lift. In order to avoid
lift loss, circulation is evolved thanks to wing rotation that occurs during the wing reversal. In addition
to that, as noted before, the downwash convects the flow features, namely the ’leading-edge-bubble’
during this wing reversal. A preliminary study (unpublished) shows that at this Reynolds numbers,
a jet is created due to the wing reversal. We believe that this feature augment lift and will improve
the entire wing beat characteristics. We added a sentence in the text that advise the potential reader
about this effect P3L37.
Comment 10: Is the dry wing or a fabricated wing model being used in the flow measurement? It
doesn’t seem to be clear..
Response: In all experiments, both loads measurements and flow field, the same fabricated wings
were used. The wings were 3D printed using stereo lithography as described in pg. 3 in the manuscript.
We’ve changed the text for clarity (P6L18).
Comment 11: How is the wing kinematics, i.e., the acceleration/deceleration history, determined?
How much does it represent the real hummingbird wing?
Response: The wing kinematics follow an initial acceleration, steady rotation and deceleration stages.
Steady rotation allowed us to maintain one distinct Reynolds number rather than a variable one. We
believe that these simplifications allowed us to analyse coherently the basic flow mechanisms that
evolved over the hovering wings and can be efficiently used to analyse the wing during the moult
process in comparison to the baseline wing.
Comment 12: The entire wing stroke was referred to ”downstroke” in the description of the results. I
understand from the early discussion that it is meant to represent the downstroke of the hummingbird
only, but this is confusing, as one would naturally look for upstroke in the same section.
Response: The entire manuscript was revised such that ’downstroke’ is the only term used when
describing the power stroke, ’upstroke’ describes the recovery stroke and ’wingbeat’ refers to the
downstroke and upstroke motion.
Comment 13: Figure 4 caption: Please point out that z represents the spanwise location, and please
specify the angle of attack (AoA) in the figure (the AoA is also missing in other figures).
Response: Thank you. We’ve updated all captions accordingly.
Comment 14: Figure 7: how is the standard deviation suv defined?
Response: The general definition of the standard deviation used in our manuscript is
 
1 02  12
su1 u2 = u + u2 02 (1)
2 1
where, u1 and u2 are the two components of the vector field. A detailed description can be found in
pg. 6 starting from line 49 of our manuscript.
Comment 15: How different is the current study from previous ones that studied revolving wings of
hummingbird, such as reference [6]. What are the similarities and differences in the flow field and/or
force measurement from those studies?
4
Response: The key features that distinct our work from other are divided to several aspects:
Flow mechanisms
1. We analyse a single downstroke rather than steady rotating wing. We believe that the resulting
flow mechanisms are different and yield higher lift production.
2. Our high fidelity techniques and the large set of results allowed us to resolve a unique flow feature
- the ’leading edge bubble’, which is the flow structure at Reynolds number ten thousand that
resembles the ’leading edge vortex’ that characterised the flow over flapping wings at Reynolds
number of several hundred. Noticeable vortex shedding evolve from the leading edge bubble,
although the flow field yields high lift production.
Techniques and methodology
1. High fidelity flow measurements (spatial and temporal) that depict the flow field along the
downstroke, yielding phase-avegared results and standard deviation.
2. Time-accurate force and torque measurement that are associated with the flow measurements
along the downstroke.
3. accurate wing geometry, which is based on a scan of a dried hummingbird wing.
4. Our results present a comprehensive picture of the flow field, integral aerodynamic characteristics
and energetics.
Comment 16: In the discussion, the authors stated that no one has studied the drag characteristics of
hummingbird hovering. This is not true. They should check out this paper: Song, J., Luo, H., Hedrick,
T.L. 2014 Three-dimensional flow and lift characteristics of a hovering Ruby-throated hummingbird.
Journal of the Royal Society Interface. 11(98), 20140541. That paper has studied the time-dependent
lift and drag characteristics in a wingbeat cycle, and they also discussed the power consumption (their
power requirement seems to be much lower than that estimated in the present paper).
Response: We thank the reviewer for his comment and added the provided paper to our manuscript.
This study numerically verified that the aerodynamic characteristics ratio between the downstroke
and upstroke is at a spectrum between 1.8 - 2.85. This spectrum is similar to the spectrum we have
assumed in our analysis (we used the spectrum between 2 - 3), as already reported in the manuscript
(e.g. [2]). All our analysis is presented in this spectrum and reflects the uncertainty of this parameter.
Comment 17: Their analysis of the entire wingbeat cycle is based on the assumption that the
upstroke is half of the downstroke. However, this assumption is not necessarily accurate may depend
on the species and perhaps the annual cycle that is the main focus of the current study. How sensitive
is their analysis to this assumption? This issue should be discussed.
Response: We based our assumption on previous findings from Annas hummingbirds and other
hummingbirds, which showed that the strokes times are equal (eg. [6, 7]) or very similar to equal (e.g.,
48% downstroke [4]). The following figure demonstrates the sensitivity of C L (the downstroke average
lift coefficient required for hover flight) for each case of tested h (the downstroke contribution to the
overall lift of the wingbeat). As can be seen, small differences have very little effect on the required
time-averaged lift coefficient, C L , which differs by only 1.5% from the case of 50:50 percent ratio.
Therefore, we believe that the uncertainty introduced by this ratio is of a second order importance.
In the sake of brevity and clearness of the text we think it is better not to discuss this uncertainty in
detail but we added a text that introduce this sensitivity analysis in our discussion (P16L51).

Responses to Review Comments on
“Hovering hummingbird wing aerodynamics during the annual cycle:
I. Complete wing”
Second round of reviewing
Yonathan Achache Nir Sapir Yossef Elimelech
July 14, 2017
Dear editors of the Royal Society Open Science journal,
Thank you for reviewing our revised manuscript entitled ”Hovering hummingbird wing aerodynamics
during the annual cycle: I. Complete wing” (manuscript #RSOS-170183). We provide below a detailed
response to the comments. We further changed and updated the manuscript as needed to address the
concerns of the reviewers. We hope that this updated version of the manuscript is now suitable for
publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Review 1
To clearly answer the reviwer’s concerns, we broke-down his review into separated comments.
Comment 1: The real sticking point is this one (from their response):
”We based our wing geometry on a scan of a real Calypte anna wing. Therefore, it is understood that
under the resolution of the scan the wing geometry is as in real-life, under no load. We do not present
the geometrical properties of the wing, such as local chord length, camber, thickness,etc. since we
believe it is out of the scope of the current study. We do not discuss each geometrical aspect of the
wing or analyse individual geometrical properties. We believe that the reviewer is talking about the
geometrical angle of the local airfoil with respect to the wings tangential velocity (which is different
than the local angle-of-attack). In case it is crucial, we can provide several wing cross sections in the
supplementary materials. The installation angle-of-attack of the wing is. It is an arbitrary definition.
Later, we mainly discuss our results using lift and torque rather than this angle.”
I’m not sure how in a study of moult’s effects on a wing that the geometrical properties of the wing
are beyond the scope of the study.
Response: Here is a clarification of our previous answer. A wing of the Calypte anna was scanned
and yielded a high fidelity three-dimensional CAD model. We added a reference to a previous study
(figure 1, adapted from Elimelech and Ellington, 2013) that discusses the wing geometry, few cross
sections and a description. We also added a PDF file contacting additional views to our complementary
materials in order to stress the unique features of the wing geometry. We treat the wing as-is. The
geometry is very important but we meant to explain that the aerodynamic characteristics were not
explored for each geometric feature. We did not check the sensitivity of the aerodynamic characteristics
for each geometrical property. We hope it is clear now.
Comment 2: The authors should explain what they mean by ”geometrical angle of the local airfoil
with respect to the wings tangential velocity (which is different than the local angle-of-attack).”
1
Do they mean to imply that that their angle of attack includes incident airflow and induced downwash
velocity in the incidence measurement?
Response: We define angle of attack as the physical angle between the wing’s root chord and the
horizontal plane, as presented in figure 1C. This angle is provided as a reference only at the wing root.
It is a pure geometric feature and does not include induced downwash velocity. The manuscript was
revised and changed accordingly to clearly state that (see page 5 line 52).
Comment 3: In any case, I think the authors should explicitly describe the geometric angle of attack
at the wing root (stated as 30 degrees), and at the mid wing, and at the wing tip. It is indeed of crucial
importance if the wing model lacks typical variable incidence seen in a real bird wing; if the wing tip is
indeed geometrically presented at 30 degrees, its angle of attack, because it is moving much faster than
the root, would be far higher than at the root which is why real wings all washout- that is, are twisted
to a lower geometric angle of incidence at the tip, resulting in a fairly constant aerodynamic incidence
angle from root to tip. Some of this washout in a bird wing may be aeroelastic, which isnt possible here.
Response: Sections of the wing model are presented here (Elimelech and Ellington, 2013, figure
1). Chord, twist and airfoil shape are apparent and clear. Near-tip sections are less cambered, have
smaller thickness ratio and are twisted relative to root wing sections.
Unlike most other bird species, hummingbird wings are rigid throughout the downstroke (Tobalske
et al., 2007). There is hardly any change in the wingspan length in hover (especially during the
downstroke). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements of Calypte anna’s wing have also
revealed a physical connection between neighbouring barbs (Elimelech and Ellington, 2013). Therefore,
based on previous reports (e.g, Tanaka et al., 2013) and personal observation (e.g, Sapir and Dudley,
2012), it is assumed that during the downstroke, wing deformation is minimal and does not play a
significant role, as opposed to the upstroke and wing reversal. This allowed us to use the scanned
wing as a physical wing model that accurately reflects the wing geometry during the downstroke.
Figure 1: Hummingbird wing model planform and representative cross-sections. The cross-sections
are shown at an angle of attack of the wing of 0<U+25E6> (adapted from Elimelech and Ellington, 2013)
.
Comment 4: At any rate, if the authors could explain their use of 30 degrees as the kinematic angle
of attack at the tip, when such an angle is not required to generate the needed lift, and forces the wing
to ’fly’ at a poor L/D, complete with high frequency vortex shedding, that would help. Yes, studies of
real birds indicate leading edge vorticity, but its confined to the leading edge, and the degree of flow
separation (esp. at the tip) seen here does not occur on real birds.
2
Response: We do not suggest that hummingbirds flap their wings at a = 30<U+25E6> throughout the entire
downstroke. Rather, we suggest, based on empirical findings (Tobalske et al., 2007, Hedrick et al.,
2012, Read et al., 2016, Kruyt et al., 2015, 2014, Warrick et al., 2005), that the birds regularly
operate at these high angles during the downstroke in real life situations, but not throughout the
entire downstroke. Our specific choice of a = 30<U+25E6> is detailed below in our response to comment no.
6. Furthermore, in our manuscript, we provide a detailed analysis (L/D, Power factor, etc.) for
wide spectrum of angles of attack based on our time-accurate aerodynamic loads measurements (see
Hovering performance, pages 16-18).
Comment 5: Yes, studies of real birds indicate leading edge vorticity, but its confined to the leading
edge, and the degree of flow separation (esp. at the tip) seen here does not occur on real birds.
Response: Previous studies, which describe the phase-averaged flow field over different section of a
hummginmbird wing, measured similar flow fields - including the large separation, due to leading-edge
vorticity, from the wing surface (see figure 1A in Kruyt et al., 2015, figure 4 in Kruyt et al., 2014
and figures 6A,B and C in our manuscript). As discussed in the previous response letter, one of the
novelties of our analysis is the high spatial resolution and time-accurate flow fields and how they evolve
along the downstroke. This allowed us to analyse the unsteady nature of the flow field mechanisms
and the nature of the ’leading-edge bubble’ (see Flow structures, pages 14-16). These results were
correlated to the time-accurate aerodynamic load measurements using spectral (time-accurate loads)
and modal (PIV results) analysis. We see the ’leading-edge bubble’ as a ’natural’ result based on what
the scientific community knows about the leading-edge vortex at Reynolds numbers of few hundreds
and the flow features at Reynolds numbers of several hundred thousand. In the lower Reynolds number
regime, a coherent and stable leading-edge vortex exist. In the upper end, transition develops, starting
at very low angles of attack (Elimelech and Ellington, 2013, Elimelech et al., 2013). The ’leading edge
bubble’ is characterised by a large leading-edge separation, while, the flow within the bubble becomes
unsteady featuring shedding of vorticity concentrations as presented in our analysis.
Review 2
Comment 6: This is a nicely presented and thorough analysis. My concerns remains: the wing
was ’flown’ at an alpha unrepresentative of reality, and I would consider carefully how the story (and
subsequent moult story) would change if the angle of attack were lower and resulting flow field were
not so severely detached. While some LEV is inevitable, I remain skeptical of the reality of this view,
and, for that matter, the view of insect wings this study seems want to emulate.
Response: Our analysis is composed from detailed time-accurate aerodynamic loads measurements
and PIV analysis. As noted before, PIV could not be undertaken at the same fidelity, i.e. at each angle
of attack in which the loads measurements were acquired. Following our analysis of the time-accurate
lift measurements (Fig. 2), different aerodynamic time evolution is clearly seen between those at low
angles of attack (i.e., 5<U+25E6> = a = 30<U+25E6> ) and at higher ones (a = 20<U+25E6> ). At the lower range, damped
oscillations appear (Pattern 1), in contrast to the higher frequency oscillations persisting throughout
most of the downstroke at the higher range of angles of attack (Pattern 2).
We aimed to analyse the unique flow features at the Calypte anna’s operational angles of attack
but wanted to get a coherent description of the flow field. For this reason, we acquired PIV data at
an angle of attack of 30<U+25E6> . According to previous studies, such angle of attack is at the higher end
of the Calypte anna operational angle of attacks (Tobalske et al., 2007, Hedrick et al., 2012, Read
et al., 2016, Kruyt et al., 2015, 2014, Warrick et al., 2005). Undertaking PIV data at lower angle of
attack would result in flow fields which are characterised by both flow features of low and high angles
of attack; we tried to avoid acquiring these incoherent flow fields. Moreover, the flow field at a = 30<U+25E6>
is a qualitative measure to the flow field at lower angles of attack (up to a = 20<U+25E6> ) as indicated by
Pattern 2 in the time-accurate lift measurements. In a future work, we intend to realise a variable
angle of attack along the downstroke; in our current first attempt the flow field measurements and
3

angular position.
their correlation to load measurements helped us to imply that similar flow mechanisms govern the
flow field at a = 20<U+25E6> and a = 30<U+25E6> .
We would like to emphasise that this study is not at the operational Reynolds numbers of insects.
Previous reports have indicated about massive flow separation and loss of leading-edge vortex co-
herency over accelerating wing models as early as Re = 1000 (Elimelech et al., 2013, Kolomenskiy
et al., 2014) and fixed hummingbird wing model (Re = 5000, Elimelech and Ellington, 2013).
We changed the text to include this explanation (see page 6 line 27 and page 9 line 29). We hope
that our genuine efforts made this aspect clear enough.
