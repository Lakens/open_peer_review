The paper is well written and the new developed pump is very well described. However, it is
highly recommended to:
-make a table at the discussion section to comper your achievements with what you presented in
the literature as being shortcommings of current products.
-also, every pump needs good reliability. A discussion about the life of the pump and any
efficiency changes during the life time will help the reader highly.

The authors presented a simple yet innovative micropump. This is a nice idea for creating
disposable microfluidics. They developed the idea based on a superabsorbent polymerfreeze-
dried material. The material absorbed the liquid in the flow channel and initiates pumping by
swelling. They showed that the rate of absorption remained relatively constant and was a
function of the characteristic of the absorbent material. The also presented the electrical signal
response for switching valve that turns on the pump.
I support the publication of this work with just a few minor comments:
1- That the authors mention liquid metal based pumps which are also very low cost (PNAS 111,
3304, 2014, and Nature Comm 7, 12402, 2016)

2- I strongly suggest that, if it is allowed by the journal, the authors include several of the videos
that show the performance of the pump in action

• Competing interests
Please declare any financial or non-financial competing interests, or state that you have no
competing interests.
• Authors’ contributions
All submissions, other than those with a single author, must include an Authors’ Contributions
section which individually lists the specific contribution of each author. The list of Authors
should meet all of the following criteria; 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, or
acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it
critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published.
All contributors who do not meet all of these criteria should be included in the
acknowledgements.
We suggest the following format:
AB carried out the molecular lab work, participated in data analysis, carried out sequence
alignments, participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript; CD carried out
the statistical analyses; EF collected field data; GH conceived of the study, designed the study,
coordinated the study and helped draft the manuscript. All authors gave final approval for
publication.
• Acknowledgements
Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship
criteria.
• Funding statement
Please list the source of funding for each author.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.

now accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
You can expect to receive a proof of your article in the near future. Please contact the editorial
office (openscience_proofs@royalsociety.org and openscience@royalsociety.org) to let us know if

Response to the referees
We really appreciate the referees who reviewed our manuscript carefully
spending their precious time for us. The points raised by the referees have been
checked carefully and the corresponding portions have been revised. The
manuscript file with revised portions highlighted in blue (and underlined) has
been uploaded as Supporting Information for Review Only.
Referee: 1
The paper is well written and the new developed pump is very well described.
<U+2192> We thank the referee for his/her comment.
However, it is highly recommended to:
-make a table at the discussion section to comper your achievements with what
you presented in the literature as being shortcommings of current products.
<U+2192> We thank the referee for his/her advice. We have added a comment at the
corresponding portion (page 4, section 4.2, line 42-43) and added a table with
information regarding the problems with current passive pumps and
improvements realized by our pump (page 4, at the end of section 4.2).
-also, every pump needs good reliability. A discussion about the life of the pump
and any efficiency changes during the life time will help the reader highly.
<U+2192> We thank the referee for his/her comment. An excellent property of
our pump is its stability for long-term storage. The SAP discs could be
stored for more than one month in an air-tight container maintaining the
initial performance as freshly prepared ones. On the other hand, Ac and
Ar decreased by approximately 10% when the discs were stored in the
open-air condition at room temperature for 30 days. Even in this case, the
deterioration of the performance was not significant. The result indicates
1
that the SAP pumps can be used reproducibly if they are stored properly.
We have added a comment (page 4, section 4.2, line 37-41).

<U+2192> We thank the referee for his/her advice. We have additionally cited those
two papers in the introduction with comments. (page 5, section 4.3, line 19-22).
2- I strongly suggest that, if it is allowed by the journal, the authors include
several of the videos that show the performance of the pump in action
<U+2192> We thank the referee for his/her advice. We have added four movies to show
the operation of our pump. The information about the movies has been added
as follows
Supporting movie 1 <U+2192> Section 3.5, page 3, line 29
Supporting movie 2 <U+2192> Section 4.2, page 4, line 27
