The paper “The Dynamics of Emotions in Online Interactions” presents three studies that
examine emotional dynamics after reading or producing content in an online discussion forum.
The studies examine changes in valence and arousal from self-report measures, finding evidence
for, among other things, 1) a relaxation towards baseline 2) changes in valence that are dependent
on the content of the discussion, and 3) when producing posts for an online discussion arousal
decreases as part of a regulation mechanism.
I was excited to read this paper as I think the topic is important and the approach the authors
were taking was interesting. There is indeed much to like about the paper. It takes on important
questions at the micro level of emotion rather than more global questions, which is more typical.
In particular, the dynamic temporal nature of these analyses is valuable. The statistical analyses
were sophisticated and the figures were clear.
Unfortunately, I have two concerns that undermine the contribution of the paper, one a
methodological issue and the other a framing issue.
The most important concern is that all of the data in the study, across the 3 experiments, are all
based on a single-item measure: a Likert-scale item from 1-7 that the authors transform in to
valence and arousal values. First, the transformation is not made clear, but more importantly,
most (perhaps all) theories of emotion posit two distinct dimensions of emotions, as does the
current paper. For example, Russell’s single-item measure of emotion (1989) involved a two
dimensional grid that could capture both dimensions. More generally, single-item measures tend
to be viewed skeptically given their poor psychometric qualities. Given the very sophisticated
statistics used here, I am concerned that the quality of the underlying data is not sufficient to be
reliable for these analyses. For me to be able to recommend this paper, I would need to be
convinced that this kind of single-item measure for a multi-dimensional construct is sufficiently
reliable to support these analyses, either from citations in the literature or gathering new data
with more appropriate measures. Otherwise, its really not possible to make reasonable
conclusions from the analyses.The same holds for the likelihood to participate - while this is
likely a single dimension, its hard to tell since there is only one item, the general psychometric
weakness of a single-item measure applies.
The second issue is the framing of the study as modeling the dynamics of emotions in online
interactions. While this is descriptive of the stimuli, the current model and empirical test make no
indication of how this is different from any other stimulus. For instance, is there something
special about reading some content in an online discussion forum, than say, a newspaper, or a
diary, or a novel? What is it that is unique to the online context that suggests that this model and
these data are specific to the dynamics of online interaction? This criticism is obvious for studies 1
and 2 given that there is no interaction either, but for study 3 I think the authors could make a
good case. The participants did in fact interact with the context and provided their own
messages. To me, this interactivity is an important feature of the online environment, though not
the only one. The paper fails to indicate why this is about online interaction and not a more
general model (which might be fine to articulate).
If these issues can be resolved, I would be happy to review a revision and provide more detailed,
lower-level comments.

Introduction
I read the Introduction more than once yet remained unclear about the research framework on
which this article is based; the reader is not led from the general to the specific. You refer to
studies of collective phenomena yet do not situate you research within a specific theory i.e.
identification, suggestibility, the uncanny, patterning of affective practice, are some that have
been proposed by other researchers ( you do mention emotional contagion, briefly). Yet at l51 p1
you imply that an agent is capable of 'unifying different models of social interaction'.
Identification during online social interaction online has been extensively researched and is likely
to influence the dialogue on which your study is based ( inferred from thread message example
supplied in S1). Similarly Wetherell's proposal in Affect and Emotion to study the patterning of
affect has synergy with your intention to study the dynamics of online interaction. Am I correct in
assuming that you are referring to excitability as a general emotion. Otherwise I cannot
understand how forum participants can share a collective emotion given the topic covered in the
example message.
Emotional agents model
I note that in the Discussion you describe the Cybermotions framework as based on assumptions.
This needs to be made clear from the outset also, what is the rationale behind these assumptions?
Some current work has incorporated a dominance dimension alongside valence and amplitude so
you need to explain in more detail why you have not taken individual differences in emotional
resilience into account.

Results
Figure 3 would be more convincing if you had used an an average of all participants
Discussion
By using an agent and an experimental paradigm you claim that most of the ethical concerns
related to studying online social interaction are circumvented. However, what you now have is a
first person social interaction for Studies 1 & 2 and is a limitation that should be mentioned. Also,
could you provide some detail about the ethical guidelines you used when sourcing the threads
and also for ensuring the wellbeing of your participants.
Finally, although you sourced the conversation from an online discussion you do not make any
reference to what is unique about this particular medium for of interpersonal communication -
there is an extensive research literature in related disciplines for example, Communication,

The authors have improved this submission significantly. However, a major problem remains;
the assumption that the processes that result in shared emotions online are synonymous with
those experienced face-to-face (as expressed at line 14 of the Introduction). There has been
considerable debate and associated research on the relational implications of mediated
communication and the findings that have relevance for the design of the Cyberemotions
modelling framework should be addressed. There is a related issue. The date of publication for
reference 33, included as an example of online identification, is 1978 which predates the
opportunity to communicate with others through forums and other social media by several years.
The report is focused on collective emotions. The new material in the Introduction focuses on
group emotions. The psychology of group interpersonal relations does not necessarily translate to
collective emotions.
The discussion topic as illustrated by one message (S1) appears to be emotive and is why the
ethical criteria were requested. The report claims to be following the emotional valence and
arousal of the interaction as it evolves. Indeed it is a significant advantage of the approach.
However, the account of the ethics in Section 5a implies that the discussion thread was
manipulated in some way – see lines 15,16 - that in fact participants did not interact with the
discussion as it evolved.

This article reports a very interesting project. It aims at reducing the emotional aspects of on-line
interactions to basics so as to efficiently test assumptions about the dynamics of emotions in
social interactions on the Internet networks. The project raises a major concern of current research
on emotion and communication across social networks. It offers a convincing demonstration of
the usefulness of the proposed method and concepts. However, this innovative project brings to
the floor a number of concepts that readers who study emotions are unfamiliar with. In many
places, the text of the article would deserve to be clearer or more explicit in order to avoid losing
precisely the readership that might benefit from it.
- the notion of "models of individual emotion dynamics" is introduced with a list of
examples (p. 3, "cellular automata", "bifurcations in dynamical systems", "Brownian motion"). The
reader might appreciate being explained the concept in some details.
- A bit further in the text comes the "Cyberemotions modeling framework". In the sentence
that follows, it is said that this framework "allows the creation of models of user emotions etc."
But besides this definition by the use, nothing is said of what "Cyerberemotions framework"
means and represents, where it comes from and so forth
The model that is at the core of the paper is described under the title 2 "Emotional agents model".
I had a hard time to go through it and to figure out exactly what the variables were. As far as
possible, I would prefer reading first a detailed and clarified exposure of the variables in the
model and their interrelations, followed in a later step by the set of equation formalizing them. As
an illustration of the difficulties I met, "expression s" is first mentioned in the legend of Figure 1.
It is only later on p. 4 that the notion of "expression" shows up in the text supposed to describe
(articulate!) the model. And it is lost in a sentence stating that "the dynamics of the perceived
emotional content (…) are influenced by the emotional content of the expression of the agents,
si(t)". The notion of "expression rules" emerges a number of times in the article but as far as I have
seen, it is never introduced or defined.
As regards the Methods, I regretted that the methods section took place only at the end of the
paper. But this might be a specific requirement of the journal. In any case, it is impossible to go
through the Results and Discussion sections without a minimal knowledge of what was done in
study 1, 2 and 3. So, this minimal information could be sketched before the beginning of Section
3.
The reader might want to know the context of the studies (what was said to participants?).
Information available about studies 1 and 2 is really minimal, and virtually absent for study 3—
which should certainly be corrected.
In conclusion, I am clearly in favor of the publication of this innovative and promising work. But
I believe that the text of the paper needs to be clarified and complemented in a good deal of
respect.

The extended experimental design section has clarified most of the issues previously raised.
However, the references to group identification remain a concern specifically, that the
identification differences between face-to-face and mediated communication in the context of ‘the
group’ have not yet been addressed. Also, I note the frequent use of the qualifier ‘likely’ when
describing group processes and that there is no discussion of the implication of the findings from
the research for group processes. The context described for the submission is an open discussion
forum involving large numbers of people and the collective emotions that ensue. Why is
13
reference to ‘the group’ relevant? My preference would be for all reference to group identification
to be omitted from the Introduction.

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The extended experimental design section has clarified most of the issues previously raised.
However, the references to group identification remain a concern specifically, that the
identification differences between face-to-face and mediated communication in the context of ‘the
group’ have not yet been addressed. Also, I note the frequent use of the qualifier ‘likely’ when
describing group processes and that there is no discussion of the implication of the findings from
the research for group processes. The context described for the submission is an open discussion
forum involving large numbers of people and the collective emotions that ensue. Why is
reference to ‘the group’ relevant? My preference would be for all reference to group identification
to be omitted from the Introduction.

See Appendix C.
Appendix A
Dear editorial office of Royal Society Open Science,
We submit a new version of our original submission, taking into account the
comments by the reviewers:
- Both reviewers suggested to focus on the interactivity of the experimental
setup to differentiate it from previous communication studies. We are very
grateful for these suggestions, which motivated the most significant addition
in this resubmission. We analyzed how emotions trigger the expression of
positivity and negativity, as measured by the expression function in the agent
based model. Section 5c explains the methods and Section 3bii includes our new
results: Two different sentiment analysis techniques show that positive and
negative expression through text are strongly dependent on valence, while
generally independent on arousal, one of the assumptions of the agent-based
model of Schweitzer and Garcia (2010). We summarized this new important part
of the article in the abstract:
"When participating in an online discussion, the content of participants'
expression depends on their valence, and their arousal significantly
decreases afterwards as a regulation mechanism. We illustrate how these
results allow the design of agent-based models to reproduce and analyze
emotions in online communities. Our work empirically validates the
microdynamics of a model of online collective emotions, bridging online data
analysis with research in the laboratory."
- Reviewer 1 raised the question of the methods used for measuring emotions
based on Likert scales. We extended our explanation for the choice of Likert
scales in Section 5a:
"After reading the posts of a thread, participants provided subjective reports of their
emotions on three 7-point Likert scales to assess the subjective emotional response.
With view towards the requirements of the repeated measurement situation (10
threads), we aimed to obtain sufficiently reliable measures while the relatively weak
and fleeting emotional states that can be elicited by forum posts could still be
expected to be present. For this purpose, e.g., even the two relatively short 10-item
scales of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS, [63]) would have been
too long and not sufficiently focused on the immediate emotional response to an
individual emotional stimulus such as a forum thread. Instead, our measurement
situation was much more comparable to experimental designs assessing emotional
responses to emotional images, sounds, or words in the laboratory [64,65]. These types
of designs typically measure valence, arousal, and sometimes dominance (power)
via single-item graphical scales such as the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) [66].
Single-item Likert-type measures, if well phrased and designed, are not necessarily
worse than multiple-item scales [67]. For example the SAM has been the basis for
the validation of the extremely well cited International Affective Picture System
(IAPS) [68]. However, the graphical version of the SAM requires some additional
instructions and explanations that are, ideally, delivered by an experimenter who can
respond to questions. In addition, valence has recently been increasingly discussed as
a potentially two-dimensional construct allowing co-activation of both positive and
negative feeling states, such as in the case of bittersweet mixed emotions [69]."
And discussed the possible multidimensional extensions in the conclusion:
"The present research required very brief measures to avoid subject
fatigue and dissipation of the emotional impact of having read the short
threads, which limited the number of items that could be posed repeatedly.
Compared to single-item Likert-scales, a two-dimensional single-item measure
such as the Affect Grid [54] could have been even briefer, once sufficiently
explained. However, this type of measure still faces conceptual issues [55],
and specifically the good validity of the Affect Grid reported by the original
authors [54] has been found to be only moderate by subsequent research [56]."
- Following the comments by the reviewer 1, we added a detailed explanation
on how and why we compute valence from the participant responses:
"However, no systematic evidence for mixed-valence emotions was observed.
Cronbach's alpha=.88 across all positive and the inverse of all negative
valence judgments suggested sufficient overlap between both items to justify
integration of both scales into a single measure by subtracting the value of
negative affect from the value of positive affect and mapping the result to
the scale of [-1,1]."
- Reviewer 2 suggested a series of improvements to the introduction and the
explanation of emotional agents. Following those comments, we improved the
review of previous works and the framing of our approach in the introduction:
"Intergroup emotions theory, based on appraisal theory [1–3] and the social
identity perspective [4] suggests that dynamic variability of emotions over
time can be found not only at the individual level but also at the level of
group emotions [5]. More specifically, emotional experience has been found to
elicit the social sharing of emotion in the construction of emotional climates
[6,7], via processes that are likely to involve group identification [8],
emotion contagion [9], conformity with group norms [4], and social or group-
based regulation of emotion [5,10] to name only a few. It is likely that such
processes are not limited to face-to-face encounters, in particular since many
of the sources of over-time variability of group-based emotion may be at least
partially of an informational nature [5]. Participatory online communities,
such as social networking sites or discussion fora, provide a thriving medium
for the emergence of such collective emotional phenomena."
"Agent-based models can provide new insights into social psychology [8],
unifying different models of social interaction into a comprehensive
computational representation of emotions that can encompass a variety of
aspects, including identification during online social interaction [32,33],
changes in self- categorization as a group member [34], emotional contagion
[9,23], as well as affective- discoursive patterns that may help to reconnect
discourse studies with novel research on affect and emotion [35]. Towards this
aim, the modeling in the present paper will be based on the valence and
arousal circumplex of core affect [36–38]. This view is not specific to
emotion, but provides some grounding to the application of our techniques in
social psychology. Regarding emotional dynamics, some works within
mathematical psychology provide support for the usefulness of using agent-
based modeling in such contexts [39]."
- Reviewer 2 suggested that we show averaged dynamics on Figure 3. We did not
show an average on Figure 3 because our point is to illustrate individual
dynamics, not to show again the results of the regression methods. We
clarified this point by adding the following text to the explanation of the
figure:
"This illustrates the dynamics of an individual, rather than analyzing the
average response as shown in the regression results of Table 2."
- Following the comments by reviewer 2, we improved the explanation of the
ethical guidelines followed in our experiments:
"Conforming with standard ethical guidelines, participation in all three of
the above studies was entirely voluntary, and participants were informed that
they could quit participating in the study at any point in time without any
negative consequences. Participants provided informed consent at the beginning
of a study, and all participants were fully debriefed at the end of each of
the studies in this research. Furthermore, to avoid any negative impact on
participant's emotional well-being during or after taking part in the study,
the study design provided a balancing positive emotional stimulus for each
negative stimulus that was presented, thus preventing any buildup of negative
emotional states. In the laboratory studies, participants were furthermore
given the opportunity to ask questions to the experimenter who ensured that
there were no potentially lingering negative effects of the negative forum
threads at the end of the study."
We are very thankful to both reviewers and the editorial team for their time
and effort reviewing our submission. We commend this paper to you, and look
forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience,
Yours Faithfully,
David Garcia, on behalf of all authors.
Appendix B
The dynamics of emotions under online interaction
Response to Referees
David Garcia, Arvid Kappas, Dennis Küster, Frank Schweitzer
We thank reviewers for their input. In the following, we explain
how we have assessed all the comments and suggestions of the reviewers:

We thank the suggestion of the reviewer, who points at the necessity to
develop more the link between face-to-face emotional interaction and our case
of study. To clarify the similarities without imposing an equivalence between
processes, we comment in the new introduction:
"It is likely that such processes are not limited to face-to-face encounters,
in particular since many of the sources of over-time variability of group-based
emotions [5] and collective emotions [6] may be at least partially of an
informational nature."
> There is a related issue. The date of publication for reference 33, included
> as an example of online identification, is 1978 which predates the
> opportunity to communicate with others through forums and other social media
> by several years.
Our previous citation to that reference contained an unnecessary context of
online interaction. To clarify the issue the reviewer mentions, we rewrote the
mentioned sentence:
"... including identification processes [34] that can take place during online social interaction [35] ..."
> The report is focused on collective emotions. The new material in the
> Introduction focuses on group emotions. The psychology of group
> interpersonal relations does not necessarily translate to collective
> emotions.
In the current version of the article, we identify the line between collective
emotions and group emotions, citing seminal works on the relationship between
both. To make this point clear, we rewrote part of the second paragraph of the
introduction:
"Collective emotions are defined as states of an community in which a large
number of individuals share one or more emotional states [6,11]. While the
differences between face-to-face and online interaction are evident,
collective emotions can also emerge in online communities [12,13], a topic
that is receiving rising attention in the literature (see chapters 25 to 28 of
[13]). In the field, collective emotions can be found frequently in online
communities, including spontaneous fights in political fora [14], the
spreading of Internet memes [15] and political movements [16], or user-
generated content on YouTube that may, under certain circumstances, become
viral through the excitement of thousands of users [17,18]."
> The discussion topic as illustrated by one message (S1) appears to be
> emotive and is why the ethical criteria were requested. The report claims
> to be following the emotional valence and arousal of the interaction as it
> evolves. Indeed it is a significant advantage of the approach. However, the
> account of the ethics in Section 5a implies that the discussion thread was
> manipulated in some way – see lines 15,16 - that in fact participants did
> not interact with the discussion as it evolved.
Following the suggestion by both reviewers, we moved the methods section to a
more prominent part of the article and extended the "Experiment design"
section to include details about the manipulations, participant actions, and
demographics of participants. In addition, we explain the added the Ethics
Statement with more details about the guidelines followed to design the
experiments.
> Reviewer: 3
> The notion of "models of individual emotion dynamics" is introduced with a
> list of examples (p. 3, "cellular automata", "bifurcations in dynamical

> the concept in some details.
We appreciate the comment by the reviewer, as our previous version of the
introduction did not illustrate well how agent-based modelling has been
applied to emotions. We added short descriptions of those previous modelling
approaches, to explain better the concept and the research background:
"For example, coherence in self-evaluation has been modelled as a cellular
automaton [42], in which memories are represented by cells and the attitude of
an individual to certain memory evolves depending on its relationship to
other memories, leading to the emergence of self-esteem. Concepts of dynamical
systems can also be applied to model emotions, for example explaining fight or
flee reactions as bifurcations [43] in which the emotional state of an
organism can sharply change depending on a control parameter. Furthermore, the
principle of Browinan agents [30] has been proved useful to analyze the
temporal evolution of core affect [33], modeling changes in emotions as
equations with a deterministic and a stochastic component."
> A bit further in the text comes the "Cyberemotions modeling framework". In
> the sentence that follows, it is said that this framework "allows the
> creation of models of user emotions etc." But besides this definition by the
> use, nothing is said of what "Cyerberemotions framework" means and
> represents, where it comes from and so forth
To give some background about the origins and applications of the Cyberemotions framework,
we added the following text to the introduction:
"As part of an interdisciplinary collaboration to understand the dynamics of
collective emotions in online communities [46], the Cyberemotions modeling
framework [12] was designed to provide generative mechanisms of online
collective emotions, explicitly avoiding the pitfall of using ad hoc
assumptions and implausible dynamics. This framework allows the creation of
models of user emotions under different kinds of online interaction, linking
collective behavior with individual dynamics in the presence of online
interaction mechanisms."
> The model that is at the core of the paper is described under the title 2
> "Emotional agents model". I had a hard time to go through it and to figure
> out exactly what the variables were. As far as possible, I would prefer
> reading first a detailed and clarified exposure of the variables in the
> model and their interrelations, followed in a later step by the set of
> equation formalizing them. As an illustration of the difficulties I met,
> "expression s" is first mentioned in the legend of Figure 1. It is only
> later on p. 4 that the notion of "expression" shows up in the text supposed

> that "the dynamics of the perceived emotional content (…) are influenced by
> the emotional content of the expression of the agents, si(t)". The notion of
> "expression rules" emerges a number of times in the article but as far as I
> have seen, it is never introduced or defined.
We thank the reviewer for these comments. We revised in detail the model
description, adding explicit references to all variables in the first
paragraph including the following text:
"Agents have an expression variable s_i(t) that quantifies their displayed
emotions through online posts, which are aggregated with the expression of
other agents in the online field of interaction h."
We follow the suggestion of the reviewer to verbally explain the dynamics
before the equations, adding the following explanation early in the section:
"Thirdly, the expression of an agent through s_i(t) is assumed to be triggered
by expression rules that determine the value of s_i(t) based on the emotional
state of the agent, leading to a feedback of expression that changes in the
emotional state of the agent after expression. "
> As regards the Methods, I regretted that the methods section took place only
> at the end of the paper. But this might be a specific requirement of the
> journal. In any case, it is impossible to go through the Results and
> Discussion sections without a minimal knowledge of what was done in study 1,
> 2 and 3. So, this minimal information could be sketched before the beginning
> of Section 3.
We followed the suggestion of the reviewer and moved the methods section
before the results section.
> The reader might want to know the context of the studies (what was said to
> participants?). Information available about studies 1 and 2 is really
> minimal, and virtually absent for study 3—which should certainly be
> corrected.
As also suggested by the other reviewer, we improved the explanation of all
experiment designs in this new revision.
Appendix C
We thank the editor and reviewers for their input. In the following, we explain

We rewrote the introduction to clarify the relation to group processes and not
to refer to group identification, as suggested by the reviewer.
