This is a really nice paper by Mulholland and coworkers, that presents a projector-based
embedding approach for performing QM/MM calculations of biochemical reactivity, and applies
it to studying enzyme enantioselectivity. The methodology-dependence of the results of
QM/MM calculations is a real headache for trying to perform such studies, and the results
presented in Figures 3 and 4 are beautiful. The manuscript is also well written and easy to follow.
I have only two minor corrections:
Pg. 54, last two lines: "previously The" needs correcting.
Pg. 5, the authors point out the the inclusion of oxaloacetate in the QM region, despite being a
spectator molecule in the deprotonation, is known to decrease the barrier height by 3 kcal/mol. A
sentence about why this is likely the case would be nice.
Apart from this, I am delighted to recommend the manuscript for publication.

Zhang et al reports the application of projection-based embedding scheme in predicting the
enantioselectivity of citrate synthase. It is an interesting research that may eliminate the influence
of using different DFT functional in QM/MM study of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The
manuscript is well written with systematic calculations conducted. There are a couple of
questions the authors need to clarify before it is accepted for publication.
1. The barrier difference shown in Figure 4 (right panel) is marginal for the canonical and
embedding methods. e.g. the difference estimated based on LDA functional is 0.63 and 0.12
kcal/mol using canonical and embedding methods. high-level calculations such as coupled
cluster theory can estimate barrier within 1 kcal/mol of experimental value. However, the subtle
difference less than 1 kcal/mol should not be overstated.
2. It looks both canonical and embedding methods using the BHLYP functional gave satisfactory
results in absolute barrier as well as the relative barrier difference between the Z and E enolate
intermediate, comparable with that calculated using SCS-MP2 method (Figure 4). Why this
functional outperforms other functionals should be rationalized.
3. How efficient is this protocol compared with the method (B3LYP/6-31+g(d)//CHARMM with
single-point energy correction at SCS-MP2/aug-cc-Pvdz//CHARMM27) reported by
(Mulholland AJ, 2001, Angewandte Chemie, 2011, 50:10349), which has reproduced reaction
barrier difference for production of the two enolate intermediates? It would be useful to include
the benchmark comparison of the timing requested for both methods.
Minor revisions:
1. Line 26, Page 4, I believe it is the O-H bond length instead of C-H bond.
2. Figure 1, the condensation reaction step the arrow for hydrogen abstraction should be from
oxygen atom of the oxaloacetate to the proton.

have added an explanation as follows (and corrected 3 kcal mol-1 to ~3 kcal mol-1, as
nded):
inclusion of oxaloacetate in the QM region, despite it being a spectator molecule in the
rotonation, is known to decrease the barrier height by ~3 kcal mol-1,[13] likely due to the
usion of oxaloacetate polarization by the enzyme active site and its influence on the
lization reaction.[24]

ng et al reports the application of projection-based embedding scheme in predicting the
ntioselectivity of citrate synthase. It is an interesting research that may eliminate the influence
sing different DFT functional in QM/MM study of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The
nuscript is well written with systematic calculations conducted. There are a couple of
stions the authors need to clarify before it is accepted for publication.
he barrier difference shown in Figure 4 (right panel) is marginal for the canonical and
bedding methods. e.g. the difference estimated based on LDA functional is 0.63 and 0.12
l/mol using canonical and embedding methods. high-level calculations such as coupled
ster theory can estimate barrier within 1 kcal/mol of experimental value. However, the subtle
erence less than 1 kcal/mol should not be overstated.
agree, but would also like to point out that the difference in barrier is the key property to
mate the degree of enantioselectivity, and that embedding consistently improves the estimate
the difference in barrier. To emphasize the subtle difference, we have added a mention of this
he text as follows:
] this is most likely due the subsystem B densities being improved by its inclusion. We note
t the energy differences in this case are very subtle (with differences between canonical and
bedding results ranging between 0.3-1.2 kcal mol-1), but embedding consistently improves the
mate for the difference in barrier, which is crucial to estimate the degree of enzyme
ntioselectivity. The overall improvement of the barrier difference with embedding shows that
projection embedding coupled with QM/MM does not just reliably calculate single point
rgies, but can also be used to accurately distinguish subtle (bio)chemical selectivity.
t looks both canonical and embedding methods using the BHLYP functional gave satisfactory
ults in absolute barrier as well as the relative barrier difference between the Z and E enolate
rmediate, comparable with that calculated using SCS-MP2 method (Figure 4). Why this
ctional outperforms other functionals should be rationalized.
reviewer points out correctly that the BH&HLYP functional (in our notation, BHLYP stands
BH&HLYP, as noted in the methods section) gives satisfactory results for the absolute
riers and barrier differences. We have shown and discussed the good performance of this
ctional in some length in ref. 13 (Testing High–Level QM/MM Methods for Modelling
yme Reactions: Acetyl–CoA Deprotonation in Citrate Synthase. J Phys Chem B 114, 11303–
14). In the current manuscript, we have added the following short description:
energy differences in the QM/MM activation barriers of E- and Z-enolate formation vary
ween functional (left panel of Fig. 4), and crucially, are different from the fully canonical
S-MP2 results. In this case, the BHLYP functional performs best, with satisfactory results for
h the absolute barriers and barrier difference between Z- and E-enolate formation. This is
ly a fortuitous combination of the large fraction of exact exchange in this functional and the
ticular enzyme-reactant conformation used here (see further ref. 13).
ow efficient is this protocol compared with the method (B3LYP/6-31+g(d)//CHARMM with
gle-point energy correction at SCS-MP2/aug-cc-Pvdz//CHARMM27) reported by
ulholland AJ, Angewandte Chemie, 2011, 50:10349), which has reproduced reaction barrier
erence for production of the two enolate intermediates? It would be useful to include the
chmark comparison of the timing requested for both methods.
adly speaking, we would anticipate that SCS-MP2 calculations on the full system require
ghly an order of magnitude more time than SCS-MP2-embedded DFT calculations. We have
ained this estimate by considering the number of occupied and virtual orbitals in each of the
tems. However, owing to the fact that each set of calculations was performed at different
es, using different software versions, on different computational hardware, a direct timing
parison is complicated, and therefore we prefer to refrain from publishing this value.
thermore, the acceleration benefits are extremely system dependent. The crucial point, which
believe is emphasized in the manuscript, is the fact that a comparable level of accuracy can
achieved by carrying out a higher-level calculation in a much smaller region than was
viously possible.

take the referee’s point here, but this recommendation would require additional arrows which
uld make the figures congested. We prefer Fig 1 as it stands, because we think that it offers
most concise representation of the mechanism.
