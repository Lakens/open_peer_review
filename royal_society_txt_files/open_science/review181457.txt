The submitted manuscript reported an optimized method for the preparation of PLGA
nanocarriers (RSV-PLGA-NPs) to deliver RSV to treat NAFLD. The manuscript was well done to
me. So I recommended its publication after the following comments were documented.
1. More experimental details should be added such as cell culture part.
2. The authors stated that “there are no accepted pharmacologic therapies for NAFLD currently”.
I suggest the author should be prudent to use the affirmative tone. Moreover, some of the
relevant reported works should be made a comparison in the introduction part.
3. Some errors and mistakes can be found in the text. The authors should carefully check their
MS.
4. The author state Nanocarrier has been rapidly received recognition for
enhancing the bioavailability and solubility, improving stability of drug [19],
especially for some highly hydrophobic drugs. the more references should be cited ,such as Chem
Commun (Camb). 2018,54(42):5369-5372, Cancer Res., 2017, 77, 6963-6974

following specific comments in order to improve the clarity and quality of the work.
Reviewer Information: Nicholas Geitner, PhD, Duke University
1. In the introduction, the authors state that although others have performed nano-encapsulations
of the drug RSV, none have used PLGA. Please provide some of the other examples and concrete
reasons to use PLGA over the alternatives.
2. Section 2.3 -- the term "well-proportioned PLGA solution" is vague. Please be more specific as
to what this means.

measurements are made. Please include in this section.
4. Section 2.5 -- Please provide additional information on the instrument, its settings, and more
specifics on how samples were prepared for imaging.
5. Please provide complete definitions of EE% and DL%, including exactly how they were
calculated.
6. Section 2.8 -- provide instrument information. Further, was any special sample preparation
necessary? Concentrations, and starting medium?
7. What is SDS, and why was it added in order to enhance the solubility of RSV? It seems that this
may directly affect results.
8. While sampling during release kinetics experiments, why was 1 mL solution without drug
replaced into the solution? This certainly affects concentrations free in solution. This may be
appropriate for simulating a large system, but it must be justified clearly.
9. At what concentration was FITC incubated together with RSV?
10. Please define the MTT solution, and what the cytotoxicity endpoint is in this case.

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
Response to Referees
We really appreciate the comments of the reviewers to improve the
clarity and quality of the work. And according to the comments, we have
revised the manuscript as follows.
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Reviewer comment:1. More experimental details should be added such as cell
culture part.
Author reply: As your great suggestion, we have already modified it in the paper
such as section 2.2., section 2.4., section 2.5., section 2.6., section 2.8., section
2.9., section 2.11..
Reviewer comment:2. The authors stated that “there are no accepted
pharmacologic therapies for NAFLD currently”. I suggest the author should be
prudent to use the affirmative tone. Moreover, some of the relevant reported
works should be made a comparison in the introduction part.
Author reply: Thank you for your advice. We have already modified it in
introduction—“However, there are few accepted pharmacologic therapies for NAFLD
currently [6], and the mainstay of treatment for NAFLD presently is the adoption of
lifestyle changes aimed at increased physical activity and moderate, sustained weight
loss [7]. Studies have assessed: insulin-sensitizing agents (thiazolidinediones);
anti-oxidants (vitamin E, hepatic iron reduction, betaine, S-adenosyl-methionine,
N-acetyl cysteine and probucol); lipid-lowering agents
(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors and fibrates); and
cytoprotective agents (ursodeoxycholic acid).[6, 7] But these pharmacological
therapies were lack of specificity and effectiveness.[6-8] So it remains an urgent need
for improved pharmacological therapies.”.
Reviewer comment:3. Some errors and mistakes can be found in the text. The
authors should carefully check their MS.
Author reply: Thank you for your mention. I will check the errors and mistakes
carefully.
Reviewer comment:4. The author state Nanocarrier has been rapidly received
recognition for enhancing the bioavailability and solubility, improving stability of
drug [19], especially for some highly hydrophobic drugs. the more references
should be cited ,such as Chem Commun (Camb). 2018,54(42):5369-5372,
Cancer Res., 2017, 77, 6963-6974
Author reply: As your good suggestion, we have already added it in
introduction—“ Nanocarrier has been rapidly received recognition for enhancing the
bioavailability and solubility, improving stability of drug [21], especially for some
highly hydrophobic drugs.[22, 23] Wang et al. converted cabazitaxel (a hydrophobic
and highly toxic anticancer drug) attached with flexible lipid chains to a systemic
self-deliverable nanotherapy, to can preserving its pharmacologic efficacy while
improving its safety profile.[22]”.
Appendix B
Response to Referees
We really appreciate the comments of the reviewers to improve the
clarity and quality of our work. And according to the specific comments,
we have revised the manuscript as follows.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_8
Reviewer comment:1. In the introduction, the authors state that although others have
performed nano-encapsulations of the drug RSV, none have used PLGA. Please provide some of
the other examples and concrete reasons to use PLGA over the alternatives.
Author reply: Thank you for your excellent comment. The modification has been
made in paper at section introduction—“Although there are some studies have
reported to use nano-drug delivery technology to encapsulate RSV, few paper reported
to just use PLGA as carrier to delivery RSV to treat NAFLD. PLGA has been
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be clinically applied for
some anti-cancer drugs.[25, 26] Because of the excellent biocompatibility and
degradability in a physiological environment, controlled release[27, 28], and its
biodegradation products (lactic acid and glycolic acid) which are metabolites
presenting in the human body, PLGA has been used as an effective carrier for drug
delivery[21].”
Reviewer comment:2. Section 2.3 -- the term "well-proportioned PLGA solution" is vague.
Please be more specific as to what this means.
Author reply: Thanks for your mention. I have explained it in paper at section 2.3. It
means that PLGA was dissolved completely in the solution which formed a
homogeneous liquid.
Reviewer comment:3. Section 2.4 -- For size and zeta potential, it is imperative to specify the
medium in which these measurements are made. Please include in this section.
Author reply: Thanks for your mention. I have added it in paper at section 2.4 —“The
nanoparticles were dissolved in deionized water and the concentration was 5mg/ml.”.
Reviewer comment:4. Section 2.5 -- Please provide additional information on the instrument,
its settings, and more specifics on how samples were prepared for imaging.
Author reply: Thanks for your advice. I have added it in paper at section 2.5 –- “The
morphology and size of dry PLGA-NPS and RSV-PLGA-NPS were measured by
field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (HITACHI, SU8010, Japan) and
Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) (Bruker, Dimension icon, USA). 0.2 mg of
nanoparticles was dissolved in 1 ml of deionized water. Then a drop of suspension of
PLGA-NPS or RSV-PLGA-NPs was placed on an alcohol-treated clean wafer and
dried at room temperature.
And because of your reminders, I have added information of other instruments in
paper such as section 2.6. and section 2.8..
Reviewer comment:5. Please provide complete definitions of EE% and DL%, including exactly
how they were calculated.
Author reply: As your great suggestion, we have already added it in the paper at
section 2.6— “EE% = W1/W2 × 100%
DL% = W1/ (W1+W3) × 100%
Where, W1 is the amount of RSV encapsulated in RSV-PLGA-NPs, and W2 is the total
amount of RSV used for preparation of nanoparticles, and W3 is the total amount of
PLGA used for preparation of nanoparticles.”.
And I have added the calculation of cummulative release% at section 2.9 –
“Cummulative release % = WR/WT × 100%
Where, WR is the amount of RSV that had been released in the medium including
being sampled every time, and WT is the total amount of RSV encapsulated in
RSV-PLGA-NPs.”.
Reviewer comment:6. Section 2.8 -- provide instrument information. Further, was any special
sample preparation necessary? Concentrations, and starting medium?
Author reply: Thanks for your mention again. The modification has been done at
section 2.8 – “The structure and composition-related functional groups of the
compounds were identified by infrared absorption spectroscopy (Bruker, Tensor<U+2161>,
Germany). The infrared spectra of naked RSV, PLGA-NPs and RSV-PLGA-NPs were
measured with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory at a wavelength of
4000-400 cm-1. The RSV powder and lyophilized RSV-PLGA-NPs and lyophilized
PLGA-NPs were used to be measured directly without special preparation.”
There is no need to do anything special sample preparation, because the samples are
powder.
Reviewer comment:7. What is SDS, and why was it added in order to enhance the solubility of
RSV? It seems that this may directly affect results.
Author reply: Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is a typical anionic surfactant, which has
good emulsifying and foaming properties and has a good solubilizing effect on highly
hydrophobic matter. The surfactant has a solubilizing effect on the hydrophobic
matter. When the concentration of the surfactant solution exceeds the critical micelle
concentration (CMC), the non-polar group hydrocarbon chain of the surfactant forms
a hydrophobic core away from the water, and the polar group faced the water forms
an ordered combination of molecules such that the surface free energy is significantly
reduced so that it is stable in solution. Micellar is the simplest ordered combination of
surfactant molecules. The core of the micelle provides a hydrophobic environment for
the organic matter. Some substances that are insoluble or slightly soluble in water can
be dissolved therein, thereby improving solubility of the hydrophobic matter in
solution.
Because of the low solubility of RSV in water, it is easy to reach saturation
concentration in release medium when RSV is released in vitro, which would affect
our measurement of RSV' concentration in release medium. So we added some SDS
to just improving solubility of RSV in medium. It would not affect the release
process.
Reviewer comment:8. While sampling during release kinetics experiments, why was 1 mL
solution without drug replaced into the solution? This certainly affects concentrations free in
solution. This may be appropriate for simulating a large system, but it must be justified clearly.
Author reply: Since we took out 1 ml of the sample solution, we needed to replenish
the same volume of solution to ensure that the volume of the release medium was
always the same. The volume of the release medium was a total of 150 ml, and the 1
ml taken out was negligible relative to 150 ml. And when calculating the cumulative
release rate, we have considered the amount of drug in the liquid that was taken out.
Reviewer comment:9. At what concentration was FITC incubated together with RSV?
Author reply: Thanks for your mention. I have provided it at section 2.11 — “The
method of preparing FITC-labeled RSV-PLGA-NPs is the same as that of
RSV-PLGA-NPs just adding 200ul of 1 mg/ml FITC (green fluorescence) together
with RSV.”.
Reviewer comment:10. Please define the MTT solution, and what the cytotoxicity endpoint is
in this case.
Author reply: Thanks for your reminder. We used the MTT cell proliferation and
cytotoxicity assay kit (PH0533) purchased from Phygene directly to do experiments.
All the test solutions are already equipped, and the specific method of operation is
also in accordance with the instructions. MTT solution is their A reagents, and
Formazan Solvent is their B reagents, so the specific ingredients are not clear for us.
If you want to know more, you can refer to their instructions.
Reviewer comment:11. Section 2.17 -- The authors first state that proliferation was measured
by MTT assay, but later reference a protein kit; is this in error, or 2 different methods? It is
somewhat confusing.
Author reply: This is not a mistake, but two methods to characterize cell proliferation.
We used the MTT method to detect the proliferation of cells before induction, and the
protein assay to measure the proliferation of cells after induction. These two methods
are different in principle, but can be used to characterize the proliferation of cells.
Reviewer comment:12. Section 3.5 -- Please explain the method of analysis more clearly. Why
was a change in pH used to indicate degradation? What is the mechanism?
Author reply: PLGA undergoes hydrolytic degradation in aqueous environment where
ester linkages present along the polymer backbone are randomly hydrolyzed.
( Makadia H, Siegel S. Poly Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid (PLGA) as biodegradable
controlled drug delivery carrier. Polymers 3,1377–1397 (2011).) Each hydrolyzed
ester linkage forms one hydroxyl and one carboxylic acid group. Scission of long
polymer chains leads to reduction in the molecular weight of polymer that increases
its hydrophilicity and on further reduction forms water-soluble fragments. These
water-soluble fragments are hydrolyzed to lactic and glycolic acids that are finally
broken down to form energy, carbon dioxide and water by the normal metabolic
pathways of the body. (PLGA: a unique polymer for drug delivery. Therapeutic delivery. 6,
41-58. (10.4155/tde.14.91))
As PLGA degrades, the accumulation of acidic substances in the medium causes a
decrease in PH. Therefore, the degradation of PLGA can be characterized based on
changes in PH.
Thank you for your suggestion. The modification has been made at section 3.5—
“It is widely established that PLGA degradation in aqueous environment starts with
water uptake and the random hydrolysis of the ester bonds in the polymer backbone.
[46] Each hydrolyzed ester linkage forms one hydroxyl and one carboxylic acid group,
which leads to the production of acidic oligomers. [47] These acidic oligomers are
finally hydrolyzed to lactic and glycolic acids. [47] Therefore, the degradation of
PLGA can be characterized based on changes in PH with the accumulation of acidic
substances in the medium.”.
