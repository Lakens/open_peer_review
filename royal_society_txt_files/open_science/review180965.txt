This paper gives a comprehensive investigation on the application of forward osmosis in
extracting lithium from salt lake brine. An integrated process was designed to enrich lithium
using two different FO membranes. Overall, the paper has its merits in the application of FO in a
niche field. However, the following problems need to be addressed before it is considered for
publication in the journal.
1. The Mg/Li mole ratio was nearly 1.1 according to Table 1. However, the Chaerhan salt lake
brine has a typical high Mg/Li ratio. the author should explain why the other salt concentration
(other than Li) is so low in this study.
2. The equations in line 40s and 50 (page 4) should be labelled, and the meaning of each symbol
should be explained.
3. ‘The more small angle, the more hydrophilic’ based on the section of 3.3, however, the
conclusion was ‘that the support layer had better hydrophilicity’, it is self-contradiction since the
support layer has a bigger contact angle in this study.
4. In this study, Mg2+ was also concentrated, so the author should further explain how to
separate Li and Mg effectively.
5. There are various methods to uptake lithium from brine like extraction, adsorption and other
membranes. Therefore, ] a comparison between these methods and forward osmosis should
provided.

This manuscript deals with enrichment of lithum from salt lake brine by forward osmosis, the
authoes proposed a FO process,which is a potential and green technique in salt lake seperation, to
enrich lithum without high cost further evaparator,Nonetheless, the quality of the paper would
possibly be enhanced a little bit by the taking care of the following suggestions:
1. the data listed in Table 2 had shown that molar ratio of Li/Mg was decreased obviously after a
FO process. The authors suggest this is due to the penetration of Li+, if this is true, the study of
seperation Li+ and Mg2+ using FO techique meaningless.I wonder whether the Li+ was adsorbed
on the surface of TFC-ES.This can be identified by analysis the Li contents in MgCl2 or NaCl
draw solution.
2.Usually the C=O VIBRATION peak is quite strong,but in Fig. 5. the IR of TFC-ES represent a
weak C=O peak at 1647 cm-1,and a C-N peak at 1460 cm-1,why? the materials of active layer and
polyester screen support do not contain the polyamide, where the amide group come from?

Appendix A
Reviewer: 1
1. The Mg/Li mole ratio was nearly 1.1 according to Table 1. However, the
Chaerhan salt lake brine has a typical high Mg/Li ratio. the author should
explain why the other salt concentration (other than Li) is so low in this study.
Prior to extracting lithium, Chaerhan salt lake brine with high Mg/Li ratio have
to undergo several different stages, such as removing NaCl, KCl by salt field
evaporation, extracting H3BO3 and removing MgCl2 by precipitation. In the process,
the Mg/Li ratio decreased gradually, then the Mg/Li ratio was nearly 1.1 in the brine
which was feed solution in this experiment. Only after further concentration and
separation, Li+ can be precipitated with lithium carbonate.
2. The equations in line 40s and 50 (page 4) should be labelled, and the meaning
of each symbol should be explained.
Thank you very much for the reminder. The meaning of each symbol had be
explained in the revision.
3. ‘The more small angle, the more hydrophilic’ based on the section of 3.3,
however, the conclusion was ‘that the support layer had better hydrophilicity’, it
is self-contradiction since the support layer has a bigger contact angle in this
study.
We are very sorry, it was confused because of our careless work. This had been
corrected in the revision, "the contact angle of active layer is smaller than support
layer, suggesting that the active layer had better hydrophilicity, so that the AL-DS
orientation made the water flux higher. "
4. In this study, Mg2+ was also concentrated, so the author should further explain
how to separate Li and Mg effectively.
Generally speaking, lithium extracted from salt lake is finally precipitated with
lithium carbonate at 90<U+2103>. Before this, deep magnesium removal by chemical
precipitation is necessary preliminary. To a certain extent FO(Forward Osmosis) can
enrich lithium, however it was still can't meet the requirements rely only on physical
approach. Separating Li and Mg effectively by FO is direction we are forwarding.
5. There are various methods to uptake lithium from brine like extraction,
adsorption and other membranes. Therefore, a comparison between these
methods and forward osmosis should provided.
Extraction, adsorption and previous membrane are mainly used to separate Li and
other metal ions, FO can be used to enrich or concentrate lithium to set the stage for
separation. Besides, RO and NF processes require external energy expenditure to
force water pass through the membranes, extraction introduces organic reagent to
easily resulted in pollution and adsorption has too small treatment capacity. These
contents are also added in the introduction in revision.

1. In the section of Abstract, the abbreviation of "AL-FS" should be given its full
name when it appeared firstly.
Thank you very much for the reminder. The meaning the abbreviation of “AL-FS”
had be given in the revision.
2. There are some mistakes in the paper: (1) wasterwater should be
"wastewater" in line 36, Page 2, (2) "membrane" should be "membrane" in line
48, Page 2; (3) some words were missing in line 13-line 15, Page 5; (4) some
words were missing in line 39 - line 41, Page 5; (5) The word "polarizeation"
should be "polarization" in line 43, Page 5.
Thank you very much for the reminder. Spelling mistakes and missing words had
been corrected in the revision.
2. In Page 9, line 8 - line 12, " the contact angle of active layer is smaller than
support layer, suggesting that the support layer had better hydrophilicity", the
above description might be wrong, please check it.
We are very sorry, it was confused because of our careless work. This had been

3. The objective of this paper is to concentrate Lithium from salt lake in order to
use the Lithium. As mentioned in the paper that there are still other metal ion in
the salt lake water, during the concentration, all of these metal ion were
condensed all together, so how could you solve the purifying problem?
Generally speaking, lithium extracted from salt lake is finally precipitated with
lithium carbonate at 90<U+2103>. Before this, deep magnesium removal is necessary
preliminary, and the other metal ions were still in the solution which could be
recycled. To a certain extent FO(Forward Osmosis) can enrich lithium, yet after FO,
extracting lithium falls within production process of lithium carbonate. Our group has
done a lot of work in this area.

1. The data listed in Table 2 had shown that molar ratio of Li/Mg was decreased
obviously after a FO process. The authors suggest this is due to the penetration
of Li+, if this is true, the study of seperation Li+ and Mg2+ using FO techique
meaningless. I wonder whether the Li+ was adsorbed on the surface of TFC-ES.
This can be identified by analysis the Li contents in MgCl2 or NaCl draw
solution.
A little Li does exist in MgCl2 and NaCl draw solution when we analyzed, but it is
not meaningless. The condensed feed solution is used in production of lithium
carbonate; the diluted draw solution is back to the salt field for the cyclic utilization.
In the long run, Li in draw solution will eventually be recycled.
2. Usually the C=O VIBRATION peak is quite strong,but in Fig. 5. the IR of
TFC-ES represent a weak C=O peak at 1647 cm-1,and a C-N peak at 1460
cm-1,why? the materials of active layer and polyester screen support do not
contain the polyamide, where the amide group come from?
Thank you very much for the reminder. After repeated discussions, we concluded
that the peaks at 1647 cm-1and1460 cm-1 were at fault and be corrected in
revision(The peak at 1647cm-1 and 1460 cm-1 represented the iamide and substituted
benzene of polyurethane respectively).The main component of TFC-ES is polyimide,
so the amide group does exist.
