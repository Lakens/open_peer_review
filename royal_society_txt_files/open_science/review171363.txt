IT would be nice if coefficients of d31 or d33 could be estimated. The paper also needs

Response: Thanks for the comment. As suggested by the reviewer, we have estimated
the coefficients of d31 and d33 as below and included at the end of section 4 in the
revision as below.
Moreover, the piezoelectric coefficients of d31 and d33 of the fabricated PZT film

Also, we have added the following information about comparison of the
proposed method and literature in the introduction section in the revision as below.
Several research groups have worked on the hydrothermal synthesis of PZT
films. Abe et al. presented hydrothermal synthesized lead zirconate titanate
polycrystals deposited on a titanium substrate with source material
ZrOCl2·8H2O/Pb(NO3)2/KOH/TiO2 = 60 mL (0.25 M) / 100 mL (0.5 M) /200 mL (4
M) /1g and synthesis conditions: 160 °C, 0.5 MPa, stirring speed from 50 to 245 rpm,
deposition time from 1 to 24 hr [17]. The results show the solution stirred at 245 rpm
and deposition for 5 hr is an optimum condition. This causes approximately 20 µm
thick PZT film with crystal size of 1.5 µm.
Suchanek et al. investigate the hydrothermal deposition of PZT films on single-
crystal SrTiO3 (100) substrates [19]. The reaction conditions of precursor
concentration (Zr+Ti 0.3 M) and mineralizer concentration (KOH, 6 and 10 M) were
chosen. All depositions were executed at a temperature of 150 °C for 24 h. The
stirring speed ranged from 0 to 1700 rpm. The results show that no film and the film
thickness from 90 nm to 1225 nm were obtained. No film occurs at KOH of 6 M and
stirring speed of 1700 rpm. The maximum thickness of 1225 nm occurs at KOH of
6 M and no stirring condition.
Ohba et al. utilized two hydrothermal processes to fabricated PZT thin film on
titanium film [20]. The first process of PZT nucleation employed solution of
Pb(NO3)2, ZrOCl2 and KOH (8 M) with Pb/Zr molar ratio of 2.29. The deposition
temperature and time are 150 °C and 48 h, respectively. The second process of PZT
crystal growth uses Pb(NO3)2, ZrOCl2, TiCl4 and KOH (4 M). The molar ratio of
Pb:Zr:Ti is 110:52:48. The deposition temperature and time are 120 °C and 24-120
hr, respectively. The obtained PZT film thickness is from 10 to 23 µm with a
gradually increase trend when the deposition time of the second process is from 24
to 120 hr. The density, Young’s modulus and electromechanical coupling factor of
PZT film are 4800 kg/m3, 42 GPa and 0.33, respectively.
You et al. hydrothermally grow PZT thin films on a titanium substrate at 160
°C for 12h. The precursor solution included ZrOCl2·8H2O (Concentration 1.67 M)/
TiCl4 (1.97 M)/ Pb(NO3)2 (1 M) /KOH (8M) [25]. The results show the PZT crystal
displays a micron-sized hexahedron shape with well-developed facets. The chemical
formula of the PZT crystal is expected to be PbZr0.4Ti0.6O3.
Compared to aforementioned works, our study uses relative higher KOH
concentration (10 M) and quite different ratio of Pb/Zr/Ti in precursor solution for
hydrothermally synthesis of PZT film. The results show a 10um thick PZT film can
be formed on the titanium sheet with pretty good polycrystalline structure when the
deposition temperature maintains at 180 °C.
The process (Figure 3) to form hemispherical membrane lacks details (diameter,
thickness and cross-section).
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. We have added the detailed information in the
fabrication process (as Fig. 2 in the revision) including diameter of hemispherical
membrane, thickness of each layer, and characteristic dimension of cross-section.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript tends to grow hydrothermal PZT film using KOH for the development
of resonator. The topic is of interest and easy to follow. For a higher quality of the
paper, there are several suggestions below to be addressed:
1) Rewrite the abstract to be more straight forward.
Response: Thanks for the comment. We have rewritten the abstract to make it more
straight forward in the revision as below:
This paper presents the study of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) films hydrothermally
grown on the dome-shaped titanium diaphragm. Few articles in the literature address
the implementation of hydrothermal PZT films on curved-diaphragm substrates for
resonators. In this study, a 50-µm-thick titanium sheet is embossed using balls of
designed dimensions to shape a dome-shaped cavity array. Through single-process
hydrothermal synthesis, PZT films are grown on both sides of the processed titanium
diaphragm with good adhesion and uniformity. The hydrothermal synthesis process
involves a high concentration of potassium hydroxide solution and excess amounts
of lead acetate and zirconium oxychlorideoctahydrate. Varied deposition times and
temperatures of PZT films are investigated. The grown films are characterized by X-
ray diffraction and scanning electron microcopy. The 10-µm-thick PZT dome-
shaped resonators with 60- and 20-µm-thick supporting layers are implemented and
further tested. Results for both resonators indicate that large electromechanical
coupling coefficients and a series resonance of 95 MHz from 14 MHz can be
attained. The device is connected to a complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor
integrated circuit for analysis of oscillator applications. The oscillator reaches a Q
value of 6300 in air. The resonator exhibits a better sensing stability when loaded
with water as compared to air.
2) There are a lot of missing letters or something in the article such as in Page 2 Line
57, Page 4 line 25, Page 6 Line 21 to Line 41, Page 8, Line 38.
Response: Thanks for pointing out the locations of missing letters. We have carefully
corrected these typos in the revision.
3) Figure 4, it will be better if the specifical changes wanted to be identified in the
figures corresponding to the texts;
Response: Thanks for the comment. We have added the information described in the
text to the figures so that the specific changes can be identified. Please check the
updated figure 4 in the revision.
4) Generally, more descriptions are needed for the important figures, such as in Page
6, Line 30-36, so what conclusion it can make from figure 5? Longer hours better?
Higher temperature better? No conclusion or analysis has been done from the
figure. In Page 7 Line 10 to 20, what conclusion can be made from Figure 6? How
does the etching influence and why? No analysis and explanation again.
Response: Thanks for the questions. We have added more description in the revision
as below.
Based on the results shown in Fig. 5(a)-(c), we found the sample processed at 180 °C
exhibited a better polycrystalline structure and grain boundaries compared to that
processed in either lower temperature 170 °C or higher temperature 190 °C. Moreover,
the sample processed with longer hours at a certain temperature condition exhibited a
better polycrystalline structure. For example, the largest peak has the highest intensity
compared to the samples deposited at 180 °C for 24 hr and 36 hr.
Regarding “what conclusion can be made from Figure 6? How does the etching
influence and why? No analysis and explanation again.”, we have added the following
information in the revision:
The series (fs) and parallel (fp) resonant frequencies are 14.1 MHz and 90.5 MHz,
respectively, for the device without reducing the thickness of the thickness of the
backing PZT and Ti supporting layers. After the etching process to remove the backing
PZT layer and reduce the Ti support layer to 20 µm, the device with the series and
parallel resonance frequencies are 95.2 MHz and 116 MHz, respectively<U+3002>
The etching process removes the backing PZT film and makes the titanium substrate
become thinner, which results in higher series and parallel resonance frequencies. This
can be evaluated by electrical impedance calculation. To simplify this analysis, we
neglect the curvature effect and consider the planar device with the same layer
composition as the fabricated device (Fig. 7). Also, the planar device operates in a
thickness extension mode, such that the lateral dimension of the piezoelectric plate is
greater than the thickness. Using the Mason model and transfer matrix method [28], we
can derive the electrical impedance of the fabricated device looking into between the
top and bottom surfaces of PZT film as
e V 1 k2t (z1 +z2 )sin<U+03B3>+j2(1-cos<U+03B3>)
ZPZT = I
= j<U+03C9>C [1 - <U+03B3> (z1 +z2 )cos<U+03B3>+j(1+z1 z2 )sin<U+03B3>
] (8)
0
where z1 = Z1 /Z0 and z2 = Z2 /Z0 are the normalized acoustic impedance on both
sides of the PZT film. Z2 acoustic impedance of the parylene insulation and top
electrode, Z1 is the acoustic impedance of the bottom electrode, Z0 the acoustic
impedance of the piezoelectric layer. <U+03B3> = <U+03C9>d/v is the phase delay of the acoustic wave
in the PZT layer. <U+F077> is the angular velocity and v is propagation velocity. d is the
thickness of PZT layer.
Moreover, the input impedance between two electrodes of the fabricated resonator
can be calculated as
e e e 1 1 1 1 k2 (z1 +z2 )sin<U+03B3>+j2(1-cos<U+03B3>)
Zin = ZPZT + Zparylene = j<U+03C9> (C + C ) - j<U+03C9>C [ <U+03B3>t (z ]
0 parylene 0 1 +z2 )cos<U+03B3>+j(1+z1 z2 )sin<U+03B3>
(9)
Using the parameters listed in Table 1 for evaluation, the results indicate that the
resonator structured with a 10-µm-thick PZT backside layer and a 50-µm-thick titanium
layer has a series resonant frequency of 35.85 MHz and parallel resonant frequency of
35.91 MHz. If the backside PZT layer were totally etched away and the 20-µm-thick
titanium supporting layer were left, the fundamental series and parallel resonant
frequencies would become 78.72 and 79.75 MHz, respectively. It is obvious that the
resonator with the reduced thickness of substrate possesses higher resonant frequency.

instance, 6336, is it good or not? No justification how these numbers will be used
to define the system property or performance.
Response: Thanks for the comment. We have added the following statements to
compare our work with others and justify the system performance in the revision.
According to literature data, the common commercial quartz resonator
operates in air at 10 MHz has a quality factor of 6533 (approximately 7000)
[33, 34]. The quality factors of the micromachined 10 µm thick quartz
resonator operated at 100 MHz display a value of 780 for the resonator
without peripheral electrode and a value of 17900 for the resonator with
electrode optimization [35]. Also, the 52.6 MHz flexure-based mode of the
0.5 µm PZT on 4-µm silicon resonator is reported the quality factor of 122
[36]. Compared to aforementioned works, our resonator with Q value of
6336 is similar to the commercial quartz resonator operated at 10MHz. In
terms of operation at approximately 100 MHz, our Q value is better than the
Q value of the micromachined quartz resonator without peripheral electrode
but lower than that with electrode optimization. Regarding the PZT-film
constructed resonators operated in tens of MHz, the quality factor of our
resonator exhibits a superior performance compared to that of the flexure-
based mode of the silicon resonator.
6) Figure 10 (a), please use two different line type for temperature and resistance. It is
very unclear.
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. We have used dot and solid line types for
temperature and frequency, respectively, to clearly express these two lines in the
revision (Fig 10(a) has been changed to Fig. 11(a) in the revision).

7) Rewrite the conclusion since it is almost the same as abstract.
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. We have rewritten the conclusion to make it
more clear and catch the important points as below.
Using the precursor solution of an excess amount of lead acetate and zirconium
oxychlorideoctahydrate along with the high concentration of KOH solution to
hydrothermally grow PZT films on dome-shaped titanium diaphragms is investigated.
The resulting PZT films show a ferroelectric tetragonal phase at process temperatures
between 170 °C and 190 °C. Besides that, the sample processed at 180 °C exhibited a
better polycrystalline structure and grain boundaries. The formed PZT film is prone to
a Ti-rich phase and exhibits a preferred [101] orientation in our studied single-
deposition process.
The fabricated resonators demonstrate that an increase of 81 MHz can be attained
from the series resonance of 14 MHz after removing the backing PZT film and
reducing Ti substrate to 20 µm. The estimated piezoelectric constants d33 and d31 of
the fabricated PZT film are 470 pC/N and 1.62 pC/N, respectively. According to the
extracted parameters of the equivalent BVD circuit model, the coupling factors (K 2<U+0001D452><U+0001D453><U+0001D453> )
reach 97.6% and 32.6% with corresponding Q values of 1.38 and 60.9 for the two
studied cases, respectively. When the resonator was utilized as an oscillator, the
minimum Allan deviation values were 2.2 kHz and 80 Hz for 40 min tests in air and
water, respectively.
