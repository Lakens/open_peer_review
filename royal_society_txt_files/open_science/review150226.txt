Crewther at al. present a study of saccadic suppression and multifocal Visual Evoked Potentials
(VEP) in adults high and low in autistic tendency in order to explore the magnocellular visual
function in autism spectrum conditions. The study of perceptual processing in autism is timely,
given the recent inclusion of hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input in the DSM 5. The
manuscript is generally well written, the methods are sound but the discussion is inadequate.
There are a number of issues which diminish the enthusiasm of this reviewer, which I hope that
the authors will be able to address.
Introduction
- The introduction provides a clear and thorough overview to the relevant background
literature pertaining to saccadic suppression and it’s relation to magnocellular visual function but
does not adequately explain the magnocellular hypothesis of autism or reference any of the
seminal papers in this area. I suggest the authors broaden the introduction to cover to the ways in
which a magnocellular processing deficit might impact on perceptual processing in autism. I
know from the author’s previous papers that this literature is known to them, so why is it
omitted here?
- A clear hypothesis should be presented at the end of the introduction for both the VEP
and saccadic suppression results. What do you predict in terms of high and low AQ group
differences? A clear hypothesis for the VEP results, in particular, will help aid reader
understanding of the VEP results.
Methods
- If it’s possible I strongly recommend you include a figure to show what the stimuli in the
VEP recording session looked like. It’s impossible to imagine ‘pseudorandom binary m-
sequences’ consisting of ‘diffuse luminance patches’ of a given temporal contrast. I appreciate the
‘interpretation of the kernels’ section of the supplement but it would be extremely useful to
explain, in the manuscript, what the fixation and rapid eye movement conditions (and therefore
the difference wave upon which you make statistical inference) represent in clear and
nontechnical prose. Remind the reader what these conditions (at low and high contrasts) index
and what does the difference wave mean in terms of pagno- and parvo-cellular visual function. In
short, please aid the reader with interpretation of the VEP motivations (and results) more if
possible.
Results
- Please explain the abbreviation PEST and provide a few sentences explaining how
thresholds are calculated according to this procedure (perhaps in the methods). Since RS Open
Science is not a dedicated psychophysics journal readers will likely not be familiar.
- Please state how the outlier was determined.
- Maybe use subheadings to more clearly break up the VEP results into first order and
second order (1st and 2nd slice) responses and remind the reader succinctly of the
neurobiological interpretation of these kernels.
Discussion
- If it is the case that the authors were expecting to find reduced saccadic suppression (an
index of magnocellular function) in the high relative to low AQ groups but instead found the
opposite (at low spatial frequencies) then this doesn’t render the previous logic that saccadic
suppression is selective for the magnocellular pathway untenable. I suspect that if the low and
high AQ groups were averaged together the overall pattern would replicate Burr, Ross and
Morrone (i.e. greater suppression for low vs high spatial frequency stimuli overall). Does this not
3
simply demonstrate that there is substantial inter-individual difference in the magnitude of
saccadic suppression at low spatial frequencies and that this is captured (to some extent) by
individual differences in autistic tendency? If the direction of the differences is surprising then
the authors should provide a better exposition of what this might mean for perception in autism.
- I don’t think you can really argue that the high AQ group show enhanced saccadic
suppression when, in fact, they show saccadic suppression of a similar magnitude to the general
population in previous work. It is in fact your low-AQ group that are showing atypical saccadic
suppression and I would suggest that this is the result you should be trying to explain (n.b. see
above. arguing that the psychophysical measure of magnocellular function that you’ve chosen
might not be a pure measure of magnocellular function because you don’t find the effect in your
group with lower autistic tendency is somewhat circular).
- If you want to claim that thalamic responses are measurable using scalp electrodes
please provide references to support this claim.
- I find the VEP section hard to follow and I don’t see much actual ‘discussion’ of the
results. I would have expected the discussion to explicitly relate these VEP findings back to
magnocellular processing in some way or at least to clearly state the similarities/differences
between these findings and the findings from the author’s 2010 paper in the journal Brain. I
would also expect the relevance to autism and visual processing in autism to be made clear
and/or explored. In fact, at the point of the discussion it’s completely unclear to me whether
these VEP results were expected or not (let alone what they really have to say about visual
processing in autism), which is symptomatic of lacking a clear hypothesis from the beginning.
- The final paragraph clearly states the magnocellular processing hypothesis of autism
(ref. Kate P-G and others please) but does not in any way link this to the results presented in the
paper.
Additional points
- You do not empirically link saccadic suppression to local perceptual style so I don’t think
that you’re justified in mentioning this in the title. In fact, I also question whether you’ve really
shown ‘enhanced’ saccadic suppression in the high AQ group (see above).
- There is a strong theory of magnocellular processing that this pathway provides a rapid
access to the ‘gist’ of a visual scene which provides top-down predictions of visual input from
Moshe Bar. There is also a recent suggestion within the predictive coding framework that the
precision of prediction errors is weaker in autism from Karl Friston and others. It seems to me
that a magnocellular deficit in autism could provide weakened influence of predictions in visual
processing. This is an idea that you might want to explore further in the discussion.

Summary
This nicely written paper presents a combined psychophysical and electrophysiological study of
saccadic suppression in typical individuals. These typical individuals are divided into those who
score high and low on the AQ, which is a self-report measure of autistic traits. Previous literature
suggests that the typical pattern of saccadic suppression is confined to the magnocellular
pathway, and the authors thought that there might be some anomaly of this in the high-AQ
scorers. However, they found to their surprise that, if anything, the high-AQ scorers showed the
“typical” pattern of saccadic suppression, with more apparent suppression in the magnocellular
pathway, than did the low-AQ scorers who showed similar levels of suppression in both magno
and parvo streams (or, at least, for low- and high-sf stimuli). This intriguing result is backed up
by suggestive differences in VEP responses. It is argued that differences in level of saccadic
suppression might be the cause of the well known “attention to detail” trait of autism.
General Comments
1. In the literature on diagnosed Autism Spectrum Disorder, whilst most do not question
the behavioural trait of “attention to detail” there is now some doubt about the robustness of the
experimental evidence in favour of it. See the meta-analysis by Van der Hallen et al (2014)
Psychological Bulletin http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/bul0000004. You should probably cite this
paper.
2. There is a sub-scale of the AQ which is “Attention to detail”. It would be interesting to
see if the suppression scores correlate particularly well with that sub-scale, if the authors’ ideas
are correct.
Specific Comments (Using manuscript, not pdf file pages and using author-generated line
numbers because they match the text)
p. 4, line 96: I think it is better to use “typical” rather than “normal”
Introduction: An ingenious argument which suggests that the previously-found magnocellular
advantage to saccadic suppression might be due to individual differences in the population.
p. 5, Methods, 1st para: The selection of the population is a little enigmatic. Was a large
population screened and low and high scorers selected or were only these 28 participants
screened and then a median split employed?
p. 5, Nonlinear VEP section: The presentation conditions seem to differ somewhat between the
psychophysical and VEP experiments. In particular, in the former there is a one-off movement
5
every trial, whereas in the latter the movements are regular and sustained. I would think that
different neural mechanisms might come into play for these two different situations, with the
latter being a bit more like smooth pursuit. I guess if the only crucial thing is the speed of the eye
movement then they are equivalent, but I wonder if there are differences in high-level expectation
between these two presentation modes which might be important in the the interpretation of the
results? Maybe the authors could comment on this in a bit more detail.

Keywords: autistic tendency, magnocellular, saccadic suppression, nonlinear VEP
Abstract: Saccadic suppression – the reduction of visual sensitivity during rapid eye movements
– has previously been proposed to reflect a specific suppression of the magnocellular visual
system, with electrophysiological and magnetic stimulation experiments identifying its neural
site as at or prior to afferent visual information reaching striate cortex. Dysfunction in the
magnocellular visual pathway has been associated with perceptual and physiological anomalies
in individuals with autism spectrum disorder or high autistic tendency (measured on the AQ
scale), leading us to question whether saccadic suppression is altered in autism. Here we show
that individuals with high autistic tendency show greater saccadic suppression of low vs. high
spatial frequency gratings while those with low autistic tendency do not. Thus, the magnocellular
theory of saccadic suppression is untenable as a general description. In addition, those with High
but not Low AQ demonstrated very early (35-45 ms) differences in cortical visual evoked
potentials to a large, pseudo-randomly flashing bar under conditions of fixation versus frequent
saccades at low contrast, prior to the time of cortical activation. Both AQ groups, however,
showed similar eye movement dependent effects in later epochs (80-160 ms). A causal
explanation for the bias towards local perceptual style seen in autism results, due to selective
suppression of low spatial frequency information accompanying every saccadic eye movement.

Keywords: autistic tendency, magnocellular, saccadic suppression, nonlinear VEP
Abstract: Saccadic suppression – the reduction of visual sensitivity during rapid eye movements
– has previously been proposed to reflect a specific suppression of the magnocellular visual
system, with the initial neural site of that suppression at or prior to afferent visual information
reaching striate cortex. Dysfunction in the magnocellular visual pathway has also been associated
with perceptual and physiological anomalies in individuals with autism spectrum disorder or
high autistic tendency, leading us to question whether saccadic suppression is altered in the
broader autism phenotype. Here we show that individuals with high autistic tendency show
greater saccadic suppression of low vs. high spatial frequency gratings while those with low
autistic tendency do not. In addition, those with High but not Low AQ demonstrated pre-cortical
(35-45 ms) evoked potential differences (saccade versus fixation) to a large, low contrast, pseudo-
15
randomly flashing bar. Both AQ groups showed similar differential VEP effects in later epochs
(80-160 ms) at high contrast. Thus, the magnocellular theory of saccadic suppression appears
untenable as a general description for the typically developing population. Our results also
suggest that the bias towards local perceptual style reported in autism may be due to selective
suppression of low spatial frequency information accompanying every saccadic eye movement.

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-150226.R1)
Reviewer 2 quite rightly found some awkward expression in lines 1424 146 of the manuscript.
Hence we would like to replace these. The text from around line 142 - 147 now reads: Two small
fixation dots were placed on the screen 10° apart. The luminance of the patch fluctuated between
two levels, under the control of a pseudorandom binary m-sequence (m=14; see Figures 2a, 2b).
Each 4 min sequence was divided into 8x30 s epochs. In one condition, the participant maintained
fixation on either one of the dots for 30 s. In the second condition, the participant made rapid
saccades at a rate of about 2Hz between the dots for the duration of a 30 s epoch. Please note also
that a defect in the bottom axis of Figure 2 has been fixed. The manuscript file is attached. Thank

percentage of the typically developing population
with AQ scores of 12 and below (the criterion for our
Low AQ group) is over 23%, based on a recent large
sample of 450 [41]. By comparison, the literature on
saccadic suppression comprises studies with small
population samples that may or may not cover the
variation of autistic tendency in the population.
Indeed, if such participants were recruited from
scientists, engineers or students studying these
courses, then higher AQ scores than the population

However when resampled from the combined
population back to the sample size of the high or
low AQ groups and testing for spatial frequency
differences between randomly selected binary
splits of the data, the experimental data clearly
show the greatest effect in terms of p value
(across 1000 resamplings).
How representative the average of High AQ and
Low AQ data is of the centre of the AQ
distribution is unknown, although it is likely to lie
somewhere in between. Consider three models
of low spatial frequency suppression as a
function of AQ, designed with exactly the same
Low AQ and High AQ data. Each of the three
models would show greater suppression for the
combined Low and High AQ groups compared
with the Low AQ group alone. However, it is
clear that such a summation of the Low and
High AQ data does not predict anything about
the Mid AQ data.
An empirical example of where such an average
does not predict the middle is found in the
