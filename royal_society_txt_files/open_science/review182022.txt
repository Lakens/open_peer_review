The paper provides compelling anatomical evidence regarding the specialized mechanosensory
function of cephalic and tail scale organs from two species of sea snake. I appreciate that the
authors have used a variety of histological and EM techniques to describe the unique
morphology of these organs, including careful measure of adjacent skin layers, suggesting
specialized tactile function, similar to the mechanosensory organs noted in terrestrial snakes.
I have a few suggestions:
1) A summary schematic figure would serve this paper well. I suggest two (or more panels)
representing the specialized cephalic organs, as well as the distinct tail organs. This could be
prepared from observations from all the microscopic techniques in total (e.g., relative location of
putative neuronal bundles from the PGP immunohistochemistry, numbers of center cells as based
on the counts from TEM, etc.) and would serve the authors well in visually showing the
differences in these organs, such as locations/numbers of discoid organs, lamellated corpuscles,
differences in thickness of the skin strata.
2) The paper could benefit with a little more discussion regarding the potential innervation of
these organs. The work of comparative neuroanatomists like Glenn Northcutt have showed
elaborate branching patterns that suggest particular sensory function/importance in fish, reptile,
and amphibian species, and these patterns have often been used to make evolutionary inferences.
The authors touch upon this in the "Tail scale organs" section in the discussion but this can be
taken a bit further. Innervation to the hydrodynamic sensors of the lateral line system- the
neuromasts - arise through their own specialized cranial nerve system rather than trigeminal.
3) The authors could communicate with a little more confidence about the unlikely role of these
sense organs in electroreception (as in the last sentence of the Dermal photoreception... section).
Their histological sections do not seem to show any kind of canal or pore typical of passive
electroreceptors, like ampullary-type organs. Also, based on the sections shown in the paper, it
doesn't appear that their are more specialized active electroreceptive organs, like tuberous organs
or mormyromasts seen in freshwater weakly-electric fish.
Other minor correction/comments:
1) The background white balancing looks unusual among panels in Figs. 5 and 6.
2) The labels are difficult to read in Fig. 7, with the black labeling on top of the black and white
TEM. Perhaps the brightness or contrast could be adjusted, or the labels themselves colored.
3) The putative myelinated axon looks unusual with the sheathing appear very thin. The authors
acknowledge that this is the best resolution available, however.
4) In paragraph 2 of the discussion, the authors state that they can see free nerve axons
terminating in the alpha layers in Fig. 3. Free nerve endings are a specific kind of specialized
sensory end organ, often described as related to pain sensation. The nerve bundles adjacent to the
putative sense organs are visible, but free nerve endings terminating in the the distal epidermis
don't seem visible here (maybe just at this resolution).

In a previous study the authors found that fully marine, hydrophiine snakes had, on average, a
higher density of scale organs on cranial scales than their terrestrial relatives. Scale organs also
tended to be larger and cover a larger area of the scale, although there was broad overlap in these
measures. In the present study the authors consider whether the derived scale organs of marine
species have retained the ancestral mechanoreceptive (terrestrial) function, or if they have also
changed in function. They use light and transmission electron microscopy, and
immunohistochemistry to identify neuronal tissue to address the question. They show
convincingly that the scale receptors retain a mechanoreceptive (touch) function.
The study is sound, the conclusions reasonable and supported by the data. I have only a few
general comments and several small, editorial comments.
GENERAL COMMENTS
(1) [p. 4, 1st paragraph; p. 11, lines 335-336; p. 12, lines 339-340] There is some
ambiguity/mischaracterization about the role of mechanoreceptors in sensing ‘touch’ vs.
“hydrodynamic stimuli.” I believe that this is a false distinction. The evidence is that the snake
scale organs are mechanoreceptors sensitive to pressure. Pressure can take the form of physical
touch or a compression wave traveling through water (a hydrodynamic stimulus). Thus there is
not a dichotomy between ‘touch receptors’ and ‘hydrodynamic receptors’. The evidence suggests,
circumstantially, that the scale organs of snakes are adapted to be more sensitive to
pressure/mechanical stimuli then their terrestrial counterparts, presumably because water
pressure waves have less energy than a physical touch. To be clear, I believe that this is what the
authors mean to say, but as written, it is either unclear or the distinction is overstated. The
distinction relates to the nature or source of mechanical, pressure stimuli, not (necessarily) to the
nature of the receptors.
Related to the above, note that the Merkel cell neurite complexes characteristic of crocodilian
ISOs are also mechanosensory and hence would not actually play an “alternative sensory role”
4
(p. 4, lines 94-95). Finally, it is suggested (p. 4, lines 80-82) that Acrochordus uses its scale organs
to sense “water motion.” I do not believe this is true. My understanding is that the snakes
respond to physical touch of the fish. This should be checked.
(2) Throughout the paper the scale organs are referred to as “sensilla”. I understand that this
term is often used in the literature to refer to similar structures in squamate reptiles. However, it
is inaccurate and misleading as a sensillum is a hair-like structure (usually in insects or other
invertebrate taxa). It is also true that many lizard scale organs have a central hair-like protrusion
that could more accurately be called a sensillum (exclusive of the rest of the receptor). Other
terms are used in the literature for the sensory organs described in this paper, including ‘scale
organ’ and ‘integumentary sensory organ’ or ‘ISO’. These would seem to me to be far preferable
than “sensilla/sensillum”, but obviously this is the choice of the authors.
(3) Throughout the description of the sensory organs its inner, dermal component is referred to as
a “dermal capsule”. In my opinion, this is inaccurate and inconsistent with most anatomical
usage. A capsule represents a discrete covering or sheath that surrounds something [“a
membranous structure…that envelopes an organ”—Stedman’s Medical Dictionary, 27th ed.],
which is not the case here. The dermal protrusion into the epidermis is more accurately described
as a ‘dermal papilla’, as parenthetically noted on p. 5, line 134. This should be the term used
throughout the paper.
(4) Note that a finding of tactile/mechanoreception does not exclude all other possible functions,
e.g., they could still function in modifying flow over the snake’s surface (though unlikely).
EDITORIAL COMMENTS
Line 40: I do not believe that there is any evidence to support the assertion that snakes use
mechanoreceptors to discriminate prey types. This is pure speculation based on mixed receptor
types within the mouth. Evidence suggests that virtually all prey discrimination is chemosensory
(gustatory and vomeronasal).
Line 45: change “stimulus” to ‘stimuli’
Line 95: delete hyphen in “Merkel-cell”
Line 104: “collected 1 10 km offshore”; seems to be a typo, not clear what it should be
Line 127: and elsewhere; insert ‘trichrome after “Gomori’s one-step”; also, do not capitalize
“One-Step”
Line 130: delete “the height (thickness)” and change to ‘thickness’
Line 184: It is unclear what is meant by “horizontally arranged” in reference to the ‘central cells’;
in the images they are either clustered, vertical or circular—never horizontal
Line 187: re: the apparently basal taper in H. stokesii—are you sure that this is not simply a plane
of section issue? Did you have serial sections across the width of the receptors to confirm this?
From other images it appears that the dermal papilla extends outward/laterally toward the scale
surface, i.e., the distal part of the papilla is wider than its base. As such, a section that just passes
through the point that a lateral extension joins the central core would look tapered toward the
base.
Line 204: change “skin” to ‘scale’ for clarity
5
Line 238: change “present at base of dermal” to ‘present at the base of the dermal’
Line 247: replace the comma with a period; start new sentence with “The outer bumps…”
Line 279: The comment about “cap cells” based on Jackson (1977) seems a bit pointless. There is
no histological difference between the keratinocytes covering the dermal papilla and others.
Obviously any cells in this position would provide abrasion resistance, but no moreso than
anywhere else.
Lines 286-287: The figures do not show any direct evidence of discoid receptor innervation that I
can see. Obviously they must be innervated and the nerves get pretty close within the scale
organ, but no nerves leading directly to the discoid receptors, particularly the more distant,
epidermal receptors, are evident.
Lines 296-299: It seems implausible to me that the central cells have no sensory function. What’s
the point of the whole organ structure then, particularly given that discoid receptors are
distributed all over? How confident are you about this, i.e, what is the probability that you would
have seen synaptic complexes? There are neurons all over within the dermal papilla and it seems
unlikely that they are merely supplying discoid receptors. What else would they be doing? Just
free nerve endings?
Lines 359-362: Catania (1995), ref. 59, does not provide any evidence for sensitivity to
hydrodynamic stimuli in star-nosed moles, nor can I find any other reference to such a thing.
They definitely use the star organ for direct touch of food objects while foraging within water, but
again (see General Comment 1), this is no different from terrestrial touch. I did not check ref. 60
for the platypus, but I would confirm that they do, indeed, have receptors that are sensitive to
water movement AND that they have been “co-opted” from terrestrial cutaneous touch receptors.
In fact, I would confirm this for all of them. Direct touch underwater is not the same thing as
being used to detect water movement (hydrodynamic stimuli). Pinniped whiskers are a good
example for mammals (they use them to detect vortices indicating fish trails) [see review by
Dehnhardt & Mauck (2008), pp. 295-314, In Sensory Evolution on the Threshold, JGM Thewissen
and S. Nummela (eds.), Univ. of California Press, Berkeley, CA]. also manatee whiskers and body
hairs [reviewed in Bauer et al. (2018) The tactile senses of marine mammals. Int. J. Comp.
Psychology 31, special issue, M. Botero ed.].
Line 401: insert ‘compared to a’ after “differential sensitivity”
Line 402: I don’t see why the trigeminal or other cranial nerves that innervate cephalic cutaneous
receptors are “specialized”… The sensory organs they innervate might be specialized receptors,
but the cranial nerves, themselves, are not specialized.
Line 404: the “dorsal root ganglion” is not a “peripheral nerve of the spinal cord”—it is a part of
the spinal nerve within which the sensory nerve bodies lie. For lines 402-404, it is sufficient to
note that the cephalic receptors are innervated by cranial nerves while the postcranial receptors
are innervated by spinal nerves, which is exactly what one would expect.
Line 406: the receptors are not used “to actively seek”—they are used while he snake actively
seeks…
Line 409: do you mean ‘electrophysiological’ rather than ‘electrophysical’?
Lines 429-432: there is also no histological support for a magnetic sense

The paper provides compelling anatomical evidence regarding the specialized mechanosensory

I have a few suggestions:
1) A summary schematic figure would serve this paper well. I suggest two (or more panels)
representing the specialized cephalic organs, as well as the distinct tail organs. This could be
prepared from observations from all the microscopic techniques in total (e.g., relative location of
putative neuronal bundles from the PGP immunohistochemistry, numbers of center cells as based
on the counts from TEM, etc.) and would serve the authors well in visually showing the
differences in these organs, such as locations/numbers of discoid organs, lamellated corpuscles,
differences in thickness of the skin strata.
2) The paper could benefit with a little more discussion regarding the potential innervation of
these organs. The work of comparative neuroanatomists like Glenn Northcutt have showed
elaborate branching patterns that suggest particular sensory function/importance in fish, reptile,
and amphibian species, and these patterns have often been used to make evolutionary inferences.
The authors touch upon this in the "Tail scale organs" section in the discussion but this can be
taken a bit further. Innervation to the hydrodynamic sensors of the lateral line system- the
neuromasts - arise through their own specialized cranial nerve system rather than trigeminal.
3) The authors could communicate with a little more confidence about the unlikely role of these

Their histological sections do not seem to show any kind of canal or pore typical of passive

doesn't appear that their are more specialized active electroreceptive organs, like tuberous organs
or mormyromasts seen in freshwater weakly-electric fish.
Other minor correction/comments:
1) The background white balancing looks unusual among panels in Figs. 5 and 6.
2) The labels are difficult to read in Fig. 7, with the black labeling on top of the black and white
TEM. Perhaps the brightness or contrast could be adjusted, or the labels themselves colored.
3) The putative myelinated axon looks unusual with the sheathing appear very thin. The authors
acknowledge that this is the best resolution available, however.
4) In paragraph 2 of the discussion, the authors state that they can see free nerve axons
terminating in the alpha layers in Fig. 3. Free nerve endings are a specific kind of specialized
sensory end organ, often described as related to pain sensation. The nerve bundles adjacent to the
putative sense organs are visible, but free nerve endings terminating in the the distal epidermis
don't seem visible here (maybe just at this resolution).

The study is sound, the conclusions reasonable and supported by the data. I have only a few
general comments and several small, editorial comments.
GENERAL COMMENTS
(1) [p. 4, 1st paragraph; p. 11, lines 335-336; p. 12, lines 339-340] There is some
ambiguity/mischaracterization about the role of mechanoreceptors in sensing ‘touch’ vs.
“hydrodynamic stimuli.” I believe that this is a false distinction. The evidence is that the snake

(2) Throughout the paper the scale organs are referred to as “sensilla”. I understand that this
term is often used in the literature to refer to similar structures in squamate reptiles. However, it
is inaccurate and misleading as a sensillum is a hair-like structure (usually in insects or other
invertebrate taxa). It is also true that many lizard scale organs have a central hair-like protrusion
that could more accurately be called a sensillum (exclusive of the rest of the receptor). Other
terms are used in the literature for the sensory organs described in this paper, including ‘scale
organ’ and ‘integumentary sensory organ’ or ‘ISO’. These would seem to me to be far preferable
than “sensilla/sensillum”, but obviously this is the choice of the authors.
(3) Throughout the description of the sensory organs its inner, dermal component is referred to as

as a ‘dermal papilla’, as parenthetically noted on p. 5, line 134. This should be the term used
throughout the paper.
(4) Note that a finding of tactile/mechanoreception does not exclude all other possible functions,
e.g., they could still function in modifying flow over the snake’s surface (though unlikely).

Dear Andrew Dunn,
We are delighted to have our paper “Ultrastructural evidence of a mechanosensory function
of scale ‘sensilla’ in sea snakes (Hydrophiinae)” accepted for publication in Open Science.
We are grateful for the detailed and constructive comments that have enhanced the quality of
the manuscript. We have made the recommended changes, all of which are minor, with one
exception: unfortunately, we were not able to include a schematic diagram (as suggested by
Reviewer 1) at this time. Please see our responses to reviewer comments below.

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper provides compelling anatomical evidence regarding the specialized
mechanosensory function of cephalic and tail scale organs from two species of sea snake. I
appreciate that the authors have used a variety of histological and EM techniques to describe
the unique morphology of these organs, including careful measure of adjacent skin layers,
suggesting specialized tactile function, similar to the mechanosensory organs noted in
terrestrial snakes.

Comments to the Author(s)
In a previous study the authors found that fully marine, hydrophiine snakes had, on average, a
higher density of scale organs on cranial scales than their terrestrial relatives. Scale organs
also tended to be larger and cover a larger area of the scale, although there was broad overlap
in these measures. In the present study the authors consider whether the derived scale organs
of marine species have retained the ancestral mechanoreceptive (terrestrial) function, or if
they have also changed in function. They use light and transmission electron microscopy, and
immunohistochemistry to identify neuronal tissue to address the question. They show
convincingly that the scale receptors retain a mechanoreceptive (touch) function.
The study is sound, the conclusions reasonable and supported by the data. I have only a few
general comments and several small, editorial comments.

11 Abstract
12 The evolution of epidermal scales was a major innovation in lepidosaurs, providing a barrier
13 to dehydration and physical stress, while functioning as a sensitive interface for detecting
14 mechanical stimuli in the environment. In snakes, mechanoreception involves tiny scale
15 organs (‘sensilla’) that are concentrated on the surface of the head. The fully marine sea
16 snakes (Hydrophiinae) are closely related to terrestrial hydrophiine snakes but have
17 substantially more protruding (dome-shaped) sensillascale organs that often cover a larger
18 portion of the scale surface. Various divergent selection pressures in the marine environment
19 could account for this morphological variation, including relating to enhanced detection of
20 mechanical stimuli (from direct contact with stimuli and/or indirect contact via water motion
21 (i.e. ‘hydrodynamic reception’either tactile or hydrodynamic), or co-option for alternate
22 sensory or non-sensory functions. We addressed these hypotheses using
23 immunohistochemistry and light- and electron microscopy to describe the cells and nerve
24 connections underlying scale sensillaorgans in two sea snakes, Aipysurus laevis and
25 Hydrophis stokesii. Our results show ultrastructural features in the cephalic sensillascale
26 organs of both marine species that closely resemble the mechanosensitive Meissner-like
27 corpuscles that underlie terrestrial snake sensillascale organs. We conclude that the
28 sensillascale organs of marine hydrophiines have retained a mechanosensory function, but

33 Introduction
34 Hardened epidermal scales are a characteristic trait of snakes (and other lepidosaurs: lizards
35 and tuatara) that facilitate defensive signalling, camouflage, water retention, and locomotion
36 (1–3). The epidermal scales also provide the primary surface for mechanoreception, which is
37 the ability to sense mechanical stimuli that result from pressure or physical displacement
38 (vibration) (4). Scale organs (‘sensilla’ or (‘tubercles’ sensu (5–7) are small
39 mechanoreceptors that protrude from the surface of epidermal scales of the head and body of
40 snakes. Snakes are likely to use these mechanosensory organs to explore and navigate

42 (10), and feeding (11,12) behaviorus, but the anatomy and neurophysiology of scale
43 sensillaorgans are conspicuously understudied in comparison to other sensory organs (e.g. ,
44 for example, eyes (13), , auditory structures (14), vomeronasal organ (15) and, heat-sensing
45 pits (16).
46 In terrestrial snakes, scale sensillaorgans are concentrated on the head and are highly
47 sensitive to mechanical stimulation, particularly moving stimulius (17–20). The underlying
48 ultrastructure of cephalic scale sensillaorgans consists of an innervated cluster of dermal cells
49 (‘dermal papillacapsule’) that displaces the surrounding epidermis to create round skin
50 elevations (21–23). These underlying features of scale sensillaorgans have been likened to
51 ‘Meissner corpuscles’, which are low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) sensitive to
52 innocuous (‘light touch’) stimuli in the glabrous (hairless) skin of mammals (24,25). Scale
53 sensillaorgans on the body head are less more specialised in their underlying ultrastructure
54 than on the body, which: they lack dermal capsulepapillaes and the outer skin elevations are
55 instead caused by a superficial thickening of the epidermis (10,26). These ultrastructural
56 differences between head and body scale sensilla, and the concentration of sensilla on the
57 head, are thought to reflect the role of the head as the primary tactile interface in snakes
58 (17,27).
59 Snakes exhibit substantial variation in the size, shape, density, and distributions of their
60 scale sensillaorgans. Enlarged and/or high densities of sensilla scale organs have been
61 reported in fossorial snakes (e.g. Leptotyphopidae) and some sea snakes (Hydrophiinae), Formatted: Font: Italic
62 whereas in other colubroid snakes sensillaorgans are small and/or sparse (e.g. Dipsadinae) or
63 even absent in some species (e.g. Viperidae) (22,27–29). Interspecific differences in the traits
64 of these sensillascale organs traits likely relate to various aspects of species’ environment,
65 ecology, and phylogeny. However, our understanding of the adaptive diversity functional of
66 snake sensillascale organs is hindered by a lack of comparative data describing differences in
67 the external traits of scale sensillaorgans traits and their underlying ultrastructure.
68 Hydrophiine snakes (Elapidae) provide a useful comparative framework to investigate
69 the evolution of squamate scale sensillaorgans in response to major ecological transitions (7).
70 The fully marine, viviparous sea snakes comprise a clade of more than 60 species that
71 evolved within the terrestrial Australian hydrophiine radiation (tiger snakes, death adders,
72 taipans) approximately 9 to 18 million years ago (30). Previous work has found that the
73 cephalic scale sensillaorgans of sea snakes are substantially more protruding (dome-shaped)
74 compared to their terrestrial counterparts, and in some lineages cover a much larger
75 proportion of the scale surface (> 6% versus < 2.5% in sampled taxa) (7), . This divergence in
3
76 external sensilla morphology might reflect divergent selection pressures in the marine
77 environment. However, the hitherto lack of data on the ultrastructure of scale sensillaorgans
78 in sea snakes precludes meaningful comparisons with terrestrial snakes.
79 In their external appearance, the dome-shaped sensilla scale organs of sea snakes
80 closely resemble the integumentary scale organs (ISOs) of crocodilians, which are cephalic
81 mechanoreceptors with elaborate Merkel-cellMerkel cell neurite complexes and sensitivity to
82 water motion (i.e. hydrodynamic reception) (31–33). A dome-shaped scale organ provides
83 increased surface area for stimuli to be received from multiple directions, possibly enhancing
84 hydrodynamic mechanoreception sensitivity in an aquatic habitat whereby water motion can
85 be detected from both biotic sources, e.g. conspecifics, prey and predators, and abiotic Formatted: Font: Italic
86 sources, e.g. turbulence caused by water currents deflected past objects. (4). Indeed, two Formatted: Font: Italic
87 independently aquatic snake generas, Erpeton and Acrochordus, are distantly related to
88 hydrophiine sea snakes but have protruding organs that are likely to be sensitive to water
89 motion generated by the movement of fish prey (i.e. hydrodynamic stimuli) (5,34). It is also
90 plausible that scale sensillaorgans have been co-opted in sea snakes for a different sensory
91 modality, such as dermal photoreception phototaxis (found in Aipysurus sea snakes (35,36), Commented [JC1]: ‘Crowe-Riddell et al.’ has been
published
92 or electromagnetic sensing for navigation (15). Alternatively, scale sensillaorgans may have
93 been co-opted for a non-sensory function such as enhanced friction for gripping during
94 mating, or disruption of the skin boundary layer to increase swimming performance
95 (analogous to the denticles of shark skin or tubercles on the fins of whales, (37–39)).
96 We aimed to better understand the evolution of scale sensillaorgans in sea snakes by
97 describing their ultrastructure in two fully-aquatic species, (Aipysurus laevis and Hydrophis
98 stokesii,) using immunohistochemistry, and light and electron microscopy. If sea snake scale
99 sensillaorgans are retained for a modified for enhanced mechanosensory roles, either tactile
100 close-contact touch or detection of hydrodynamicwater motion (deflected off objects or
101 prey/predators), we would expect them to have retained the ultrastructure described in
102 terrestrial snakes, and possibly contain other sensory cells such as the Merkel cell neurite
103 complexes of crocodilian ISOs. Co-option for alternative sensory roles would be implicated if
104 different cell types are present, such as the Merkel-cell neurite complexes of crocodilian
105 ISOs. Finally, if dome-shaped sensillascale organs provide a non-sensory (e.g. structural)
106 function, we would expect their elevation from the skin surface to be created by superficial
107 thickening of the epidermis with no associated neuronal or receptive cells.

108 Materials and methods
109 Specimens and tissue sampling
110 Two museum specimens of the sea snake species Aipysurus laevis (one individual) and
111 Hydrophis stokesii (one individual) were used for gross morphological observations. Fresh
112 specimens of these species (two individuals of A. laevis; one individual of H. stokesii) were
113 collected 1 t<U+0336> o 10 km offshore from the coast of Broome, Western Australia, in June 2015 and
114 September 2016.
115 Immediately after euthanasia, cephalic scales were sampled from all three sea snakes,
116 and tail scales were sampled from the posterior dorsal surface and ventral tip of the tail in a
117 single A. laevis because this species exhibits tail phototaxis linked to dermal photoreception
118 (36). Entire scales were dissected to sample the whole skin from epidermis to subcutaneous
119 tissue. The specimen details and locations of sampled scales are shown in Table 1 and Figure
120 1. A single specimen of Oxyuranus scutellatus (the Australian taipan) was sourced from a
121 captive breeding population (Venom Supplies Pty Ltd, South Australia) to sample brain
122 tissue for antibody controls (see below) because this species is closely related to viviparous
123 the sea snakes (30). All samples were fixed by immersion in either 4% paraformaldehyde for
124 immunohistochemistry, or 1.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde for electron-
125 microscopy. After immersion in fixative for 24 hours, samples were washed and stored in
126 phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) with sucrose, before being transferred into
127 phosphate buffer with 0.05% sodium azide.
128 Stereo and light microscopy
129 The outer skin morphology of museum specimens was examined using a stereomicroscope
130 with a mounted camera (SMZ25, Nikon Inc., Japan). Specimens were submerged in water
131 and illuminated by a ring of light-emitting diodes (P2-FIRL LED Ring Illumination Unit,
132 Nikon Inc., Japan) to reduce specular reflections from the scales. A high-depth-of-field
133 photographic image was composed using imaging software (NIS-Elements Advanced
134 Research v5.10, Nikon Inc., Japan).
135 The general cellular morphology of the skin samples was examined using light
136 microscopy. Samples were dehydrated by successive immersion in alcohol, then paraffin-
137 embedded for serial sectioning (10 µm). Slides were stained with hemotoxylin-eosin or
138 Gomori’s One-Step (40), scanned using a digital slide scanner (Nanozoomer, Hamamatsu
139 Photonics, Japan) and measurements taken using imaging software (Nanozoomer Digital
5
140 Pathology v2.6, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). We measured the height (thickness) of the
141 epidermis located above scale sensillaorgans, and at adjacent areas of skin that did not
142 contain sensillaorgans. Because the outer layer of hardened skin (beta layer) sometimes
143 became artificially separated from surrounding layers during tissue processing, we measured
144 only the living (nucleated) epidermal layer (stratum germinativum). The diameter and height
145 of dermal capsulespapillae (papilla) and other dermal structures were measured and the ratio
146 of diameter:height calculated.
147 Statistics
148 We used the two-sample t–test (unpaired) to examine differences in epidermal thickness
149 between scale organs and adjacent skin that did not contain scale organs. Before statistical
150 analyses, we checked that data were normally distributed using Bartlett’s test. Statistical
151 analyses were performed using base packages in R v3.5.1 (R Core Team, 2017).
152 Immunohistochemistry
153 Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded serial sections (10 µm) for a
154 neuronal marker, protein gene product 9.5 (PgP9.5). Briefly, slides were blocked for
155 endogenous peroxidase with 0.5% hydrogen peroxide in methanol at room temperature for 30
156 minutes (min). Slides were rinsed in PBS and processed in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0) for
157 heat-induced epitope retrieval. Slides were washed twice in PBS, before blocking in 3%
158 normal horse serum (NHS) in PBS for 30 min. Sections were incubated with mouse
159 monoclonal anti-PgP9.5 antibody (dilution 1:2000 with 3% NHS) at room temperature
160 overnight. Sections were then washed twice in PBS and incubated with a peroxidase-
161 conjugated secondary antibody (IgG anti-mouse, 1:500 diluted in PBS with 3% NHS) for 30
162 min, then incubated with streptavin peroxide (dilution 1:1000 with 3% NHS) for 1 hour.
163 Binding sites were revealed using a red chromogen (NovaRed Peroxidase Substrate Kit,
164 Vector, USA) according to manufacturer instructions and incubated for 2 to 3 min. Slides
165 were washed in distilled water for 5 min before counterstaining in Harris hematoxylin for 30
166 to 60 seconds and allowed to air dry. A primary antibody control was performed using the
167 above protocol on snake (taipan) brain tissue; a secondary antibody control was performed
168 using the above protocol, with the primary antibody incubation step omitted, on snake brain
169 and cephalic skin tissue. Slides were imaged using an optical microscope (BX51, Olympus,
170 Australia) and the saturation and hue of images was adjusted using imaging software (Adobe
171 Photoshop v2017.1.1, Adobe Systems Inc., USA). Unfortunately, due to preservation issues
6
172 we were unable to perform immunohistochemistry on these cephalic skin sections in A.
173 laevis.
174 Electron microscopy
175 To view ultrastructure, skin samples were prepared for electron microscopy. Samples were
176 post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide solution, then dehydrated in ascending series of ethanol
177 and infiltrated in epoxy resin. Resin blocks were then polymerised overnight at 70 degrees
178 Celsius. Semi-thin (1 µm) sections were cut and stained with toluidine blue to locate an
179 individual scale sensillumorgan under light microscopy. Ultra-thin (70 nm) sections were cut
180 and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were placed on nickel coated mesh
181 grids and viewed at 100 kV under a transmission electron microscope (Tecnai G2 Spirit TEM,
182 FEI Company, USA).
183 Results
184 Several epidermal layers were identified using light microscopy: the nucleated layer (stratum
185 germinativum) was non-keratinised corneous and consisted of a basal layer of elongate or
186 columnar cells and one to three layers of round, loosely arrange keratinocytes; the non-
187 nucleated layer (stratum corneum) consisted of keratinised corneous a and ß cells. According Commented [JC2]: Not technically ‘keratinised’ as
hardened structure is not derived from ‘keratins’ – updated
188 to definitions from (1,3), skin samples that were viewed under light microscopy (Table 1) ref
189 were in the resting phase of epidermal shedding cycle; skin samples viewed under the
190 electron microscope (Table 3.1) appeared to be in pre-renewal phase.
191 Cephalic scale organs
192 Observed under a stereomicroscope, the cephalic scale sensillaorgans appeared as
193 unpigmented external elevations (‘bumps’) of outer skin (Figure 1). Observed under light
194 microscopy, the cephalic scale sensillaorgans of A. laevis (Figure 2) and H. stokesii (Figure
195 3) shared a similar structure that consisted of a cluster of 9 to 11 cells (‘central cells’), which
196 were horizontally arranged, originatinged in the dermis and evaginated evaginating the
197 epidermis to create a dermal capsulepapilla (‘papilla’). The ratio of length to diameter of the
198 dermal capsulepapilla was approximately 1:1 for both A. laevis and H. stokesii (Table S1).
199 The dermal capsulepapilla was occasionally tapered at its basal end in H. stokesii (Figure
200 3A), but but this likely to be an artefact of tissue sectioning. remained expanded in A. laevis
201 (Figure 2B, C). In some dermal capsulespapillae we were able to identify a blood vessel
202 leading to (and thus presumably vascularising) the central cells (Figure 2B). In H. stokesii,
7
203 the Gomori’s One StepGomori’s one step trichrome stain revealed collagen fibres
204 interspersed between central cells and often separated the dermal capsulepapilla from
205 keratinocytes within the epidermis (Figure 3C). In both species, the dermal capsulepapilla
206 displaced surrounding epidermal layers so that the columnar cells of the stratum
207 germinativum were positioned above the dermal capsulepapilla, causing the bumps of the
208 outer skin surface (Figure 2; Figure 3). In A. laevis, the epidermis above the dermal
209 capsulepapilla (‘cap cells’) was approximately 50% thinner than the epidermis of the
210 surrounding regions of skin that did not contain sensillaorgans (17 µm; t = -11.16, 110 d.f., P
211 < 0.001) and in H. stokesii, it was approximately 15% thinner than the adjacent flat epidermis
212 (28 µm; t = -2.19, 67 d.f., P = 0.03).
213 There was a second type of dermal capsulepapilla on the cephalic scales in H. stokesii
214 that contained approximately 10 central cells and displaced the surrounding epidermis but, in
215 contrast to the cephalic scale sensillaorgans, did not result in a distinctive bumps in the outer
216 skin surface (Figure 3.4). These smaller scale sensillaorgans were more variable in shape
217 compared to typical sensillaorgans (ratio length:diameter 1.7; Table S1) and often located at
218 the base of depressions on the outer surface of the scalekin (Figure 4). The epidermis above
219 the dermal capsulepapilla was 25% thinner than adjacent flat epidermis (25 µm, t = -2.76, 26
220 d.f., P = 0.01; approximately same height as cap cellsthe epidermis above papilla of other
221 cephalic sensillaorgans, t = 0.85, 12 d.f., P = 0.41).
222 The cephalic dermis and epidermis of H. stokesii were immunoreactive for PGP9.5
223 (Figure 3.5). Specificity of immunoreactions were confirmed by antibody controls (Figure
224 S1) and by the localised staining of nerve bundles that had previously been identified under
225 light microscopy (Figure 2A; Figure 3A). Dermal axons travelled to the scale sensillaorgans
226 (Figure 5C), then meandered through the central dermal capsulepapilla before innervating the
227 outer epidermis and often (presumably) terminating as distinct discoid endings in the alpha
228 layer (Figure 5A, B). These discoid endings were primarily located above the dermal
229 capsulepapilla, but were also present in flat epidermis that did not contain sensillaorgans
230 (Figure 6A). Unfortunately, the second type of dermal capsulespapillae in H. stokesii
231 (described above; Figure 4) were not present in the sections stained for
232 immunohistochemistry.
233 Immunoreactions were also localised to ovoid structures within the cephalic dermis of
234 H. stokesii (Figure 3.6). These structures corresponded to lamellar cells that were ovoid in
235 shape and resembled small Pacinian-like corpuscles (mean length 29 ± 15 µm and mean
236 diameter of 22 ± 12 µm; Table S1). The location of these ‘lamellar corpuscles’ in H. stokesii
8
237 ranged from 61 to 124 µm (mean 93 µm) depth from the basal layer of the epidermis.
238 Lamellar corpuscles were also identified in the cephalic dermis of A. laevis that were a
239 similar ovoid shape (mean length 37 ± 26 µm and mean diameter 25 ± 5 µm; Figure 2C) to
240 those found on the cephalic dermis of H. stokesii. The location of the lamellar corpuscles in
241 A. laevis ranged from 53 to 168 µm (mean 118 µm; Table S1) depth from the basal layer of
242 the epidermis. Although the lamellar corpuscles were dispersed throughout the dermis
243 (stratum laxum), they were often subjacent to scale sensillaorgans (Figure 2C; Figure 3B,C).
244 Unfortunately, due to preservation issues we were unable to perform immunohistochemistry
245 on these cephalic skin sections in A. laevis.
246 The dermal capsulepapilla of a scale sensillumorgan was observed in A. laevis using
247 electron microscopy (Figure 7). High magnification images showed a cluster of central cells
248 within the dermal capsulepapilla (Figure 7B). These central cells were distinguished from
249 surrounding keratinocytes by their round shape and lack of tonofilaments (Figure 7B inset
250 two). Tonofilaments were present in the intracellular space of keratinocytes throughout the
251 epidermis (Figure 7B). Tight junctions (desmosomes) and associated tonofibrils can be seen
252 between central cells and keratinocytes (Figure 7B inset two. In the intercellular domain,
253 small bundles of transverse collagen fibres and a single, small putative nerve axon were
254 present at base of the dermal capsulepapilla (closer to dermis; Figure 7B inset one). Small
255 phospholipid inclusions were also present (Figure 7B inset one). Unfortunately, we were
256 unable to image the putative axon at higher magnification so could not confirm the presence
257 of neuronal elements (e.g. lamellar arrangement of Schwann cells, neurofilaments).
258 Scale organs on the tail of Aipysurus laevis
259 Two scale structures were identified in the tail skin of A. laevis. Although, we were unable to
260 discern bumps in the outer tail skin surface using a stereomicroscope (Figure 1B), several
261 skin elevations were identified in cross-sections of the skin under light microscopy (Figure
262 8). The epidermal elevations of the tail (‘tail scale sensillaorgans’) lacked the dermal
263 capsulespapillae associated with the cephalic scale sensillaorgans,. Tthe outer bumps were
264 instead created by thickening of the epidermis (Figure 8A), which was 57% thicker than
265 adjacent flat epidermis (47 µm, t = 14.18, 86 d.f., P < 0.001) and 17 µm (65%) thicker than
266 cap cellsthe epidermis above of cephalic scale sensillaorgans (t = -14.26, 18 d.f., P < 0.001).
267 Tail scale sensillaorgans also lacked the collagen fibres and blood vessels that were
268 associated with cephalic scale sensillaorgans. A second scale structure identified in the tail
269 skin of A. laevis consisted of a small dermal capsulepapilla of approximately 10 central cells
9
270 with a ratio of length and diameter of 1:1 (Table S1; Figure 8B). Although the dermal
271 capsulepapilla displaced the surrounding epidermal layer (including the columnar cells of the
272 stratum germinativum) this did not result in elevations of the outer epidermis (Figure 6B).
273 The epidermis above the dermal capsulepapilla was 42% thinner than adjacent epidermis that
274 did not contain dermal capsulespapillae (11 µm; t = -4.65, 86 d.f., P < 0.001) and slightly
275 thinner (5.5 µm) than the cap cellsepidermis above of cephalic scale sensillaorgans (t = 2.59,
276 18 d.f., P = 0.02). Subjacent to these tail dermal capsulespapillae, collagen fibres in the
277 dermis (stratum laxum) were dispersed and melanosomes could not be seen (Figure 8B).
278 Unfortunately, due to preservation issues we were unable to perform immunohistochemistry
279 on these tail sections.
280 Discussion
281 Cephalic scale organs
282 Scale sensillaorgans and dermal capsulepapillae
283 Previous work found that the cephalic sensillascale organs of sea snakes are substantially
284 more protruding and often cover a larger proportion of the scale surface than the sensillascale
285 organs of terrestrial hydrophiine snakes (7). The present study shows that, despite these
286 differences, sensillaorgans in sea snakes have retained a similar underlying ultrastructure to
287 their terrestrial counterparts. The sensillascale organs examined in Aipysurus laevis and
288 Hydrophis stokesii are characterised by a dermal capsulepapilla that consists of an
289 aggregation of central cells with collagen fibres, blood vessels and nerve axons in the
290 intercellular domain that together displace the surrounding epidermis (Figure 2-7). A similar
291 underlying structure has been reported for the cephalic scale sensillaorgans of ten terrestrial
292 species representing the several major phylogenetic groups of snakes squamates including Commented [JC3]: ‘Squamates’ as snakes and lizards are
not monophyletic groups
293 (agamids, henophidians, iguanids scolecophidians, and colubroids, ) and lizards (agamids,
294 iguanids and varanids) (10,21–23,42–45). In terrestrial snakes and sea snakes, the epidermis
295 above the dermal capsulepapilla is comprised of columnar keratinocytes (i.e. stratum
296 germinavatum) that form a layer that is 15% to 50% thinner than the epidermis of adjacent
297 flat skin. The columnar keratinocytes above the dermal capsulepapilla have been described as
298 ‘cap cells’ in snakes and suggested to provide protection against abrasion or aid in
299 transducing mechanosensory stimuli (22).
300 We discovered that sea snake skin contained free nerve axons that extend from the dermis
301 and terminate within the alpha layer (epidermis) as distinct discoid structures (Figure 35). In
10
302 terrestrial colubroid snakes, these structures have variously been described as ‘discoid
303 receptors’ (21), ‘end bulbs’ (20) and ‘button-like’ (10) nerve endings. In the sea snake skin,
304 we found discoid receptors distributed throughout the epidermis, but aggregated above the
305 dermal capsulespapillae (Figure 5A, B) deriving from axons at the base of the dermal
306 capsulepapilla (Figure 3.5C). This adds evidence for a sensory function of scale
307 sensillaorgans in sea snakes.
308 Our images from transmission electron microscopy provide the first high resolution
309 ultrastructure data of a cephalic scale sensillum organ in a snake. Inspection of Figure 3.7B
310 shows that the central cells within dermal capsulepapilla are clearly differentiated from
311 surrounding keratinocytes by their lack of tonofilaments. Tonofilaments are keratin Commented [JC4]: Correct this
312 formations of keratin-like proteins that provide structural integrity to the squamate epidermis
313 (46). Although lacking in tonofilaments, central cells maintain contact elements with
314 surrounding keratinocytes via multiple tight junctions (desmosomes) (Figure 7B, inset two).
315 A putative axon was also identified in the intercellular domain of the dermal capsulepapilla
316 (Figure 7B, inset one), which may represent the ‘terminal receptors’ or myelinated axons
317 previously identified in lizards (45). We did not find synaptic contacts between axons and
318 central cells, which is consistent with light microscopy studies of other colubroid snakes (e.g.
319 Elaphe) (23). Nevertheless, the presence of discoid receptors superior to the dermal papilla
320 suggest that the and suggests that the central cells (and associated dermal capsule) have a
321 functional role in transducing mechanical stimuli. have a structural role rather than
322 functioning as a direct transducer of stimuli.
323 In addition to dermal capsulespapillae associated with cephalic scale sensillaorgans, we
324 detected capsulespapillae typically (but not always) located at the bottom base of depressions
325 in the outer skin in H. stokesii (Figure 4). These dermal capsulespapillae consisted of
326 approximately 10 central cells (Figure 5) and displaced surrounding keratinocytes but, in
327 contrast to the ultrastructure we describe for cephalic scale sensillaorgans, did not result in a
328 skin elevation (bump). Putative nerve structures leading to the dermal capsulepapilla were
329 identified using Gomori’s One StepGomori’s one step trichrome stain under light microscopy
330 (Figure 4B), but we were unable to conduct antibody staining of neuronal markers. It is
331 unclear whether these dermal capsulespapillae are distinct scale structures or merely
332 undeveloped or damaged scale sensillaorgans.
333
334 Lamellar corpuscles
11
335 We detected lamellated, ovoid cells in the deeper dermis of cephalic skin in both species
336 examined and demonstrated that these lamellar corpuscles were neuronal-positive in H.
337 stokesii (Figure 6). These structures resemble the ‘non-encapsulated lamellated receptors’
338 identified in other squamates such as (Boa, Elaphe, Iguana, and Agama genera)
339 (11,12,21,47). The location and shape of these receptors suggest that they are small, Pacinian-
340 like corpuscles (24,48). Pacinian (Vater-Pacini) corpuscles are rapidly adapting LTMRs that
341 are sensitive to skin indentation and vibratory (‘deep touch’) stimuli of high frequencies
342 (peak 250 Hz, range 40 to 800 Hz), and they are present in glabrous skin of mammals (24).
343 Pacinian corpuscles consist of connective tissue and fibroblasts lined by flat neuronal
344 ‘Schwann’ cells; the lamellar structures identified in sea snakes tested immuno-positive for
345 the neuronal maker PgP9.5 suggesting that these are indeed modified neuronal cells. The
346 sensitivity of these receptors has not been targeted examined in previous electrophysiological
347 tests ofin snakes skin.
348
349 Ancestral and derived sensory functions for cephalic scale organs
350 The ultrastructural features described above for cephalic scale sensillaorgans of terrestrial and Formatted: Indent: First line: 0 pi
351 marine snakes represent all of the components of Meissner-like corpuscles. Meissner
352 corpuscles are rapidly adapting LTMRs present in the dermal papillae of mammal glabrous
353 skin (48). Electrophysiological experiments of cranial nerves in colubroid snakes found that
354 they are rapidly adapting LTMRs with receptive fields that overlap with Meissner corpuscles
355 (i.e. 12 mm2, (17). Our finding that the cephalic sensillascale organs of sea snakes share a
356 very similar ultrastructure with their terrestrial relatives (and appear to lack novel or
357 specialised cell types) provides evidence that marine lineages have retained the ancestral
358 mechanosensory role for these organs.
359 The dome-shape and often high scale-coverage of scale mechanoreceptors in sea snakes
360 suggests divergent selection on these organs in marine environments, either for retained
361 (ancestral) enhanced sensitivity to tactile stimuli or a derived sensitivity to hydrodynamic
362 stimuli. Sea snakes forage in benthic habitats, frequently probing burrows and crevices as do
363 terrestrial snakes on land (49)., but there There is no obvious reason thatwhy sea snakes
364 should require a heightened tactile sense compared to terrestrial species. Sea snakes forage in
365 benthic habitats, frequently probing burrows and crevices as do terrestrial snakes on land
366 (51). It seems more likely that sea snakes have experienced selection pressures for sensitivity
367 to hydrodynamic stimuli (7). Observations of the sea snake Hydrophis (Pelamis) platurus
368 approaching and biting a vibrating object (50) provides some behavioural evidence that sea
12
369 snakes are responsive to hydrodynamic stimuli. Evoked potentials have been recorded from
370 the midbrain of the sea snake Hydrophis (Lapemis) curtus in response to a vibrating sphere
371 (50 to 200 Hz, peak sensitivity at 100 Hz), but no nervous response was successfully
372 recorded directly from a scale sensillumorgan of this species (51). However, more recently,
373 auditory evoked potentials were recorded (from the midbrain) of A. laevis and H. stokesii in
374 response to tone bursts from 40 to 600 Hz (peak sensitivity at 60 Hz) (Chapuis et al.,
375 unpublished dataunder review). These preliminary investigationsThis work showed that some
376 species of sea snakes are capable of detecting low amplitude water motion, and pressure
377 and/or particle motion caused by sound stimuli. Moreover, although Tthese studies were not
378 able to discern whether hydrodynamic stimuliwater motion wereas being received detected
379 by mechanoreceptive scale organs in the skin or hair-cells in the inner ear,. However, the
380 peak sensitivities to the mechanical stimuli broadly overlap with peak sensitivities of
381 Meissner (10 to 50 Hz) and Pacinian (200 to 300 Hz) corpuscles.
382 Hydrodynamic reception allows the detection of water motion, usually caused by water
383 disturbances or animal movement, and is characterised by very low frequency components
384 that (peak at 10 Hz with a , maximum of 50 Hz. This sensory ability It has evolved
385 repeatedly in aquatic organisms (e.g. the lateral line systems in fish, cephalopods and
386 amphibians) wherein hydrodynamic stimuli are transduced by cutaneous mechanoreceptors
387 (e.g. the lateral line systems in fish, cephalopods and amphibians (52,53). Cutaneous
388 mechanoreceptors have also been co-opted for hydrodynamic reception in aquatically-
389 foraging animalssecondarily-aquatic including mammals, a well-studied example of which
390 are the vibrissae (whiskers) of pinnipeds (54–56). (e.g. star-nosed moles (58), platypus (59),
391 birds (e.g. ducks, geese, ibis (60) and reptiles (61).
392 Among snakes, two independently aquatic taxa (that are distantly related to hydrophiines)
393 have evolved highly derived scale mechanoreceptors that putatively function too sense the
394 water motions generated by the movement of prey. Tentacled snakes (Erpeton tentaculum)
395 have the largest mechanoreceptors among vertebrates with two cephalic tentacles (measuring
396 2two to three 3 millimetres) and made up of dermis, epidermis and free nerve endings
397 (34,57). Scale ‘sensillae’ in file snakes (Acrochordus) are thought to be sensitive to the
398 hydrodynamic motion generated by the movement of fish prey. These small organs are
399 vascularised like sea snake scale sensillaorgans but instead of a dermal capsulepapilla they
400 consist of specialised epidermal cells that underlie highly-derived bristles that protrude from
401 the skin (5,15). Tentacled snakes (Erpeton tentaculum) have the largest mechanoreceptors
402 among vertebrates with two cephalic tentacles (2 to 3 millimetres) made up of dermis,
13
403 epidermis and free nerve endings (35,59). Erpeton and Acrochordus These snake lineages Formatted: Font: Italic
404 represent older aquatic transitions in snake phylogeny, and their mechanoreception is linked Formatted: Font: Italic
405 to specialised ambush-predator strategies for hunting ambushing fish prey in turbid
406 freshwater habitats of low visibility (58). In contrast, sea snakes have recent marine origins
407 and are an ecologically very diverse clade comprising: species that variably occupy blue
408 water reefs or turbid inshore habitats, are diurnal or nocturnal, and specialise on active or
409 sedentary prey. The turtle-headed sea snake, Emydocephalus annulatus, is notable in having
410 the second highest scale coverage of sensillascale organs (3.8%) while being diurnally active
411 and specialising on sessile fish eggs in clear water reefs (7,59). Theise results suggestshow as
412 a complex evolutionary history of scale organs and further research should aim to link
413 selection pressures on hydrodynamic reception with particular ecologies (e.g.that optimal Formatted: Font: Italic
414 foraging strategies, water turbidity) may not be the primary selection pressure for
415 hydrodynamic sense in among sea snakes.
416
417 Tail scale organs
418 Based on cellular morphology, there is a clear distinction between cephalic and posteriorly Formatted: Indent: First line: 0 pi
419 located scale sensillaorgans in sea snakes. Scale sensillaorgans present on the tail skin of A.
420 laevis do not contain dermal capsulespapillae; skin elevations are instead created by a
421 thickening of the epidermis (Figure 8A). These structurally ‘simplified’ sensilla
422 structuresscale organs have been reported in studies of the body skin of the sea snake E.
423 annulatus (37) and the tail skin of some terrestrial snakes (10). Many functional roles have
424 been proposed for body scale sensillaorgans in sea snakes, including mechanoreception, sex
425 mate recognition, and enhanced friction for improved swimming performance, gripping
426 and/or ecdysis (7,26,37). We were unable to stain for the presence of free nerve endings in
427 tail scale sensillaorgans, however, nerve staining of ‘supracloacal tubercles’ in the snakes
428 Thamnophis sirtalis and Nerodia rhombifer (formally Natrix rhombifera) found that they
429 were innervated in a similar pattern to cephalic scale sensillaorgans, and thought to be
430 important for sensory feedback to aid alignment of the cloacae position during copulation
431 (10,60). Thus,Although these posteriorly located scale sensillaorgans are exhibit clearly
432 ultrastructural differencestiated compared to from cephalic scale sensillaorgans, it is by their
433 ultrastructure and likely that they have a mechanoreceptive and/or structural functions in sea
434 snakes.
14
435 The ultrastructural differences in cephalic scale sensillaorgans versus posteriorly located Formatted: Font: Italic
436 scale organs may reflect variances variation in mechanoreceptor sensitivity in the head
437 compared to those on the rest of the body. Research in mammals suggests that the structure of
438 the skin organ may be just as important as the neurons that carry the electrical impulse –
439 collagen can provide physical tethering, structural integrity, or aid in propagating or
440 modulating the sensation of force (25). Thus, the absence of a dermal capsulepapilla for scale
441 sensillaorgans on the body and tail skin might indicate a less specialised mechanoreceptor
442 with differential sensitivity compared to a to cephalic mechanoreceptor. Thus, our results
443 support previous studies on terrestrial snakes that suggest that the head of sea snakes is the
444 prime exploratory organ for actively seeking mechanical stimulation (17,27). Future studies
445 should investigate the neural pathways and compare electrophyelectrophysiologicalsical
446 responses underlying scale mechanoreceptors distributed on the head and body of
447 snakes. Such efforts may discover that sea snakes possess specialised nerve pathways and/or
448 responsive fields that are analogous to the cranial nerve canals of neuromasts in fish and
449 amphibians, or the vibrissae of secondarily-aquatic systems in mammals (55,61), which
450 would support a hydrodynamic function for cephalic scale organs.
451
452 Furthermore, cephalic cutaneous receptors are innervated by specialised cranial nerves
453 (e.g. trigeminal ganglion), while the rest of the body is innervated by peripheral nerves of the
454 spinal cord (i.e. dorsal root ganglion) (4). These neural pathways are thought to reflect
455 differences in somatosensory processing wherein the head harbours specialised tactile
456 receptors that are used to actively seek stimuli in the surrounding environment, in contrast to
457 the body, which passively receives information (4,63). Thus, our results suggest that the head
458 of sea snakes is the prime exploratory organ for actively seeking mechanical stimulation.
459 Future studies should investigate the neural pathways and compare electrophysical responses
460 underlying scale mechanoreceptors distributed on the head and body of snakes.
461
462 Dermal photoreception and other cutaneous sensory modalities
463 The skin provides a primary interface for receiving multiple stimuli, creating an opportunity
464 for multi-modal cutaneous receptors. Indeed, molecular and electrophysiological studies of
465 ISOs in crocodiles indicate multi-modal sensitivity to mechanical stimuli and thermal and pH
466 gradients (62,63). Dermal photoreceptors in the tail skin of Aipysurus sea snakes mediate
467 phototactic behaviour in these species (36): we did not detect candidate photoreceptive
468 structures (e.g. photoreceptors, stacked membranes) in the tail skin of A. laevis, but we did Formatted: Font: Not Italic
15
469 find structurally simplified scale organs (described above) and other small dermal papilla
470 (Figure 8B). Given that cutaneous receptors have been linked with both mechano- and
471 photoreception in amphibians (64) and marine invertebrates (65), these scale organs merit
472 further investigation for their putative role in photoreception. Our study (and previous studies
473 using electron microscopy (Chapter 2, Crowe-Riddell et al., 2016; Povel and VanDerKooij,
474 1997) demonstrate that snake scale sensilla are devoid of pores and so a chemosensory
475 function is highly unlikely.
476 Several other sensory functions have been tentatively attributed to the scale organs of Formatted: Indent: First line: 3 pi
477 sea snakes, but these currently lack supporting evidence. An electro-magneto-sense is
478 plausible (5), but our histological sections do not show canals or pores that are indicative of
479 passive electroreceptors (e.g. ampullary-type organs) or specialised active electroreceptive Formatted: Font: Italic
480 organs (e.g. tuberous organs or mormyromasts of weakly-electric fish) (66,67). Similarly, in Formatted: Font: Italic
481 addition to previous studies using electron microscopy (5,7), our study demonstrates that
482 scale organs in sea snakes are devoid of pores and so a chemosensory function is highly
483 unlikely. Baroreception of the changes in air pressure that precede extreme weather events
484 has been attributed to sea kraits, which are an independently marine clade of hydrophiines;
485 however, it is unclear whether sea snakes react in a similar way and how cutaneous
486 mechanoreceptors might transduce pressure information in sea snakes or sea kraits. Salinity is
487 an important predictor of sea snake distribution (68) because many most species require
488 access to freshwater for hydration (69–71), but pH receptors are more likely to be located in
489 papillae in the mouth (11,72). The thermal sensitivity of scale sensillaorgans has been
490 investigated in Elaphe colubroid (Elaphe) snakes with results indicating, which found that Formatted: Font: Not Italic
491 although some cutaneous nerves are exclusively sensitive to heat, mechanoreceptive fibres
492 are not responsive to either heating or cooling (17,73). Dermal photoreceptors in the tail skin
493 of Aipysurus sea snakes mediate phototactic behaviour in these species. Although we did not
494 detect candidate photoreceptive structures (e.g. photoreceptors, lenses) in the tail skin of A.
495 laevis, we did find ‘simplified’ scale sensilla (described above) and other small dermal
496 capsule (Figure 8B). Given that cutaneous receptors have been linked with both mechano-
497 and photoreception in amphibians (69) and marine invertebrates (70), these scale organs
498 merit further investigation for their putative role in photoreception. Finally, these sensory
499 hypotheses do not exclude other non-sensory functions for scale organs, e.g. modifying Formatted: Font: Italic
500 boundary layer of skin, so these roles should be considered in future studies in the scale
501 organs of sea snakes.
502 Finally, an electro-magneto-sense has been proposed for scale sensilla in snakes (5),
16
503 but our understanding of the spatial ecology, and thus long-range navigation abilities, of sea
504 snakes is limited.
505 Conclusions
506 Our study shows that the ultrastructure of cephalic sensillascale organs of in sea snakes
507 closely resembles the mechanosensitive Meissner-like corpuscles that underlie the scale
508 sensillaorgans inof terrestrial snakes. This provides evidence that the sensillascale organs of
509 marine hydrophiines lineages have retained an ancestral mechanosensory function. Our
510 findings provide the basis for future research into the sensitivity of cutaneous receptors in sea
511 snakes including mechano-, hydro- and photo-sensory modalities. Our study highlights that
512 snakes are an important group for understanding the evolution of mechanoreception in
513 vertebrates, particularly in response to shifting sensory landscapes.
