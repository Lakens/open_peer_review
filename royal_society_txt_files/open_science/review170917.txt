Manuscript title:
“Curcumin improves glycolipid metabolism through regulating PPAR<U+03B3> signaling pathway in
high-fat diet induced obese mice and 3T3-L1 adipocytes”
Comments:
This original article has evaluated the effects of curcumin on glycolipid metabolism through
regulating PPAR<U+03B3> signaling pathway in high-fat diet induced obese mice and 3T3-L1
adipocytes.
Please consider my suggestions:
• The article appears to be understandable to readers.
• HDL and LDL should be rewritten as HDL-C (high dence lipoproteine cholesterol) and LDL-C
(low dence lipoproteine cholesterol) all the text long.
• It is necessary that the author conform the manuscript as mentioned in Instructions to Authors.
• Authors should add the number of the mice used in each group all the text figures.
• Authors should add the explanations of abbreviations whenever used first time all the text long
.For example what is the "WAT", it must be as: the white adipose tissue (WAT) for the first time.
• Authors should discuss the limitation of the present study.
• Please add some other related papers to discission such as: Zhou, Yajun, et al. "The interruption
of the PDGF and EGF signaling pathways by curcumin stimulates gene expression of PPAR
[gamma] in rat activated hepatic stellate cell in vitro." Laboratory investigation 87.5 (2007): 488.
So, we recommend this article for publication in the Royal Society Open Science after revision
including mentioned comments.

Pan et al. examined the effects of a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, curcumin, in regulating
glycolipid metabolism in both mouse and adipocyte cell culture models. The authors observed
that administration of curcumin reduced body weight, lowed the blood glucose and serum lipid
profiles and improved insulin sensitivity in obese mice induced by high fat diet. Moreover, the
authors also observed PPARr signaling signature changes under curcumin administration in both
obese mice and 3T3-L1 cells, which is depending on the doses of curcumin. Based on these
observations the authors conclude that curcumin may hold treatment potential for obesity and
diabetes. Overall the presented data were supportive to the major conclusions but there are some
concerns need to be addressed before its publication.
Major concerns:
1. Overall the manuscript is lacking of the detailed description of how many mice were used in
each experimental group to achieve the statistical significance, including Figure 2, 3 and 4.
2. Fig. 3b and 3b: Statistical tests are needed.
3. Fig. 5b: The wester blotting analyses need to be quantified. Does these protein expressions
correlate with mRNA expressions?
4. Fig. 7: Why the higher dose (35 uM) of curcumin does not suppress mRNA expression but
protein expression of C/EBPa and PPARr?
Minor concerns:
The reviewer suggests the authors to thoroughly read through the manuscript to eliminate typos
and grammar mistakes.

Reviewer #1:
1. HDL and LDL should be rewritten as HDL-C (high dence lipoproteine
cholesterol) and LDL-C (low dence lipoproteine cholesterol) all the text long.
Response: We thank this review for her/his valuable comments. We have
corrected the issues according to your suggestion in our revised manuscript
(highlighted with green color).
2. It is necessary that the author conform the manuscript as mentioned in
Instructions to Authors. Authors should add the number of the mice used in each
group all the text figures.
Response: According to your comments we have declare that all authors conform
the manuscript in Instruction to Authors. In addition, we have added the number of the
mice used in each group (10 samples per group were taken for each assay) to make it
understandable in our revised manuscript (highlighted with green color)
3. Authors should add the explanations of abbreviations whenever used first time
all the text long .For example what is the "WAT", it must be as: the white adipose
tissue (WAT) for the first time.
Response: Correction about the explanations of abbreviations have been made.
In detail, we have added adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive
lipase (HSL), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor <U+F067>/<U+F061>(PPAR <U+F067>/<U+F061>),
CCAAT/enhancer binding protein<U+F061> (C/EBP<U+F061>), the white adipose tissue (WAT),
triglyceride (TG) kits were obtained from Beijing Leadman Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Beijing,
China). Assay kits for total cholesterol (TC), low dence lipoproteine cholesterol (LDL-C)
and high dence lipoproteine cholesterol (HDL-C), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for
the first time according to your suggestion in our revised manuscript (highlighted with
green color).
4. Authors should discuss the limitation of the present study.
Response: Limitation of the current study have been added to section of
discussion as “But high dose (35 µM) of curcumin did not significantly upregulate the
protein expression of PPAR<U+03B3> and C / EBPa in 3T3-L1 cells. We hypothesize that
35µM curcumin may have an effect on the activity of some enzymes in the process of
translating into proteins, so further study and discussions are deserved to be explored
in the future.” in our revised manuscript (highlighted with green color)..
5. Please add some other related papers to discussion such as: Zhou, Yajun, et al.
"The interruption of the PDGF and EGF signaling pathways by curcumin stimulates
gene expression of PPAR [gamma] in rat activated hepatic stellate cell in vitro."
Laboratory investigation 87.5 (2007): 488.
Response: As this reference is helpful for revising and improving our paper. We
have already added this reference according to your suggestion in our revised
manuscript (highlighted with green color).
Moreover, Zhou, et al. showed that curcumin stimulates gene expression of proliferator
activated receptor <U+F067> (PPAR<U+F067>) in activated hepatic stellate cell and interrupted PDGF and EGF
signaling[21].
Special thanks to you for your good comments.
Reviewer #2:
1. Overall the manuscript is lacking of the detailed description of how many mice
were used in each experimental group to achieve the statistical significance, including
Figure 2, 3 and 4.
Response: According to your comments we have declare that all authors conform
the manuscript in Instructions to Authors. In addition, we have added the number of
the mice used in each group in Fig. 2, 3 and 4 to make it understandable in our revised
manuscript (highlighted with green color).
2. Fig. 3b and 3d: Statistical tests are needed.
Response: Thanks for your careful review and professional suggestion. We have
corrected the statistic tests in HFD and HFD+Cur group in Fig. 3b and 3d according
to your suggestion in our revised Fig.3.
3. Fig. 5b: The wester blotting analyses need to be quantified. Does these protein
expressions correlate with mRNA expressions?
Response: Thanks for your careful review and professional suggestion. We have
added the quantification figures of western blotting analyses in in Fig.5b and Fig.7b
according to your suggestion in our revised manuscript.
4. Fig. 7: Why the higher dose (35 uM) of curcumin does not suppress mRNA
expression but protein expression of C/EBP<U+F061> and PPARr?
Response: Thanks for your professional question. We hypothesize that high dose
(35<U+F06D>M) of curcumin may have an effect on the activity of some enzymes in the
process of translating into proteins, thus affecting the expression of C/EBP<U+F061> and
PPAR<U+F067>. Our subsequent experiments show that 35<U+F06D>M curcumin inhibits the
expression of these proteins, which will further study and discussion in the future.
