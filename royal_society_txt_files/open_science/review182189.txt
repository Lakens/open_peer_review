This is a well-written and clear manuscript applying data-driven computational methods to
reveal the facial features that correlate with perceptions of attractiveness. While these methods
have been used to model various social perceptions, they have never been applied to East Asian
faces and East Asian observers. Given cross-cultural differences in perception and cognition, this
is an important contribution. It further showcases the utility and discovery value of data-driven
methods.
The work was solid and the results straightforward. It was surprising to find out that for male
faces, the texture properties making them more attractive are lighter; this is the opposite finding
for Caucasian male faces in Said and Todorov. But this is part of the value of data-driven
methods. This cross-cultural difference is worth exploring in the future.
There is another recent paper (on the open science framework) that uses the same approach. It
would be good to acknowledge this work (https://osf.io/jurcq/). As in Said and Todorov, this
group worked with Caucasian faces, but real (female) faces. The three papers taken together
demonstrate the value of data-driven approaches.

This study attempted to fill a gap in the facial attractiveness literature through its use of a large
set of images of computer-generated male and female East Asian faces and through attractiveness
3
judgments of these faces by East Asian perceivers. The study was exploratory, data-driven (i.e.,
bottom-up), and sought to determine the extent to which facial shape and facial surface
contribute to the attractiveness judgments.
The authors examined the relative contributions of facial shape and facial surface on
attractiveness judgments of faces. These two factors need to be discussed in greater depth as it is
unclear what each exactly signifies. For example, does facial surface refer to the darkness and
color characteristics of the skins of the faces? This seems to be the case when looking at Figure 1.
If so, why don’t the authors just call it darkness and color? The word “surface” is misleading
because it denotes texture, blemishes, etc. which the authors acknowledge not including as
factors in the study.
The participants rated the faces for attractiveness on a 9-point scale. It would be helpful for the
readers if some descriptive statistics regarding these ratings are provided. Figure 2 shows some
of these data, but the raw values could help especially when considering the present findings in
light of those of previous studies.
One of the main findings of the study is “that bigger eyes, smaller noses, and brighter skin in
both male and female faces lead to an increase in perceived attractiveness.” What specific analysis
led to this conclusion? Is it based merely on an examination of the faces presented in Figure 1, or
are there quantitative values to support this? Perhaps I missed something but this is not clear.
Finally, I would like to push the authors’ approach a bit further. The data-driven approach
showed some interesting findings. However, would it not make scientific sense to also have
included a hypothesis-driven component that used the East-Asian faces to test whether classic
facial attractiveness effects would obtain for these faces? If the issue is that only Caucasian faces
have been used, then the first step should have been to use the East-Asian faces to try to replicate
previous studies. Then extend this by using the data-driven approach.

The revised version of the manuscript is an improvement from the initial version. The use of
"facial reflectance" is less misleading and more appropriately reflects what the authors examined.
The authors also now make clear why they employed a data-driven instead of a hypothesis-
driven approach. The table of attractiveness ratings data is a nice addition. Overall, I believe that
the revision addressed the issues that were previously raised.

March 19, 2019
Dear Editor at Royal Society Open Science:
We are grateful to have the opportunity to revise our manuscript entitled, “Data-driven
mathematical model of East-Asian facial attractiveness: The relative contributions of facial
shape and surface to attractiveness judgments” (Manuscript ID RSOS-182189), which has
been reviewed for publication in Royal Society Open Science. Please find our revised
manuscript, including three figures and one table. We revised our manuscript in accordance
with two reviewers’ comments. First, we used the word “facial reflectance” instead of
“surface” in our revised manuscript to appropriately describe our results that facial colour and
brightness are important cues to attractiveness. Accordingly, we changed the title of our
manuscript into “Data-driven mathematical model of East-Asian facial attractiveness: The
relative contributions of shape and reflectance to attractiveness judgements” and provided a
definition of facial shape and reflectance in Introduction in the revised manuscript. Second, we
presented the faces transformed along the attractiveness dimension extremely (i.e., -10 SD and
+10 SD) in Figure 1 to illustrate more clearly how facial features vary with attractiveness.
These exaggerated faces were not used in the experiment, but it would be helpful for readers to
visually appreciate facial cues to attractiveness. We would be glad if our revisions satisfy the
reviewers’ essential suggestions.
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Koyo Nakamura

Response to Referees
To Reviewer #1:
We appreciate your helpful comments on our manuscript. According to your suggestion,
we checked the article in OSF (Holzleitner et al., 2018), and found that the study
applied the data-driven approach to real Caucasian female faces in order to reveal
important components in perception of facial attractiveness. We think this article
deserves to be cited in our manuscript to discuss the value of the data-driven
computational modeling (lines 83-86, 103-106).
To Reviewer #2:
We appreciate your helpful comments for important issues in this article. As we
described below, we revised our manuscript according to your comments. We hope this
revise meets your requests appropriately.
Reviewer’s comment 1)
Reviewer #1 noted “The authors examined the relative contributions of facial shape and
facial surface on attractiveness judgments of faces. These two factors need to be
discussed in greater depth as it is unclear what each exactly signifies. For example, does
facial surface refer to the darkness and color characteristics of the skins of the faces?
This seems to be the case when looking at Figure 1. If so, why don’t the authors just call
it darkness and color? The word “surface” is misleading because it denotes texture,
blemishes, etc. which the authors acknowledge not including as factors in the study.
Authors’ response:
As Reviewer #2 pointed out, the word “facial surface” might be misleading for
readers because the word conjures only skin properties such as “blemish” and
“skin smoothness.” Therefore, we are convinced to use another word to signify
multiple facial features such as brightness, colours, texture variation on the skin
surface, which covary with attractiveness. In Todorov and his colleague’s studies
using face stimuli generated by the FaceGen, the word “reflectance” has been used
instead of “surface.” It is defined as including facial properties such as “brightness,
color, and texture variations on the surface map of the faces” (Todorov and
Oosterhof, 2011). Given the consistency between the previous data-driven studies
and the current study, we replace “surface” with “reflectance” throughout our
revised manuscript with a detailed definition of “reflectance” given by Todorov
and Oosterhof (2011). Thus, we have added the statements for defining facial
shape and reflectance in Introduction with necessary references (lines 115 - 121).
Reviewer’s comment 2)
Reviewer #2 noted “The participants rated the faces for attractiveness on a 9-point scale.
It would be helpful for the readers if some descriptive statistics regarding these ratings
are provided. Figure 2 shows some of these data, but the raw values could help
especially when considering the present findings in light of those of previous studies. “
Authors’ response:
As Reviewer #2 suggested, it would be helpful to present descriptive statistics of
facial attractiveness rating in order for readers to compare the present results with
previous ones and to replicate our findings. In our revised manuscript, we reported
mean score, standard deviation, range (min and max) of facial attractiveness
ratings in Table 1 (lines 207-208).
Reviewer’s comment 3)
Reviewer #2 noted “One of the main findings of the study is “that bigger eyes, smaller
noses, and brighter skin in both male and female faces lead to an increase in perceived
attractiveness.” What specific analysis led to this conclusion? Is it based merely on an
examination of the faces presented in Figure 1, or are there quantitative values to
support this? Perhaps I missed something but this is not clear. “
Authors’ response:
In the data-driven approach, facial features driving attractiveness were identified
through a mathematical calculation. More precisely, “t” (line 214) in our revised
manuscript represents how facial features vary on the attractiveness dimension. For
readers, however, the 100 dimensional vector “t” seems unmeaningful so that we
visualized how facial features were changed when “t” was changed. In revised
Figure 1, we presented the faces with extreme changed of “t” (-10SD and +10SD)
to help readers visually appreciate which features vary along the attractiveness
dimension. A similar technique was used in Oosterhof & Todorov (2008). Thus,
we also stated in a footnote that our conclusion is based on visualization of the
attractiveness vector “t” (line 542-544).
Reviewer’s comment 4)
Reviewer #2 noted “Finally, I would like to push the authors’ approach a bit further. The
data-driven approach showed some interesting findings. However, would it not make
scientific sense to also have included a hypothesis-driven component that used the
East-Asian faces to test whether classic facial attractiveness effects would obtain for
these faces? If the issue is that only Caucasian faces have been used, then the first step
should have been to use the East-Asian faces to try to replicate previous studies. Then
extend this by using the data-driven approach.“
Authors’ response:
As Reviewer #2 commented, the first step to examine cultural differences in
attractiveness judgements could be to take a hypothesis-driven approach to Western and
non-Western cultures. As we stated in our revised manuscript, the hypothesis-driven
studies have revealed that some facial cues to attractiveness such as the sexual
dimorphism and symmetry affect attractiveness judgements universally across Western
and non-Western cultures including Asian countries (lines 72-75, 107-110). Although
the hypothesis-driven approach has emphasized the universality of perception of facial
attractiveness and the idea was true to some extent, the data-driven approach has a
potential to identify as yet unidentified facial cues that have not reported yet in the
hypothesis-driven approach. This was the reason why we performed the data-driven
computational modeling for East-Asian faces for the first time. To make clear this point,
we stated the values and contributions of both hypothesis-driven and data-driven
approaches in Conclusion section (lines 383-393).
