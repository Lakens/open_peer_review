Dear editor,
I have reviewed the paper “Assortative mating frames establishment in a young island bird
population.” The manuscript is well written and the methods are nicely explained. I am also
impressed by the amount of work; genotyping no less than 630 individuals. However, I do have
some comments and suggestions regarding the methods applied to analyze the genetic data.
First, the STRUCTURE analysis is based on all loci and all individuals. Using this complete
dataset can potentially bias the results. Several loci deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
while STRUCTURE assumes that loci within populations are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (see
introduction of STRUCTURE manual). Next, the analysis of related individuals can cause
estimation biases because of shared variation that consequently affects the ancestry analysis (see
for example Porras-Hurtado et al. 2013 Frontiers in Genetics). Given that the authors have
sampled almost the entire island population; the dataset likely contains several related
individuals. I would suggest removing these individuals and rerunning the analyses. You could
remove related individuals with ML-related (Kalinowski et al. 2006 Molecular Ecology Notes).
Removing related individuals might also solve the issues with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
Alternatively, the analyses can be done with the software package CLUSTER_DIST which does
not make Hardy–Weinberg assumptions and can deal with related individuals (Rodriguez-
Ramilo et al. 2014 Genetics Research).
During the quantification of population differentiation (using Fst and Dest), the samples are
divided over six groups. Why did you not pool all the island samples (resident island [>20 obs],
resident island [<20 obs] and nestlings)?
Based on the observed heterozygosity values, the authors conclude that there are no signs of a
founder effect. Although I agree with this reasoning, this statement can be tested statistically. One
could for example use the software BOTTLENECK, which checks if there has been a significant
decrease in allelic richness (Cornuet & Luikart 1997 Genetics).
The supplementary material contains simulations of admixture to test particular colonization
scenarios. This analyses culminated in the following sentence: “neither scenario resulted in a
comparable pattern than the clearly distinct distribution of genotypes in island offspring
observed.” Hence, I do not see the point of including these simulations in the manuscript.
Normally, one would simulate several scenarios and compare the output with the actual data
using a goodness-of-fit test. The scenario that most closely matches the data gives some insights
into the possible history of the population. I would suggest that either the authors remove the
simulations from the paper or they perform a more detailed analyses with statistical validation.

The authors have nicely addressed all my concerns. They performed extra analyses to show that
the deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium did not affect the STRUCTURE analyses. And
they added a statistical procedure to the simulations. Although I would have liked a statistical
test of a potential bottleneck, I understand that this was not feasible with the present data set. I
think this manuscript is almost ready for publication. I did, however, find a few minor mistakes
in the text (see below). Notably, the results section switches between past and present tense. This

Comments to the Author(s)
Dear editor,
I have reviewed the paper “Assortative mating frames establishment in a
young island bird population.” The manuscript is well written and the
methods are nicely explained. I am also impressed by the amount of work;
genotyping no less than 630 individuals. However, I do have some comments
and suggestions regarding the methods applied to analyze the genetic data.
We would like to thank the reviewer in providing a highly valuable and
constructive review on our work. We think this critical evaluation
substantially improved the work. We provide detailed responses following
each paragraph.
First, the STRUCTURE analysis is based on all loci and all individuals.
Using this complete dataset can potentially bias the results. Several loci
deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium while STRUCTURE assumes that loci
within populations are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (see introduction of
STRUCTURE manual). Next, the analysis of related individuals can cause
estimation biases because of shared variation that consequently affects the
ancestry analysis (see for example Porras-Hurtado et al. 2013 Frontiers in
Genetics). Given that the authors have sampled almost the entire island
population; the dataset likely contains several related individuals. I
would suggest removing these individuals and rerunning the analyses. You
could remove related individuals with ML-related (Kalinowski et al. 2006
Molecular Ecology Notes). Removing related individuals might also solve the
issues with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Alternatively, the analyses can be
done with the software package CLUSTER_DIST which does not make Hardy–
Weinberg assumptions and can deal with related individuals (Rodriguez-
Ramilo et al. 2014 Genetics Research).
We thank the reviewer pointing to this crucial aspect. We were aware of the
potential bias included by very related individuals. This was partly the
reason why we separated individuals with a high record history (i.e. the
“residents island >20”) with those of low record history and nestlings.
Regarding Structure, we – however – haven’t done a separate run including
only individuals from groups showing no HWE deviations (namely migrants,
mainland birds and resident >20 individuals). We did now. As you will see
in the figure below, the changes from the reduced dataset with the full
dataset are only marginal and strongest for the very few individuals with
very insecure assignments.
Therefore, we are confident that the full dataset - while including
siblings – will not affect results in a dramatic way so that the
conclusions drawn remain unaffected. We now added more information why
splitting the island residents into subgroups and also added our reduced
structure analysis for full transparency to the reader. While we certainly
could add this figure also to the appendix, we decided against because we
deem it not necessary as it does not contribute to the main study question.
We keep the reporting of all resident subgroups including all nestlings, as
we wanted to know the assignment of each individual and hence the fraction
to which these clusters are represented at each population level.
During the quantification of population differentiation (using Fst and
Dest), the samples are divided over six groups. Why did you not pool all
the island samples (resident island [>20 obs], resident island [<20 obs]
and nestlings)?
As we already explained in the method section (which is now expanded and
clarified), we wanted to ensure that we did not wrongly assign birds as
“resident” what were color banded but left the island (i.e. migrant or
vagrant) or regularly return to it for unknown reasons apart from
reproduction. Also this separation ensured the reduction of closely related
individuals as shown in the HWE results in Table 2. So we applied this
division to all analyses. Hence, comparing the population differentiation
(and assignment) should be safest when using the “residents island >20”
birds. Indeed, if comparing the general outcomes of the three different
cohorts of island birds with migrants or mainland populations the general
conclusions remain the same (i.e. island bird differ more from migrants
than mainland populations). Yet, there is slight variation between
residents with <20 observations to nestlings and those with >20
observations in both differentiation and assignment to other populations
which is worth further investigation. Pooling all samples (for all the
reasons explained above) could affect the general outcome or at least add
more variation we can better handle (and explain) using the separated
cohorts.
Based on the observed heterozygosity values, the authors conclude that
there are no signs of a founder effect. Although I agree with this
reasoning, this statement can be tested statistically. One could for
example use the software BOTTLENECK, which checks if there has been a
significant decrease in allelic richness (Cornuet & Luikart 1997 Genetics).
We initially thought of using Bottleneck or an M-ratio test to
statistically prove the presence/absence of a founder effect. However, the
utility of these methods is restricted and we see a high chance of
erroneous results using them due to a lack of power in both the number of
individuals (focusing on unrelated island bird) and microsatellites used
here (see Peery et al. 2012 and Hoban et al. 2013 for an extensive
discussion). Because of this, we decided to restrict the investigation of a
potential founder effect to its discussion based on the observed
heterozygosities and refrain from explicit (and testable) hypotheses of
this topic.
The supplementary material contains simulations of admixture to test
particular colonization scenarios. This analyses culminated in the
following sentence: “neither scenario resulted in a comparable pattern than
the clearly distinct distribution of genotypes in island offspring
observed.” Hence, I do not see the point of including these simulations in
the manuscript. Normally, one would simulate several scenarios and compare
the output with the actual data using a goodness-of-fit test. The scenario
that most closely matches the data gives some insights into the possible
history of the population. I would suggest that either the authors remove
the simulations from the paper or they perform a more detailed analyses
with statistical validation.
We agree that we should have added a statistical procedure to quantify the
outcome of the simulation apart from a descriptive explanation. Hence, we
added a comparison based on the unpaired mean difference of assignment
probabilities between the island nestlings and each scenario. For each
comparison a bootstrap confidence interval based on 5000 iterations is
calculated. For the revision, we also redraw Figure S1 in order to better
illustrate the differences and their significance. The simulation is of
high importance to proof that the absence of admixture in island nestlings
is not a matter of random mating of existing genotypes stemming from
different sources.

Yes. This sentence mentions the INITIAL colonization that was initiated by
a single breeding pair (see previous sentence). Hence, a large number of
putative propagules would have led to a higher number of breeding pairs in
the initial colonization of the island, which is not supported by the data
documenting the population development of the Helgolandian blackbirds (see
refs 18,32 in the manuscript).

Line 188-190: How do your measures of genetic divergence relate to other
studies on island populations? It would be interesting to compare your Fst-
values with previous studies.
We totally agree that this would be very interesting. However we think that
such a comparison would go beyond the scope of our paper. This is mainly
because island-mainland differentiation in other avian systems might be
affected by a lot of different factors such as: 1) island size and 2)
distance to the mainland, 3) general mobility of the species (i.e.
migratory, sedentary), 4) functional resistance of water bodies as
perceived by the species, 5) time since colonization of the island, 6)
functional connectivity (i.e. effective migration), etc. Such a comparison
could be subject of a (very interesting) review. Hence, in order to not
selectively pick studies that confirm our findings – which would generate a
skewed impression - we prefer to not include more studies apart from our
species-specific expectations. Yet, to clarify the used references, we
mentioned our study species here.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a very clear paper. I would only like to see more named examples
elaborated on in Discussion (and Introduction) apart from one Zosterops and
Darwin's finches.
We would like to thank the reviewer for the constructive feedback.
Regarding the general comment of using more examples, we already have
included examples from barn swallow, melodious warbler, purple martin,
house finch and forest thrush in the introduction and discussion.
Mentioning all the species explicitly in the text would introduce too much
distracting, review-like, information which is not of immediate relevance
to the manuscript or to support any of the findings. In saying that, we
revised the introduction and discussion in that we did not explicitly
mention other species anymore while references remain. We found that this
revision streamlines the manuscript and improved the reading.

Since this is meant as an outlook rather than a concrete result from this

Nevertheless, we know from available data from this population that many
island birds have very round wings and variation in song parameters. This
variation poses interesting opportunities to relate these data with our
genetic findings. Hence, we add some more details in the final paragraph of
the manuscript where we seize the idea again and cite a study on
morphological and song variation in the island population.

Appendix B
Dear Editor,
Thanks once more for the neat review process. With a vacation-related delay
I have now incorporated the final minor edits into the manuscript. Since
there is no major concern we simply agreed with everything the reviewer
suggested including a thorough check of the tense in the results section.
On behalf of all coauthors I’m much looking forward receiving the proofs of
the manuscript.
Kind regards,
Jan Engler et al.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have nicely addressed all my concerns. They performed extra
analyses to show that the deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium did
not affect the STRUCTURE analyses. And they added a statistical procedure
to the simulations. Although I would have liked a statistical test of a
potential bottleneck, I understand that this was not feasible with the
present data set. I think this manuscript is almost ready for publication.
I did, however, find a few minor mistakes in the text (see below). Notably,
the results section switches between past and present tense. This can
easily be corrected.
Dear Reviewer,
We would like to thank you for your fair and constructive evaluation. We
accounted for all remaining issues, so there will be no line-specific
responses necessary.
Sincerely,
Jan Engler et al.
