This study examines the effect of past and current experience on oviposition site choice of two
species of spider mites. Understanding how current and past experience affect behaviours,
particularly those linked to reproductive fitness, is an area of intense interest in the literature.
This empirical paper contributes to an understanding of whether and how invertebrates can
‘titrate’ risk versus benefit in light of information that might predict contextual determinants of
behavior-fitness links. In the main species studied here (Tetranychus kanzawai) the authors
examined how oviposition site choice was affected by past experience with conspecific eggs, or
eggs and (egg) predators, and effects of the presence of male or female conspecifics at the time of
oviposition. They also examine responses of an ecologically distinct conspecific (T. urticae) to past
experience with eggs and (egg) predators. They test the idea that mite oviposition location
should shift in response to experience with predators, since this indicates a higher risk of laying
where eggs are more vulnerable to predation (on leaves) even though the safer substrate (on
webs) has costs in terms of offspring feeding. They also test the idea that this can be moderated
by other factors, including the presence of conspecific eggs on the leaf (which they assume would
lead to dilution of predation risk), or the presence of conspecifics themselves.
As predicted, they show that these invertebrates increase relative oviposition rates on safe (web)
versus vulnerable (leaf) substrates in response to experience with (egg) predators, and that the
duration of these effects is more sustained in the species in which predation is a more constant
risk in nature (T. kanzawai). Moreover, their results for T. kanzawai suggest that oviposition
behaviour may be affected by both past and current indicators of conspecific presence
(past:conspecific egg presence on leaves; present: adult males on leaves). These results join a
body of literature showing that invertebrates, despite relatively simple nervous systems, are able
to integrate past experience in future behavioural choices, with examples now present in
behaviors as diverse as mate choice, foraging and aggressive behaviours.
I found this manuscript a pleasure to read.The writing was clear. The methods were elegant,
based on well-established natural history/biology of these mites, and nicely targeted at their
hypotheses. Data analyses are straightforward for the most part, and the data clearly displayed.
Inferences are supported by the data for the most part (see a couple of queries in the Discussion).
My main critiques are:
1. The introduction does not contain sufficient information to justify the conspecific presence
treatments, and thus there are no specific predictions about the effects of these treatments (other
than they could moderate effects of predator presence). The result is that this looks like a ‘fishing
expedition’ until the discussion. (lines 54-57 are insufficient and the example in parentheses is
given with no context).
My suggestion is that the introduction should include more explicitly the costs and benefits of
female laying on leaves vs. web and then the factors that could affect that balance (including that
laying on webs has a cost in terms of offspring feeding). This should be stated in general terms
regarding how information about the relative strength of costs/benefits may be available and
change behavioural choices. So predation information predicts more laying on webs, but dilution
effects mean that any indication of conspecifics laying eggs on leaves leads to focal females
choosing to lay on leaves more frequently. Thus, clearly, presence of eggs (current or past) would
provide this information. Current presence of males may also give this information if typically,
males co-occur with mated females. The authors may or may not predict this will be different
3
from responses to the presence of nymphs. I think this approach would more directly integrate
the two treatments in the justification for the study.
2. Although explained more in the discussion, it is not entirely clear to me how the presence of
males on leaves may be expected to affect female decisions independent of indicating presence of
conspecifics. E.g., do females typically remate over this time period, might they stay on leaves
(and thus oviposit there ) to maintain access to males etc.?
Other considerations that may improve the manuscript:
3. Abstract: last sentence (lines 26-28); here you emphasize how these effects are due to ‘multiple
stimuli from conspecifics and predators’; I am not sure that has been demonstrated. For example,
this could be mediated entirely by chemical cues of eggs and males (this is an extreme
example)—so would it not be better here to emphasize how shifts/learning arise from multiple
sources of information (e.g., past and present interactions).
4. Lines 111-112, suggested change: Individuals of a specialist predatory mite Neoseiulus
womersleyi **were used in our experiments**. These are a common natural enemy of 112
tetranychid mites that can penetrate their prey species’ webs [22], **but** eat more eggs on…
5. Line 138-139. Suggested change: Then, **an equal number of** T. kanzawai males were
introduced onto the leaf…
6. lines 148-149. How were new eggs quantified in the eggs+ treatment? Were all eggs counted
prior to introduction of focal females?
7. line 174. Why are sample sizes almost double in experiment 3 relative to other experiments?
8. lines 184-185 and results. Since all GLM’s are listed with a distribution, I assume GLM here
refers to Generalized Linear Models (rather than general linear model?). Please specify on first
use of the abbreviation.
9. Figures: Are error bars = standard error throughout?
10. line 229. Can you set the context by starting this paragraph with:
In the absence of a predator experience, T. urticae females lay almost all of their eggs on the leaf
(fig. 6).
11. line 229-230. Here please refer to proportion of eggs specifically to be consistent with the
figure (figure 6a).’…female laid a higher proportion of their eggs on the web…’
12. Lines 232-233. Suggested change:
The total number of eggs/female laid over 4 days was not significantly different in the two
predator experience treatments (p=0.0885; GLM; threat+:threat- was 33.29±1.98:37.30±1.79).
13 Discussion. Please start this section with a few statements that summarize all of your results in
terms of the original hypotheses and any new insights, then go on to discuss each one in more
detail. For example:
We have demonstrated that both past experience and current interactions affect oviposition site
selection in Tetranychus mites. Our work suggests that oviposition site is affected by information
bout predation threat and the presence of conspecifics….etc.
14. Lines 255-256. Not clear to me what this means—laid more eggs on leaf surface compared to
web, or more on leaf then threat + females? Please specify comparison. If what is meant is more
on leaf compared to web for threat- females, then this technically requires a test not yet done (e.g,
the % laid on webs among threat- females versus expectation of 50%).
15. Lines 276-277. Not clear to me which data show more hurried egg laying by threat+ T
kanzawai females. I see a difference in number of eggs laid only on day 3 (figure 4b).
16. Lines 279-283. Same query as above for lines 255-256. What is the comparator here?
17. Lines 286-293. Some of this information would have been useful in the introduction and/or
methods to explain why it is important to focus on total number of eggs a well as proportion, and
also the relevance of male presence as a treatment.

Manuscript: “Behavioural flexibility in spider mites: oviposition site shifts based on past and
present stimuli from conspecifics and predators”
ID: RSOS-170328
Summary:
The authors are interested in flexible oviposition in T. kanzawai spider mites in response to
predator cues and the presence of conspecific eggs. They hypothesize that a dilution effect of
laying eggs with other conspecific eggs on the leaf surface could be more effective at preventing
predation than laying eggs on the predator-protected web, possibly explaining why more eggs
are generally laid on the leaf surface. Several experiments are performed to test if 1) the presence
of conspecific eggs leads to higher prevalence of eggs laid on the leaf surface, 2) additional
experience with a predator cue induces a shift to laying more eggs on the web, 3) the presence of
live conspecific males or females after a predator cue induces a shift back to laying more eggs on
the leaf surface, and 4) if two different species with different predation history show different
oviposition behavior. They found that the presence of conspecific eggs leads to increased
oviposition on the leaf surface rather than the web, but that females shift to laying more eggs on
the web with both conspecific egg and predator cues. T. urticae, which has an evolutionary
history with lower predation than T. kanzawai, seems to show a similar pattern, but the shift
does not last as long. Finally, T. kanzawai cohabiting with live males but not females after
exposure to a predator cue seemed to reduce the amount of eggs laid on the web compared to
being alone. Flexible and dynamic oviposition behavior in response to different cues is
highlighted as a major result of the manuscript.
The authors chose a very promising study system that seems to have much to offer in terms of
testing hypotheses about flexible oviposition behavior. They use relevant conspecific and
predator cues to address their question of why more eggs are generally laid on the leaf surface
despite an apparent benefit of protection from predators when eggs are laid on the web instead.
The overarching idea of a trade-off between direct protection from predators afforded by laying
eggs on the web and indirect protection via a dilution effect on the leaf surface is an interesting
5
question. However, there are many different ideas in this manuscript that don’t always seem to
fit together well. In addition, some clarification would be helpful with regard to the
question/hypothesis and why the authors chose to do the specific experiments described here.
The most important findings (and how they relate to the hypothesis) should also be highlighted
more clearly in the discussion. Some suggestions for strengthening the manuscript are detailed
below.
Major comments:
1. There seem to be several different ideas in this manuscript, and it is not always clear how they
fit together. The current main focus of the manuscript seems to be on responses to predator cues,
but the ideas of conspecific cues and predator-related evolutionary history of different species
also come up. In this version of the manuscript, I think that these additional ideas make it
difficult to identify the main point of the paper. If the authors want to leave all three ideas in the
paper, then I have two specific suggestions: 1) the introduction should be re-written to better
introduce all of the ideas and explain how they are related, and 2) the authors should state a focal
question/problem that encompasses all of the ideas. Flexibility in oviposition is a broad topic,
and the manuscript would benefit from a more focused question relating to the cues the authors
focused on.
In particular, more weight should be given to conspecific cues than is currently in the
introduction, since many of the experiments (and the discussion) are about effects of conspecific
cues on oviposition. For example, the introduction could easily be re-written to focus on the
interplay and trade-offs between predator cues and conspecific cues, instead of the current focus
which is mainly on predator cues. If I understand correctly, predator cues should induce
oviposition on the web, while conspecific cues should induce oviposition on the leaf surface- both
for protection from predators. In the wild, females likely encounter both cues, so what do they do
in that case? Which cues are prioritized when both are present? To me, this is the most novel
contribution of the manuscript. It would be an interesting and broadly-applicable way of framing
the introduction, and it would set the stage for the following experiments more clearly. In
addition, the current hypothesis is that “in T. kanzawai mites, dilution effect of their aggregation
on their host plant could have larger utility than reducing the predation risk of eggs laid on the
leaf surface.” It may be appropriate to re-word the hypothesis, because this study does not
directly demonstrate the dilution effect in this particular system. The study only examines how
different cues affect oviposition behavior; it does not measure survival or predation of eggs
with/without predators after oviposition, and thus does not demonstrate the presence or
adaptiveness of a dilution effect.
Some specific suggestions for changes are below, but my overall suggestion would be to change
the framework of the introduction (and abstract) to better introduce the main
question/hypothesis and what is known about both types of cues, and leave out the species
comparison. The comparison between T. kanzawai and T. urticae seems to be a completely
different question, namely: do responses to predator cues vary in response to variation in
evolutionary history of predation pressure? I think this idea is very interesting, but it does not
add significantly to this manuscript, especially since parallel assays for both species were not
done for all experiments. In addition, there is more than enough material for this manuscript with
just the first three experiments. It therefore seems like Experiment 4 might fit better as a separate
publication; if the authors really want to keep it in the current manuscript, then it should be tied
in to the other ideas much more directly throughout the manuscript.
2. I found the discussion difficult to follow in its current form. This may partially stem from the
issue described above. Because I did not entirely understand how all three ideas in the paper fit
together and what outcomes the authors were expecting, it was not immediately clear to me
which findings were most important or how they related back to the question and hypothesis.
The authors may also be able to clarify the main points in the discussion by dedicating each
6
paragraph to an important finding rather than dedicating each paragraph to a different
experiment. For example, with the possible introductory framework I described previously, one
paragraph could describe what happens when only conspecific cues are present, another could
describe what happens when only predator cues are present, and another could describe what
happens when both cues are present. Finally, it was not clear to me how the specific experiments
fit together/why the authors chose to perform these specific experiments to address their
question, so explaining that would also help clarify the important points in the discussion. Again,
some specific comments are below.
Abstract:
It would be good to include the specific hypothesis in the abstract.
Introduction:
Line 57-58: I am not sure that this sentence adequately describes all of the ideas in this paper. A
more focused statement might be helpful, perhaps about competing cues that convey information
about oviposition sites. It may also be good to define “learning,” because some may not consider
what is described here to be learning.
Lines 59-65: Here, I believe that information about behavioral responses to conspecific cues in the
context of oviposition would be more helpful, instead of information about the two species.
Line 74-76: The concept of the dilution effect should appear earlier and be explained in more
detail in the introduction. It was not clear until the discussion why the dilution effect might be
more important than avoiding predators by ovipositing on the web, but this idea is central to the
manuscript.
Line 82-83: Specifically how would cohabitation with conspecifics after predator experience
change behavior?
Line 76-84: Instead of introducing each experiment separately here, it might be more effective to
first give overall predictions following from the hypothesis, then explain how the experiments
test the predictions. That would help the reader understand how the experiments are related and
together address the hypothesis.
Methods:
Line 100: For this study, a brief methods overview explaining what was done (and which ties all
the different experiments together) would be helpful, especially for example when Experiment 4
is referenced (line 116) but the reader has not yet learned what was done in Experiment 4.
Line 132: Experiment 1: How did you keep track of which eggs were laid by the first female and
which were laid by the second, focal female? I had the same question for Experiment 3.
Line 185: It would be helpful to provide justification for why the Steel-Dwass test was used.
Results:
Line 189: It seems like the number of conspecific eggs already on the leaf (total egg number, eggs
on the leaf surface, and eggs on the web) in the eggs+ group varied among experimental subjects.
Did that variation in the number of conspecific eggs affect oviposition in this group?
Line 218-219: They laid more eggs after cohabiting with males compared to what? Both alone and
with females?
7
Some of the figures seem unnecessary. For example, it seems sufficient to just state that there was
no difference between eggs- and eggs+ females in the number of eggs laid per female in the text,
rather than additionally include Figure 3b, especially since number of eggs laid per female was
not the central variable of interest in this experiment. Similarly, Figure 5b may not be necessary.
With so many figures, it is not immediately clear which findings are most important.
Discussion:
Line 255-261: These wording of these sentences is confusing. The authors refer to the threat-
females exposed to conspecifc eggs as existing in “solitude” and in the “absence of conspecifics”,
and the threat+ females as laying more eggs “in the absence of threat”, statements which seem
contradictory. I believe the authors mean that past exposure to a cue (conspecific cue or predator
cue) leads to a change in behavior when the cue is subsequently absent. Careful wording should
be used here to emphasize that nuance and avoid confusion. It may be clearer to lead with a
sentence stating that finding, then backing it up with examples from the different experiments.
Line 261-261: Why does the lack of difference in eggs/female/day on day 1 between threat+ and
threat- females mean that threat-experienced mites perceived no predator on the new leaf?
Line 255-278: There seems to be two separate but related ideas in this paragraph: 1) past exposure
to a cue leads to a change in behavior when the cue is subsequently absent and 2) the change in
behavior is not permanent. Right now these ideas are jumbled together in the paragraph and it
might be helpful to separate them more or put them in two separate paragraphs.
Lines 280-283: Which part of the procedure of Exp 3 and which result of Exp 2 are you referring
to?
Lines 283-296: This argument does not seem fully convincing, since the presence of males alone
does not seem like a reliable indicator of the presence of females that would actually produce the
conspecific eggs. More details about the group composition or encounter rates of these mites
might make this argument more convincing.
Minor comments:
Line 51: remove the “for” in “…preferred for oviposition substrate…”
Line 74: remove “the” in “…predators in the nature”
Line 77: the phrase “conservation of oviposition site…on the leaf surface” is confusing- consider
re-phrasing
Line 103: I am not sure what “expanded primary leaf” means- please explain
Line 219: The figure details can go in the figure caption.
Line 257: The information in parentheses is unnecessary and makes the sentence difficult to
understand.
Line 271: I do not know the biological significance of accessing leaf juice for this species- please
explain
Figure 1: What is a pellet, in the context of this figure?

This study examines the effect of past and current experience on oviposition site choice of two
species of spider mites. Understanding how current and past experience affect behaviours,
particularly those linked to reproductive fitness, is an area of intense interest in the literature.
This empirical paper contributes to an understanding of whether and how invertebrates can
‘titrate’ risk versus benefit in light of information that might predict contextual determinants of
behavior-fitness links. In the main species studied here (Tetranychus kanzawai) the authors
examined how oviposition site choice was affected by past experience with conspecific eggs, or
eggs and (egg) predators, and effects of the presence of male or female conspecifics at the time of
oviposition. They also examine responses of an ecologically distinct conspecific (T. urticae) to past
experience with eggs and (egg) predators. They test the idea that mite oviposition location
should shift in response to experience with predators, since this indicates a higher risk of laying
where eggs are more vulnerable to predation (on leaves) even though the safer substrate (on
webs) has costs in terms of offspring feeding. They also test the idea that this can be moderated
by other factors, including the presence of conspecific eggs on the leaf (which they assume would

As predicted, they show that these invertebrates increase relative oviposition rates on safe (web)

duration of these effects is more sustained in the species in which predation is a more constant
11
risk in nature (T. kanzawai). Moreover, their results for T. kanzawai suggest that oviposition
behaviour may be affected by both past and current indicators of conspecific presence
(past:conspecific egg presence on leaves; present: adult males on leaves). These results join a
body of literature showing that invertebrates, despite relatively simple nervous systems, are able
to integrate past experience in future behavioural choices, with examples now present in
behaviors as diverse as mate choice, foraging and aggressive behaviours.
I found this manuscript a pleasure to read.The writing was clear. The methods were elegant,

Manuscript: “Behavioural flexibility in spider mites: oviposition site shifts based on past and
present stimuli from conspecifics and predators”
ID: RSOS-170328
Summary:
The authors are interested in flexible oviposition in T. kanzawai spider mites in response to
predator cues and the presence of conspecific eggs. They hypothesize that a dilution effect of
laying eggs with other conspecific eggs on the leaf surface could be more effective at preventing
predation than laying eggs on the predator-protected web, possibly explaining why more eggs
are generally laid on the leaf surface. Several experiments are performed to test if 1) the presence
of conspecific eggs leads to higher prevalence of eggs laid on the leaf surface, 2) additional
experience with a predator cue induces a shift to laying more eggs on the web, 3) the presence of
live conspecific males or females after a predator cue induces a shift back to laying more eggs on
the leaf surface, and 4) if two different species with different predation history show different
oviposition behavior. They found that the presence of conspecific eggs leads to increased
oviposition on the leaf surface rather than the web, but that females shift to laying more eggs on
the web with both conspecific egg and predator cues. T. urticae, which has an evolutionary
history with lower predation than T. kanzawai, seems to show a similar pattern, but the shift
does not last as long. Finally, T. kanzawai cohabiting with live males but not females after
exposure to a predator cue seemed to reduce the amount of eggs laid on the web compared to
being alone. Flexible and dynamic oviposition behavior in response to different cues is
highlighted as a major result of the manuscript.
The authors chose a very promising study system that seems to have much to offer in terms of
testing hypotheses about flexible oviposition behavior. They use relevant conspecific and
13
predator cues to address their question of why more eggs are generally laid on the leaf surface
despite an apparent benefit of protection from predators when eggs are laid on the web instead.
The overarching idea of a trade-off between direct protection from predators afforded by laying
eggs on the web and indirect protection via a dilution effect on the leaf surface is an interesting
question. However, there are many different ideas in this manuscript that don’t always seem to
fit together well. In addition, some clarification would be helpful with regard to the
question/hypothesis and why the authors chose to do the specific experiments described here.
The most important findings (and how they relate to the hypothesis) should also be highlighted
more clearly in the discussion. Some suggestions for strengthening the manuscript are detailed
below.
Major comments:
1. There seem to be several different ideas in this manuscript, and it is not always clear how they
fit together. The current main focus of the manuscript seems to be on responses to predator cues,
but the ideas of conspecific cues and predator-related evolutionary history of different species
also come up. In this version of the manuscript, I think that these additional ideas make it
difficult to identify the main point of the paper. If the authors want to leave all three ideas in the
paper, then I have two specific suggestions: 1) the introduction should be re-written to better
introduce all of the ideas and explain how they are related, and 2) the authors should state a focal
question/problem that encompasses all of the ideas. Flexibility in oviposition is a broad topic,
and the manuscript would benefit from a more focused question relating to the cues the authors
focused on.
In particular, more weight should be given to conspecific cues than is currently in the
introduction, since many of the experiments (and the discussion) are about effects of conspecific
cues on oviposition. For example, the introduction could easily be re-written to focus on the
interplay and trade-offs between predator cues and conspecific cues, instead of the current focus
which is mainly on predator cues. If I understand correctly, predator cues should induce
oviposition on the web, while conspecific cues should induce oviposition on the leaf surface- both
for protection from predators. In the wild, females likely encounter both cues, so what do they do
in that case? Which cues are prioritized when both are present? To me, this is the most novel
contribution of the manuscript. It would be an interesting and broadly-applicable way of framing
the introduction, and it would set the stage for the following experiments more clearly. In
addition, the current hypothesis is that “in T. kanzawai mites, dilution effect of their aggregation
on their host plant could have larger utility than reducing the predation risk of eggs laid on the
leaf surface.” It may be appropriate to re-word the hypothesis, because this study does not
directly demonstrate the dilution effect in this particular system. The study only examines how
different cues affect oviposition behavior; it does not measure survival or predation of eggs
with/without predators after oviposition, and thus does not demonstrate the presence or
adaptiveness of a dilution effect.
Some specific suggestions for changes are below, but my overall suggestion would be to change
the framework of the introduction (and abstract) to better introduce the main
question/hypothesis and what is known about both types of cues, and leave out the species
comparison. The comparison between T. kanzawai and T. urticae seems to be a completely
different question, namely: do responses to predator cues vary in response to variation in
evolutionary history of predation pressure? I think this idea is very interesting, but it does not
add significantly to this manuscript, especially since parallel assays for both species were not
done for all experiments. In addition, there is more than enough material for this manuscript with
just the first three experiments. It therefore seems like Experiment 4 might fit better as a separate
publication; if the authors really want to keep it in the current manuscript, then it should be tied
in to the other ideas much more directly throughout the manuscript.

2. I found the discussion difficult to follow in its current form. This may partially stem from the
issue described above. Because I did not entirely understand how all three ideas in the paper fit
together and what outcomes the authors were expecting, it was not immediately clear to me
which findings were most important or how they related back to the question and hypothesis.
The authors may also be able to clarify the main points in the discussion by dedicating each
paragraph to an important finding rather than dedicating each paragraph to a different
experiment. For example, with the possible introductory framework I described previously, one
paragraph could describe what happens when only conspecific cues are present, another could
describe what happens when only predator cues are present, and another could describe what
happens when both cues are present. Finally, it was not clear to me how the specific experiments
fit together/why the authors chose to perform these specific experiments to address their
question, so explaining that would also help clarify the important points in the discussion. Again,
some specific comments are below.
Abstract:
It would be good to include the specific hypothesis in the abstract.
Introduction:
Line 57-58: I am not sure that this sentence adequately describes all of the ideas in this paper. A
more focused statement might be helpful, perhaps about competing cues that convey information
about oviposition sites. It may also be good to define “learning,” because some may not consider
what is described here to be learning.
Lines 59-65: Here, I believe that information about behavioral responses to conspecific cues in the
context of oviposition would be more helpful, instead of information about the two species.
Line 74-76: The concept of the dilution effect should appear earlier and be explained in more
detail in the introduction. It was not clear until the discussion why the dilution effect might be
more important than avoiding predators by ovipositing on the web, but this idea is central to the
manuscript.
Line 82-83: Specifically how would cohabitation with conspecifics after predator experience
change behavior?
Line 76-84: Instead of introducing each experiment separately here, it might be more effective to
first give overall predictions following from the hypothesis, then explain how the experiments
test the predictions. That would help the reader understand how the experiments are related and
together address the hypothesis.
Methods:
Line 100: For this study, a brief methods overview explaining what was done (and which ties all
the different experiments together) would be helpful, especially for example when Experiment 4
is referenced (line 116) but the reader has not yet learned what was done in Experiment 4.
Line 132: Experiment 1: How did you keep track of which eggs were laid by the first female and
which were laid by the second, focal female? I had the same question for Experiment 3.
Line 185: It would be helpful to provide justification for why the Steel-Dwass test was used.
Results:
Line 189: It seems like the number of conspecific eggs already on the leaf (total egg number, eggs
on the leaf surface, and eggs on the web) in the eggs+ group varied among experimental subjects.
Did that variation in the number of conspecific eggs affect oviposition in this group?
15
Line 218-219: They laid more eggs after cohabiting with males compared to what? Both alone and
with females?
Some of the figures seem unnecessary. For example, it seems sufficient to just state that there was
no difference between eggs- and eggs+ females in the number of eggs laid per female in the text,
rather than additionally include Figure 3b, especially since number of eggs laid per female was
not the central variable of interest in this experiment. Similarly, Figure 5b may not be necessary.
With so many figures, it is not immediately clear which findings are most important.
Discussion:
Line 255-261: These wording of these sentences is confusing. The authors refer to the threat-
females exposed to conspecifc eggs as existing in “solitude” and in the “absence of conspecifics”,
and the threat+ females as laying more eggs “in the absence of threat”, statements which seem
contradictory. I believe the authors mean that past exposure to a cue (conspecific cue or predator
cue) leads to a change in behavior when the cue is subsequently absent. Careful wording should
be used here to emphasize that nuance and avoid confusion. It may be clearer to lead with a
sentence stating that finding, then backing it up with examples from the different experiments.
Line 261-261: Why does the lack of difference in eggs/female/day on day 1 between threat+ and
threat- females mean that threat-experienced mites perceived no predator on the new leaf?
Line 255-278: There seems to be two separate but related ideas in this paragraph: 1) past exposure
to a cue leads to a change in behavior when the cue is subsequently absent and 2) the change in
behavior is not permanent. Right now these ideas are jumbled together in the paragraph and it
might be helpful to separate them more or put them in two separate paragraphs.
Lines 280-283: Which part of the procedure of Exp 3 and which result of Exp 2 are you referring
to?
Lines 283-296: This argument does not seem fully convincing, since the presence of males alone
does not seem like a reliable indicator of the presence of females that would actually produce the
conspecific eggs. More details about the group composition or encounter rates of these mites
might make this argument more convincing.
Minor comments:
Line 51: remove the “for” in “…preferred for oviposition substrate…”
Line 74: remove “the” in “…predators in the nature”
Line 77: the phrase “conservation of oviposition site…on the leaf surface” is confusing- consider
re-phrasing
Line 103: I am not sure what “expanded primary leaf” means- please explain
Line 219: The figure details can go in the figure caption.
Line 257: The information in parentheses is unnecessary and makes the sentence difficult to
understand.
Line 271: I do not know the biological significance of accessing leaf juice for this species- please
explain

Appendix A
Dear Dr. Kevin Padian,
First of all, we thank you for extending the deadline for revising this MS.
We also thank the reviewers for their helpful suggestions. Since we did not clearly state the main
question in our previous MS, Reviewer 2 misunderstood the MS as a mixture of independent topics.
According to the excellent suggestion made by Reviewer 1, this point is now improved. Therefore, we did
not follow some suggestions of Reviewer 2 based on the above misunderstanding. We appreciate it if
you could understand these circumstances.
All other recommendations made by the reviewers have been incorporated as follows. Incidentally,
figures 3b and 5b have been removed according to the suggestion made by Reviewer 2.
We believe that the MS has been improved substantially and hope it is now acceptable for publication.
Yours sincerely,
Aoi Murase
(on behalf of co-authors)
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
>1. The introduction does not contain sufficient information to justify the conspecific presence
treatments, and thus there are no specific predictions about the effects of these treatments (other than
they could moderate effects of predator presence). The result is that this looks like a ‘fishing expedition’
until the discussion. (lines 54-57 are insufficient and the example in parentheses is given with no
context).
As suggested, additional sentences (L78-82) now describe a specific prediction concerning conspecific
presence treatments.
>My suggestion is that the introduction should include more explicitly the costs and benefits of female
laying on leaves vs. web and then the factors that could affect that balance (including that laying on
webs has a cost in terms of offspring feeding). This should be stated in general terms regarding how
information about the relative strength of costs/benefits may be available and change behavioural
choices. So predation information predicts more laying on webs, but dilution effects mean that any
indication of conspecifics laying eggs on leaves leads to focal females choosing to lay on leaves more
frequently. Thus, clearly, presence of eggs (current or past) would provide this information.
As suggested, the Introduction has been reorganized, focusing on costs and benefits of laying eggs on
the webs and leaf surfaces (L66-73). We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful suggestion.
>Current presence of males may also give this information if typically, males co-occur with mated
females. The authors may or may not predict this will be different from responses to the presence of
nymphs. I think this approach would more directly integrate the two treatments in the justification for
the study.
Males do not necessary co-occur with mated females [17] but do co-occur with conspecific eggs.
Because of their frequent copulatory attempts to mated females [28], males are considered more
detectable indicator of conspecific eggs than nymphs who do not usually contact with conspecifics. This
is now explained in the text (L78-82). Please also see our responses to the initial suggestion and
suggestion No.2 below.
>2. Although explained more in the discussion, it is not entirely clear to me how the presence of males
on leaves may be expected to affect female decisions independent of indicating presence of conspecifics.
E.g., do females typically remate over this time period, might they stay on leaves (and thus oviposit
there ) to maintain access to males etc.?
Because only mated females are considered dispersing stage of the mite [17], males remain in their
natal colony as a rule, and thus tend to co-occur with conspecific eggs. Moreover, frequent copulatory
attempts (i.e. direct physical contacts) made by males are substantially different stimuli the mated
females receive from deutonymphs who do not usually contact with conspecifics. Therefore, we
considered cohabitation with males could be the most detectable indicator of conspecific eggs. This
argument is now explained in the text (L78-82; 301-303).
>3. Abstract: last sentence (lines 26-28); here you emphasize how these effects are due to ‘multiple
stimuli from conspecifics and predators’; I am not sure that has been demonstrated. For example, this
could be mediated entirely by chemical cues of eggs and males (this is an extreme example)—so would
it not be better here to emphasize how shifts/learning arise from multiple sources of information (e.g.,
past and present interactions).
We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion. The sentence has been removed.
>4. Lines 111-112, suggested change: Individuals of a specialist predatory mite Neoseiulus womersleyi
**were used in our experiments**. These are a common natural enemy of tetranychid mites that can
penetrate their prey species’ webs [22], **but** eat more eggs on…
As suggested, the sentences have been rephrased (L111-113). We thank the reviewer for the helpful
suggestion.
>5. Line 138-139. Suggested change: Then, **an equal number of** T. kanzawai males were
introduced onto the leaf…
As suggested, the sentence has been rephrased (L139-140). We thank the reviewer for the helpful
suggestion.
>6. lines 148-149. How were new eggs quantified in the eggs+ treatment? Were all eggs counted prior
to introduction of focal females?
Exactly. An additional sentence now explain the procedure (L149-150).
>7. line 174. Why are sample sizes almost double in experiment 3 relative to other experiments?
There is no particular reason. During the preparation of this experiment, we cancelled another one and
all replications were integrated into this experiment.
>8. lines 184-185 and results. Since all GLM’s are listed with a distribution, I assume GLM here refers to
Generalized Linear Models (rather than general linear model?). Please specify on first use of the
abbreviation.
As suggested, it is now specified on first use of the abbreviation (L192).
>9. Figures: Are error bars = standard error throughout?
Yes, they are. They are specified in each figure.
>10. line 229. Can you set the context by starting this paragraph with:
In the absence of a predator experience, T. urticae females lay almost all of their eggs on the leaf (fig.
6).
As suggested, the paragraph now starts with the sentence (L234-235).
>11. line 229-230. Here please refer to proportion of eggs specifically to be consistent with the figure
(figure 6a).’…female laid a higher proportion of their eggs on the web…’
As suggested, the sentence has been rephrased (L235-236).
>12. Lines 232-233. Suggested change:
The total number of eggs/female laid over 4 days was not significantly different in the two predator
experience treatments (p=0.0885; GLM; threat+:threat- was 33.29±1.98:37.30±1.79).
As suggested, the sentence has been rephrased (L238-240).
>13 Discussion. Please start this section with a few statements that summarize all of your results in
terms of the original hypotheses and any new insights, then go on to discuss each one in more detail.
For example:
We have demonstrated that both past experience and current interactions affect oviposition site
selection in Tetranychus mites. Our work suggests that oviposition site is affected by information bout
predation threat and the presence of conspecifics….etc.
As suggested, additional sentences have been included (L250-252). We thank the reviewer for the
helpful suggestion.
>14. Lines 255-256. Not clear to me what this means—laid more eggs on leaf surface compared to web,
or more on leaf then threat + females? Please specify comparison. If what is meant is more on leaf
compared to web for threat- females, then this technically requires a test not yet done (e.g, the % laid
on webs among threat- females versus expectation of 50%).
This argument was due to our misunderstandings. To avoid potential confusion, it has been removed.
>15. Lines 276-277. Not clear to me which data show more hurried egg laying by threat+ T kanzawai
females. I see a difference in number of eggs laid only on day 3 (figure 4b).
As pointed out, a difference in the number of eggs laid on day 3 is the only basis for the hurried egg
laying by threat+ T. kanzawai females. Therefore, we described it as a tendency; we did not assert it.
>16. Lines 279-283. Same query as above for lines 255-256. What is the comparator here?
As suggested, the sentence has been clarified (L288-289).
>17. Lines 286-293. Some of this information would have been useful in the introduction and/or
methods to explain why it is important to focus on total number of eggs a well as proportion, and also
the relevance of male presence as a treatment.
As suggested, the reason for examining total number of eggs produced by females is now explained in
the Method section (L150-152; 167-168; 187-188). An additional explanation about the relevance of
male presence as a treatment is now included in the Introduction section (L78-82). We thank the
reviewer for the thoughtful suggestion.
Reviewer: 2
Major comments:
>1. There seem to be several different ideas in this manuscript, and it is not always clear how they fit
together. The current main focus of the manuscript seems to be on responses to predator cues, but the
ideas of conspecific cues and predator-related evolutionary history of different species also come up. In
this version of the manuscript, I think that these additional ideas make it difficult to identify the main
point of the paper. If the authors want to leave all three ideas in the paper, then I have two specific
suggestions: 1) the introduction should be re-written to better introduce all of the ideas and explain how
they are related, and 2) the authors should state a focal question/problem that encompasses all of the
ideas.
As suggested, the Introduction has been revised by emphasizing the main point (focal question) of the
paper. We believe this will better explain how different experiments are related.
> Flexibility in oviposition is a broad topic, and the manuscript would benefit from a more focused
question relating to the cues the authors focused on.
As suggested, a more focused question is now included in the Introduction (L60-62; 71-73).
>In particular, more weight should be given to conspecific cues than is currently in the introduction,
since many of the experiments (and the discussion) are about effects of conspecific cues on oviposition.
As suggested, additional explanations concerning cospecific cues have been included in the text (L78-
82). Please also see our responses to relevant suggestions made by Reviewer 1.
> For example, the introduction could easily be re-written to focus on the interplay and trade-offs
between predator cues and conspecific cues, instead of the current focus which is mainly on predator
cues. If I understand correctly, predator cues should induce oviposition on the web, while conspecific
cues should induce oviposition on the leaf surface- both for protection from predators. In the wild,
females likely encounter both cues, so what do they do in that case? Which cues are prioritized when
both are present? To me, this is the most novel contribution of the manuscript. It would be an
interesting and broadly-applicable way of framing the introduction, and it would set the stage for the
following experiments more clearly.
As suggested, the Introduction has been reorganized focusing on the suggested trade-offs between
predator information and conspecific cues (L66-73). We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful
suggestion. Please also see our responses to relevant suggestions made by Reviewer 1.
In addition, the current hypothesis is that “in T. kanzawai mites, dilution effect of their aggregation on
their host plant could have larger utility than reducing the predation risk of eggs laid on the leaf
surface.” It may be appropriate to re-word the hypothesis, because this study does not directly
demonstrate the dilution effect in this particular system. The study only examines how different cues
affect oviposition behavior; it does not measure survival or predation of eggs with/without predators
after oviposition, and thus does not demonstrate the presence or adaptiveness of a dilution effect.
We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion. The relevant hypothesis in the Introduction has now been
rephrased (L60-62; 71-73).
>Some specific suggestions for changes are below, but my overall suggestion would be to change the
framework of the introduction (and abstract) to better introduce the main question/hypothesis and what
is known about both types of cues, and leave out the species comparison.
As suggested, the Introduction (along with Abstract) has been revised focusing on main question of the
study (L18-21; 60-61; 71-73).
> The comparison between T. kanzawai and T. urticae seems to be a completely different question,
namely: do responses to predator cues vary in response to variation in evolutionary history of predation
pressure? I think this idea is very interesting, but it does not add significantly to this manuscript,
especially since parallel assays for both species were not done for all experiments. In addition, there is
more than enough material for this manuscript with just the first three experiments. It therefore seems
like Experiment 4 might fit better as a separate publication; if the authors really want to keep it in the
current manuscript, then it should be tied in to the other ideas much more directly throughout the
manuscript.
This misunderstanding probably arose due to our insufficient explanation of the study focus. The
comparison between related mites are not independent topic, but is a circumstantial evidence (as well as
other two ‘ideas’) supporting adaptive learning in the mite. According to the suggestion made by
Reviewer 1, the study focus is now clearly explained in both Introduction (L60-62; 71-73) and
Discussion (L250-252).
>2. I found the discussion difficult to follow in its current form. This may partially stem from the issue
described above. Because I did not entirely understand how all three ideas in the paper fit together and
what outcomes the authors were expecting, it was not immediately clear to me which findings were
most important or how they related back to the question and hypothesis.
According to the suggestion made by Reviewer 1, the Discussion now starts with a few statements that
summarize all results in terms of the original hypotheses and new insights (L250-252), which we believe
would help understanding how specific experiments are related.
> The authors may also be able to clarify the main points in the discussion by dedicating each paragraph
to an important finding rather than dedicating each paragraph to a different experiment. For example,
with the possible introductory framework I described previously, one paragraph could describe what
happens when only conspecific cues are present, another could describe what happens when only
predator cues are present, and another could describe what happens when both cues are present.
It is now explained in both Introduction (L60-62; 71-73) and Discussion (L250-252) that the main point
of the study is to examine adaptive learning of the mite, not to examine independent topics. Please also
see our response to the relevant suggestion above. In addition, we find this suggestion difficult to follow
because our experiments are not designed to separate predator and conspecific cues in this way.
> Finally, it was not clear to me how the specific experiments fit together/why the authors chose to
perform these specific experiments to address their question, so explaining that would also help clarify
the important points in the discussion.
As mentioned in our responses to the relevant suggestion above, the statements in the beginning of the
Discussion (L250-252) would help understanding how specific experiments are related.
Abstract:
>It would be good to include the specific hypothesis in the abstract.
As suggested, it is now included in the Abstract (L18-21).
Introduction:
>Line 57-58: I am not sure that this sentence adequately describes all of the ideas in this paper. A more
focused statement might be helpful, perhaps about competing cues that convey information about
oviposition sites. It may also be good to define “learning,” because some may not consider what is

We agree that this sentence did not describe all of the ideas in this paper. To avoid potential confusion,
this statement has been integrated into more focused one at the end of the next paragraph (L60-62).
>Lines 59-65: Here, I believe that information about behavioral responses to conspecific cues in the
context of oviposition would be more helpful, instead of information about the two species.
To avoid potential confusion, this paragraph has been integrated with the previous one (L45-62). As
explained in our responses to relevant suggestion above, our main focus is not to introduce independent
topics in more detail but to examine adaptive learning in the mite.
>Line 74-76: The concept of the dilution effect should appear earlier and be explained in more detail in
the introduction. It was not clear until the discussion why the dilution effect might be more important
than avoiding predators by ovipositing on the web, but this idea is central to the manuscript.
We agree that the concept of the dilution effect is important in this study. However, we consider that the
concept is a means to demonstrate adaptive learning of the mite, which is a main focus of this study.
Hence we are reluctant to explain the concept in more detail earlier in the Introduction.
>Line 82-83: Specifically how would cohabitation with conspecifics after predator experience change
behavior?
An additional sentence (L81-82) now hypothesizes that frequent copulatory attempts (i.e. physical
contacts) made by conspecific males on predation-threat experienced females would change their
behaviours.
>Line 76-84: Instead of introducing each experiment separately here, it might be more effective to first
give overall predictions following from the hypothesis, then explain how the experiments test the
predictions. That would help the reader understand how the experiments are related and together
address the hypothesis.
As suggested, the main hypothesis of the study is now inserted just before the introduction of each
experiment (L71-73).
Methods:
>Line 100: For this study, a brief methods overview explaining what was done (and which ties all the
different experiments together) would be helpful, especially for example when Experiment 4 is
referenced (line 116) but the reader has not yet learned what was done in Experiment 4.
We did not follow this suggestion because this section is to explain experimental materials. Instead, we
omitted to refer Exp. 4 at this point (L116). Similarly, other expressions referring yet explained
experiments have been reworded (L119).
>Line 132: Experiment 1: How did you keep track of which eggs were laid by the first female and which
were laid by the second, focal female? I had the same question for Experiment 3.
As suggested, it is now explained in the text (L149-150).
>Line 185: It would be helpful to provide justification for why the Steel-Dwass test was used.
As suggested, it is now explained in the text (L193).
Results:
>Line 189: It seems like the number of conspecific eggs already on the leaf (total egg number, eggs on
the leaf surface, and eggs on the web) in the eggs+ group varied among experimental subjects. Did that
variation in the number of conspecific eggs affect oviposition in this group?
This confusion is due to our insufficient explanation for calculating egg numbers. It is now explained in
the text that egg numbers laid by eggs+ females were calculated by subtracting the initial egg numbers
from the cumulative egg numbers (L149-150). That is, total egg numbers do not include eggs laid by
previous females. Therefore, the answer to the question is no.
>Line 218-219: They laid more eggs after cohabiting with males compared to what? Both alone and with
females?
As suggested, it is now explained in the text L225-226).
>Some of the figures seem unnecessary. For example, it seems sufficient to just state that there was no
difference between eggs- and eggs+ females in the number of eggs laid per female in the text, rather
than additionally include Figure 3b, especially since number of eggs laid per female was not the central
variable of interest in this experiment. Similarly, Figure 5b may not be necessary. With so many figures,
it is not immediately clear which findings are most important.
As suggested, Figures 3b and 5b have been removed.
Discussion:
>Line 255-261: These wording of these sentences is confusing. The authors refer to the threat- females
exposed to conspecifc eggs as existing in “solitude” and in the “absence of conspecifics”, and the
threat+ females as laying more eggs “in the absence of threat”, statements which seem contradictory. I
believe the authors mean that past exposure to a cue (conspecific cue or predator cue) leads to a
change in behavior when the cue is subsequently absent. Careful wording should be used here to
emphasize that nuance and avoid confusion. It may be clearer to lead with a sentence stating that
finding, then backing it up with examples from the different experiments.
As suggested, the expression ‘in the absence of threat” has been reworded as ‘in the absence of
“current” threat.’(L268) To avoid potential confusion, the term solitude (along with relevant argument)
has been removed. We thank the reviewer for the helpful comment.
>Line 261-261: Why does the lack of difference in eggs/female/day on day 1 between threat+ and
threat- females mean that threat-experienced mites perceived no predator on the new leaf?
As explained in the sentence just before (L268-269), previous work by Oku et al [26] reported that
presence of N. womersleyi should be reflected in diminished T. kanzawai egg numbers.
>Line 255-278: There seems to be two separate but related ideas in this paragraph: 1) past exposure to
a cue leads to a change in behavior when the cue is subsequently absent and 2) the change in behavior
is not permanent. Right now these ideas are jumbled together in the paragraph and it might be helpful
to separate them more or put them in two separate paragraphs.
As suggested, the paragraph has been separated into two. We thank the reviewer for the helpful
suggestion (L265-287).
>Lines 280-283: Which part of the procedure of Exp 3 and which result of Exp 2 are you referring to?
This argument has been clarified according to the suggestion (L288-292).
>Lines 283-296: This argument does not seem fully convincing, since the presence of males alone does
not seem like a reliable indicator of the presence of females that would actually produce the conspecific
eggs. More details about the group composition or encounter rates of these mites might make this
argument more convincing.
Males do not necessary co-occur with mated females [17] but do co-occur with conspecific eggs.
Because of their frequent copulatory attempts to mated females [28], males are considered more
detectable indicator of conspecific eggs than nymphs who do not usually contact with conspecifics. This
is now explained in the text (L301-303).
We agree that it would be of interest to test detailed group composition or encounter rates of these
mites in future studies. Unfortunately, we do not presently have such data.
Minor comments:
>Line 51: remove the “for” in “…preferred for oviposition substrate…”
Agreed.
>Line 74: remove “the” in “…predators in the nature”
Agreed.
>Line 77: the phrase “conservation of oviposition site…on the leaf surface” is confusing- consider re-
phrasing
As suggested, it has been rephrased (L74).
>Line 103: I am not sure what “expanded primary leaf” means- please explain
As suggested, the term is now explained in the text (L103).
>Line 219: The figure details can go in the figure caption.
As suggested, it has been removed.
>Line 257: The information in parentheses is unnecessary and makes the sentence difficult to
understand.
As suggested, it has been removed.
>Line 271: I do not know the biological significance of accessing leaf juice for this species- please
explain
The expression was inadequate. It has been reworded (L280).
>Figure 1: What is a pellet, in the context of this figure?
It is now explained in the figure caption (L97) that they are faeces of spider mites.
>Figures 4 and 6 should be made larger; I am unable to read the axis labels and keys without zooming
in 200%
As suggested, the figures have been revised.
