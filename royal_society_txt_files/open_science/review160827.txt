This paper presents one visual world eye-tracking study of referential processing, using a
modified version of the Referential Communication Game, introduced into this literature by Herb
Clark and colleagues several decades ago. The study aims to distinguish between accounts of
referential processing that claim that specific “referential pacts” are created between pairs of
interlocutors, and hence that referential processing relies critically (and immediately) on common
ground (the Clark position) and accounts that say the speakers are basically egocentric and treat
apparently useful referential expressions as linguistic units that can be used in a variety of
circumstances, regardless of (speaker) precedent.
The complications of the current version of the task are first that there are (apparently) three
speakers, of which two speak to the participant (though one is a “fake” remote speaker – actually
recorded – and the other is a scripted stooge), but not to each other, setting separate precedents,
second that the participant and their main (stooge) interlocutor have different ideas about how
many pictures they are viewing and about how many the other is viewing, and third that the
crucial utterances involve negations.The details are somewhat complex, and I will not describe
them fully here, but the logic is sound. The result is that, in the crucial condition, there are
different predictions (from the two accounts) for the case where one interlocutor is thought by the
participant to have set two precedents and for the case where two precedents are thought to be
have set by the two different speakers. Furthermore, these predictors are that behaviour should
be similar to that in one of two other conditions in the study – different conditions for the two
different accounts.
In looking at the results, the authors considered first which object in a visual world display a
phrase such as “not the jellyfish” referred to. The results of these judgements were consistent
with the full use of common ground. They then considered eye movements across the display as
judgements were being formulated. Up to about 500ms after the main interlocutor said “not the
jellyfish”, the participants looked at both of the other objects on their screen equally, regardless of
whether there were precedents for the names of those objects, and who they were set by –
precedents which would have justified a positive rather than a negative reference (if there is a
precedent for the name of an object, an indirect negative reference to it – “not the jellyfish” – is
dispreferred). After that point, differences emerged depending on who had set a precedent for
one of the other objects, supporting the idea that common ground was being used.
This is a cleverly designed study and it has a slightly fancy analysis of the eye-movement data,
though I imagine the same conclusions would fall out of an old-fashioned “bin” based analysis,
with bins of “arbitrary” sizes. In my view it provides a rather stronger argument in favour of the
“common ground” hypothesis than the authors suggest, for two reasons. First, the reasoning
required by the participant to figure out what referring expression is appropriate is quite
complicated, and it would not have been altogether surprising if participants had given up on
this calculation and produced data fitting the “linguistic expression” analysis. Second, given the
rather complex reasoning, it is not entirely surprising that it takes 1 to 1.5 seconds (admittedly
this is a crude and misleading way of putting things). Furthermore, there could be some debate
about how quickly common ground theorists might predict that they would detect effects of
common ground. And, on a related but different point, there seems to be a bit of a tendency in
recent work on experimental pragmatics to try to put processing predictions into the mouth of
Grice.
Nevertheless, the paper is a useful addition to the literature, and could be published with minor
revisions.

Minor Points
On page 3, the discussion of conflicting results in the literature is not entirely satisfactory. A
clearer statement, if one is possible, about differences between studies that do and do not support
the immediate use of common ground should be given.
The authors don’t really reconcile their findings here (a relatively rapid use of common ground)
with the “egocentric” results found in previous studies by Keysar’s group (of which Barr was a
member).
Bottom of page 13 – it is rather odd to cite Peter Wason as showing the difficulty of negation, as
he introduced the idea of contexts of plausible denial, in which negation is not difficult.

label_comment_2
In this study, the authors examine the time-course with which listeners resolve the reference of
negative expressions across experimental conditions that dissociate the contribution of “common
ground” and prior “linguistic input”. The study is well designed and executed, but as I point out
below, some additional clarification is needed regarding how the pre-recorded speaker was
introduced in the cover story. With respect to the data analyses, although I am not familiar with
the cluster randomization approach used on the eye-tracking data, the analytic method was
cogently explained and appears to be well motivated. The main finding—that common ground is
ultimately used to determine referent selection, but its contribution does not emerge immediately
4
in processing—informs our understanding of the time evolution of perspective taking. I am
convinced by these results, but I do take issue with how some of these findings have been
framed.
Below, I elaborate on my two main reservations:
1. The authors pre-emptively justify their use of a pre-recorded partner in their General
Discussion. Despite this attempt, details regarding how this second partner was inserted into the
experimental procedure remain unclear. Specifically, the authors need to clarify in the Method (a)
what exactly participants believed about the recorded partner and (b) what participants believed
that the other (confederate) partner believed about that (recorded) partner and what transpired
during the recorded partner’s trials.
With respect to (a), the General Discussion suggests that the recorded partner was thought to be a
real partner (co-present in the lab?). But it’s not clear why participants had not met this partner in
person, under the cover story, given their introduction and role assignment interaction with the
confederate partner.
With respect to (b), were all trials thought to be visible to all three parties, with the audio
presumably shared only between the participant and the partner with whom they were
interacting on a given trial? Or were the trials shared with the recorded partner thought to be
occluded from the confederate partner (and vice-versa)? This information is critical to how
participants may have construed the language game in which they were taking part.
If all trials were construed as being intervisible to all parties, this assumption could affect the
accessibility of the source (speaker) of a given referent. For instance, participants may find it
difficult to determine the source of a critical item mentioned by the recorded speaker because the
confederate speaker was also part of that shared experience (the confederate could presumably
see the trial even if they could not hear the recorded partner’s description; i.e., they shared visual
though not linguistic common ground).
But even if that were not the case (i.e., participants instead believed that the confederate partner
was viewing a blank screen during the recorded partner’s trials), it’s important clarify what
participants believed the confederate partner believed about the recorded partner and what
transpired during those trials. In describing their cover story, the authors are clear about what
participants believed about their partners’ displays (i.e., that partners could see 2 of the 3 objects),
but not about their beliefs about each other (or at least about the confederate’s beliefs about the
recorded partner). Attributions about conversational partners, including whether they are real vs.
simulated, influence the degree to which listeners take the partner’s perspective into account
when interpreting instructions (e.g., Duran, Dale, & Kreuz, 2011); by extension, beliefs about the
partner’s attributions about other task participants could also influence processing.
2. The authors interpret the results as suggesting that participants do not consider common
ground until ~1000-1100 msecs into processing (e.g., “considerations raised by common ground
emerge close to a half second later”, “without considering who has coined it”, etc.). This framing
is puzzling given that that’s the time point when effects of common ground emerge, not when
common ground begins to be considered. The authors seem to acknowledge that common
ground is being actively considered from ~500-1000 msecs, as during that time frame listeners in
the two speaker-two referent and one speaker-two referent conditions are trying to determine the
source of the critical item. In that sense, that time frame is best characterized as one of *assessing*
common ground rather than one of not considering common ground.
My point here might seem subtle, but I think it’s important in the context of connecting these
results to debates about how common ground is processed. It’s not that common ground is
considered late per se, or that intention reading is “not the directing force from the start” (p. 12,
lines 59-60). Listeners here do recognize early on that the critical item has been previously
5
mentioned and their eye-movements’ signatures in the two conditions suggest that they are
trying to determine who has mentioned it. From a memory-based approach, this processing is
constrained by the strength of speaker-referent associations in episodic traces for shared
experiences.
As I suggested above, the ease of assessing common ground and determining the source of
information in this paradigm likely depends on the situational affordances and the language
game that interlocutors think that they’re part of. For instance, if the authors had used a second
confederate with whom participants interacted, instead of a pre-recorded partner, participants
could have created stronger associations between referents and speakers, and common ground
effects might have been observed earlier. Similarly, in contexts where the two partners are more
distinguishable (e.g., in terms of gender / voice, which the authors can potentially explore in
their dataset), common ground effects might emerge earlier than what’s been observed here.
Overall, I find that the distinction between when common ground “is considered” and when its
effects emerge is useful when trying to reconcile the two strong positions in the debate about
common ground (of initial egocentricism vs. the immediate influence of common ground).
Line-by-line comments:
• p. 3 line 20, typo in «should not happened»
• Unanticipated line break on p. 3, lines 27-28
• p. 7, final paragraph under Procedure contains typos (e.g., «listeners select» <U+2192> selected;
«Figure 3 show» <U+2192> shows) and awkward constructions (e.g., «it was placed» x 2)
• p. 8. The listener is referred to as «he» in the main text but as «she» in Figure 3. Keep the
grammatical gender of these precedents consistent :)
• p. 12. Be explicit in the figure caption about how confidence intervals are represented in
Figure 5.
• p. 14, another clarification point: At the end of the Discussion, the authors point out that
referents were grounded with each respective partner and that listeners received “feedback via a
sound from both speakers”. Was this spoken feedback or a digital sound, and did they receive
feedback that distinguished correct from incorrect responses? This information is missing from
the Method and is not apparent in the schematic of the trials’ structure.

ndix A
wer 1 (Alan Garnham) was generally satisfied with the manuscript, and thought that it made a
contribution to the literature with only minimal changes. R1's main point was that perhaps the
d inferences about common ground reflect the complexity of the communicative situation and
nderestimate the time course of effects in a more general situation. We now acknowledge this
ility in the General Discussion. It is a general issue in the area that there are various conflicting
s regarding the time course of common ground, and we now cite a couple of attempts to make
of the confusing picture. We also feel this satisfies R1's additional concern regarding a lack of a
regarding the factors that influence whether effects are seen early or late. The debate is ongoing
resolved, and the best that we can do at the current time is to reference other work that attempts
ide a more coherent picture. Finally, we changed the reference from Wason (1964) to Clark &
(1972) which we think might be more appropriate for this context. We thank R1 for his helpful

quested additional detail regarding how the recorded partner was incorporated into the situation.
rified this further in the procedure section of the manuscript (changes are in red). Our response
ur parts: 1) Participants were led to believe that the recorded partner was a previous participant
ad played the role of a speaker in the same experiment, and that this participant's spoken
tions had been recorded and were now being played back to them; 2) participants were led to
e that while listeners heard the instructions from the remote speaker, the live speaker saw a blank
; 3) participants were also led to believe that the live speaker did not hear the instructions given
istener by the remote speaker because he was wearing headphones; 4) because the task was
ned before participants were “assigned” into the role of listener and the confederate to the role of
r (by a staged drawing of lots), participants should have had no reason to think that the
erate would have different beliefs about the recorded speaker than their own.
agreed with our framing of the results; particularly, our claim that the pattern of results show no
ce of effects of common ground before 1000 ms. We think the distinction between “considering”
ssessing” she proposes is interesting, but we question its theoretical viability, given that partner-
city is considered to be a hallmark of common ground (see Brennan & Clark, 1996). R2 seems
t to interpret the early, partner-independent stages in terms of some kind of primordial common
; however, if that is the case, then the distinction between egocentric and common ground based
sing disintegrates. We agree that something interesting is happening between 500 and 1000 ms;
ver, we also consider R2's characterization of the listener's thought process---something like, this
has been referred to before... but by whom?---as a plausible interpretation of what is going on.
er, note that the perspective according to which the referent is marked as 'old' is the listener's
erspective. A tag of 'old referent' that is not linked to a particular speaker is perfectly consistent
gocentric processing. We feel it would be inconsistent with the literature to label this speaker-
ndent phase of processing as involving common ground in some way. Perhaps there is a way to
he considering/assessing distinction work, but such an account would require elaboration,
t which the position is simply unfalsifiable. We feel that our discussion that is already present
constraint-based models of common ground and the time course of reference resolution
ctorily justifies our framing, at least with regard to the current theoretical state of play.

inal paragraph under Procedure contains typos (e.g., «listeners select» <U+2192> selected; «Figure 3
<U+2192> shows) and awkward constructions (e.g., «it was placed» x 2) FIXED
The listener is referred to as «he» in the main text but as «she» in Figure 3. Keep the grammatical
of these precedents consistent :) FIXED
Be explicit in the figure caption about how confidence intervals are represented in Figure 5.

another clarification point: At the end of the Discussion, the authors point out that referents were
ed with each respective partner and that listeners received “feedback via a sound from both
rs”. Was this spoken feedback or a digital sound, and did they receive feedback that
uished correct from incorrect responses? This information is missing from the Method and is not
nt in the schematic of the trials’ structure. Clarification was provided (in red in the marked
n).
