This is a nice work on methane conversion to butene, very novel, but the description is not so
clear.Also the authors should consider the oxygen species from MoO3, The as prepared catalyst,
H2-activated catalysts and also the used catalyst need characterization to study the mechanism.
The command of English is quite poor. and more data are needed before it is accepted for
publication. The following points should be addressed:
1. L55 p1: please check the sentence: "Study Ni-based bimetallic heterogeneous catalysts for
energy and environmental applications such as environmental remediation - due to its adjustable
chemical / physical properties, these ......."<U+3002>

address the concerns of Reviewer 2# as follows:
ments:
is a nice work on methane conversion to butene, very novel, but the description is not so clear. Also the authors
ld consider the oxygen species from MoO3, The as prepared catalyst, H2-activated catalysts and also the used
yst need characterization to study the mechanism. The command of English is quite poor and more data are needed
re it is accepted for publication. The following points should be addressed:
stions 1:
5 p1: please check the sentence: "Study Ni-based bimetallic heterogeneous catalysts for energy and environmental
cations such as environmental remediation - due to its adjustable chemical / physical properties, these ......."<U+3002>
onse:
hank the reviewer for the valuable comments, according to the suggestion, we have modified the paragraph.
“A study Ni-based bimetallic heterogeneous catalyst for energy and the environment such as environmental
diation takes place due to its adjustable chemical / physical properties as the composition of the bimetallic system,
reparation method and their morphological structure”.
stions 2:
P2, Please check the sentences " The basic understanding of bimetallic systems and their catalytic behavior,
ding nickel-based bimetallic catalyst libraries, for chemical and electrochemical processes such as catalytic
ming, dehydrogenation, hydrogenation and electro-catalytic reactions [8]", . Study on the interaction of microwave
ysts in hydrocarbon reforming [9], the role of microwave in heterogeneous catalytic systems [10] . ".
onse:
rding to the suggestion, the paragraph has been modified.
“From the literature, the basic understanding of bimetallic systems and their catalytic behavior, including nickel-
d bimetallic catalyst, is mainly for the chemical and electrochemical processes in catalytic reforming,
drogenation, hydrogenation and electro-catalytic reactions [8]. A study on the interaction of microwave catalysts in
ocarbon reforming [9] and the role of microwave in heterogeneous catalytic system [10] were cited. The H-ZSM-5
high activity for the direct conversion of ethylene to propylene, the ethylene conversion is 58% at 723K and the
tivities of propylene and butene were 42% and 21% respectively [11].The preparation of acetylene by methane
owave plasma coupling [12, 13] was cited in which process methane might by activated by microwave plasma [14]
electric barrier discharge plasma [15]. The effect of frequency on the catalytic oligomerization of methane by
owave heating [16] was studied. Ni-AlSBA-15 mesoporous catalysts have a highly active and stable homogeneous
merization of ethylene [17]. Ni-containing zeolite has a property of ethylene low polymerization demonstrated by
es in chemistry and infrared spectroscopy [18]. Catalytic ethylene dimerization and oligomerization with nickel
plexes containing P, N-chelating ligands [19] and oligomerization of methane by microwave heating [20] were
ed.”
stions 3:
ease check the 2nd para of page 2, the sentences are often not complete. How these can be understood?
onse:
rding to the suggestion, the paragraph has been modified.
Although the dehydrogenation of methane to produce high-carbon hydrocarbons, the literature reported more the
f microwave or plasma discharge technology, but the use of cheap raw materials methane high selectivity and direct
aration of butane had never been reported. We repot here the technology using methane /hydrogen (1:5 v/v) mixed
nickel powder and NiOx-MoOy/SiO2 as catalyst and the microwave for direct liquid fuel synthesis. The "two-step"
ane conversion is greater than 73.2%, butene selectivity is more than 99%, direct synthesis of liquid products
gh GC/EI/MS showed that the content of butene was 89.44%, and the remaining liquid components were the
nol, acetic acid, butenol and butyric acid, the content was 1.0~3.0(wt)%. The high selectivity of methane has
ficant novelty and this technology has potential industrial application prospect.
stions 4:
perimental section, again the command of English needs check.
onse:
According to the suggestion, the experimental section has been carefully examined.
stions 5:
P3, what do you mean ? "Methane synthesis of butene experimental device diagram were shown in Figure 1, the
ce consists of three parts: feed gas flow control device, microwave reactor, reaction product condensed gas-liquid
tion system".
onse:
Methane synthesis of butene experimental device diagram is showed in Figure 1. The device is composed of three
: feed gas flow control device, microwave reactor, reaction product condensed gas-liquid detection system.
owave frequency is 2.45GHz, 700W. Microwave reactor was composed of a cylindrical quartz glass tube having a
h of 200 mm and an inner diameter of 10 mm. The first stage of the reactor was filled with pure nickel powder
yst and connected to the second stage of the reactor filled with NiOx-MoOy /SiO2 composite catalyst.
stions 6:
8 P3, Is the metal content in metallic or oxide form? How is it determined?
onse:
metal content in metallic form, according to the stoichiometric calculation, the contents of nickel, molybdenum and
n were not determined.
amount of nickel added is calculated as following:
Ni (NO3)2•6H2O; Molecular weight: 290.81; Ni 58.69;
(NH4)6Mo7O24•4H2O ; Molecular weight: 1235.86; Mo 95.94;
= 4.460/(58.69/290.81) = 0.900g ;
molar masses of nickel nitrate hexahydrate and nickel were 290.81 g and 58.69 g, respectively;
nickel content is calculated as following:
wt%) = 0.900/(0.900+0.898+8.212) = 9.0%;
amount of molybdate added is calculated as following:
= 1.656/(95.94×7/1235.86) = 0.898g;
molar masses of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate and molybdate were 1235.86g and 95.94 g, respectively;
molybdate content is calculated as following:
wt%) = 0.898/(0.900+0.898+8.212) = 9.0%;
2 = 8.212g;
stions 7:
n you explain why the lower CH4/H2 ratio leads to lower CH4 conversion? This is difficult to understand, any
ucts yield different?
onse:
For your question, we answered as follows:
when CH4: H2 = 1: 5, may be due to sufficient hydrogen partial pressure, resulting in the reaction conversion rate is
but with the hydrogen flow decreases, such as CH4: H2 =1: 4 or 3, due to the reduced partial pressure of hydrogen,
ting in a slight decrease in the conversion of the reaction, indicating that a certain partial pressure of hydrogen is
ssary, because according to formula (1) and formula (2):
reaction rate:
k1 PCH4×PH2 (in the first stage of the reactor) - (1);
k2 P’CH4×PH2×PC2H4 (in the second stage of the reactor) - (2);
- The reaction rate in the first stage and second stage of the reactor, respectively;
2- speed constant,
- the partial pressure of methane in the first stage,
hydrogen partial pressure in the first stage,
4- ethylene partial pressure in the second stage,
4- unreacted methane partial pressure in the second stage;
r2 may be not only related to hydrogen, but also with the PH2 partial pressure or concentration, this means that r1 or r2
oportional to PH2. Besides, the amount of H2 directly determines the amount of regenerated H-Ni-O-H catalyst in situ.
yield depends on the catalytic cycle. See paragraph 3.6.
In fact, hydrogen gas is not only as a reaction raw material, but also as an inhibitor of coke and acetylene, in
ion to the role of carrier gas, it promotes the reactants through the catalyst layer, so the hydrogen should be greatly
ssive.

bles 3-7 are not needed, as it is very routine analysis of the simple hydrocarbon compounds, and well-established.

Tables 3-7 have been removed.
