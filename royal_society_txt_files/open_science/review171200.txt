This is a good paper. The authors present data from Brittle stars moving with various limb
ablations, use that to infer a putative control architecture, and then build and test a robot that is
robust to similar ablations. From the ability of the robot with this control scheme to reproduce the
animal behavior they offer this control scheme as a putative one for further testing in biology,
and as a useful step in robotics, as the robot converges to locomotion after ablation faster than
other methods.
It's a nice demonstration of interesting principles - taking advantage of or depending on physical
interaction, embodiment, to achieve an outcome where explicit neural (or electronic)
communication could have been relied on. Elegant.
In general the methods appear sound. There are a couple points of over-reach or strong
assumption that should be qualified, unless they can be better supported. I am not enough of an
expert on state of the art robotics to determine the veracity of the claim (P14 L50-55) that this is
the first demonstration of physical interaction being key to damage response. I can't think of one
now. While I think this system is neat and particularly suited to this topic, my intuition would be
that there are other studies in robotics that recover from damage in ways that end up relying on
physical interaction, and recover quickly, but don't focus on it.
I do know that work by Aaron Johnson of the Koditschek Lab demonstrated (Johnson, A.M., G.C.
Haynes, and D.E. Koditschek. Disturbance detection, identification, and recovery by gait
transition in legged robots. in 2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and
Systems. 2010) rapid (~seconds) adaptation of gait to the loss of a leg in a six legged robot. It
certainly didn't need many minutes of re-optimization. In this sense the choice of robots for
comparison (Refs 5-15) may somewhat represent straw-men, in that they are studies that attempt
full or lengthy re-optimizations, where this may not be necessary.
But overall it is a novel, interesting study that is well carried out. The formalization of the
embodied control law is well described and interesting.
Comments:
It's not clear in the introduction (p2 L28-L33) that this general statement about conventional
robots refers to those in the previous citations, though this is clear the discussion. It shoudl be
explicit which robots are referred to as being slow to adapt, via citations. Just another in text
citation would help [e.g. 5-15]
The claim that organisms must have simple control schemes because they adapt fast to damage
doesn't really follow. P2, L39-48: I mean, even "simple" nervpus systems are pretty complex,
nonlinear, coupled systems, right? They may end being simple, or they may end up being very
complex. They just do a good job of recovering quickly and doing something useful.
P5L20: I think the following means that this is the focus of the present manuscript?:
However, adaptability to physical damages to the arms has not been discussed yet.
The lack of ground contact experiment with the animals is clever and interesting.
How is limb loss/damaged handled in eqns eg 4.7? does it need to be? What is the adjacent limb
when one is lost? Or is the limb still there, just shorter?
3
P10L55 Why are noise terms critical to detecting the reaction force? So that the robot explores and
"pushes" on the world, to generate a deviation between reference angle, and therefore detect the
force? Elaboration would help here.
Comparing figs 1c and d, the trimming of the limbs are quite significant. I understand this may
be required to make tractable the analysis and robot with necessarily fewer degrees of freedom.
But how different are the kinematics with a full limb? Is propulsion generated in a similar
manner? Do the limbs fall into similar categories of function? E.g. is the control scheme higher
likely a superset or subset of some poentially larger control scheme?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In the paper entitled “A Bio-inspired Robot Capable of Immediately Adapting to Physical
Damage”, the authors introduce a decentralized controller for a five-legged robot. This controller
is inspired by the behaviour of ophiuroid (a five-legged creature) and enables immediate
adaptation for robots after the loss of one or several legs.
First, the paper starts with a behavioural study of the ophiuroids. In particular, the authors study
their gate in their normal state, but also after the amputation of one or several legs. From this
behavioural study, the authors formulated a mathematical model able to generate similar gaits.
Finally, this paper shows the application of this decentralized controller on a physical robot and
how this controller is robust to the loss of one of several legs.
In general, the paper is very clear and seems to contain all the necessary details to reproduce the
experiments. The experimental results demonstrate the high performance of the proposed
controller in five of the seven test scenarios.
My main comment about the paper is about its main claim and the way it is formulated. In the
paper, the authors explain that their approach is considerably faster than conventional robots,
whose adaptation time ranges from several tens of seconds to several minutes. (this sentence is
present several times in the paper) The problem is that this sentence compares families of
4
approaches that have different objectives.
At least, three families of algorithms for damage recovery can be defined:
1) Diagnosis and contingency plans,
2) Robust or fault tolerant controllers,
3) Learning algorithms.
It is difficult to compare approaches from different families and working on different robots,
especially in terms of adaptation speed.
For instance, it should be relatively easy to design a method from the first family to achieve, at
least, the same adaptation speed as the method proposed in this paper: the method introduced in
this paper to detect whether a force assists or impedes movements can be simplified and used as
a quasi-instantaneous diagnostic approach. If no force is perceived, this likely means that the leg
is damaged. Then the robot can switch to a predefined contingency plan designed to cope with
the loss of specific legs.
Similarly, we can argue that the objective of learning algorithm is not to enable immediate
adaptation but to propose a generic approach able to solve the adaptation problem regardless of
the type of robots. Indeed, it is expected that most of learning algorithm are robot-independent
and can be applied on various robots. The cost of this propriety is the time required to learn a
controller on an unknown (un-diagnosed) damaged robot. Conversely, transferring the controller
presented in this paper to a different robot will require to re-do most of the studies and designs.
Finally, it is expected that having fault-tolerant controllers is the fastest and most robust
approach. However, the difficulty of this approach is that designing such controllers on complex
robots (that can be damaged in many different ways) interacting with complex environment
requires extremely important engineering and remains an open-challenge. This paper presents an
interesting approach, based on bio-inspiration, to address this challenge with promising results.
However, I would not be as optimistic as the authors regarding the possibility to scale up the
proposed design principles. While having several distributed decentralized controllers is very
efficient in the scenarios considered in this paper, such approach will become significantly more
challenging as soon as the robot will have to maintain its balance. Indeed, to keep its balance the
robot will need a specific coordination of its legs, which is difficult with decentralized controllers.
For these different reasons, I strongly encourage the authors to revise the formulation of their
claim and to provide more perspective to the readers.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
This paper presents an interesting study of Ophiuroid locomotion, including an experimental
study of the behavioral response to limb loss and the development of a biologically inspired robot
locomotion controller. The expert reviewers both agree that the paper is scientifically sound and
makes a solid contribution to the literature. They raise some points for clarification within the text
and suggest that the authors should consider reformulating some of the discussion around
different approaches and algorithms for damage recovery. It seems that the authors should be
able to address these concerns through minor revisions to the text, but please do provide a
detailed point-by-point response to the referee comments.
Additionally, I have some specific comments for presenting the work more clearly to a broad
audience:
Please consider including a reference to brittle star locomotion in the title, to more accurately
reflect the content of the paper.
The authors should also clarify early in the introduction whether or not both brittle stars and
basket stars are included in the general comments about ophiuroid locomotion.
It is my understanding that the authors have based their study on a single brittle star species.
Perhaps it would be clearer to simply introduce the common name ‘Brittle Star’ in the title and
introduction, and use it throughout the paper except where making a statement about shared
features of all ophiuroids or the specific species of study animals used in the experiments.
Figure 2a might be more effectively and concisely presented in a table.
Finally, please ensure that all data supporting the main findings presented in the paper are made
publicly available in line with the journals Open Data policies.

t is my understanding that the authors have based their study on a single brittle star species. Perhaps
t would be clearer to simply introduce the common name ‘Brittle Star’ in the title and introduction, and
se it throughout the paper except where making a statement about shared features of all ophiuroids or

Comment 1 
n general the methods appear sound. There are a couple points of over-reach or strong assumption that
hould be quali<U+FB01>ed, unless they can be better supported. I am not enough of an expert on state of the art
obotics to determine the veracity of the claim (P14 L50-55) that this is the <U+FB01>rst demonstration of physical
nteraction being key to damage response. I can’t think of one now. While I think this system is neat and
articularly suited to this topic, my intuition would be that there are other studies in robotics that recover
rom damage in ways that end up relying on physical interaction, and recover quickly, but don’t focus on
t.
do know that work by Aaron Johnson of the Koditschek Lab demonstrated (Johnson, A.M., G.C. Haynes,
nd D.E. Koditschek. Disturbance detection, identi<U+FB01>cation, and recovery by gait transition in legged robots.
n 2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems. 2010) rapid (~ seconds)
daptation of gait to the loss of a leg in a six legged robot. It certainly didn’t need many minutes of
e-optimization. In this sense the choice of robots for comparison (Refs 5-15) may somewhat represent
traw-men, in that they are studies that attempt full or lengthy re-optimizations, where this may not be
ecessary.

sponse to comments 1 (also related to Reviewer 2’s comment):
Thank you for the comment. As the referee pointed out, quick damage response was achieved in the work
Koditschek’s group. However, contingency plans when fault is detected are predetermined in their work.
us, their method will fail when unexpected events occur.
Methods based on diagnosis and contingency plans enable quick damage response, but they can work only
en damage is “anticipated”. In contrast, learning and trial-and-error approaches enable adaptation to unex-
ted physical damage, but they require considerable amounts of time. Our method is advantageous in that
an “quickly” adapt to “unexpected” physical damage.
The comparison between the previous and proposed methods was clari<U+FB01>ed in the revised manuscript (see
Change 4> and < Change 5>). The term “unexpected” was added before the term “physical damage” in
title and abstract to emphasize the advantage of this paper (see < Change 1> and < Change 6>). Aaron
nson’s work was added to the reference (see < Change 7>).
Moreover, we admit that the claim in P14 L50-55 was exaggerated. This part was changed to mild expression
he revised manuscript (see < Change 8>).
Comment 2 
t’s not clear in the introduction (p2 L28-L33) that this general statement about conventional robots refers
o those in the previous citations, though this is clear the discussion. It should be explicit which robots
re referred to as being slow to adapt, via citations. Just another in text citation would help [e.g. 5-15]


Thank you for the comment. According to the suggestion, we added a text citation in the revised manuscript

Comment 3 
he claim that organisms must have simple control schemes because they adapt fast to damage doesn’t
eally follow. P2, L39-48: I mean, even ‘simple’ nervous systems are pretty complex, nonlinear, coupled
ystems, right? They may end being simple, or they may end up being very complex. They just do a good
ob of recovering quickly and doing something useful.

sponse to comment 3:
Thank you for the comment. We admit that the term ‘simple’ was inappropriate. What we would like to
in this sentence is that fast damage response can be achieved by small amount of calculation because even
mitive living organisms whose computational resources are quite limited can immediately adapt to physical
mage in real time. We revised the manuscript to clarify this (see < Change 4>).
Comment 4 
5L20: I think the following means that this is the focus of the present manuscript?: However, adaptability
o physical damages to the arms has not been discussed yet.

sponse to comment 4:
Yes, you are right. Because it is obvious that the focus of the present manuscript has not been studied
ore, this sentence is omitted in the revised manuscript (see < Change 9>).
Comment 5 
How is limb loss/damaged handled in eqns eg 4.7? does it need to be? What is the adjacent limb when
ne is lost? Or is the limb still there, just shorter?

sponse to comment 5:
It is assumed in the proposed model that nervous system is not a<U+FB00>ected by physical damages to the arms.
mely, the damaged arms are still there, just shorter. This point is clari<U+FB01>ed in the revised manuscript (see <
ange 10>).

laboration would help here.

sponse to comment 6:
Yes, you are right. The robot cannot interact with the environment without noise. We revised the
nuscript to clarify this point (see < Change 11>).
Comment 7 
omparing <U+FB01>gs 1c and d, the trimming of the limbs are quite signi<U+FB01>cant. I understand this may be required
o make tractable the analysis and robot with necessarily fewer degrees of freedom. But how di<U+FB00>erent are
he kinematics with a full limb? Is propulsion generated in a similar manner? Do the limbs fall into similar
ategories of function? E.g. is the control scheme higher likely a superset or subset of some potentially
arger control scheme?

sponse to comment 7:
Thank you for the comment. Subjects with full limbs move in a qualitatively similar manner as arm-
mmed subjects, although quantitative evaluation is di<U+FB03>cult. Because we think that this point is important
m biological perspective, the manuscript was revised (see < Change 12>). Further, movies of the subjects
h full limbs were added as electronic supplementary material (see < Change 13>).
sponse to Reviewer 2
Comment 1 
My main comment about the paper is about its main claim and the way it is formulated. In the paper,
he authors explain that their approach is considerably faster than conventional robots, whose adaptation
ime ranges from several tens of seconds to several minutes. (this sentence is present several times in the
aper) The problem is that this sentence compares families of approaches that have di<U+FB00>erent objectives.
t least, three families of algorithms for damage recovery can be de<U+FB01>ned:
) Diagnosis and contingency plans,
) Robust or fault tolerant controllers,
) Learning algorithms.
t is di<U+FB03>cult to compare approaches from di<U+FB00>erent families and working on di<U+FB00>erent robots, especially in
erms of adaptation speed. For instance, it should be relatively easy to design a method from the <U+FB01>rst
amily to achieve, at least, the same adaptation speed as the method proposed in this paper: the method
ntroduced in this paper to detect whether a force assists or impedes movements can be simpli<U+FB01>ed and
sed as a quasi-instantaneous diagnostic approach. If no force is perceived, this likely means that the leg
s damaged. Then the robot can switch to a prede<U+FB01>ned contingency plan designed to cope with the loss of
peci<U+FB01>c legs.
imilarly, we can argue that the objective of learning algorithm is not to enable immediate adaptation but
o propose a generic approach able to solve the adaptation problem regardless of the type of robots. Indeed,
t is expected that most of learning algorithm are robot-independent and can be applied on various robots.
he cost of this propriety is the time required to learn a controller on an unknown (un-diagnosed) damaged
obot. Conversely, transferring the controller presented in this paper to a di<U+FB00>erent robot will require to
e-do most of the studies and designs.
inally, it is expected that having fault-tolerant controllers is the fastest and most robust approach. How-
ver, the di<U+FB03>culty of this approach is that designing such controllers on complex robots (that can be
amaged in many di<U+FB00>erent ways) interacting with complex environment requires extremely important
ngineering and remains an open-challenge. This paper presents an interesting approach, based on bio-
nspiration, to address this challenge with promising results. However, I would not be as optimistic as
he authors regarding the possibility to scale up the proposed design principles. While having several dis-
ributed decentralized controllers is very e<U+FB03>cient in the scenarios considered in this paper, such approach
ill become signi<U+FB01>cantly more challenging as soon as the robot will have to maintain its balance. Indeed, to
eep its balance the robot will need a speci<U+FB01>c coordination of its legs, which is di<U+FB03>cult with decentralized
ontrollers.

sponse to comment 1 (also related to comment 1 of Reviewer 1):
Thank you for the comment. We agree that three families of algorithms for damage recovery should not
compared just in terms of adaptation time. Methods based on 1) Diagnosis and contingency plans can
ckly adapt to physical damage. Actually, quick damage response was achieved in the work by Koditschek’s
up (see Response to comment 1 of Reviewer 1). However, these methods will fail when robots encounter
xpected events. In contrast, methods based on 3) Learning algorithms enable adaptation to unexpected
sical damage, but they require considerable amounts of time. We agree that our method is classi<U+FB01>ed into
Robust or fault tolerant controllers, and it is advantageous in that it can “quickly” adapt to “unexpected”
sical damage.
The comparison between the previous and proposed methods was clari<U+FB01>ed in the revised manuscript (<
ange 4> and < Change 5>). The term “unexpected” was added before the term “physical damage” in the
e and abstract to emphasize the advantage of this paper (see < Change 1> and < Change 6>).
As the referee pointed out, our method is not as universal as 3) Learning algorithms and cannot be applied
robots that need to maintain their balance. However, we believe that our method has scope for generic
lication to some extent as described in the second paragraph of the discussion section. The basic idea of our
thod is not restricted to brittle star-like morphology, and it can probably be applied to other type of robots,
, myriapod robots.
The fact that the proposed method is not completely universal but still has a limitation is mentioned in the
ised manuscript (< Change 14>).

rst paragraph in Section 1)
evious version]
Robots are now required to work in harsh environments inaccessible to humans such as disaster areas [1,2],
ant planets [3], and deep oceans [4]. A major obstacle in this regard is that robots cannot cope with physical
mage to their bodies. Hence, engineers have attempted to overcome this problem using several techniques such
self-diagnosis [5-7], learning [8-14], and trial-and-error methods [15]. However, conventional robots require
siderable amounts of time (several tens of seconds to several minutes) to respond to physical damage while
urring high computational costs. In contrast, living organisms survive in harsh environments by coping with
sical damage in real time. The key insight here is that even primitive creatures from amoeba to namatode
ibit such adaptability by coordinating their body parts appropriately [16,17]. This fact indicates that the
chanism to overcome damage via coordination of body parts in living organisms is quite simple, unlike the
trol schemes used in conventional robots. Therefore, clarifying the core mechanism for resilient coordinated
tion in living organisms could pave the way for developing robots that can immediately cope with physical
mage.

A major challenge in robotic design is enabling robots to immediately adapt to physical damage. However,
ventional robots require considerable time (more than several tens of seconds) for adaptation because the
cess entails high computational costs. To overcome this problem, we focus on an ophiuroid<U+2015>a primitive
ature with expendable body parts. Ophiuroids, most of which have <U+FB01>ve <U+FB02>exible arms, occasionally lose
e of them and promptly coordinate the remaining arms to escape from predators. We adopted a synthetic
roach to elucidate the essential mechanism underlying this resilient locomotion. Speci<U+FB01>cally, based on
avioural experiments involving ophiuroids whose arms were amputated in various ways, we inferred the
entralized control mechanism that self-coordinates the arm motions by constructing a simple mathematical
del. We implemented this mechanism in an ophiuroid-like robot and demonstrated that it adapts to physical
mage within a few seconds by automatically coordinating its undamaged arms similar to ophiuroids. Through
above-mentioned process, we found that physical interaction between arms plays an essential role for the
lient inter-arm coordination of ophiuroids. This <U+FB01>nding will help develop resilient robots that can work in
ospitable environments. Further, it provides insights into the essential mechanism of resilient coordinated
tions characteristic of animal locomotion.

Movies shown in 5:28-5:38 of video S1 are examples of the data used for the quantitative analysis shown
Figure 3. In the revised manuscript, the corresponding time of video S1 was described when video S1 was
rred.
Further, with regard to the sentence “We found that the robot moved in a manner similar to a brittle star
mediately after it was powered on” in the seventh paragraph of section 5, we noticed that the moment when
robot was powered on is not shown in video S1. Hence, we added video S4 to show that the robot can
rdinate its arms immediately after it is powered on. Thank you for the comment.
