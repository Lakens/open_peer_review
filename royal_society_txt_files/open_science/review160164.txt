I can easily understand that the authors want to get as much as possible out of a dauting task as
moving gulls around Europe. My main concern is, however, that this paper is not specifically
designed to test the hypotheses, but rather a spin-off study from studies testing other hypotheses.
It also has a very broad start with ring species and speciation, but in th end I am not sure if it
sheds so much light on these processes.
Another general comment is that the sentences are mostly very long, making the paper very
wordy and hard to read.
The first concern is whether translocated lesser black-backed gulls behave "normally". The
authors concluded that they likely do, but I am not convinced. A bird moved hundereds of km to
an unknown location, with different environmental conditions than from where it came, is
probably very stressed and might spend a lot of time figuring out where to find food. This, I
think, will lead to a different behaviour than in a bird which knows it turf, as controls did.
To get around the problem of behavioural bias, moving birds between sites would have been
better; i.e. White Sea and Finland with controls at both locations.
How many transmitters were deployed in the first place? The sample size is very different
between the sites, and could this be a result of higher failure rate (deaths?) in translocated
individuals?
P3, L58-60. Control birds were caught during the breeding season whereas translocated birds
were caugth after the breeding season. Does this mean that birds in the control area might have
been caring for eggs or chicks in the study period? This would bias the comparison between the
controls and translocated birds.
P4, L6: Did the Russian fieldwork also take place in 2009?
P4, L10. The immunized birds were translocated, but five days in captivity might stress the birds
very much. This means that most of the translocated Finnish birds had an additional stressful
treatment.
P6, L24: p=0.06 is very close to signifcant different, given the small sample size.
P8, L24: reference 48 is not about "overall populations size of the species is growing". It is based
on data from the early 1980s.

This is an interesting paper using mehodologies that have rarely been used in combination. The
paper is well structured though no always easy to follow.
It seems plausible from your data that translocated birds use different habitats, but can you show
by data on survival rates that they use these novel habitats successfully and not in the "wrong
way", with elevated mortality?
The restriction of analysis of habitat use to the terrestrial part is understandable from a data
availability point of view but LBB Gulls are mostly marine in several parts of their distribution
area and hence this might represent a bias.
You mention the overproportionate use of lakes of LBB Gulls released on Helgoland, with 77% of
all locations. There are just very few ponds on islands near the coast, thus are you sure these are
really lakes??
Please use Helgoland instead of Heligoland
Your conclusions on habitat use are very much in line with what has been seen in recent years in
the southern North Sea. There, several projects have found that LBB Gulls change from primarily
marine foraging activities to intense use of inland areas, within the last few years.

label_comment_3
I do like the idea presented in the manuscript. The methods are appropriate and the structure of
results is clear. However, the manuscript is rather hard to read and there are some parts need to
be change or delate, in my opinion.
Definitions. It is hard to understand what do the Authors really studied because there is a mix of
concepts: flexibility vs plasticity, local adaptation vs individual specialisation. These should be
specified in a clearer way in the introduction and aims.
The Background section needs to be rewritten. P2, lines 8-30 should be rather shortened:
reproductive isolation, hybridization, assortative mating are all off topic here. First, make general
introduction then introduce the species. I would suggest to put the attention on that the
flexibility may influence invasion success. It is also worth to remember that flexible species are
usually among monochromatic birds, species that live in close association with human (human
comensalism), ground nesting species, and dietary generalists. All these fit perfectly to gulls.
They are perfect to study flexibility/local adaptation/invasions!
P2, lines 31-33; The Authors mentioned ecological specialization and speciation hypothesis only
by name. The ecological specialization is fine, but I do not see the reason to mention speciation
hypothesis. The Authors work only with one taxon Larus fuscus, with restricted data.
P2, lines 37-41; This sentence is far too long and very difficult to follow. Try to understand this:
“More specifically we ask to what extent the observed ecological differences in how individuals
in the different populations associate with the local environmental conditions are owed to local
adaptation processes potentially being genetically fixed in the local populations as opposed to
plastic divergence in the realised niches of an otherwise still shared fundamental ecological
niche.”
8
P3, lines 21-26; This is the most important, and I suggest to build the background on this. Make
clearer your expectation afterwards.
Methods. It should be clearly stated that Kazan is outside the breeding range of Larus fuscus.
Would be nice to read your opinion in the discussion how it may influence birds behaviour.
P4, lines 27-28; When it was necessary to correct the results? How they were corrected?
Statistical methods. I advise to describe more friendly how MaxEnt works.
Results. It would be very useful to add to the supplementary materials which subset of
environmental layers contributed to the MaxEnt models and final models themselves.
In case of gulls, special attention should be put on alternative, human-related food resources
(variable: human footprint?). How it influence the results?
What GPS-fix means? Is it random position (flying/sitting bird) or taken during actual habitat
utilization (sitting bird - biological meaning)?
P6, 31-41; It is unclear to what values given in this section (n times more often than expected)
refer. The mean of something can be 20 times “more than” or “higher than” other mean, but the
key point is whether this difference can be considered (1) significant in the statistical sense and (2)
relevant in the biological sense. If Authors do not support their statements in this section (n times
more often than) by any tests (they should), so I find it convenient to say (at least), that these
results suggest important biological differences, even if habitat use is not statistically different
among groups. These are important details that must be said in a clear way - the reader should
learn what results have been obtained, whether they are ‘significant’ or biologically relevant. At
the moment, all this is missing. Studying figure 3 (linked in this section) does not make me sure
that any of observed habitat ‘uses’ really differed from no preference – all error bars overlap with
horizontal line at 1.0 (no preference). Isn’t it inconsistent? In Abstract Authors say about ‘large
differences’ while if my interpretation of fig. 3 is correct, no difference is actually observed, just
trends (see also below).
P 7, lines 27-28 and P2, line 17; “high individual flexibility” vs “ strong individual specialisation”.
Authors cite 6-8 to support two opposite statements, is it correct? It sounds like inaccuracy.
Interesting would be to explore how flexibility is distributed among populations. Is there any
clear limits imposed by environmental constrains (edges vs the center of species distribution) –
See also Valladares et al. 2014, EcolLett; Kawecki 2008, AnnuRevEcolSyst and Kawecki & Ebert
2004, EcoLett.
Fig. 1. It is unclear whether the whole 30 days following releases were included into the analysis –
it seems so. Exact dates of release and tagging of control groups should be given. 30 days since 1
July is different from 30 days since 15 August, and release dates coupled with these 30 days
define whether birds are already on migration or not. From Fig. 1 it can be assumed that some
Kazan birds almost immediately started to migrate, being 1000 km from release site after 10 days
(two inds). Is therefore migration included in the data analysed? In any case, Authors should give
clear criteria on which they decided that a given bird is not yet migrating. Besides, later migration
from Helgoland may stem from either milder climate or association with local, numerous gulls
(intermedius) which do migrate on later dates than fuscus. Has this been controlled for in any
way? Authors should discuss this potentially important point – birds that have left Kazan and
travelled 1000 kms by definition must have more potential in habitat use as they move, in
contrast to ‘sedentary’ group in Helgoland, where birds settled and move within 100 km over 30
days. I can imagine that this affects results, but it is Authors who should convince the reader it is
negligible (if it is).
9
Fig. 2. It should be stated what boxes, vertical lines inside boxes, error bars and single points
show. Besides, first days aren’t shown for every individual as stated in the label – this graph is a
sort of summary rather, than showing individuals. Background colour of boxes should be as on
Fig. 3.
Fig. 3. Dashed line is black, not red. Again, I miss explanations about what boxes, lines, points
and error bars show. If error bars are 95% CI then (clearly they do not show min-max range), no
group uses any habitat preferentially since all overlap with 1.0 – just trends are (rarely) visible.

manuscript. We highly appreciate this, and think that the constructive comments and suggestions have
improved this manuscript. We have provided answers to all of the comments, found below:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
I can easily understand that the authors want to get as much as possible out of a dauting task as
moving gulls around Europe. My main concern is, however, that this paper is not specifically designed to
test the hypotheses, but rather a spin-off study from studies testing other hypotheses. It also has a very
broad start with ring species and speciation, but in th end I am not sure if it sheds so much light on
these processes.
Answer: The reviewer is right in saying that the original tracking data were not collected to test the
hypotheses proposed here, and are thus not a perfectly suited since the "third translocation" between
Finland and the White Sea is missing. However, we do think that the set-up of the original study is
suitable to test these hypotheses - with reservations -, and we see nothing amiss with using such a rich
dataset as these tracking data in multiple studies as long as the data are fit to answer the question. We
have toned down the discussion in saying that this dataset is limited in its explanatory power.
Another general comment is that the sentences are mostly very long, making the paper very wordy and
hard to read.
Answer: This was also mentioned by the second reviewer. We have now tried to break up long sentences
where possible to make the paper more legible.
The first concern is whether translocated lesser black-backed gulls behave "normally". The authors
concluded that they likely do, but I am not convinced. A bird moved hundereds of km to an unknown
location, with different environmental conditions than from where it came, is probably very stressed and
might spend a lot of time figuring out where to find food. This, I think, will lead to a different behaviour
than in a bird which knows it turf, as controls did.
Answer: Ultimately, we do of course not know whether the gulls behaved normally after translocation,
and do not exclude this possibility. However, survival rates did not differ between the different
treatment groups, as was shown in the original study (Wikelski et al. 2015, Sci.Rep.). We now mention
these results in the paper. Furthermore, translocated individuals dispersed soon after their release, and
remained in that area afterwards until the initiation of migration. We think that this is an indication that
the individuals managed to forage successfully. Reviewer 2, who seems to have experience with LBBG in
the southern North Sea, also indicated that the habitat use observed for the birds released in Helgoland
seems to be in line with independent observations.
To get around the problem of behavioural bias, moving birds between sites would have been better; i.e.
White Sea and Finland with controls at both locations.
Answer: This is a point that we have specifically mentioned in the discussion - and such an additional
translocation would have been ideal for this specific study! But, since we used a dataset not specifically
collected for this study, it was not feasible for us to include data from such an additional experiment
retrospectively.
How many transmitters were deployed in the first place? The sample size is very different between the
sites, and could this be a result of higher failure rate (deaths?) in translocated individuals?
Answer: The number of tagged individuals is listed in Table 1, as we previously did not differentiate
between the total number of individuals that were tagged and those for which data are actually available
(due to e.g. the filtering, or early failure of the tag). We have now added this additional information to
Table 1. As mentioned above, a survival analysis was included in the original study (Wikelski et al. 2015,
Sci.Rep.), which concluded that the survival rates were similar for all treatment groups.
P3, L58-60. Control birds were caught during the breeding season whereas translocated birds were
caugth after the breeding season. Does this mean that birds in the control area might have been caring
for eggs or chicks in the study period? This would bias the comparison between the controls and
Answer: For the birds in Finland, this is true - the birds at the White Sea were caught during the same
time as the individuals transported to Kazan. You are right - this might bias the results for the Finnish
birds. We did an additional analysis to test whether this bias exists by comparing habitat use of the
Finnish control birds for the complete available data (including the breeding period) and habitat use
during the breeding period only. We did so by running MaxEnt models for the respective data, and
calculating the difference between predictions for 10'000 presence and absence locations chosen at
random. We found that the differences in predictions was 1.27 %, which we consider to be an indication
of sufficiently similar habitat use. For the sake of a larger sample size, we have decided to keep the
analyses and results for the complete Finnish control data set, but have incorporated this finding into the
manuscript.
P4, L6: Did the Russian fieldwork also take place in 2009?
Answer: Yes! The information was ambiguous in the method section, but we have now changed it to
clarify this.
P4, L10. The immunized birds were translocated, but five days in captivity might stress the birds very
much. This means that most of the translocated Finnish birds had an additional stressful treatment.
Answer: The birds were kept in captivity until the target number of individual were caught, and
translocated immediately after this. The five days were the maximum the birds were kept, but you are
right that this was likely a stressful event for the birds. We highlight that the data we used for the study
has limitations and toned down the interpretation of the results in the discussion accordingly.
P6, L24: p=0.06 is very close to signifcant different, given the small sample size.
Answer: Your are right, and we do think that there actually is a difference in the time when the birds in
Finland and Helgoland initiated migration, and that a slightly bigger sample size would have resulted in a
significant difference (as shown in Figure 2). We re-formulated the result section to make this clearer.
P8, L24: reference 48 is not about "overall populations size of the species is growing". It is based on
data from the early 1980s.
Answer: We added more recent references indicating a similar trend.

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting paper using mehodologies that have rarely been used in combination. The paper is
well structured though no always easy to follow.
Answer: this was a point that reviewer 1 also mentioned. We have tried to break up the longer
sentences where possible to make it easier to read.
It seems plausible from your data that translocated birds use different habitats, but can you show by
data on survival rates that they use these novel habitats successfully and not in the "wrong way", with
elevated mortality?
Answer: It had already been shown in the original study that the survival of individuals did not differ
between treatment groups, neither prior to or after migration. We now specifically mention this in the
discussion and added the corresponding reference (Wikelski et al. 2015, Sci.Rep.).
The restriction of analysis of habitat use to the terrestrial part is understandable from a data availability
point of view but LBB Gulls are mostly marine in several parts of their distribution area and hence this
might represent a bias.
Answer: You are correct! For this reason we had included the more general analysis of habitat use, but
interpretation is for the terrestrial habitat use only.
You mention the overproportionate use of lakes of LBB Gulls released on Helgoland, with 77% of all
locations. There are just very few ponds on islands near the coast, thus are you sure these are really
lakes??
Answer: We are quite sure that our results are correct, though, since the birds released on Helgoland
not necessarily stayed on the island (as seen in Figures 1 and S1). Also, in the dataset we used for the
classification (GSHHS), even small water bodies are included (>= 0.002 km^2). We added this
observation to the manuscript.
Please use Helgoland instead of Heligoland
Answer: changed as suggested.
Your conclusions on habitat use are very much in line with what has been seen in recent years in the
southern North Sea. There, several projects have found that LBB Gulls change from primarily marine
foraging activities to intense use of inland areas, within the last few years.
Answer: Thank you for the information! I had seen a talk where this was shown as well, but at that time
the data were not published. Following your comment, I did find the paper presenting those data - it was
published only a few days ago! These observations are now incorporated into the discussion and the
paper added to the references.
I do like the idea presented in the manuscript. The methods are appropriate and the structure of
results is clear. However, the manuscript is rather hard to read and there are some parts need to be
change or delate, in my opinion.
Answer: Thank you for taking the time to review our manuscript! We appreciated your comments,
many of which make a good point, and we have tried to address them all in an appropriate way.
Please find our answers to your comments and questions below!
Definitions. It is hard to understand what do the Authors really studied because there is a mix of
concepts: flexibility vs plasticity, local adaptation vs individual specialisation. These should be specified
in a clearer way in the introduction and aims.
Answer:I read the manuscript again and with a special focus concerning this comment, and you were
right that our use of terms was slightly confounding. We have tried to make this clearer, and have
adjusted it to a more thoughtful placing of terms. Also, we have removed redundancies, e.g. by
omitting the term "plasticity" completely.
The Background section needs to be rewritten. P2, lines 8-30 should be rather shortened: reproductive
isolation, hybridization, assortative mating are all off topic here. First, make general introduction then
introduce the species. I would suggest to put the attention on that the flexibility may influence
invasion success. It is also worth to remember that flexible species are usually among monochromatic
birds, species that live in close association with human (human comensalism), ground nesting species,
and dietary generalists. All these fit perfectly to gulls. They are perfect to study flexibility/local
adaptation/invasions!
Answer: Thank you for the suggestion - that makes a lot of sense! We have rewritten the introduction
following your remarks. We now focus the attention on flexibility of habitat use and diet and its
potential consequences for individuals, e.g. when having to cope with changed or novel conditions. We
then introduce the Larus argentatus-fuscus-cachinnans group in an abbreviated manner, and that they
are good contenders for a flexible species, allowing them to colonise new environments. Following
that, we build up the argument that when habitat use between different populations, the flexibility can
be mistaken for local adaptation, and that a translocation exeriment can be used to distinguish
flexibility from local adaptation. We than explain the results expected for our experiment under both
situations.
P2, lines 31-33; The Authors mentioned ecological specialization and speciation hypothesis only by
name. The ecological specialization is fine, but I do not see the reason to mention speciation
hypothesis. The Authors work only with one taxon Larus fuscus, with restricted data.
Answer: We do now define these terms more specifically at their first appearance in the text.
Furthermore, we now focus more on the population level within species, and removed our mention of
speciation.
P2, lines 37-41; This sentence is far too long and very difficult to follow. Try to understand this: “More
specifically we ask to what extent the observed ecological differences in how individuals in the
different populations associate with the local environmental conditions are owed to local adaptation
processes potentially being genetically fixed in the local populations as opposed to plastic divergence
in the realised niches of an otherwise still shared fundamental ecological niche.”
Answer: While we adjusted the background according to your suggestions, this sentence was omitted.
P3, lines 21-26; This is the most important, and I suggest to build the background on this. Make
clearer your expectation afterwards.
Answer: thank you for the suggestion! As mentioned above, we have rewritten the background based
on the argument that the distinction between local adaptation and flexibility is important, as both
traits have very different implications.
Methods. It should be clearly stated that Kazan is outside the breeding range of Larus fuscus. Would
be nice to read your opinion in the discussion how it may influence birds behaviour.
Answer: We added this to the main text as suggested, and also list some ideas of how that might
influence the birds' behaviour. As the region around Kazan is a common stopover site for lesser black-
backed gull and all birds used in this study were adults, they might actually have been to the are
P4, lines 27-28; When it was necessary to correct the results? How they were corrected?
Answer: In hindsight, our explanation was rather short and not very clear. We have now elaborated on
this paragraph and added the relevant information how this procedure was applied. We also added
how results from this procedure can be interpreted.
Statistical methods. I advise to describe more friendly how MaxEnt works.
Answer: We have elaborated on the description of MaxEnt. Specifically, we now use the terminology
from Elith et al. (2011), who described MaxEnt for ecologists, rather than the original machine
learning terminology as introduced by Phillips et al. (2006).
Results. It would be very useful to add to the supplementary materials which subset of environmental
layers contributed to the MaxEnt models and final models themselves.
Answer: That is a good idea! We have added this information to the supplementary materials.
Specifically, we added a table that lists the contribution of variables to the MaxEnt models. This
information is provided for each treatment group.
In case of gulls, special attention should be put on alternative, human-related food resources
(variable: human footprint?). How it influence the results?
Answer: While we haven't used a human footprint product, we included a very similar variable that
should inform the model about human-related resources. Specifically, we used the Anthromes dataset
(http://www.ecotope.org/anthromes). This dataset is similar to landcover data, but provides a
classification into "anthropogenic biomes" (e.g., urban, village, cropland, rangeland, seminatural), and
should thus be highly correlated with the human footprint data.
What GPS-fix means? Is it random position (flying/sitting bird) or taken during actual habitat
utilization (sitting bird - biological meaning)?
Answer: Due to our lack of information on the birds' behaviour - no altitude information and only ~6
locations per day - we decided to use all locations irrespective of which behaviour they might
represent. We added this detail as well as our justification to the methods section.
P6, 31-41; It is unclear to what values given in this section (n times more often than expected) refer.
The mean of something can be 20 times “more than” or “higher than” other mean, but the key point is
whether this difference can be considered (1) significant in the statistical sense and (2) relevant in the
biological sense. If Authors do not support their statements in this section (n times more often than)
by any tests (they should), so I find it convenient to say (at least), that these results suggest
important biological differences, even if habitat use is not statistically different among groups. These
are important details that must be said in a clear way - the reader should learn what results have
been obtained, whether they are ‘significant’ or biologically relevant. At the moment, all this is
missing. Studying figure 3 (linked in this section) does not make me sure that any of observed habitat
‘uses’ really differed from no preference – all error bars overlap with horizontal line at 1.0 (no
preference). Isn’t it inconsistent? In Abstract Authors say about ‘large differences’ while if my
interpretation of fig. 3 is correct, no difference is actually observed, just trends (see also below).
Answer: Thank you for your comment on this, also with regard to figure 3. Rather than just calculating
the mean, we have now used bootstrapping to compute 95% confidence intervals and updated figure
3 accordingly. We think that these show the trends much more clearly, although it remains only a
rough estimate for preferences of very general habitat classes. Most confidence intervals on the mean
do not overlap with 1.0, and we now interpret this as an indication for a non-random utilisation that
differs between groups. Following your advice, we have also updated the main text by stating a more
biological interpretation of the approach and corresponding results.
P 7, lines 27-28 and P2, line 17; “high individual flexibility” vs “ strong individual specialisation”.
Authors cite 6-8 to support two opposite statements, is it correct? It sounds like inaccuracy.
Interesting would be to explore how flexibility is distributed among populations. Is there any clear
limits imposed by environmental constrains (edges vs the center of species distribution) – See also
Valladares et al. 2014, EcolLett; Kawecki 2008, AnnuRevEcolSyst and Kawecki & Ebert 2004, EcoLett.
Answer: That seems to have been mix-up with the references, or with how the sentence was written -
thank you for noticing! We have corrected that. I also had a look at the suggested papers - not all of
ecological flexibility in terms of process. Regarding ecological constraints at range edges, I prefer to be
careful with the interpretation as our data are limited to only part of the life history cycle of this
species. Furthermore, as the range expansion seems to be ongoing, I am not sure how well range
edges could be defined. It is however an interesting thought!
Fig. 1. It is unclear whether the whole 30 days following releases were included into the analysis – it
seems so. Exact dates of release and tagging of control groups should be given. 30 days since 1 July is
different from 30 days since 15 August, and release dates coupled with these 30 days define whether
birds are already on migration or not. From Fig. 1 it can be assumed that some Kazan birds almost
immediately started to migrate, being 1000 km from release site after 10 days (two inds). Is therefore
migration included in the data analysed? In any case, Authors should give clear criteria on which they
decided that a given bird is not yet migrating. Besides, later migration from Helgoland may stem from
either milder climate or association with local, numerous gulls (intermedius) which do migrate on later
dates than fuscus. Has this been controlled for in any way? Authors should discuss this potentially
important point – birds that have left Kazan and travelled 1000 kms by definition must have more
potential in habitat use as they move, in contrast to ‘sedentary’ group in Helgoland, where birds
settled and move within 100 km over 30 days. I can imagine that this affects results, but it is Authors
who should convince the reader it is negligible (if it is).
Answer: You are right that this hasn't been very clear in the manuscript before. The first figure
showing displacement was intended to show how the birds reacted in the first 30 days after the
release. These 30 days were different for the different treatment groups, as they were released at
different times, and this period did overlap with the beginning migration season for some individuals.
However, the actual analyses were performed on a timescale that was different from this: From the
day of release until the birds migrated (on and individual bases), which we determined using filtering
as well as a classification based on latitude and daily displacement. We do now describe this in greater
detail in the manuscript, and also added the information about release dates to Table 1. We did not
account for migration beyond that, as there was a lot of overlap between the groups, and mean
differences were smaller than the temporal resolution of environmental data. We did, however, test
whether the earlier release of birds in Finland would affect the results, but found that this was not the
case (p. 5, ll. 191-197).
Fig. 2. It should be stated what boxes, vertical lines inside boxes, error bars and single points show.
Besides, first days aren’t shown for every individual as stated in the label – this graph is a sort of
summary rather, than showing individuals. Background colour of boxes should be as on Fig. 3.
Answer: We have changed the figure according to your advice. We changed the coloring of the boxes
to match the other figures and also included the raw data for each individual in the figure. We changed
the figure caption to contain the necessary details about what each element in the figure represents.
Fig. 3. Dashed line is black, not red. Again, I miss explanations about what boxes, lines, points and
error bars show. If error bars are 95% CI then (clearly they do not show min-max range), no group
uses any habitat preferentially since all overlap with 1.0 – just trends are (rarely) visible.
Answer: You are right! Based on your impressions, we made a new version of the figure, including
newly computed confidence intervals on the mean. We have also changed the figure caption
accordingly, and do now provide the requested details. We have added these details to all figure
captions that were lacking explanation.
thank you very much for continued efforts in helping us to improve the manuscript! We have highly
appreciated your comments and thoughts throughout the process, and also your close look at the latest
version. We have followed your remarks and changed the manuscript accordingly.
