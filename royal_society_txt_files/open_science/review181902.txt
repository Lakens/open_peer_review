This paper presents experimental results measuring diffusion coefficients for supercritical CO2
under a variety of pressure, temperature, and permeability conditions of Berea sandstone. These
results add important data to other studies of supercritical CO2 diffusion coefficients because the
experiments were carried out under conditions relevant for CO2 sequestration. The authors
compile their results with very useful empirical relationship between the diffusion coefficient and
pressure, temperature, and hydrocarbon viscosity. Such a laboratory-based relationship could
prove very useful for numerical modeling studies of CO2 sequestration, and therefore I
recommend that these results be published.
The paper is written in a very straight-forward manner; "this is what we did, and this is what we
measured." However, there are numerous grammatical and style problems, which could be fixed
in revision. I list a few of them here:
line 42 (abstract): "...then grow...". Change to " then grows significantly with increasing pressure":

line 4: change to "has recently attracted much attention".
line 23: Change "researches" to "studies". (apply this throughout the paper).

Studying in the real reservoir conditions is helpful to carry out the field work. I think that some
major improvement can be made.
(1)In page 13, line 20. The first assumption is that the Berea cores used in these experiments
are isotropic. But to the best of my knowledge, there are still some anisotropic Berea sandstones.
So please give some pictures of the cores and setup.
(2)In page 13, line 30-31. Please explain the reason about which model is adapted in these
experiments.
(3)In page 17, line 40. There are 23 groups of data in the table 1, but there are only 20 data
points in figure 5. It should be pointed out that this is applicable to sandstone with a permeability
of 100 mD.
(4)The conclusion in this manuscript is too simple. The effects of temperature and permeability
on CO2 diffusion coefficient are well-known. I think the authors need to facet something new
with comparison to previous work done.

Reviewer 2
In page 13, line 20. The first assumption is that the Berea cores used in these
experiments are isotropic. But to the best of my knowledge, there are still some
anisotropic Berea sandstones. So please give some pictures of the cores and setup.
Responses to comments: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. We took some photos
of the Berea cores and the experimental setup, as shown in Figure 1. The merchant who
provided Berea cores confirmed that these cores were made isotropic. Those cores
marked with 50 are cores with permeability of 50 mD. The other three marked with 100
are cores with permeability of 100 mD.
Figure 1. Berea cores we used in the experiment.
Figure 2. experiment setup.
In the left of Figure 2, it’s the experiment system we build to measure the supercritical
CO2 diffusion coefficients. From left to right, there are computer which collects the
pressure data in real time, temperature and pressure processor box, Julabo oil bath and
pump. In the right of Figure 2, it’s the customized diffusion cell made of stainless steel
and can sustain pressure up to 30 MPa and temperature up to 150 <U+2103>. On the side of the
cell, there is an inlet which connected to the pressure and temperature transducer. The
second inlet on the top is the one we used to inject and eject the supercritical CO2.
In page 13, line 30-31. Please explain the reason about which model is adapted in
these experiments.
Responses to comments: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. The model we used in
this study is adopted from Li’s work which we referred in the manuscript. The reason
that we used this model is that the cores were sealed on the top and bottom sides in both
his and our study. So the diffusion process became a natural convection mass transfer
induced by the diffusion CO2 into a decane-saturated vertical porous column. Equation
2 is a simplified version after a series of derivation from equation 1 and it is really
convenient for calculation in practical application.
We followed the reviewer’s comments and make corresponding changes.
The paragraph has been changed to “Based on the treatments to the cores mentioned
previously, the diffusion process in this study became a natural convection mass transfer
process induced by the diffusion of CO2 into a liquid-saturated vertical porous column.
The effective CO2 diffusion coefficient under non-swelling conditions can be obtained
from Fick’s first law and the continuity equation, as shown in Eq. (1).”

In page 17, line 40. There are 23 groups of data in the table 1, but there are only
20 data points in figure 5. It should be pointed out that this is applicable to
sandstone with a permeability of 100 mD.
Responses to comments: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. The correlation
proposed is based on the data acquired with Berea cores with permeability of 100 mD.
That’s the reason why there are only 20 data points in figure 5. We followed the
reviewer’s comments and make corresponding changes. The sentence has been
rephrased to “The correlation for Berea cores with a permeability of 100 mD is shown
as Equation 3.”
The conclusion in this manuscript is too simple. The effects of temperature and
permeability on CO2 diffusion coefficient are well-known. I think the authors need
to facet something new with comparison to previous work done
Responses to comments: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. The major novelty of
this study focus on supercritical CO2 diffusion characteristics in oil-saturated porous
media under reservoir conditions. There are few studies of CO2 diffusion process under
high pressure and temperatures with the presence of porous media. Also, we are aiming
at finding out whether the effects of temperature, pressure and permeability would still
be the same when it comes to reservoir condition. We rephrased the conclusion part to
emphasize the novelty of this study and add more comparison with previous work
regarding with the presence of porous media.
The paragraph has been rephrased to “These results demonstrated that under reservoir
conditions the supercritical CO2 diffusion coefficient in oil-saturated porous media
increased with increasing pressure and temperature, respectively. However, the effect
of pressure on the diffusion process decreased at elevated temperature condition. Also,
the supercritical CO2 diffusion coefficient first increases slowly at 10 MPa and then
grows significantly with increasing pressure. The increase in the core permeability
increased the diffusion coefficient and the growth trend was steady throughout the
whole temperature range in the experiments. The supercritical state of the CO2 and the
presence of porous media significantly impeded the diffusion process, compared with
the results from pure gas CO2 diffusion in bulk alkanes in previous study. The pressure-
temperature-viscosity based empirical equation developed in this paper successfully
predicted the supercritical CO2 diffusion coefficients in porous media under reservoir
conditions. Moreover, all the experimental data contributed to the theoretical study of
supercritical CO2 diffusion in porous media at elevated temperatures and pressures.”
