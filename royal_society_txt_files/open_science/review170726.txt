This manuscript describes mathematical modelling of TB transmission in South Africa with the
aim of identifying what conditions might need to be met to interrupt transmission. It builds on
previous work from the same group and some model parameters are based on the group’s own
experimental data.
Major comments
1. At present there is little consideration as to how HIV affects the assumptions and parameters in
the model. The model is based on South Africa where most TB is associated with HIV. We know
that HIV affects the risk of progression to disease, infectiousness and duration of infectiousness.
So I feel this should be discussed more explicitly.
2. It would be good to see some more critical discussion of the limitations of the model, and what
experimental data would be useful to improve the model
Minor comments
1. The citations seem not to be in order throughout the text
2. Although this is a technical modelling paper, it would still be good if pejorative terms could be
avoided (e.g. TB infectors, burden)
3. Methods, p2: The effective contact number of 100 seems very high. As I understand this is
based on estimate for population with latent TB infection (using data showing 79% lower risk of
progression from Andrews et al. CID 2012). This could be more explicit in the text and/or Table
1.
4. Methods, p3: For the definition of super-spreaders it would be good to see clear explanation
that this was an arbitrary definition for this analysis and that no standard definition exists
5. Methods, p3: The use of the term ventilation rate (Q) and breathing rate (p) next to each other is
confusing as both these terms could refer to the same thing. I presume ventilation rate refers to
the flow of air – perhaps it could be renamed as ventilation flow rate or just flow rate?
6. Methods, p3: alveolar should be alveoli (plural of alveolus)
7. Discussion, p7: when summarizing the implications of the findings in terms of maintaining a
carbon dioxide level at <1000 ppm in major transmission hotspots, it would be useful to translate
this to something understandable and relatable to interventions. What does this mean in practice?
Could this be achieved by just improving natural ventilation?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
I really like this paper, but not without reservations, and I have several suggestions for
improvement. This is not a detailed review of the mathematical modeling, which appears well-
reasoned, although missing some context in light of other biological and social determinants of
infection.
In the Andersen and May mode of infectious disease epidemic modeling, without any details of
the infection process, a population of susceptible people are exposed to one or more contagious
source cases and some rate of secondary cases result. If that number of secondary cases exceeds
the number of source cases, R > 1, and epidemic propagation (they say transmission) is
sustained. The goal of public health infectious disease control is to somehow reduce R to < 1 on a
sustained basis to assure disease eradication.
Another kind of (related mathematically) modeling of airborne infectious diseases operates at the
building level, commonly called the Wells-Riley (W-R) model, but derived both from
epidemiological modeling and mass balance equations in the physical sciences (conservation of
matter). To their credit, the authors would like to marry the two approaches, incorporating source
strength and exposure time from W-R model, and replacing human pulmonary ventilation rate
and building ventilation rate with much more meaningful rebreathed air volume (RAV). RAV
reflects both building ventilation and occupancy. Human ventilation rate varies, but is taken as a
constant. Their goal is to determine what RAV will sustain transmission at the population level
under low and high burden (exposure) conditions. The authors conclude that super-spreaders
matter transiently under low transmission conditions, but that frequent low-level exposures and
super-spreaders both matter under high exposure conditions. That seems intuitive and is almost
certainly true.
The authors would like to believe that the key factors for transmission are simply the
concentration of infectious particles in the air and how much of that air is inhaled. The
concentration is related to source strength and dilution, and the probability of inhalation
influenced by RAV which they see as a surrogate for the “social factor”, that is, crowding relative
to ventilation – certainly factors associated with poverty. However, social scientists will more
broadly think of many other social factors not captured by RAV, such as nutritional state, indoor
cooking pollution, outdoor air pollution in poor neighborhoods, alcohol, smoking, and poorly
treated diabetes (access to medical care), all of which impact the risk of infection for more reasons
than RAV. I would suggest finding another word other than “social factors” to capture crowding
relative to ventilation, which is all they mean in this paper that is about very selected risk factors
impacting the epidemic.
However, this cross-over between epidemiological modeling and physical modeling of actual
transmission events gets them into problems with semantics, and also some real conceptual
problems. The problems begin in the abstract. About half way down they clearly state,
“conditions necessary to maintain endemic TB transmission” as noted above, but a few lines later
they say with low RVA, “TB transmission occurs only from super-spreaders”. The missing word
is “sustained” transmission at the population level. As written, it sounds like no one gets infected
– but of course, they do, even if unlikely. Although the rest of the paragraph makes the meaning
clear. Minor editing.
A bigger semantic problem is “infectious particle” concentration as determinant of risk of
infection without considering viability, infectivity, and virulence. It has been postulated for
4
decades that the aerosol generating process involving particle formation and
dehydration/rehydration is hard on microbial viability and probably infectivity. Early artificial
nebulization studies by Radcliff and others established that there was likely a rapid die-off of
cultured Mtb organisms due to aerosolization, and that particle size determined penetration into
the alveolar space. The authors speak of sustained infectivity, but the issue goes deeper yet.
Infection occurs at the alveolar macrophage level. Not every viable, still potentially infectious
particle reaching the alveolus is engulfed by an alveolar macrophage, and not every engulfed
Mtb organism results in local sustained infection – depending on local innate, learned, and
adaptive immune responses in the lung. Even if replication occurs in a naïve macrophage,
triggering a T-cell response – macrophage rupture and infection of blood-derived monocytes, the
entire process may progress or come to a halt depending on a complex interaction of microbial
virulence (never mentioned) and host innate, learned, and adaptive immunity – also never
mentioned. To the author, an “infectious particle” reaching the alveolus is equivalent to an
infection, but this is simply not true.
The authors properly quote a number of familiar source strength numbers from the literature,
1.25 per hr from Riley, 13/hr from Nardell, 60/hr from Riley, and 250/hr from Catanzaro. These
numbers derive from sustained infection in guinea pigs (Riley) or in humans (Nardell and
Catanzaro) or even culture or path proven disease (Riley) resulting from exposure – not particles.
To repeat, none of these numbers quantify “infectious particles”, rather, they quantify infectious
“doses” in a probabilistic, Poisson distribution sense that result either in infection measured as
TST positive or in disease. Wells called them “quanta” but “doses” is more easily understood.
We simple do not know how many total particles, viable particles, alveolar deposited particles, or
even macrophage engulfed particles lead to “sustained” infection or disease. Moreover,
Darmadhikari and colleagues have shown in that many TST positive guinea pigs revert to
negative, so called transient infection, a phenomenon that occurs in humans (Friedman) and as a
result of BCG vaccination. Although these significant conceptual issues exist in the paper, it is
fundamentally a mater of semantics. If particles are called ‘doses” part of the problem is
resolved.
The other difficulty is that the authors focus on source strength (dose generation rate) and RAV
as key variables as determinants of sustained transmission. They are important. But they totally
ignore the critically important factors of host susceptibility and microbial virulence. This is
understandable because neither can be measured for modeling purposes. However, there is
considerable evidence that variable host susceptibility is a key factor in transmission, whether
that is vulnerability of entire populations not previously exposed to TB, such as Aboriginal
people around the world, vulnerability attributable to HIV, documented racial differences in
vulnerability to initial infection reported by Stead and Bates. This is not just increased risk of
disease given infection, as suggested by the authors, but of infection itself. Even BCG reduces the
risk of infection as distinct from disease.
On the organism side, Beijing strain are believed to cause more infection, more disease and more
cavitation than other strains, given comparable exposure. There is nothing wrong with focusing
on source strength and RAV, but the existence of other critical determinants of sustained TB
disease in populations deserves mention.
Reinfection of already TB infected or diseased persons is another important but underappreciated
determinant of sustained transmission in a population, but can be acknowledged under the
general topic of dose. Repeated “hits” required to achieve as sustained infection constituting a
higher dose. Because we cannot measure reinfection, it is difficult to model its impact, but some
transmission models do include a reinfection factor. In general, it is believed that prior infection
conveys about a 50-60% protection against new infection – not much different that BCG.
Reinfection and progression to disease is a function of source strength, RAV, host resistance, and
microbial virulence.
The estimated 10 months of infectiousness is certainly questionable, even if it is derived from
5
epidemiological data. That factor depends on cultural factors like stigma, access to health care,
access to rapid diagnostics, and importantly, the rapidity of onset of effective therapy. For
modeling purposes the exact average number is not critical, but the rapidity of diagnosis is
rapidly changing with the roll-out of Xpert-TB. Although not the focus of this modeling paper,
effective treatment is a critical factor influencing sustained transmission – most clearly
demonstrated in the 1950s study of intensive treatment in Alaska. The authors do mention rapid
diagnosis and effective treatment as ways to reduce R to < 1. They mention comparing RAV and
exposure time in the model (p6). Perhaps, like virulence and host resistance, prompt effective
therapy needs to be presented along with source strength and RAV as an equally important
factor in sustained transmission in a population.
In summary, the authors have made an important contribution in estimating the impact of high
and low source strength and high and low RAV on R in a population, but they need to eliminate
the use of “infectious particle” unless it is defined as the number (whatever that is) that results in
an outcome- sustained infection, disease, etc. To talk about “particles” and “numbers of particles
resulting in infection” is confusing – “dose” captures it better, and can incorporate the reality of
reinfection as a critical transmission factor. The paper should also at least acknowledge the
impact of microbial virulence, host resistance, and prompt effective treatment on sustained
transmission, especially in certain populations.

1. General comments. Overall, the conclusion that reduced average shared air as well as reduced
average infectious period will contribute to ending the epidemic by rendering transmission
unsustainable at the population level is intuitive and almost certainly correct in principle.
11
However, putting estimates on the average rebreathed air fraction or infectious period reductions
needed to prevent sustained transmission depends heavily on the assumptions used, some of
which are questionable. I did not notice this initially, but the pre-treatment period of
infectiousness discussion seems shaky, being based on prevalence and incidence of disease
without any data on actual infectiousness. For this study the authors accept the assumption,
prevalence = incidence x duration of condition (period of infectiousness), but in actual fact, as
indicated on page 4, period of infectiousness is hard to know in real life and, I maintain, is really
not the same as the duration of the condition. On house to house prevalence surveys, like the
2007 Wood study in South Africa of 762 random adults, cases are prevalent if they have been
diagnosed already but not fully treated (unlikely to be infectious on treatment) and also newly
diagnosed, smear pos or negative symptomatic cases - diagnosed as a result of the survey
(untreated and more likely to be infectious). I have no problem accepting an average 10 months
pre-treatment infectiousness as plausible, but since many smear positive cases are not infectious
at all and since we rarely know when in the course of the pre-diagnosis period infectiousness
begins, the real average may be considerably longer or shorter than 10 months.
2. Minor annoyances. As pointed out previously, the authors are discussing factors that might
prevent SUSTAINED transmission at the population level, NOT ALL TRANSMISSION. Many of
those instances have been fixed, but others persist and should be fixed.n For example, P. 6 it says
that where RAV less than 100 L/day, TB transmission is from super-spreaders. The implication
is that non-superspreaders cannot transmit - but of course they can - it is less likely, and they
simply cannot sustain transmission at the population level and that needs to be said. There are
other instances. P5, limitations of the model - "transmission is totally aborted" but what they
mean is reduced average transmission will not sustain they epidemic.
P 5. is it reasonable to use 79% protection from previous infection in a largely HIV pos population
- almost certain that protection is less

1. General comments. Overall, the conclusion that reduced average shared air as well as reduced
average infectious period will contribute to ending the epidemic by rendering transmission
unsustainable at the population level is intuitive and almost certainly correct in principle.
However, putting estimates on the average rebreathed air fraction or infectious period reductions
needed to prevent sustained transmission depends heavily on the assumptions used, some of
which are questionable. I did not notice this initially, but the pre-treatment period of
infectiousness discussion seems shaky, being based on prevalence and incidence of disease
without any data on actual infectiousness. For this study the authors accept the assumption,
prevalence = incidence x duration of condition (period of infectiousness), but in actual fact, as
indicated on page 4, period of infectiousness is hard to know in real life and, I maintain, is really
not the same as the duration of the condition. On house to house prevalence surveys, like the
2007 Wood study in South Africa of 762 random adults, cases are prevalent if they have been
diagnosed already but not fully treated (unlikely to be infectious on treatment) and also newly
diagnosed, smear pos or negative symptomatic cases - diagnosed as a result of the survey
(untreated and more likely to be infectious). I have no problem accepting an average 10 months
pre-treatment infectiousness as plausible, but since many smear positive cases are not infectious
at all and since we rarely know when in the course of the pre-diagnosis period infectiousness
begins, the real average may be considerably longer or shorter than 10 months.
2. Minor annoyances. As pointed out previously, the authors are discussing factors that might
prevent SUSTAINED transmission at the population level, NOT ALL TRANSMISSION. Many of
those instances have been fixed, but others persist and should be fixed.n For example, P. 6 it says
that where RAV less than 100 L/day, TB transmission is from super-spreaders. The implication
is that non-superspreaders cannot transmit - but of course they can - it is less likely, and they
simply cannot sustain transmission at the population level and that needs to be said. There are
other instances. P5, limitations of the model - "transmission is totally aborted" but what they
mean is reduced average transmission will not sustain they epidemic.
P 5. is it reasonable to use 79% protection from previous infection in a largely HIV pos population
- almost certain that protection is less

vironmental and Social Factors Impacting on Epidemic and Endemic Tuberculosis: A
delling Analysis
ponse to the reviewers
would like to thank the reviewers for their helpful comments. We have addressed the reviewers
ments as described beneath sequentially.
st reviewer response:
jor comments:
At present there is little consideration as to how HIV affects the assumptions and parameters in
model. The model is based on South Africa where most TB is associated with HIV. We know
HIV affects the risk of progression to disease, infectiousness and duration of infectiousness. So
el this should be discussed more explicitly.
ponse: We agree with the reviewer that HIV increases disease progression and decreases the
ctive contact number on population tuberculosis. Therefore, we have modelled the impact on an
V-infected population using an effective contact number of 10 (Figures 5 and 7). In order to give
ater clarity we have added the following:
V increases the progression from infection to disease especially when the CD4 counts are low
is partially reversed with antiretroviral therapy. [Ref 33]. The impact of HIV on population
erculosis will decrease the effective contact number within the HIV infected. The impact on an
-infected population is modeled in Figure 7 of appendix using an effective contact number of
For all levels of infectiousness and rebreathed air volume control of endemic TB requires the
iod of infectiousness to be reduced, highlighting the need for active case finding in the HIV-
cted population. However, the impact on transmission within the total population will be limited
he prevalence of HIV, which currently in South Africa is 18% of the adult population and access
ntiretroviral therapy [Ref 34]
t would be good to see some more critical discussion of the limitations of the model, and what
erimental data would be useful to improve the model.
ponse: In order to give greater clarity we have added the following:
r transmission model is a development of the Wells and Riley equation that defined the physical
ors that contribute to TB transmission risk of susceptible individuals exposed for a fixed time
iod to an infectious source within a steady-state environment. Our parameter of daily-
reathed indoor air volume, which has been directly measured in a South african population,
wed capture of potential environmental transmission risk for individuals traversing multiple
oor locations without the necessity to define the ventilation within each location. Our model is
ed on a finding “that social characteristics operate only as they contribute to the environmental
or in transmission of tuberculosis infection” [Ref 32]. We populated the model with a wide
ge of infectivity and period of infectiousness, as there are limited data describing these
ameters at a population level. We focused on a population with a high level of endemic TB
nsmission, however populations are not homogeneous and transmission risks vary between
groups within each population. Furthermore as each of the parameters in the model are
tinuous variables which interact with each other, we were not able to define programmatic or
ironmental thresholds above which transmission is totally aborted. We used our model to
onstrate interaction for values of those variables in combination that no longer exceed the
ctive contact number required to maintain endemic transmission. Our model incorporated
nge in risk of progression for latently infected individuals however the role of multiplicity of
ctions and age at infection was not addressed.
nor comments:
he citations seem not to be in order throughout the text
ponse: We have put the citations in a uniform order throughout the text.
Although this is a technical modelling paper, it would still be good if pejorative terms could be
ided (e.g. TB infectors, burden)
ponse: We have replaced the word "TB infectors" with “BT infectious individuals” and
oved the word “burden”.
Methods, p2: The effective contact number of 100 seems very high. As I understand this is based
estimate for population with latent TB infection (using data showing 79% lower risk of
gression from Andrews et al. CID 2012). This could be more explicit in the text and/or Table 1
ponse: The reviewer is correct that the effective contact number of 100 is based on estimate of a
a analysis populations with latent TB infection. In order to give greater clarity we have added
following:
ECN of 20 sustain TB for susceptible patients and that of 100 for the population with latent TB
ction. It shows that the risk of developing active disease for the latently infected is 79% lower
n uninfected individuals [see Ref 19]. This is would represent an approximately ECN of 100 for
viously infected individuals.
Methods, p3: For the definition of super-spreaders it would be good to see clear explanation that
was an arbitrary definition for this analysis and that no standard definition exists
ponse: In order to give greater clarity we have added the following:
duction rates of infectious doses vary widely. In a TB ward, infectious dose production
estimated at 1.25 doses/hr [Ref 20]. In a workplace outbreak from an untreated smear-positive
monary source, infectious dose production was estimated to be 12.7 doses/hr [Ref 28] and a
duction rate of 60 doses/hr has been reported from a highly infectious laryngeal TB case
therefore defined super-spreaders as efficient transmitters or infectious individuals exhaling
ater than or equal to 10 infectious doses/hr and lower infectivity for those exhaling less than 10
ctious doses/hr.
Methods, p3: The use of the term ventilation rate (Q) and breathing rate (p) next to each other is
fusing as both these terms could refer to the same thing. I presume ventilation rate refers to the
w of air – perhaps it could be renamed as ventilation flow rate or just flow rate?
ponse: We have used "ventilation flow rate" instead of "ventilation rate" throughout the text.
Methods, p3: alveolar should be alveoli (plural of alveolus)
ponse: We have replaced the word “alveolar” with “alveoli”
Discussion, p7: when summarizing the implications of the findings in terms of maintaining a
bon dioxide level at <1000 ppm in major transmission hotspots, it would be useful to translate
to something understandable and relatable to interventions. What does this mean in practice?
uld this be achieved by just improving natural ventilation?
ponse: Carbon dioxide is a very diffusible natural tracer gas, which can be easily measured
hin an enclosed environment, and it is used as a measure of indoor air quality. In order to give
ater clarity we have added the following:
ently published studies using carbon dioxide as a naturally occurring tracer gas have measured
volume of exchanged air among residents of South African townships where TB is endemic to be
he range of 100 to 300 L/d and has been estimated to reach greater that 1000 L/d in a crowded
on population. When air volumes exchanged between individuals are high, most TB cases, even
se with low infectivity are able to transmit disease to sufficient numbers of susceptible and
ntly infected individuals, thus maintaining endemic TB.
oor carbon dioxide values are directly related to per person ventilation and 1000 ppm (600ppm
ve environmental) represents a mean per-person ventilation of 666 liters per minute [Ref 3].
ond reviewer response:
eally like this paper, but not without reservations, and I have several suggestions for
rovement. This is not a detailed review of the mathematical modelling, which appears well-
soned, although missing some context in light of other biological and social determinants of
ction.
ponse: We thank the reviewer for appreciating our study.
he Andersen and May mode of infectious disease epidemic modeling, without any details of the
ction process, a population of susceptible people are exposed to one or more contagious source
es and some rate of secondary cases result. If that number of secondary cases exceeds the
mber of source cases, R > 1, and epidemic propagation (they say transmission) is sustained. The
l of public health infectious disease control is to somehow reduce R to < 1 on a sustained basis
ssure disease eradication.
ponse: We agree that TB transmission becomes sustainable at the basic reproduction number
> 1 and may be controlled if R < 1 [Ref 36].
other kind of (related mathematically) modeling of airborne infectious diseases operates at the
lding level, commonly called the Wells-Riley (W-R) model, but derived both from
demiological modeling and mass balance equations in the physical sciences (conservation of
ter). To their credit, the authors would like to marry the two approaches, incorporating source
ngth and exposure time from W-R model, and replacing human pulmonary ventilation rate and
lding ventilation rate with much more meaningful rebreathed air volume (RAV). RAV reflects
h building ventilation and occupancy. Human ventilation rate varies, but is taken as a constant.
ir goal is to determine what RAV will sustain transmission at the population level under low and
h burden (exposure) conditions. The authors conclude that super-spreaders matter transiently
er low transmission conditions, but that frequent low-level exposures and super-spreaders both
ter under high exposure conditions. That seems intuitive and is almost certainly true.
ponse: We thank the reviewer for understanding and acknowledging the study.
authors would like to believe that the key factors for transmission are simply the concentration
nfectious particles in the air and how much of that air is inhaled. The concentration is related to
rce strength and dilution, and the probability of inhalation influenced by RAV which they see as
urrogate for the “social factor”, that is, crowding relative to ventilation – certainly factors
ociated with poverty. However, social scientists will more broadly think of many other social
ors not captured by RAV, such as nutritional state, indoor cooking pollution, outdoor air
lution in poor neighborhoods, alcohol, smoking, and poorly treated diabetes (access to medical
e), all of which impact the risk of infection for more reasons than RAV. I would suggest finding
ther word other than “social factors” to capture crowding relative to ventilation, which is all they
an in this paper that is about very selected risk factors impacting the epidemic.
ponse: In order to give greater clarity we have added the following:
r model is based on a finding that “social characteristics operate only as they contribute to the
ironmental factor in transmission of tuberculosis infection” [Ref 32]. We populated the model
h a wide range of infectivity and period of infectiousness, as there are limited data describing
se parameters at a population level. We focused on a population with a high level of endemic TB
nsmission, however populations are not homogeneous and transmission risks vary between
groups within each population. Furthermore as each of the parameters in the model are
tinuous variables which interact with each other, we were not able to define programmatic or
ironmental thresholds above which transmission is totally aborted. We used our model to
onstrate interaction for values of those variables in combination that no longer exceed the
ctive contact number required to maintain endemic transmission. Our model incorporated
nge in risk of progression for latently infected individuals however the role of multiplicity of
ctions and age at infection was not addressed.
wever, this cross-over between epidemiological modeling and physical modeling of actual
smission events gets them into problems with semantics, and also some real conceptual
blems. The problems begin in the abstract. About half way down they clearly state, “conditions
essary to maintain endemic TB transmission” as noted above, but a few lines later they say with
RVA, “TB transmission occurs only from super-spreaders”. The missing word is “sustained”
smission at the population level. As written, it sounds like no one gets infected – but of course,
y do, even if unlikely. Although the rest of the paragraph makes the meaning clear. Minor
ing.
ponse: We have used the word “sustain” as suggested by the reviewer.
igger semantic problem is “infectious particle” concentration as determinant of risk of infection
hout considering viability, infectivity, and virulence. It has been postulated for decades that the
osol generating process involving particle formation and dehydration/rehydration is hard on
robial viability and probably infectivity. Early artificial nebulization studies by Radcliff and
ers established that there was likely a rapid die-off of cultured Mtb organisms due to
osolization, and that particle size determined penetration into the alveolar space. The authors
ak of sustained infectivity, but the issue goes deeper yet. Infection occurs at the alveolar
crophage level. Not every viable, still potentially infectious particle reaching the alveolus is
ulfed by an alveolar macrophage, and not every engulfed Mtb organism results in local
tained infection – depending on local innate, learned, and adaptive immune responses in the
g. Even if replication occurs in a naïve macrophage, triggering a T-cell response – macrophage
ture and infection of blood-derived monocytes, the entire process may progress or come to a halt
ending on a complex interaction of microbial virulence (never mentioned) and host innate,
ned, and adaptive immunity – also never mentioned. To the author, an “infectious particle”
ching the alveolus is equivalent to an infection, but this is simply not true.
ponse: The reviewer is correct that infection and disease progression usually depend on the
lence of the infecting pathogen strain and host immune response. In order to give greater clarity
have added the following:
he design of the model, we take into account that when susceptible individuals become exposed
airborne infectious doses viable with the potential for TB infection reach the alveoli, they may
infected or not, depending on the virulence of the infecting pathogen strain and the
unological status of the hosts. (ß - µ) is the surviving airborne infectious doses per unit time
ses/hr) that reach the alveoli to establish infection depending on the virulence of the infecting
hogen strain and host immune systems.
authors properly quote a number of familiar source strength numbers from the literature, 1.25
hr from Riley, 13/hr from Nardell, 60/hr from Riley, and 250/hr from Catanzaro. These numbers
ive from sustained infection in guinea pigs (Riley) or in humans (Nardell and Catanzaro) or even
ure or path proven disease (Riley) resulting from exposure – not particles. To repeat, none of
se numbers quantify “infectious particles”, rather, they quantify infectious “doses” in a
babilistic, Poisson distribution sense that result either in infection measured as TST positive or in
ease. Wells called them “quanta” but “doses” is more easily understood. We simple do not know
many total particles, viable particles, alveolar deposited particles, or even macrophage
ulfed particles lead to “sustained” infection or disease. Moreover, Darmadhikari and colleagues
e shown in that many TST positive guinea pigs revert to negative, so called transient infection, a
nomenon that occurs in humans (Friedman) and as a result of BCG vaccination. Although these
nificant conceptual issues exist in the paper, it is fundamentally a mater of semantics. If particles
called ‘doses” part of the problem is resolved.
ponse: Since Wells (1955) first used the word quanta, it has caused some confusion to
demiologists and the community in general, in understanding TB transmission. This is because
ctious quantum hides many significant parameters such as particle size, deposition fraction,
terial mortality and survival which have been previously difficult to measure, they may be
enable to modern technological measurement (Ref 3). In contrast to Wells–Riley and the prior
dified Well–Riley models, we used "airborne infectious particles" in our previous published
dy to develop a flexible mathematical model that predicts the risk of airborne infectious diseases,
h as TB, at steady state and non-steady state conditions (Ref 3). The word “dose” refers to an
mated number of infectious particles that reach the alveoli without loss consideration. However,
ce both infectious doses and particles reflect infectious agents viable with the potential for TB
ction, we have used “infectious dose” instead of “infectious particles”.
s true that we cannot directly measure and determine the exact number of infectious doses
sent in any infectious disease outbreak. Airborne infectious particles expelled by infectious
ividuals are randomly distributed in air and any estimated exposure level or intake would be an
ected value rather than an exact one. We have therefore added the following:
en susceptible individuals become exposed to the airborne infectious doses, they may be infected
not, depending on the virulence of the infecting pathogen strain and the immune response of the
ts.
other difficulty is that the authors focus on source strength (dose generation rate) and RAV as
variables as determinants of sustained transmission. They are important. But they totally
ore the critically important factors of host susceptibility and microbial virulence. This is
erstandable because neither can be measured for modeling purposes. However, there is
siderable evidence that variable host susceptibility is a key factor in transmission, whether that
vulnerability of entire populations not previously exposed to TB, such as Aboriginal people
und the world, vulnerability attributable to HIV, documented racial differences in vulnerability
nitial infection reported by Stead and Bates. This is not just increased risk of disease given
ction, as suggested by the authors, but of infection itself. Even BCG reduces the risk of
ction as distinct from disease.
ponse: We agree with the reviewer that when susceptible individuals become exposed and
orne infectious particles reach the alveoli, they may be infected or not, depending on the
lence of the infecting pathogen strain and the immune response of the hosts.
mentioned earlier, the following sentence has been included in the manuscript for clarity:
he design of the model, we take into account that when susceptible individuals become exposed
airborne infectious particles viable with the potential for TB infection reach the alveoli, they
y be infected or not, depending on the virulence of the infecting pathogen strain and the
unological status of the hosts.
the organism side, Beijing strain are believed to cause more infection, more disease and more
itation than other strains, given comparable exposure. There is nothing wrong with focusing on
rce strength and RAV, but the existence of other critical determinants of sustained TB disease in
ulations deserves mention.
ponse: It is true that when susceptible individuals become exposed and airborne infectious
es viable with the potential for TB infection reach the alveoli, they may be infected or not,
ending on the virulence of the infecting pathogen strain and the immunological status of the
ts. Furthermore, since HIV decreases the effective contact number and increases disease
gression on population tuberculosis, we have modelled the impact on the HIV-infected
ulation using an effective contact number of 10 (Figures 5 and 7). In order to give gretaer clarity
have added the following:
V increases the progression from infection to disease especially when the CD4 counts are
and is partially reversed with antiretroviral therapy [Ref 33]. The impact of HIV on population
erculosis will decrease the effective contact number within the HIV infected. The impact
an HIV-infected population is modelled in Figures 5 and 7 (Appendix) using an effective
tact number of 10. For all levels of infectiousness and rebreathed air volume control of endemic
requires the period of infectiousness to be reduced, highlighting the need for active case finding
he HIV-infected population. However, the impact on transmission within the total population
be limited by the prevalence of HIV, which currently in South Africa is 18% of the adult
ulation.
nfection of already TB infected or diseased persons is another important but underappreciated
erminant of sustained transmission in a population, but can be acknowledged under the general
ic of dose. Repeated “hits” required to achieve as sustained infection constituting a higher dose.
ause we cannot measure reinfection, it is difficult to model its impact, but some transmission
dels do include a reinfection factor. In general, it is believed that prior infection conveys about a
60% protection against new infection – not much different that BCG. Reinfection and
gression to disease is a function of source strength, RAV, host resistance, and microbial
lence.
ponse: The reviewer is correct that reinfection of already TB infected or diseased persons is
ther important factor of TB transmission. Additionally, it is estimated that the risk of developing
ve disease for the latently infected or reinfected is 79% lower than uninfected individuals (Ref
, implying that the immune protection induced by natural MTB infection is approximately equal
hat of the vaccine in low TB burden settings, such as the United Kingdom. However, socio-
ironemtal conditions influencing reinfection are exactly the same or equivalent to those captured
he primary infection as described in the study. In order to give greater clarity we have added the
owing:
ECN of 20 is based on the estimate of TB transmission among susceptible [ref 18] and that of
for the population with latent TB infection [ref 19]. It is estimated that the risk of developing
ve disease for the latently infected is 79% lower than uninfected individuals, suggesting that
or natural MTB infection reduces TB susceptibility.
estimated 10 months of infectiousness is certainly questionable, even if it is derived from
demiological data. That factor depends on cultural factors like stigma, access to health care,
ess to rapid diagnostics, and importantly, the rapidity of onset of effective therapy. For modeling
poses the exact average number is not critical, but the rapidity of diagnosis is rapidly changing
h the roll-out of Xpert-TB. Although not the focus of this modeling paper, effective treatment is
ritical factor influencing sustained transmission – most clearly demonstrated in the 1950s study
ntensive treatment in Alaska. The authors do mention rapid diagnosis and effective treatment as
ys to reduce R to < 1. They mention comparing RAV and exposure time in the model (p6).
haps, like virulence and host resistance, prompt effective therapy needs to be presented along
h source strength and RAV as an equally important factor in sustained transmission in a
ulation.
ponse: We would like to remind the reviewer that this study is based in South Africa.
refore, we computed the period of infectiousness based on WHO data in South Africa. As
ntioned in Table 1 in the manuscript, TB prevalence and incidence in South Africa is 696 and
per 100,000 population per year, respectively (see Ref 12 and 13). The period of infectiousness
he ratio of TB prevalence and incidence, which is equivalent to 10 months. In order to give
ity we added the following:
Word Health Organisation (WHO) global TB report 2015 estimated South African prevalence
incidence rates at 696/100, 000 and 834/100, 000 respectively, which is consistent with a mean
iod of infectiousness of 10 months [ref 12]. Additionally, it is estimated that the period of
ctiousness of TB patients before treatment is 0.73 - 1.02 years (8.76 - 12.24 months) for HIV
ative smear negative and smear positive in South African population [Ref 35].
ummary, the authors have made an important contribution in estimating the impact of high and
source strength and high and low RAV on R in a population, but they need to eliminate the use
“infectious particle” unless it is defined as the number (whatever that is) that results in an
come- sustained infection, disease, etc. To talk about “particles” and “numbers of particles
ulting in infection” is confusing – “dose” captures it better, and can incorporate the reality of
fection as a critical transmission factor. The paper should also at least acknowledge the impact
microbial virulence, host resistance, and prompt effective treatment on sustained transmission,
ecially in certain populations.
ponse: We would like to thank the reviewers again for appreciating and acknowledging the
dy. We have used “infectious doses” instead of “infectious particles” and we have acknowledged
impact of “microbial virulence” and “host immune response”. Additionally, we have addressed
the comments by giving greater clarity underneath each comment as discussed above.

General comments. Overall, the conclusion that reduced average shared air as well as reduced
rage infectious period will contribute to ending the epidemic by rendering transmission
ustainable at the population level is intuitive and almost certainly correct in principle. However,
ting estimates on the average rebreathed air fraction or infectious period reductions needed to
vent sustained transmission depends heavily on the assumptions used, some of which are
stionable. I did not notice this initially, but the pre-treatment period of infectiousness discussion
ms shaky, being based on prevalence and incidence of disease without any data on actual
ctiousness. For this study the authors accept the assumption, prevalence = incidence x duration
ondition (period of infectiousness), but in actual fact, as indicated on page 4, period of
ctiousness is hard to know in real life and, I maintain, is really not the same as the duration of
condition. On house to house prevalence surveys, like the 2007 Wood study in South Africa of
random adults, cases are prevalent if they have been diagnosed already but not fully treated
likely to be infectious on treatment) and also newly diagnosed, smear pos or negative
ptomatic cases - diagnosed as a result of the survey (untreated and more likely to be infectious).
ve no problem accepting an average 10 months pre-treatment infectiousness as plausible, but
ce many smear positive cases are not infectious at all and since we rarely know when in the
rse of the pre-diagnosis period infectiousness begins, the real average may be considerably
ger or shorter than 10 months.
Response: We would like to remind the reviewer that the period of infectiousness can be
asured directly or computed as the ratio of TB prevalence and incidence rate. The period of
ctiousness in South Africa has been measured directly and found to range between 8 and 12
nths [ref 17], which give the mean average of 10 moths. Additionally, the Word Health
anisation (WHO) global TB report 2015 estimated South African prevalence and incidence rates
696/100,000 and 834/100,000 respectively, which is consistent with a mean period of
ctiousness of 10 months [ref 12]. In order to give greater clarity we have added the following:
period of infectiousness is impacted by the TB control program that primarily identifies TB
es and initiates effective therapy, thereby decreasing prevalence of infective cases in the
ulation. The mean period of infectivity can be defined by direct measurement [ref 17] or
mated from TB prevalence divided by incidence rate [ref 14]. The World Health Organisation
HO) global TB report 2015 estimated South African prevalence and incidence rates at 696/100,
and 834/100, 000 respectively, which is consistent with a mean period of infectiousness of 10
nths [12]. Additionally, directly measured period of infectiousness of TB patients before
tment vary between 0.73 years (8.76 months) to 1.02 years (12.24 months) for HIV-negative,
ar negative, smear positive in South African population [ref 17]
Minor annoyances. As pointed out previously, the authors are discussing factors that might
vent SUSTAINED transmission at the population level, NOT ALL TRANSMISSION. Many of
se instances have been fixed, but others persist and should be fixed.n For example, P. 6 it says
where RAV less than 100 L/day, TB transmission is from super-spreaders. The implication is
non-superspreaders cannot transmit - but of course they can - it is less likely, and they simply
not sustain transmission at the population level and that needs to be said. There are other
ances. P5, limitations of the model - "transmission is totally aborted" but what they mean is
uced average transmission will not sustain they epidemic.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the comments. It is true that lower infectivity individuals
transmit TB settings with low RAV of les than 100 L/d after a long period of infectiousness
ugh they cannot sustain endemic transmission. In order to give greater clarity we have changed
mentioned sentence and it reads as follows:
ettings with low RAV (less than 100 L/d), sustainable endemic TB transmission occurs from
er-spreaders, while lower infectivity individuals fail to sustain endemic transmission though
y may transmit after a long period of infectiousness (more than 6 months).
have changed the sentence “transmission is totally aborted” to “reduced average transmission
l not sustain endemic”.
. is it reasonable to use 79% protection from previous infection in a largely HIV pos population -
ost certain that protection is less.
ponse: We would like to inform the reviewer that individuals with latent TB had 79% lower
of progressive tuberculosis after reinfection than uninfected individuals [19]. Several studies
e shown that HIV increases the risk of disease due to reinfection following active TB, but there
been no direct assessment of the risk of disease following reinfection among individuals with
nt infection. A recent study found that among HIV-infected individuals, the proportion of cases
stered did not differ among those with and without a history of latent TB infection, indirectly
gesting that latent infection did not provide protection from reinfection {ref 19}.
