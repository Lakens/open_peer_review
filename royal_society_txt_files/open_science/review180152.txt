This is a well written and interesting study that examines a topic that is still grossly
understudied. However, I do have some comments to make.
1) In the introduction you seem to gloss over the functional diversity of diprotodonts. While
many diprotodonts are saltatorial (I have no qualms to restricting sampled diprotodonts in the
analyses to these taxa), it should be made clear for uninformed readers that Diprotodontia also
includes wombats (Vombatidae), koalas (Phascolarctidae), and possums (Phalangeridae) - taxa
that tend to use their forelimbs pretty much for all their locomotor modes.
2) The development of the hindlimb greatly differs between marsupial and placental mammals -
could this somehow factor into the results between diprotodonts and artiodactyls and dispute or
even underscore some of your interpretations (honestly, I'm asking here - I don't have a clue
about this question myself).
3) A question in the review process asks about 'supporting data, code, and material': While you
provide data on bone length and body mass, you should strongly consider making available at
least the values of second moment of area calculated.
4) The statistical analyses need to be a bit more clearly explained. For instance, Page 6, line 228 -
it's not clear to me what test the P-values are referring to. They don't seem to correspond to those
in Tables 2 or 3. I have used smatr before, and I know that a slope can be compared to a
hypothetical value using a F-test. If the P-values are for F-tests, then this needs to be clearly
stated. Also, some of the confidence intervals you provide for coefficients of determination do not
match Tables 2 or 3 - these should be double checked. Also, one of the (F-test?) P-values
(metacarpal: 0.04), would indicate a significant departure from isometry contrary to what you
state, unless you used a Bonferroni correction or something similar. Is this the case? This
comment also applies to lines 223-225 on the same page.
5) Is the distribution/regionalization of epiphyses, metaphyses, and diapyhyses along the length
of the bone (e.g., the diaphyses starts at about 20% of the bone's length from its proximal end and
ends at 80% of the bone's length) consistent across all the species you sampled? If not, then you
might want to offer this caveat when you making comments about the scaling of metaphyses (see
Page 5, lines 202-205).
6) Looking at Figure 6, I see for some bones (e.g., the ulna when scaled against body mass) there
is a lot of overlap in confidence intervals between the two taxa. However, one scales with positive
allometry and the other with isometry. Given this overlap in confidence interval, could it really
be said that one these two groups scale differently? I understand that you assess the scaling
trends for each group by confidence interval exclusion of the critical value, but are you in a sense
throwing out some of the information by being focused on confidence interval exclusion? Though
you only have two taxa to compare, your plot(s) suggests to me that there may not be a ton of
leeway to deviate from isometry. If turns out to be true, I think this it is interesting from both a
functional and evolutionary standpoint.
3
7) This I would say is beyond the scope of the present study, but an idea for you to consider for
the future: if more clearly quadrupedal diprotodonts were sampled (e.g., kolas, wombats
possums), would you expect the humerus to scale like that of artiodactyls? If differential scaling
occurred between quadrupedal and saltatorial diprotodonts, this would give you I think and
even stronger link between forelimb function and bone scaling. Maybe you want to add a
sentence or two (even you can fit it under the word limit) about future directions of research?
8) One point to consider as you interpret your results - you refer to PIC regressions as being
'corrected.' While that is true, you should further consider that the PIC regressions are telling you
how two traits have co-evolved relative to one another (albeit assuming Brownian motion
evolution).
Overall I find this to be a valuable study, and I hope that you find my comments helpful.

In this study, the authors have attempted to identify patterns in limb bone scaling in relation to
locomotor repertoire, between modern diprotodonts and artiodactyls. Specifically, the authors
investigate whether frequent-yet-slow or irregular-yet-fast gaits dominate patterns of limb bone
scaling.
I believe the analysis is sound, and should be published with some minor amendments:
Introduction
Ln 40: “small number of novel high strain and high strain rate events with a rest period between
bouts”. I think this introductory section a little confusing. It might help if some of the information
4
in the Discussion Lns300-315 was actually included at the start. This sentence makes it sound like
the consensus is that occasional high strain events are responsible for shaping bone. Maybe a ‘yet’
at the start of the next sentence would help – “Yet repetitive loading has a saturation effect...” The
mouse example from the Discussion would exemplify this nicely here. I’d get rid of the sentence
about fatigue fractures, as it’s not particularly relevant here.
Ln 54: “pentapedal gait”. Again, it would be nice to add some of the information from the
Discussion in here, relating to the time budgets. In addition to “dominates”, you can actually put
some numbers on this statement.
Ln 57: “near-ultimate stresses”. How were these calculated? Experimentally, or estimated?
Ln 74: “foregut fermenters”. Do we have any idea about the location of the centre of mass across
these two groups? If they differ, is it fair to assume the low speed gaits (pentapedal in
diprotodonts, quadrupedal in artiodactyls) are actually comparable?
Ln 82: “hindlimbs are loaded much more intensely”. Do we actually know this though?
Throughout the Introduction I was left waiting for a reference to the actual strain data to set up
the authors’ hypothesis. Unfortunately, this data doesn’t seem to exist yet (as least in
diprotodonts). That is obviously disappointing, but I don’t think it totally undermines the
concept of the study. But I do think the authors need to make it clear earlier in the manuscript
that actual strain data does not exist, and that we’re inferring hypothetical strains on the basis on
locomotion (and force plate data?)
Ln 87: “positive allometry”. The authors frame their entire study within the concept of allometry.
They are interested in the relative similarity or difference in slopes between the study groups.
However, not all readers will be as well grounded in the concept of scaling, and the authors do
not really explain why they are expecting differences in slopes, rather than intercepts. Why
should diprotodont hindlimb cross-sections scale differently to artiodactyl hindlimbs, rather than
just having similar slopes and different intercepts i.e. being consistently smaller or larger say? It is
hinted at here in relation to PCSA etc, but need to be expanded upon.
Ln 98: “low speed pentapedal gait and quadrupedal walk”. Surely this is only true if we can
actually consider the diprotodont pentapedal gait and artiodactyl quadrupedal walk to be
equivalent in terms of stresses and strains experienced. To what extent is this the case?
Materials and Methods
Ln 114: presumably all the specimens were adult? Based on what criteria?
Ln 122: Why 100-200 slices? Why was this number chosen?
Ln 130: “Second moment of area (Imax)”. It needs to be clarified that this is maximum second
moment of area. Also, what is the justification for focusing on Imax? Compared to other cross-
sectional metrics, it is a bit ambiguous. Imax obviously has an anatomical orientation associated
with it, which isn’t reported by the authors. There are also different ‘strategies’ that could achieve
the same value of Imax, either more material closer to the principal axis, or less material
distributed further away. The authors don’t actual discuss the biomechanical implications for the
described scaling of Imax.
Ln 135-147. “Because the ratios…”. This section is really nice, very thorough reporting. Well
done.
5
Ln 141: “Images lacking HU…:. Were all those images lacking HU calibration the microCT scans?
This needs to be clarified.
Ln 160: “…which accounts for error...”. It’s not just the case that SMA allows for the incorporation
of error in the x variable. The rule of thumb is that SMA should be used when the error rate in the
x variable exceeds 1/3rd that of the y variable (McArdle, 1988)
Ln 169: Why have the authors chosen to phylogenetic independent contrasts as opposed to other
methods of phylogenetically corrected regressions (such as PGLS). PIC has the problem of losing
the intercept, and the numbers of the axes are no longer obviously interpretable as lengths, areas,
masses etc. Have the authors tested for the assumptions of PIC, such as trait evolution following
a Brownian motion model?
Ln 171: Are the two trees based on the same phylogenetic analysis? I.e. the two trees have been
cropped out of one larger tree?
Ln 178: “positive allometry”. The authors potentially need extra detail in the methods section
about the stats test used. How was ‘positive allometry’ defined? Was the slope ‘significantly’
greater than 0.33? How was this tested? Using smatr?
Ln 196: “trochlear notch and coronoid process”. Could some of these features be labelled in
Figure 5?
Ln 217: “PIC were in general slightly higher”. Are PIC are GLS slopes directly comparable? Given
the slope is being forced through the origin?
Ln 259: “range of -100 to -60 MPa”. Are these values measured or estimated?
Ln 367-378: Really nice points here. Although wouldn’t “load-related suppression of
remodelling” actually just result in more microcracking?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
This study has a substantial amount of valuable information but I worry that the paper pushes
those data into an area (focus) that is based on some poorly founded assumptions. I do not see
why the authors try to use this as a test of functional adaptation in bone, since there are so many
unknowns involved in the comparison that is made - size differences, large phylogenetic
differences (which may well translate to bone physiological differences), ecological differences,
etc. On top of that, even the functional differences between bone loading in hopping and
quadrupedal gaits are not well known (and the functional/mechanical basis of any differences
are certainly not well understood). I know it is expected that a reviewer review the paper that is
before them, and not the paper they would prefer, but I cannot help commenting that I think this
would be a far superior paper if the speculation about functional adaptation of bone were a small
comment in the discussion of a paper comparing and contrasting the skeletal scaling of these two
groups. Philosophically, I have a very difficult time with scientists who set up a hypothesis, test
it, then reject the results because they don’t agree with their pre-conceived world view. This
occurs in this paper where the authors obviously expect to see a functional adaptation effect.
When it is not seen, they resort to reaching for added effects (basically all of the discussion
following line 316).
Line 57 - re: near ultimate stress - what evidence is this statement based on?
Line 77 - typo (ask investigate)
Regarding scaling of artiodactyls as baseline (characteristic) clade. I do not agree that they are
representative of standard mammalian skeletal proportions and I think this is supported by
studies from McMahon, Christensen or Bertram. The authors themselves seem to contradict this
later in the paper (line 177 artiodactyls long limbed). This may have an important effect on
interpretation of differences between the two groups (as in line 254).
Line 87 - it should be acknowledged that this need not be functional adaptation, but selection for
structurally sound form: ie, with an adaptation/genetically determined basis.
Line 154 - the term ‘elevation’ relates to the way the relationship looks on a plot (and it is
refreshing that the authors have not made the naive error of referring to it as the ‘intercept’) but
from a mathematical standpoint I believe ‘a’ should be considered the scaling coefficient, as ‘b’ is
considered the scaling exponent (ie b is not referred to as the scaling slope).
Line 300 - why make this paper about functional adaptation when the interpretation is based on
poorly founded assumptions. If anything, this aspect could be an add-on in the discussion.
I wonder about relying only on maximum normalized 2nd moment of area to characterize cross-
section. This washes out effects of bone orientation. For instance, in the artiodactyls the
metacarpal and metatarsal fusion leaves a substantial lateral broadening of the element that may
not be meaningful (at least in a simple way) to load resistance in locomotion. That is, this
morphology represents substantial phylogenetic history effects (morphological inertia that may
actually be functionally ineffective, but may appear as some sort of advantage by the calculation
used in this study).
Line 356 - I believe I understand the statements intent regarding the term ‘within’, meaning
within each clade there appears to be no strong or systematic relationship between bone
7
geometry scaling and phylogenetic relationship. However, the paper is about a comparison
between Diprotodont and artiodactyl scaling so a reader may interpret this as a statement
meaning there is no phylogenetic signal coming from these two disparate clades - something I am
skeptical of. Possibly a mention of the result of the phylogenetic effect at that level would be
warranted.
Figures - I find the traditional scaling plots as in. Fig. 4 quite informative as the relationship
between variables is easily evaluated and the strength of relationship (and effect of outliers) can
be readily seen. It would have been nice to have a similar plot for some measure of diameter
against body mass as well, or length against diameter (a directly relevant structural feature).
Instead, these data are plotted as independent ‘b’ vs length and ‘a’ vs length, which I find very
difficult to interpret. For instance, how is it that the clearly apparent ‘elevation’ difference seen
between the metacarpals of the two clades in Fig. 4 is totally obscured in Fig. 7?

Three referees have reviewed your paper on limb bone scaling. While all three are positive about
the merits of this paper, there are significant concerns about the speculative nature of the major
claims in the paper. All three reviewers have raised concerns about assumptions related to the
functional consequences of gait differences, and that the authors have disregarded vast
phylogenetic and developmental differences between diprotodonts and atriodactyls as a factor.
As a result, I recommend that the authors considerably revise the manuscript to address all the
concerns raised.

the slope is being forced through the origin?

This study has a substantial amount of valuable information but I worry that the paper pushes
those data into an area (focus) that is based on some poorly founded assumptions. I do not see
why the authors try to use this as a test of functional adaptation in bone, since there are so many
unknowns involved in the comparison that is made - size differences, large phylogenetic
differences (which may well translate to bone physiological differences), ecological differences,
etc. On top of that, even the functional differences between bone loading in hopping and
quadrupedal gaits are not well known (and the functional/mechanical basis of any differences
are certainly not well understood). I know it is expected that a reviewer review the paper that is
before them, and not the paper they would prefer, but I cannot help commenting that I think this
would be a far superior paper if the speculation about functional adaptation of bone were a small
comment in the discussion of a paper comparing and contrasting the skeletal scaling of these two
groups. Philosophically, I have a very difficult time with scientists who set up a hypothesis, test
13
it, then reject the results because they don’t agree with their pre-conceived world view. This
occurs in this paper where the authors obviously expect to see a functional adaptation effect.
When it is not seen, they resort to reaching for added effects (basically all of the discussion
following line 316).
Line 57 - re: near ultimate stress - what evidence is this statement based on?
Line 77 - typo (ask investigate)
Regarding scaling of artiodactyls as baseline (characteristic) clade. I do not agree that they are
representative of standard mammalian skeletal proportions and I think this is supported by
studies from McMahon, Christensen or Bertram. The authors themselves seem to contradict this
later in the paper (line 177 artiodactyls long limbed). This may have an important effect on
interpretation of differences between the two groups (as in line 254).
Line 87 - it should be acknowledged that this need not be functional adaptation, but selection for
structurally sound form: ie, with an adaptation/genetically determined basis.
Line 154 - the term ‘elevation’ relates to the way the relationship looks on a plot (and it is
refreshing that the authors have not made the naive error of referring to it as the ‘intercept’) but
from a mathematical standpoint I believe ‘a’ should be considered the scaling coefficient, as ‘b’ is
considered the scaling exponent (ie b is not referred to as the scaling slope).
Line 300 - why make this paper about functional adaptation when the interpretation is based on
poorly founded assumptions. If anything, this aspect could be an add-on in the discussion.
I wonder about relying only on maximum normalized 2nd moment of area to characterize cross-
section. This washes out effects of bone orientation. For instance, in the artiodactyls the
metacarpal and metatarsal fusion leaves a substantial lateral broadening of the element that may
not be meaningful (at least in a simple way) to load resistance in locomotion. That is, this
morphology represents substantial phylogenetic history effects (morphological inertia that may
actually be functionally ineffective, but may appear as some sort of advantage by the calculation
used in this study).
Line 356 - I believe I understand the statements intent regarding the term ‘within’, meaning
within each clade there appears to be no strong or systematic relationship between bone
geometry scaling and phylogenetic relationship. However, the paper is about a comparison
between Diprotodont and artiodactyl scaling so a reader may interpret this as a statement
meaning there is no phylogenetic signal coming from these two disparate clades - something I am
skeptical of. Possibly a mention of the result of the phylogenetic effect at that level would be
warranted.
Figures - I find the traditional scaling plots as in. Fig. 4 quite informative as the relationship
between variables is easily evaluated and the strength of relationship (and effect of outliers) can
be readily seen. It would have been nice to have a similar plot for some measure of diameter
against body mass as well, or length against diameter (a directly relevant structural feature).
Instead, these data are plotted as independent ‘b’ vs length and ‘a’ vs length, which I find very
difficult to interpret. For instance, how is it that the clearly apparent ‘elevation’ difference seen
between the metacarpals of the two clades in Fig. 4 is totally obscured in Fig. 7?

I reviewed a previous version of this manuscript. I believe the authors have made considerable
amendments to the draft in response to the reviewers, and the manuscript is much improved for
this.
A few minor things occured to me on re-reading, but it's at the authors discretion if they want to
act on them:
- I'm still unclear as to why they have chosen to test for the presence of positive/negative
allometry as being the fact that the slope CI's exclude the value for isometry. This is fine, but you
can't put a confidence level on this statement. Smatr has the 'slope.test' function, which is there
explicitly to test if slopes are significantly different from a given value, and include p-values for
the test
- It strikes me as quite odd that the lambda value for Imax in the femur of artiodactyls in 0. Given
that the neighbouring tibia and metatarsals have quite strong phylogenetic signal, do you have
any idea why this might be the case?
- It occurs to me that your findings have quite important implications for palaeontologists
wishing to reconstruct locomotor performance on the basis of limb scaling. If we can't
differentiate between bipedal hopping and quadrupedal galloping in a large modern dataset,
what hope to we have of identifying potential bipedalism in ornithiscian dinosaurs for example?
Or the transition to bipedalism through hominid evolution? Obviously there are other techniques
to get at these questions, but your results imply that limb bone scaling might not be the way?

This is an interesting and informative study that adds important insight into our understanding
of bone scaling. It is well written and enjoyable to read. I have only a couple of minor points that I
feel should be addressed.
The authors note and consistently refer to the slow gait of macropods and pentapedal. While this
is true for large macropods, it becomes less so for smaller species. I expect that the smaller species
in your sample do not use the tail much at all in slow locomotion. Therefore, the authors should
consider how load distribution between forelimbs and tail may also scale in this group.
On line 67, the authors state definitively that extinct giant kangaroos could not hop. While I
believe this is likely the case, I don't believe the data exist to make this unqualified statement.

Appendix A
We thank the Associate Editor and the three Reviewers for their considered and detailed comments
on our manuscript, which have helped us to improve it. Changes to the text have been made in blue.
We agree that the focus on bone adaptation mechanisms was distracting and have significantly
revised the manuscript so that the study is now more clearly a comparison of limb bone scaling in
the context of hopping and quadrupedal locomotor styles. We have moved description of potential
mechanisms for the observed scaling patterns to the Discussion. We thank the reviewers for
pointing out to us that PIC is becoming obsolete for the reasons they mention, and we have
therefore updated our phylogenetic analysis to using a phylogenetically informed RMA method
from the popular R package phytools. The results confirm the results for scaling exponents in our
unadjusted scaling analysis despite a varying amount of phylogenetic signal (Pagel's lambda), and
therefore do not alter our conclusions.

Comments to the Author:
label_comment_14
Three referees have reviewed your paper on limb bone scaling. While all three are positive about
the merits of this paper, there are significant concerns about the speculative nature of the major
claims in the paper. All three reviewers have raised concerns about assumptions related to the
functional consequences of gait differences, and that the authors have disregarded vast
phylogenetic and developmental differences between diprotodonts and atriodactyls as a factor. As a
result, I recommend that the authors considerably revise the manuscript to address all the concerns
raised.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_15
This is a well written and interesting study that examines a topic that is still grossly understudied.
However, I do have some comments to make.
1) In the introduction you seem to gloss over the functional diversity of diprotodonts. While many
diprotodonts are saltatorial (I have no qualms to restricting sampled diprotodonts in the analyses to
these taxa), it should be made clear for uninformed readers that Diprotodontia also includes
wombats (Vombatidae), koalas (Phascolarctidae), and possums (Phalangeridae) - taxa that tend to
use their forelimbs pretty much for all their locomotor modes.
We have used only saltatorial Diprotodontia from the suborder Macropodiformes in this study,
because their hopping gait creates an interesting contrast to artiodactyls’ obligate quadrupedal gaits.
To avoid distraction by the quadrupedal members of Diprotodontia, we have changed wherever
possible in the text, captions and figures, reference to Diprotodontia and diprotodonts to
Macropodiformes and macropods.
2) The development of the hindlimb greatly differs between marsupial and placental mammals -
could this somehow factor into the results between diprotodonts and artiodactyls and dispute or
even underscore some of your interpretations (honestly, I'm asking here - I don't have a clue about
this question myself).
It is true that fetal development of limb bones differs between marsupials and placentals, in
particular in relation to the timing of mineralisation of the forelimb (earlier in marsupials,
facilitating migrating to the teat) relative to the hindlimb. By the time the young are independently
ambulatory, marsupial and placental limb bones are very similar, increasing in length through
endochondral ossification and modelling the cross-section through coordinated osteoblast/osteoclast
action. Our expectation is that at this later, juvenile, stage of growth, and during adulthood,
macropod and artiodactyl bone organs would behave very similarly, within the bounds of their
inherent drive to attain particular dimensions fitting of their species. Our basic assumption is that
mammalian bone tissue is similar between clades, so the lack of a difference between their scaling
despite their differing locomotor demands, reflects either that the phylogenetic (i.e. selected by
evolution) drive to have limbs of a certain proportion is sufficient to make the pattern we see, or
that slow gaits are sufficient to maintain bones, or both, and that high-intensity gaits don’t
necessarily relate to a more robust bone cross section (or conversely, lack of high intensity gait
loading in the macropod forelimb doesn’t result in a gracile cross-section wrt. body mass which is
what we expected to find).
3) A question in the review process asks about 'supporting data, code, and material': While you
provide data on bone length and body mass, you should strongly consider making available at least
the values of second moment of area calculated.
Full data including images and additional cross-sectional measurements, sufficient to replicate the
findings of the paper and to perform new analyses, are provided on Figshare, as described in the
Data Accessibility statement. Complete Imax data are very many; one value from every image slice of
every bone, and so are impractical to reproduce in the manuscript. They can be found in the
Slice_Geometry_results.zip file at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5631994.v1.
4) The statistical analyses need to be a bit more clearly explained. For instance, Page 6, line 228 -
it's not clear to me what test the P-values are referring to. They don't seem to correspond to those in
Tables 2 or 3. I have used smatr before, and I know that a slope can be compared to a hypothetical
value using a F-test. If the P-values are for F-tests, then this needs to be clearly stated. Also, some
of the confidence intervals you provide for coefficients of determination do not match Tables 2 or 3
- these should be double checked. Also, one of the (F-test?) P-values (metacarpal: 0.04), would
indicate a significant departure from isometry contrary to what you state, unless you used a
Bonferroni correction or something similar. Is this the case? This comment also applies to lines
223-225 on the same page.
The statistical tests and their interpretation are described in more detail in the Methods section:
“Exclusion of the exponent values for isometry (l~M, 1/3; Imax~M,4/3; Imax~l, 4) by 95% per cent
confidence intervals returned by smatr was used to test the null hypothesis of isometry, and R2 and
p from the F-test was used to test the null hypothesis of no scaling relationship between variables.”
The R2 and p values in table 2 and 3 were returned from the calls to sma() in smatr, which is a new
function included in smatr version 3. Definitions according to the smatr 3 manual,
r2 Squared correlation coefficient.

To clarify to what the p values in tables 2 and 3 refer, we have added a short explanation to their
captions, “(i.e. the p-value of the F-test of R2 against zero).” The actual test that smatr uses depends
on whether an intercept is forced; we have not forced an intercept so an F-test is performed (the call
to pf() in the code snippet below). See the source for complete details:

5) Is the distribution/regionalization of epiphyses, metaphyses, and diapyhyses along the length of
the bone (e.g., the diaphyses starts at about 20% of the bone's length from its proximal end and
ends at 80% of the bone's length) consistent across all the species you sampled? If not, then you
might want to offer this caveat when you making comments about the scaling of metaphyses (see
Page 5, lines 202-205).
The general trend in these whole-bone scaling studies is that the epiphysis and metaphysis increase
in their proportion of bone length, while the diaphysis relatively shortens with increasing animal
size, which may relate to the stronger scaling seen in cross sectional parameters in these bone
regions. We have clarified this in the main text, L260-270.
6) Looking at Figure 6, I see for some bones (e.g., the ulna when scaled against body mass) there is
a lot of overlap in confidence intervals between the two taxa. However, one scales with positive
allometry and the other with isometry. Given this overlap in confidence interval, could it really be
said that one these two groups scale differently? I understand that you assess the scaling trends for
each group by confidence interval exclusion of the critical value, but are you in a sense throwing
out some of the information by being focused on confidence interval exclusion? Though you only
have two taxa to compare, your plot(s) suggests to me that there may not be a ton of leeway to
deviate from isometry. If turns out to be true, I think this it is interesting from both a functional and
evolutionary standpoint.
Exclusion of the critical value (here, isometry) by the 95% confidence limit is a rule of thumb, with
the same effect as rejecting H0 when p < 0.05. When CIs exclude by some distance the isometry
value, allometry is clear, while when the isometry value is well-within the CIs and near the mean,
we confidently fail to reject isometry as a null hypothesis. The approach we take here is intended to
give a sense of the strength of the scaling signals as an aid to interpretation. The reviewer is correct
to point out that even though the artiodactyl and macropod ulna traces overlap nearly completely
(Fig 6f), only one excludes the isometry value from its confidence interval, leading to the seemingly
contradictory conclusion that the two clades’ ulnas scale similarly to each other but only one
displays significant positive allometry. This is an effect arising from variable confidence intervals,
an effect that is seen more clearly in the humerus (fig 6b). In the case of the ulna at 50 per cent
length, the Imax vs l slopes are different at p = 0.024 despite an 0.2 overlap in CI. Meanwhile Imax
versus M CIs overlap almost entirely with p = 0.794. We now present scaling exponents and
elevations in Table 2 for Imax versus M and l at 50 per cent length, and suggest in the figure captions
that no significant difference is a reasonable interpretation when there is substantial overlap
between CIs.
7) This I would say is beyond the scope of the present study, but an idea for you to consider for the
future: if more clearly quadrupedal diprotodonts were sampled (e.g., kolas, wombats possums),
would you expect the humerus to scale like that of artiodactyls? If differential scaling occurred
between quadrupedal and saltatorial diprotodonts, this would give you I think and even stronger
link between forelimb function and bone scaling. Maybe you want to add a sentence or two (even
you can fit it under the word limit) about future directions of research?
That’s an interesting point, given the range of locomotor styles and forelimb behaviours in the non-
saltatory, more quadrupedal diprotodonts. It seems that humeral Imax vs M is consistent between
clades in this study, but length vs mass is not, with the macropods’ humeri shorter than expected in
smaller species compared to artiodactyls (Fig 4a). Our expectation is that Imax vs mass would be
similar and that smaller non-saltatory diprotodonts have relatively longer humeri than saltatory ones
(i.e. more similar to artiodactyls), due to the level posture of habitual quadrupeds, compared to the
less asymmetrical (head-down) posture of pentapedal walking, saltatory diprotodonts. We add a
comment that comparing our results to the non-saltatory diprotodont relatives would be helpful
future work.
8) One point to consider as you interpret your results - you refer to PIC regressions as being
'corrected.' While that is true, you should further consider that the PIC regressions are telling you
how two traits have co-evolved relative to one another (albeit assuming Brownian motion
evolution).
Thank you for your suggestion, which we have incorporated into our discussion of the revised
phylogenetically-informed RMA analysis.
Overall I find this to be a valuable study, and I hope that you find my comments helpful.
Thank you for your encouragement and comments that have helped to improve the text.

Comments to the Author(s)

In this study, the authors have attempted to identify patterns in limb bone scaling in relation to
locomotor repertoire, between modern diprotodonts and artiodactyls. Specifically, the authors
investigate whether frequent-yet-slow or irregular-yet-fast gaits dominate patterns of limb bone
scaling.
I believe the analysis is sound, and should be published with some minor amendments:
Thank you for your encouragement.
Ln 40: “small number of novel high strain and high strain rate events with a rest period between
bouts”. I think this introductory section a little confusing. It might help if some of the information in
the Discussion Lns300-315 was actually included at the start. This sentence makes it sound like the
consensus is that occasional high strain events are responsible for shaping bone. Maybe a ‘yet’ at
the start of the next sentence would help – “Yet repetitive loading has a saturation effect...” The
mouse example from the Discussion would exemplify this nicely here. I’d get rid of the sentence
about fatigue fractures, as it’s not particularly relevant here.
There is a consensus from external loading experiments, such as those cited by Lanyon and
colleagues, that a small number of high strain and high strain rate events is sufficient to stimulate
bone formation. Whether fast or slow gaits, with associated high and low strains respectively, are
the dominant factors shaping bone throughout life (and across evolutionary time), is an open
question, and the one that we approach with the current data. We agree with the reviewer that this
background information works best when placed together. We have, however, moved the bulk of
this concept to the Discussion because it helps to reconcile the lack of a scaling difference despite
totally different high-speed gaits with bone loading experiments that suggest the high loads are the
important ones for bone modelling – which is only one potential explanation, alongside selection
pressure and evolutionary effects. We have also removed the sentence about fatigue fracture as we
agree that it is not relevant.
Ln 54: “pentapedal gait”. Again, it would be nice to add some of the information from the
Discussion in here, relating to the time budgets. In addition to “dominates”, you can actually put
some numbers on this statement.
We have added the tammar wallaby example to the introduction and mentioned it in context in the
Discussion.
Ln 57: “near-ultimate stresses”. How were these calculated? Experimentally, or estimated
Estimated from measurements of muscle and tendon cross-sectional areas, ground reaction forces
and moment armes, and prior measurements of ultimate stress in tendon. Full details are in the cited
paper, Snelling et al. (2017) doi:10.1111/joa.12715.
Ln 74: “foregut fermenters”. Do we have any idea about the location of the centre of mass across
these two groups? If they differ, is it fair to assume the low speed gaits (pentapedal in diprotodonts,
quadrupedal in artiodactyls) are actually comparable?
The main reason to mention the digestive strategy of these two clades is to draw an ecological
parallel between them; both groups graze and browse, and given the chance spend much of their
time lying down, standing still or walking slowly. The reviewer raises an important point, however,
that we must address. In the pentapedal gait, the forelimbs share the body mass with the tail as two
points of a tripod, but we are unaware of any forceplate data that would help us understand what
fraction of body weight is supported by each manus – 1/3, or more or less, and how that translates
to actual bone forces, because the inverse dynamics and strain gauge data do not yet exist. Such
data would also help to quantify the location and effect of the centre of mass over the stride cycle.
Artiodactyls at the walk support ¼ – ½ of body mass on each forelimb, depending on gait and stride
phase, in the same range as the macropods.
Ln 82: “hindlimbs are loaded much more intensely”. Do we actually know this though?
This sentence ends with “… during hopping”. The forelimbs do not contact the ground during
hopping, so apart from inertial forces and muscular forces required to maintain them in an elevated
position, they are not loaded at all – the ground reaction force on them is zero.
Throughout the Introduction I was left waiting for a reference to the actual strain data to set up the
authors’ hypothesis. Unfortunately, this data doesn’t seem to exist yet (as least in diprotodonts).
That is obviously disappointing, but I don’t think it totally undermines the concept of the study. But
I do think the authors need to make it clear earlier in the manuscript that actual strain data does
not exist, and that we’re inferring hypothetical strains on the basis on locomotion (and force plate
data?)
We take the point that the field lacks direct force data to make the comparisons, especially with
regard to in vivo strain gauge data (which require invasive surgery), and note this in the
introduction around line 110. There are strain data and stress calculations on the macropod extensor
tendons; Biewener & Baudinette (1995) showed that gastrocnemius tendon stress increases from
~17 MPa to ~35 MPa with increasing hopping speed from 2 - ~6.5 ms-1, however, we are missing
data on the low speed gaits. In the horse there is a clear increase (2-3 fold) in GRF and impulse
between walk, trot and gallop, measured by an instrumented horseshoe (Robin et al. 2008).
Ln 87: “positive allometry”. The authors frame their entire study within the concept of allometry.
They are interested in the relative similarity or difference in slopes between the study groups.
However, not all readers will be as well grounded in the concept of scaling, and the authors do not
really explain why they are expecting differences in slopes, rather than intercepts. Why should
diprotodont hindlimb cross-sections scale differently to artiodactyl hindlimbs, rather than just
having similar slopes and different intercepts i.e. being consistently smaller or larger say? It is
hinted at here in relation to PCSA etc, but need to be expanded upon.
Thanks for this comment. In the introduction, we explain why we expect differences in scaling
exponents – we expect to see a relative change in proportions with size in the macropods, rather
than fixed ratios between limbs and clades with size would appear as differences in elevation. We
have reworded the relevant sections (L115-130) to make this clearer.
Ln 98: “low speed pentapedal gait and quadrupedal walk”. Surely this is only true if we can
actually consider the diprotodont pentapedal gait and artiodactyl quadrupedal walk to be
equivalent in terms of stresses and strains experienced. To what extent is this the case?
As we write in our reply to your earlier question, in the pentapedal gait, the forelimbs share the
body mass with the tail as two points of a tripod, but we are unaware of any forceplate data that
would help us understand what fraction of body weight is supported by each manus – 1/3, or more
or less, and how that translates to actual bone forces, because the inverse dynamics and strain gauge
data do not yet exist. Such data would also help to quantify the location and effect of the centre of
mass over the stride cycle. Artiodactyls at the walk support ¼ – ½ of body mass on each forelimb,
depending on gait and stride phase, in the same range as the macropods. The main point here is
really that the high speed gaits engender much higher strains and strain rates than the low speed
gaits, and since the macropod forelimb is unused in the high speed gait, this should be apparent in
the scaling signal, if high speed gaits are the dominant factor in bone geometric adaptation by
phenotypic or genotypic adaptation.
Materials and Methods
Ln 114: presumably all the specimens were adult? Based on what criteria?
Added “All specimens were skeletally mature as determined by fusion of the growth plates, and free
from obvious skeletal disease.”, to clarify this point.
Ln 122: Why 100-200 slices? Why was this number chosen?
It gives adequate resolution in the axial (proximodistal, image z-axis) direction, without producing
large amounts of unnecessary data. Cross-sectional measurements were later averaged into groups
of 5%-iles.
Ln 130: “Second moment of area (Imax)”. It needs to be clarified that this is maximum second
moment of area. Also, what is the justification for focusing on Imax? Compared to other cross-
sectional metrics, it is a bit ambiguous. Imax obviously has an anatomical orientation associated
with it, which isn’t reported by the authors. There are also different ‘strategies’ that could achieve
the same value of Imax, either more material closer to the principal axis, or less material
distributed further away. The authors don’t actual discuss the biomechanical implications for the
described scaling of Imax.
We use Imax as a geometric descriptor of cross-sectional size and disposition rather than as a direct
proxy of bending stiffness, because principal axes don’t usually align with the neutral plane of
bending (see the Lieberman et al. paper now cited in the methods section). We do discuss Imax in
relation to locomotor biomechanics throughout the text, in particular with regard to the question:
what aspects of the biomechanical environment (especially with regard to gait) could explain the
Imax scaling we observe? While we did collect CSA data, we chose to report Imax because it is the
most mechanically relevant expression of the geometry; an increase in Imax has implications for
strength in bending where an increase in CSA alone does not. The reviewer is correct to point out
that Imax can change independently of CSA; such an effect can be large when comparing animals
with radically different skeletal strategies and phylogenies (e.g. avian vs. mammalian femora in Fig.
4 of Doube et al. 2012 doi:10.1111/j.1469-7580.2012.01514.x). A comparison of all the variables to
investigate their interactions is beyond the scope of this work, and could be undertaken by anyone –
they are welcome to the full data which are online at Figshare.
Ln 135-147. “Because the ratios…”. This section is really nice, very thorough reporting. Well done.
Thank you.
Ln 141: “Images lacking HU…:. Were all those images lacking HU calibration the microCT scans?
This needs to be clarified.
That is correct, added “XMT images...”
Ln 160: “…which accounts for error...”. It’s not just the case that SMA allows for the incorporation
of error in the x variable. The rule of thumb is that SMA should be used when the error rate in the x
variable exceeds 1/3rd that of the y variable (McArdle, 1988)
We thank the reviewer for this comment. We would like to point out that, according to the more
recent literature on line-fitting in allometry that we cite (Warton et al., 2006), information on the
error should not be used to decide on the line fitting method, since the “equation error” is typically
large in allometric studies, including ours. We would have liked to be able to account for
measurement error, but this would have required performing the study with several individuals per
species, which was impossible to do given the rare material sampled – a typical limitation of studies
on exotic museum specimens.
Ln 169: Why have the authors chosen to phylogenetic independent contrasts as opposed to other
methods of phylogenetically corrected regressions (such as PGLS). PIC has the problem of losing
the intercept, and the numbers of the axes are no longer obviously interpretable as lengths, areas,
masses etc. Have the authors tested for the assumptions of PIC, such as trait evolution following a
Brownian motion model?
We now perform phylogenetically-informed RMA with phytools rather than PIC, thanks to this
comment.
Ln 171: Are the two trees based on the same phylogenetic analysis? I.e. the two trees have been
cropped out of one larger tree?
Yes, both trees were cropped out based on the paper by Bininda-Emonds et al. We have clarified
this in the relevant sentence.
Ln 178: “positive allometry”. The authors potentially need extra detail in the methods section
about the stats test used. How was ‘positive allometry’ defined? Was the slope ‘significantly’ greater
than 0.33? How was this tested? Using smatr?
We have added an introduction to scaling analysis in the materials and methods to aid readers to
whom this approach is new, and an explicit description of testing the null hypotheses of isometry
and size invariance.
Ln 196: “trochlear notch and coronoid process”. Could some of these features be labelled in
Figure 5?
Dashed lines have been added to Fig. 5 to indicate the trochlear notch, and noted in the figure
caption.
Ln 217: “PIC were in general slightly higher”. Are PIC are GLS slopes directly comparable?
Given the slope is being forced through the origin?
We have replaced PIC with phylogenetically-informed RMA analysis and taken this comment into
account in our description of the results.
Ln 259: “range of -100 to -60 MPa”. Are these values measured or estimated?
They are calculated from force plate and video / cine data of hopping kangaroos, as described on
pp. 289-90 of Alexander & Vernon (1975).
Ln 367-378: Really nice points here. Although wouldn’t “load-related suppression of remodelling”
actually just result in more microcracking?
It might, according to some concepts of microcracking, although microcracks can self-anneal
without needing remodelling for repair (e.g. Boyde 2003 doi:10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00213.x).
Further investigation of comparative tissue-level adaptations in macropod bone would be interesting
but outside the scope of the current paper.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_17
This study has a substantial amount of valuable information but I worry that the paper pushes those
data into an area (focus) that is based on some poorly founded assumptions. I do not see why the
authors try to use this as a test of functional adaptation in bone, since there are so many unknowns
involved in the comparison that is made - size differences, large phylogenetic differences (which
may well translate to bone physiological differences), ecological differences, etc. On top of that,
even the functional differences between bone loading in hopping and quadrupedal gaits are not
well known (and the functional/mechanical basis of any differences are certainly not well
understood). I know it is expected that a reviewer review the paper that is before them, and not the
paper they would prefer, but I cannot help commenting that I think this would be a far superior
paper if the speculation about functional adaptation of bone were a small comment in the
discussion of a paper comparing and contrasting the skeletal scaling of these two groups.
Philosophically, I have a very difficult time with scientists who set up a hypothesis, test it, then
reject the results because they don’t agree with their pre-conceived world view. This occurs in this
paper where the authors obviously expect to see a functional adaptation effect. When it is not seen,
they resort to reaching for added effects (basically all of the discussion following line 316).
It seems a reasonable hypothesis that due to their use only in the low-speed pentapedal gait, that
macropods’ forelimb bones should scale weakly compared to hindlimb bones and to artiodactyl
forelimb bones, which are loaded in high speed gaits. This would correspond to generally accepted
aspects of mammalian bone physiology, in which during development, growth and adulthood (and
over evolution), bones adapt to their load environment to maintain loads within a safe range. It
would also make sense from an evolutionary standpoint, that those organs that are heavily used
become more robust, while those that are not, become vestigial (e.g. pelvic and thoracic limbs of
Apterygidae). From a bone physiology standpoint, the loads that are most stimulatory, and which
can cause substantial modelling in the adult, are high strains and high strain rates of the kind seen
during high energy activity such as running and jump landings. So we do “expect to see a functional
adaptation effect” based on the prior literature. This is not a ‘pre-conceived world view’ it is the
accepted science that we are aware of. We have only ‘rejected the results’ where the statistical tests
fail to reject H0. We seek to explain our findings as well as we can based on what is known, and
speculate sensibly to guide future investigations. (i.e. that rather than high magnitude and rates of
loading from infrequent loads underlying scaling, perhaps very regular, lower magnitude and rates
of loading are as/more important; in these two clades sampled). Nowhere do we dismiss the data or
the numerical analysis – we have a readout and want to know what it means. We welcome
alternative suggestions.
In response to this criticism we have moved the bulk of the description of bone modelling
physiology to the discussion to make clear that it is one of several potential explanations for the
scaling patterns that we observe.
Line 57 - re: near ultimate stress - what evidence is this statement based on?
Estimated from measurements of muscle and tendon cross-sectional areas, ground reaction forces
and moment armes, and prior measurements of ultimate stress in tendon. Full details are in the cited
paper, Snelling et al. (2017) doi:10.1111/joa.12715.
Line 77 - typo (ask investigate)
Corrected, thank you.
Regarding scaling of artiodactyls as baseline (characteristic) clade. I do not agree that they are
representative of standard mammalian skeletal proportions and I think this is supported by studies
from McMahon, Christensen or Bertram. The authors themselves seem to contradict this later in
the paper (line 177 artiodactyls long limbed). This may have an important effect on interpretation
of differences between the two groups (as in line 254).
Artiodactyls might not be a taxonomic baseline but they are much more “representative” in
conformation and behaviour than the macropods, by displaying the most typical, quadrupedal, gaits
exclusively, compared to the unusual bipedal hopping of the macropods (another famous hopping
mammal example is jerboas, but these do not have the same body mass range of macropods and so
are unsuitable for a scaling study). Artiodactyls also have the advantage of a relatively broad range
of body mass from 1-2 kg (mouse-deer) to several tonnes (hippopotamus), with representatives at
each order of magnitude. We have changed the wording to remove the implication that artiodactyls
represent the ancestral condition of mammals, and to emphasise the reason for using them in this
study, which is that they are quadrupedal, and a convenient taxon to sample from.
Line 87 - it should be acknowledged that this need not be functional adaptation, but selection for
structurally sound form: ie, with an adaptation/genetically determined basis.
Yes, good point, this is another alternative explanation for the lack of difference between fore- and
hind and artiodactyl/macropod – the shape is set earlier (evolution, development, growth), than
maintained only by adult activity. We now mention development, growth and evolution in the
Introduction and Discussion to provide this important perspective.
Line 154 - the term ‘elevation’ relates to the way the relationship looks on a plot (and it is
refreshing that the authors have not made the naive error of referring to it as the ‘intercept’) but
from a mathematical standpoint I believe ‘a’ should be considered the scaling coefficient, as ‘b’ is
considered the scaling exponent (ie b is not referred to as the scaling slope).
Thanks for pointing this out, we have corrected a from ‘elevation’ to ‘coefficient’. The case of ‘b’ is
less straightforward. In the original power expression b is the exponent, but after log transformation
b is the slope of the linear function that is fitted by the regression calculation, so it is equally valid
to refer to b as either an exponent or a slope, but incorrect to refer to a as the elevation (or
intercept), which is log(a). We explain this in the Methods, L184-190.
Line 300 - why make this paper about functional adaptation when the interpretation is based on
poorly founded assumptions. If anything, this aspect could be an add-on in the discussion.
The paper is about which events in the loading history have the dominant effect on skeletal
proportions. Skeletal physiology as understood today would lead to the assumption that high (and
unusual) mechanical loads have the greatest effect on adult bone cross-sectional parameters,
compared to the more frequent loads engendered by low-speed activity. It is also curious that
evolution has not favoured a diminution of forelimb, and enhancement of hind limb proportions, in
large hopping bipeds. Thanks to this reviewer’s points we have revised the manuscript to be more
circumspect about mechanisms for the scaling patterns that we measure.
I wonder about relying only on maximum normalized 2nd moment of area to characterize cross-
section. This washes out effects of bone orientation. For instance, in the artiodactyls the
metacarpal and metatarsal fusion leaves a substantial lateral broadening of the element that may
not be meaningful (at least in a simple way) to load resistance in locomotion. That is, this
morphology represents substantial phylogenetic history effects (morphological inertia that may
actually be functionally ineffective, but may appear as some sort of advantage by the calculation
used in this study).
This is a consideration that we have thought about at length. In the first instance, Imax and Imin (and
the related measurements, J, Z and CSA) correlate very closely, so there is little explanatory value
for this kind of study to report them all; the paper would rapidly become unwieldy with many more
plots and the statistics become weaker with repeated measures of essentially the same property. This
is mentioned in the Methods section. There is a tradeoff in using Imax alone, which the reviewer has
identified, which is that eccentricity is not accounted for in regions like the tibial crest, or the
artiodactyl metacarpal, where the profile is eccentric. On the other hand, limb segments like the
antebrachium and the manus are problematic because the radius and ulna are loaded together, but
analysed separately, while the diprotodont Mc3 has its 4 neighbouring metacarpals spreading the
load alongside it.
It is important to recognise that although I has a meaning in the context of beam theory, here we use
it mainly as a geometric descriptor, that encapsulates an estimate of the size and disposition of bone
material in the cross-section. Extrapolating geometrically calculated I to real performance in
bending is fraught because the principal axes do not usually correspond to the neutral plane of
bending, which we now mention in the Methods.
Line 356 - I believe I understand the statements intent regarding the term ‘within’, meaning within
each clade there appears to be no strong or systematic relationship between bone geometry scaling
and phylogenetic relationship. However, the paper is about a comparison between Diprotodont and
artiodactyl scaling so a reader may interpret this as a statement meaning there is no phylogenetic
signal coming from these two disparate clades - something I am skeptical of. Possibly a mention of
the result of the phylogenetic effect at that level would be warranted.
Our new analyses (using phylogenetic RMA as per comments above) do show some phylogenetic
signal within clades in some cases, but there is no very strong phylogenetic signal overall; or better
said, our fundamental conclusions do not hang on whether a phylogenetically-informed analysis is
used or not. That is clear in the current MS. The reviewer’s other point is interesting. Both clades
are independently specialized and thus have undergone their own phylogenetic transformations in
form and function (e.g. hopping macropods; cursorial artiodactyls with a broad size range). The
within-clade scaling patterns are, in a broader context, indicative of this independent specialization.
We have done prior studies of felid (cat) species and bird species using similar methods and the
scaling patterns we find in the current study suggest some broader phylogenetic patterns, such as the
general trend for “universal” scaling of stylopodial dimensions (see main text), or trends common to
artiodactyls and felids (e.g. mild allometry of some limb bones).
Figures - I find the traditional scaling plots as in. Fig. 4 quite informative as the relationship
between variables is easily evaluated and the strength of relationship (and effect of outliers) can be
readily seen. It would have been nice to have a similar plot for some measure of diameter against
body mass as well, or length against diameter (a directly relevant structural feature). Instead, these
data are plotted as independent ‘b’ vs length and ‘a’ vs length, which I find very difficult to
interpret. For instance, how is it that the clearly apparent ‘elevation’ difference seen between the
metacarpals of the two clades in Fig. 4 is totally obscured in Fig. 7?
We appreciate that the scaling exponent vs per cent length plots are somewhat unfamiliar. We do
find them – alongside the normalised Imax versus per cent length plots - very rewarding in terms of
revealing relationships that may otherwise be missed if we confined ourselves to calculating
exponents and coefficients only at 50% length, because structural adaptation occurs throughout the
bone organ and not only in the mid-diaphysis. To aid the reader we have included plots of Imax
versus mass and Imax versus length at 50% of length in figure 4. To answer the final point – the
elevation difference between metacarpal regressions in figure 4 is not shown in figure 7, because
figure 4a-g displays l versus M, while figure 7 plots elevations of Imax versus l and Imax versus M, so
they are not the same variables to compare.

Three referees have reviewed your paper on limb bone scaling. While all three are positive about
21
22 the merits of this paper, there are significant concerns about the speculative nature of the major
23 claims in the paper. All three reviewers have raised concerns about assumptions related to the
24 functional consequences of gait differences, and that the authors have disregarded vast
25 phylogenetic and developmental differences between diprotodonts and atriodactyls as a factor. As a
26 result, I recommend that the authors considerably revise the manuscript to address all the concerns
27 raised.

34 This is a well written and interesting study that examines a topic that is still grossly understudied.
35
However, I do have some comments to make.
36
37
38 1) In the introduction you seem to gloss over the functional diversity of diprotodonts. While many
39 diprotodonts are saltatorial (I have no qualms to restricting sampled diprotodonts in the analyses to
40 these taxa), it should be made clear for uninformed readers that Diprotodontia also includes
41 wombats (Vombatidae), koalas (Phascolarctidae), and possums (Phalangeridae) - taxa that tend to
42 use their forelimbs pretty much for all their locomotor modes.
43
44
45 We have used only saltatorial Diprotodontia from the suborder Macropodiformes in this study,
46 because their hopping gait creates an interesting contrast to artiodactyls’ obligate quadrupedal gaits.
47 To avoid distraction by the quadrupedal members of Diprotodontia, we have changed wherever
48 possible in the text, captions and figures, reference to Diprotodontia and diprotodonts to
49 Macropodiformes and macropods.
50
51
52
2) The development of the hindlimb greatly differs between marsupial and placental mammals -
53 could this somehow factor into the results between diprotodonts and artiodactyls and dispute or
54 even underscore some of your interpretations (honestly, I'm asking here - I don't have a clue about
55 this question myself).
56
57 It is true that fetal development of limb bones differs between marsupials and placentals, in
58
particular in relation to the timing of mineralisation of the forelimb (earlier in marsupials,
59
60 facilitating migrating to the teat) relative to the hindlimb. By the time the young are independently
ambulatory, marsupial and placental limb bones are very similar, increasing in length through

4 macropod and artiodactyl bone organs would behave very similarly, within the bounds of their
5
6
inherent drive to attain particular dimensions fitting of their species. Our basic assumption is that
7 mammalian bone tissue is similar between clades, so the lack of a difference between their scaling
8 despite their differing locomotor demands, reflects either that the phylogenetic (i.e. selected by
9 evolution) drive to have limbs of a certain proportion is sufficient to make the pattern we see, or
10 that slow gaits are sufficient to maintain bones, or both, and that high-intensity gaits don’t
11 necessarily relate to a more robust bone cross section (or conversely, lack of high intensity gait
12
loading in the macropod forelimb doesn’t result in a gracile cross-section wrt. body mass which is
13
14 what we expected to find).
15
16 3) A question in the review process asks about 'supporting data, code, and material': While you
17 provide data on bone length and body mass, you should strongly consider making available at least
18 the values of second moment of area calculated.
19
20
Full data including images and additional cross-sectional measurements, sufficient to replicate the
21
22 findings of the paper and to perform new analyses, are provided on Figshare, as described in the
23 Data Accessibility statement. Complete Imax data are very many; one value from every image slice of
24 every bone, and so are impractical to reproduce in the manuscript. They can be found in the
25 Slice_Geometry_results.zip file at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5631994.v1.
26
27 4) The statistical analyses need to be a bit more clearly explained. For instance, Page 6, line 228 -
28
29
it's not clear to me what test the P-values are referring to. They don't seem to correspond to those in
30 Tables 2 or 3. I have used smatr before, and I know that a slope can be compared to a hypothetical
31 value using a F-test. If the P-values are for F-tests, then this needs to be clearly stated. Also, some
32 of the confidence intervals you provide for coefficients of determination do not match Tables 2 or 3
33 - these should be double checked. Also, one of the (F-test?) P-values (metacarpal: 0.04), would
34 indicate a significant departure from isometry contrary to what you state, unless you used a
35
Bonferroni correction or something similar. Is this the case? This comment also applies to lines
36
37 223-225 on the same page.
38
39 The statistical tests and their interpretation are described in more detail in the Methods section:
40 “Exclusion of the exponent values for isometry (l~M, 1/3; Imax~M,4/3; Imax~l, 4) by 95% per cent
41 confidence intervals returned by smatr was used to test the null hypothesis of isometry, and R2 and
42
p from the F-test was used to test the null hypothesis of no scaling relationship between variables.”
43
44
45 The R2 and p values in table 2 and 3 were returned from the calls to sma() in smatr, which is a new
46 function included in smatr version 3. Definitions according to the smatr 3 manual,

To clarify to what the p values in tables 2 and 3 refer, we have added a short explanation to their

30 on whether an intercept is forced; we have not forced an intercept so an F-test is performed (the call
31 to pf() in the code snippet below). See the source for complete details:

45 5) Is the distribution/regionalization of epiphyses, metaphyses, and diapyhyses along the length of
46 the bone (e.g., the diaphyses starts at about 20% of the bone's length from its proximal end and
47 ends at 80% of the bone's length) consistent across all the species you sampled? If not, then you
48
might want to offer this caveat when you making comments about the scaling of metaphyses (see
49
50 Page 5, lines 202-205).
51
52 The general trend in these whole-bone scaling studies is that the epiphysis and metaphysis increase
53 in their proportion of bone length, while the diaphysis relatively shortens with increasing animal
54 size, which may relate to the stronger scaling seen in cross sectional parameters in these bone
55 regions. We have clarified this in the main text, L260-270.
56
57
58 6) Looking at Figure 6, I see for some bones (e.g., the ulna when scaled against body mass) there is
59 a lot of overlap in confidence intervals between the two taxa. However, one scales with positive
60 allometry and the other with isometry. Given this overlap in confidence interval, could it really be
said that one these two groups scale differently? I understand that you assess the scaling trends for
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 4 of 48
1
2 each group by confidence interval exclusion of the critical value, but are you in a sense throwing
3 out some of the information by being focused on confidence interval exclusion? Though you only
4 have two taxa to compare, your plot(s) suggests to me that there may not be a ton of leeway to
5
6
deviate from isometry. If turns out to be true, I think this it is interesting from both a functional and
7 evolutionary standpoint.
8
9 Exclusion of the critical value (here, isometry) by the 95% confidence limit is a rule of thumb, with
10 the same effect as rejecting H0 when p < 0.05. When CIs exclude by some distance the isometry
11 value, allometry is clear, while when the isometry value is well-within the CIs and near the mean,
12
we confidently fail to reject isometry as a null hypothesis. The approach we take here is intended to
13
14 give a sense of the strength of the scaling signals as an aid to interpretation. The reviewer is correct
15 to point out that even though the artiodactyl and macropod ulna traces overlap nearly completely
16 (Fig 6f), only one excludes the isometry value from its confidence interval, leading to the seemingly
17 contradictory conclusion that the two clades’ ulnas scale similarly to each other but only one
18 displays significant positive allometry. This is an effect arising from variable confidence intervals,
19 an effect that is seen more clearly in the humerus (fig 6b). In the case of the ulna at 50 per cent
20
length, the Imax vs l slopes are different at p = 0.024 despite an 0.2 overlap in CI. Meanwhile Imax
21
22 versus M CIs overlap almost entirely with p = 0.794. We now present scaling exponents and
23 elevations in Table 2 for Imax versus M and l at 50 per cent length, and suggest in the figure captions
24 that no significant difference is a reasonable interpretation when there is substantial overlap
25 between CIs.
26
27 7) This I would say is beyond the scope of the present study, but an idea for you to consider for the
28
29
future: if more clearly quadrupedal diprotodonts were sampled (e.g., kolas, wombats possums),
30 would you expect the humerus to scale like that of artiodactyls? If differential scaling occurred
31 between quadrupedal and saltatorial diprotodonts, this would give you I think and even stronger
32 link between forelimb function and bone scaling. Maybe you want to add a sentence or two (even
33 you can fit it under the word limit) about future directions of research?
34
35
That’s an interesting point, given the range of locomotor styles and forelimb behaviours in the non-
36
37 saltatory, more quadrupedal diprotodonts. It seems that humeral Imax vs M is consistent between
38 clades in this study, but length vs mass is not, with the macropods’ humeri shorter than expected in
39 smaller species compared to artiodactyls (Fig 4a). Our expectation is that Imax vs mass would be
40 similar and that smaller non-saltatory diprotodonts have relatively longer humeri than saltatory ones
41 (i.e. more similar to artiodactyls), due to the level posture of habitual quadrupeds, compared to the
42 less asymmetrical (head-down) posture of pentapedal walking, saltatory diprotodonts. We add a
43
comment that comparing our results to the non-saltatory diprotodont relatives would be helpful
44
45 future work.
46
47 8) One point to consider as you interpret your results - you refer to PIC regressions as being
48 'corrected.' While that is true, you should further consider that the PIC regressions are telling you
49 how two traits have co-evolved relative to one another (albeit assuming Brownian motion
50 evolution).
51
52
Thank you for your suggestion, which we have incorporated into our discussion of the revised
53 phylogenetically-informed RMA analysis.
54
55 Overall I find this to be a valuable study, and I hope that you find my comments helpful.
56 Thank you for your encouragement and comments that have helped to improve the text.

2 In this study, the authors have attempted to identify patterns in limb bone scaling in relation to
3 locomotor repertoire, between modern diprotodonts and artiodactyls. Specifically, the authors
4 investigate whether frequent-yet-slow or irregular-yet-fast gaits dominate patterns of limb bone
5
6
scaling.
7
8 I believe the analysis is sound, and should be published with some minor amendments:
9 Thank you for your encouragement.
10
11 Ln 40: “small number of novel high strain and high strain rate events with a rest period between
12
bouts”. I think this introductory section a little confusing. It might help if some of the information in
13
14 the Discussion Lns300-315 was actually included at the start. This sentence makes it sound like the
15 consensus is that occasional high strain events are responsible for shaping bone. Maybe a ‘yet’ at
16 the start of the next sentence would help – “Yet repetitive loading has a saturation effect...” The
17 mouse example from the Discussion would exemplify this nicely here. I’d get rid of the sentence
18 about fatigue fractures, as it’s not particularly relevant here.
19
20
There is a consensus from external loading experiments, such as those cited by Lanyon and
21
22 colleagues, that a small number of high strain and high strain rate events is sufficient to stimulate
23 bone formation. Whether fast or slow gaits, with associated high and low strains respectively, are
24 the dominant factors shaping bone throughout life (and across evolutionary time), is an open
25 question, and the one that we approach with the current data. We agree with the reviewer that this
26 background information works best when placed together. We have, however, moved the bulk of
27 this concept to the Discussion because it helps to reconcile the lack of a scaling difference despite
28
29
totally different high-speed gaits with bone loading experiments that suggest the high loads are the
30 important ones for bone modelling – which is only one potential explanation, alongside selection
31 pressure and evolutionary effects. We have also removed the sentence about fatigue fracture as we
32 agree that it is not relevant.
33
34 Ln 54: “pentapedal gait”. Again, it would be nice to add some of the information from the
35
Discussion in here, relating to the time budgets. In addition to “dominates”, you can actually put
36
37 some numbers on this statement.
38 We have added the tammar wallaby example to the introduction and mentioned it in context in the
39 Discussion.
40
41 Ln 57: “near-ultimate stresses”. How were these calculated? Experimentally, or estimated
42 Estimated from measurements of muscle and tendon cross-sectional areas, ground reaction forces
43
and moment armes, and prior measurements of ultimate stress in tendon. Full details are in the cited
44
45 paper, Snelling et al. (2017) doi:10.1111/joa.12715.
46
47 Ln 74: “foregut fermenters”. Do we have any idea about the location of the centre of mass across
48 these two groups? If they differ, is it fair to assume the low speed gaits (pentapedal in diprotodonts,
49 quadrupedal in artiodactyls) are actually comparable?
50 The main reason to mention the digestive strategy of these two clades is to draw an ecological
51
52
parallel between them; both groups graze and browse, and given the chance spend much of their
53 time lying down, standing still or walking slowly. The reviewer raises an important point, however,
54 that we must address. In the pentapedal gait, the forelimbs share the body mass with the tail as two
55 points of a tripod, but we are unaware of any forceplate data that would help us understand what
56 fraction of body weight is supported by each manus – 1/3, or more or less, and how that translates
57 to actual bone forces, because the inverse dynamics and strain gauge data do not yet exist. Such
58
data would also help to quantify the location and effect of the centre of mass over the stride cycle.
59
60 Artiodactyls at the walk support ¼ – ½ of body mass on each forelimb, depending on gait and stride
phase, in the same range as the macropods.

2
3 Ln 82: “hindlimbs are loaded much more intensely”. Do we actually know this though?
4 This sentence ends with “… during hopping”. The forelimbs do not contact the ground during
5
6
hopping, so apart from inertial forces and muscular forces required to maintain them in an elevated
7 position, they are not loaded at all – the ground reaction force on them is zero.
8
9 Throughout the Introduction I was left waiting for a reference to the actual strain data to set up the
10 authors’ hypothesis. Unfortunately, this data doesn’t seem to exist yet (as least in diprotodonts).
11 That is obviously disappointing, but I don’t think it totally undermines the concept of the study. But
12
I do think the authors need to make it clear earlier in the manuscript that actual strain data does
13
14 not exist, and that we’re inferring hypothetical strains on the basis on locomotion (and force plate
15 data?)
16 We take the point that the field lacks direct force data to make the comparisons, especially with
17 regard to in vivo strain gauge data (which require invasive surgery), and note this in the
18 introduction around line 110. There are strain data and stress calculations on the macropod extensor
19 tendons; Biewener & Baudinette (1995) showed that gastrocnemius tendon stress increases from
20
~17 MPa to ~35 MPa with increasing hopping speed from 2 - ~6.5 ms-1, however, we are missing
21
22 data on the low speed gaits. In the horse there is a clear increase (2-3 fold) in GRF and impulse
23 between walk, trot and gallop, measured by an instrumented horseshoe (Robin et al. 2008).
24
25 Ln 87: “positive allometry”. The authors frame their entire study within the concept of allometry.
26 They are interested in the relative similarity or difference in slopes between the study groups.
27 However, not all readers will be as well grounded in the concept of scaling, and the authors do not
28
29
really explain why they are expecting differences in slopes, rather than intercepts. Why should
30 diprotodont hindlimb cross-sections scale differently to artiodactyl hindlimbs, rather than just
31 having similar slopes and different intercepts i.e. being consistently smaller or larger say? It is
32 hinted at here in relation to PCSA etc, but need to be expanded upon.
33 Thanks for this comment. In the introduction, we explain why we expect differences in scaling
34 exponents – we expect to see a relative change in proportions with size in the macropods, rather
35
than fixed ratios between limbs and clades with size would appear as differences in elevation. We
36
37 have reworded the relevant sections (L115-130) to make this clearer.
38
39 Ln 98: “low speed pentapedal gait and quadrupedal walk”. Surely this is only true if we can
40 actually consider the diprotodont pentapedal gait and artiodactyl quadrupedal walk to be
41 equivalent in terms of stresses and strains experienced. To what extent is this the case?
42 As we write in our reply to your earlier question, in the pentapedal gait, the forelimbs share the
43
body mass with the tail as two points of a tripod, but we are unaware of any forceplate data that
44
45 would help us understand what fraction of body weight is supported by each manus – 1/3, or more
46 or less, and how that translates to actual bone forces, because the inverse dynamics and strain gauge
47 data do not yet exist. Such data would also help to quantify the location and effect of the centre of
48 mass over the stride cycle. Artiodactyls at the walk support ¼ – ½ of body mass on each forelimb,
49 depending on gait and stride phase, in the same range as the macropods. The main point here is
50 really that the high speed gaits engender much higher strains and strain rates than the low speed
51
52
gaits, and since the macropod forelimb is unused in the high speed gait, this should be apparent in
53 the scaling signal, if high speed gaits are the dominant factor in bone geometric adaptation by
54 phenotypic or genotypic adaptation.
55
56 Materials and Methods
57 Ln 114: presumably all the specimens were adult? Based on what criteria?
58
Added “All specimens were skeletally mature as determined by fusion of the growth plates, and free
59
60 from obvious skeletal disease.”, to clarify this point.

1
2 Ln 122: Why 100-200 slices? Why was this number chosen?
3 It gives adequate resolution in the axial (proximodistal, image z-axis) direction, without producing
4 large amounts of unnecessary data. Cross-sectional measurements were later averaged into groups
5
6
of 5%-iles.
7
8 Ln 130: “Second moment of area (Imax)”. It needs to be clarified that this is maximum second
9 moment of area. Also, what is the justification for focusing on Imax? Compared to other cross-
10 sectional metrics, it is a bit ambiguous. Imax obviously has an anatomical orientation associated
11 with it, which isn’t reported by the authors. There are also different ‘strategies’ that could achieve
12
the same value of Imax, either more material closer to the principal axis, or less material
13
14 distributed further away. The authors don’t actual discuss the biomechanical implications for the
15 described scaling of Imax.
16
17 We use Imax as a geometric descriptor of cross-sectional size and disposition rather than as a direct
18 proxy of bending stiffness, because principal axes don’t usually align with the neutral plane of
19 bending (see the Lieberman et al. paper now cited in the methods section). We do discuss Imax in
20
relation to locomotor biomechanics throughout the text, in particular with regard to the question:
21
22 what aspects of the biomechanical environment (especially with regard to gait) could explain the
23 Imax scaling we observe? While we did collect CSA data, we chose to report Imax because it is the
24 most mechanically relevant expression of the geometry; an increase in Imax has implications for
25 strength in bending where an increase in CSA alone does not. The reviewer is correct to point out
26 that Imax can change independently of CSA; such an effect can be large when comparing animals
27 with radically different skeletal strategies and phylogenies (e.g. avian vs. mammalian femora in Fig.
28
29
4 of Doube et al. 2012 doi:10.1111/j.1469-7580.2012.01514.x). A comparison of all the variables to
30 investigate their interactions is beyond the scope of this work, and could be undertaken by anyone –
31 they are welcome to the full data which are online at Figshare.
32
33 Ln 135-147. “Because the ratios…”. This section is really nice, very thorough reporting. Well done.
34 Thank you.
35
36
37 Ln 141: “Images lacking HU…:. Were all those images lacking HU calibration the microCT scans?
38 This needs to be clarified.
39 That is correct, added “XMT images...”
40
41 Ln 160: “…which accounts for error...”. It’s not just the case that SMA allows for the incorporation
42 of error in the x variable. The rule of thumb is that SMA should be used when the error rate in the x
43
variable exceeds 1/3rd that of the y variable (McArdle, 1988)
44
45 We thank the reviewer for this comment. We would like to point out that, according to the more
46 recent literature on line-fitting in allometry that we cite (Warton et al., 2006), information on the
47 error should not be used to decide on the line fitting method, since the “equation error” is typically
48 large in allometric studies, including ours. We would have liked to be able to account for
49 measurement error, but this would have required performing the study with several individuals per
50 species, which was impossible to do given the rare material sampled – a typical limitation of studies
51
52
on exotic museum specimens.
53
54 Ln 169: Why have the authors chosen to phylogenetic independent contrasts as opposed to other
55 methods of phylogenetically corrected regressions (such as PGLS). PIC has the problem of losing
56 the intercept, and the numbers of the axes are no longer obviously interpretable as lengths, areas,
57 masses etc. Have the authors tested for the assumptions of PIC, such as trait evolution following a
58
Brownian motion model?
59
60 We now perform phylogenetically-informed RMA with phytools rather than PIC, thanks to this
comment.

6
Yes, both trees were cropped out based on the paper by Bininda-Emonds et al. We have clarified
7 this in the relevant sentence.
8
9 Ln 178: “positive allometry”. The authors potentially need extra detail in the methods section
10 about the stats test used. How was ‘positive allometry’ defined? Was the slope ‘significantly’ greater
11 than 0.33? How was this tested? Using smatr?
12 We have added an introduction to scaling analysis in the materials and methods to aid readers to
13
whom this approach is new, and an explicit description of testing the null hypotheses of isometry

15 and size invariance.

30 They are calculated from force plate and video / cine data of hopping kangaroos, as described on

32
33 Ln 367-378: Really nice points here. Although wouldn’t “load-related suppression of remodelling”
34 actually just result in more microcracking?
35 It might, according to some concepts of microcracking, although microcracks can self-anneal
36
without needing remodelling for repair (e.g. Boyde 2003 doi:10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00213.x).

43 Comments to the Author(s)
44
45
This study has a substantial amount of valuable information but I worry that the paper pushes those
46 data into an area (focus) that is based on some poorly founded assumptions. I do not see why the
47 authors try to use this as a test of functional adaptation in bone, since there are so many unknowns
48 involved in the comparison that is made - size differences, large phylogenetic differences (which
49 may well translate to bone physiological differences), ecological differences, etc. On top of that,
50 even the functional differences between bone loading in hopping and quadrupedal gaits are not
51
well known (and the functional/mechanical basis of any differences are certainly not well
52
53 understood). I know it is expected that a reviewer review the paper that is before them, and not the
54 paper they would prefer, but I cannot help commenting that I think this would be a far superior
55 paper if the speculation about functional adaptation of bone were a small comment in the
56 discussion of a paper comparing and contrasting the skeletal scaling of these two groups.
57
58 Philosophically, I have a very difficult time with scientists who set up a hypothesis, test it, then
59
reject the results because they don’t agree with their pre-conceived world view. This occurs in this

2 paper where the authors obviously expect to see a functional adaptation effect. When it is not seen,
3 they resort to reaching for added effects (basically all of the discussion following line 316).
4 It seems a reasonable hypothesis that due to their use only in the low-speed pentapedal gait, that
5
6
macropods’ forelimb bones should scale weakly compared to hindlimb bones and to artiodactyl
7 forelimb bones, which are loaded in high speed gaits. This would correspond to generally accepted
8 aspects of mammalian bone physiology, in which during development, growth and adulthood (and
9 over evolution), bones adapt to their load environment to maintain loads within a safe range. It
10 would also make sense from an evolutionary standpoint, that those organs that are heavily used
11 become more robust, while those that are not, become vestigial (e.g. pelvic and thoracic limbs of
12
Apterygidae). From a bone physiology standpoint, the loads that are most stimulatory, and which
13
14 can cause substantial modelling in the adult, are high strains and high strain rates of the kind seen
15 during high energy activity such as running and jump landings. So we do “expect to see a functional
16 adaptation effect” based on the prior literature. This is not a ‘pre-conceived world view’ it is the
17 accepted science that we are aware of. We have only ‘rejected the results’ where the statistical tests
18 fail to reject H0. We seek to explain our findings as well as we can based on what is known, and
19 speculate sensibly to guide future investigations. (i.e. that rather than high magnitude and rates of
20
loading from infrequent loads underlying scaling, perhaps very regular, lower magnitude and rates
21
22 of loading are as/more important; in these two clades sampled). Nowhere do we dismiss the data or
23 the numerical analysis – we have a readout and want to know what it means. We welcome
24 alternative suggestions.
25
26 In response to this criticism we have moved the bulk of the description of bone modelling
27 physiology to the discussion to make clear that it is one of several potential explanations for the
28
29
scaling patterns that we observe.

40 Regarding scaling of artiodactyls as baseline (characteristic) clade. I do not agree that they are
41 representative of standard mammalian skeletal proportions and I think this is supported by studies
42 from McMahon, Christensen or Bertram. The authors themselves seem to contradict this later in
43
the paper (line 177 artiodactyls long limbed). This may have an important effect on interpretation
44
45 of differences between the two groups (as in line 254).
46 Artiodactyls might not be a taxonomic baseline but they are much more “representative” in
47 conformation and behaviour than the macropods, by displaying the most typical, quadrupedal, gaits
48 exclusively, compared to the unusual bipedal hopping of the macropods (another famous hopping
49 mammal example is jerboas, but these do not have the same body mass range of macropods and so
50 are unsuitable for a scaling study). Artiodactyls also have the advantage of a relatively broad range
51
52
of body mass from 1-2 kg (mouse-deer) to several tonnes (hippopotamus), with representatives at
53 each order of magnitude. We have changed the wording to remove the implication that artiodactyls
54 represent the ancestral condition of mammals, and to emphasise the reason for using them in this
55 study, which is that they are quadrupedal, and a convenient taxon to sample from.
56
57 Line 87 - it should be acknowledged that this need not be functional adaptation, but selection for
58
structurally sound form: ie, with an adaptation/genetically determined basis.
59
60 Yes, good point, this is another alternative explanation for the lack of difference between fore- and
hind and artiodactyl/macropod – the shape is set earlier (evolution, development, growth), than

2 maintained only by adult activity. We now mention development, growth and evolution in the
3 Introduction and Discussion to provide this important perspective.

Line 154 - the term ‘elevation’ relates to the way the relationship looks on a plot (and it is
7 refreshing that the authors have not made the naive error of referring to it as the ‘intercept’) but
8 from a mathematical standpoint I believe ‘a’ should be considered the scaling coefficient, as ‘b’ is
9 considered the scaling exponent (ie b is not referred to as the scaling slope).
10 Thanks for pointing this out, we have corrected a from ‘elevation’ to ‘coefficient’. The case of ‘b’ is
11 less straightforward. In the original power expression b is the exponent, but after log transformation
12
b is the slope of the linear function that is fitted by the regression calculation, so it is equally valid
13
14 to refer to b as either an exponent or a slope, but incorrect to refer to a as the elevation (or
15 intercept), which is log(a). We explain this in the Methods, L184-190.
16
17 Line 300 - why make this paper about functional adaptation when the interpretation is based on
18 poorly founded assumptions. If anything, this aspect could be an add-on in the discussion.
19 The paper is about which events in the loading history have the dominant effect on skeletal
20
proportions. Skeletal physiology as understood today would lead to the assumption that high (and
21
22 unusual) mechanical loads have the greatest effect on adult bone cross-sectional parameters,
23 compared to the more frequent loads engendered by low-speed activity. It is also curious that
24 evolution has not favoured a diminution of forelimb, and enhancement of hind limb proportions, in
25 large hopping bipeds. Thanks to this reviewer’s points we have revised the manuscript to be more
26 circumspect about mechanisms for the scaling patterns that we measure.
27
28
29
I wonder about relying only on maximum normalized 2nd moment of area to characterize cross-
30 section. This washes out effects of bone orientation. For instance, in the artiodactyls the
31 metacarpal and metatarsal fusion leaves a substantial lateral broadening of the element that may
32 not be meaningful (at least in a simple way) to load resistance in locomotion. That is, this
33 morphology represents substantial phylogenetic history effects (morphological inertia that may
34 actually be functionally ineffective, but may appear as some sort of advantage by the calculation
35
used in this study).
36
37
38 This is a consideration that we have thought about at length. In the first instance, Imax and Imin (and
39 the related measurements, J, Z and CSA) correlate very closely, so there is little explanatory value
40 for this kind of study to report them all; the paper would rapidly become unwieldy with many more
41 plots and the statistics become weaker with repeated measures of essentially the same property. This
42 is mentioned in the Methods section. There is a tradeoff in using Imax alone, which the reviewer has
43
identified, which is that eccentricity is not accounted for in regions like the tibial crest, or the
44
45 artiodactyl metacarpal, where the profile is eccentric. On the other hand, limb segments like the
46 antebrachium and the manus are problematic because the radius and ulna are loaded together, but
47 analysed separately, while the diprotodont Mc3 has its 4 neighbouring metacarpals spreading the
48 load alongside it.
49
50 It is important to recognise that although I has a meaning in the context of beam theory, here we use
51
52
it mainly as a geometric descriptor, that encapsulates an estimate of the size and disposition of bone
53 material in the cross-section. Extrapolating geometrically calculated I to real performance in
54 bending is fraught because the principal axes do not usually correspond to the neutral plane of
55 bending, which we now mention in the Methods.
56
57 Line 356 - I believe I understand the statements intent regarding the term ‘within’, meaning within
58
each clade there appears to be no strong or systematic relationship between bone geometry scaling
59
60 and phylogenetic relationship. However, the paper is about a comparison between Diprotodont and
artiodactyl scaling so a reader may interpret this as a statement meaning there is no phylogenetic
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos

1
2 signal coming from these two disparate clades - something I am skeptical of. Possibly a mention of
3 the result of the phylogenetic effect at that level would be warranted.
4 Our new analyses (using phylogenetic RMA as per comments above) do show some phylogenetic
5
6
signal within clades in some cases, but there is no very strong phylogenetic signal overall; or better
7 said, our fundamental conclusions do not hang on whether a phylogenetically-informed analysis is
8 used or not. That is clear in the current MS. The reviewer’s other point is interesting. Both clades
9 are independently specialized and thus have undergone their own phylogenetic transformations in
10 form and function (e.g. hopping macropods; cursorial artiodactyls with a broad size range). The
11 within-clade scaling patterns are, in a broader context, indicative of this independent specialization.
12
We have done prior studies of felid (cat) species and bird species using similar methods and the
13
14 scaling patterns we find in the current study suggest some broader phylogenetic patterns, such as the
15 general trend for “universal” scaling of stylopodial dimensions (see main text), or trends common to
16 artiodactyls and felids (e.g. mild allometry of some limb bones).
17
18 Figures - I find the traditional scaling plots as in. Fig. 4 quite informative as the relationship
19 between variables is easily evaluated and the strength of relationship (and effect of outliers) can be
20
readily seen. It would have been nice to have a similar plot for some measure of diameter against
21
22 body mass as well, or length against diameter (a directly relevant structural feature). Instead, these
23 data are plotted as independent ‘b’ vs length and ‘a’ vs length, which I find very difficult to
24 interpret. For instance, how is it that the clearly apparent ‘elevation’ difference seen between the
25 metacarpals of the two clades in Fig. 4 is totally obscured in Fig. 7?
26
27 We appreciate that the scaling exponent vs per cent length plots are somewhat unfamiliar. We do
28
29
find them – alongside the normalised Imax versus per cent length plots - very rewarding in terms of
30 revealing relationships that may otherwise be missed if we confined ourselves to calculating
31 exponents and coefficients only at 50% length, because structural adaptation occurs throughout the
32 bone organ and not only in the mid-diaphysis. To aid the reader we have included plots of Imax
33 versus mass and Imax versus length at 50% of length in figure 4. To answer the final point – the
34 elevation difference between metacarpal regressions in figure 4 is not shown in figure 7, because
35
figure 4a-g displays l versus M, while figure 7 plots elevations of Imax versus l and Imax versus M, so
36
37 they are not the same variables to compare.

5 Abstract
6 Bone adaptation is modulated by the timing, direction, rate, and magnitude of mechanical
7 loads. To investigate whether frequent slow, or infrequent fast, gaits could dominate bone
8 adaptation to load, we compared scaling of the limb bones from two mammalian herbivore
9 25 clades that use radically different high-speed gaits, bipedal hopping (suborder
10
Macropodiformes; kangaroos and kin) and quadrupedal galloping (order Artiodactyla; goats,
11
deer and kin). Forelimb and hindlimb bones were collected from 20 artiodactyl and 15
12
13
macropod species (body mass M 1.05 – 1536 kg) and scanned in computed tomography or X-
14 ray microtomography. Second moment of area (Imax) and bone length (l) were measured.
15 30 Scaling relations (y = axb) were calculated for l vs M for each bone and for Imax vs M and Imax
16 vs l for every 5% of length. Imax vs M scaling relationships were broadly similar between
17 clades despite the macropod forelimb being nearly unloaded, and the hindlimb highly loaded,
18 during bipedal hopping. Imax vs l and l vs M scaling were related to locomotor and behavioural
19 specialisations. Low-intensity loads may be sufficient to maintain bone mass across a wide
20 35 range of species. Occasional high-intensity gaits might not break through the load sensitivity
21 saturation engendered by frequent low-intensity gaits.

Introduction
24
During daily rest and activity in development, growth, and adulthood, bones experience a
25
26
40 range of mechanical loading conditions that relate to each behaviour’s physical intensity.
27 Kangaroos, wallabies and their macropodiform kin are famed for their hopping hindlimb gait
28 which they use for bursts of efficient high-speed locomotion [1–3]. They are less well known
29 for their slower pentapedal gait, wherein their powerful tail acts as the third point of a tripod
30 with the forelimbs during hindlimb protraction [4] (Fig. 1). The pentapedal gait is used during
31 45 grazing, and along with other slow-speed activities, dominates macropods’ locomotor
32 behaviour. Tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) spend up to twice as much time per day in
33 pentapedal walking than in bipedal hopping (6% vs 3-5%), and both gaits are eclipsed in the
34 locomotor time budget by bipedal standing (50-70%), quadrupedal crouching (15-30%), and
35 bipedal rearing (3-12%) [3,5,6]. During hopping, the forelimbs are held away from ground
36 50 contact for the entire stride cycle and thus are relatively unloaded [2], while hindlimb tissues
37
experience near-ultimate stresses from ground reaction forces and muscle-tendon action,
38
especially in larger Macropodiformes [7]. The tail’s role in pentapedal locomotion during
39
40 slow-speed locomotion might enable reduced forelimb mass, potentially assisting more
41 efficient bipedal hopping [4]. In extinct sthenurine macropods, the thoracic limb displays
42 55 features of a browsing adaptation with elongated manus, reduced lateral digits, slender radius,
43 ulna and humerus, and a ‘human-like’ scapula, which may have enabled these animals to
44 forage browse above their heads [8]. Hopping is likely not possible at body mass over ~160
45 kg, at which the distal tendons’ safety factor (ratio of actual to ultimate stress) drops below 1,
46 meaning that extinct ‘giant kangaroos’ would have used slower gaits [7–10].
47 60
48 In contrast to macropods, artiodactyl mammals (even-toed ungulates in the eutherian lineage;
49 deer, sheep, camels and kin) have limited manual dexterity, and quadrupedal gaits in which
50
the loads are spread evenly among fore- and hindlimbs during both slow and fast gaits,
51
reflected in similarity of forelimb and hindlimb bones’ cross-sectional properties [11].
52
53
65 Artiodactyls and macropods spend a large proportion of their time grazing or resting as they
54 are foregut fermenter herbivores [12] and may be considered ecological equivalents [13].
55 Extinct giant macropods could not hop due to tissue strength being exceeded by scaling of
56 muscle and tendon stress [9], yet even the largest artiodactyls retain high-speed gaits. Bison,

5 buffalo, and giraffe are capable of galloping [14,15], while hippopotami achieve high land
6 70 speeds by a fast walk or trot [16]. Scaling of limb bones in artiodactyls is relatively well
7 characterised, exhibiting isometric or modestly allometric patterns across their 3-order of
8 magnitude body mass range [17–20].
9
10
The distributions of occasional maximal loads and habitual moderate loads vary within the
11
75 skeleton and depend on locomotor activity, which should appear as a morphological signal in
12
13
clades that adopt very different characteristic gaits [21]. Although direct bone strain gauge
14 data do not exist, positive allometry of hindlimb muscle physiological cross-sectional area,
15 reduced duty factor with increasing speed, and constant effective mechanical advantage of
16 hindlimb joints, likely lead to relatively increased muscle force, and increased stress and
17 80 reduced safety factors in larger macropods’ hind limb bones [10,22,23]. Bennett (2000)
18 pointed out that kangaroos’ tibial cross-sections (section modulus Z and second moment of
19 area I, which relate to fracture strength and resistance to bending respectively) scale more
20 strongly than other quadrupeds [24], whereas McGowan et al. (2008) found that the macropod
21 femur is more robust in larger animals lending support to the concept that intense hopping
22 85 could relate to increased hindlimb robustness [22]. Musculotendinous forces generated during
23 hopping could incur relatively larger loads on tendon insertion sites around the metaphyses
24
compared to artiodactyls. Those larger loads in macropods may manifest as stronger scaling
25
26
of cross-sectional parameters in macropods’ metaphyses, evidenced as higher scaling
27 exponents. Conversely, if the more frequently-used, slower gaits’ loading environment drive
28 90 bone shape then we should expect to see similar scaling between macropods’ fore- and
29 hindlimbs, and between equivalent bones in macropods and artiodactyls, because the low
30 speed pentapedal gait and quadrupedal walking respectively, dominate these clades’
31 locomotor repertoires.
32
33 95 Using artiodactyls as a quadrupedal comparator clade that has a wide body mass range, we
34 ask whether macropod limb bones exhibit structural scaling features that relate to their
35 pentapedal and hopping locomotor specialisations. In particular, we predict that the forelimb
36 bones of the macropods, which are used for grasping and low-speed locomotion (and are
37
essentially unloaded during hopping), should become relatively more gracile with increases in
38
100 body size, and consequently have lower scaling exponents than artiodactyl forelimb and
39
40 macropod hindlimb bones. We hypothesise that scaling exponents should be more similar
41 between fore- and hindlimb bones in artiodactyls than in macropods due to artiodactyls' more
42 even distribution of stresses between fore- and hindlimbs during high-speed locomotion.
43
44 105 Materials & Methods
45 We selected the humerus, radius, ulna, and metacarpal bone (III in macropods and fused III-
46 IV in artiodactyls), along with the femur, tibia and metatarsal bone (IV in macropods and
47 fused III-IV in artiodactyls) from 15 macropod and 20 artiodactyl species (Table 1). All
48 specimens were skeletally mature as determined by fusion of the growth plates, and free from
49 110 obvious skeletal disease. We imaged the bones in clinical computed tomographic (CT)
50
scanners (LightSpeed 16, Ultra, or Pro 16, GE Medical Systems, Pollards Wood, UK) or for
51
the smallest specimens, in an X-ray microtomographic scanner (XMT; X-Tek HMX ST 225,
52
53
Nikon Metrology, Tring, UK) with the bone’s long axis positioned parallel to the image’s z-
54 axis, and applied a similar image processing technique used elsewhere [25,26]. Scans where
55 115 the long axis of the bone was oblique to the z-axis of the scanner were aligned with BoneJ’s
56 Moments plugin, so that the bone's principal axes of inertia were parallel with the scan's x-, y-

5 , and z-axes. Scans with large numbers of image slices were downsampled without
6 interpolation to contain 100-200 slices, providing 5-10 values for averaging in each 5% length
7 bin. Fat in the marrow cavity and other bony or metal elements were manually replaced with a
8 120 pixel value corresponding to air. Where nearby or fused bones could not be excluded by a
9 rectangular region of interest (ROI), they were manually removed by replacing them with
10
pixels of an air-equivalent value. Bones containing lesions or severe post-mortem
11
deterioration were excluded from the study. Image analysis was performed with BoneJ v1.4.2
12
13
[27,28] for ImageJ v1.51c [29].
14 125
15 Maximum second moment of area (Imax) was measured on every slice of each scanned
16 specimen with Slice Geometry in BoneJ. Other parameters including Imin, cross-sectional area
17 and section modulus were also measured and are available in the associated datasets [30], but
18 are not reported here due to their close mathematical relationships: I is calculated by
19 130 multiplying area by distance from the principal axis squared, and section modulus is
20 calculated by dividing I by chord length. Imax can reflect the stiffness of a member in bending,
21 although we use Imax here as a geometric parameter of cross-sectional size and disposition that
22 includes non-bending related features such as the tibial crest, which loaded mainly in tension
23 by the patellar ligament. To calculate bending stiffness I is calculated around the neutral plane
24
135 of bending, which moves during the stride cycle, and which usually does not coincide with the
25
26
principal axis used to calculate Imax [31]. Because the ratios between specimen size, image
27 resolution, and pixel spacing were not constant, we applied a correction for partial filling of
28 pixels which maintains comparable cross-sectional area measurements when image
29 resolution, pixel spacing and resolution vary with respect to each other (Figure 2). Partial
30 140 filling correction was set by excluding pixels less than -800 HU to eliminate artefacts with
31 values close to air (-1000 HU) and scaling linearly between -1000 HU (0% bone, 100% air) to
32 2300 HU (100% bone). Pixel values over 2300 HU were considered 100% bone. XMT
33 images lacking HU calibration were set by taking a histogram of an ROI positioned in the
34 background and using its mean for the 100% air scaling value and its maximum as the
35 145 minimum cutoff value. Another histogram was made in a thick region of cortical bone and its
36 mean used as the 100% bone scaling value. The partial volume correction approach was
37
validated using synthetic images and an exemplar CT image, and resulted in a high degree of
38
stability compared to global thresholding; test scripts and data are available online [30]. Bone
39
40 length (l) was measured using the image data, which we validated against physical
41 150 measurement of the bones. Body mass (M) was unknown for most of the specimens so was
42 estimated from literature values [32–35]. The red and Eastern grey kangaroo specimens were
43 male, so we used body masses near the high end of the estimate to account for the sexual
44 dimorphism in these species.
45
46 155 We analysed scaling of bone dimensions using the general equation y = axb [36], where y is
47 the bone parameter, x is a measure of size (body mass M or bone length l), a is the scaling
48 coefficient and b is the scaling exponent. The exponent b expresses the rate of change in y as a
49 function of body size, while a is the magnitude of y when x = 1. Scaling analysis relies on
50
linear fitting to the log transformed variables, log(y) = log(a) + blog(x), where b becomes the
51
160 slope of the line and log(a) the y intercept or ‘elevation’. The purpose of a scaling analysis is
52
53
to determine whether relative proportions of the variables under study (here, l, Imax, and M)
54 vary with size. Isometry occurs when the larger animal is a ‘to-scale’ version of the smaller
55 animal and the dimensions retain the same proportions, with an isometric scaling exponent bi.
56 Deviations from isometry occur when b is greater or less than bi, and the corresponding

5 165 variation in proportions with size is termed allometry. Positive allometry occurs when there is
6 a disproportionately greater increase in y with increasing x and b > bi , while negative
7 allometry occurs when there is a disproportionately lesser increase in y with increasing x, and
8 b < bi. Differences in scaling coefficient between groups may be calculated when exponents
9 are equal, and represent a fixed ratio with changing size. Scaling estimates were calculated
10
170 using smatr version 3.4-3 [37] for R [38], using the standardised major axis (SMA, also
11
known as RMA), which accounts for error in x as well as in y, and is suited to scaling
12
13
analyses, which typically deal with data that have a large amount of unidentifiable error or
14 “natural variation” [39]. Exclusion of the exponent values for isometry (l~M, bi = 1/3; Imax~M,
15 bi = 4/3; Imax~l, bi = 4) by 95% confidence intervals returned by smatr was used to test the null
16 175 hypothesis of isometry, and R2 and p from an F-test was used to test the null hypothesis of
17 scale invariance, in which there is no correlation between variables. Cross-sectional
18 parameters were averaged within each 5% increment of length and scaling exponents and
19 elevations calculated for each 5% bin across all the individuals in each clade, for each bone in
20 the study. Normalized cross-sectional parameters were calculated by dividing the nth root of
21 180 the parameter by length. Second moment of area has units of mm4, so it was normalized by
22 taking the 4th root and dividing by bone length in mm. Normalized parameters are unitless and
23 a size-independent measure of shape.
24
25
26
To control for non-independence of samples due to their phylogeny, a phylogenetically-
27 185 informed version of RMA (phyl.RMA) from the R package phytools [40] was called from a
28 custom script to calculate scaling relationships versus M for bone length and Imax at mid-shaft
29 (50% of bone length). Calibrated phylogenetic trees, one for macropods and one for
30 artiodactyls, were used for this analysis and were constructed based on divergence time
31 estimates from a previous publication [41]; values from the two Eastern grey kangaroo
32 190 specimens were averaged for the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3). We report the results of the
33 phylogenetic RMA with five parameters: the estimate of the scaling exponent (b); the squared
34 correlation coefficient (R2); the p-value for devation from isometry comparing exponents
35 using an F-test (p); Pagel’s <U+03BB>, a measure of how well the phylogeny explains the data (<U+03BB>=1
36 suggests the evolution of the observed traits follows a Brownian motion model with variance
37
195 proportional to divergence times, whereas <U+03BB>=0 suggests phylogenetic independence); and the
38
log-likelihood (L) [42] in Table 3. We considered also using phylogenetic generalized least
39
40 squares (PGLS) analysis, but as prior studies have found negligible differences between
41 phylogenetic RMA and PGLS results or conclusions [43,44], we opted to apply only
42 phylogenetic RMA to our data, thereby retaining a closer methodological equivalence to our
43 200 standard scaling analysis.

45 Results
46 Bone length versus body mass, and 50 per cent length Imax versus l and M, comparisons are
47 presented in Table 2 and Figure 4. Imax, l, and M are strongly correlated in all bones with high
48 205 R2 (0.737-0.995) and p < 0.001, excluding the null hypothesis of no scaling relationship
49 between the variables. Humerus, radius and ulna lengths scale with positive allometry (b >
50
1/3) in macropods, but with isometry (b not significantly different from 1/3) in artiodactyls.
51
Artiodactyl metacarpal bones are much longer than in macropods of similar mass, indicated
52
53
by the high elevation (1.47 vs. 0.86). In the hindlimb, femur and metatarsal lengths scale
54 210 similarly in macropods and artiodactyls, with the macropod femur having a higher elevation
55 than artiodactyls and the metatarsals’ slopes and elevations not significantly different. Tibia
56 length scales isometrically in artiodactyls and with strong positive allometry in macropods.

5 Comparing stylopod (humerus, femur), zeugopod (radius, ulna, tibia), and autopod
6 (metacarpal, metatarsal) elements between limbs within each of the two clades, there is a high
7 215 degree of overlap between the confidence limits of scaling exponents in all the limb segments,
8 meaning that bone length proportionality between fore- and hindlimb segments is maintained
9 within clades. Mid-diaphyseal Imax scales against M with similar exponents between clades
10
but with differing elevations in all bones except the humerus, indicating constant
11
proportionality between clades with increasing animal size. Mid-diaphyseal Imax scales against
12
13
220 l with different exponents between clades in the humerus, radius, ulna and tibia, and with
14 different elevations in the metacarpal and metatarsal. Notably, the femora are
15 indistinguishable at 50 per cent length in their Imax ~ l scaling.
16
17 Normalized Imax versus per cent length plots (Figure 5) reveal that artiodactyls’ cross-sections
18 225 become relatively more robust with increasing body mass, indicated by the larger animals’
19 traces tending towards the top of the range. Meanwhile, macropods show the opposite trend,
20 with normalized Imax decreasing with increasing body mass so that traces from the larger
21 animals appear at the bottom of the range, indicating increased gracility with increasing body
22 mass. In general, and in common with prior studies on cats and birds [25,26], the artiodactyl
23 230 diaphysis occupies a decreasing proportion (and metaphyses and epiphyses increasing
24
proportions) of bone length with increasing body mass, but this relationship is not maintained
25
26
consistently in macropods. Notably, the trochlear notch and coronoid processes of the ulna
27 drift distally in larger artiodactyls, but proximally in larger macropods (Figure 5e, f).
28
29 235 Scaling exponents (Figure 6) and elevations (Figure 7) for Imax versus M reveal near-identical
30 scaling exponents between clades for all regions of all the bones, and overlapping elevations
31 for all bones in all regions except for the proximal tibial and femoral metaphyses, indicating
32 very similar bone cross-sectional scaling against body mass. Positive allometry (exponent
33 above the isometry line) is strongest in the proximal metaphyses, possibly relating to their
34 240 increasing relative length mentioned above, and this is amplified by increased elevations (i.e.
35 larger value of Imax at a given M) in these regions in macropods (Fig 7f, l, n). Imax versus l
36 scaling reveals positive allometry for much of the length of artiodactyl bones. The wide
37
confidence interval of artiodactyl ulna (Figure 6e) likely reflects the variability of fusion to
38
the radius, reducing the strength of the body size signal. In contrast, macropod Imax scales with
39
40 245 negative allometry against l for much of the length of humerus, radius, ulna and tibia, with
41 positive allometry in the femur and isometry in the metacarpal and metatarsal. The raised
42 elevation of macropods relative to artiodactyls in the Imax versus l plots (Figure 7) is difficult
43 to interpret because the scaling exponents are markedly different between clades in the
44 regions where elevations are different. Despite their orders of magnitude difference the
45 250 elevations may not relate to functional differences, which may be more strongly indicated by
46 differing scaling exponents.
47
48 Despite there being a highly variable amount of phylogenetic signal (Pagel’s <U+03BB> ranged
49 between 0.407 and 0.818 for macropod bones, while it covered the entire range of 0-1 for
50
255 artiodactyl bones), scaling exponents for both artiodactyl and macropod bone length and mid-
51
shaft Imax corrected for phylogenetic effects using phylogenetically-informed RMA remained
52
53
comfortably within the 95% confidence limits of the scaling exponents calculated without
54 phylogenetic adjustment (Tables 2 and 3). Correlations calculated using phylogenetic RMA
55 were similarly strong as their non-corrected counterparts (unadjusted R2 = 0.800-0.979,
56 260 adjusted R2 = 0.640-0.956).

6 In our phylogenetically-informed RMA, macropod femur and third metacarpal lengths scale
7 isometrically, while all other macropod bone lengths scale with positive allometry. Macropod
8 mid-shaft Imax does not scale differently from isometry in all bones except the metatarsal (p:
9 265 humerus 0.164; radius 0.279; ulna 0.156; metacarpal 0.685; femur 0.199; tibia 0.243;
10
metatarsal 0.038).
11
12
13
Phylogenetically-informed RMA suggests that artiodactyl bone lengths scale isometrically
14 except for the metacarpal (slope not different from 1/3, p: humerus 0.468; radius 0.108; ulna
15 270 0.27; metacarpal 0.04; femur 0.455; tibia 0.917; metatarsal 0.158). Artiodactyl mid-shaft Imax
16 scales with positive allometry in the humerus, ulna, metatarsal and metacarpal (p<0.005), with
17 a similar tendency in the radius (p=0.017), but not the femur or tibia (p: femur 0.424; tibia
18 0.078).
19
20 275 In summary, scaling exponents calculated using phylogenetic adjustments for bone length,
21 mid-shaft CSA and mid-shaft Imax concur with the results from the unadjusted scaling
22 relationships. Thus phylogeny has varying explanatory value for bone geometry scaling (as
23 quantified by Pagel’s <U+03BB>) within the two clades of mammals studied here, but does not
24
influence the interpretation of the scaling exponents, as the estimates are essentially no
25
26
280 different between phylogenetically informed and non-phylogenetic scaling analyses.
27
28 Discussion
29 Scaling of the forelimb and hind limb segments is similar within clades, except the stylopod,
30 in which the Imax versus length scaling displays positive allometry in the artiodactyl and
31 285 macropod femur and artiodactyl humerus, but negative allometry in the macropod humerus,
32 meaning that in macropods the humerus becomes more gracile with increasing length while
33 the femur becomes more robust. Unlike Bennett (2000), who found that tibial second moment
34 of area scales more strongly positively in kangaroos than quadrupeds (b = 1.52 vs 1.28) [24],
35 our data show that tibial cross-sections scale similarly against body mass between clades. This
36 290 may be a consequence of comparing macropods to artiodactyls only, and not to a more diverse
37
sample of quadrupeds, because it is known that artiodactyls’ bones scale differently to other
38
mammalian clades [19,20]. Tibial cross-sections scale strongly negatively allometrically in
39
40 macropods and positively allometrically in artiodactyls against length. This means larger
41 kangaroos’ tibiae are relatively less robust – they are relatively longer and more slender
42 295 consistent with a relatively reduced ability to resist bending moments. This apparent reduction
43 in relative bending strength is surprising considering that bending stresses predominate over
44 compressive stresses due to the off-axis component of the muscular forces, with a stress range
45 of -110 to -60 MPa and 90-110MPa [1].
46
47 300 The Imax versus body mass scaling elevation is higher in the macropod proximal femur and
48 tibia than the same region in the artiodactyl femur and tibia, indicating increased robustness
49 around the greater and lesser trochanters and tibial crest, which are the bony insertions for the
50
massive gluteal, iliopsoas, and quadriceps muscle groups that drive bipedal hopping in
51
macropods. Positive allometry of tarsal joint moment arms potentially ameliorates the
52
53
305 musculotendinous compressive force on the tibia during tarsus extension [22], allowing the
54 distal half of macropods’ tibial cross-sections to remain within similar parameters as
55 artiodactyls’. Like McGowan et al. (2008) demonstrated in macropods, we find that the femur
56 is more robust in larger macropods [22], which is consistent with a proposal of a strong,

4
5 general relationship between stylopod cross-sectional parameters and body mass [21]. We find
6 310 that humeral and femoral lengths scale significantly differently against body mass between
7 macropods and artiodactyls, in contrast to suggestions of common mammalian femur length
8 to body mass scaling [45], which may have implications for midshaft bending stresses.
9
10
The largest extant artiodactyls are an order of magnitude more massive than the largest extant
11
315 macropods while the smallest of both clades included in this study are ~1-2 kg. It would be
12
13
unwise to extrapolate macropod scaling trends beyond the current series, because bipedal
14 hopping was likely not a feature of the extinct giant kangaroos and may not be physiologically
15 possible beyond ~160 kg [7–10]. Janis et al. (2014) suggested that large, extant kangaroos are
16 functionally specialised for hopping in contrast to their larger extinct kin that did not hop,
17 320 somewhat similar to the medium-sized, gracile and hyper-athletic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus,
18 M = 35-70 kg) compared to bigger and more robust felids such as lion (Panthera leo, M =
19 120-250 kg) [9].
20
21 We found that the trochlear notch of the ulna is relatively more distal in larger artiodactyls,
22 325 but that an opposite trend of a relatively shortened olecranon process and proximally drifting
23 trochlear notch is observed with increasing mass in macropods. We first noticed a trend to a
24
more centrally-placed trochlear notch in the ulna of large felids [25], and proposed that this
25
26
may be a mechanism that may allow reduced muscle forces by increasing the lever arm of the
27 olecranon process and increasing the elbow extensor muscles’ effective mechanical
28 330 advantage. The relatively shortening olecranon in larger macropods may relate to forelimb use
29 in the low-intensity pentapedal gait and lack of loading in high-intensity bipedal hopping, or
30 to reaching and combat behaviours favouring a longer forelimb. Inter-clade differences in
31 metacarpal dimensions relate to their functional specialisations for grasping, or plantigrade or
32 unguligrade locomotion in macropods and artiodactyls respectively. Similar isometric Imax
33 335 scaling exponents against length indicate maintenance of overall bone shape that may relate to
34 specialised manus function, whereas positive allometry against body mass in artiodactyls but
35 isometry in macropods may reflect an influence of locomotor loading on artiodactyl
36 metacarpal robustness that is absent or reduced in macropods.
37
38
340 Bones respond anabolically, that is, by increasing bone tissue formation and decreasing bone
39
40 resorption, when they experience a small number of novel high strain and high strain rate
41 events with a rest period between bouts of loading [46,47]. Repetitive loading has a saturation
42 or habituation effect, in which tissue is no longer responsive to mechanical loads after a few
43 tens of cycles [47]. The lack of a difference in femoral and tibial Imax versus body mass
44 345 scaling exponents between bipedal hopping macropods and quadrupedal artiodactyls suggests
45 that the occasional very high load of hopping may not be sufficient to overcome the
46 mechanobiological saturation engendered by frequent but lower intensity loading in crouching
47 and pentapedal walking. Alternatively, bipedal hopping may be a no more intense stimulus to
48 the hindlimb than quadrupedal galloping, leading to little discernible difference between
49 350 clades. Galloping and hopping engender similar muscle stresses at preferred speeds in rats and
50
kangaroo rats respectively despite a fourfold difference in ground reaction force [67]. We
51
found similar Imax ~ M scaling exponents in the forelimb bones, despite macropods’ relatively
52
53
unloaded forelimbs during bipedal hopping.
54
55 355 Limb bone adaptation occurs throughout the life of the individual due to bone’s phenotypic
56 plasticity, and at the population level over evolution due to selection pressure relating to

4
5 skeletal development and functional specialisation. Variable safety factors among species and
6 bones [48–50] suggest that peak strains from uncommon or high energy gaits are not
7 necessarily the dominant stimuli for bones’ phenotypic adaptation, or a critical selection
8 360 pressure in evolution. Bone is sensitive to its mechanical environment during growth: altered
9 muscle and gait forces on growing bones relate to bone deformities in children with cerebral
10
palsy and in experimentally manipulated chick and crocodile embryos [51,52], while 12 hours
11
per week of throwing practice leads to substantial cortical bone adaptation in children’s
12
13
throwing arms [53]. In-vivo bone adaptation experiments have shown that the mouse tibia
14 365 receives < 300 µe (microstrain) during walking and < 600 µe when landing a 30cm jump (~
15 3N physiological load), yet requires at least 1000 µe from a 10N experimental load to
16 stimulate further bone formation [54–56]. Only high intensity race training, well beyond the
17 animals’ ad libitum locomotor behaviour, was sufficient to engender an increase in cortical
18 area in horses [57]. Sciatic neurectomy removes daily habitual loading in the mouse hindlimb,
19 370 sensitising the tibia to subsequent load-induced (2000 µe) bone deposition [58], suggesting
20 that the removal of background stimulus can rescue bone’s load responsiveness [59], or in
21 other words, that daily stimulus might saturate bone’s ability to respond to further applied
22 loads. Simple body mass support and the ground reaction forces incurred by a slow gait may
23 be sufficient to maintain cross-sectional bone geometry, while infrequent high intensity
24
375 quadrupedal gaits might offer little further selection pressure or modelling stimulus to
25
26
increase diaphyseal size over and above that provided by standing and walking.
27
28 There are few data on the daily numbers of stride cycles in each gait for the species in the
29 study, which limits our ability to calculate bone loading histories and infer which gaits relate
30 380 most strongly to bone structural scaling, however, in those species that have been studied low
31 intensity behaviours predominate. In large macropods, the most frequent behaviour is lying
32 down or standing still, followed by slow locomotion and only very occasional hopping [3,5].
33 Basic data on macropod locomotor activity exist in addition to that of the tammar wallaby
34 already mentioned [6]. Locomotion comprises only 5-10% of the behavioural repertoire of the
35 385 parma wallaby (Macropus parma) [60]. The larger red and grey kangaroos (Macropus rufus
36 and M. giganteus) spend the day alternating between lying, standing, crouching, grazing, and
37
licking [5]. Agile wallabies’ (Macropus agilis) most common behaviour is foraging (73%),
38
followed by ‘vigilance’ (23%), and locomotion (0-6%) [61]. In grey kangaroos, over 90% of
39
40 daily activity is crouching and lying, with only 0.0-3.3% accounted for by ‘moving’ [62].
41 390 Artiodactyls are similarly slow most of the time: wildebeest (Connochaetes spp.) travel only
42 2-3km daily [63]; red deer (Cervus elaphus) move on average 100-400m per hour [64], while
43 giraffe may walk for 5h daily [65] and can canter for only a few minutes at a time [66].
44
45 A scaling trend in gait preference might exist, such that small animals hop, trot or gallop more
46 395 frequently than large animals, which could influence the interpretation of our results.
47 Macropod species that live in open country generally have a shorter period of suspension than
48 those that live in dense forests or rocky hills, with a potential phylogenetic contribution to
49 duty factor [2] and thus peak ground reaction forces and bone strains. Our phylogenetically-
50
corrected scaling analysis found only limited effects of phylogeny on skeletal scaling
51
400 parameters, suggesting little relationship between behavioural ecology, locomotor style, and
52
53
bone geometry scaling within macropod and artiodactyl clades. Comprehensive behavioural
54 ecology, activity pattern, kinematic, ground reaction force, and tissue strain data would help to
55 place the skeletal scaling that we have identified into the context of functional loading.

5 405 as wombats (Vombatidae), koala (Phascolarctos), and possums (Phalangeridae) in the context
6 of hopping macropods’ skeletal scaling, may help to further separate phylogenetic from
7 mechanobiological effects. Kinematic data exist for sheep, goats [68,69], pigs [70], cattle and
8 a small number of other artiodactyls during walking [71] and for a small number of
9 macropods [72–74], but bone strain data are missing in all but a few species [69,75].
10
410
11
The lack of differential cross-sectional scaling in the macropod hindlimb despite their
12
13
hopping behaviour led us to the speculation that their bones might have enhanced fatigue
14 damage repair by increased remodelling, thus reducing the need for extra bone mass. We
15 failed to find secondary osteonal remodelling in a Macropus giganteus femur sample, which
16 415 was somewhat unusual for an animal of 33kg body mass [76]. Absence of secondary osteons
17 may relate to the single sample failing to include any by chance, a load-related suppression of
18 remodelling protecting bone from local weakening due to osteoclastic resorption [57], or
19 infilling of existing osteons as occurs in horses after moderate-intensity training [77]. The
20 current and other studies of bone organ allometry assume no size-related variation in bone
21 420 microstructure or physiology and that all mammalian bone has similar biomechanical and
22 mechanobiological behavior. Our recent work demonstrated that secondary osteons are wider
23 in larger animals and narrower in smaller animals [76], and that trabeculae are thicker and
24
more widely spaced in larger animals [78] indicating that biophysical constraints or cellular
25
26
behaviour may vary among mammals and potentially interact with whole-bone-level scaling.
27 425 Integration of macro- and micro-level perspectives in future scaling studies could be
28 particularly informative.
29
30 Forelimb-hindlimb and bipedal-quadrupedal comparisons of scaling relationships have
31 revealed very similar cross-sectional scaling against mass in the primary weightbearing limb
32 430 bones in artiodactyls and macropods, despite differences in their high intensity gaits,
33 suggesting that habitual low loads rather than occasional high loads may be the dominant
34 stimuli for bone modelling (i.e. scaling) in individuals and across evolution. Cross-sectional
35 scaling against length meanwhile appears to relate to clade-related specialisations such as
36 macropods’ long, gracile forelimb used in low-speed weightbearing and grasping food, and
37
435 artiodactyls’ more robust forelimb bones specialised for cursorial locomotion.

42 traces indicates bone shape differences among species. Higher traces indicate relatively more
43 robust bone geometry, seen in larger artiodactyls and smaller macropods. Note the increasing
44 510 proportion of length occupied by epiphyseal and metaphyseal components in larger
45 artiodactyl species (a, i), and the distal drift of the ulna’s trochlear notch (dashed line) in
46 larger artiodactyls (e) and smaller macropods ( f).

Appendix C
Authors’ response to reviews on RSOS-180152.R1, “Limb bone scaling in hopping
macropods and quadrupedal artiodactyls”
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_19
I reviewed a previous version of this manuscript. I believe the authors have made
considerable amendments to the draft in response to the reviewers, and the
manuscript is much improved for this.
A few minor things occured to me on re-reading, but it's at the authors discretion if
they want to act on them:
- I'm still unclear as to why they have chosen to test for the presence of
positive/negative allometry as being the fact that the slope CI's exclude the value for
isometry. This is fine, but you can't put a confidence level on this statement. Smatr
has the 'slope.test' function, which is there explicitly to test if slopes are significantly
different from a given value, and include p-values for the test
The particular representation we show in Figs 6 and 7 helps the reader to see where
and by how much scaling exponents and elevations differ (or not) between clades,
locations and from isometry, in one view. If there is ‘fresh air’ between the grey CI
bands, we can be confident of a real difference; if CIs overlap, our confidence of a
difference diminishes in proportion to the degree of overlap. We do provide p values
at 50% of length in Table 2 which readers could use to calibrate their interpretation
of overlapping CIs. An evolution of the Fig 6&7 style would be to shade the CI
bands, to show a likelihood density of the true values. The bands could then spread
out to 99% and higher CIs. One approach to these kinds of comparisons is to use a
‘heat map’ of p values (e.g. Javaheri et al. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-25084-6), but
we have chosen not to do that to reduce visual clutter in the plots, which are already
information dense.
- It strikes me as quite odd that the lambda value for Imax in the femur of
artiodactyls in 0. Given that the neighbouring tibia and metatarsals have quite
strong phylogenetic signal, do you have any idea why this might be the case?
Pagel’s <U+03BB> is an estimate of phylogenetic signal, and a value of 0 implies that close
relatives are not more similar than distant relatives. Our data (esp. Figs 4s, 6j, 7j)
show that the femur’s cross-sectional scaling is remarkably conserved, being
indistinguishable between artiodactyls and macropods, despite their phylogenetic
separation and different gaits. So, it is not surprising to us that there is little
phylogenetic signal in femoral Imax within the artiodactyl clade. It seems that the
digits and zeugopod (radius, ulna, tibia) are the dominant sites of evolutionary
plasticity in limb bones, and this is borne out by their higher Pagel’s <U+03BB> values. We
have paraphrased this explanation around L342.
- It occurs to me that your findings have quite important implications for
palaeontologists wishing to reconstruct locomotor performance on the basis of limb
scaling. If we can't differentiate between bipedal hopping and quadrupedal
galloping in a large modern dataset, what hope to we have of identifying potential
bipedalism in ornithiscian dinosaurs for example? Or the transition to bipedalism
through hominid evolution? Obviously there are other techniques to get at these
questions, but your results imply that limb bone scaling might not be the way?
That’s a very helpful insight. We started this project with the view that activity levels
relate strongly to bone cross-sectional parameters, which is used in physical
anthropology to infer human behaviours. But that is dealing with only one species
typically (relatively modern humans), with similar background locomotor patterns
and the interesting differences come about due to hunting or farming activities, for
example. Here the importance to us is that perhaps regular low-level loading is
enough to maintain bone cross-sectional parameters and that occasional high-
intensity gait superimposed on common low-level loading has a relatively weak
signal in a scaling context. That means perhaps animals transitioning from
quadrupedal to bipedal gaits (e.g. facultatively bipedal) might not be detected using
this kind of approach. As you point out, the transition to bipedalism in hominids and
ornithischian dinosaurs can be investigated in a number of other ways, such as
muscle attachment sites and joint conformation, which we don’t consider here.
We accordingly added two final sentences to the Discussion: “Our conclusions that
high-speed bipedal hopping and quadrupedal galloping do not seem to leave a strong
signal in limb bone geometry are some cause for caution in the interpretation of
extreme behaviours in other, especially extinct, taxa from bone scaling. However,
identification of locomotor patterns such as bipedalism/quadrupedalism is best done
via multiple lines of evidence, which could still include bone scaling analysis (e.g.
79,80).”

The authors have satisfied all my comments. I think this study will be a great
addition to RSOS, and I look forward to seeing where this research goes in the
future. I have a few very minor comments on things that should be reworded, and
they can be found in the attached PDF. (Comments reproduced here for editors’
convenience - MD)
L63 Do you mean 'more evenly'? Given that forelimbs support 60% body mass, it
could be that they experience a higher load. Then again if I recall correctly the
hindlimbs provide a greater net thrust during steady state locomotion... Maybe just
double check this?
Amended to ‘more evenly’.
L71 Are you sure this should be ‘three orders’?
Adult artiodactyl body masses span single units of kg up to thousands (but not tens
of thousands) of kg. So this is the correct number of orders of magnitude. Perhaps
the reviewer is suggesting a formatting change? Amended to ‘three orders’.
L74 I see what you are saying, and I don't think it's wrong, but I would offer one
caveat: an additional factor would be differences in the movement ecology and
activity patterns among particular species.
We agree, and raise this in the discussion in two paragraphs around L380-415,
relating to movement ecology and activity patterns. There is as yet insufficient data
to test these important hypotheses – we cite what we could find on these points.
L215 I would cite Table 2 here
Cited table 2.
L292 Having three adverbs back to back reads weird. Maybe try '...scale with a
strong(ly) negative allometry…'
We agree, thank you, amended.
L387 Do you mean stationary foraging vs locomotion? Or do you mean foraging
with intermittent locomotion vs. continuous locomotion?
Blumstein et al. don’t specify, although they do have a separate ‘locomotion’
category, which implies stationary foraging. We leave that interpretation up to the
reader of our paper and theirs.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_21
This is an interesting and informative study that adds important insight into our
understanding of bone scaling. It is well written and enjoyable to read. I have only a
couple of minor points that I feel should be addressed.
The authors note and consistently refer to the slow gait of macropods and
pentapedal. While this is true for large macropods, it becomes less so for smaller
species. I expect that the smaller species in your sample do not use the tail much at
all in slow locomotion. Therefore, the authors should consider how load distribution
between forelimbs and tail may also scale in this group.
We agree that gait scaling could be a significant confounder in this study and discuss
potential gait scaling in macropods in the paragraph around L395. To address the
reviewer’s point, we have added the subclause, ‘… or display different relative
loading among forelimbs, hindlimbs and tail … ’.
On line 67, the authors state definitively that extinct giant kangaroos could not hop.
While I believe this is likely the case, I don't believe the data exist to make this
unqualified statement.
Added the qualifier ‘likely’ here and ‘may not have hopped’ on L324.
