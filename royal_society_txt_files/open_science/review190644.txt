Comments to the Author:
The presented manuscript is an introduction into a special issue on the broad topic of inclusive
fitness and the evolution of cooperation. The introduction starts with a historic overview over a
recent debate over the inclusive fitness theory, which is very readable and gives an accessible and
interesting introduction why a special issue in this area is highly relevant.
After this, the introduction give a bit of background over the origin of this special issue and gives
a bit more background information why the debate is generally relevant in the field of
evolutionary biology. Further, the author discusses the interdisciplinary relevance of the topic.
Overall the introduction is readable and gives a very nice overview over the topic.
