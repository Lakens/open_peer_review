This research is the first to combine ancient DNA and radiocarbon dating to investigate the
introduction of chickens in New Zealand, an important question that yet remains unknown. The
study selected 3 of the earliest chicken bones found in New Zealand, with radiocarbon dates
falling in the 18th century or later, while their genetic signatures belonged to the globally-
distributed haplogroup E. The authors conclude that chickens were most likely introduced in
New Zealand by the Europeans during James Cook’s second voyage and finish by discussing the
impact of the introduction of chickens on native societies.
This research answers an important question and does so by combining archaeological evidence
with dating techniques, ancient DNA and historical records. The methods used are appropriate
and replicable and the discussion is thorough. In particular, the discussion of the impact of the
arrival of chickens among the Maori tribes is a topic often missed in studies investigating the
introduction of livestock in new areas. I was very pleased to see it discussed here.
I only have a list of minor corrections:
1) Although detailed in the discussion, it would be useful to have a sentence or two in the
introduction mentioning the date of the first European contact, the date of the first permanent
European settlement and whether or not European inter-island voyages were occurring between
these two dates.
2) The authors mention that this is the first study which undertakes both radiocarbon
dating and ancient DNA on chicken bones in New Zealand, yet the genetic results are not
discussed once in the discussion. There needs to be at least one paragraph providing some
genetic background (worldwide dominance of haplogroup E and Polynesian chicken genetic
signature belonging to haplogroup D) and some discussion regarding the genetic results of the
two chicken bones currently under study.
3) The authors mention that both of their bones belong to haplogroup E but that one of
them is a novel haplotype. However, more than 67 mitochondrial DNA haplotypes exist
(Supplementary Table 1) and I would like to know if the authors have used BLAST to ensure
their haplotype is novel. If so, please mention this in the 5.3 Ancient DNA section. If not, please
conduct a BLAST search to ensure your haplotype is novel and include the results in the 5.3
Ancient DNA section.
4) Please provide fragment length of the amplified DNA sequence and the gene you looked
at (control region of the mitochondrial DNA) under ‘2.2 Ancient DNA’
5) The sequences need to be submitted to Genbank and the Genbank Accession Number to
be included in the paper (in particular due to the novel haplotype).

Review by Prof Lisa Matisoo-Smith,
Dept of Anatomy, University of Otago
The manuscript, “Origin and timing of New Zealand’s earliest domestic chickens: Polynesian
commensals or European introductions?” by Wood et al., presents an interesting study – testing
the often argued assumption that chickens were not introduced to New Zealand by Maori
colonists prior to European arrival in the Pacific. The paper describe radiocarbon dates for three
archaeological chicken bones recovered from sites in New Zealand that contain evidence of early
Maori occupation and DNA data for two of these bones. The authors argue that based on the
three radiocarbon dates, of which the median age of two falls at ~1760, a period which pre-dates
permanent European settlement (1830s), these were likely chickens that were descendants of
those introduced by Capt. James Cook or Tobias Furneaux in 1773.
Unfortunately the interpretation of their results is flawed. The authors state that “we provide the
first radiocarbon and aDNA analyses of chicken bones from prehistoric Maori middens.” This
statement is misleading. The chicken bones used in the analysis came from collections held in the
Canterbury Museum, which were “collected some decades prior to this study, and there were not
exact details on stratigraphic contexts available...”. They then cite one reference, Jacomb 2009, for
the fact that one of the sites (Redcliffs School Site) is “considered to exclusively represent the
earliest phase of human settlement in New Zealand”. They neglect to point out that Jacomb
2009:21 also states that “subsequent earth disturbance from residential activities resulted in the
introduction of modern material into the site including sheep and chicken bones as well as glass,
bricks and nails.” Jacomb goes on further to point out that the chicken bones were only found in
the modern, disturbed layers (Jacomb 2009:22). No references are given for the other two sites,
Mussel Point and Fyffe’s Site, so it is difficult to assess the context. In particular, there is no
evidence presented or reference cited that “...the chicken bones were found in association with
bones of large bird species that went extinct in the first 200 years after initial settlement...”. In fact,
4
if they were found in association with Moa bones, this would be clear evidence of significant
disturbance. Archaeologists are very clear about the problems of interpreting single radiocarbon
dates from archaeological sites, as individual sample and site context is particularly important
and part of the growing trend in “chronometric hygiene”. Interpreting events with accuracy to a
period of less than 100 years based on single dates from two sites, with no archaeological context
is highly problematic. Regardless, the results are interesting as these bones may indeed date to an
early European occupation period.
The authors go on to describe the sequencing of a short (200bp) segment of the mitochondrial
control region in two of the samples. The sequences were determined to belong to chicken
mtDNA haplogroup E as defined by previous researchers. Though they do not discuss the
implication of these DNA sequences in the text of the paper itself, they do mention in the abstract
that “The chickens belong to the mitochondrial control region haplogroup E, indicating that they
were derived from source populations outside of the Pacific.” Again, this interpretation is
misleading. Haplogroup E chickens have been described from well stratified and well dated pre-
European Pacific Island contexts (in Vanuatu, Samoa and, indeed, Tonga) (Storey et al. 2012;
Storey et al. 2010). The authors make the assumption that any Haplogroup E sequences found in
Pacific chickens are the result of contamination by modern European chicken DNA which they
claim is a “common contaminant of some PCR reagents” and they cite Leonard et al 2007 for this
evidence. The actual data (Leonard et al. 2007:1363) shows that only one case of chicken DNA
contamination was found in an analysis of 779 tests of no-template PCR control reactions. This is
hardly a “common” contaminant. Continued repetition of this mis-statement is misleading. In
fact, using next generation sequencing technology, searching the sequences resulting from 100s of
DNA extractions, we have never found chicken DNA sequences in our results (Greig et al. 2015).
If indeed the chickens reported in the manuscript were closely related to those introduced by
Cook in October/November 1773, it is more likely that they were Pacific chickens picked up
during his visit to Tonga or Tahiti (August – October 1773) than chickens that were loaded on the
ship in England (July 1772) and maintained on board during the many months of voyaging and
trading with indigenous peoples.
In addition to these issues with the interpretations of radiocarbon dates and aDNA sequences,
references to chickens and other animals in the Pacific as presented on page 9 are out of date.
Storey (2016) provides evidence and a radiocarbon date for a prehistoric chicken bone from New
Caledonia, and there is no evidence prehistoric dogs in Vanuatu.
So, while there are major issues regarding the interpretations of the results, the data presented in
this paper could be important for understanding early European animal introductions and
translocations in the Pacific. I suspect that the paper could be rewritten and by 1) removing the
suggestion that the chicken bones are found in association with evidence of early Maori
occupation, 2) softening the argument that the radiocarbon dates are secure evidence of these
chickens being introduced in the 1770s and 3) removing statements regarding the non-Pacific
source of those chickens, this could be a valuable contribution to the literature.

Associate Editor Comments to Author ( Professor Matthew Collins):
Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
This is a very interesting article, which both reviewers would like to see published.
Referee 1 would like greater detail of the DNA data and its final repository. In addition they
would like you to confirm the novelty of haplogroup E.
Referee 2 (Lisa Matisoo-Smith) has more major concerns around the context of the bones, notably
from the Redcliffs School Site, and makes an interesting point that it would seem unlikely that on
Cook's 2nd voyage, chickens picked up in July 1772 would have survived to be dropped off in
October/November 1773, and that perhaps the animals may have been picked up en-route.
She argues therefore that a softening of the line take by the authors would be sensible.
Reviewer 1
The paper is very well researched and presents important results contributing to the long-
debated question of the chicken dispersal in Polynesia and Oceania. One area that needs to be
worked on is the integration of the genetic results in the discussion which support the European
introduction hypothesis. Once this is included, the paper will present robust evidence.

early European occupation period.
The authors go on to describe the sequencing of a short (200bp) segment of the mitochondrial
control region in two of the samples. The sequences were determined to belong to chicken
mtDNA haplogroup E as defined by previous researchers. Though they do not discuss the
implication of these DNA sequences in the text of the paper itself, they do mention in the abstract
that “The chickens belong to the mitochondrial control region haplogroup E, indicating that they
were derived from source populations outside of the Pacific.” Again, this interpretation is
misleading. Haplogroup E chickens have been described from well stratified and well dated pre-
12
European Pacific Island contexts (in Vanuatu, Samoa and, indeed, Tonga) (Storey et al. 2012;
Storey et al. 2010). The authors make the assumption that any Haplogroup E sequences found in
Pacific chickens are the result of contamination by modern European chicken DNA which they
claim is a “common contaminant of some PCR reagents” and they cite Leonard et al 2007 for this
evidence. The actual data (Leonard et al. 2007:1363) shows that only one case of chicken DNA
contamination was found in an analysis of 779 tests of no-template PCR control reactions. This is
hardly a “common” contaminant. Continued repetition of this mis-statement is misleading. In
fact, using next generation sequencing technology, searching the sequences resulting from 100s of
DNA extractions, we have never found chicken DNA sequences in our results (Greig et al. 2015).
If indeed the chickens reported in the manuscript were closely related to those introduced by
Cook in October/November 1773, it is more likely that they were Pacific chickens picked up
during his visit to Tonga or Tahiti (August – October 1773) than chickens that were loaded on the
ship in England (July 1772) and maintained on board during the many months of voyaging and
trading with indigenous peoples.
In addition to these issues with the interpretations of radiocarbon dates and aDNA sequences,
references to chickens and other animals in the Pacific as presented on page 9 are out of date.
Storey (2016) provides evidence and a radiocarbon date for a prehistoric chicken bone from New
Caledonia, and there is no evidence prehistoric dogs in Vanuatu.
So, while there are major issues regarding the interpretations of the results, the data presented in
this paper could be important for understanding early European animal introductions and
translocations in the Pacific. I suspect that the paper could be rewritten and by 1) removing the
suggestion that the chicken bones are found in association with evidence of early Maori
occupation, 2) softening the argument that the radiocarbon dates are secure evidence of these
chickens being introduced in the 1770s and 3) removing statements regarding the non-Pacific
source of those chickens, this could be a valuable contribution to the literature.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Professor Matthew Collins):
This is a very interesting article, which both reviewers would like to see published.
Referee 1 would like greater detail of the DNA data and its final repository. In addition they would
like you to confirm the novelty of haplogroup E.
Referee 2 (Lisa Matisoo-Smith) has more major concerns around the context of the bones, notably
from the Redcliffs School Site, and makes an interesting point that it would seem unlikely that on
Cook's 2nd voyage, chickens picked up in July 1772 would have survived to be dropped off in
October/November 1773, and that perhaps the animals may have been picked up en-route.
She argues therefore that a softening of the line take by the authors would be sensible.
Reviewer 1
The paper is very well researched and presents important results contributing to the long-debated
question of the chicken dispersal in Polynesia and Oceania. One area that needs to be worked on is
the integration of the genetic results in the discussion which support the European introduction
hypothesis. Once this is included, the paper will present robust evidence.
Comments to the Author(s)
This research is the first to combine ancient DNA and radiocarbon dating to investigate the
introduction of chickens in New Zealand, an important question that yet remains unknown. The
study selected 3 of the earliest chicken bones found in New Zealand, with radiocarbon dates falling
in the 18th century or later, while their genetic signatures belonged to the globally-distributed
haplogroup E. The authors conclude that chickens were most likely introduced in New Zealand by
the Europeans during James Cook’s second voyage and finish by discussing the impact of the
introduction of chickens on native societies.
This research answers an important question and does so by combining archaeological evidence
with dating techniques, ancient DNA and historical records. The methods used are appropriate and
replicable and the discussion is thorough. In particular, the discussion of the impact of the arrival of
chickens among the Maori tribes is a topic often missed in studies investigating the introduction of
livestock in new areas. I was very pleased to see it discussed here.
I only have a list of minor corrections:
1) Although detailed in the discussion, it would be useful to have a sentence or two in the
introduction mentioning the date of the first European contact, the date of the first permanent
European settlement and whether or not European inter-island voyages were occurring between
these two dates.
The introduction focusses on the apparent absence of prehistoric chickens in New Zealand, and how
this is anomalous considering that chickens were widely dispersed to other Polynesian islands by the
first settlers. In doing so it sets up the aim of our study, i.e. to provide the first scientific analyses of
“ideal candidates for … potentially prehistoric chicken specimens” from New Zealand. It is not until
our results show that the bones are not prehistoric that mentioning European history becomes
relevant (hence why it is presented in the discussion). Unfortunately, we cannot see any place where
this could be brought into the introduction without it seeming out of place.
2) The authors mention that this is the first study which undertakes both radiocarbon dating and
ancient DNA on chicken bones in New Zealand, yet the genetic results are not discussed once in the
discussion. There needs to be at least one paragraph providing some genetic background (worldwide
dominance of haplogroup E and Polynesian chicken genetic signature belonging to haplogroup D)
and some discussion regarding the genetic results of the two chicken bones currently under study.
We have added details of this to the discussion, e.g. “DNA sequences from the RSS and MP chicken
bones were both from the globally-distributed E-haplogroup, and so did not provide any information
on the potential place of origin”.
3) The authors mention that both of their bones belong to haplogroup E but that one of them is a
novel haplotype. However, more than 67 mitochondrial DNA haplotypes exist (Supplementary Table
1) and I would like to know if the authors have used BLAST to ensure their haplotype is novel. If so,
please mention this in the 5.3 Ancient DNA section. If not, please conduct a BLAST search to ensure
your haplotype is novel and include the results in the 5.3 Ancient DNA section.
We performed a BLAST search as suggested by the reviewer. The nearest matches had 99%
similarity, confirming that this is a unique haplotype. We have added these details to the results
section.
4) Please provide fragment length of the amplified DNA sequence and the gene you looked at
(control region of the mitochondrial DNA) under ‘2.2 Ancient DNA’
We have added this information to the manuscript: “Ancient DNA (201 bp of mitochondrial control
region) was amplified and sequenced from the two oldest chicken bones”.
5) The sequences need to be submitted to Genbank and the Genbank Accession Number to be
included in the paper (in particular due to the novel haplotype).
We have submitted these sequences to Genbank (embargoed until 31 July 2016) and added the
accession numbers to Table S1 and the main manuscript.
6) In supplementary Table 1, please provide a column with Genbank accession number and a column
for their corresponding source
We have added these columns in Table S1.
Reviewer 2 Prof Lisa Matisoo-Smith,
The manuscript, “Origin and timing of New Zealand’s earliest domestic chickens: Polynesian
commensals or European introductions?” by Wood et al., presents an interesting study – testing the
often argued assumption that chickens were not introduced to New Zealand by Maori colonists prior
to European arrival in the Pacific. The paper describe radiocarbon dates for three archaeological
chicken bones recovered from sites in New Zealand that contain evidence of early Maori occupation
and DNA data for two of these bones. The authors argue that based on the three radiocarbon dates,
of which the median age of two falls at ~1760, a period which pre-dates permanent European
settlement (1830s), these were likely chickens that were descendants of those introduced by Capt.
James Cook or Tobias Furneaux in 1773.
Unfortunately the interpretation of their results is flawed.
The authors state that “we provide the first radiocarbon and aDNA analyses of chicken bones from
prehistoric Maori middens.” This statement is misleading.
We have amended this statement to “Here, we provide the first radiocarbon and aDNA analyses of
chicken bones from sites of Maori middens containing prehistoric material.”
The chicken bones used in the analysis came from collections held in the Canterbury Museum, which
were “collected some decades prior to this study, and there were not exact details on stratigraphic
contexts available...”. They then cite one reference, Jacomb 2009, for the fact that one of the sites
(Redcliffs School Site) is “considered to exclusively represent the earliest phase of human settlement
in New Zealand”. They neglect to point out that Jacomb 2009:21 also states that “subsequent earth
disturbance from residential activities resulted in the introduction of modern material into the site
including sheep and chicken bones as well as glass, bricks and nails.” Jacomb goes on further to point
out that the chicken bones were only found in the modern, disturbed layers (Jacomb 2009:22).
We have changed this sentence to “Archaeological sites on Redcliffs Flat (which includes the Redcliffs
School site) span from the earliest phase of human settlement in New Zealand to recent times [23].”
Redcliffs is a complicated complex of sites and requires a great deal more work to understand fully.
Although all previous radiocarbon dates from Redcliffs reflect the “earliest phase of human
settlement”, we acknowledge that this is probably because materials for dating were selected from
such stratigraphic contexts. However, as Jacomb (2009: 25) points out, “more radiocarbon
determinations on reliable samples are needed to date the site with any certainty”. Our radiocarbon
dated chicken bone therefore helps improve our understanding of the site.
The upper layers of middens can often be mixed by post-European ground surface disturbance (e.g.
earthworks), and from the description in Jacomb (2009) this appears to be the case at Redcliffs.
However, it is entirely possible that these ‘modern layers’ could also include material from the
earliest post-European contact era (e.g. chicken bone); the significance of which would perhaps go
unrealised if they were mixed with other items of slightly later European origin (such as sheep bones
or bricks) and weren’t radiocarbon dated because they were assumed to be contemporaneous.
When Jacomb (2009: 22) reports that “The pukeko and chicken bones were found either in the
modern Layer 1 overburden in Trench 2 or in the modern rubbish pit in Trench 3 and are not part of
the prehistoric faunal sample” he is specifically talking about samples from his excavations (i.e.
trenches 2 and 3). The chicken bone used in our study was excavated by Michael Trotter in June
1969, not by Jacomb in the mid-2000s. Inferring that it too originated in ‘modern’ layers, and is
therefore of recent age, reflects the dogma that we discuss in the introduction to our manuscript,
i.e.: “Chicken bones in Maori middens are usually assumed to represent disturbance and
incorporation of recent material into older layers [e.g. 26]. In some sites this is clearly likely,
especially where stratigraphy is clearly disturbed, and/or where other items such as sheep (Ovis
aries) bones, or glass, are also present [e.g. 23, 24]. However, such dogma creates the potential for
genuine prehistoric chicken remains to be overlooked.”
Since submission we have managed to locate some details about the excavated material associated
with the Redcliffs chicken bone in the Canterbury Museum register (which we have now added to
the supporting information). The register gives the exact position of the chicken bone as square B6,
upper layer (June 1969 excavation). Associated material from this square/layer included native birds
(Eudyptes penguin, spotted shag and little penguin) – with no mention of sheep or other introduced
mammals. The upper layer of the adjacent square (C6) also contained native birds, including stout
legged moa, kereru, broad-billed prion, parakeet, grey duck and another chicken bone. The
association with apparently pre-European fauna justifies our selection of this chicken bone to
analyse.
No references are given for the other two sites, Mussel Point and Fyffe’s Site, so it is difficult to
assess the context. In particular, there is no evidence presented or reference cited that “...the
chicken bones were found in association with bones of large bird species that went extinct in the
first 200 years after initial settlement...”. In fact, if they were found in association with Moa bones,
this would be clear evidence of significant disturbance.
Details of all three sites (including key references) are provided in supporting information (the
reviewer may not have been provided with this during the review, but in the methods section we
state “Further details of the study sites are presented in supporting information.”). When we said
that the chicken bones were found “in association with bones of large bird species that went extinct
in the first 200 years after initial settlement” our intended meaning was that they were found at the
same sites as bones of these large birds, but with an absence of any detailed stratigraphic context
the exact relationships were unclear. We can see how this may create a slight confusion, as “in
association” could also be used to refer to occurrence within the same stratigraphic layer. We have
changed the use of “in association” throughout the manuscript to clarify this.
Archaeologists are very clear about the problems of interpreting single radiocarbon dates from
archaeological sites, as individual sample and site context is particularly important and part of the
growing trend in “chronometric hygiene”. Interpreting events with accuracy to a period of less than
100 years based on single dates from two sites, with no archaeological context is highly problematic.
Regardless, the results are interesting as these bones may indeed date to an early European
occupation period.
As we see it, the rationale for stratigraphic association being a key principle of chronometric hygiene
is to avoid radiocarbon dates from natural (i.e. potentially prehuman) remains being misinterpreted
as being from a cultural context. For example, if a moa bone was found near an eroding midden site
in New Zealand and inferred to be from a butchered individual, but returned a radiocarbon age of
2,000 years BP, then the fact that the bone had no secure stratigraphic or cultural context would
mean it would be rejected under chronometric hygiene and should not be used as evidence for early
settlement. However, this principle does not apply to the remains of species that are known to have
been introduced by humans (such as chicken). In the case of New Zealand chickens (where there is
clear potential for disturbance and mixing of upper layers in midden sites) we would argue that
relying on archaeological context is problematic, and that radiocarbon dates provide the only robust
evidence for the actual ages of these bones.
The authors go on to describe the sequencing of a short (200bp) segment of the mitochondrial
control region in two of the samples. The sequences were determined to belong to chicken mtDNA
haplogroup E as defined by previous researchers. Though they do not discuss the implication of
these DNA sequences in the text of the paper itself, they do mention in the abstract that “The
chickens belong to the mitochondrial control region haplogroup E, indicating that they were derived
from source populations outside of the Pacific.” Again, this interpretation is misleading.
We have changed this sentence to: “The chickens belong to the widespread mitochondrial control
region haplogroup E.”
Haplogroup E chickens have been described from well stratified and well dated pre-European Pacific
Island contexts (in Vanuatu, Samoa and, indeed, Tonga) (Storey et al. 2012; Storey et al. 2010). The
authors make the assumption that any Haplogroup E sequences found in Pacific chickens are the
result of contamination by modern European chicken DNA which they claim is a “common
contaminant of some PCR reagents” and they cite Leonard et al 2007 for this evidence. The actual
data (Leonard et al. 2007:1363) shows that only one case of chicken DNA contamination was found
in an analysis of 779 tests of no-template PCR control reactions. This is hardly a “common”
contaminant. Continued repetition of this mis-statement is misleading. In fact, using next generation
sequencing technology, searching the sequences resulting from 100s of DNA extractions, we have
never found chicken DNA sequences in our results (Greig et al. 2015).
The identity of haplogroups within prehistoric Pacific chickens, and the potential role of reagent
contaminants in producing non-endogenous sequences from poor-quality bones, are highly-
contentious issues that have generated vigorous debate in scientific literature over the past few
years (see references within Thomson et al. 2014, PNAS 111: E3585–E3586). However, as the New
Zealand chicken bones were not prehistoric, this debate has no bearing on the conclusions of our
paper. Although, in our experience, contaminating sequences attributable to chicken turn up more
frequently than the reviewer’s comments might suggest (for example, reagent negative controls in
Wood et al. 2016 J. Arch. Sci. Rep. 6: 496-505), we have changed the sentence in our manuscript to
“chicken DNA is a known contaminant of some PCR reagents…”.
If indeed the chickens reported in the manuscript were closely related to those introduced by Cook
in October/November 1773, it is more likely that they were Pacific chickens picked up during his visit
to Tonga or Tahiti (August – October 1773) than chickens that were loaded on the ship in England
(July 1772) and maintained on board during the many months of voyaging and trading with
indigenous peoples.
This is entirely possible, and we do not dispute this. In fact, Cook states “I went to the cove where
the natives resided…and took with me a young boar and a sow, two Cocks and two hens I had
brought from the Isles and gave them to the Natives” [Beaglehole 1961: 287]. Although exactly
which isles Cook is referring to (England, Cape Verde, Tonga or Tahiti) is unclear, the latter would
seem very plausible, especially considering chickens were not liberated in NZ until after the voyage
had returned from the Pacific Islands. However, as we state above, because our chickens bones were
not prehistoric, and because they were the widespread E-haplogroup, we cannot (and now do not)
make any assumptions about their exact place of origin. A number of European expeditions had
visited Tonga and Tahiti prior to Cook, and so we also cannot rule out chickens of European origin
having been present there at the time of Cook’s visit.
Although where the chickens were collected from has no bearing on the conclusions of our paper, it
is nonetheless an interesting question. In fact, there are a range of locations from which chickens or
‘poultry’ were acquired during Cook’s second voyage. For example:
• Although we could find no evidence for chickens being taken from England it seems likely
some would have been on board for the supply of meat and eggs en route.
• Poultry were acquired at Cape Verde Islands (August 1772) [Beaglehole 1961: 27].
• Shortly after several weeks in port at Cape of Good Hope (30 November 1772), it was
recorded in the ships log for the Adventure that a large sea “washed two hen coops (from off
the Awning) overboard.” [C. Thornton pers comm.].
• Poultry were mentioned as still being on board the Resolution in December 1772
[Beaglehole 1961: 56].
So, although Tahiti/Tonga seem a likely source for the NZ chickens, we also cannot rule out the NZ
chickens having been a mixture collected from different localities. We have added a paragraph to
the discussion section describing these potential source localities of the chickens.
In addition to these issues with the interpretations of radiocarbon dates and aDNA sequences,
references to chickens and other animals in the Pacific as presented on page 9 are out of date.
Storey (2016) provides evidence and a radiocarbon date for a prehistoric chicken bone from New
Caledonia, and there is no evidence prehistoric dogs in Vanuatu.
We have changed this sentence to “For example, in New Caledonia, pigs were not introduced
prehistorically, despite the relatively close proximity to source islands (Vanuatu)”.
So, while there are major issues regarding the interpretations of the results, the data presented in
this paper could be important for understanding early European animal introductions and
translocations in the Pacific. I suspect that the paper could be rewritten and by 1) removing the
suggestion that the chicken bones are found in association with evidence of early Maori occupation,
2) softening the argument that the radiocarbon dates are secure evidence of these chickens being
introduced in the 1770s and 3) removing statements regarding the non-Pacific source of those
chickens, this could be a valuable contribution to the literature.
In line with the reviewers suggestions, we have: 1) removed the use of the word ‘association’, which
was perhaps causing confusion by inadvertently suggesting the chicken bones shared a stratigraphic
context with early Maori occupation; and 2) removing the one statement (in abstract) regarding the
source location of the chickens. However, we feel there is no scientific basis for softening our stance
that the radiocarbon dating results provides strong support for these chickens having been
introduced in the 1770s. Neither reviewer has specifically raised concerns regarding the reliability of
the radiocarbon dating results, and the only argument against the 1770s age was an inferred
‘association’ of chicken bones at one of the sites with modern artefacts (which was a disturbed layer,
and actually not the excavation from which our chicken bone was recovered).
