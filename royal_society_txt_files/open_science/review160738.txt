This manuscript contains a valuable contribution – sentinel behavior by animals living without a
group. This phenomenon has been mentioned before but not quantified in the literature. This
manuscript reports data from 38 adult Arabian babblers living both in groups and as floaters in
the territory of another group. As floaters, Arabian babblers watched from high positions and
gave alarm calls. Although I have stressed coordination of bouts as the testable feature of
sentinel behavior, I agree that analogous behavior by solitary babblers is best labeled as sentinel
behavior. Arabian babblers performed sentinel behavior and gave alarm calls as floaters. Because
floaters have no social group, these observations suggest that sentinel behavior and alarm calling
are not directed toward other members of the social group.
Sentinel behavior in groups depended on the sex and rank of the individual, while sentinel
behavior among floaters was lower and did not depend on sex or the rank the babbler had
previously held in a social group.
A comprehensive analysis has been performed accounting for repeated observations of
individuals and interactions among fixed effects. This analysis should be reported in full. The
interactions with status (floater vs. group member) are especially relevant, though some care is
needed because rank and sex are broadly correlated in Arabian babblers. Currently the
manuscript mostly reports simple comparisons that could be regarded as multiple comparisons
following up on parts of the comprehensive analysis.
I suggest that a really good figure or two would organize the results in a way that readers can
quickly grasp the main points, and put secondary points into a general framework. I think the
most revealing graph would should the time as sentinels for all 38 individuals when alone and
when in a group, with the individuals groups into male and females, dominants and
subordinates. A possibility would be to give all the in group results in one column, the floater
results in another, label points by sex & status (e.g. darkened squares for dominant males, open
squares for subordinate males … ), and connect points for the same individual with a dotted line
between columns. Such a figure would show a bunch of lines moving in the same direction, but it
might not be easy to see any effects of sex or status. Separating the data into two or four pairs on
columns could help for these comparisons, and I suggest that placing the pairs across the page
would most quickly show the convergence of results for floaters. Without looking at the data
directly, I am leaning toward a pair of columns for males, a pair of columns for females, and
denoting dominants and subordinates within each column with open and filled symbols. (My
thinking is that the study has 15 males and 23 females, 7 of the 15 males were dominants, while
only 4 of the 23 females were dominants. Therefore splitting into four sets would leave only 4
birds for the dominant female category.)
I agree that the main result is that floaters do a lot of sentinel behavior and alarm calling. I offer
some alternative ideas for why sex and rank make a difference in groups, and not among floaters.
I do not doubt that Arabian babblers have rich social lives, and that social functions of sentinel
behavior are highly plausible. The point is that the current data might be consistent with other
explanations.
a) Group members can forage more quickly when others are sentinels, and this means they
reach a state to be a sentinel more quickly. If high ranking birds are further able to monopolize
the best foraging spots or scrounge food found by others, foraging speed might explain the
differences between floaters and group members and of rank and sex among group members.
b) Floaters are former group members, and may be weakened in some way that affects their
sentinel behavior. If high ranking birds are weakened more along the way to becoming floaters,
this could explain a greater drop in sentinel behavior.
3
Overall, these are valuable data and should be conveyed to a wide audience. Summarizing the
data in a visually compelling way is the most important step forward. If the patterns are obvious
to readers, they can mostly be left to judge potential explanations for the patterns.
Secondary points:
Line 64-70: Please consistently use either singular or plural when saying something about a
species. I advocate for the plural (e.g. Arabian babblers) as most consistent with reporting
observations of known individuals.
Line 277: Starting observations just after a sentinel bout would likely lead to a lower estimate of
sentinel behavior than would starting at a random moment. It is unlikely, however, to contribute
to the difference observed between floaters and group members.
Line 319-320: Please rearrange to “During 456 hours of observation, 38 floaters performed 726
sentinel events …”
Line 427: Because “nuclear” means very different things in physics and in politics, please find a
different word for your meaning. Perhaps “fundamental” would do.

Review for RSOS 160738: The sentinel behaviour of Arabian babbler floaters.
Summary
This paper analyses data from a long term study of habituated Arabian babblers to show that the
sentinel behaviour of floaters (singleton birds living within the territories of groups) differs from
that of group living birds. The authors then present some relatively unsubstantiated reasoning
suggesting a social explanation for sentinel behaviour by floaters.
The data appear robust, if unexciting (though they do represent a heroic amount of field work in
extremely challenging conditions). The analytical approach needs clarifying and the results could
4
be more clearly and concisely presented. The main problem with the paper is the interpretation
given to the data: the authors emphasise the social function of sentinel behaviour (detecting
territory holders), while downplaying the much simpler explanation (that singletons still need to
watch out for predators). The data are worth presenting, especially so that they can be available
to those conducting comparative analyses on the causes and consequences of variation in
individual contributions to cooperative behaviour.
Specific points:
1. Abstract, Lines 29-31: “while within a group dominants sentineled more than subordinates and
males more than females, as floaters they sentineled all alike, and less than they did as group
members”. No – the results tables DO NOT show an interaction effect between life history
category and group membership: they merely show main effects of life history category and
group membership. Based on the results tables, you can only say that all birds reduced their
sentinel behaviour equally. I think confusion about interpreting the model output continues in
the Discussion, and has led to some of the less defensible claims made there.
2. Lines 31-34: “the latter suggests that avoiding detection by the territory owners was a concern
for floaters, and hence that detecting foreign con-specifics may be one of the incentives for
sentinel activity also for group members.” Here and elsewhere, the logic is entirely unclear. WHY
do these results suggest this? It is not at all clear that they do. Much more needs to be done to
explain and justify this, and to rule out alternatives (such as simple predator detection).
3. Line 47: should start with “in SOME group living animals”.
4. The MS would probably benefit from some proofreading and editing by a native (or more
proficient) English speaker. It is perfectly intelligible, but the usage or grammar is a bit peculiar in
many places (for example line 82, where incomplete coverage sentinels is described as ‘not
perfect’). There is also heavy use of very anthropomorphic language (such as dominants
‘renouncing’ their position to leave to ‘exile’). This needs to be toned down.
5. Line 90-92: give citation for evidence of a linear hierarchy (which would ideally contain the
methodology for how this is measured).
6. The Introduction as a whole lacks a clear set of questions or hypotheses. You need to be much
more explicit about WHY you expect floaters to differ in their sentinel behaviour, and make some
clear predictions. Ideally, these should be stated clearly in the final paragraph.
7. Lines 158-164: the material here seems to have been haphazardly added as an afterthought. It
needs to go earlier. The final paragraph of the Intro should be a clear statement about what the
authors expect to find and why.
8. Lines 202-212: there are a lot of assumptions being made here that need much clearer and more
robust justification.
9. Lines 214-217: wording unclear.
10. Somewhere in the Methods you need to clearly set out the criteria used to classify sentinel
behaviour as such.
11. Lines 269-273: vague.
12. Line 279-280: “we assums that this time is enough for the babblers to ignore human presence”.
Based on what?
13. Statistical analysis: there needs to be more detail on how the models were constructed. It is
unclear in both the methods and the results whether you built full models containing all possible
explanatory terms, and then used some kind of model reduction approach – or whether you just
tested specific sets of terms on their own. The layout of the tables suggests the latter, but it is
unclear. It would also be very good to somewhere see the variance components associated with
the random terms.
14. It seems that Tables 1 and 2 are unnecessary: all the relevant information is contained in Table
3.
15. Line 376: unclear wording.
16. Results section in general: really needs to be reformatted and re-structured to be made much
clearer and more concise.
17. The Discussion is over long, by about half, and much of the logic is either unclear or not fully
justified (see comments above).

Review for RSOS 160738: The sentinel behaviour of Arabian babbler floaters.
Summary
This paper analyses data from a long term study of habituated Arabian babblers to show that the
sentinel behaviour of floaters (singleton birds living within the territories of groups) differs from
that of group living birds. The authors then present some relatively unsubstantiated reasoning
suggesting a social explanation for sentinel behaviour by floaters.
The data appear robust, if unexciting (though they do represent a heroic amount of field work in
extremely challenging conditions). The analytical approach needs clarifying and the results could
be more clearly and concisely presented. The main problem with the paper is the interpretation
given to the data: the authors emphasise the social function of sentinel behaviour (detecting
territory holders), while downplaying the much simpler explanation (that singletons still need to
watch out for predators). The data are worth presenting, especially so that they can be available
to those conducting comparative analyses on the causes and consequences of variation in
individual contributions to cooperative behaviour.
Specific points:
1. Abstract, Lines 29-31: “while within a group dominants sentineled more than subordinates and
males more than females, as floaters they sentineled all alike, and less than they did as group
members”. No – the results tables DO NOT show an interaction effect between life history
category and group membership: they merely show main effects of life history category and
group membership. Based on the results tables, you can only say that all birds reduced their
sentinel behaviour equally. I think confusion about interpreting the model output continues in
the Discussion, and has led to some of the less defensible claims made there.
2. Lines 31-34: “the latter suggests that avoiding detection by the territory owners was a concern
for floaters, and hence that detecting foreign con-specifics may be one of the incentives for
sentinel activity also for group members.” Here and elsewhere, the logic is entirely unclear. WHY
do these results suggest this? It is not at all clear that they do. Much more needs to be done to
explain and justify this, and to rule out alternatives (such as simple predator detection).

I appreciate the careful revision, and the comprehensive analysis and compelling new graph
show the results in a clear and compelling manner. One detail left from the analyses is that F
ratios should generally be reported with both numerator and denominator degrees of freedom --
e.g. F(1, 35).
In reading the manuscript, I could see lots places where revision had clarified and extended
matters. I commend these effort, and have a few further suggestions toward improving the
presentation of these interesting results.
lines 115-119: Please rewrite without "stronger" unless you have data besides the observation of
winning and "of their own will" as secondary to the observation that they seemed to try to join
another group, and ended up with no group. Here and elsewhere, the observations are
interesting on their own. Just write with the babblers as the subject of the sentence and their
action as the verb.
I do not like "status" for in a group vs. floating alone as it is easy to confuse with rank. I do not at
this minute have a better suggestion than "floating/in group" for the name of this important
variable.
line 218-219: Instead of the distracting dichotomy "left their group voluntarily or were chased
away," please say that you did not observe how they left the group.
line 324: "All floaters, with no exception, acted as sentinels." can be said once strongly "All
floaters acted as sentinels."
I look forward to seeing the final version when it come out of the press.
with best wishes,
Peter

I appreciate the careful revision, and the comprehensive analysis and compelling new graph
show the results in a clear and compelling manner. One detail left from the analyses is that F
ratios should generally be reported with both numerator and denominator degrees of freedom --
e.g. F(1, 35).
In reading the manuscript, I could see lots places where revision had clarified and extended
matters. I commend these effort, and have a few further suggestions toward improving the
presentation of these interesting results.
lines 115-119: Please rewrite without "stronger" unless you have data besides the observation of
winning and "of their own will" as secondary to the observation that they seemed to try to join
another group, and ended up with no group. Here and elsewhere, the observations are
interesting on their own. Just write with the babblers as the subject of the sentence and their
action as the verb.
I do not like "status" for in a group vs. floating alone as it is easy to confuse with rank. I do not at
this minute have a better suggestion than "floating/in group" for the name of this important
variable.
line 218-219: Instead of the distracting dichotomy "left their group voluntarily or were chased
away," please say that you did not observe how they left the group.
line 324: "All floaters, with no exception, acted as sentinels." can be said once strongly "All
floaters acted as sentinels."
I look forward to seeing the final version when it come out of the press.

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript contains a valuable contribution – sentinel behavior by animals living
without a group. This phenomenon has been mentioned before but not quantified in
the literature. This manuscript reports data from 38 adult Arabian babblers living both
in groups and as floaters in the territory of another group. As floaters, Arabian
babblers watched from high positions and gave alarm calls. Although I have stressed
coordination of bouts as the testable feature of sentinel behavior, I agree that
analogous behavior by solitary babblers is best labeled as sentinel behavior. Arabian
babblers performed sentinel behavior and gave alarm calls as floaters. Because
floaters have no social group, these observations suggest that sentinel behavior and
alarm calling are not directed toward other members of the social group.
Sentinel behavior in groups depended on the sex and rank of the individual, while
sentinel behavior among floaters was lower and did not depend on sex or the rank the
babbler had previously held in a social group.
A comprehensive analysis has been performed accounting for repeated observations
of individuals and interactions among fixed effects. This analysis should be reported
in full.
The interactions with status (floater vs. group member) are especially relevant, though
some care is needed because rank and sex are broadly correlated in Arabian babblers.
Currently the manuscript mostly reports simple comparisons that could be regarded as
multiple comparisons following up on parts of the comprehensive analysis.
We have completely revised the presentation of the results, and the statistical
analysis now appears in full (Tables 2 and 3). All 2-way interactions (in
particular with Status) are part of the model, and are now reported in the
tables. The ranking hierarchy in the data is separate for males and females (in
particular there are one dominant male and one dominant female in each
group).
I suggest that a really good figure or two would organize the results in a way that
readers can quickly grasp the main points, and put secondary points into a general
framework. I think the most revealing graph would should the time as sentinels for all
38 individuals when alone and when in a group, with the individuals groups into male
group results in one column, the floater results in another, label points by sex & status
(e.g. darkened squares for dominant males, open squares for subordinate males … ),
and connect points for the same individual with a dotted line between columns. Such
a figure would show a bunch of lines moving in the same direction, but it might not be
easy to see any effects of sex or status. Separating the data into two or four pairs on
columns could help for these comparisons, and I suggest that placing the pairs across
the page would most quickly show the convergence of results for floaters. Without
looking at the data directly, I am leaning toward a pair of columns for males, a pair of
columns for females, and denoting dominants and subordinates within each column
with open and filled symbols. (My thinking is that the study has 15 males and 23
females, 7 of the 15 males were dominants, while only 4 of the 23 females were
dominants. Therefore splitting into four sets would leave only 4 birds for the
dominant female category.)
We are grateful for this insightful suggestion. The proposed graph now
appears as figure 1 in the revision.
I agree that the main result is that floaters do a lot of sentinel behavior and alarm
calling. I offer some alternative ideas for why sex and rank make a difference in
groups, and not among floaters. I do not doubt that Arabian babblers have rich social
lives, and that social functions of sentinel behavior are highly plausible. The point is
that the current data might be consistent with other explanations.
a) Group members can forage more quickly when others are sentinels, and this
means they reach a state to be a sentinel more quickly. If high ranking birds are
further able to monopolize the best foraging spots or scrounge food found by others,
foraging speed might explain the differences between floaters and group members and
of rank and sex among group members.
b) Floaters are former group members, and may be weakened in some way that
affects their sentinel behavior. If high ranking birds are weakened more along the way
to becoming floaters, this could explain a greater drop in sentinel behavior.
We have incorporated these two alternative explanations both in the abstract
and in the discussion.
Overall, these are valuable data and should be conveyed to a wide audience.
Summarizing the data in a visually compelling way is the most important step
forward. If the patterns are obvious to readers, they can mostly be left to judge
potential explanations for the patterns.
Secondary points:
Line 64-70: Please consistently use either singular or plural when saying something
about a species. I advocate for the plural (e.g. Arabian babblers) as most consistent
with reporting observations of known individuals.
Done. Lines 68-74. The revision has also undergone expert language editing.
Line 277: Starting observations just after a sentinel bout would likely lead to a lower
estimate of sentinel behavior than would starting at a random moment. It is unlikely,
members.
We agree with this observation. Given the conclusion that our methods are
unlikely to introduce a bias in the comparison of a floater's sentinel activity to
its own past sentinel activity as a group member, we maintained the text as is.
Line 319-320: Please rearrange to “During 456 hours of observation, 38 floaters
performed 726 sentinel events …”
Done. Lines 324-325.
Line 427: Because “nuclear” means very different things in physics and in politics,
please find a different word for your meaning. Perhaps “fundamental” would do.
Done. Line 447.

Review for RSOS 160738: The sentinel behaviour of Arabian babbler floaters.
Summary
This paper analyses data from a long term study of habituated Arabian babblers to
show that the sentinel behaviour of floaters (singleton birds living within the
territories of groups) differs from that of group living birds. The authors then present
some relatively unsubstantiated reasoning suggesting a social explanation for sentinel
behaviour by floaters.
The data appear robust, if unexciting (though they do represent a heroic amount of
field work in extremely challenging conditions). The analytical approach needs
clarifying and the results could be more clearly and concisely presented.
We have completely revised the presentation of the results. The statistical
analysis is now presented in full in tables 2 and 3, and the Results section is
now shorter and more condensed.
The main problem with the paper is the interpretation given to the data: the authors
emphasise the social function of sentinel behaviour (detecting territory holders), while
downplaying the much simpler explanation (that singletons still need to watch out for
predators).
We are grateful for this comment. Following also the suggestions of reviewer
1, both the abstract and the discussion of the revision now bring two additional
potential explanations for the difference in sentinel activity of floaters relative
to their own sentinel activity when they were group members.
conducting comparative analyses on the causes and consequences of variation in
individual contributions to cooperative behaviour.
Specific points:
1. Abstract, Lines 29-31: “while within a group dominants sentineled more than
subordinates and males more than females, as floaters they sentineled all alike, and
less than they did as group members”. No – the results tables DO NOT show an
interaction effect between life history category and group membership: they merely
show main effects of life history category and group membership. Based on the
results tables, you can only say that all birds reduced their sentinel behaviour equally.
I think confusion about interpreting the model output continues in the Discussion, and
has led to some of the less defensible claims made there.
The new table 2 in the revised Results section now brings the full statistical
analysis. In particular, the interactions between Status (within-group versus
floater) and the other two fixed effects – Rank (dominant versus subordinate)
and Sex (male versus female) are both significant. See also the discussion
following table 2.
2. Lines 31-34: “the latter suggests that avoiding detection by the territory owners was
a concern for floaters, and hence that detecting foreign con-specifics may be one of
the incentives for sentinel activity also for group members.” Here and elsewhere, the
logic is entirely unclear. WHY do these results suggest this? It is not at all clear that
they do. Much more needs to be done to explain and justify this, and to rule out
alternatives (such as simple predator detection).
The abstract (as well as the discussion) now lists three possible explanations
for the decrease in sentinel activity of floaters relative to their own sentinel
activity when they were group members.
3. Line 47: should start with “in SOME group living animals”.
Done. Line 51.
4. The MS would probably benefit from some proofreading and editing by a native (or
more proficient) English speaker. It is perfectly intelligible, but the usage or grammar
is a bit peculiar in many places (for example line 82, where incomplete coverage
sentinels is described as ‘not perfect’). There is also heavy use of very
anthropomorphic language (such as dominants ‘renouncing’ their position to leave to
‘exile’). This needs to be toned down.
Thank you for these proposals. In particular, the revision underwent expert
language editing.
5. Line 90-92: give citation for evidence of a linear hierarchy (which would ideally
contain the methodology for how this is measured).
(Lines 213-215).
6. The Introduction as a whole lacks a clear set of questions or hypotheses. You need
to be much more explicit about WHY you expect floaters to differ in their sentinel
behaviour, and make some clear predictions. Ideally, these should be stated clearly in
the final paragraph.
We added a final paragraph to the introduction with the alternative hypotheses
that the study aimed at testing (Lines 172-187).
7. Lines 158-164: the material here seems to have been haphazardly added as an
afterthought. It needs to go earlier.
This paragraph now appears earlier in the Introduction (in lines 146-158), with
improved phrasing.
The final paragraph of the Intro should be a clear statement about what the authors
expect to find and why.
We added this statement as the final paragraph of the Introduction in lines
172-187.
8. Lines 202-212: there are a lot of assumptions being made here that need much
clearer and more robust justification.
The text in these lines was not essential, and it was therefore omitted in the
revision.
9. Lines 214-217: wording unclear.
We rephrased this paragraph in the revision (lines 223-226).
10. Somewhere in the Methods you need to clearly set out the criteria used to classify
sentinel behaviour as such.
Sentinel activity is now defined clearly in lines 239-242.
11. Lines 269-273: vague.
These lines were not essential, and therefore removed in the revision.
12. Line 279-280: “we assume that this time is enough for the babblers to ignore
human presence”. Based on what?
description of the methods.
13. Statistical analysis: there needs to be more detail on how the models were
constructed. It is unclear in both the methods and the results whether you built full
models containing all possible explanatory terms, and then used some kind of model
reduction approach – or whether you just tested specific sets of terms on their own.
The layout of the tables suggests the latter, but it is unclear. It would also be very
good to somewhere see the variance components associated with the random terms.
We built full Linear Mixed Models for each of the three dependent variables.
This is now explained more explicitly in the Statistical Analysis part of the
Methods section, and the results for the fixed effects are now presented in full
in tables 2 and 3. The variance components of the random terms now appear
below the corresponding tables.
14. It seems that Tables 1 and 2 are unnecessary: all the relevant information is
contained in Table 3.
We have revised completely the presentation in the Results section. In
particular, the original Tables 1 and 2 were removed.
15. Line 376: unclear wording.
We clarified the sentence. It now reads: "There was no significant interaction
between Accumulated sentinel duration and the Number of 'alarm calls'. "
(Lines 411-412).
16. Results section in general: really needs to be reformatted and re-structured to be
made much clearer and more concise.
The Results section was re-organized according to the suggestions of the two
reviewers.
17. The Discussion is over long, by about half, and much of the logic is either unclear
or not fully justified (see comments above).
We shortened the discussion and reorganized it. In particular, we now bring
side by side three possible explanations to our findings.
