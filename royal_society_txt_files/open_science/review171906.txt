Authors experimentally studied the effect of grinding parameters on surface finish on EN8 steel.
Surface and cylindrical grinding were performed for optimization of grinding parameters for
improved surface finish. Their resulted suggested surface roughness in case of surface grinding
is better as compared to cylindrical grinding. Their predicted surface roughness (Ra) for
cylindrical and surface grinding were evaluated as 0.748 µm and 0.660 µm, which were near to
experimental value 0.757 µm and 0.655 µm, respectively, for both operations. The percentage
error of surface roughness for cylindrical and surface grinding were 1.2 % and 0.75 %
respectively. Their investigation suggested that the material and grade of grinding wheel are
most prominent factor, which influences the surface roughness for both grinding operations. The
optimum conditions of cylindrical and surface grinding parameters for lower surface roughness
for EN8 steel have been determined. There is chance that the proposed parameters might be
usable for other grinding machine significantly.
So, their presented data and experiment are well organized and it may bring positive impact for
the reader attention. Thus, the paper may be accepted.

I find this paper titled, "Optimization of Parameters in Cylindrical and Surface Grinding for
Improved Surface Finish" to be interesting and, useful for the industry. I have the following
comments:
1. This paper needs proofreading. There are few grammatical errors that need to be addressed,
3
e.g. page 1, line 26 and 39, and page 2, line 17 and 40 to name a few.
2. Can you mention the surface roughness value before grinding as well? It will be interesting to
know how Ra value of material effects the grinding operation.
3. Please mention the grinding machines used for this work.
4. Are the findings of this work applicable to a particular machine used, or can be used on any
machine?
