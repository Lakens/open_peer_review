In this paper, the dynamic stiffness of a two-span transmission line considering the interaction
between the adjacent spans is studied, and the theoretical formulas for dynamic characteristics of
the line are presented. The theory is verified through the comparison of theoretical solution and
that by means of numerical method, and parameter study is also carried out. The method is
extended to a multi-span line at the end. The topic is very interesting and the results are helpful
for the understanding of free vibration behavior of multi-span transmission lines. The reviewer
recommends the paper be published after some revision. Some comments are as the follows:
(1) Page 2, line 41-42: the expression “since galloping is a motion of the cable very close to a free
vibration” is unsuitable because galloping is actually a self-excited vibration.
(2) What are the relative errors between the theoretical results (frequency and natural mode) and
those determined by the numerical method in Fig.10?
(3) In Fig. 2, the force on the right acting on the suspension insulator string should be H2 instead
of H1?
(4) In Eqs. (3a) and (3b), what are the definitions of the symbols le1 and le2 ?
(5) Line246: T should be T1 ?
(6) Line254: “1th” should be deleted.
(7) In the finite element modeling, how many truss elements are used to simulate the suspension
insulator string? Each porcelain insulator is simulated by one truss element?
(8) In Fig.4, what is Ks ? is Kd the same as Kdyn in Eq.(24)?
(9) Lines 528-531, the subscripts i and j should be consistent?
(10) Line571: Kx should be Kdyn?
(11) In Section 3, the authors presented the dynamic stiffness of multi-span line. It is suggested
that one or two examples be added to demonstrate the validation of the theoretical solution.
(12) The sub-titles should be modified because the paper investigates not only the dynamic
stiffness but also the free vibration characteristics of the transmission lines. It is suggested that
Section 2 be divided into two sections, one discussing the dynamic stiffness and the other the free
vibration characteristics.
(13) The English expression should be improved.

The paper presents some analytical derivations to theoretically analyze the vibration response of
transmission lines. The subject of the paper is of interest because of its significant applicative
perspectives. The paper is well organized: the novel aspects of the study are clearly outlined in
the introduction, and theoretical results are validated against numerical simulations in the
subsequent sections; the influence of relevant parameters is also investigated. However, the last
part of the paper discussing the extension of the method to multi-span conductors lacks of a
validation example. In view of possible publication, the following comments have to be duly
considered and the paper revised accordingly:
• A comparison of the analytical results with those obtained by a numerical simulation must be
added for the multi-span case;
• A careful language editing is necessary: typos and misprints are disseminated throughout the
manuscript;
• Symbols must be checked (see, for instance, lines 154, 173 and 203);
• The English language must be carefully revised, possibly with the aid of a native English
speaker, because of the presence of several errors;
• Dimensions of all figures must be increased, and image resolution must be improved.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The paper develops a dynamic stiffness model for multi-span transmission lines by including the
insulator strings and inclination angle of the cables. Basically the methodology of a single span
cable is extended to two-span and multi-span transmission systems. It is admitted that such an
extension is helpful and far from being trivial, but the main criticism of the paper arises from the
fact that the authors have not researched the effect of damping in any meaningful way. The paper
cannot be accepted if damping is not given due recognition in an effective and rigorous manner,
both in the theory and the results. The effect of damping on mode shapes must be elucidated.
The discussion of results needs considerable sharpening. There are many presentational issues,
particularly on the usage of the English language. Some, but not all, of them are as follows (the
line number corresponds to the bold line number appearing in the second column from the left of
the manuscript):
Line 8: characteristic should be characteristics
Lines 9 and 10: liens should be lines
Line 10: expression of should be expression for
Lines 17-18: The sentence is defective.
Lines 26-27: Reword the sentence.
Line 30: Fig.1 should be Figure 1 because it is the beginning of a sentence.
Line 42: Defective sentence.
Lines 44-45: Defective sentence.
Line 49: A should not be in capital in the middle of a sentence.
Line 63: characteristics, not characteristic.
Line 119: The caption of Fig. 2 should not be dynamic stiffness
Line 126: A reference for Eqs. 2a and 2b is needed.
Line 336: Figure caption misplaced.
Line 580: Replace ", this" by "which"
There are many other mistakes in the usage of the English language which must be rectified. At
present the paper is not up to the standard of the Royal Society.

Appendix A
Dear Editors:
Thank you very much for your email forwarding the referees’ reviews and
valuable comments on the paper “Free vibration analysis of transmission lines based on
the dynamic stiffness method”. We have studied your comments carefully and have
made correction which we hope to meet with your approval.
According to the Reviewer #1’s suggestion, we made some revisions and
would like to add following notes:
(1) Page 2, line 41-42: the expression “since galloping is a motion of the cable very close to a free
vibration” is unsuitable because galloping is actually a self-excited vibration.
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the expression “since galloping is a motion of the cable
very close to a free vibration” has been corrected to “since some galloping characteristics are similar
to those of free vibrating suspended cable.” in the revised manuscript.
(2) What are the relative errors between the theoretical results (frequency and natural mode) and
those determined by the numerical method in Fig.10?
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the percentage errors between the modes calculated by
theoretical method and FEM have been added in the revised manuscript, as shown in Fig.10. The
relative errors between the theoretical natural frequency and those determined by the numerical
method are presented in Tab.1-4.
(3) In Fig. 2, the force on the right acting on the suspension insulator string should be H2 instead of
H1?
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the “H1” has been corrected to “H2” in the revised
manuscript.
(4) In Eqs. (3a) and (3b), what are the definitions of the symbols le1 and le2 ?
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the definitions of the symbols le1 and le2 have been
added in the revised manuscript. The added content is as follows: le1 and le2 are the effective cable
lengths of the 1st and 2nd spans, respectively.
(5) Line246: T should be T1 ?
Thanks for the reviewer’s precious proposal, T has been corrected to T1 in the revised manuscript.
(6) Line254: “1th” should be deleted.
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, “1th” has been deleted in the revised manuscript.
(7) In the finite element modeling, how many truss elements are used to simulate the suspension
insulator string? Each porcelain insulator is simulated by one truss element?
Twenty eight truss elements are used to simulate the suspension insulator string. Each porcelain
insulator is simulated by one truss element. The corresponding content is added in revised
manuscript.
(8) In Fig.4, what is Ks ? is Kd the same as Kdyn in Eq.(24)?
Thanks for the reviewer’s precious proposal, Ks is the static stiffness. The static stiffness may be
obtained from Eq.(24) by letting <U+03C9>=0. The corresponding content is added in the revised manuscript.
Kd has the same meaning as Kdyn. Kdyn is replaced by Kd for easy reading in the revised manuscript.
(9) Lines 528-531, the subscripts i and j should be consistent?
Thanks for the reviewer’s precious proposal, the subscripts i and j have been consistent, the
subscript “j” has been replaced to “i” in the revised manuscript.
(10) Line571: Kx should be Kdyn?
Kx has the same meaning as Kdyn. Kx is replaced by Kd in the revised manuscript.
(11) In Section 3, the authors presented the dynamic stiffness of multi-span line. It is suggested that
one or two examples be added to demonstrate the validation of the theoretical solution.
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, one example has been added to demonstrate the
validation of the theoretical solution in section 3 in the revised manuscript.
(12) The sub-titles should be modified because the paper investigates not only the dynamic stiffness
but also the free vibration characteristics of the transmission lines. It is suggested that Section 2 be
divided into two sections, one discussing the dynamic stiffness and the other the free vibration
characteristics.
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the sub-titles has been modified, the sub-title has been
changed to “Dynamic stiffness and modal function of two-span transmission lines”.
(13) The English expression should be improved.
Thanks for the reviewer’s precious proposals. After carefully proofread and checked the
manuscript, some inappropriate expressions have been corrected in revised manuscript in red color.
According to the Reviewer #2’s suggestion, we made some revisions and
would like to add following notes:
(1)A comparison of the analytical results with those obtained by a numerical simulation must be
added for the multi-span case;
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, one example has been added to demonstrate the
validation of the multi-span theoretical solution in section 3 in revised manuscript.
(2)A careful language editing is necessary: typos and misprints are disseminated throughout the
manuscript;
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, typos and misprints have been carefully revised in revised
manuscript.
(3) Symbols must be checked (see, for instance, lines 154, 173 and 203);
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have thoroughly checked the symbols. The symbols
that are inconsistent with the description of the paper are corrected in the revised manuscript.
(4) The English language must be carefully revised, possibly with the aid of a native English speaker,
because of the presence of several errors;
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the manuscript has been carefully proofread and checked,
some inappropriate expressions have been corrected in revised manuscript.
(5) Dimensions of all figures must be increased, and image resolution must be improved.
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, all figures and images have been improved and modified.
According to the Reviewer #3’s suggestion, we made some revisions and
would like to add following notes:
(1) It is admitted that such an extension is helpful and far from being trivial, but the main criticism
of the paper arises from the fact that the authors have not researched the effect of damping in any
meaningful way. The paper cannot be accepted if damping is not given due recognition in an
effective and rigorous manner, both in the theory and the results. The effect of damping on mode
shapes must be elucidated. The discussion of results needs considerable sharpening.
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the effect of damping on the modal shape and the
dynamic stiffness have been elucidated through two-span and three-span transmission lines,
respectively. Corresponding content have been added in section 2 and 3 in the revised manuscript.
The results showed that the damping parameter affected significantly the shape of the real
component of the symmetrical complex mode when the value of damping parameter was large.
(2) Line 8: characteristic should be characteristics
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the “characteristic” has been corrected to “characteristics”
in revised manuscript.
(3) Lines 9 and 10: liens should be lines
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the “liens” has been corrected to “lines” in revised
manuscript.
(4) Line 10: expression of should be expression for
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the “expression of” has been corrected to “expression for”
in revised manuscript.
(5) Lines 17-18: The sentence is defective.
According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the “a simplified modal function corresponding natural
frequency is derived” has been corrected to “explicit formulae are derived for the modal shapes
corresponding natural frequencies.”
(6) Lines 26-27: Reword the sentence.
According to reviewer’s suggestion, the sentence has been corrected to “The dynamic stiffness
can be applied to evaluate the dynamic response of cables and of cable-supported structures in any
cable-structure system.”
(7) Line 30: Fig.1 should be Figure 1 because it is the beginning of a sentence.
According to reviewer’s suggestion, the “Fig.1” has been corrected to “Figure 1” in revised
manuscript.
(8) Line 42: Defective sentence.
According to reviewer’s suggestion, the defective sentence has been corrected to “For instance,
the frequency and mode shape of a galloping conductor are similar to those of free vibrating
suspended cable, and internal resonance phenomena of suspended cable induced by galloping can
be observed from free vibrating suspended cable.”
(9) Lines 44-45: Defective sentence.
According to reviewer’s suggestion, the defective sentence has been corrected to “Irvine
presented a linear theory for free vibration of a horizontal single-span cable fixed at both ends and
discussed the effect of the geometrical-elastic parameter <U+03BB> on the modal shape and natural frequency.”
(10) Line 49: A should not be in capital in the middle of a sentence.
According to reviewer’s suggestion, the “A” has been corrected to “a”.
(11) Line 63: characteristics, not characteristic.
According to reviewer’s suggestion, the “characteristic” has been corrected to “characteristics”.

two-span transmission line with insulator string under external excitations.
(13) Line 126: A reference for Eqs. 2a and 2b is needed.
According to reviewer’s suggestion, the reference for Eqs.2a and 2b has been added in revised
manuscript.
(14) Line 336: Figure caption misplaced.
According to reviewer’s suggestion, the Fig.5 caption has been placed in the corresponding
position.
(15) Line 580: Replace ", this" by "which" There are many other mistakes in the usage of the English
language which must be rectified.
According to reviewer’s suggestion, the " this " has been corrected to the “which” in line 580.
Other similar issues have been carefully reviewed and revised.
