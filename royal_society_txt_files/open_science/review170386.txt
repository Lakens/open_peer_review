This manuscript describes the interaction between food odor and internal state – hunger/satiety –
on responses to social calls or white noise in young crocodiles. The authors use a good
experimental design to extract information about this complex, multisensory interaction. The
results suggest that hungry crocodiles show selective attention to social calls in the presence of
food odor, while fed crocodiles do not. The findings are innovative, and make a contribution to
the literature on the complex multisensory and internal modulators of attention and decision
making.
Minor comments
Providing the size range of the crocodiles would be useful in interpreting their size relative to the
test chamber.
A correction for multiple comparisons may be warranted given the large number of t-tests
performed. Alternatively a multivariate ANOVA may be more appropriate?

Review of RSOS-170386 Cross-sensory modulation in a future top predator, the young Nile
crocodile
This is a very interesting manuscript that describes novel experiments with Nile crocodiles and
assesses their behavioural response to olfactory and auditory stimuli in either fasted or sated
states. The authors found that the state the animal was tested in led to different responses to
stimuli from the different modalities with fasted individuals selectively attending to socially
relevant sounds in the presence of food odour cues.
I have no concerns with the manuscript but do have a few questions and edits that will improve it
in its final form.
Line 58: Is 2-3 g a typo? This seems rather small.

Line 87: What was the frequency response of the loudspeakers?
Line 137: Did the authors mean "in that zone" rather than "on that zone"?
Line 143: There is an unnecessary "-" after "west".

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
5
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.

Minor comments
Providing the size range of the crocodiles would be useful in interpreting their size relative to the test
chamber.
This information is now provided in the main text (p.3, l.50):
“…size: 33-41 cm”.
A correction for multiple comparisons may be warranted given the large number of t-tests performed.
Alternatively a multivariate ANOVA may be more appropriate?
There is considerable debate about whether Bonferroni corrections should actually be made for multiple
comparisons using the same data set (see Nakagawa S, 2004. A farewell to Bonferroni: the problems of
low statistical power and publication bias. Behavioral Ecology 15:1044-1045), since this approach can
lead to Type II errors. We have thus chosen to present the uncorrected statistical output in the Results,
and assume that we have increased the chance of committing Type I error. It is now mentioned in the
Method (p.8, l.161-162).

Line 58: Is 2-3 g a typo? This seems rather small.
It is not a typo. Each individual ate 2 or 3 pieces of chicken, each around 1 gram.
Line 87: What was the frequency response of the loudspeakers?
80-16000 Hz. This info has been added in the ms (p.5, l.87-88).
Line 137: Did the authors mean "in that zone" rather than "on that zone"?
modified to “in that zone”.
Line 143: There is an unnecessary "-" after "west".
modified.
Line 211: "Prey" shouldn't have been pluralized with an "s".
