1. The authors should provide some actual data (tables/figures) of performance on the spatial
learning task and how it differs between dominant and subordinate individuals. it would be
interesting to see the magnitude of differences.
2. The experiments were done with one group of individuals - how was this corrected for in the

This manuscript presents a detailed study on the relationship between rank and cognitive
performance. It is well-written, and the question makes an interesting contribution to the topic of
what influences group structure and outcomes. The authors use an adapted analytical method to
derive their dominance hierarchy, and perform a neat cognitive task with male pheasants. The
experiment was controlled by a design that ensured that all individuals experienced a positive
outcome from each of the 14 trials: all individuals had the same information about the task, but
needed to learn how to access it quickly. The main results are presented succinctly and clearly:
high ranking males are more likely to choose correctly between two options than lower ranking
3
males. The discussion presents various alternative explanations for the data, and we are left with
the tantalising question: does social rank influence cognitive performance, or does CP determine
social rank? If the authors have additional data on mate-guarding behaviour, or have the
statistical power to include interaction terms, they may be able to make firmer conclusions.
Main comments:
1.
The discussion gives a broad range of alternative explanations for the results, however it neglects
to mention social influences as a strategy. I wonder if lower ranking individuals performed more
poorly at this task because they usually rely more on social information than higher-ranked
individuals do?
2.
In general the statistical methods and results are very clear. However, I was surprised that you
did not include an interaction term in your main model between learning rate (i.e. trial) and rank.
This would allow you to know if individuals learn at different rates depending on rank, not just
whether they learn at all.
3.
To further refine your conclusions, I wonder if you can make greater use of your data. For
example, if mate-guarding does not correlate with social rank from your hierarchy, it may be
possible to include this as an explanatory term in your model (if the data is available) to further
examine this possible explanation for cognitive differences. You could also take advantage of
your study design to look at memory effects by comparing between the two sets of trials. Do
lower-ranked individuals show a smaller improvement than higher-ranked individuals, for
example.
Specific comments:
line 75: this information about variation in spatial memory and territorial or floater males led me
to expect this to be a part of your study. Can you indicate whether social rank correlated with
mate-guarding, either in the methods as part of your study design, or the results?
line 92-93: assume that this should be “we predict that…”
line 113: I’m assuming that this is from the 7-1 trials from the first day? This could be clearer.
line 133-134: assume that this is first 100 interactions observed of the group, rather than for each
individual!
line 153: each half
line 173: did you consider including an interaction between trial and rank? This would help to
tease apart whether individuals of different rank learn more quickly than others.
line 194-195: this is a little strong to say that there was no effect, given that p = 0.064. What is the
direction of this, marginally non-significant, trend?
line 221: this is not a criticism of your study, as I completely agree with you that testing rank and
cognition across an ecologically-relevant group size is necessary; however, here it would be nice
if you could be more explicit about what this extra information has provided us. For example,
here you state at the beginning of the paragraph that studies on dyads or small groups also found
positive correlations between rank and learning, but then you finish by stating that these kinds of
tests might not be representative of natural situations. As you found similar results, then this
doesn’t really follow!
line 230: were is italicised
line 242: apologies, I might have missed this, but did social rank correlate with mate-guarding in
your group? If not, then could you include mate-guarding as a variable in the model to get at this
potential explanation? i.e. which predicts cognitive performance most, mate-guarding or social
rank?
line 257: could you use your two sets of 7 trials to examine this? an interaction term between trial
and rank, or day & rank, perhaps, might allow you to see if there is any indication of differences
in memory across the test.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
This paper addresses the important topic of individual variation in cognition using a
straightforward spatial learning task with pheasants. The study uses a strong approach of
examining social hierarchy within a larger group (rather than a dyadic context), applying an
adapted version of Elo-ratings. The results are clear and would make a nice contribution to the
existing literature on social dominance and cognition.
Most of my comments relate to how and when the dominance data were collected; as the authors
note, the pheasants’ hierarchies are stable for short periods and are particularly flexible at the
start of the breeding season, and yet from the manuscript it is unclear when the cognitive or
behavioural data were collected (and critically, in relation to one another). Some additional
details are also needed when describing the observational methods, specifically in relation to
how, or whether, inter-observer reliability was established when recording the agonistic
interactions that were used to assess dominance.
L79: Including the months of the breeding season would be useful here, particularly as the
learning data seems to have been collected around that time.
L92: Appears to be missing a word
L97: How long were the birds housed before testing began?
L98: How were subjects identified? Rings?
L102: The dates of testing would be useful here.
L108: Length of the tunnel?
L118: Did the birds have experience with this new chamber before testing?
5
L133: Others (eg Newton-Fisher 2017) have noted that the burn-in period is variable depending
on the data. Some rationale for why 100 observations were chosen is needed here.
L128: How soon after testing was the dominance data collected?
L132: Some more details on the observations would be useful here. For example did you only
record events with a clear outcome (winner, loser)? How was interobserver reliability established
beforehand? Were observations video recorded and later coded for reliability?
L141: Was there any reason observational data wasn’t collected both before and after testing? It
seems that this would have created a more accurate picture of the hierarchy at the time of testing.
L222: This sentence could use a bit more explanation.

Associate Editor's comments:
Dear authors,
Your manuscript examining the relationship between social rank and spatial learning is a
welcome piece of research. The manuscript is very clear.
Please see my comments (below) in addition to the reviewer comments. Please note that it is best
practice, when interpreting p-values, to do as you did and treat the p=0.05 threshold as a discrete
cut off above which something is not significant and below which something is
(http://blog.amamanualofstyle.com/2012/06/18/bucking-the-trend-and-approaching-
approaching-significance/). This is because a p-value is not an effect size - one would need to rely
on other model outputs (e.g., the estimate in a GLM) to discuss effect sizes.
I look forward to receiving your revision.
My best,
Corina Logan
Associate Editor
General
Throughout the paper (including the title) the word “predict is used. However, the causal
direction of the relationship between social rank and spatial learning is correlational so it is not
possible to determine which variable predicts the other (as you state in the abstract). I would
prefer more precise language, which means changing “predict” (and “could be explained by” line
20) to something like “is associated with”.
Abstract
23 - change to “…performance, thus…”
Background
8
31 - since the emphasis of your paper is on evaluating social rank beyond dyadic interactions, I
would remove the word “dyadic” here
55 - addressing “instabilities in social structure” requires long-term repeated measures of the
social structure to determine how stable it is. It is unclear from the methods over what period of
time social structure data were collected and whether they were stable (i.e., didn’t change over
time).
70 - I can see your reasoning for why you only sampled males. However, it would be nice to also
understand whether males interact with females and whether these interactions change the
dominance hierarchy among males. Could you expand on this a bit?
83 - You just mentioned that the season is important in determining the male hierarchy. Please
state when you collected the cognitive and dominance interaction data and mention how the
season you collected your data in influences your predictions.
87 - pers. obs. by which author?
91 - of harem-holding bird species? From which species are findings being extended and why is
this a reasonable assumption?
92 - is the sentence “we expect that”?
Methods
104 - please clarify what “separate experiments” means. If you were intending for these males to
participate in the tunnel experiment, why did you assign them to another experiment?
104 - define “acquisition learning”. Trial and error learning? Individuals learned to associate a
reward (leaving the testing arena) with a location (left or right)?
107 - “H 20cm” is this the diameter of the tube? Or is it more like a square tube in which case
there is also a width associated with it?
112 - didn’t catching them stress them out and distract them from the task meaning that they
might leave t1, but for stress reasons rather than paying attention to the task? Please explain how
long it took them to return to normal behavior after being caught.
113 - why only during the first 6 trials and not all 14 trials?
119 - allowing subjects to be rewarded (exit through the correct tube) after choosing the incorrect
tube reduces the cost of making an incorrect choice and could result in no or slow learning.
123 - why a 4 day delay between trials? Because of this delay, the second set of trials might test
more what they remembered rather than assessing how well they learn spatially.
128 - why was adlib sampling used instead of continuous scan sampling of all occurrences of
particular behaviors in each section of the pen? See Altmann 1974 for details
(http://www.uwyo.edu/animalcognition/altmann1974.pdf).
130 - how were observations communicated? It seems that if the observers were visually isolated,
then they were trying to hide their presence from the birds, but communicating vocally would
draw attention to the observers. Was inter-rater reliability calculated? If not, and if it is possible
because recordings were taken, please conduct this analysis.
9
132 - how many “remaining days” were there?
134 - why is this period unreliable? Is it just unreliable for the model? Or had the birds just been
introduced in the aviary and so were getting to know each other?
- List the date range for data collection for social rank and spatial navigation.
153 - change “halve” to “half”
153 - why did you split the dataset and calculate a Spearman’s rank correlation when you only
used the mean for the full dataset?
156 - what does it mean to “determine that t1 was repeatable”? t1 is the latency to start the test?
Repeatable within individuals? If so, explain why it matters to your question.
159 - kudos for citing R packages!
160 - fully explain the binary variable: Correct (1) or Incorrect (0); and state what t1 is so people
can remember without needing to read above.
162 - I don’t understand what this sentence means: “This model was fitted on 13 trials, after the
first trial was removed and included as an explanatory variable”. Why did you remove the first
trial? Was the first trial the only trial in the “trial” explanatory variable in your model?
164 - however, subjects learn from their first trials, therefore it is important to include these with
the rest of the trials to get a better idea of how each individual learned. For example, one of my
birds was learning to associate color with a reward and in his first trial he chose incorrectly, but
then chose correctly every trial thereafter. If I didn’t have his first trial performance in the dataset
I wouldn’t have understood how he learned or what learning strategy he was using.
165 - did you have convergence problems? If so, state it so it is clearer that the conversion to z
scores occurred after you started analysing your data.
168 - please show the model output for the full model (not the minimum adequate model) in a
table somewhere so people can see the results for all of the variables.
173 - write out each of these models here as you did above.
179 - please write out the model structures for your binary logistic regression models
180 - how were learning curve coefficients generated or what were the learning curve
coefficients? Please show the outputs from these models somewhere.
- I still don’t know what an Elo-rating is so please explain it earlier in the paper.
Results
187 - what does the mean correlation coefficient tell us? And why was this the split interaction
data when your methods suggest that you used the mean Elo-rating from the overall dataset?
195 - what is a GzLMM? I’m only familiar with at GLMM, which is what it looks like you used.
Explain the acronym in the methods above.
10
- what was the range of percentages of correct choices per bird across all trials?
Discussion
209 - replace “not more pronounced” with something more descriptive like “individuals that
chose correctly on their first trial did not perform better overall”
212 - “pre-existing biases” for what? Location?
213 - since your prediction was the same using your measure of social rank as it would have been
using other measures of social rank (lines 90-94), and because you didn’t compare methods of
social rank measures against each other, you can’t tell whether your measure is better than the
others or more accurate because you measured a large group. The positive correlation between
spatial navigation performance and dominance rank was clearly shown, but I don’t think you can
say anything about your measure of rank specifically.
214 - define “complex” in “complex social systems” and explain what your results contribute to
the broader view.
242-243 - I think there is a distinction between motivation and reward that is a bit confounded
here. You measured motivation as start time latency, which might be distinct from the reward
type: males that had females to return to received a larger reward for choosing the correct tube.
To assess whether these are different would require an analysis to determine whether males that
had females were better learners and not necessarily faster to start participating in the task. I’m
not suggesting you HARK (hypothesising after results are known), only that you consider
mentioning an additional alternative hypothesis.
261 - why do you think lower ranking males suffer acute stress? Is there a citation that give an
indication of this?
Data Accessibility
The data would be much more accessible if it was deposited in a data repository (e.g.,
https://knb.ecoinformatics.org), which is searchable. If it is just in supplementary material it gets
lost because search engines don’t pick this up. It’s up to you, I just thought I would point this out.
Figure Legends
301 - what does scaled mean for trial and Elo-ratings?
304 - if there were no markings in the main chamber, then remove them from the figure so you
don’t have to explain them. Also, you say that you placed them on the starting point so it is
actually a real place and not just for description?
Table 2 - Wald and p-values given at the point they were removed from the model - I’m not
aware of this being standard practice. From what I’ve read, you take the output from the model
with the final variables that are in your reduced model and report these.
Figure 2 - can you make the confidence intervals (if that is what they are - please define in the
legend) for each group (H, M, L) distinct in color so they are easier to distinguish?
CSV files - please explain somewhere what each of your column titles means and, if appropriate,
what units they are in.

The authors have adequately addressed all of my comments and I am happy with the changes.
Some minor comments: as the authors note in their response, it is difficult to know whether the
dominance data accurately represent the hierarchy at the time of testing; and while I agree that
the relationship between the two variables is interesting regardless, this could be mentioned a bit
more explicitly in the discussion. Normally, the reference to Matheos and Carranza would be
convincing enough, but as far as I can tell (although I could have missed something), it doesn’t
really provide any actual data saying that the hierarchies are stable over 3 months, only that they
chose to sample periodically like this as the hierarchies are known to change. If that is the case
and that was the whole basis for assuming the hierarchy didn’t change, then I think it’s at least
worth mentioning as a question mark in the discussion. Are there any other references that can be
used to strengthen this argument?
L233: The authors noted that first trial performance is now significant but line 233 seems to have
the old stats.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Corina Logan):
Dear authors,
Thank you very much for carefully addressing the comments on your manuscript, which is much
improved. One reviewer and I assessed your revised manuscript and we have some minor
changes to suggest. Please see our comments below.
I look forward to seeing the final version of your manuscript.
All my best,
Corina Logan
Associate Editor
Corina’s comments
Line 18 - Change “mixed sex group with an established hierarchy” to “mixed sex group with a
linear hierarchy”
Line 47 - Change “the opposite relationship between social rank and learning has been reported”
to “results have been found that are contrary to the prediction that the more dominant
individuals would be better learners”
Line 52 - It isn’t clear how your example of reversal learning and inhibitory control tasks relates
to subordinates being better learners. Please clarify.
>This needs to be made clearer and we should not assume that readers know the methods. We
have amended this sentence, lines 55-58 now read ”Alternatively, the relationship between
cognitive performance and social rank may have been confounded by the removal of specific
individuals for approximately one month, over a 3 month period; thus the experimentally
induced instabilities in social structure may have confounded the results (Bunnell & Perkins
1980).”
Current version: lines 55-59 - I still find this unclear. This paragraph seems to discuss
relationships in a broad sense, but your new sentence appears to be about a particular study. It is
unclear which individuals were removed or what one month has to do with anything. Are you
referring to something that occurred in Bunnell & Perkins’ study specifically? If so, please give
more details about how removing subjects from a group in their study can have implications
more generally that can potentially confound social rank stability.
Line 90 - One minor clarification here to indicate that the first part of the sentence refers to the
breeding season. Change
“We expect that measures of social rank are more meaningful while competition for resources is
intense, ”
to
“We expect that measures of social rank are more meaningful during the breeding season when
competition for resources is more intense, ”
18
if the latter is accurate.
Line 114 - Change “…due to their participation in a separate experiment and we expected that
their performance on the task would be affected” to “…because we expected their participation in
a different experiment to influence their performance on this task”
Line 118 - “Line 116 now reads “…(H 20cm, W 28cm, D 60cm),…” I still find this confusing
because I’m picturing the tunnel as a circular tube, which would have a diameter and length
rather than a height, width, and depth. From your dimensions, it is more likely that the tunnel
shape is rectangular. Please indicate what shape the tunnel is in the manuscript.
Line 145 - Refer to your ethogram in Table 1.
Line 149 - you say you use an “extension” of the elo-rating method and you describe the original
method, but I can’t find information on how you extended it. Please clarify.
Line 158 - Change “due to separate experiments” to “due to the subjects participating in other
experiments”
Line 181 - “If individuals are consistent in the time taken to begin the task over multiple
presentations, we can conclude that this assay of their motivation provides a meaningful
measure”
A meaningful measure of motivation? If so, I suggest rewording to
“If individuals are consistent in the time taken to begin the task over multiple presentations, we
can conclude that this assay is a meaningful measure of their motivation”
Line 182 - “R=0.231 +/- 104”. Do you mean +/- 0.104?
Line 185 - “which was necessary given the sample size” Necessary given the small or large
sample size?
Line 284 - Change “(e.g. access to females)” to “(e.g. whether they have preferential access to
females)”
Line 304 - “It is likely that the lower ranking pheasants were in receipt of a higher level of
aggression from conspecifics than higher ranking males” Can you test this with your data? If so,
you could add the results of a posthoc analysis to provide some information about whether this
would be a fruitful avenue for future research to pursue.
Table 2 - change “predictor variable” (the row just above Intercept) to “explanatory variable” to
be consistent with the terms you use in the methods.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have adequately addressed all of my comments and I am happy with the changes.
Some minor comments: as the authors note in their response, it is difficult to know whether the
dominance data accurately represent the hierarchy at the time of testing; and while I agree that
the relationship between the two variables is interesting regardless, this could be mentioned a bit
19
more explicitly in the discussion. Normally, the reference to Matheos and Carranza would be
convincing enough, but as far as I can tell (although I could have missed something), it doesn’t
really provide any actual data saying that the hierarchies are stable over 3 months, only that they
chose to sample periodically like this as the hierarchies are known to change. If that is the case
and that was the whole basis for assuming the hierarchy didn’t change, then I think it’s at least
worth mentioning as a question mark in the discussion. Are there any other references that can be
used to strengthen this argument?

Re: Group social rank is associated with performance on a spatial
discrimination task MS
14th December 2017
Dear Dr Logan,
Thank you for your comments and those of three reviewers. We found them very
helpful in improving the manuscript and were grateful for their enthusiasm.
Below, we detail our specific responses to all of the points raised and note
changes we have made to the manuscript.
We are pleased to resubmit this revised version and look forward to hearing
your decisions.
Yours sincerely,
Ellis Langley, Jayden van Horik, Mark Whiteside and Joah Madden
From the editor
General
Throughout the paper (including the title) the word “predict is used.
However, the causal direction of the relationship between social rank and
spatial learning is correlational so it is not possible to determine which
variable predicts the other (as you state in the abstract). I would prefer
more precise language, which means changing “predict” (and “could be
explained by” line 20) to something like “is associated with”
We agree that our use of language is confusing and we do not intend to suggest
causality. The word “predicted” remains in the manuscript in reference to
‘predicted probabilities’ which are values deduced from binary logistic
regression models and is statistical language, rather than inferring causality in
the relationship between social rank and learning performance. However, we
have amended other parts of the manuscript as you suggest. Specifically:
The title of the MS has now been changed to “Group social rank is associated with
performance on a spatial discrimination task”
Line 20 now reads “…is associated with…”
Line 195 now reads “…explanatory…”
Line 227 now reads “…were significant main effects…”
Line 244 in the Discussion now reads “…, nor did it relate to learning
performance.”
Abstract
23 - change to “…performance, thus…”
Line 22 now reads “…performance, thus…”
Background
31 - since the emphasis of your paper is on evaluating social rank beyond
dyadic interactions, I would remove the word “dyadic” here
We agree that the emphasis of the paper is beyond dyadic interactions and
therefore have deleted the word ‘dyadic’. Lines 31-32 now read “Social rank
arises from interactions between dominant and subordinate individuals in groups
(Drews, 1993)”
55 - addressing “instabilities in social structure” requires long-term
repeated measures of the social structure to determine how stable it is. It is
unclear from the methods over what period of time social structure data
were collected and whether they were stable (i.e., didn’t change over time).
This needs to be made clearer and we should not assume that readers know the
methods. We have amended this sentence, lines 55-58 now read ”Alternatively,
the relationship between cognitive performance and social rank may have been
confounded by the removal of specific individuals for approximately one month,
over a 3 month period; thus the experimentally induced instabilities in social
structure may have confounded the results (Bunnell & Perkins 1980).”
70 - I can see your reasoning for why you only sampled males. However, it
would be nice to also understand whether males interact with females and
whether these interactions change the dominance hierarchy among males.
Could you expand on this a bit?
During the dominance observations, we observed copulations and chases of
females. However, we did not include data on this because it did not form part of
our predictions specifically. The social rank of a male is associated with his
behaviour towards females and so we have elaborated on this. Lines 74-77 now
read “Females preferentially choose dominant males (see Mateos 1998 for review)
and non-harem-holding males sexually harass females and achieve copulations
through force (Mateos and Carranza 1995; Ridley & Hill 1987).”
83 - You just mentioned that the season is important in determining the
male hierarchy. Please state when you collected the cognitive and
dominance interaction data and mention how the season you collected
your data in influences your predictions.
This is a very important piece of information which we failed to include in the
manuscript. We have added the season that we collected the data on line 76:
“Breeding season begins in March.” We have also edited line 86 “… while they were
members of a captive, multi-individual social hierarchy during the breeding
season.” We have also elaborated on lines 86-89 “We expect that measures of
social rank are more meaningful while competition for resources is intense,
compared with the winter months in which males aggregate (Robertson, 1997) and
measures of social rank may be more difficult to detect.”
87 - pers. obs. by which author?
Lines 91-92 now read “…(pers obs – EJGL).”
91 - of harem-holding bird species? From which species are findings being
extended and why is this a reasonable assumption?
Thank you for bringing this to our attention, we agree that more justification is
needed here. Lines 95-100 now read, “Previous studies compared the task
performances of dyads (mice, Barnard & Luo, 2002; Francia et al., 2006; mountain
chickadees, Pravosudov et al., 2003; meadow voles, Spritzer et al., 2004), and show
that dominant individuals outperform subordinate individuals. If we extend these
findings, then we expect that spatial learning performance will be positively related
to social rank for individuals in a more realistic, multi-individual, social
environment.”
Following this comment we then noticed that the species name was missing from
the first mention of a reference, this has now been added to the manuscript on
line 39.
92 - is the sentence “we expect that”?
Line 98 now reads “…we expect that…”
Methods
104 - please clarify what “separate experiments” means. If you were
intending for these males to participate in the tunnel experiment, why did
you assign them to another experiment?
We did not intend to assess the learning performance of these two males. They
took part in separate experiments during which they were fitted with GPS
backpacks for collection of pilot data which involved more handling and we were
unsure how this would affect their performance during the cognitive task. We
therefore did not put test them on the task. However, they were included in the
social hierarchy later on (without the backpacks) and so thought it necessary to
include them in the methods. We have reworded lines 110-112 to make this
clearer “…two males were deliberately not tested due to their participation in a
separate experiment and we expected that their performance on the task would be
affected.”
104 - define “acquisition learning”. Trial and error learning? Individuals
learned to associate a reward (leaving the testing arena) with a location
(left or right)?
The term acquisition is confusing here and is usually used in conjunction with
‘reversal learning’. We have therefore removed it and lines 112-113 now read
“The task assayed discrimination learning in which individuals learned to associate
a location (left or right) with the reward of leaving the testing arena.”
107 - “H 20cm” is this the diameter of the tube? Or is it more like a square
tube in which case there is also a width associated with it?
The dimensions of the tunnel were now clear, we have amended the manuscript
to include the height, width and depth. Line 116 now reads “…(H 20cm, W 28cm,
D 60cm),…”
112 - didn’t catching them stress them out and distract them from the task
meaning that they might leave t1, but for stress reasons rather than paying
attention to the task? Please explain how long it took them to return to
normal behavior after being caught.
We agree that stress is factor that could be involved with testing and we should
address in the manuscript. Lines 122-124 now read “These procedures may have
caused stress to the birds, however upon placement on the starting point
individuals did not exhibit behavioural indicators of stress such as panting or flight
behaviour (inclusive of running).”
113 - why only during the first 6 trials and not all 14 trials?
Unfortunately, t1 data for the remaining trials were lost and we only have the
first six trial start times available to us. This was part of our reason for
conducting repeatability analysis. We demonstrate that t1 was repeatable which
indicates consistency in start time and so we assume that individuals continue to
be consistent in their start times for the remainder of the task. Consequently, we
use mean t1 in the final model. For clarification, lines 124-126 now read “We
recorded time to leave the starting point (t1), but due to lost data, only consider t1
from the first six trials as a measure of motivation to participate in the task.”
119 - allowing subjects to be rewarded (exit through the correct tube) after
choosing the incorrect tube reduces the cost of making an incorrect choice
and could result in no or slow learning.
This is certainly true, but we show that there was overall improvement in
learning performance, which suggests that even with these methods, there was
enough ‘incentive’ for learning.
123 - why a 4 day delay between trials? Because of this delay, the second
set of trials might test more what they remembered rather than assessing
how well they learn spatially.
We are grateful for the suggestion and agree it’s an interesting avenue for
research however this was not the initial target of our study. Due to logistical
constraints involving other experiments with separate birds, this data collection
had a gap between the first and second set of trials. However, we did run a
separate binomial GLMM on the data with Correct (1 yes / 0 no) as the response
variable and an interaction between mean Elo-rating and day of testing (this
could not be included in the main model due to sample size) and it was not
significant, nor was the main effect of ‘day’ after model simplification. As there
was no positive or negative effect on performance after the gap between testing,
and because it may change the manuscript considerably, we would prefer not to
include it. Please see model summary table below for your interest and Wald
statistics and p-values from model simplification.

GLMM: Day * mean Elo-rating, X2 = 2.658, p = 0.103
GLMM: Day, X2 = 0.857, p = 0.355
128 - why was adlib sampling used instead of continuous scan sampling of
all occurrences of particular behaviors in each section of the pen? See
Altmann 1974 for details
(http://www.uwyo.edu/animalcognition/altmann1974.pdf).
We agree that we need to elaborate on this point and thank you for highlighting
the Altmann (1974) reference. When recording the aggression data, we watched
all birds continuously for a set amount of time and recorded all occurrences of
aggression (ad lib). According to Altmann (1974), ad lib sampling is
recommended for rare and significant events, such as aggressive interactions.
Whereas, scan sampling is recommended for calculating percentage of time
spent doing ‘state’ behaviours. Aggressive interactions are ‘events’ rather than
‘states’. We have clarified this in the manuscript, lines 141-142 now read “This
method of sampling is suitable to capture event behaviours, such as aggressive
interactions (Altmann 1974).”
130 - how were observations communicated? It seems that if the observers
were visually isolated, then they were trying to hide their presence from
the birds, but communicating vocally would draw attention to the
observers. Was inter-rater reliability calculated? If not, and if it is possible
because recordings were taken, please conduct this analysis.
We failed to make this clear in the manuscript. We were in communication via
two-way radio. Line 144 now reads “…via two-way radio…”
We are unable to conduct inter-rater reliability as observers did not record
behaviour on the same areas of the pen at the same time. However, all observers
were trained and experienced in recognising aggressive interactions, which are
highly conspicuous behaviours. Furthermore, observers rotated which areas of
the pen they were watching over sessions which reduced any bias in the data.
132 - how many “remaining days” were there?
Line 146 now reads “…on the remaining seven days…”
134 - why is this period unreliable? Is it just unreliable for the model? Or
had the birds just been introduced in the aviary and so were getting to
know each other?
Thank you for this query as it caused us to reconsider our use of the burn-in
period. We decided that including this period in the social rank data is not
necessary for our study. The burn-in period refers to a period in which ranks
associated with individuals may not be reflective of actual social ranks and this
may be a problem when considering rank trajectories, rank changes and/or
focusing on Elo-ratings on particular days. For our analysis on social rank and
learning performance, we considered a mean Elo-rating, calculated from 1000
Elo-ratings per individual, generated from randomizations of the whole dataset.
We therefore think this method will be robust against this uncertainty during
early interactions and so we have decided to consider all interactions, inclusive
of the early rankings. Therefore we have removed this from the MS and re-
analysed our data. After not including the burn-in period, mean Elo-ratings in the
new MS differ slightly and as a consequence one variable in the model
(performance on first choice) that was not significant, is now significant in
predicting success on the task. We have updated the manuscript accordingly.
- List the date range for data collection for social rank and spatial
navigation.
Line 110 now reads “From the 9th-13th April 2015”
Line 140 now reads “From the 20th-28th May 2015,”
Deleted “eight” from line 140 as this is now redundant information.
153 - change “halve” to “half”
Line 172 now reads “…ranks for each half…”
153 - why did you split the dataset and calculate a Spearman’s rank
correlation when you only used the mean for the full dataset?
We followed methods described by Sanchez et al. 2017 in which the purposes of
splitting the data was to assess uncertainty in estimating a reliable hierarchy. We
computed randomized Elo-ratings for each half of the interaction data and then
calculated Spearman’s rank correlation between the Elo-ratings from each half,
for each randomization. The aniDom package in R has a function that produces
the mean rs and 95% range confidence intervals of the correlation values. Our
results indicated both halves were strongly correlated, therefore we could be
confident that we collected an adequate amount of interactions to infer the
hierarchy reliably. We then took the mean of 1000 Elo-ratings (generated by
randomizations of the full dataset), as the most informative measure to use in
subsequent analysis. To make this clearer we have reworded lines 170– 175
“;secondly, we split the interaction dataset into two halves, computed 1000
individual ranks for each half using the randomized Elo-rating method and
calculated the Spearman’s Rank Correlation rS between the ratings generated by
the two halves. We report the mean rS and 95% confidence interval range of the
correlation values. These results indicated low levels of uncertainty in the data,
therefore we used the mean of the randomized Elo-ratings from the full dataset in
subsequent analyses, hereby referred to as ‘mean Elo-rating’.”
156 - what does it mean to “determine that t1 was repeatable”? t1 is the
latency to start the test? Repeatable within individuals? If so, explain why it
matters to your question.
We agree, our description here is vague and have elaborated on why we included
the repeatability analysis. Lines 175-182 now read “We used the rptR package
(Schielzeth et al., 2016) to assess whether males were repeatable in the time they
took to engage in the task (t1). If individuals are consistent in the time taken to
begin the task over multiple presentations, we can conclude that this assay of their
motivation provides a meaningful measure. Individuals exhibited a significant level
of repeatability (R = 0.231 ± 104, p = 0.005). Therefore mean t1, which was log-
transformed to normalise the distribution, was used in subsequent analyses. The
inclusion of mean t1 rather than t1 per trial also reduced the complexity of the
subsequent model, which was necessary given the sample size.”
160 - fully explain the binary variable: Correct (1) or Incorrect (0); and
state what t1 is so people can remember without needing to read above.
Line 184-186 now read “…’Correct’ (1 yes / 0 no) as the response variable, and
trial, mean Elo-rating, first trial correct (1 yes / 0 no) and mean time taken to
begin the task (log mean t1), as…”
162 - I don’t understand what this sentence means: “This model was fitted
on 13 trials, after the first trial was removed and included as an
explanatory variable”. Why did you remove the first trial? Was the first
trial the only trial in the “trial” explanatory variable in your model?
Please see response below.
164 - however, subjects learn from their first trials, therefore it is
important to include these with the rest of the trials to get a better idea of
how each individual learned. For example, one of my birds was learning to
associate color with a reward and in his first trial he chose incorrectly, but
then chose correctly every trial thereafter. If I didn’t have his first trial
performance in the dataset I wouldn’t have understood how he learned or
what learning strategy he was using.
In response to both of these comments, we removed the first trial performance
(correct 1 yes / 0 no) and inserted this as a predictor variable in the model
rather than keeping it with the other trials in the response variable for two
reasons. Firstly, during the first trial, individuals are unaware of which tunnel is
the correct as they have no experience with the testing chamber or procedures
and are behaving at random. Therefore, we would not expect social rank to be
related to how individuals behave at random. Secondly, after the first trial,
individuals now have information from the task, such as which tunnel leads them
out of the chamber (i.e. the reward), and only now is there opportunity for
learning. By including first trial performance as a predictor variable in the model,
we still think you can glean that information about how individuals are learning
but we agree that our explanation needs to be made more explicit and lines 188-
187-188 now read “…after performance on the first trial was removed from the
Correct variable and included as a separate explanatory variable”
Line 190-191 now reads “We included the first trial performance as an
explanatory variable because the outcome of this trial was prior to the opportunity
for learning but may affect subsequent performance on the task.”
165 - did you have convergence problems? If so, state it so it is clearer that
the conversion to z scores occurred after you started analysing your data.
This was not explained clearly, we have now amended lines 192-194 “The initial
model failed to converge, this was resolved by standardizing mean Elo-ratings and
trial by converting them to z scores (Gelman & Hill 2007).”
168 - please show the model output for the full model (not the minimum
adequate model) in a table somewhere so people can see the results for all
of the variables.
We agree that the full model is of interest so we have provided this in the data
depository. Line 198 now reads “Results from the full model are provided here
(doi ref).”
173 - write out each of these models here as you did above.
Lines 201-209 now read: “To ensure that we were capturing variation in cognitive
performance rather than other factors, we attempted to fit subsequent GLMMs
using a binomial error structure and logit link function. Firstly, we fitted a model to
check whether individuals of varying rank differed in their motivation to
participate, with Correct (yes 1, no 0) as the response variable and an interaction
term between mean Elo-ratings with time to begin the task (log mean t1) as
explanatory variables. Second, we fitted a model to check there were no rank-
related biases; individuals of higher rank were more likely than lower ranking
individuals to choose correctly on the first trial, with Correct as the response
variable and an interaction term between mean Elo-ratings and first trial
performance (Correct 1 yes / 0 no).”
179 - please write out the model structures for your binary logistic
regression models
Please see response below.
180 - how were learning curve coefficients generated or what were the
learning curve coefficients? Please show the outputs from these models
somewhere.
In answer to both these comments, lines 210-213 now read “…and used binary
logistic regression models, fitted with a binomial error structure and logit link
function with Correct (1 yes / 0 no) as the response variable and trial as an
explanatory variable to generate learning curve coefficients. The model outputs are
provided here (doi ref).”
- I still don’t know what an Elo-rating is so please explain it earlier in the
paper.
We apologise for not outlining this explicitly, we think it sounds suitable to
introduce Elo-ratings at lines 146-156 “To generate the social ranks we used an
extension of the Elo-rating method. In the original Elo-rating method, individuals
begin with the same start rating and this value is updated after each agonistic
interaction (Albers & de Vries, 2001; Neumann et al., 2011). The value each rating
is updated by is dependent on the outcome of the interaction (won or lost) and the
probability of that outcome occurring, relevant to both individuals’ current Elo-
rating. From these ratings individuals are organised into a hierarchy, allowing one
to conduct parametric statistics if necessary because individuals’ social ranks are
associated with a continuous variable. The Randomized Elo-rating method
(Sánchez-Tójar et al., 2017) then allows one to assess whether an adequate number
of interactions were recorded to infer a social hierarchy and quantify uncertainty
in the inferred hierarchy from the generation on randomized interaction data.”
187 - what does the mean correlation coefficient tell us? And why was this
the split interaction data when your methods suggest that you used the
mean Elo-rating from the overall dataset?
Please see response above regarding the calculation of the mean Spearman’s
rank correlation coefficient that we used to check reliability in our observations
of the hierarchy. We hope that this is now clearer in the manuscript, following
additional information in the methods (lines 170-175).
195 - what is a GzLMM? I’m only familiar with at GLMM, which is what it
looks like you used. Explain the acronym in the methods above.
In some cases, GzLMM is used but we agree that GLMM is more common. We
have updated these lines to read “GLMM”. We have also added this acronym the
first time we mention generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) in the methods.
- what was the range of percentages of correct choices per bird across all
trials?
We have added a line at the beginning of the spatial learning results: “The
percentage of correct choices per individual on the 13 trials ranged from 21-100%
correct”
Discussion
209 - replace “not more pronounced” with something more descriptive like
“individuals that chose correctly on their first trial did not perform better
overall”
Lines 245-246 now read “… but individuals that chose correctly on their first trial
had better performance overall.”
212 - “pre-existing biases” for what? Location?
Line 249 now reads “…or pre-existing bias for a location,…”
213 - since your prediction was the same using your measure of social rank
as it would have been using other measures of social rank (lines 90-94),
and because you didn’t compare methods of social rank measures against
each other, you can’t tell whether your measure is better than the others or
more accurate because you measured a large group. The positive
correlation between spatial navigation performance and dominance rank
was clearly shown, but I don’t think you can say anything about your
measure of rank specifically.
Please see response below.
214 - define “complex” in “complex social systems” and explain what your
results contribute to the broader view.
In answer to both of these comments: we do not wish to state that our method is
better, as you are correct, we have not explicitly compared methods. It is useful
to compare dominant and subordinate individuals, but in nature, individuals are
rarely just one or the other; they have multiple relationships with multiple
individuals (i.e. complex). We are merely indicating that the study of a multi-
individual social hierarchy adds another layer to our understanding of how these
relationships are associated with individual cognitive performance (broader
view). In a similar manner that network analysis is a powerful tool for studying
the structure of social systems (Lusseau et al. 2008), studying the social order
that emerges from a series of social interactions between dyads, provides us
with extra information on how cognitive performances vary across this social
landscape. For clarification, lines 249 – 251 now read “By considering the social
hierarchy of a large group, these findings provide us with a broader view on how
cognitive performances correspond to complex social systems, in which individuals
have multiple relationships.“
242-243 - I think there is a distinction between motivation and reward that
is a bit confounded here. You measured motivation as start time latency,
which might be distinct from the reward type: males that had females to
return to received a larger reward for choosing the correct tube. To assess
whether these are different would require an analysis to determine
whether males that had females were better learners and not necessarily
faster to start participating in the task. I’m not suggesting you HARK
(hypothesising after results are known), only that you consider mentioning
an additional alternative hypothesis.
This is a really interesting possibility and is a point we were attempting to get
across. When we were referring to ‘motivation’ we were not referring to our
measure of motivation, which was time taken to begin the task (t1), but yes,
reward motivation, as you state, which may differ between males because of
their varying access to females, and this may or may not be related to motivation
to begin the task. We assume that the higher ranking males have
preferential/less contested access to females in the pen (as previous work has
shown females prefer dominant males, Mateos & Carranza 1995). As we did not
measure male-female associations/mate guarding, this is not something we can
test explicitly, but this paragraph is discussing one of the possible
mechanisms/differences between males of different rank, and how this could be
related to differences in performance on the task. The line regarding our
motivation measure has been deleted and we have re-worded this paragraph in a
hope to make this clearer. Lines 280-286 now read “Individuals may have differed
in their motivation to leave the testing chamber (e.g. access to females). We assume
that higher ranking males may have had less contested access to females in the
communal pen, as females have been found to prefer dominant males (C Mateos &
Carranza, 1995). Although this is not something that we quantified, it is possible
that higher ranking males habitually guarded females in the communal pen,
causing them to be more motivated to choose the correct tunnel. Additionally, low
ranking males may have been less motivated to return to the communal pen where
they could be subject to aggression”
261 - why do you think lower ranking males suffer acute stress? Is there a
citation that give an indication of this?
Thank you for highlighting this, the comment you refer to was an extension of
the reference in the sentence above. We have amended this paragraph to make
that continuation clearer. Lines 301-303 now read “It is likely that the lower
ranking pheasants were in receipt of a higher level of aggression from conspecifics
than higher ranking males (Mateos & Carranza 1997) and consequently their
performance on the task may have been impaired.”
Data Accessibility
The data would be much more accessible if it was deposited in a data
repository (e.g., https://knb.ecoinformatics.org), which is searchable. If it
is just in supplementary material it gets lost because search engines don’t
pick this up. It’s up to you, I just thought I would point this out.
Great, thanks for the suggestion. The research data supporting this publication
are openly available from the University of Exeter's institutional repository at
https://doi.org/10.24378/XXXXXX; we are awaiting the final doi from IT and can
add that as soon as it becomes available.
Figure Legends
301 - what does scaled mean for trial and Elo-ratings?
We had used different terminology, we have amended this to read “…(mean Elo-
ratings z score) and trial (z-score)…”
304 - if there were no markings in the main chamber, then remove them
from the figure so you don’t have to explain them. Also, you say that you
placed them on the starting point so it is actually a real place and not just
for description?
We agree, this was confusing, the figure is self-explanatory. The legend has been
changed to “Aerial view of the left-right tunnel task testing arena”
Table 2 - Wald and p-values given at the point they were removed from the
model - I’m not aware of this being standard practice. From what I’ve read,
you take the output from the model with the final variables that are in your
reduced model and report these.
We agree that this is confusing and poorly written. We meant that the Wald
statistic and p value are from the comparison of the model including an
explanatory variable, compared to a model with this explanatory variable
removed. We have deleted this sentence and your comment urged us to
elaborate on this in the methods, lines 196-197 now read “The minimum
adequate model was reached by comparing models based on log likelihood using
backward stepwise deletion of non-significant variables.”
Figure 2 - can you make the confidence intervals (if that is what they are -
please define in the legend) for each group (H, M, L) distinct in color so they
are easier to distinguish?
Great idea. We have added colour to figure 2 and agree this makes it easier to
distinguish between the groups. We have also added a line at the end of the
legend that reads: “The shaded areas indicate 95% confidence intervals for each
curve.”
CSV files - please explain somewhere what each of your column titles
means and, if appropriate, what units they are in.
We have included a word document with a description of each of the files that
have been uploaded onto the ORE data depository.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
1. The authors should provide some actual data (tables/figures) of
performance on the spatial learning task and how it differs between
dominant and subordinate individuals. it would be interesting to see the
magnitude of differences.
We feel that this data is represented in Table 2 and Figure 2, which shows the
effect size of social rank on learning performance and the figure depicts nicely
the confidence intervals, steepness of the curves and differences in the curves for
three levels of the hierarchy.
2. The experiments were done with one group of individuals - how was this
corrected for in the statistical analysis?
We agree that data on one group may not be generalizable to other pheasant
hierarchies, or other taxa. Previous studies have shown these effects can differ
between groups (Boogert et al. 2006). However, 4 of 6 correlations that were
conducted in Boogert et al. (2006) did report a positive relationship between a
measure of social rank and learning performance. Taken together with our
findings we suggest that the relationship between social rank and learning
performance is a more general phenomena and not an artefact of our single
group of pheasants. We are unsure how to correct for this statistically and would
welcome any suggestions.
3. Do the authors have any other physiological or behavioural data
regarding dominance rank. Were all/any of the individuals in a breeding
state? The experimental procedures elicited a certain level of stress which
could differ between individuals.
Unfortunately, we do not have physiological data or other behavioural data
(besides the data on dominance interactions that we could include). We admit
this would be an interesting avenue to explore, as the potential mechanism
behind the relationship we observe could be related to hormonal
differences/difference in condition, between individuals of different rank. Also,
we do not make any predictions based on physiological or behavioural
differences between individuals of different rank, nor how this may result in a
difference in learning performance so we do not think it is necessary to include
here, it is however a great idea for future work.
The study was conducted during breeding season and we hope this comment has
been appeased following amendments made following the editors comments see
line 86: “…during breeding season.”.
This is a good point re: potential stress during testing, please see response to the
editor’s comment, lines 122-124.
Reviewer: 2
Main comments:
1.
The discussion gives a broad range of alternative explanations for the
results, however it neglects to mention social influences as a strategy. I
wonder if lower ranking individuals performed more poorly at this task
because they usually rely more on social information than higher-ranked
individuals do?
This is an interesting point, as previous work has demonstrated how individuals
of different social rank may differ in their tendency to learn socially. For
example, subordinate individuals have been found to be more reliant on social
information (‘copy if dominant’, Laland 2004). It may be that without social
information during our testing paradigm, lower ranking individuals performed
poorly as consequence. Although we do discuss mechanisms/alternative ideas
behind the relationship we observe, those ideas are purely in relation to
individual asocial learning. This is an interesting comment for extending our
future work.
2.
In general the statistical methods and results are very clear. However, I
was surprised that you did not include an interaction term in your main
model between learning rate (i.e. trial) and rank. This would allow you to
know if individuals learn at different rates depending on rank, not just
whether they learn at all.
We agree with this comment and have added an interaction term between mean
Elo-rating and trial to test whether individuals differ in their speed of learning as
well as their accuracy in performance. Although it is a non-significant
interaction, we agree that it should be included and the following lines have been
changed:
Lines 188-189 now read “An interaction between mean Elo-rating and trial was
included to assess whether individuals of different social rank differ in their rate of
learning”
Lines 224-226 in the results now read “The interaction between social rank and
trial was not significant (Table 2, Fig. 2), indicating that individuals of different
social rank did not learn the spatial discrimination task at different rates.”
Line 242 in the discussion now reads ““Social rank was not related to the rate at
which males chose correctly, but males performances… ”
Line 308 now reads “…the accuracy but not the rate of individual learning…”:
3.
To further refine your conclusions, I wonder if you can make greater use of
your data. For example, if mate-guarding does not correlate with social
rank from your hierarchy, it may be possible to include this as an
explanatory term in your model (if the data is available) to further examine
this possible explanation for cognitive differences. You could also take
advantage of your study design to look at memory effects by comparing
between the two sets of trials. Do lower-ranked individuals show a smaller
improvement than higher-ranked individuals, for example.
Unfortunately, we do not have data on mate guarding. We assume that higher
ranking males also have [the least contested] access to females. In a pen of this
size it is very difficult to categorise/quantify which males are guarding which
females as females generally tend to go where they please. We agree this would
be interesting to explore but our data does not permit it. Also, we are unsure
what the a priori predictions would be and why mate guarding would be related
to learning performance? This is an interesting idea for future work but
unfortunately it is not something we can address here.
In response to the second point regarding memory v learning trials, we think this
is an interesting idea and did run a separate analysis to investigate this further.
Please see comments to the editor for results. However, we are concerned it
would change the scope of the manuscript considerably but is definitely
something to consider for future work.
Specific comments:
line 75: this information about variation in spatial memory and territorial
or floater males led me to expect this to be a part of your study. Can you
indicate whether social rank correlated with mate-guarding, either in the
methods as part of your study design, or the results?
Please see response to comment above. As this study was focused on how intra-
sexual interactions relate to performance on a cognitive task, we have added a
line that reads “between males” on line 140 in the methods for clarity. We have
also emphasised that we did not collect data on mate guarding in the discussion.
line 92-93: assume that this should be “we predict that…”
Line 98 now reads “…we expect that…”
line 113: I’m assuming that this is from the 7-1 trials from the first day?
This could be clearer.
Please see response to a comment from the editor as this has been changed.
line 133-134: assume that this is first 100 interactions observed of the
group, rather than for each individual!
Please see response to the editor as this has now been removed from the
manuscript.
line 153: each half
Line 171 now reads “…each half…”
line 173: did you consider including an interaction between trial and rank?
This would help to tease apart whether individuals of different rank learn
more quickly than others.
Please see response above.
line 194-195: this is a little strong to say that there was no effect, given that
p = 0.064. What is the direction of this, marginally non-significant, trend?
Following re-analysis of the social ranks, performance on first trial is now
significant. We then checked the paragraph of the discussion in which we
interpret these results but as we were discussing whether the first trial
performance is related to social rank and it is not, the conclusions in this
paragraph can remain as they are.
line 221: this is not a criticism of your study, as I completely agree with you
that testing rank and cognition across an ecologically-relevant group size is
necessary; however, here it would be nice if you could be more explicit
about what this extra information has provided us. For example, here you
state at the beginning of the paragraph that studies on dyads or small
groups also found positive correlations between rank and learning, but
then you finish by stating that these kinds of tests might not be
representative of natural situations. As you found similar results, then this
doesn’t really follow!
Please see comment above to the editor about how our study contributes to a
broader view which further elaborates our argument. But you are correct it
sounds like we are disagreeing with those previous studies on dyads. This is not
the case, we instead want to emphasise that we are lacking information on those
middle ranks as these studies only inform us of what occurs when individuals
are solely dominant or solely subordinate. We have has reworded the closing
line of this paragraph for clarity: “Therefore, these social ranks and their cognitive
performances may not be fully representative of how this relationship manifests in
natural situations.”
line 230: were is italicised
This has been addressed.
line 242: apologies, I might have missed this, but did social rank correlate
with mate-guarding in your group? If not, then could you include mate-
guarding as a variable in the model to get at this potential explanation? i.e.
which predicts cognitive performance most, mate-guarding or social rank?
Please see response above.
line 257: could you use your two sets of 7 trials to examine this? an
interaction term between trial and rank, or day & rank, perhaps, might
allow you to see if there is any indication of differences in memory across
the test.
Please see response above.
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
Most of my comments relate to how and when the dominance data were
collected; as the authors note, the pheasants’ hierarchies are stable for
short periods and are particularly flexible at the start of the breeding
season, and yet from the manuscript it is unclear when the cognitive or
behavioural data were collected (and critically, in relation to one another).
Please see response to the editor, dates have now been provided in the
manuscript. Due to reviewers comments we have decided to remove the word
‘stable’ from the manuscript when describing our inferred hierarchy as we
cannot conclusively make this claim. However, we still think it is very interesting
that this relationship exists, even when social rank was measured later than
performance on the cognitive task. In answer to your query more specifically, we
have included clarification on lines 156-159 “Due to separate experiments, there
was a gap of approximately 5 weeks between cognitive testing and recording of
dominance observations, but based on previous work (Mateos & Carranza 1999)
we expect the social hierarchy remained relatively stable within the breeding
season.”
Some additional details are also needed when describing the observational
methods, specifically in relation to how, or whether, inter-observer
reliability was established when recording the agonistic interactions that
were used to assess dominance.
Please see response to the editor.
L79: Including the months of the breeding season would be useful here,
particularly as the learning data seems to have been collected around that
time.
Please see response to the editor.
L92: Appears to be missing a word
Line 98 now reads “...then we expect that…”
L97: How long were the birds housed before testing began?
We hope this is now clearer as exact dates have been added to the manuscript.
L98: How were subjects identified? Rings?
We have added this information on lines 106-107 “Individuals were identifiable
by numbered patagial wing tags”.
L102: The dates of testing would be useful here.
Line 110 now reads “From the 9th-13th April 2015”
L108: Length of the tunnel?
Line 116 now reads “…(H 20cm, W 28cm, D60cm)…”
L118: Did the birds have experience with this new chamber before testing?
We’ve inserted a sentence to address this: “This chamber was novel to all
individuals.”
L133: Others (eg Newton-Fisher 2017) have noted that the burn-in period
is variable depending on the data. Some rationale for why 100
observations were chosen is needed here.
Please see comments to the editor, we have now removed this from the
manuscript.
L128: How soon after testing was the dominance data collected?
We hope this is now clearer as exact dates have been added to the manuscript.
L132: Some more details on the observations would be useful here. For
example did you only record events with a clear outcome (winner, loser)?
How was interobserver reliability established beforehand? Were
observations video recorded and later coded for reliability?
We agree this needs to be made clearer, please see above comments to the editor
regrading additional information on Elo-ratings that has been added and for
clarity, lines 142-143 now read “Interactions had a clear winner and loser.”
L141: Was there any reason observational data wasn’t collected both
before and after testing? It seems that this would have created a more
accurate picture of the hierarchy at the time of testing.
It would have been ideal to collect dominance data at both times, as we are
unable to say whether the hierarchy altered between cognitive testing and
collection of dominance data. However, due to logistical reasons and other data
collection, this was not feasible. Due to reviewers comments we have decided to
remove the word ‘stable’ from the manuscript when describing our inferred
hierarchy as we cannot conclusively make this claim. However, we still think it is
very interesting that this relationship exists, even when social rank was
measured later than performance on the cognitive task.
L222: This sentence could use a bit more explanation.
Please see response to the editor in which we offer further justification for this
paragraph and response to reviewer 2 in which amend this paragraph.
Other changes
We have changed ‘Elo-ratings’ to ‘Elo-rating’ to remain consistent throughout the
manuscript.
Appendix B
XX January 2018
Dear Dr Logan,
We thank you and reviewer 3 again for your comments and help with improving the
manuscript. Below, we detail our specific responses to the new points raised and
changes we have made to the manuscript.
Please note that the url for the data supporting the manuscript has now been made
available and is included in ‘Data Accessibility’ section. We have also highlighted in the
manuscript on lines 204 and 219 when referencing specific model outputs. Is this
appropriate?
We are pleased to resubmit this revised version and look forward to hearing your
decisions.
Yours sincerely,
Ellis Langley, Jayden van Horik, Mark Whiteside and Joah Madden
Editor’s comments
Line 18 - Change “mixed sex group with an established hierarchy” to “mixed sex
group with a linear hierarchy”
Line 18 has been amended.
Line 47 - Change “the opposite relationship between social rank and learning has
been reported” to “results have been found that are contrary to the prediction
that the more dominant individuals would be better learners”
Lines 47-48 have been amended.
Line 52 - It isn’t clear how your example of reversal learning and inhibitory
control tasks relates to subordinates being better learners. Please clarify.
Line 49 has been amended to: “Subordinate individuals outperformed dominant
individuals by making fewer errors on complex problem solving (…”
>This needs to be made clearer and we should not assume that readers know the
methods. We have amended this sentence, lines 55-58 now read ”Alternatively,
the relationship between cognitive performance and social rank may have been
confounded by the removal of specific individuals for approximately one month,
over a 3 month period; thus the experimentally induced instabilities in social
structure may have confounded the results (Bunnell & Perkins 1980).”
Current version: lines 55-59 - I still find this unclear. This paragraph seems to
discuss relationships in a broad sense, but your new sentence appears to be about
a particular study. It is unclear which individuals were removed or what one
month has to do with anything. Are you referring to something that occurred in
Bunnell & Perkins’ study specifically? If so, please give more details about how
removing subjects from a group in their study can have implications more
generally that can potentially confound social rank stability.
We were referring to the Bunnell papers specifically because as yet, these are the only
examples we have of a hierarchy in a large group and its relation to cognitive
performances. They report a relationship in the opposite direction from what is
expected/has been shown with other methodologies, which is either because: 1) they
focused on reversal learning or 2) because the group composition fluctuated during the
studies. We have reworded lines 56-61 in the hope to clarify, “Alternatively, the
relationship between cognitive performance and social rank reported in the Bunnell et al.’s
studies may have been complicated by the experimentally induced instabilities in social
structure. Individuals were continually removed and re-introduced to the social group
during the study period, therefore increasing social pressure for dominants who were
attempting to maintain their rank (Bunnell et al. 1980), thus confounding the relationship
between social rank and cognitive performance.”
Line 90 - One minor clarification here to indicate that the first part of the sentence
refers to the breeding season. Change
“We expect that measures of social rank are more meaningful while competition
for resources is intense, ”
to
“We expect that measures of social rank are more meaningful during the breeding
season when competition for resources is more intense, ”
if the latter is accurate.
Yes, the latter is accurate, line 91 has been amended.
Line 114 - Change “…due to their participation in a separate experiment and we
expected that their performance on the task would be affected” to “…because we
expected their participation in a different experiment to influence their
performance on this task”
Lines 115-116 have been amended.
Line 118 - “Line 116 now reads “…(H 20cm, W 28cm, D 60cm),…” I still find this
confusing because I’m picturing the tunnel as a circular tube, which would have a
diameter and length rather than a height, width, and depth. From your
dimensions, it is more likely that the tunnel shape is rectangular. Please indicate
what shape the tunnel is in the manuscript.
We agree this is confusing, the entrance to the tunnel is an arch and we have provided
measurements for the highest and widest parts, as well as the length for the tunnel
(which we had called depth). We have amended line 120 to: “…(arch shaped; H 20cm, W
28cm, L 60cm)…”
Line 145 - Refer to your ethogram in Table 1.
Apologies, we are unsure on this particular comment. We refer to the ethogram on line
144, would you prefer this to be moved?
Line 149 - you say you use an “extension” of the elo-rating method and you
describe the original method, but I can’t find information on how you extended it.
Please clarify.
Lines 157-158 now read, “…The extension of this method; the Randomized Elo-rating
method (Sánchez-Tójar et al., 2017), then allows one to assess…”
Line 158 - Change “due to separate experiments” to “due to the subjects
participating in other experiments”
Lines 160-161 have been amended.
Line 181 - “If individuals are consistent in the time taken to begin the task over
multiple presentations, we can conclude that this assay of their motivation
provides a meaningful measure”
A meaningful measure of motivation? If so, I suggest rewording to
“If individuals are consistent in the time taken to begin the task over multiple
presentations, we can conclude that this assay is a meaningful measure of their
motivation”
Lines 182-183 have been amended.
Line 182 - “R=0.231 +/- 104”. Do you mean +/- 0.104?
Yes, amended.
Line 185 - “which was necessary given the sample size” Necessary given the small
or large sample size?
Line 187 has been changed to: “…small sample size.”
Line 284 - Change “(e.g. access to females)” to “(e.g. whether they have
preferential access to females)”
Line 294 has been amended.
Line 304 - “It is likely that the lower ranking pheasants were in receipt of a higher
level of aggression from conspecifics than higher ranking males” Can you test this
with your data? If so, you could add the results of a posthoc analysis to provide
some information about whether this would be a fruitful avenue for future
research to pursue.
We agree that this is interesting, however we are not keen not to include the extra
analysis in this manuscript as these data analyses are included in another thesis
chapter/potential paper. In the other study we explore the various potential
mechanisms for the relationship between social rank and cognitive performance and we
hope you appreciate our desire to keep them separate.
Table 2 - change “predictor variable” (the row just above Intercept) to
“explanatory variable” to be consistent with the terms you use in the methods.
This has been changed.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have adequately addressed all of my comments and I am happy with
the changes. Some minor comments: as the authors note in their response, it is
difficult to know whether the dominance data accurately represent the hierarchy
at the time of testing; and while I agree that the relationship between the two
variables is interesting regardless, this could be mentioned a bit more explicitly in
the discussion. Normally, the reference to Matheos and Carranza would be
convincing enough, but as far as I can tell (although I could have missed
something), it doesn’t really provide any actual data saying that the hierarchies
are stable over 3 months, only that they chose to sample periodically like this as
the hierarchies are known to change. If that is the case and that was the whole
basis for assuming the hierarchy didn’t change, then I think it’s at least worth
mentioning as a question mark in the discussion. Are there any other references
that can be used to strengthen this argument?
We agree that this should be highlighted in the discussion. We have incorporated this on
lines 270-277: “It is possible that the social hierarchy we inferred from the dominance
observations had changed since the cognitive testing was conducted. However, previous
work on pheasants shows that when group composition is held constant, hierarchies
become well established (C. Mateos & Carranza, 1997b; Mateos, 2005), and although
Mateos et al. do not comment explicitly on the duration of hierarchy stability, other
galliformes demonstrate stable hierarchies when housed over similar periods to our study
(up to 20 weeks in domestic chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus, Rushen, 1982; at least
three weeks in jungle fowl, Gallus gallus, Chappell, Zuk, & Johnsen, 1999).”
L233: The authors noted that first trial performance is now significant but line
233 seems to have the old stats.
Thank you for highlighting this, lines 235-239 now read: “Performance on the first trial
was a significant main effect in the model (GLMM: first trial, Wald X2 =4.956, p = 0.026);
males that chose correctly on their first trial were more likely to choose correctly on
subsequent trials (Table 2).”
