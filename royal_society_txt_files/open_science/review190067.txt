This paper might be seen as expanding Section 2.2 of Cox (1970, Binary Data, Chapman and
Hall); some other parts of the same chapter also seem relevant. I find it a bit surprising that this
book and the second edition with Snell (1989) are not cited, particularly as the authors of the
present work seem to contradict advice therein about the linear in probabilities model: `use of a
model, the nature of whose limitations can be foreseen, is not wise, except for very restricted
purposes' (Cox and Snell, 1989, page 14).
Apart from this, my comments are relatively minor:
page 1, line 59 (using the numbers at the left of the page): `interpretation is more formal'.
Meaning? And what are `the data on $Y_i$'? I thought the $y$s were the data. This entire
passage is obscure (including the bit about concentrated at the end of the scale---the scale is
$\pm$, so this presumably means the data are mostly -1s or 1s?)
page 2, line15-21: The second may also involve a small sample analysis, as in the more elaborate
but similar model discussed in Davison and Sartori (2008, Statistical Science).
page 2, line 44-45: simplify to ... tests may be based on ...
page 3, line 33: bracket trouble
page 3, lines 35-39: What's the evidence that OLS is less sensitive to bad data? Usually it is
regarded as the paradigm of a non-robust estimation procedure (though here this is mitigated by
the binary nature of the responses). The sensitivity alluded to might be regard as a strong
argument in favour of the logistic model ...
page 4, lines 28-38: Surely there are closed forms for these expressions, since the $\Phi$ parts can
be expressed as a conditional probability given the variable in the $\phi$ part, and the whole
reduces to a $\Phi$?
page 5, line 1: `explanatory observations'?
page 5, line 32: the final analysis results seem to be missing from Table 2. (Or, if not, to which line
do they correspond?) Generally there seems to be some confusion in the text about the contents
of this table (and its caption seems inadequate---what sort of estimates, for example?).
Table 2: could we see (and could you please briefly discuss) the results of a logistic regression
analysis, for comparison? If a linear Taylor series expansion around the MLEs of the probabilities
was used, would it lead to essentially the same conclusions? It would also be useful to be able to
compare the SEs for the ML, LS and logistic models.
What actually is the empirical value of the efficiency loss shown at page 3, line 33, in this
example?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
I leave it to others better qualified than me to comment on the formal statistical argument of this
paper. However I do have two observations relevant to its implications and application.
Binary response data is ubiquitous in the social sciences. Students and researchers are taught that
to fit a linear model is wrong because residuals cannot be normally distributed and estimates of
the response variable can be out of range. I plead guilty to being one of many authors to argue
this. Because of this, logistic regression has become a workhorse underpinning published
research across the social sciences. However, criticism of the linear model has not always been
accompanied by adequate appreciation of the difficulties of interpreting logistic coefficients
because of the way in which they are confounded with residual variation. This complicates the
comparison of coefficients across nested models of the same group of observations, or between
the same model applied to different groups, since coefficients will be biased towards zero but by
different amounts, since residual variation is unlikely to be constant across models, as the
references [1] [2] cited by the authors point out. Although this problem has been discussed in the
methodological literature for over twenty years, awareness of it among applied social scientists,
journal editors and referees has lagged behind.
In this context, the suggestion that a linear in probability model may sometimes be preferred to
the use of logistic transformation of the probabilities for binary response data has enormous
significance. The upshot of this paper is that the advice routinely given to students and
researchers in social statistics is at best incomplete, and in some circumstances simply wrong.
The authors may feel that it is not their job to translate the conclusions of their paper into advice
or guidance aimed at those unable to follow in full the presentation of their argument. It could
also be argued that any such advice carries the danger that it might, by encouraging researchers
to use a procedure they do not fully understand, support poor statistical work. However, I would
encourage the authors to consider setting out some of their conclusions in a form accessible to a
wider audience than it might currently reach. While they may feel that, for example, to compare
the results of the empirical analysis presented here with that produced by logistic regression
would be pedestrian, whereas I think it would help many readers to appreciate the way in which
4
the approach described here produces a set of coefficients that are less sensitive to patterns in
missingness and with much smaller standard errors than those produced by logistic
transformation. Doing so might help to spread awareness much more quickly beyond the
methodologists to those doing and refereeing applied work.
I suspect readers with a social science background will also find the interpretation of relations
concerning the observed proportion of outcomes surprising. Logistic regression coefficients are
typically interpreted in terms of the relative odds of a positive outcome. In the model presented
here, because it is the proportion of outcomes itself that is the dependent, the conclusion is
presented in terms ‘numbers of individuals potentially influenced by a unit change of an
explanatory variable’, that is, shifting from one category to another of the outcome variable. The
unit change in explanatory categorical variables is treated as a change in the characteristics of a
hypothetical population, such as a change in the proportion of sexes or ethnic groups. While this
is formally clear, its substantive interpretation is less obvious. Researchers may often be less
interested in comparing outcomes across differing hypothetical populations than in inferring the
relative odds of a positive outcome for different groups within them. It is not clear to me, and it
would be helpful if the authors discussed this more explicitly, whether such inferences would be
legitimate with this model. On page 2 the authors appear to continue to favour a logistic
approach here (‘testing the significance of individual effects’). However, in the discussion of the
interpretation of the explanatory variables, the example of family circumstances is treated in
terms of the relative probability of experiencing a positive outcome. This confusion is my
responsibility rather than that of the authors, but I suspect I would not be the only reader who
would benefit from a slightly longer exposition of this point.
One very minor point. The authors adequately describe the source of the data used in the
illustration and its subsequent treatment. However my understanding is that good
reproducibility practice would be to include an r script or other code of the model run and the
sensitivity analysis made.

The authors investigate advantages and disadvantages of a linear in probability model for the
analysis of binary data.
Discussions about advantages and disadvantages between the commonly used linear model in
the logistic transform of probabilities and a simpler linear in probability model are recurrent in
the literature of different fields. For instance, in the past decade there has been a heated debate in
the economic literature about this question and more broadly about the need to go beyond simple
linear models.
This is a refreshing paper and a useful guideline for statisticians and data analysts. A positive
aspect of this paper is a clear discussion of the properties of OLS and MLE for the linear in
probability model and the interpretation of the corresponding coefficients, as well as the
introduction of a simple tool for model checking.
I have just a question about the sensitivity of MLE versus OLS; see the comment in the middle of
p. 3. The sensitivity of the MLE is already apparent from the score function in the estimating
equation below formula (3) at p. 2. This function becomes very large for x's such that x^T\beta is
close to the boundary 1, making the influence function of the MLE unbounded. In the paper it is
stated that "OLS is by contrast relatively unaffected ..." (p. 3), but I do not see the reason. In fact its
score function will always be affected by large values of some covariates.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Professor Ruth King):
The paper has been reviewed by myself and three reviewers. Overall, the paper has been very
well written and presents an interesting discussion of the use of the linear model for binary data,
as opposed to the commonly used logistic regression model. There are a few minor issues which
would be useful to address, as identified by the reviewers, particularly in relation to the
comparison of the linear model with the logistic model in the example provided - see reviewers
comments for additional comments. Although the appendix provides a description of how to
access the data is it possible to obtain permission to be able to provide the data with the paper?
Finally, it would also be useful to provide an R script for reproducing the results of the paper
given the data.

Appendix A
Manuscript number RSOS-190067
We thank the associate editor and the three referees for their encouraging reports. The following
changes reflect their suggestions.
• We have slightly enlarged the first paragraph of page 2 to clarify when the linear logistic
model would be preferred to the linear in probability model and vice versa.
• Wording has been simplified in: the third paragraph of page 1; the final sentence of §2.1;
the second paragraph of §3.
• Table 1’s caption and title has been clarified.
• A brief discussion of the linear logistic model has been added at the end of §3.
The additional points seem not to need major changes to the paper.
• The fragility of maximum likelihood in the context of the linear in probability model is due
to the implicit restrictions on the parameter space. The empirical fitting by least squares
ignores these restrictions. By accepting the possibility of out of range fitted values, the
coefficient estimates are made less sensitive to aberrant observations. We feel that a more
formal analysis in terms of influence functions is unnecessary.
• Closed forms for the integrals on page 4 do not seem available. Good analytic approxima-
tions are provided in reference [5].
• A brief discussion of the linear logistic model has been added at the end of §3. We decided
not to include results of a logistic model as these would not be very enlightening. The
analysis has been performed and is available in the code, which we have deposited in your
data repository, along with the data used. Figure 1 summarizes the output of this analysis,
which is as expected.
