This paper presents an interesting piece of work dealing with the investigation of aldehydes and
ketones (AKs) in complex mixture by mass spectrometry using a derivatization step by the
Girard’s T reagent. This methodology is used to compare the AK composition of two different
cigarette smoke the MSS and the SSS. In spite of the interest of this work significant major
revision are required for different reasons.
The introduction requires to be improved and modified. It has to be more clearly focused on the
analysis of cigarette smoke by non-targeted mass spectrometry. Significant references are missing
as those of the Zimmerman group and those of other groups. In the last five years, a number of
papers reported the analysis of AKs in complex mixture by HR MS after a reduction or a

One important issue in this paper is the use of two HR MS instruments. The authors justified the
use of orbitrap according to the low mass cut-off of FT ICRMS which is too high to observe the
“naked” AKs. This is correct, but the orbitrap instrument has the capability to investigate both
the low mass and the high mass range. Moreover, authors observed on the orbitrap mass spectra

ion at higher m/z than on the FT ICR MS, this means that a part of the AKs, which are
derivatizated by Girard’s T reagent are not detected. Consequently, the assertion of the authors
concerning the same ionization efficiency for all compounds after reaction of AKs with Girard’s
reactant is totally wrong. The comparison of the DBE distribution for a given class compound (O1
for example) is significantly different why? This deserves to be deeper discuss. What about the
compounds which contain two or more carbonyl chemical groups?
One other important issue is relative to the detection NxOy compounds by ESI-FT ICR MS: how
are the author sure that these species are associated with derivatizated MSS/or SSS compounds.
A large part of cigarette smoke simultaneously contains nitrogen and oxygen see the paper
corresponding to ref 4 and the other papers of the same group. In the same way how are the
author sure that only AKs are present in the so-called AKs fraction? Without this confirmation
the obtained conclusions are highly disputable.

RSOS-181832 - review
n this manuscript the authors use a well-established technique for the, mainly, qualitative
nalysis of carbonyl compounds in cigarette smoke. They demonstrate that a good amount of
quantitative data can be gained this way on a complex mixture of related compounds. This
gives the work the value that warrants a publication of it.
The text is written in good English but it should be polished, in some places it is somewhat
bumpy or simply incorrect – one example (line 38 on page 2): “After reacted with the Girard
T reagent, the polarity of carbonyls produced quarternary ammonium salt derivatives is much
higher than other components in the neutral fraction and is easily separated.” It would be a
pity not to correct such expressions.
Some further questions that should be cleared up are:
Although the expression “Girard’s reagent” is known, it is my sense that “Girard reagent” is
much more common
What detector was used in gas chromatography? In the section “Instrument conditions” I
don’t find any explicit mentioning of this.
Why did the authors used both Orbitrap and FT-ICR MS? In the section mentioned above I
don’t see any rationale for this. If the reason was the better ion transmission for Orbitrap in
he lower molecular weight region, why then use FT-ICR at all? And is this assumption borne
out by the results (e.g. Figure 7)?
Quantification.
This is a mine field and it is simply impossible to deduce quantitative relationships from the
ignal heights for two compounds, as is done in GC. Despite this, the authors use a
quantitation for the Girard derivatives by postulating, without further justification, that since
hey all have the same permanent ionic structure, their “ionization efficiens are basically the
ame” (line 31, page 4). Is this assumption really true? Do the authors not neglect the
hydrophobicity effect, described by John Fenn himself, that is known to have a major effect
on the signal height in ESI-MS?
This effect has been described in the literature for compounds of a very similar kind to that
used here, namely in ref. 18 and also in DOI 10.1021/ef5028108 It was shown that
ompounds present in equimolar amounts easily gave MS signals that differed by a factor of
2.
There are also uncertainties growing out of the data presented by the authors. Take as an
xample figure 7. In the FT O1 Kendrick plot, the two largest dots are of approximately the
ame size. However, in the gas chromatogram, that of the open structure is ca twice as large
s that of the cyclohexeneone. In view of this, how do the authors justify quantifying based
only on MS signal heights?
Furthermore, how do the authors justify the abundance percentages for different compound
lasses (Figure 2, Figure 5) when knowing that N containing compounds usually have a much
higher ionization efficiency in ESI than other compounds, thus producing considerably higher
ignal heights for the same molar amounts?
The authors state on line 6, page 2: “The pre-charged property of Girard’s reagent can
enhance and uniform ionization efficiency of the derivatives in ESI-MS analysis.[36]”. I
certainly agree with the enhancement but the quoted sentence is not supported by the
eference indicated; this reference is mainly an overview of different reagents that have been
used for LC-MS, including carbonyl compounds.
Lines 33-35 on page 2: The first two sentences in this paragraph seem to be identical.
Table 1: Do the standard deviations justify four significant figures in the percentage
numbers?
Table 2: The first letter in the compound names should be either capitalized or not
capitalized throughout, not mixed
Misspelling of “7-methly-1-indanone”
“4,7,9-Megastigmatrien-3-one” – obviously there are several isomers, thus it would be
appropriate to indicate this here and on each line add “or isomer”. The same for “12-
sopropyl-1,5,9-trimethyl-4,8,13-cyclotetradecatriene-1,3-diol”
The compound at 16.98 minutes: There are two names here, please separate them, perhaps by
putting the long name in parenthesis. Please don’t use capital C in cyclohexen.
The compound at 5.86 min: The correct name according to CAS is 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-
cyclopenten-1-one.
Figure 1: In the first “round-bottom flask”, the amounts of the different compounds is given
but not that of the Girard reagent. Is that intentional?

In this manuscript the authors use a well-established technique for the, mainly,
qualitative analysis of carbonyl compounds in cigarette smoke. They
demonstrate that a good amount of quantitative data can be gained this way on
a complex mixture of related compounds. This gives the work the value that
warrants a publication of it.
We thank the reviewer for these comments.
The text is written in good English but it should be polished, in some places it
is somewhat bumpy or simply incorrect – one example (line 38 on page 2):
“After reacted with the Girard T reagent, the polarity of carbonyls produced
quarternary ammonium salt derivatives is much higher than other components
in the neutral fraction and is easily separated.” It would be a pity not to correct
such expressions.
Response: Thanks very much for your comments, which are very
helpful for us to improve the manuscript, and our language should be
improved. After carefully check, we found many grammar and sentence
errors, and have modified the manuscript. Furthermore, we have invited
several English teachers help correct grammar and sentences, and we
hope the revised paper will be more clear and accurate on expressions.
For example, the sentence have been revised to: “After reacted
with the Girard’s reagent T, the resulting aldehyde or ketone derivative
is very easy to separate. This is because the polarity of the quaternary
ammonium salt is much higher than the other components in the neutral
fraction.”
Some further questions that should be cleared up are:
- Although the expression “Girard’s reagent” is known, it is my sense that
“Girard reagent” is much more common
Response: Thanks for the comment. We have changed ‘Girard’s
reagent’ to ‘Girard reagent’ (but we retained the term “Girard’s reagent
T” according to other literature).
- What detector was used in gas chromatography? In the section “Instrument
conditions” I don’t find any explicit mentioning of this.
Response: We used mass spectrometry as the gas
chromatographic detector. We have add the following sentence in the
revised manuscript:
“The mass spectrometry (MS) was used as chromatographic
detector. The electron impact (EI) ionization source was operated
under 70 eV ionization energy. The MS ion source was at 230 °C. The
mass range was 35-420 m/z with a 0.5 s scan period.”
- Why did the authors used both Orbitrap and FT-ICR MS? In the section
mentioned above I don’t see any rationale for this. If the reason was the better
ion transmission for Orbitrap in the lower molecular weight region, why then
use FT-ICR at all? And is this assumption borne out by the results (e.g. Figure
7)?
Response: The Orbitrap MS has better ion transmission both in the
lower and higher molecular weight region, and it is suitable for the
analysis of original AKPs. The FT-ICR MS has higher resolution at high
molecular weight ends (i.e. at 400 m/z ) compared to Orbitrap MS, and
it is more suitable for the analysis of GirT derivatives.
In fact, we found that for cigarette samples, the resolution of the
Orbitrap MS on the high molecular weight ends is sufficient. But we
want to compare these two results, so we finally chose to list the results
obtained by the two mass spectrometers. We have added the following
sentence in the revised manuscript:
“To obtain a comprehensive result, the high resolution mass
spectrometry is used to analyze the sample. Comparing with the FT-
ICR MS, The Orbitrap MS has better ion transmission both in the lower
and higher molecular weight region. It’s considered that the FT-ICR MS
has higher resolution at high molecular weight region. Since the
molecular weight of original AKPs is much lower than the
corresponding GirT derivatives, the Orbitrap MS was selected to
analyse the original AKPs.”
- Quantification.
This is a mine field and it is simply impossible to deduce quantitative
relationships from the signal heights for two compounds, as is done in GC.
Despite this, the authors use a quantitation for the Girard derivatives by
postulating, without further justification, that since they all have the same
permanent ionic structure, their “ionization efficiens are basically the same”
(line 31, page 4). Is this assumption really true? Do the authors not neglect the
hydrophobicity effect, described by John Fenn himself, that is known to have
a major effect on the signal height in ESI-MS?
This effect has been described in the literature for compounds of a very similar
kind to that used here, namely in ref. 18 and also in DOI 10.1021/ef5028108
It was shown that compounds present in equimolar amounts easily gave MS
signals that differed by a factor of 2.
There are also uncertainties growing out of the data presented by the authors.
Take as an example figure 7. In the FT O1 Kendrick plot, the two largest dots
are of approximately the same size. However, in the gas chromatogram, that
of the open structure is ca twice as large as that of the cyclohexeneone. In view
of this, how do the authors justify quantifying based only on MS signal heights?
Response: We are sorry that we have made a mistake. We did not
fully considered the hydrophobicity effect to ionization efficiency. Our
expression “Since the highly conversion of AKs reaction with Girard’s
reagent, and the ionized groups after derivatization are all quaternary
ammonium groups (the ionization efficiencies are basically the same)”
is totally wrong. We have removed this sentence in the revised
manuscript. The related content has also been modified accordingly.
Furthermore, we have removed and revised other statements about
‘justify quantifying based only on MS signal heights’ in the revised
manuscript.
Furthermore, how do the authors justify the abundance percentages for
different compound classes (Figure 2, Figure 5) when knowing that N
containing compounds usually have a much higher ionization efficiency in ESI
than other compounds, thus producing considerably higher signal heights for
the same molar amounts?
Response: We are sorry that we have caused a misunderstanding.
The data shown in Figure 2 and Figure 5 are the summed mass
spectrometric intensities but do not quantitatively reflect the abundance
of species in the sample. We have added the following sentence in the
revised manuscript:
“The relative abundance of each class and type (DBE) is
calculated and shown in Figure 2(b). Relative abundance is defined as
the magnitude of each peak divided by the sum of the magnitudes of
all identified peaks (exclude the isotopic peaks) in the MS spectrum.
The data shown in Figure 2 are the summed mass spectrometric
intensities but do not quantitatively reflect the abundance of species in
the sample. The O1 class AKPs with the most relative abundance in
MSS and SSS, followed by the O2, O3, and O4 class. Compared to SSS,
the MSS with a little higher relative abundance of high oxygenate. This
result is consistent with the elemental analysis result in Table 1.”
The authors state on line 6, page 2: “The pre-charged property of Girard’s
reagent can enhance and uniform ionization efficiency of the derivatives in
ESI-MS analysis.[36]”. I certainly agree with the enhancement but the quoted
sentence is not supported by the reference indicated; this reference is mainly
an overview of different reagents that have been used for LC-MS, including
carbonyl compounds.
Response: According to your suggestion, we have revised the text:
“The pre-charged property of Girard’s reagent can enhance the
ionization efficiency of the derivatives in ESI-MS analysis.[36]”
- Lines 33-35 on page 2: The first two sentences in this paragraph seem to be
identical.
Response: According to your suggestion, we have revised the text.
- Table 1: Do the standard deviations justify four significant figures in the
percentage numbers?
Response: The elemental analysis was performed at EL cube CHN
and papid OXY cube (Elementar, Germany) by a dedicated laboratory
technician at the State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, China
University of Petroleum (Beijing). The accuracy and repeatability of
elemental analysis is recognized to be very high, and the general
results of elemental analysis are four significant figures. In this study,
the elemental analysis result is the average of three measurements,
and the standard deviations justify four significant figures.
We have added the following sentence in the revised manuscript:
“The elemental analysis was performed at EL cube CHN papid
OXY cube (Elementar, Germany). Carbon and hydrogen content
measurement was according to the ASTM D5291-2002 method; sulfur
was according to the ASTM D5453-2004; oxygen was according to the

2002.”
- Table 2: The first letter in the compound names should be either capitalized
or not capitalized throughout, not mixed Misspelling of “7-methly-1-indanone”

C in cyclohexen.
The compound at 5.86 min: The correct name according to CAS is 2-hydroxy-
3-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one.
Response: According to your suggestion, we have revised the text.
Figure 1: In the first “round-bottom flask”, the amounts of the different
compounds is given but not that of the Girard reagent. Is that intentional?
Response: It is our negligence that the amount of Girard reagent
is not given in Figure 1. The amount of Girard reagent is given in the
“Materials and Methods section-Derivatization and separation of
aldehydes and ketones”, and we also add this data in Figure 1 in the
revised manuscript.
We would like to thank the reviewer for providing constructive
comments and help in improving the contents of this manuscript. We
have revised the manuscript according to the reviewer’s suggestions.
We have responded to each comment in detail as shown below. Our
responses are formatted in italics.
Comments to the Author(s)-2
This paper presents an interesting piece of work dealing with the investigation
of aldehydes and ketones (AKs) in complex mixture by mass spectrometry
using a derivatization step by the Girard’s T reagent. This methodology is used
to compare the AK composition of two different cigarette smoke the MSS and
the SSS. In spite of the interest of this work significant major revision are
required for different reasons.
The introduction requires to be improved and modified. It has to be more
clearly focused on the analysis of cigarette smoke by non-targeted mass
spectrometry. Significant references are missing as those of the Zimmerman
group and those of other groups. In the last five years, a number of papers
reported the analysis of AKs in complex mixture by HR MS after a reduction
or a derivitization step. The papers have to be cited and discussed in the
introduction (and compared to the proposed methodology in the conclusion).
Response: Thanks for your suggestion. According to your
suggestion, we have added the following text in the introduction.
“The AKs in the complex matrix can be directly analyzed by gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS)[11, 12] or other
technique. Recently, Zimmermann and other groups[13-22] develop a
series of rapid and sensitive non-targeted mass spectrometry
technique to comprehensive analysis the carbonyls and other
components in complex matrix. The non-targeted method has the
advantage that there are no complicated post-processing steps, fast
and accurate.
One important issue in this paper is the use of two HR MS instruments. The
authors justified the use of orbitrap according to the low mass cut-off of FT
ICRMS which is too high to observe the “naked” AKs. This is correct, but the
orbitrap instrument has the capability to investigate both the low mass and the
high mass range. Moreover, authors observed on the orbitrap mass spectra ion
at higher m/z than on the FT ICR MS, this means that a part of the AKs, which
are derivatizated by Girard’s T reagent are not detected. Consequently, the
assertion of the authors concerning the same ionization efficiency for all
compounds after reaction of AKs with Girard’s reactant is totally wrong.
Response: According to your suggestion and the comment from
another reviewer, our expression “Since the highly conversion of AKs
reaction with Girard’s reagent, and the ionized groups after
derivatization are all quaternary ammonium groups (the ionization
efficiencies are basically the same)” is totally wrong. We have removed
this sentence in the revised manuscript. The related content has also
been modified accordingly. Furthermore, we have removed and revised
other statements about ‘justify quantifying based only on MS signal
heights’ in the revised manuscript.
The comparison of the DBE distribution for a given class compound (O1 for
example) is significantly different why? This deserves to be deeper discuss.
What about the compounds which contain two or more carbonyl chemical
groups?
Response: According to your suggestion, the following text were
revised:
“Figure 3 shows the iso-abundance plots of DBE as a function of
carbon number for O1 ~ O3 species. The O1 and O3 class species has
a DBE value ranges (1-13) and carbon number (6-35). Since the
carbonyl group contributes to an unsaturation, DBE = 1 series are
saturated AKs. The AKs with DBE=2-14 may contain unsaturated bond,
naphthenic and/or aromatic ring. O2 species with DBE = 1 are
saturated AKs but contained a hydroxyl or an ether group. O2 species
with DBE > 1 may contained two carbonyl group or unsaturated bond.
O3 species almost not contained DBE=1 series, suggest that at least
contained two carbonyl groups.
The abundance percentages of O1-3 species with DBE values of
1-4 and greater than 4 for MSS and SSS were calculated, respectively.
The results indicated that the SSS contain more unsaturated and
condensed AKPs than MSS. This may be due to the low level of oxygen
in the production of SSS facilitates the pyrolysis process. This consists
with the H/C ratio shown in Table 1.”
One other important issue is relative to the detection NxOy compounds by
ESI-FT ICR MS: how are the author sure that these species are associated with
derivatizated MSS/or SSS compounds. A large part of cigarette smoke
simultaneously contains nitrogen and oxygen see the paper corresponding to
ref 4 and the other papers of the same group. In the same way how are the
author sure that only AKs are present in the so-called AKs fraction? Without
this confirmation the obtained conclusions are highly disputable.
Response: The original AKs are neutral compound, so first step
the high-polarity acidic and basic fractions were removed by HCl and
KOH modified silica gel (solid phase extraction method). In this step,
the dichloromethane (DCM)/tetrahydrofuran (THF) = 7/3 (v/v) mixture
was used as the eluent to elute the neutral fraction. The polarity of
DCM/THF = 7/3 (v/v) is high enough to elute the aldehydes and ketones.
In the second step, the neutral fraction mixed with Girard reagent
and the Aks are converted into corresponding GirT derivatives. The
resulting GirT derivatives are very easy to separate. This is because
the polarity of the quaternary ammonium salt is much higher than the
other components in the neutral fraction. The mixture was subjected to
the chromatography and the DCM / methanol = 20/1 (v/v) was used as
the eluent. Because the polarity of DCM / methanol = 20/1 (v/v) is much
higher than the DCM/THF = 7/3 (v/v), the other neutral compounds
were removed very cleanly. The GirT derivatives still retain on the silica
gel and cannot be eluted due to its high polarity. Then a much higher
polarity eluent, DCM / methanol = 3/2 was used to elute the GirT
derivatives. The huge difference in polarity between these two parts
ensure only AKs are present in the AKs fraction. This can be ensured
by the methodological experiments in another article
(10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b03630).
We have added the following sentence in the revised manuscript:

What about the cotinine behavior which is a well-known cigarette smoke tracer?
Response: Cotinine with a structure: .Cotinine is
a neutral compound (lactam), but not an aldehyde or ketone compound.
It was eluted by DCM / methanol = 20/1 in the second step and not be
study by this work.
Why the authors used paper filters? More adequate filters are quartz filter for
which it can be considered that it cannot interact with the smoke sample.
Response: Thanks for the comment. That is true, we should use
the quartz filter. We bought the inappropriate filter, but we think this type
filter will not affect the analysis results of this study. This is because the
aldehyde and ketone cannot react with the filter; and the appropriate
solvent was used to completely elute the compound from the filter, and
the physical adsorption of the compound by the filter was excluded. The
model of the Cambridge filter pad we bought is F319-04 (paper filters),
which meets the requirements of Standard ISO3308:2000 (Routine
analytical cigarette-smoking machine-definitions and standard
conditions). But now the ISO3308:2000 has been withdrawn and
revised by ISO 3308:2012. We will remove the model of Cambridge
filter pad (F319-04) from this article so as not to mislead other
researchers. In future research we will use the quartz filter. Thanks
again.
Why collect the sample for 20 cigarettes in the same time. Interaction and
chemical reaction may happen between the still collected particles and the
compounds (in gas and PM phase). This may have a significant importance
after the 20 smoking procedure.
Response: We are sorry that we have caused a misunderstanding.
This is the original sentence in the article: “The particle phase of MSS
of 20 cigarettes was collected on whatman fiber pads.” We mean that
we totally collected 20 cigarettes’ particle phase to do the next
experiment. In this procedure, five cigarettes are smoked consecutively
under carefully controlled conditions. Then the particle phase on four
fiber pads were combined. We have revised the text:
“20 cigarettes were divided into four groups on average. The
particulate phase of MSS and SSS of each group was collected on fiber
pads under a set of internationally agreed standard smoking conditions
The particle phase on four fiber pads were eluted by DCM/MeOH = 3/1,
combined and stored at -20 °C.”
Details of the extraction step have to be given.
Response: According to your suggestion, we have added the
following sentences:
“The original AKs are neutral compound, so first step the high-
polarity acidic and basic fractions were removed by HCl and KOH
modified silica gel (solid phase extraction method). In this step, the
dichloromethane (DCM)/tetrahydrofuran (THF) = 7/3 (v/v) mixture was

DCM/THF = 7/3 (v/v) is high enough to elute the aldehydes and
ketones.”
“In the second step, the neutral fraction mixed with Girard reagent

the polarity of the quaternary ammonium salt is much higher than the
other components in the neutral fraction. The mixture was subjected to

“1 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate, 2 g of KOH-modified silica gel, 1
g of anhydrous sodium sulfate, 4 g of HCl acid-modified silica gel and
1 g anhydrous sodium sulfate were sequentially packed into a 1 cm
diameter column A. 10 g of ordinary silica gel, 1 g of anhydrous sodium
sulfate and 0.5 g of KOH-modified silica gel were sequentially packed
into another 1 cm diameter column B. The obtained cigarette smoke
particle phase (shown in Table 1) was dissolved in a 4 mL of DCM/THF
= 7/3 (v/v) mixture, and the solution was subjected to the
chromatography A using 25 mL of a DCM/THF = 7/3 (v/v) mixture as
the eluent to elute the neutral fraction. The polarity of the mixed solvent
is high enough to elute the aldehydes and ketones in the neutral
fraction.”
The non-controlled evaporation of the solvent may lead to the evaporation of
the more volatile cigarette smoke components.
Response: Agree. The solvent for neutral fraction and
aldehyde/ketone fraction is THF/DCM and DCM, respectively. When
evaporate the solvent by rotary evaporator, the bath temperature is
always controlled below 10 oC to prevent some smoke components
from volatilizing. Despite this, there is still some loss of volatile
components. This is the drawback of chemical derivatization method
compared to non-targeted method.
We have added the sentence in the revised manuscript:
“After removing the solvent below 10 oC by a rotary evaporator, the
neutral fraction was obtained.”
“Then the DCM layers were combined in a flask, the solvent was
removed by a rotary evaporator below 10 oC.”
“The post-treatment process may result in the loss of volatile
components, so some of small carbonyl specie cannot be observed in
the Figure 4.”
The mass resolution of FT ICR MS measurement has to be given.
Response: According to your suggestion, we have added the
sentence in the revised manuscript:
“The peaks with a 380000 resolving power at m/z = 326.”
Details of the “tentative identification and quantification” page 3 line 57/60.
The quantification aspect is not discussed in the results and discussion section.
Response: According to your suggestion, we have added the
following sentence in the revised manuscript:
“The quantitative results are listed in Table 2. Figure 4 and Table
2 shows that the AKPs in MSS and SSS are very close, but the content
is different. In addition, the content of specific carbonyl is very different
to each other. The content of high-carbon linear aldehydes
(Henicosanal to Pentacosanal) in MSS is higher than that of SSS, but
the content of some low-carbon aromatic-contained aldehydes (trans-
Cinnamaldehyde, alpha-Methylcinnamaldehyde) in sidestream smoke
is higher than that of mainstream smoke. This may be due to the fact
that MSS and SSS are formed in different ways of combustion. The
higher temperatures and higher amounts of oxygen lead to the breaking
of the carbon chain to form more linear aldehydes during MSS
produced. The low level of oxygen in the production of SSS facilitates
the pyrolysis process and form more unsaturated and condensed
AKPs.”
The figures are too small and very hard to be clearly examined. What’s mean
MK and CK in Fig 6.
Response: According to your suggestion, we have change the size
of the figures and revised the Fig 6.
Finally, authors have to give a comparison between what their findings are and
what it is reported in the literature.
Response: According to your suggestion, we have revised the
conclusion:
“In this work, the AKPs of MSS and SSS were successfully
separated and analyzed in detail. Total 63 AKs were identified and
quantified by GCMS. Due to the complex post-treatment of chemical
derivatization, a portion of volatile or unstable AKs are inevitably lost,
so the number of AKs that characterized by GCMS is less than already
reported.[52] Fifteen species of AKs were characterized by ESI FT-ICR
MS and Orbitrap MS: O1-6, N1O1-4, N2O1-3 and N3O2-3. Regardless of the
isomer, the total number of aldehydes and ketones obtained by ESI
FTICR MS in MSS and SSS is about 1100 and 970, respectively. This
number is much higher than the reported,[52] which indicated a large
amount of component cannot be resolved by the GCMS. Furthermore,
The nitrogen-containing carbonyls are more condensed and
unsaturated than O1-3 carbonyls. The AKPs in MSS are more
oxygenated and less unsaturated than that in SSS. Future work should
focus on the toxicity of the isolated carbonyls to humans and the
environment.”
