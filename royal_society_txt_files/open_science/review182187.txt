Dialogue, debate and critical discussion are fundamental to the scientific process. Professor
Kendrick carried out the original and more expansive research on facial recognition in sheep and
thus is very well placed to make critical comment on the work of Knoll et al. 2017 and also the
response by Towler et al. His comments both contextualise the recent research by Knoll et al and
also critically evaluates the validity of the Towler et al. response in terms of the prior research
that has been carried out in this area. This greatly adds to the discussion identifying our current
state of knowledge on the cognitive attributes of a non-human species such as the sheep.
