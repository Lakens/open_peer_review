You have provided a thorough and excellent account of why high COI divergence alone is not
sufficient to hypothesize cryptic diversity. I have only a few minor comments.
1) As noted in the review questions, I don't see anything in the Methods describing where you
have deposited the various genetic datasets that you have generated.
2) Line 190--change to 'rounded'
3) Your sample size for clade 3 is rather small (N=6). Can you put some text in the discussion as
to why you feel your data is sufficient to overcome your small sample size?
4) For Table 2, I think it makes more sense for the clade of the individuals be marked as 2 and 3
instead of 1 and 2--to be consistent with the rest of the labeling in the manuscript.
5) Can you provide that range and average COI distance between clades 2 & 3? This would be
more informative than just stating the max value.
6) Do you have any theories as to how the large level of COI divergence arose? The barcode gap
seems is apparent, so the haplotypes don't cover a continuous range of distances from 0 to 8%.
Could this be divergence driven by vicariance but then followed by secondary contact? How does
the geographic history of the two islands of NZ account for this? (Admittedly I'm woefully
ignorant on the subject) The mutation rates applied to the genetic distances would give you a
particular length of geologic time to discuss.

I think the MS is a nice contribution to the understanding of insect mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
variation, and really highlights an important issue with using solely mtDNA sequences as
markers for systematics. I can accept all your arguments and discussions based on your results,
there is only one thing I am a bit concerned. We saw that the particular population you studied
(Rangiwahia) has mt haplotypes which are really far from each other (38 mutations between
3
them). What is the origin of these very distant haplotypes? Is the length of the supposed stable
environment postulated for your species (40K years) long enough to make it possible to "develop"
so distant haplotypes? If these are the result of intrinsic development why there are no
intermediate haplotypes between the main haplogroups? Honestly saying, I am a bit dissatisfied
with the lack of explanation for the origin of this mtDNA variability. Certainly, this does not
mean that the overall finding is not valuable because you have convincingly shown that the two
lineages belong to the same biological population, but this does not mean old hybridisation could
not be the origin of this variability -- and I mean here hybridisation that occurred so long ago that
only mtDNA haplotypes are retained from the parental populations (please also note the overall
smaller Ne of the uniparentally inherited mitochondrial DNA) due to the large population
census, and linkage disequlibrium has already been demolished. Without at least speculating on
the origin of this large distance between mtDNA haplotypes I feel the story to be somehow
incomplete because your overall conclusion - in my view - should state only the following: large
insect population can RETAIN high mtDNA variability whatever the origin of it. So, I would
delete the part referring to mutation in the MS, as you cannot say that the origin of this large
genetic distance between the mtDNA haplotype is due to mutation within that population. I
would be happy to see if you tried to revise your MS to take the above line of reasoning also into
account.
I would also urge you to use the colloquial name of your study species consistently; sometimes, it
is spelled as weta, in other cases as weta (also weta in some of your other publications). I think it
is advisable to use a given spelling consistently.
I made some minor comments while reading your MS, I attach the file with the comments.

Dear Authors,
I think the authors did a good job in incorporating most of my minor recommendations to
7
improve their MS. Since my last review, I had an interesting discussion on their results with an
entomologist friend of mine (I am a botanist) by keeping all confidential information secure, we
only discussed the brief content of the MS. He pointed out that such mitho-nuclear discordance is
commonplace if the population is infected by Wolbachia bacteria -- that could easily explain why
the authors find evidence for the co-existence of different haplotypes within a single population
(see e.g. Kodandaramaia et al. Ecol Evol. 3(16): 5167-5176). This is a very likely way of how your
insect can hold different haplotypes within a single population. Please check carefully the review
about Wolbachia infection here, Toews & Brelsford Mol. Ecol. 21: 3907-3930. Unless you
extensively disscuss why you can exclude the possibility of Wolbachia infection for the currently
observed pattern you need to test your samples if they are infected with (different strains of)
Wolbachia. But the possibility of Wolbachia-infection have to be included in the Discussion at
least. Otherwise, your paper can become an example of ignorance of such mitho-nuclear
discordence!

3 25 Abstract. Mitochondrial DNA sequence is frequently used to infer species’
4
5 26 boundaries, as divergence is relatively rapid when populations are reproductively
6 27 isolated. There are four distinct processes that can lead to high levels of mtDNA
7
8 28 sequence difference within a single sample. Here we examine one case in detail as an
9
10 29 exemplar to distinguish among competing hypotheses. Within our sample of tree
11 30 weta (Hemideina crassidens; Orthoptera) we found multiple mtDNA haplotypes for a
12
13 31 protein-coding region (CytB/ND2) that differed by a maximum of 7.9%. From
14
15 32 sequencing the whole mitochondrial genome of two representative individuals we
16 33 found evidence of constraining selection. Individuals were genotyped for five
17
18 34 independent nuclear loci and evidence of genetic partitioning was sought. We found
19
20 35 that heterozygotes were as common as expected under random mating. Morphological
21 36 traits were combined with nuclear markers in a model-based clustering approach.
22
23 37 Different traits did not resolve the same groupings of individuals although more than
24
25 38 one genotypic cluster was found. Although DNA barcoding might suggest two
26 39 species, we concluded that the large differences found among mtDNA sequences were
27
28 40 simply due to a large population size over a long time period allowing an equilibrium
29
30 41 between mutation and drift to retain a great deal of genetic diversity.

3 48 1. Introduction
4 49 High levels of mitochondrial sequence divergence can be misconstrued as indicating
5
6 50 the presence of more than one species if a naïve application of the DNA barcoding
7
51 approach is followed. Although the acquisition of mitochondrial sequence data has
8
9 52 been promoted as a tool for identification of specimens (1,2) the application of
10
11 53 mtDNA data frequently raises questions rather than discriminating among hypotheses.
12
54 However, its capacity for assigning specimens to previously identified, classified, and
13
14 55 sequenced maternal lineages is valuable for many aspects of biology that require this
15
16 56 kind of identification. Issues relating to biosecurity, forensics, conservation and
17
57 animal diet, where extensive reference collections have been made with the necessary
18
19 58 investment in mtDNA or cpDNA sequencing benefit from this approach e.g. (3–7).
20
21 59 Unfortunately, fifteen years since its introduction the fundamental flaws of DNA
22
60 barcoding as an approach for taxonomic discovery (8–10) are still often ignored.
23
24 61 MtDNA “barcode” sequence variation above about 3% coupled with spatial structure
25
26 62 or sympatry tends to lead to inferences of morphologically cryptic taxonomic
27
63 diversity, even though theory provides other explanations. The presence within a
28
29 64 single interbreeding population of multiple mtDNA lineages or haplogroups that
30
31 65 differ by more than 3% sequence divergence is, for example, likely if populations
32
66 have been large for some protracted period. Here we demonstrate how hypotheses
33
34 67 can be distinguished using a New Zealand orthopteran as a case study.

69 Four biological processes might lead to high genetic diversity at a locus within a
39 70 single population sample. In a stable population neutral genetic variants arise at a
40
41 71 predictable rate and are stochastically lost via drift at a rate determined by population
42
43
72 size (11,12). In large populations, the presence of many individuals increases the
44 73 potential for new mutations each generation and the rate of allele loss via drift is
45
46 74 relatively slow. Typically therefore, invertebrate populations with relatively small
47
48
75 individuals and large populations contain much more genetic diversity than large
49 76 vertebrate species with their small effective populations. For example, compare
50
51 77 mammal host and insect parasite diversity levels e.g. (13–15). High genetic diversity
52
78 within a sample might therefore be due to persistence of a large population at
53
54 79 equilibrium between mutation and drift (12). In contrast, non-neutral alleles are lost
55
56 80 or go to fixation more rapidly at a rate proportional to their selection coefficient and
57
58
81 so are less likely to reveal high diversity. Balancing selection could however explain

3 82 high genetic diversity within a single population sample if fitness was determined by
4
5 83 frequency in the population. In the case of the mtDNA sequence, balancing selection
6 84 is possible if the variation involves expressed differences. Comparing the number of
7
8 85 synonymous changes with the number of non-synonymous changes allows inference
9
10 86 of the likely selection process. Neutral genetic variation can be explained by
11 87 population size in the absence of evidence of other processes.
12
13 88
14
15 89 The third and fourth processes leading to a putative single population sample
16 90 containing relatively high genetic diversity are cryptic species (16) and recent
17
18 91 introgression (17). Elegant population genetics tools are available to differentiate
19
20 92 between these possible sources of genetic diversity if information is available from
21 93 more than one marker (18–21).
22
23 94
24
25 95 Morphological variation derived from genotypic variation can provide the information
26 96 needed to determine whether high genetic diversity results from sampling more than
27
28 97 one species (16). Independent populations would show linkage of alleles at
29
30 98 independent loci and a lack of heterozygote individuals. Concordance of characters
31 99 and absence of intermediates provide evidence for multiple genotypic clusters
32
33 100 (species; (22)). The presence of cryptic species provides no expectation of geographic
34
35 101 limits. On the other hand, hybridisation is usually geographically constrained (23,24),
36 102 producing a restricted region or zone of high diversity. Within these regions of
37
38 103 hybridisation bimodal distributions of genetic and/or phenotypic characters are
39
40 104 indicative of selection against hybrids (20). In the case where high mtDNA diversity
41 105 arises from hybridisation, the detection of an association of unlinked markers would
42
43 106 be expected.
44
45 107
46 108 In New Zealand many endemic invertebrates have been subjects of phylogeographic
47
48 109 investigations and their mtDNA genetic diversity used to infer historical range
49
50 110 changes (25,26). Interpretation of notably high levels of mtDNA sequence variation
51 111 within samples varies (reviewed in (26)). For example mtDNA differences have been
52
53 112 ascribed to an accelerated rate of mtDNA evolution (27), or ancient (Pliocene)
54
55 113 subdivision of populations and subsequent hybridisation (28). The contrast between
56 114 Southern and Northern hemisphere study systems is striking. Low diversity in many
57
58 115 invertebrate species in Europe and North America is concordant with recent absence

3 116 of suitable habitat due to southward extension of polar ice sheets during the last
4
5 117 glacial maximum (~32,000–28,000 years ago; (29–32). Despite large modern species’
6 118 ranges, low diversity in these areas is inferred as resulting from recent range
7
8 119 expansion (18). In contrast, although smaller, New Zealand lost disproportionally less
9
10 120 terrestrial habitat to snow and ice, and lower sea level combined with coastal marine
11 121 conditions ensured widespread survival of forest/scrub habitat (33–35).
12
13 122
14
15 123 One endemic insect, the tree weta Hemideina crassidens (Orthoptera; Ensifera;
16 124 Anostostomatidae) was probably widespread in North Island New Zealand during the
17
18 125 last glacial maximum (35). This arboreal weta species contains three distinct lineages
19
20 126 of mtDNA haplotypes (figure 1) with average genetic distances among clades of
21 127 0.07–0.09 (GTR model with variable base frequencies; symmetrical substitution
22
23 128 matrix); much higher than levels typically accepted within species (1). One H.
24
25 129 crassidens mtDNA haplogroup is restricted to weta samples from the southern part of
26 130 the species’ range, concordant with a distinct 19-chromosome race (36). Two others,
27
28 131 (lineages 2 & 3) have overlapping occurrence in South and North Island H. crassidens
29
30 132 (figure 1). Both mtDNA lineages 2 and 3 occur within the 15-chromosome race of
31 133 this insect (35).
32
33 134
34
35 135 Our aim was to determine what biological process most likely led to the high mtDNA
36 136 diversity within the 15-chromosome race of Hemideina crassidens. We looked for
37
38 137 spatial structure in the mtDNA diversity over the full landscape of the species for
39
40 138 evidence of partitions in the distribution of genetic variation, a signature of past
41 139 isolation followed by hybridisation. We then focused on a sample from a single
42
43 140 location where both lineages are present. By examining nuclear markers we sought
44
45 141 evidence of partitioning of genetic variation concordant with mtDNA variation that
46 142 would support a hypothesis of two species. We compared the rate of silent
47
48 143 substitutions to expressed substitutions using the whole mtDNA genome to detect any
49
50 144 signature of selection.

54
55 147 2.1 Spatial structure of mtDNA diversity within Hemideina crassidens
56 148 The distribution of mitochondrial sequence variation within the natural range of
57
58 149 Hemideina crassidens was explored to identify potential spatial structure that might

3 150 arise from historical processes or selection (data published in (35)). We examined the
4
5 151 distribution of the three distinct mitochondrial haplogroups in relation to both latitude
6 152 and elevation. We visualized genetic distance patterns across the complete range of H.
7
8 153 crassidens using three-dimensional surface plots known as ‘genetic landscape shapes’
9
10 154 in the Alleles In Space software (AIS, http://www.marksgeneticsoftware.net/,(37)).
11 155 First, a connectivity network of sampled individuals was constructed and genetic
12
13 156 distances (Zi, calculated as the average proportion of nucleotide differences between
14
15 157 individuals from different sampling areas) assigned to landscape coordinates at
16 158 midpoints (Xi, Yi) of the connectivity edges, as described in Miller et al. (38). Genetic
17
18 159 distances were then inferred using an interpolation procedure on a uniformly spaced
19
20 160 grid overlaid on the sampled landscape. Third, a 3-dimensional surface plot where X
21 161 and Y coordinates correspond to geographic locations (latitude and longitude) on a
22
23 162 rectangular grid and surface plot heights (Z) reflecting genetic distances was
24
25 163 generated (39,40), We selected a 50 × 50 grid and a distance weighting parameter (a)
26 164 of 1. Additional analyses were performed using a variety of grid sizes (50 × 50, 60 x
27
28 165 60, 100 × 100), distance weighting parameters (a = 0.5–2) and raw and residual
29
30 166 genetic distances to make sure that interpretations were not sensitive to these
31 167 parameters, as recommended.
32
33 168
34
35 169 High nucleotide diversity (due to the coexistence of two distinct mitochondrial
36 170 haplotypes) was recorded in a tree weta sample from Rangiwahia Forest Park
37
38 171 (39°53'38.51"S; 176° 0'10.80"E) in central North Island New Zealand (35).
39
40 172 Additional weta were collected at this location for the present analysis. A random
41 173 sample of weta with respect to age and sex were extracted from their daytime refuge
42
43 174 holes in tree branches. Authority to collect came from New Zealand Department of
44
45 175 Conservation [TW-32116-FAU]. All individuals were identified as Hemideina
46 176 crassidens using a combination of colour and spine traits that differentiates this
47
48 177 species from other Hemideina (41).
49
50 178
51 179 2.2 Morphological variation
52
53 180 Two morphological traits were recorded for each individual: total number of
54
55 181 stridulatory ridges and total number of hind tibia dorsal spines. Neither of these traits
56 182 are known to correlate with weta instar and therefore weta at any age can be included
57
58 183 in the analysis. Tree weta use the abdominal stridulatory ridges to make rasping

2
3 184 sounds when rubbed against pegs on the retrolateral surface of the hind femur,
4
5 185 probably for intraspecific communication (42). Ridge numbers vary within and
6 186 among tree weta species (43). The number of ridges on the left and right sides of the
7
8 187 abdomen were combined. The number of prolateral hind tibial spines differentiates H.
9
10 188 crassidens and H. thoracica at some locations suggesting interspecific selection. We
11 189 therefore recorded all dorsal hind tibia spines (left and right) for each individual at
12
13 190 Rangiwahia. Tubercles with rouned ends rather then points (as seen in spines) were
14
15 191 recorded as half spines (0.5) if they occurred in the normal position for a dorsal tibia
16 192 spine.
17
18 193
19
20 194 2.3 mtDNA analysis
21 195 Genomic DNA was extracted and a ~800 bp mtDNA fragment amplified as
22
23 196 previously described (35). The DNA sequences were checked, edited and aligned in
24
25 197 Geneious v.8.1.4 (http://www.geneious.com,(44)). We calculated average nucleotide
26 198 site diversity (p) for the population sample using the method of Tajima (45) with an
27
28 199 alignment of mtDNA sequence and tools provided in Geneious. We estimated
29
30 200 population size using the equation N = p/4u (12). Three mutation rate estimates from
31 201 published work were used to calculate population size: Drosophila rate of 6.2 x 10-8
32
33 202 (46); Daphnia 1.5 x 10-7 (47); Nematode 7.6 x 10-8 (48). The tRNASer sequence
34
35 203 within the mtDNA fragment was removed from the dataset before networks were
36 204 inferred. Deletions and insertions (INDELS) in this tRNA region differentiate the
37
38 205 haplotypes, but this variation is not readily incorporated into network analysis nor
39
40 206 estimates of genetic distance. A minimum spanning network (49) was inferred with
41 207 PopArt (50) using 29 sequences, trimmed to 519 bp.
42
43
44 208 2.4 Nuclear markers
45
46 209 One coding, putatively-neutral nuclear locus (Sflag; Sperm flagallar protein; (51))
47 210 was amplified and sequenced, and coded as genotype data for analysis in combination
48
49 211 with microsatellite loci. The 400 bp fragment of the nuclear gene (Sflag), was
50
51 212 amplified and sequenced using the primers TWnucSflagF
52 213 (5´TCGCCAGTTCAGACCTAGGATGAGG3´) and TWnucSflagR
53
54 214 (5´TGGCTCTGTACAAGGCTGGGA3´) (51). Only two Sflag alleles were detected
55
56 215 and as some weta were homozygous at this locus, heterozygote individuals could be

3 216 identified and genotyped as they contained two nucleotides at each of the three sites
4
5 217 that differentiate the two alleles.
6 218
7
8 219 Four microsatellite loci (HM04, HR12, HR35, HR43) were amplified using primers
9
10 220 and PCR conditions developed for other species within the genus Hemideina (52,53).
11 221 One primer from each pair was fluorescently labelled with either 6-FAM, PET or VIC
12
13 222 dyes (Applied Biosystems). Fluorescent DNA fragments including a size standard
14
15 223 were detected using an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems) and sized
16 224 with the Geneious microsat plugin and individuals manually genotyped.
17
18 225
19
20 226 Evidence of linkage disequilibrium and deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
21 227 were examined using Genpop v.4.2 (54,55), with the following Markov chain
22
23 228 parameters; 10,000 dememorization, 100 batches, 10,000 iterations per batch.
24
25 229 Evidence of linkage disequilibrium used probability tests with bonferroni correction
26 230 for multiple tests (n = 10; p < 0.005). Where two species are sympatric, but rarely or
27
28 231 never interbreeding, alleles at independent loci are expected to show linkage
29
30 232 disequilibrium as heterozygote individuals will be scarce or absent. With our weta
31 233 sample treated as a single population sample, detection of heterozygote deficiency
32
33 234 would indicate non-random mating.
34
35 235
36 236 Our sample was divided in two: weta with mtDNA from clade 2 (n = 23) and weta
37
38 237 with mtDNA from clade 3 (n = 6). If these weta with mtDNA haplotypes in distinct
39
40 238 lineages represent members of non-interbreeding populations (e.g. different species)
41 239 differentiation would result in significant departure of FST from zero. Pairwise FST
42
43 240 was estimated using genotypes at five nuclear loci with Genpop v.4.2.
44
45 241
46 242 2.5 Whole mtDNA selection
47
48 243 Two individuals, representing two mtDNA clades, were used to calculate the Ka/Ks
49
50 244 ratio in the coding regions of the mtDNA using both maximum likelihood and
51 245 approximate methods in the software KaKs_Calculator (56). The Ka/Ks ratio
52
53 246 identifies the selective pressures occurring in protein-coding genes; a ratio of 1
54
55 247 implies neutral selection, >1 implies positive selection and <1 implies constraining
56 248 (purifying) selection. Constraining selection is predicted for coding DNA in large
57
58 249 populations. Total genomic DNA from two individuals (H. crassidens clade 2

2
3 250 (North) and H. crassidens clade 3 (South)) were separately processed through massive
4
5 251 parallel, high-throughput sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2000) to obtain whole
6 252 mitochondrial sequences for a separate phylogenetic study (57). Genomic DNA was
7
8 253 fragmented, prepared using the ThruPLEX® DNA-seq Kit (Rubicon Genomics) and
9
10 254 used to generate 100 bp paired-end sequence. Adapter sequence barcodes and poor
11 255 quality data were removed from Illumina sequence reads using cutadapt (58). The
12
13 256 quality of the data was assessed using SolexaQA (59) before de novo assembly with
14
15 257 VELVET v1.1 (60) and ABYSS v2.3.3 (61) using a kmer length of 49. Contig files
16 258 were compared to annotated Orthoptera mitochondrial sequences available on
17
18 259 GenBank (NCBI). We found evidence of nuclear copies of some regions of the
19
20 260 mtDNA and were able to remove paralogs using relative copy number and
21 261 translations. The resulting assembled mitochondrial genomes were 16,535 and 15,905
22
23 262 bp in length for H. crassidens clade 2 and clade 3 respectively (total 11,199 bp of
24
25 263 coding regions) with the same gene order previously identified in Ensifera (62), but
26 264 with the inclusion of a repetitive unit of several hundred bp in length between tRNAQ
27
28 265 and COX1.
29
30 266
31 267 2.6 Population genetic analysis with PCA
32
33 268 Principal components analysis was performed on the morphological and genetic data
34
35 269 combined (excluding mtDNA). Stridulatory ridge counts and tibia spine counts were
36 270 each treated as a single trait (range 9 – 15 ridges; 18.5 – 22 spines). For nuclear loci
37
38 271 we treated each allele as a character trait and each individual was given a character
39
40 272 state per allele: 0 (if absent), 1, or 2 (if homozygous), as recommended by Odong et
41 273 al. (2013). Alleles within a locus are not independent thus a principal component
42
43 274 analysis is an appropriate dimensionality reduction tool. PCA was performed with
44
45 275 standardization using the function prcomp in R package ‘STATS’ (R Development
46 276 Core Team, 2008) (filename, center = FALSE, scale = TRUE). The first five principal
47
48 277 components (cumulative proportion of variance was 0.664) were then used in a
49
50 278 model-based clustering approach using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to select
51 279 the number of genotypic clusters in the R package ‘Mclust’ (63,64). Model-based
52
53 280 clustering was used to classify individual weta without prior information about
54
55 281 number of clusters or specimen identity (63). The Mclust algorithm is built from a
56 282 general model, where the total data set is considered as a mixture of multivariate
57
58 283 normal data sets, with a selection of covariance structures and vectors of expectation
59

2
3 284 (65). The Mclust analysis examined 90 models (10 different models with various
4
5 285 combinations of parameterization and 1 to 9 clusters/components). The best model
6 286 was selected based on the maximized log likelihood, with a penalty for the number of
7
8 287 parameters in the model (63,65). We compared the concordance of clusters resolved
9
10 288 from mitochondrial haplogroups with nuclear data (phenotype and microsatellite
11 289 genotypes) using Cohen’s kappa. Cohen's kappa coefficient is a statistic that measures
12
13 290 agreement of assignment to categories, where values between 0.75 and 1 indicate non-
14
15 291 random agreement, but where there is no agreement among the methods other than
16 292 what would be expected by chance kappa = 0 (online statistical calculator:
17
18 293 https://www.niwa.co.nz/node/104318/kappa).

21 295 3. Results
22
23 296
24
25 297 High nucleotide diversity due to the coexistence of three distinct mitochondrial
26 298 haplotypes has been described within the natural range of Hemideina crassidens (Fig.
27
28 299 1A; Appendix S1 of (35); jbi12224-sup-0001-AppendixS1-S3.docx). Examination of
29
30 300 spatial structure in this mtDNA diversity revealed patterns concordant with some
31 301 geographic constraints. Clade 1 haplotypes (concordant with chromosome race 19) is
32
33 302 found south of -41o5´, in contrast, no evidence of partitioning was observed among
34
35 303 clade 2 and 3 haplotypes concordant with latitude (figure 1) or elevation (data not
36 304 shown). Lack of spatial structure through the range of H. crassidens is well illustrated
37
38 305 by Genetic Landscape Shape interpolation (figure 2). ‘Peaks’ indicating greatest
39
40 306 genetic distances between population samples are scattered at random across New
41 307 Zealand. Qualitatively similar results were obtained using different grid sizes and a
42
43 308 range of distance weighting parameters (a = 0.5–2). Thus we obtained no evidence of
44
45 309 structure suggestive of secondary contact of previously isolated populations, nor
46 310 evidence of barriers or discontinuities within the range of mtDNA haplotype clades 2
47
48 311 and 3.

3 340 We expanded sampling of a single population of H. crassidens where haplotypes from
4
5 341 clade 2 and 3 co-occur in North Island (Rangiwahi, figure 2). We sequenced a 702-bp
6 342 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragment spanning part of cytochrome b (cytb), tRNA
7
8 343 Serine and part of NADH dehydrogenase 1 (ND1). Ten haplotypes were resolved
9
10 344 from 29 individuals collected from Rangiwahi (all data files available at:
11 345 http://evolves.massey.ac.nz/DNA_Toolkit.htm). Average nucleotide site diversity (p)
12
13 346 for this population sample was high (0.1035). Using this nucleotide site diversity,
14
15 347 estimates of population size ranged from 172,500 – 417,338 depending on mutation
16 348 rate used. The only available insect example (Drosophila mtDNA) has the lowest
17
18 349 mutation rate and thus gave the largest population size estimate.

25 353 attributable to haplogroup 2 or 3 of the previously reported H. crassidens diversity
26 354 (35) (figure 1) These haplotypes differ by a maximum of 7.9% (uncorrected; 41
27
28 355 substitutions out of 519 bp; figure 1). When translated, three nucleotide substitutions
29
30 356 resulted in amino-acid replacements that could be subject to natural selection.
31 357 However, when we calculated the Ka/Ks ratio for all coding regions of the whole
32
33 358 mitochondrial genome (representing the two mtDNA clades; available at:
34
35 359 http://evolves.massey.ac.nz/DNA_Toolkit.htm) the result was <1 (0.03), implying
36 360 constraining selection not positive balancing selection was occurring in the mtDNA.

38 361
39
40 362 Each weta from the Rangiwahia population sample was genotyped at five
41 363 polymorphic nuclear loci. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 12 (table
42
43 364 1). None of the five nuclear loci showed evidence of linkage to any other locus (P
44
45 365 values ranged between 1 and 0.021). Hardy-Weinberg expectations were met with no
46 366 evidence of homozygote or heterozygote excess (multi-locus exact tests: heterozygote
47
48 367 deficit P = 0.9321; heterozygote excess P = 0.0679). Weta haplogroups showed no
49
50 368 evidence of genetic differentiation at nuclear loci between the two groups. Population
51 369 pairwise FST = -0.01777; genotypic differentiation was 0 (P = 0.895965 exact G test;
52
53 370 P = 0.897884 Fisher’s method).

21 385 averaged 20.02 and 20.20 (T-test P > 0.05). Frequency plots of these traits were

23
24 387 principal components 1 and 2 (45.5% of variation) showed no concordance with
25
26 388 mtDNA clade. Although two genotypic clusters were resolved as the best model using
27
389 the cluster-based approach (Mclust) with the first five principal components (66.4%
28
29 390 of variation) these clusters were not concordant with mtDNA groups (Cohen’s kappa
30
31 391 estimate was -0.050). Interestingly, the clusters inferred for just PC1 and PC2 did not
32

27 425 4. Discussion
28
29 426
30
31
427 We confirmed that the population sample of tree weta from Rangiwahia contains high
32 428 mtDNA diversity resulting from the presence of individuals at the same location with
33
34 429 very different haplotypes. We considered four biological processes that might result in
35
36
430 this pattern. Secondary contact and hybridisation was not supported by the spatial
37 431 distribution of mtDNA clades 2 and 3. The presence of cryptic species and/or
38
39 432 hybridisation was not supported due to the lack of genetic linkage, presence of
40
41
433 heterozygotes, and lack of genetic differentiation (FST). Combining two
42 434 morphological characters with nuclear markers we observed no concordance among
43
44 435 clusters inferred from different datasets (mtDNA, nuclear). Although some mtDNA
45
46
436 sequence differences were expressed we detected the signature of constraining
47 437 selection within the whole mitochondrial genome, not diversifying selection that
48
49 438 would be more likely if balancing selection was maintaining the high mtDNA
50
51
439 diversity (66,67). We studied the whole mtDNA genome so can exclude the
52 440 possibility of diversifying selection in other regions of the (non-recombining)
53
54 441 molecule. Therefore, retention of a large population is the most likely explanation for
55
56
442 the genetic diversity observed here within H. crassidens. Our estimates of population
57 443 size (170K – 420K) are not unreasonable for an herbivorous ectotherm. Although

3 444 large for an insect, Hemideina crassidens has probably been abundant for some time;
4
5 445 retaining large population sizes in New Zealand during the climate cycling of the last
6 446 40K years (35).
7
8 447
9
10 448 We have shown here how hypotheses that arise from large mtDNA sequence
11 449 differences can be tested using phenotypic and nuclear genetic data. As there is no
12
13 450 evidence of balancing selection or that these mtDNA differences represent biological
14
15 451 lineages with separate histories, we suggest that large population size explains the
16 452 observed diversity. We urge others to consider population size rather than cryptic
17
18 453 species as a null hypothesis when a lack of nuclear data prevents testing of alternative
19
20 454 theories.

Dear Kevin Padian (Subject Editor, Royal Society Open Science)
Thank-you for the reviews of our manuscript and the opportunity to submit this revision of our paper -
“Explaining large mitochondrial sequence differences within a population sample" [RSOS-170730].
The reviews were very helpful and we are grateful for the time taken by the reviewers. We have
endeavored to correct and improve the manuscript in response to all suggestions. Our responses are
provided to each point below. We acknowledge that our previous manuscript had a very brief discussion
and we did not adequately explain the expectations of tree shape from a population sample of a single
non-recombining gene. By expanding and explaining in more detail we feel this has improved the work
considerably, and answered the questions put forward by both reviewers.
Please get in touch if further details are required. We look forward to hearing from you.
Yours truly,
Mary Morgan-Richards

Associate Editor's comments:
Two reviewers have examined your MS and both appreciate its content, as do I. However, they do have
some comments that I would like you to address that go beyond the realm of minor revisions, especially
in the discussion.
Comments to Author:
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
You have provided a thorough and excellent account of why high COI divergence alone is not sufficient
to hypothesize cryptic diversity. I have only a few minor comments.
1) As noted in the review questions, I don't see anything in the Methods describing where you have
deposited the various genetic datasets that you have generated.
>>The original manuscript provided details of data depositary in two places:
Line 344: (all data files available at: http://evolves.massey.ac.nz/DNA_Toolkit.htm). page 16 (main
text)
Line 458: Data availability. Data can be downloaded from the following sites:
jbi12224-sup-0001-AppendixS1-S3.docx
http://evolves.massey.ac.nz/Data/Rangiwahia%20weta.zip
doi:10.5061/dryad.rg15p (if article accepted for publication).
We have now repeated these details in the methods (lines: 234-235; 278-280).
2) Line 190--change to 'rounded'
>>corrected, thank you <U+263A>
3) Your sample size for clade 3 is rather small (N=6). Can you put some text in the discussion as to why
you feel your data is sufficient to overcome your small sample size?
>>We agree that this needs consideration. The tests comparing specimens representing the two mtDNA
clades incorporate sample size, e.g. mcclust finds more than one cluster but they are not associated with
mtDNA. And the comparison of allelic frequency variation also incorporates sample size into the test
(exact G test and Fisher’s method). In addition, if there was a difference between the two mtDNA clades
but our sample size was too small to detect it, it is very unlikely that we would have observed a negative
value for pairwise FST.
“Population pairwise FST = -0.01777; genotypic differentiation was 0 (P = 0.895965 exact G test; P =
0.897884 Fisher’s method).”
We have added three sentences to the discussion to this effect (line 386-393).
4) For Table 2, I think it makes more sense for the clade of the individuals be marked as 2 and 3 instead
of 1 and 2--to be consistent with the rest of the labeling in the manuscript.
>>Good point! Now corrected.
5) Can you provide that range and average COI distance between clades 2 & 3? This would be more
informative than just stating the max value.
>>The two haplotypes observed from the two clades (sympatric at Rangiwahia) differed by between 38
and 42 substitutions (average distance of 7.55%). We have now added a histogram (figure 3A) to
illustrate the pairwise distances and provided additional details to the text (lines 340-344).
6) Do you have any theories as to how the large level of COI divergence arose? The barcode gap seems
is apparent, so the haplotypes don't cover a continuous range of distances from 0 to 8%. Could this be
divergence driven by vicariance but then followed by secondary contact? How does the geographic
history of the two islands of NZ account for this? (Admittedly I'm woefully ignorant on the subject) The
mutation rates applied to the genetic distances would give you a particular length of geologic time to
discuss.
>>Within our sampling of Hemideina crassidens over the whole of its range in New Zealand we observed
three distinct haplotype lineages. Two of these lineages were represented in our single population
sample at Rangiwahia. The stochastic processes of mutation and extinction of mtDNA lineages within
large populations (single species) will frequently result in very divergent mtDNA haplotypes due to the
process of coalescence of a non-recombining gene. In a population of constant size, the sample
distribution of pairwise differences will typically deviate from the expected (null distribution), because
the history of coalescent events in a single gene imposes a substantial correlation on pairwise
differences (Slatkin & Hudson 1999). For example, simulation studies that have incorporated a range of
population sizes find that over-splitting is a problem with large populations (Delilicour & Flot 2015.
Delimiting Species-Poor Data Sets using Single Molecular Markers: A Study of Barcode Gaps, Haplowebs
and GMYC. Syst Biol. & Esselstyn et al. 2012). Production of diversity from mutation and slow loss via
drift (due to large population size) results in high diversity. If more complex population process (such as
recently declining population size) are incorporated into simulations the excess of recent coalescent
events create mtDNA clusters within species. Thus the apparent bar coding gap could be the result of a
large population with recent decline from habitat (forest) destruction, or range expansion and leading
edge effects. These “barcoding gaps” can be misidentified as evidence of separate taxa as observed by
Fujisawa & Barraclough (2013; Delimiting species using single-locus data and the generalized mixed
Yule coalescent approach: A revised method and evaluation on simulated data sets. Syst. Biol. 62:707-
724).
We can speculate that the most recent common ancestor of the three distinct mtDNA lineages might
have existed about 3-4 million years ago. The shape of New Zealand was considerably different from
that of the current islands (Trewick & Bland 2012), but this does not bear any relevance/relationship to
the current distribution of mtDNA haplotypes observed today. One can also speculate that during range
expansion (either north during cool phases, or south during warming) smaller effective population size
might have resulted in coalescent events that created the appearance of a gap. MtDNA clade 1 is
restricted to recently colonized southern sites – suggesting leading edge effects have produced recent
coalescent events to create this mtDNA clusters within the species. However, as both clade 2 and clade
3 are widespread, loss of their “intermediates” is not associated with recent range shifts. And the history
of coalescent events in the non-recombining mtDNA imposes a substantial correlation on pairwise
differences resulting in the multi-modal frequency distributions observed.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
I think the MS is a nice contribution to the understanding of insect mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
variation, and really highlights an important issue with using solely mtDNA sequences as markers for
systematics.
I can accept all your arguments and discussions based on your results, there is only one thing I am a bit
concerned. We saw that the particular population you studied (Rangiwahia) has mt haplotypes which are
really far from each other (38 mutations between them).
>>We chose to focus on this location for just this reason. The two haplotype lineages are both
widespread, and can and do occur within the same region. This provided us the opportunity to compare
weta with different mtDNA haplotypes without the confounding effect of different sample locations.
What is the origin of these very distant haplotypes?
>>The stochastic processes of mutation and extinction of non-recombining mtDNA lineages within large
populations (single species) will frequently result in very divergent mtDNA haplotypes. Large Ne results
in over estimation of species diversity (Esselstyn et al. 2012). In a population of constant size, the
sample distribution of pairwise differences deviates from the geometric distribution because the history
of coalescent events imposes a substantial correlation on pairwise differences (Slatkin & Hudson 1999).
Thus the origin is linked evolution on the same gene fragment.
Is the length of the supposed stable environment postulated for your species (40K years) long enough to
make it possible to "develop" so distant haplotypes?
>>We have rewritten this section as we acknowledge the inference as previously written was not clear
and explicit. We only have evidence for the last 40K years because each cycle covers up the signature of
the earlier range changes. If, as we argue in Bulagarella et al. 2015, this species retained large
populations during the last glacial and this current inter-galcial, we can extrapolate that large
populations survived through all climate cycles of the last 2.6 million years. Our knowledge of the
climate during the Pliocene would not exclude large areas of available habitat for H. crassidens,
providing no time limit to the large population size of this species.
If these are the result of intrinsic development why there are no intermediate haplotypes between the
main haplogroups?
>>Simulation studies show that lack of intermediate haplotypes is expected (Slatkin & Hudson 1991;
Fujisawa & Barraclough 2013).
Honestly saying, I am a bit dissatisfied with the lack of explanation for the origin of this mtDNA
variability. Certainly, this does not mean that the overall finding is not valuable because you have
convincingly shown that the two lineages belong to the same biological population, but this does not
mean old hybridisation could not be the origin of this variability -- and I mean here hybridisation that
occurred so long ago that only mtDNA haplotypes are retained from the parental populations (please
also note the overall smaller Ne of the uniparentally inherited mitochondrial DNA) due to the large
population census, and linkage disequlibrium has already been demolished.
>>These comments are very helpful because it shows us where we need to provide more details. And
gives us the opportunity to “speculate” in the discussion. Old hybridization is possible but the current
distribution of the haplotypes within the range of the species does not provide support for this.
Without at least speculating on the origin of this large distance between mtDNA haplotypes I feel the
story to be somehow incomplete because your overall conclusion - in my view - should state only the
following: large insect population can RETAIN high mtDNA variability whatever the origin of it. So, I
would delete the part referring to mutation in the MS, as you cannot say that the origin of this large
genetic distance between the mtDNA haplotype is due to mutation within that population. I would be
happy to see if you tried to revise your MS to take the above line of reasoning also into account.
>>We have reworded and expanded this section of the discussion (see lines 429-426), and added
additional important references.
I would also urge you to use the colloquial name of your study species consistently; sometimes, it is
spelled as weta, in other cases as weta (also weta in some of your other publications). I think it is
advisable to use a given spelling consistently.
I made some minor comments while reading your MS, I attach the file with the comments.
>>Thank you, we have now replaced all uses with weta which we think is correct.
We have edited in response to helpful comments on pdf, including explaining abbreviations and adding
references. Thanks.
Appendix C
24th October 2017
Dear Kevin Padian (Subject Editor, Royal Society Open Science) and Alice Power (Editorial Coordinator)
Thank-you for the second review of our manuscript and the opportunity to submit this revision of our
paper - “Explaining large mitochondrial sequence differences within a population sample" [RSOS-
170730].
The reviewer constructively points out that Wolbachia infections can lead to unexpected patterns of
mitochondrial diversity. In this revision we were very happy to mention this bacteria as one source of
reproductive isolation that could then be detected with nuclear data. Fortunately, we already have
looked for Wolbachia in our study species and can eliminate this explanation. We currently have a
manuscript in review (PLOS one) describing an investigation of Wolbachia infections of New Zealand
insects. Our findings provide the first evidence of endemic NZ species infected with Wolbachia. We used
both Next-Gen-DNA sequencing and PCR tools to look for infections but did not find any evidence within
Hemdeina crassidens or two other Hemideina species investigated. The data associated with this paper
can be found here: http://evolves.massey.ac.nz/DNA_Toolkit.htm. As we cannot reference the paper in
review, we have referenced an MSc thesis that contains the majority of our findings relevant to this
species.
Please get in touch if further details are required. We look forward to hearing from you.
Yours truly,
Mary Morgan-Richards

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
Dear Authors,
I think the authors did a good job in incorporating most of my minor recommendations to improve their
MS.
Since my last review, I had an interesting discussion on their results with an entomologist friend of mine
(I am a botanist) by keeping all confidential information secure, we only discussed the brief content of
the MS. He pointed out that such mitho-nuclear discordance is commonplace if the population is infected
by Wolbachia bacteria -- that could easily explain why the authors find evidence for the co-existence of
different haplotypes within a single population (see e.g. Kodandaramaia et al. Ecol Evol. 3(16): 5167-
5176). This is a very likely way of how your insect can hold different haplotypes within a single
population. Please check carefully the review about Wolbachia infection here, Toews & Brelsford Mol.
Ecol. 21: 3907-3930. Unless you extensively disscuss why you can exclude the possibility of Wolbachia
infection for the currently observed pattern you need to test your samples if they are infected with
(different strains of) Wolbachia. But the possibility of Wolbachia-infection have to be included in the
Discussion at least. Otherwise, your paper can become an example of ignorance of such mitho-nuclear
discordence!
>Thank you for this suggestion. In our new revision we have now explicitly included the effect of
Wolbachia infections on mtNDA diversity (and added new references).
Lines 105-112; 146-149 in introduction.
We have explained that a separate study investigated the possibility of infection of Hemideina crassidens
by Wolbachia; although we recorded the first endemic New Zealand species’ infections we did not detect
the bacteria in Hemideina [http://evolves.massey.ac.nz/DNA_Toolkit.htm]. Thus our new mention of
Wolbachia in the discussion is brief (Lines 395-396).
