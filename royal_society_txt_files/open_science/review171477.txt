In this work, the authors report the preparation of amorphous GeOx particles through a simple
wet-chemistry reduction route at room temperature. Benefiting from the porous hierarchical
architecture, the GeOx anode exhibits a high reversible capacity over 400 mAh g-1, excellent rate
capability with a capacity of 200 mAh g-1 at 3.0 A g-1, and long-term cycling stability with 270
mAh g-1 even over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1. All in all, the results are quite interesting, and the
manuscript was carefully prepared. After minor revision suggested below, this manuscript can be
accepted for publication.
1. In order to better understand the superior cycling performance of the GeOx anode,
characterization of the cycled electrode material is necessary.
2. The authors are suggested to make an electrochemical performance comparison between the
as-prepared GeOx and previously reported Ge-based materials.
3. In the Introduction, some related papers can be considered, such as J. Phys. Chem. C 2014, 118,

This paper describes the production amorphous mesoporous GeOx and evaluates their
performance as anode for sodium ion battery. The preparation procedure and mechanism are
well demonstrated. The morphology, structure, as well as the electrochemical performances of
the as-prepared material have been thoroughly characterized. Consequently, this paper is
suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science after addressing the following minor issues

listed as follows:
1. Page 1, first paragraph, line 3 ‘paly’.
2. Page 1, first paragraph, the poor Na ion storage performance may not be the reason of
interlayer spacing mismatching. It’s the graphitic lattice mismatch. Remove ref 11 and 12, cite the
following paper here for correct explanation. Journal of Power Sources 243 (2013) 585
3. Figure 1, it is better to add labels in both a) and b), as well as indicate the composition of the
solution in the caption.
4. Figure 2, it would be better to indicate the air atmosphere of the TGA test in the caption.
5. Why is the voltage range different in Figure 4a and 4c? Please give plausible explanation.
6. For anodes, the charge capacity is more important, please include the charge capacities in
Figure 4d.
7. It can be clearly seen from Figure 4b that the Coulombic efficiency is not very high until about
40 cycles. So it should be mentioned in the main text that it requires tens of cycles for the
formation of good SEI layer.

Appendix A
Dear editors and reviewers:
Thanks for your decision letter and the reviewers’ comments concerning our manuscript
entitled "Amorphous mesoporous GeOx anode for Na-ion batteries with high
capacity and long life-span". Those comments are valuable and very helpful for
improving the paper. We have studied comments carefully and have made corrections
as possible as we can. The main corrections in the manuscript and the responses to the
reviewers’ comments are as followed:
Responds to the comments
Referee: 1
1. In order to better understand the superior cycling performance of the GeOx anode,
characterization of the cycled electrode material is necessary.
Respond: Thank you for your suggestion. Due to the limit of equipment, that we do
not have access to in-situ equipment like XRD, TEM and XPS, we could only use ex-
situ SEM to characterize the electrodes. And the results of SEM cannot show strong
evidence for the electrochemical testing results. Figure R1 are the characterization
results before and after cycling.
Figure R1. the SEM image of (a) amorphous GeOx electrode before cycling, (b)
amorphous GeOx electrode after cycling, (c) annealed GeOx (Ge/GeO2) electrode
before cycling and (d) annealed GeOx (Ge/GeO2) electrode after cycling
2. The authors are suggested to make an electrochemical performance comparison
between the as-prepared GeOx and previously reported Ge-based materials.
Respond: Thank you for your suggestion. In the introduction part of the manuscript,
we have covered many previously reported Ge-based materials and showed their
electrochemical performance.
3. In the Introduction, some related papers can be considered, such as J. Phys. Chem. C
2014, 118, 28502-28508, J. Phys. Chem. C 2015, 119, 5848-5854, Chem. Mater. 2015,
27, 8138-8145, and J. Mater. Chem. A 2017, 5, 13411-13420.
Respond: Thank you for your suggestion. All of these four papers have been added to
the references since they are representative and pioneering.
Referee: 2
1. Page 1, first paragraph, line 3 ‘paly’.
Respond: Thank you for pointing out our typo and we have corrected it.
2. Page 1, first paragraph, the poor Na ion storage performance may not be the reason
of interlayer spacing mismatching. It’s the graphitic lattice mismatch. Remove ref 11
and 12, cite the following paper here for correct explanation. Journal of Power Sources
243 (2013) 585
Respond: Thank you for your suggestion. We have removed Reference 11, 12, and
cited the mentioned paper.
3. Figure 1, it is better to add labels in both a) and b), as well as indicate the composition
of the solution in the caption.
Respond: Thank you for your suggestion. We have added the labels in both a) and b)
of figure 1 as well as in the caption.
4. Figure 2, it would be better to indicate the air atmosphere of the TGA test in the
caption.
Respond: Thank you for your suggestion. We have now clearly indicated the air
atmosphere of TGA test in the caption.
5. Why is the voltage range different in Figure 4a and 4c? Please give plausible
explanation.
Respond: Thank you for your question. We found that the capacity contribution is very
little while the voltage is between 2.0V and 2.5V. The charging and discharging curves
are very steep in that range. And to show the featured area more clearly, we just
conducted the test in the voltage range of 0.01-2V.
6. For anodes, the charge capacity is more important, please include the charge
capacities in figure 4d.
Respond: Thank you for your suggestion. We have included the charge capacities in
figure 4d (figure R2).
Figure R2. The Na ion storage performance of the GeOx electrode. (a) The
discharge/charge voltage profiles, and (b) cycling performance at 0.05 A g-1. (c) The
discharge/charge voltage profiles, and (d) cycling performance at the current density
ranging from 0.05 to 3.0 A g-1. (e) The long-term cycling properties at 1.0 A g-1.
7. It can be clearly seen from Figure 4b that the Coulombic efficiency is not very high
until about 40 cycles. So it should be mentioned in the main text that it requires tens of
cycles for the formation of good SEI layer.
Respond: Thank you for your suggestion. We have mentioned that in the explanation
of figure 4b in our manuscript.
Thanks for the referees’ and editor’s attention to our manuscript and we would like to
appreciate your professional suggestions. If you have any questions, please do not
hesitate to contact us at any time.
Best wishes.
Yours sincerely
