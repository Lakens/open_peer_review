Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
I have a large number of comments and suggestions, but these are all cosmetic. The basic and
very interesting conclusion is that chromatic discrimination thresholds depend upon chromatic
contrast between the stimuli and background. The prediction on lines 478-479 are excellent and
reasonable in spite of some of the problems with the dataset (figure 6). This is a very important
result and prediction so please follow my suggestions below, which will make the paper clearer
and stronger, and less speculative.
Page 5, lines 105, This is probably a silly question but do you think that doing the experiments in
winter may have resulted in a different result than if you had done them in the spring or
summer? I realise that the birds were probably kept indoors, but if there are any windows the
photoperiod may have affected general light adaptation and behaviour. It would in fact be
interesting to compare the results of the experiments in February with those in April–significantly
different photoperiod if there are any windows in the aviary and/or experimental room.There
are so many changes from winter to spring in birds that this may also affect their visual system
indirectly through physiology and endocrinology as well as direct effects on light adaptation in
winter versus spring. This is not a criticism of this paper, just a little worry if not a suggestion of
some possible future work.
Figure 1 caption. You said that the arena rested on “grey” boards. Did you measure the
reflectance spectra of this “grey”? Almost everything made for human vision is strongly
absorbant in the UV, so in fact the boards may not have been gray to the birds. What was the
illumination? If little UV in the light, then a UV-absorbing “grey” would not matter. Of course
the monitor doesn’t produce UV, so maybe this doesn’t matter.
Line 140-142. Why were the stimuli so big? 4cm diameter is very much larger than the normal
food eaten by finches or colour patches on their heads. In fact it is almost as big as the birds.
Why didn’t you use a smaller size, for example the same size as a zebra finch’s cheek patch if you
are interested in sexual selection? Some justification is needed here.
Lines 145-146, background radiance. What was the acceptance angle of the sensor, or, did you
have it calibrated in micro moles m^-2 nm^-1 steradian^-1? The latter would be best for proper
calculations. Why did you aim it at 60 degrees? Is that the average gaze angle of the birds
towards the monitor RNL in the experimental chamber?
Equation 2 and lines 171-176. It would be more in keeping with physics if you used Q for quanta
of radiance and irradiance rather than S for quantum flux, and even more confusing (to people
with physics background) to use Q for quantum catch rer. It is also annoying that almost every
new paper on RNL uses different symbols for the same units (and that includes subsequent
papers by Voroybev and Osorio!). I personally think that one should use C and c for quanta
captures to avoid confusion with quantal irradiance and radiance.
I also think it would be very helpful to specify the units of what you call r, p, o, R, S and Q. Most
papers are really sloppy about this.
3
Equation 7, you should probably cite the Osorio and Voroybev paper for this equation.
Lines 214-219. Please say how long (mean +/- SD) it took to train the birds (days) and do each
trial (hours/minutes).
Figure 2, the radiance spectra answer my question about UV–there appears to be none, so even if
the “gray” abosorbs UV it will not matter. It might be worth saying this where my question came
up.
Figure 2 caption “The variation in UVS cone is negligible and not shown”. You may want to
modify this to say “The mean and variation in the UVS cone is negligable and not shown”. It is
important that the UVS cone is hardly stimulated at all. “It is assumed that the receptors are
adapted to the gray background”, but I cannot tell if this is true because you did not give the
acceptance angle of the radiance sensor. If it was narrower than the birds field of view then it
will give a false background spectrum because it did not include the rest of the chamber that also
affects the birds eyes during the trial. Please clarify this. I like the idea of the inset to avoid
crowding but it would be still better if you could simply give an enlargement of all the points
near the neutral point.
Lines 220-221. Please define what you mean by “properly”, or, define the criteria for when the
birds were “unmotivated” or failed to do the task “properly”. This is a bit vague.
Lines 236-243. How did you control for order effects in the order of colours every bird
experienced? There are a lot of experiments showing that extensive experience with one colour
significantly affects choice of other colours in both positive and negative ways, depending upon
the perceptual differences between them. I am a little worried by the apparent fact that you are
using the same colour sequence for each bird, rather than randomising the order as in hundreds
of other animal (and human) behaviour experiments.
Line 249-251. Please define what you mean by a Michelson contrast (give the formula for
calculating it)–this will not be familiar to the majority of readers of the journal. Please justify the
use of 16 29 35% and also why 29% is repeated on line 251.
Line 253, birds pairs assigned one of the background randomly. This partially gets at my
question of order effects, but does not answer the problem of the stimulus order effect on lines
236-243.
Line 268. Please justify the choice of 6.8 or 4.8 JNDs. A lot of the experimental design seems
highly arbitrary with no justification.
Line 279. Why did you set the threshold to 66.7%? Another instance of what seems a totally
aribtrary choice of experimental design. These numbers need justification. I like the use of fitting
a psychometric function to the data but I do not understand why you used 66.7%
Figure 3. I am amazed by the individual variation among birds in discrimination thresholds!
As I mentioned before, how does this relate to the date of the test? But what is really worrying is
that 3 birds had a lower threshold for a lower contrast (negative slope on your
graph). On the other hand the points do not have confidence limits or SD so in fact it may
well be that changes in discrimination thresholds of less than 0.5 JND are meaningless. But, if
that were true then maybe only one bird showed a significant relationship between background
contrast and discrimination threshold. This is a general limitation to estimation of JNDs rather
than any fault in the experimental design. But this problem does need to be discussed. In other
words, just how seriously are we to take the changes in thresholds?
4
Figure 3 caption. Why in the world did you specify background luminance in candelas per m^2?!
Utterly irrelevant to vision except for humans. It must be specified as quanta and definitely not
something dependent upon human vision.
Line 317. Just what do you mean by “dimmer”? Less radiant? Less reflective? And also just
what do you mean by “cromaticity”? Distance from the neutral point in the tetrahedron or some
other measure?
Figure 4. Once again I am rather worried by the amazing variation among birds. Again, does the
variation for a particular background contrast vary with Julian date? On the other hand the
worst variation is for the yellow background which may be the most unrealistic natural
background. In their natural habitat Zebra finches live on areas with lots of reddish soil and
other places with light gray soil. Yellow would not be experience, and green is rare except in the
few wetter parts of their distribution. Moreover, all the natural backgrounds are UV rich, so all
colours may appear odd to the birds. Still, it is interesting that the best results are for the red
background, a natural (if much more chromatic) background. On the other hand the long
training with reds in the training schedule may have predisposed them to work better with reds.
Unfortunately, since you didn’t train them on, say, green on gray, we have no way to
discriminate between these two hypotheses. Also worth discussion.
Figure 4, caption. Again the nonsensical use of human-vision-based cd/m^2.
Figure 5. It is very interesting that some birds showed what appears to be a threshold and others
showed a gradual change with JNDs. The location of the “threshold” for panels C D, E and G is
nonsense; there are no signs of thresholds there. Instead refer to the red bars as the 50% value or
some other less-misleading term.
Line 367, “a noise level of 0.1 in the LWS cone”. The literature is very confused about noise levels
and weber fractions. Just what does 0.1 refer to here? Does it refer to the Weber fraction (omega,
another laughable symbol since it is the Greek letter equivalent to the latin O, but looks like a
latin W)? Or does it refer to the numerator of the Weber fraction (nu), or does it refer to
something else. Please be more careful with terminology. And what did you use for the “noise
levels” (omegas?) for the other cones?
Line 386. If I remember correctly it also applies to sound and possibly olfaction. (Not necessary
to say this here, unless you want to).
Lines 386-388. This might simply be a result of chromatic adaptation to the background, not
requiring any fancy retinal or brain integration. There is a huge literature on this subsumed
under the term “colour constancy”. You almost allude to this below on lines 418-422. You could
get at this by varying the vonKries correction using the background radiance. Again my
comment about the acceptance angle of your radiance sensor.
Lines 413-414. Your comments about large objects prompts me to bring up the excessively large
size of your stimuli. I wonder what would have happened if you had used more naturalistic
stimuli sizes, either that of facial colour patches (communication) or seeds.
Lines 427-428. Actually the data show that only some colours are placed in categories; as I
mentioned before, there is no evidence for categories for panels C D E and G in figure 5.
Figure 6 is excellent in showing the minimum at about 1JND. However that argument is rather
arbitrary and tautological since you chose a weber fraction of 0.1 based on discrimination. Still, it
5
is in line with other studies using 0.1. There is a more serious problem in that the regression lines
may be an artifact of the two points at 18, with no
points in between these and the others. Also there are two points left out. The real worry with
these two thresholds with no background contrast is that it suggests that all points at about 3
JNDs and below are perceived the same and as noise (type I statistical error, or false positives in
the signal detection literature). Consequently it looks like you have a cloud of points at the noise
level below background contrast of about 7 and only two points at 18, which is a very poor way
to get a relationship. This would be taken more seriously had you had many points between 8
and 18. Consequently the rank speculation on lines 471-477 is unjustified, or needs to be made
with a lot more caution.

label_comment_2
This is a very interesting study and the first I know to look at discrimination of colours
presenting large contrasts with the background. As far as I can tell the work although somewhat
preliminary has been done well and the basic findings are sound and important. At present the
article is not suitable for publication for various reasons.
1. The prose is full of minor errors, several of which I have corrected on the attached PDF. (See
Appendix A.)
2. The figures are quite difficult to read.
3. The findings should be more carefully related to the predictions of Fechners law, with some
discussion of human performance if not in colour then in other sensory tasks.By comparison a
good deal is made of the Dipper function. This would be fine of the effect were convincing, but as
presented the evidence needs to be explained better (e.g. on Figure 4) and supported by statistical
evidence.
Overall careful revision and focus would greatly benefit this work.

25 Abstract
5 There is today good knowledge of the physiological basis of bird colour vision and how
6
7 mathematical models can be used to predict visual thresholds. Still, we know little about
8
9 how colour vision changes between different viewing conditions. This limits the
10
11 understanding of how colour signalling is configured in habitats where the light
12 30 conditions may shift dramatically. I examined how colour discrimination in the zebra
13
14 finch (Taeniopygia guttata) is affected by adaptation to different background colours. I
15
16 trained finches in a two-alternative choice task, to choose between red discs displayed on
17
18 backgrounds with different colours. I found that discrimination thresholds correlate with
19 stimulus contrast to the background. Thresholds are low, and in agreement with model
20
21 35 predictions, for a background with a red colour similar to the colour of the discs. For the
22
23 most contrasting green background, thresholds are about five times higher than this.
24
25
Subsequently, I train the finches for the detection of single discs on a grey background.
26 Detection thresholds are about 2.5 to 3 times higher than discrimination thresholds. This
27
28 study demonstrates close similarities in human and bird colour vision, and the
29
30 40 quantitative data offer a new possibility to account for shifting viewing conditions in
31
colour vision models.

Introduction
5
6
7 50 Many animals use colourful ornaments as signals to attract the opposite sex during mate
8
9 choice. How such colour traits emerge, and how trait variation is maintained, are core
10
11 questions for evolutionary biology [1,2]. In this context, birds are a central taxon with
12 studies of numerous aspects of feather colouration [3]. Unfortunately, plumage colours
13
14 cannot be fully appreciated by human perception as we have very different colour vision
15
16 55 compared to birds [4]. Instead we must use mathematical models, developed from an
17
18 understanding of the physiological basis of colour vision, to represent the bird view of
19 colours.
20
21 The bird retina has four spectrally distinct cone photoreceptors that mediate
22
23 tetrachromatic colour vision; the UVS/VS (ultraviolet or violet-sensitive), the SWS (short
24
25
60 wavelength-sensitive), the MWS (medium wavelength-sensitive), and the LWS (long
26 wavelength-sensitive) cone [5]. There are also double cones and rods that are used for
27
28 brightness and spatial vision (but not colour vision) in bright and dim light respectively.
29
30 Birds do not only have more cone types than humans (that are trichromats), but the
31
cones have also a different morphology as they are equipped with carotenoid-pigmented
32
33 65 oil droplets at the distal end of the inner segments. Such oil droplet exists in all cones,
34
35 but not in rods. In UVS/VS cones, the oil droplets are not pigmented [5]. The oil
36
37 droplets filter incident light before it reaches the visual pigments and alter cone
38 sensitivity, which is believed to improve spectral resolution and colour constancy at the
39
40 cost of a lower absolute sensitivity [6-8].
41
42 70 Careful descriptions of cone sensitivities are fundamental to colour vision models.
43
44 Another requirement is the validation of model predictions by behavioural data on visual
45 performance. Today, the most popular model of animal colour vision is the receptor
46
47 noise-limited (RNL) model proposed by Vorobyev and Osorio, [9]. This model agrees
48
49 well with behavioural data on spectral sensitivity in red-billed leiothrix and budgerigars
50
51
75 [9-11], as well as the discrimination of reflecting object colours in domestic chicks [12].
52 However, to explore colour vision in a natural context, such as the perception of colour
53
54 traits displayed in a habitat of variable vegetation, the models need to account for the
55
56 effect of photoreceptor adaptation to the visual background. To this date, this has been a
57
58
considerable limitation for the use of the RNL model.
59 80 From studies on human vision it is clear that colour discrimination changes when
60
the photoreceptors are adapted to different backgrounds. Thresholds are low when
 3 
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 4 of 26
1
2
3 discrimination is made between stimuli with colours similar to the adaptive background,
4
5 and higher if the stimuli and the background are more different [13,14]. This effect could
6
7 have far reaching consequences for how animal colour vision and colour signalling are
8
9 85 configured and understood. Coloured feathers are often strongly contrasting the
10 background, which makes them conspicuous. Similarly, fruits are usually clearly distinct
11
12 from the surrounding vegetation when ripe [15]. How well can birds discern the variation
13
14 among such traits?
15
16
In this study, I used behavioural experiments to test how colour discrimination
17 90 relates to background adaptation in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Male zebra finches
18
19 have red beaks that are used as a sexual signal during mate choice [16]. Females prefer
20
21 males that have more red beaks, but also red leg rings [17,18]. I exploited this seemingly
22
23
general colour preference by training female zebra finches to discriminate between red
24 colour discs of different saturation displayed on backgrounds with different colour and
25
26 95 brightness.

7 Animals
8
9 I used six adult female zebra finches identified as b12, b35, w51, w60, y77, and y82. The
10
11 experiments were carried out at Lund University field station (Stensoffa) between
12 105 February and April 2016. I trained and tested birds during the weekdays and on these
13
14 days, birds were only fed in the experiments except for a small portion of millet seeds
15
16 that was given in the evening. Food was available ad libitum during weekends, and water
17
18 was freely accessible. I kept birds in pairs in adjacent cages under a 14L/10D light regime
19 with daylight at approximately 400 lux. The experiments were approved by the Malmö-
20
21 110 Lund Animal Ethics Committee (M 41-15).

Apparatus
26 I tested birds in a plastic-glass arena (Fig. 1) that was built from 3 mm thick diffusing
27
28 glass (polymethyl acrylate, Biltema, Lund, Sweden), and 2 mm clear glass (Styrene
29
30 115 Acrylonitrile, Biltema, Lund, Sweden). Birds waited inside “house-boxes” (150 mm
31
width, 150 mm length, 100 mm height) made out of diffusing glass at the bottom, back

55
56 floor on the monitor. An extra layer of clear glass protected the monitor from
57 mechanical damage when the diffusing glass was removed for cleaning. Two tubes
58 (only one shown), was used to deliver seeds from the wheel to the left or the right
59 side of the stimulus-box. Transparent doors closed the house-boxes, but could be
60 open by an attachment (only one shown) to a wheel similar to that used for feeding.

3 and sides, and clear glass at the top and the front that faced the “stimulus-box” (Fig. 1).
4
5 Birds accessed the stimulus-box through openings in the front glass that could be shut by
6
7 clear glass-doors, which were slid vertically using DC motors (Dynamixel AX-12,
8
9 120 Robotis, Seoul, South Korea). The stimulus-box (180 mm width, 150 mm length, 120
10 mm height) was made out of diffusing glass on the sides and clear glass at the top. The
11
12 floor of the stimulus-box was diffusing glass (300 mm width, 600 mm length) places on a
13
14 horizontally placed monitor (32WL30MS, LG, Seoul, South Korea). The outer parts of
15
16
the housing-boxes rested on grey board so that the whole arena was held 20 mm above
17 125 the diffusing glass floor. This arrangement allowed the diffusing glass to be cleaned from
18
19 seeds regularly by blowing in air from the side. Between sessions, I could remove both
20
21 the arena and the diffusing glass floor and rinse them when needed.
22
23
Grey wood-boards covered the monitor at the sides of the arena, and the whole
24 arena was flanked by black curtains (Fig. 1), so that all light entering the boxes came
25
26 130 from directly below. The apparatus was placed in a dark room with the computer screen
27
28 held at the dimmest level (radiance from the stimulus background with the monitor off
29
was less than 0.01 cd/m2).
30
31 Two feeder tubes connected to feeder wheels entered the stimulus-box at each side.
32
33 Following correct answers, a DC motor (same as above) turned the feeder-wheel so that
34
35 135 3-6 millet seeds entered the feeder tube and dropped at the stimulus-box floor close to
36 the rewarded stimulus. I controlled the screen and the motors by custom-written
37
38 software written in matlab (R2014b, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). All scripts are
39
40 available on request.
41
42
43 140 Stimuli
44
45 Stimuli were uniformly coloured discs with a diameter of 40 mm, and a centre-to-centre
46
47 distance of 85 mm, displayed on the monitor at the middle of the stimulus-box (Fig. 1).
48
49
The edges of the discs were made diffuse by the transmission through the diffusing glass
50 floor (Fig. 1). Discs were visible for 5 seconds after a correct choice, or disappearing
51
52 145 immediately after incorrect choices. I measured stimulus and background radiance with a
53
54 spectroradiometer (ILT950, International Light Technologies, Peabody, MA, USA) at
55
several angles, at both sides of the stimulus-box, and both at the beginning and at the
56
57 end of the experiments. I found only negligible variation between these measurements,
58
59 and used an average for both sides, taken at an angle of approximately 60 degrees at the
60
150 end of the experiments for further analysis. Moreover, I measured radiance without the

9 Modelling colour contrast
10 155 I used the receptor noise-limited (RNL) model to calculate colour contrast [9]. Below are
11
12 the equations used for the calculations, while a detailed model description can be found
13
14 elsewhere [4,9].
15
16
17 The sensitivity, R, of a photoreceptor is:
18
19 160 
20
21 <U+0001D445>! <U+0001D706> = <U+0001D45F>! <U+0001D706> <U+0001D45D>! <U+0001D706> <U+0001D45C> <U+0001D706> , (1)
22
23
24 where r is the spectral sensitivity of the visual pigment in receptor i (i = UVS, SWS,
25
26 MWS, LWS), p is oil droplet transmittance and o is ocular media transmittance. Visual
27
28 165 pigment sensitivity was estimated using the Govardovskii template [19], and oil droplets
29
30
were modelled as cut-off filters [20], together with data from microspectrophotometry
31 [21]. Data on ocular media transmittance was taken from [22]. I assume that self-
32
33 screening of the visual pigment is negligible [23]. Data on cone sensitivities are given in
34
35 the electronic supplementary material.

26
27 where v is the noise-to-signal ratio of an individual cone and <U+03B7> is the number of this cone
28 type per receptive field (cone abundance). I used a Weber fraction of 0.1 in the LWS
29
30 mechanism, which is the noise estimate for Red-billed leiothrix and Budgerigar in earlier
31
32 studies of spectral sensitivity thresholds [11,24] a cone abundance ratio of 1:1.5:2:3 [21].
33

Birds were trained and tested in pairs. Each pair was adapted to the experimental
59 conditions for 5 minutes in the house-boxes before training or tests commenced. At the
60
very first arena encounters, birds were freely exploring the boxes, with millet seeds

4
5 215 the stimulus-box separately, eat from the millet seeds at the rewarded stimulus, and
6
7 return to the house-box to initiate new trials. In the following training, birds were
8
9 required to choose the rewarded stimulus to receive the food reward, and the choices
10 were recorded. Birds were tested for 5 trials before the other bird in the pair was tested
11
12 under the same conditions, and all trials could be observed by the waiting bird. Sessions

45 backgrounds (a,c), and the discs (c,d). The positions of colour loci depend on their
46 relative excitation of the SWS, MWS, and LWS cones. The variation in UVS cone is
47 negligible and not shown. The relative positions of the background colours are shown in
48
(a). It is assumed that receptors are adapted to the grey background that therefore is
49
50 position at the neutral point in the diagram centre. In (b), background spectra are; red
51 (red line), medium red (dashed red line), yellow (yellow line), grey (thick black line), and
52 green background (green dotted line). Colour loci of discs (c) are colour coded according
53 to which background they appear on. Receptor adaptation (Eq. 3) brings the background
54 colour to the neutral point so that the relative positions of the disc colour loci shift. The
55 insert in (c) shows the loci for discs on the medium red background to avoid crowding in
56
57
the main diagram. Disc colour spectra (d), were always the same, except for a small “red
58 tint” to the unsaturated disc used in the detection task (grey circle in (c) and line in (d). In
59 (d), the saturation of the red colours of the discs correlates with decreasing amplitude in
60 the spectra at 550 nm, and the thick red line indicates the reinforces disc colour. Data on
colour spectra are given in the electronic supplementary material.

3 220 comprised between 10 and 50 trials and were ended when any of the birds became
4
5 unmotivated, or otherwise failed to carry out the task properly. In total, I ran 2-4 sessions
6
7 each day and rearranged pairs so that birds at the same level of progress were matched to
8
9 advance training efficiently.
10 Trials started with a three-tick auditory signal together with the presentation of the
11
12 225 stimuli. After three seconds, I opened the transparent door and the bird entered the
13
14 stimulus-box and made a choice by turning towards either of the discs. The stimuli were
15
16
hidden to me as I was operating the computer behind the black curtain (Fig. 1), but I
17 could see the upper parts of the arena and track the movement of the bird. I entered the
18
19 choice (left or right side) into matlab, where pre-set scripts recorded the data, determined
20
21 230 if the correct stimulus was chosen (this was blind to me) and if so, immediately delivered
22
23
a food reward. For incorrect choices, a low frequency sound was played and the stimuli
24 were removed. In both cases, the bird returned into the house-box to initiate a new trial.
25
26 For the discrimination series 1, I first trained birds to choose between a rewarded
27
28 red disc and a non-rewarded grey disc (contrast, 6.9 JNDs) on a grey background. The
29
235 criterion for completing this training was at least 80% correct choices during 40
30
31 consecutive trials. At training level 2, birds were trained with the red disc, but now the
32
33 grey disc was replaced by a non-rewarded red-tinted disc (contrast, 3.7 JNDs) on the
34
35 same grey background. By the same criterion, birds were advanced to train on
36 backgrounds with yellow and green colour. On these backgrounds, I showed the bird the
37
38 240 same rewarded red disc together with either the grey, or the red-tinted discs, both
39
40 occurring randomly but at the same average frequency. For this generalization training,
41
42 and for all subsequent training, birds completed training by a less stringent criterion of at
43 least 80% correct choices during 20 consecutive trials.
44
45 When all training was completed, I tested the birds on the grey, yellow, green, and a
46
47 245 brighter variant of the grey background. The rewarded stimulus was always the highly
48
49
saturated red disc, while the non-rewarded alternative was a disc chosen at random from
50 a series of differently saturated discs ranging from grey to red at contrasts of 0.1, 0.6, 2.1,
51
52 3.7, 5.2, and 6.9 JNDs (Fig. 2). All stimuli were balanced for approximately equal
53
54 intensity for double cones, with Michelson contrasts of less than 4% (I will always report
55
250 Michelson contrast in terms of double cone contrast). The rewarded disc was brighter
56
57 than the background with a Michelson contrast of 29%, 35%, 29%, and 16% for the
58
59 grey, yellow, green, and bright grey backgrounds respectively.

3 In tests, bird pairs were assigned one of the backgrounds randomly each day, and no
4
5 background was tested over two consecutive days (except when all tests at other
6
7 255 backgrounds were completed). At the beginning of each session, each bird received 5
8
9 “instruction” trials at the strongest contrast (6.9 JNDs) that were not recorded.
10 The position of the rewarded stimulus (left or right) was determined following a
11
12 randomly assembly of Fellows-series [25] while avoiding more than 4 rewarded
13
14 repetitions at any side. Schedules were pre-programmed in matlab and executed blind to
15
16
260 me during the experiments. Tests were completed when birds had made 30 choices for
17 each contrast at each of the four backgrounds.
18
19 In discrimination series 2, birds were first trained to discriminate between the discs
20
21 displayed on a saturated red background with the same chromaticity, but dimmer
22
23
(Michelson contrast of 25%) than the rewarded disc (Fig. 2). As this training failed (see
24 265 results), I re-trained the birds on a dim (Michelson contrast of 28%) “medium red”
25
26 background that was less saturated than the rewarded disc (Fig. 2).
27
28 In the detection series, birds were trained to detect a single disc with a contrast of
29
either 6.8 or 4.8 JNDs against a background with the colour used for the completely
30
31 unsaturated grey colour stimulus in the previous experiments. In tests, the rewarded
32
33 270 stimuli were all the non-rewarded stimuli used in the earlier tests, except for a slight
34
35 LWS-cone contrast added to the most unsaturated colour (Fig. 2A,C). The contrasts
36 between this saturation series and the grey background were 1.0, 1.7, 3.1, 4.8, 6.3, and 6.8
37
38 JNDs.
39
40 After the completion of test series 3, birds were immediately tested, without training,
41
42 275 for the detection of grey discs that were dimmer than the grey background at Michelson
43 contrasts of 1.7%, 5.4%, 12%, 23%, 40%, and 59%.

I assume that the data follow a binomial distribution and set the threshold to 66.7%
50 280 correct choices (one-tailed binomial distribution, n=30, p < 0.05). This threshold was
51
52 interpolated from a logistic psychometric function fitted to the data:

the upper asymptote and 1 (allowed to vary between 0 and 0.25), and a and b are

9 295 All birds successfully passed training on the grey, yellow and green backgrounds, except
10
11 one bird that failed to complete training level 2 on the grey background (S2, electronic
12
13 supplementary material). I decided to use this bird as company for other birds in the
14 tests, thus carry out all procedures but ignoring the results.
15
16 I tested birds on grey, bright grey, yellow, and green backgrounds. First, I compared
17
18 300 the thresholds obtained for the grey backgrounds of different intensity, but this
19
20 achromatic shift did not cause any change of discrimination thresholds (Fig. 3).
21 Despite being successful in training (S2, electronic supplementary material), two
22
23 birds (w60 and b35) failed to produce any correct choice frequencies significantly above
24
25 random level in the tests on the green background (Fig. 4). For the yellow background,
26
27
305 one bird (w51) performed poorly (S5, electronic supplementary material), and a
28 meaningful psychometric function could not be fitted to the data. Instead, the threshold
29
30 was set to the highest contrast of 6.9 JNDs, which was the only level that gave significant
31
32 choice behaviour.
33
34
The thresholds for discrimination series 1 correlate positively with background
35 310 contrast in three birds, y82, y77, and w60. Thus, thresholds are lowest for the yellow,
36
37 intermediate for the grey, and highest for the green background (Fig. 4). For the other
38
39 two birds, w51 and b35, thresholds are lowest on the grey background, and higher on
40
both the yellow and the green backgrounds (Fig. 4).

11 In the tests of chromatic detection, only one disc was displayed and treated as the
12 rewarded stimulus during each trial. One bird, w51, was taken out form the experiments
13
14 330 because of stress symptoms. Another bird, w60, was poorly motivated at this stage of
15
16 testing, and kept only as company for b35 during the remaining trials. Among the three
17
18 remaining birds, y77 and y82 immediately completed training during the first 20 trials,
19 while b35 was ready for the tests after roughly 100 trials. In the tests, all three birds
20
21 performed excellent at trials with high contrast stimuli, with correct choice frequencies
22
23 335 about 90% (Fig. 5a,e). Detection thresholds are between 2.5 and 3.2 JNDs, thus higher

than the lowest discrimination thresholds buy a factor of approximately 2.5-3 (Fig. 4).

345 Discussion
5
6
7 The results in this study show that in zebra finches, just like in humans [13], chromatic
8
9
discrimination thresholds depend on the chromatic contrast between the stimuli and the
10 background. Another shared characteristic is that thresholds are higher for the detection,
11
12 350 compared to the discrimination of chromatic contrast. The details of these findings, and
13
14 their importance for the ecology and evolution of bird colour vision are discussed below.
15
16
17 Discrimination thresholds and the “dipper function”
18
19 At large, I conclude that colour discrimination thresholds increase when stimuli have a
20
21 355 stronger contrast to the background (Fig. 4). For two of the birds (w51, b35), this
22 relationship is confounded by high discrimination thresholds for the yellow background
23
24 (Fig. 4). Despite their successful training, and the instruction trials given at the beginning
25
26 of each session, these two birds may have been confused by the background shifts.
27
28 Alternatively, the thresholds of these two birds are truly higher for the yellow compared
29 360 to the grey background. However, there are no obvious explanations for such a
30
31 difference. The yellow background was included in the tests to examine in there is a
32
33 different between a shift in receptor adaptation co-linear to the variation in saturation of
34
35
the stimulus discs (green, grey, medium red backgrounds), and an shift in hue,
36 orthogonal to saturation (yellow background). Unfortunately, this issue cannot be
37
38 365 resolved with the large spread of behavioural responses for the yellow background (Fig.
39
40 4).
41
42
In agreement with the RNL model and a noise level of 0.1 in the LWS cone
43 mechanisms, the lowest discrimination threshold is very close to 1 JND (Figs. 4, 5F).
44
45 This threshold was not found in the detection task, carried out at the background
46
47 370 chromaticity, but for the discrimination between stimuli with modest contrast against the
48
background (Figs. 4, 5ABEF). This causes a “dip” in the function that describes
49
50 thresholds as a function of background contrast.
51
52 The “dipper function” is well described in human colour vision, where it appears in
53
54 the use of stimulus “pedestals” [27,28]. A pedestal is an achromatic or chromatic contrast
55 375 against the background that is shared by, and usually has the same spatial and temporal
56
57 properties, as the stimuli. For example, the task may be to discriminate between two
58
59 colour stimuli of the same brightness, where one of them has the same chromaticity as
60
the background and therefore cannot be distinguished. In this case, the task is a matter of
 16 
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 17 of 26 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 detecting a chromaticity shift from the background. However, if the stimuli retain their
4
5 380 chromaticity but are placed on luminance pedestals, meaning that they are given a shared
6
7 achromatic contrast against the background, they are both distinct and the detection task
8
9 becomes a discrimination task.
10 Several studies on humans have shown that thresholds first decrease as pedestal
11
12 contrast is raised slightly above zero, then increases as pedestal grows even stronger,
13
14 385 hence the threshold “dip”. The dipper function is not specific to colour vision, but
15
16
occurs also in other visual modalities such as spatial contrast discrimination [29]. Why
17 pedestals facilitate contrast detection is still not clear but it has been suggested that the
18
19 demarcation of the stimuli aid retinal integration or neuronal gain mechanisms [28, 30].
20
21 For the zebra finches, the pedestals were composed of a stable achromatic contrast
22
23
390 together with a variable chromatic contrast. Just as for human, thresholds decrease with
24 a modest level of pedestal contrast, but increases again when the chromatic contrast of
25
26 the pedestals continues to increase (Fig. 4). In one case, background intensity was raised
27
28 to decrease achromatic pedestal contrast, but this did not affect discrimination thresholds
29
(Fig. 3). Again, this is a parallel to human colour vision where any small amount of
30
31 395 pedestal contrast facilitate discrimination, but where stronger pedestal contrast has little
32
33 effect unless it has the same modality (achromatic or chromatic) as the stimulus variation.
34
35 This is very useful for the design of colour vision tests since chromatic stimuli can be
36 placed upon achromatic pedestals in order to disfavour the use of achromatic cues.
37
38 Besides the spatial tuning of colour vision [31], the correlation between
39
40 400 discrimination thresholds and background contrast and the presence of the dipper
41
42 function in zebra finches, are additional examples of shared characteristics of colour
43 vision in mammals and birds despite their fundamentally different physiology.
44
45
46
47 Colour learning
48
49
405 To investigate discrimination thresholds at zero chromatic contrast against the
50 background, I trained birds for the discrimination between the stimuli on achromatic
51
52 pedestals displayed on a background with the same chromaticity as the rewarded stimulus
53
54 (Fig. 2). This training failed completely in all birds (S3, electronic supplementary
55
material).
56
57 410 The achromatic (Michelson) contrast between the rewarded stimulus and the red
58
59 background was 25%, which is well above roughly 10% brightness discrimination
60
threshold determined in other birds (see below). However, brightness vision has not
 17 
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 18 of 26
1
2
3 been tested in zebra finches, and the achromatic sensitivity may be very low for very
4
5 large objects [31]. If the zebra finches failed to detect the achromatic pedestals,
6
7 415 discrimination would be made between non-rewarded discs, and a rewarded alternative
8
9 with no contrast separation from the background. This task of choosing the side without
10 a disc may have been confusing.
11
12 Another possibility is that a complete adaptation to the background would shift the
13
14 colour of the rewarded stimulus into the neutral point of the chromaticity diagram.
15
16
420 Consequently, the task of discriminating discs in an LWS-dominated region would
17 become a matter of discriminating discs in an MWS-dominated region of colour space,
18
19 where the rewarded alternative is the most unsaturated alternative (Fig. 2). It is worth
20
21 noting that birds did not simply choose the most saturated colours as for this
22
23
background, this would give a preference for all but the rewarded discs and thus, very
24 425 few correct choices. However, the correct choice frequencies were not abnormally low,
25
26 but at random level even at the very first choices (S3, electronic supplementary material).
27
28 Instead, it appears that the shift confused the zebra finches because they learn colours by
29
some categorical identity. Although categorical concepts, like “red” and “green”, usually
30
31 are restricted to human perception, it has been shown that domestic chicks generalize
32
33 430 colours within categorical boundaries [32]. This study was not designed to investigate
34
35 colour learning, but the method of shifting colour identity by background adaptation and
36 test for colour preference may prove a useful technique to further explore generalization
37
38 and categorical boundaries in animal colour vision.
39
40
41
42 435 Achromatic contrast detection
43 In the last experiment, I found that birds did not generalize between chromatic and
44
45 achromatic detection (Fig. 5). For achromatic detection, one of three birds produced
46
47 choice frequencies above random level (Fig. 5D), and only with a poor performance that
48
49
resulted in a very high threshold of 29% Michelson contrast. This threshold is
50 440 substantially higher than the threshold for brightness discrimination in other bird species;
51
52 9% in budgerigars [33], and 13% in pigeons [34]. The zebra finches were not only
53
54 confused by the transition between the chromatic and the achromatic task, but there
55
were no signs of learning achromatic detection with better performance at late trials (S8,
56
57 electronic supplementary material). It has been claimed that for large static stimuli
58
59 445 displayed on a homogenous background, detection is mainly driven by chromatic vision
60
[9,11, 31]. The results are in line with this idea, and further suggest that in zebra finches,
 18 
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 19 of 26 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 a low sensitivity for achromatic contrast in large-field stimuli is coupled with a slow or
4
5 absent learning of such cues.
6

8
9 450 Colour thresholds and visual ecology
10 The understanding of receiver perception is central to studies of the ecology and the
11
12 evolution of sensory signals [35]. Here, the results on colour discrimination in zebra
13
14 finches have far reaching consequences for how we understand and model colour vision
15
16
and colour trait variation in birds.
17 455 First, the dipper function, the difference in thresholds between detection and
18
19 discrimination, demonstrates that the specific behaviour under investigated is crucial for
20
21 making accurate model predictions of colour vision performance. Interestingly,
22
23
thresholds are about 2-3 times higher for detection compared to discrimination in both
24 zebra finches and humans [27,28]. Hopefully, future investigations will clarify if a
25
26 460 difference of this magnitude is a general characteristic of colour vision in birds and
27
28 mammals.
29
Second, discrimination thresholds depend on the colour of the background. This
30
31 effect is not accounted for in the present version of the very popular RNL model [9]. For
32
33 the red beaks of male zebra finches, colour variation close to the threshold given by the
34
35 465 RNL model (1 JND) is meaningful only for a red background, and not for the more
36 natural backgrounds of brown and green vegetation.
37
38 Fortunately, it is possible to quantify these effects in order to calibrate the models.
39
40 In the two best-performing birds (y77 and y82), the lowest discrimination thresholds are
41
42 close to the limit predicted from the RNL model with a noise level of 0.1 in the LWS
43 470 cone mechanism. The increase in threshold at stronger background contrast is well

3 described by linear functions with practically identical slopes in both birds (Fig. 6). From
4
5 this, we can make predictions. For example, the contrast between the red beak of a zebra
6
7 finch and green vegetation is roughly 9.5 JNDs. At this level of background contrast, the
8
9 discrimination threshold is about 2.5 JNDS. The blue crest of a blue tit has a contrast of
10 475 about 12.5 JNDs against green vegetation, and thus a meaningful variation above 3.2
11
12 JNDs. This correction for background contrast could easily be incorporated into the
13
14 RNL model.
15

An exciting prediction that follows from these results is that the variation in colour
17 traits should be larger for traits that are more strongly contrasting the background. Small
18
19 480 variation in highly conspicuous traits is likely not detected by the observer unless the
20
21 colour traits are displayed in a position with a favourable background. Furthermore, this
22
23
may form a constraint in the evolution of highly saturated colour traits and help to
24 explain the global distribution of bird colours within the bird colour space [36].

28 485 Conclusions
29
This investigation of colour discrimination in zebra finches adds to a rapidly growing
30
31 body of research on how visual performance relates to receptor adaptation, including
32
33 studies on colour vision in dim light [12], spectral sensitivity [10, 11,37], and colour
34
35 constancy [38]. So far, we are only scratching the surface on this field of research and
36 490 more general unifying theories are missing. This offers exciting possibilities for future
37
38 research and the search for new insights into colour vision and colour signalling.

Response to Referees
Reviewer: 1
I have a large number of comments and suggestions, but these are all cosmetic. The
basic and very interesting conclusion is that chromatic discrimination thresholds depend
upon chromatic contrast between the stimuli and background. The prediction on lines
478-479 are excellent and reasonable in spite of some of the problems with the dataset
(figure 6). This is a very important result and prediction so please follow my suggestions
below, which will make the paper clearer and stronger, and less speculative.
Page 5, lines 105, This is probably a silly question but do you think that doing the
experiments in winter may have resulted in a different result than if you had done them
in the spring or summer? I realise that the birds were probably kept indoors, but if there
are any windows the photoperiod may have affected general light adaptation and
behaviour. It would in fact be interesting to compare the results of the experiments in
February with those in April–significantly different photoperiod if there are any windows
in the aviary and/or experimental room. There are so many changes from winter to
spring in birds that this may also affect their visual system indirectly through physiology
and endocrinology as well as direct effects on light adaptation in winter versus spring.
This is not a criticism of this paper, just a little worry if not a suggestion of some possible
future work.
Yes, the birds are kept inside at a fixed light/dark rhythm, (specified at line 108).
To the best of my knowledge, there is only little information of how animal vision
may change between seasons (e.g. reindeer tapetum, fish sensitivity), and
nothing described in birds. I’m not sure what the prediction would be, would
zebra finch vision change from winter to summer? This is clearly outside the
scope of these studies, but may indeed be an interesting subject for future work.
Figure 1 caption. You said that the arena rested on “grey” boards. Did you measure the
reflectance spectra of this “grey”? Almost everything made for human vision is strongly
absorbant in the UV, so in fact the boards may not have been gray to the birds. What
was the illumination? If little UV in the light, then a UV-absorbing “grey” would not
matter. Of course the monitor doesn’t produce UV, so maybe this doesn’t matter.
Yes, the monitor (no UV) was the only light source in the setup, so this doesn’t
matter. I have now made this clear in the figure caption.
Line 140-142. Why were the stimuli so big? 4cm diameter is very much larger than the
normal food eaten by finches or colour patches on their heads. In fact it is almost as big
as the birds. Why didn’t you use a smaller size, for example the same size as a zebra
finch’s cheek patch if you are interested in sexual selection? Some justification is needed
here.
Good point. Chromatic contrast sensitivity decreases when the objects of interest
“get small” (See Lind and Kelber, 2011, J Vis). This dependence has a low-
frequency-pass characteristics, so for “very large” (low spatial frequency) objects,
contrast sensitivity is invariantly high. Not to risk to present stimuli in the spatial
frequency region where contrast sensitivity changes with size, I chose to only use
large patches for which chromatic sensitivity is invariantly high. I have now
stated this explicitly at lines 143-145.
did you have it calibrated in micro moles m^-2 nm^-1 steradian^-1? The latter would be
best for proper calculations.
Measurements were taken with a narrow-angle radiance probe that ensured
measurement from only the stimulus, or only the background. I measured
radiance, so that light flux was specified per steradian (uW cm^-2 nm^-1 sr^-1). I
have now specified this at line 148.
Why did you aim it at 60 degrees? Is that the average gaze angle of the birds towards the
monitor RNL in the experimental chamber?
I chose 60 degrees that roughly correspond to viewing gaze of the birds just prior
to choice. I found no effect on the recorded spectrum from varying the angle of
the probe towards the monitor during the measurements (lines 150-152), the
specific angle of measurement is irrelevant.
Equation 2 and lines 171-176. It would be more in keeping with physics if you used Q
for quanta of radiance and irradiance rather than S for quantum flux, and even more
confusing (to people with physics background) to use Q for quantum catch rer. It is
also annoying that almost every new paper on RNL uses different symbols for the same
units (and that includes subsequent papers by Voroybev and Osorio!). I personally think
that one should use C and c for quanta captures to avoid confusion with quantal
irradiance and radiance. I also think it would be very helpful to specify the units of what
you call r, p, o, R, S and Q. Most papers are really sloppy about this.
Unfortunately, this terminology is more or less standard and difficult to avoid. I
stick to the most common notation, in which quantum catch is denoted by Q. I’m
afraid that changing this to C would be even more confusing to people used to
these equations. However, I change stimulus S for L (commonly used for
luminance) in order to avoid confusion between stimulus and chromatic distance
(eq. 7), and I added a specification of the parameter r (normalized absorbance
spectrum) and pi. The terms p and o are transmittance, thus unit-less, while the
unit of the stimulus is defined as quantum radiance and therefore (quanta cm^-2
nm^-1 sr^-1). Please see changes at lines 160-195.
Equation 7, you should probably cite the Osorio and Voroybev paper for this equation.
Done, see line 204.
Lines 214-219. Please say how long (mean +/- SD) it took to train the birds (days) and
do each trial (hours/minutes).
I’m not sure what information is requested here. Birds were trained in several
steps so there is no single time measure of the training. Moreover, there is no
clear onset of training as initial exploration of the arena was gradually
transformed into more strict conditional training for the stimuli. This is described
in detail on lines 219-231. A detail description of the trials already exists. Each
trial started with a 3 seconds display of stimuli, then birds chose and stimuli were
removed immediately (trial ended) for incorrect choices, while stimuli remained
for 5 seconds when correct choices were made. So, each trial was either about 3,
or about 5 seconds. Each sessions comprised between 10 and 50 trials and were
therefore highly variable in length. Please see lines 146, 227-237.
so even if the “gray” abosorbs UV it will not matter. It might be worth saying this where
my question came up.
Se answer above.
Figure 2 caption “The variation in UVS cone is negligible and not shown”. You may
want to modify this to say “The mean and variation in the UVS cone is negligable and
not shown”. It is important that the UVS cone is hardly stimulated at all.
Agree, this is now changed, please see figure caption.
“It is assumed that the receptors are adapted to the gray background”, but I cannot tell
if this is true because you did not give the acceptance angle of the radiance sensor. If it
was narrower than the birds field of view then it will give a false background spectrum
because it did not include the rest of the chamber that also affects the birds eyes during
the trial. Please clarify this.
The only light source in the arena was the monitor. This is now clarified in figure
caption 1. As black curtains flanked the rest of the arena, and grey boards blocked
parts of the monitor outside the arena (described at lines 129-133), birds were
adapted to the relatively bright floor background, upon which the stimuli were
presented, and not the dim surroundings. In order to better illustrate this, I have
no added movies of the setup and tests in the supplementary information.
I like the idea of the inset to avoid crowding but it would be still better if you could
simply give an enlargement of all the points near the neutral point.
A good point, thank you. I have followed this advice and added yet some other
changes to make the figure easier to read.
Lines 220-221. Please define what you mean by “properly”, or, define the criteria for
when the birds were “unmotivated” or failed to do the task “properly”. This is a bit
vague.
I have now described these conditions in some more detail at lines 227-230.
Lines 236-243. How did you control for order effects in the order of colours every bird
experienced? There are a lot of experiments showing that extensive experience with one
colour significantly affects choice of other colours in both positive and negative ways,
depending upon the perceptual differences between them. I am a little worried by the
apparent fact that you are using the same colour sequence for each bird, rather than
randomising the order as in hundreds of other animal (and human) behaviour
experiments.
The order of initial training was the same for all birds. This cannot be avoided, as
I need to confirm that birds pass initial training levels to be used in the later
training and tests. Please note, however, that all birds chose between the same
colours in all tests, only the background was varied.
More importantly, I was careful to use a randomized design for the subsequent
tests, and subsequent “instruction” training. This is described at lines (255-258).
Later tests could not be randomized together with earlier tests as they comprise
different task/behaviour concept. For the red background, the background turn
from being similar to the negative stimulus to be similar to the positive stimulus
and such a reversal could greatly confuse the birds, thus requiring specific
the task of discrimination and therefore positioned as a final tests.
Line 249-251. Please define what you mean by a Michelson contrast (give the formula
for calculating it)–this will not be familiar to the majority of readers of the journal.
Michelson contrast is now defined in eq. 8, at lines 254-259.
Please justify the use of 16 29 35% and also why 29% is repeated on line 251.
I am little bit confused by this comment. The percentage contrast was for the
difference between stimulus and background, though this is already described in
the manuscript:
The rewarded disc was brighter than the background with a Michelson contrast of 29%, 35%, 29%,
and 16% for the grey, yellow, green, and bright grey backgrounds respectively.
In order to study the effect of the chromaticity of the background, I kept the
achromatic contrast fairly constant over conditions, except for the bright grey
background that was specifically design to test the effect of altering background
achromatic contrast. As explain in the Results at lines 309-311, even the larger
difference in achromatic contrast between the background and the stimuli did not
influence the results. Moreover, during the first tests, all stimuli contrasted the
background to make it a discrimination task, while in later tests, I tested
detection. This is already discussed in detail on lines 383-393 and I prefer not add
this discussion at several places (to avoid a bulky manuscript).
Line 253, birds pairs assigned one of the background randomly. This partially gets at my
question of order effects, but does not answer the problem of the stimulus order effect
on lines 236-243.
Please see my comments on this above.
Line 268. Please justify the choice of 6.8 or 4.8 JNDs. A lot of the experimental design
seems highly arbitrary with no justification.
I hope that my changes and explanation makes it clear that experimental design
was carefully planned and followed a clear logic. The choice of initial training of
the birds to the two contrasts 6.8 and 4.8 was arbitrary, however, this is inevitable.
As we cannot know the performance of the birds before testing, we can only make
a qualified guess about the visual capacity, their thresholds of discrimination and
detection and from that outline some initial training conditions. Still, this is a
characteristics of the vast majority of psychophysics work on animal senses and I
don’t think this is a problem as we can expect that a honing of the initial training
has small or no effect on later tests with stimuli around threshold.
Line 279. Why did you set the threshold to 66.7%? Another instance of what seems a
totally aribtrary choice of experimental design. These numbers need justification. I like
the use of fitting a psychometric function to the data but I do not understand why you
used 66.7%
I am not sure what is meant here? The threshold is already justified by binomial
statistics at lines (line 289-290), which is standard to this kind of work. Of course,
this means that a bias in choice frequency over 66.7% is significant, thus
influenced by something other than simple randomness, but this hardly needs
explanation?
Figure 3. I am amazed by the individual variation among birds in discrimination
thresholds! As I mentioned before, how does this relate to the date of the test? But what
is really worrying is that 3 birds had a lower threshold for a lower contrast (negative slope
on your graph). On the other hand the points do not have confidence limits or SD so in
fact it may well be that changes in discrimination thresholds of less than 0.5 JND are
meaningless. But, if that were true then maybe only one bird showed a significant
relationship between background contrast and discrimination threshold. This is a general
limitation to estimation of JNDs rather than any fault in the experimental design. But
this problem does need to be discussed. In other words, just how seriously are we to
take the changes in thresholds?
I disagree, I think that the threshold changes rather little between the two
conditions in figure 3, possibly with the exception of one bird. Also, there are 2
not 3 birds with a negative slope in the graph. On the whole, there is no effect of
the achromatic contrast of the background, which is shown by the statistical tests
reported in figure caption. In any case, any variation in this data does not
influence the other data that were collected for a stable achromatic contrast
between background and stimulus.
Figure 3 caption. Why in the world did you specify background luminance in candelas
per m^2?! Utterly irrelevant to vision except for humans. It must be specified as quanta
and definitely not something dependent upon human vision.
In fact, the candela measure is a meaningful indicator for the brightness of the
experimental conditions as for birds, the visual sensitivity of the achromatic
channel (double cones) is very similar to the achromatic visual sensitivity of the
human eye. In any case, I revised the manuscript so that I now include both
quantum catch of double cones, and candelas (see figure captions).
Line 317. Just what do you mean by “dimmer”? Less radiant? Less reflective? And also
just what do you mean by “cromaticity”? Distance from the neutral point in the
tetrahedron or some other measure?
I have now change “dimmer” to less radiant, and I have defined clarified what I
mean with chromaticity the first time it appears, at lines 272-273. (Same
chromaticity means the same position/locus in the chromaticity diagram)
Figure 4. Once again I am rather worried by the amazing variation among birds. Again,
does the variation for a particular background contrast vary with Julian date? On the
other hand the worst variation is for the yellow background which may be the most
unrealistic natural background. In their natural habitat Zebra finches live on areas with
lots of reddish soil and other places with light gray soil. Yellow would not be
experience, and green is rare except in the few wetter parts of their distribution.
Moreover, all the natural backgrounds are UV rich, so all colours may appear odd to the
birds. Still, it is interesting that the best results are for the red background, a natural (if
much more chromatic) background. On the other hand the long training with reds in
the training schedule may have predisposed them to work better with reds.
Unfortunately, since you didn’t train them on, say, green on gray, we have no way to
discriminate between these two hypotheses. Also worth discussion.
I would not agree that the results are highly variable other than for two of the
birds that performed poorly on the yellow background. This is discussed in
length at lines 368-376. Moreover, I find the consideration of background colours
manuscript without risking a very speculative and large discussion.
Figure 4, caption. Again the nonsensical use of human-vision-based cd/m^2.
This is now changed.
Figure 5. It is very interesting that some birds showed what appears to be a threshold
and others showed a gradual change with JNDs. The location of the “threshold” for
panels C D, E and G is nonsense; there are no signs of thresholds there. Instead refer to
the red bars as the 50% value or some other less-misleading term.
These are the psychometric thresholds defined at 66.7%, in line with
psychophysic theory. They are not indicative of any step-like behaviour of the
psychometric data/function but show the stimulus intensity level for positive
stimulus detection at a certain correct choice frequency. I have now added more
information in the figure caption and a reference to the method section to make
this clear.
Line 367, “a noise level of 0.1 in the LWS cone”. The literature is very confused about
noise levels and weber fractions. Just what does 0.1 refer to here? Does it refer to the
Weber fraction (omega, another laughable symbol since it is the Greek letter equivalent
to the latin O, but looks like a latin W)? Or does it refer to the numerator of the Weber
fraction (nu), or does it refer to something else. Please be more careful with
terminology. And what did you use for the “noise levels” (omegas?) for the other cones?
I’m sorry if this is unclear. I’ve followed classic terminology in vision science
where cone mechanisms represent the receptor channel (with all receptor types of
the same kind integrated), thus the noise here is really the Weber fraction of the
LWS channel. I have now changed “noise” to Weber fraction and added a
reference to equation 6, please see lines 377-378.
Line 386. If I remember correctly it also applies to sound and possibly olfaction. (Not
necessary to say this here, unless you want to).
Thank you for this information.
Lines 386-388. This might simply be a result of chromatic adaptation to the background,
not requiring any fancy retinal or brain integration. There is a huge literature on this
subsumed under the term “colour constancy”. You almost allude to this below on lines
418-422. You could get at this by varying the vonKries correction using the background
radiance. Again my comment about the acceptance angle of your radiance sensor.
About the sensor, please see my earlier comments.
I fail to see how a variable von Kries correction can explain the dipper function
and I haven’t seen this in the literature. I know som parts of the vast literature on
colour constancy in humans, and I avoid to bring this up simply because colour
constancy and its relationships to receptor adaptation and colour discrimination
capacity is complex, still disputed, and outside the scope of this study.
Lines 413-414. Your comments about large objects prompts me to bring up the
excessively large size of your stimuli. I wonder what would have happened if you had
used more naturalistic stimuli sizes, either that of facial colour patches (communication)
or seeds.
Yes, interesting questions. I hope to answer these questions soon as more
experiments are already planned with the finches!
Lines 427-428. Actually the data show that only some colours are placed in categories; as
I mentioned before, there is no evidence for categories for panels C D E and G in figure
5.
This is a misunderstanding. Figure 5 shows psychometric function, correct
choice frequencies over stimulus intensities, but not over stimulus categories. In
the discussion, I mention colour categories and colour learning merely as
possible explanations of the data, and suggest that the study design can be an
interesting tool for further analysis of this.
Figure 6 is excellent in showing the minimum at about 1JND. However that argument is
rather arbitrary and tautological since you chose a weber fraction of 0.1 based on
discrimination. Still, it is in line with other studies using 0.1.
I agree, this study was not design to test absolute discrimination thresholds, and
from that infer noise levels. Still, the results are in close agreement with other
studies.
There is a more serious problem in that the regression lines may be an artifact of the two
points at 18, with no points in between these and the others. Also there are two points
left out. The real worry with these two thresholds with no background contrast is that it
suggests that all points at about 3 JNDs and below are perceived the same and as noise
(type I statistical error, or false positives in the signal detection literature).
I disagree. A core finding of these studies is that the detection/discrimination
threshold is a function of background contrast and that there is a dip of this
function at modest background contrast. All stimuli above these thresholds are
available for perception, ie. everything above 3 JND for no background contrast,
but all stimulus contrast above 1JND for modest background contrast.
Consequently it looks like you have a cloud of points at the noise level below
background contrast of about 7 and only two points at 18, which is a very poor way to
get a relationship. This would be taken more seriously had you had many points
between 8 and 18. Consequently the rank speculation on lines 471-477 is unjustified, or
needs to be made with a lot more caution.
I have now added statistics to show that the correlations between thresholds and
background contrast are significant in both birds. Please see the figure caption.
know to look at discrimination of colours presenting large contrasts with the
background. As far as I can tell the work although somewhat preliminary has been done
well and the basic findings are sound and important. At present the article is not suitable
for publication for various reasons.
1. The prose is full of minor errors, several of which I have corrected on the attached
PDF.
I have now adjusted the manuscript in accordance with the PDF-comments.
2. The figures are quite difficult to read.
I have now changed figure 2 and improved figure captions to make the figures
easier to read.
3. The findings should be more carefully related to the predictions of Fechners law, with
some discussion of human performance if not in colour then in other sensory tasks.By
comparison a good deal is made of the Dipper function. This would be fine of the effect
were convincing, but as presented the evidence needs to be explained better (e.g. on
Figure 4) and supported by statistical evidence. Overall careful revision and focus would
greatly benefit this work.
Fechner’s law describes the invariance of the perception of stimulus strength, but
this is not relevant here. Fechner’s law is closely associated with Webers law that
describes the log-invariance of detection thresholds over stimulus intensity. This
is relevant for conditions where it can be assumed that the sensory system is
adapted to stimulus intensity, and the task is to detect deviations from that
intensity. Some sensory task and test condition are in line with this, e.g.
incremental spectral sensitivity for different backgrounds, and for these we expect
that Weber’s law hold over a large range of intensities. Here, I test discrimination
of stimuli that differ from the background and we cannot expect Weber fractions
to be invariant, thus a failure of Weber’s law. In a sense, this is a test of what
happens when Weber’s law is violated at different degrees. I have now
commented this in the introduction, at lines 83-87.
The dipper function is well described in the literature on human vision, and this
work has been cited in the manuscript. I am not sure how the existence of the
dipper function could be validated by statistics. Perhaps, on a large sample size,
it would be possible to show that a non-linear function makes a better fit than a
linear function, but this is not meaningful with complete data from only two
individuals. I have now changed the figure caption for figure 6 to more explicitly
point out the obvious dip in the threshold function.
