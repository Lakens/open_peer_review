This work is very important because it proposes for the first time a datamatrix of characters for
“basal” Neopterygii which merges numerous data from different previously published
datamatrices built to address phylogenetic relationships of inclusive clades, i.e. the
ginglymodians, the halecomorphs and the basal teleosts. It also includes thorough discussions of
several characters (in the main text and in the ESM2) with re-definitions of characters and
character states, and proposes completely new characters. It represents a huge amount of work
and it will certainly represent a new basis for all future studies dealing with the phylogeny of
extinct neopterygians, which represent about half of the vertebrate biodiversity.
I made some comments directly in the pdf file and I add some more below (Appendix A):
Page 2, l. 49: “more characters will hopefully be added in the future”. Another way to build a
more accurate phylogeny, rather than to add more characters, would be to improve the
definitions of characters and of the character states. In particular it seems clear to me that several
characters in this study, as well as in most studies including numerous characters, contain a lot of
linked characters, char. 14 and 15 as just an example (two or more characters are related because
they depend of the same developmental process). One possibility would be to decrease the
number of characters used, but to add more derived states (even if it is in contradiction with
some recommendations, such as from Brazeau, 2011). This is what the authors did for some
characters, such as 23 or 39 for instance. I don’t suggest to the authors to try this approach here
(this is a new project per se!), but I stress the fact that adding more and more characters will
probably not help to better resolve phylogenies; it will just add more unjustifiable weight on
some anatomical features by cutting them into multiple small pieces. For instance, char. 193 can
be regarded as another state of char. 192.
Page 4, l. 13-14: “Only the unambiguous synapomorphies were taken into account, discriminating
between unique and non-unique synapomorphies.” Maybe I don’t understand this. It seems to
me that unambiguous characters simply correspond to characters, which are not dependent of
unknown codings. They are not informative about unique synapomorphies (which are characters
with a ci=1), no?
Page 16, l. 6: The position of Varasichthys within the leptolepids is not discussed here. Can the
authors discuss this point, in particular in the light of the pattern obtained by Arratia (2008), who
found connection of this genus with the “crossognathiforms” (including Notelops, located far
away in this new phylogeny)
Chapter 5. The authors mention here the fact that the phylogenetic position of Thrissops and
Caturus differ from previous studies. They discussed below the case of Caturus, but not of
Thrissops. Can they provide some data why the position of Thrissops is unusual? Actually,
Thrissops is the single representative of the large group of ichthyodectiforms, whose
phylogenetic relationships with outher neopterygians have not been addressed for a long time.
The position found here is actually not so different from the one proposed by Patterson & Rosen
(1977), i.e. a basal teleost close to L. coryphaenoides and to Tharsis (which are grouped here in a
clade).
Chapter 5.2: Why the authors did not discuss with more details the topologies obtained with the
down-weighting analyses, in particular the different position obtained for Dapedium?
3
Conclusion: Contrary to the rest of the text, this section seems to have been written quickly and
without much care. It introduces several important new ideas (with 3 new figures!), but the
message is not enough developed and there are too much imprecisions. Also, the first part of the
conclusion deals with the evolutionary history of the neopterygians, and the second part
suggested that this history is completely biased by the fossil record. It would have been better to
start by explaining the biases, then to discuss the main trends that can be nevertheless proposed.
This conclusion should either be included in the main text and extended, or it should be more
developed and make the subject of another short paper. Anyway, this point does not preclude to
the general high quality of this paper and I strongly support its publication pending the
modifications suggested.
I went through the ESM2, which contains most of the new data and results of this article. Most of
the characters are either new or discussed from former studies, and they correspond to a broad
range of fish groups tackled in several previous studies. Interestingly, for several numerical
characters the states are defined on the basis of the analysis of the range observed in the set of
compared taxa by searching for gaps that allow defining limits between states. This is a very
reasonable approach. It is not the place in this review to discuss the merit of each character: as
said before, most are better defined than in previous studies and if debates may exist on some of
them, these will be addressed in future studies. As mentioned by the authors in the conclusion,
“This has been an enormous effort and is certainly not free of failure, so we hope future scholars
will contribute with a critical approach…”
I only suggest minor changes in ESM2 (most misspellings) and I have no comments for ESM1, 3
and 4. (Appendix B)

Lopez-Arbarello and Sferco present a new phylogenetic analysis investigating the relationships
between the largest living group of fishes (teleosts) and their once-diverse but now scarce
relatives (gar and bowfin). In their investigation, they appear to have assumed nothing as a
given, providing tons of detail and very specific justifications for their character set. They have
cafrefully and thoroughly reconsidered all the characters previously used to establish the
neopterygian tree, reformulating many of their old characters, and adding a large set of new
useful ones. They have also examined all relevant fossil material, reevaluating previous coding.
This tremendous effort shows – they have established new synapomorphies for major clades
while eliminating the evidence for others. This paper is very well-written and full of critical
evaluation of the evidence, detailed comparative morphology, and well-argued points. It will be a
useful resource for ichthyologists, and a basis for further analyses, for a long time to come.
I recommend publication once they address minor concerns on the utility and descriptions of
some characters. These involve the use of shapes and counts which are likely to be homoplastic in
origin, their interpretation of the record and timing of diversification, and group selection. These
are listed below:
General: Why are pycnodonts excluded?
4.1 Relative position of the dorsal fin (character 1). What influence did this biomechanically-
relevant trait have on the topology of the tree? I would expect that it would be highly
homoplastic given the functional implications, and would recommend reformulation around a
more phylogenetically relevant aspect of this trait if not removal. Even though it’s been used in
previous studies, it is confounding factor in reconstructing phylogeny considering demonstrated
convergence in ecomorphological studies of living and fossil fishes.
5.3 “crown-neopterygians”
Page 14, line 51: What does “increasiningly large and stout basal fulcra” mean more specifically,
and how is this synapomorphy for Neoginglymodi distinguished from other enlarged fulcra
(since it’s not homoplastic in your tree)? Is there a better way to describe this?
Fig. 11 – What would happen if you timescaled this tree quantitatively, instead of assuming short
branches subtending the first occurrences, and long ghost lineages? How would that affect your
interpretations of the timing of diversification?
Character 3: Ornamentation. Character states 0 and 1 seem to be overly broad. Is there any
specific pattern for ornamentation loss? If not, It might be better as a two-state double-
“autopamorphy” for obaichthyid gars and Pliodetes (presence/absence of odontodes). Are there
patterns beyond ridges and tubercles which might contain phylogenetic signal?
Characters 5 and 6 – posterior margins of scales. Might these be generalized to decrease
inapplicability?
Character 10 – Squamation of the ventrum – there are probably other states here, since the ventral
scale patterns of most fishes have not been examined in detail. It’s not clear from Fig. S2 how the
ventral scales in these fishes are different from similar “shallowing” seen in a lot of other early
actinopterygians.
Characters 11-12: Not only semionotids have dorsal ridge scales… This might be a
symplesiomorphy not picked up by an analysis excluding “palaeoniscoids”
5
93. Dermopterotic length. There might be an obvious break between over 50% and less than 50%,
and over 30 and under 30, but the rest seem arbitrary and continuous.
131. number of anterior infraorbitals: The “or mores” should be removed except for state 6
145. Distribution of suborbitals: Not clear what “outspread anteriorly” means.
184-187. Is the shape of the teeth phylogenetically informative?
199. Ornamentation of opercle – does this cover all group-specific variation?
207. Brachiostegal counts – why is a different range used? Is there a plot as for the other discrete
states assigned to continuous values?
301 – number of dorsal fin rays – this is a function of fin shape? The distribution show suggests it
isn’t particularly informative.
302 – what is the distribution of this fin shape character?

Lopez-Arbarello and Sferco present a new phylogenetic analysis investigating the relationships
between the largest living group of fishes (teleosts) and their once-diverse but now scarce

22
23
The phylogenetic relationships of the recently described genus †Ticinolepis from the Middle Triassic of Monte
24
25 San Giorgio are explored through cladistic analyses of the so far largest morphological data set for
26 actinopterygians, including representatives of the crown neopterygian clades Halecomorphi, Ginglymodi, and
27
28 Teleostei, and merging the lists of characters from previously published systematic studies together with newly
29 proposed characters. †Ticinolepis is retrieved as the most basal Ginglymodi and our results support the
30 monophyly of Teleostei and Holostei, as well as Halecomorphi and Ginglymodi within the latter clade. The
31
32 patterns of relationships within these clades mostly agree with previous studies, though a few important
33 differences require future research. According to our results, the ionoscopiforms are not monophyletic,
34
caturids are not amiiforms and leptolepids and luisiellids form a monophyletic clade. Our phylogenetic
35
36 hypothesis confirms the rapid radiation of the holostean clades Halecomorphi and Ginglymodi during the Early
37 and Middle Triassic and the radiation of pholidophoriform teleosts during the Late Triassic. Crown-group
38
Halecomorphi have an enormous ghost lineage throughout most of the Mesozoic, but ginglymodians and
39
40 teleosts show a second radiation during the Early Jurassic. The crown-groups of Halecomorphi, Ginglymodi
41 and Teleostei originated within parallel events of radiation during the Late Jurassic.

44 2. Introduction
45
The Neopterygii is the largest group of living vertebrates, including c. 32,650 valid species (1), the vast
46 majority of which are teleosts. The origin of this important clade goes back to the Palaeozoic (2, 3), but its most
47 important radiation occurred in the early Mesozoic (3). Ginglymodi, Halecomorphi and Teleostei are the three
48 major clades currently recognized among crown neopterygians (Actinopterygii: Neopterygii). Whereas for
49 much of the second half of the last century halecomorphs and teleosts were regarded as sister groups, to the
50 exclusion of ginglymodians, recent morphological (e.g. (4, 5)), molecular studies (6-11) and combined studies
51 (11) support the monophyly of the Holostei: a major clade including both Ginglymodi and Halecomorphi,
52 which is in turn the sister group of Teleostei. Although there is clearly a strong molecular signal supporting
53 the Holostei clade, there is still uncertainty in the morphological data (see review by (2)) and the Holostei
54 hypothesis is yet being questioned by challenging new studies (e.g. (12)). The main problem of molecular

phylogenies is the lack of important information due to the exclusion of fossils, apart from the historical
information on the stem lineage of the clade under study. The missing information is especially important
1 when completely extinct lineages are excluded, which might represent a significant expansion of the currently
2 expressed morphospace of a lineage. Only the combination of both molecular and morphological data leads to
3 optimal phylogenetic results: a Total Evidence approach (13-15).
4 Including fossil taxa in Total Evidence analyses is not only necessary to achieve a solid pattern of
5 neopterygian phylogenetic relationships, but also to fully understand the macroevolutionary processes that
6 led to the near extinction of the holosteans along with the peerless radiation of teleosts (see Hunt and Slater
7 (16) for a review of the advantages of including fossils in phylogenetic analyses). The main obstacle for the
8 Total Evidence method is the usual large amount of missing data (17-19). It is known that the amount of
9 morphological data for fossil taxa depends on the quality of preservation (in particular, soft tissues are only
10 exceptionally preserved), which, together with the lack of molecular information, lead to a very large
11 proportion of missing data in Total Evidence matrices. However, the effects of missing data in these analyses
12 have been investigated by Guillerme and Cooper (20, 21), who demonstrated that the amount of missing data
13 in fossil taxa is not problematic when there are enough morphological characters and enough morphological
14 information of living taxa in the data matrix. Fortunately, this is the case in holosteans (see below).
Dramatically, in contrast to the c. 32,640 species of living teleosts, non-teleost neopterygians are currently
15
represented by only seven species of gars (Ginglymodi: Lepisosteiformes) and the bowfin, Amia calva
16
(Halecomorphi: Amiiformes). This tremendous asymmetry in the number of Recent representatives of the
17
crown neopterygian lineages does by far not reflect the situation during the early Mesozoic. During the
18 Triassic-Jurassic, the diversity of ginglymodians and halecomorphs probably equated or even exceeded that of
19 teleosts (22), and there is a large amount of fossil taxa that have never been included in cladistic analyses.
20 Numerous studies have been dedicated to the morphology of living gars, Amia and their direct fossil relatives
21 (see (5, 23), and literature cited therein) and, although the morphology of many fossil holosteans is still poorly
22 known, numerous fossil holostean and teleost taxa, several of them representing extinct lineages, have been
23 studied in detail and included in cladistic analyses during the last decades (e.g. (24-40)). These studies
24 represent important steps towards a Total Evidence analysis of the Neopterygii, in which missing information
25 should not be problematic because the fossil taxa will be properly anchored in the tree thanks to the available
26 molecular and morphological information on the living representatives (20, 21). However, more taxa and
27 characters are needed and a lot of work remains to be done in this direction.
28 Triassic neopterygians are particularly interesting for several reasons. Most recent molecular phylogenies
29 predict divergence dates during the Devonian (394–290 Ma) for the Neopterygii, and during the
30 Carboniferous-Permian for the Holostei (312–245 Ma) and Teleostei (333–250 Ma) (data from Sallan (2): tab. 1).
31 On the other hand, the earliest certain representative of the lineage leading to crown-Neopterygii is known
32 from the Permian, while the earliest members of the holostean and teleost total groups are Triassic (3). Even if
33 future palaeontological discoveries might fill the gap between the estimated divergence dates and the age of
the currently known fossils, the fossil record shows that the first important radiation of the Neopterygii
34
occurred during the Triassic (3). Triassic neopterygians further present conflicting combinations of
35
morphological features that have been proposed as synapomorphies for one or the other of the three crown-
36 neopterygian clades (e.g. (37, 41, 42)). Including Triassic taxa in phylogenetic studies of Neopterygii is thus
37 necessary, even if they might increase the level of homoplasy (43).
38 Within this context, the present contribution is dedicated to explore the phylogenetic relationships of the
39 recently described Middle Triassic neopterygian genus †Ticinolepis López-Arbarello, Bürgin, Furrer and
40 Stockar, 2016 (37). This is one of the taxa showing a mixture of morphological features typically ascribed to
41 Gynglimodi or Halecomorphi, together with other features observed only in teleosts (37). For this reason, to
42 study the relationships of †Ticinolepis, we conducted a cladistic analyses based on the so far largest
43 morphological data set for actinopterygians, including representatives of the three crown neopterygian clades
44 and merging the lists of characters from previously published systematic studies of neopterygians together
45 with newly proposed characters. Our list of characters is not just the simple assemblage of characters taken
46 from previous work. We have carefully revised previous lists of characters and the hypotheses of primary
47 homology behind them. We have merged and modified the definition of most characters to avoid problematic
48 coding as discussed by Jenner (44) and Brazeau (45). Our list of 339 morphological characters is not yet
49 complete, more characters will hopefully be added in the future, but it is certainly a solid base to start working
50 on the endless task of completing information seeking for the neopterygian evolutionary tree.

52 3. Materials and Methods
53
54 3.1. Taxonomic sampling and nomenclature
55 The investigation of the phylogenetic relationships of †Ticinolepis was performed through a parsimony analysis of a
56 matrix of 339 morphological characters scored for 99 species (93 extinct and 6 living taxa). All operational taxonomic
57 units are species (Supplementary File S1).

3 According to previous phylogenetic hypotheses for crown neopterygians (summarized by Friedman (3)) and
considering the availability of published morphological information, the Early Triassic stem neopterygians
4
†Australosomus kochi Stensiö, 1932 (46), †Boreosomus piveteaui Nielsen, 1942 (47), †Pteronisculus stensioi (Nielsen,
5
1942) (47), and †Plesiofuro mingshuica Su, 1993 (48), were chosen as outgroup taxa. The ingroup includes 36
6 gynglimodians (36%; two living species), 25 halecomorphs (25%; one living species), 29 teleosts (29%; three living
7 species), and 5 taxa of uncertain relationships (the two species of †Ticinolepis and three species of †Dapedium).
8 Taxonomic names are used, proposed and/or defined according to the rules and recommendations of the
9 International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN 2000) and in agreement with the PhyloCode (49).
10 Accordingly, the following clades are here recognized: total clade Neopterygii sensu Regan (50), crown-group
11 Neopterygii sensu Patterson (51), Holostei sensu Grande (5), Ginglymodi sensu López-Arbarello (26),
12 Halecomorphi sensu Patterson (52), and total clade Teleostei sensu De Pinna (53).
13

15
3.2. Character coding and scoring
López-Arbarello et al. (37) described the genus †Ticinolepis from the Ladinian (Middle Triassic) of the Monte
16
San Giorgio and discussed the resemblance of this fish with ginglymodians, but also with halecomorphs and
17
teleosts. Due to this mixture of morphological features, none of the available data matrices would have been
18 adequate to explore the phylogenetic relationships of this genus because each of them was designed for
19 cladistic analyses of the relationships within one or the other of the three main crown-neopterygian groups
20 and solving the systematic position of †Ticinolepis required the inclusion of all of them. Compiling such a
21 comprehensive data matrix needed the revision of all hypotheses of homology and the consequent
22 redefinition of many characters and character states. The resulting data matrix includes a total of 339
23 morphological characters (see complete list of characters in Supplementary File S2). Among them, 76 are
24 newly defined and the remaining characters are the result of merging and modifying characters from most
25 previous cladistic analyses of crown neopterygians (see complete list below). Emended definitions of
26 characters are based on a thorough revision of primary homology hypotheses taking special care to avoid
27 those definitions that imply the use of unspecified absence states (44) as well as repeated absences, pseudo-
28 ordering, and compound characters (45).
29 Whenever possible character scoring was based on direct examination of specimens or on descriptions in
30 the literature if the material was not available to us (see list of examined material and literature in
31 Supplementary File S1). The data matrix was prepared with Mesquite version 3.2 (54). There are 127 multistate
32 characters with an average of 3 and a maximum of 9 character states (ch. 124: Largest infraorbital bone). The
33 matrix contains average proportions of 37% and 35% missing data and 7% and 10% innaplicable scorings for
the taxa and characters, respectively. The maximal amount of missing data is 75% for the ginglymodian
34
†Cammerichthys lunae, which is only known from a partially complete skull, and 92% for character 211
35
‘Infrafaringobranchial tooth plates’, which is a feature rarely observed in fossils. The maximal amount of
36 innaplicalbe scorings is 27% for †Australosomus kochi among the outgroup taxa and 15% for †Pachycormus
37 macropterus within the ingroup, and 92% for character 193 ‘anterior notch of preopercle’, which is a feature
38 unique of a few pholidophoriform teleosts. Despite the high amount of missing data in certain characters
39 (notably higher for endocranial features), all characters are parsimony informative.
40 Autapomorphic character states are not unusual in our data matrix. These states are not informative for the
41 tree search, but are informative concerning the amount of homoplasy. The only valid alternative instead of
42 scoring an autapomorphic character state would be to score the feature ‘inapplicable’ for the taxon in question.
43 Such alternative scoring artificially increases the index of homoplasy (and lowers the consistency index)
44 because it will be treated as missing data by the algorithm. Additionally, autapomorphic character states
45 would also be informative for other possible studies (e.g. disparity analyses), which might be based on these
46 data in the future.
47
48 3.3. Cladistic methodology
49
The cladistic analyses were performed with TNT (55) under equal and implied weighting (56). In contrast to
50
the commonly used equal weighting analyses, where all characters are given the same weight, implied
51 weighting analyses were designed to down-weight characters according to its level of homoplasy in order to
52 obtain a hypothesis that maximizes the influence of the more reliable characters at the expense of the more
53 homoplastic ones. In these procedures the fit of each character is calculated with a concave function of its
54 number of extra steps (i.e. the more homoplastic, the less fit) and the preferred tree(s) is(are) that(those) which
55 maximizes the total fit. The weighting strength (i.e. how strongly homoplastic characters are down-weighted)
56 is determined by using different concavity constant (K-values). We have used several concavity constants to
57 explore variations in the resulting pattern of relationships.

Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 4 of 41
In both equal weighted and implied weighting analyses, tree search was performed with the traditional
search option of TNT v. 1.1 (55, 57) applying random addition sequence (RAS) and tree bisection reconnection
1 (TBR) through 1000 replicates keeping 10 trees per replicate. TBR was applied to all the trees retained in
2 memory and trees are rooted in †Pteronisculus stensioi. Most characters are unordered and equally weighted;
3 three characters are ordered (chs. 32, 289, 325). Branch support was evaluated also with TNT applying
4 bootstrap expressed as values of GC (groups present/contradicted) through 10000 replicates and calculating
5 Bremer decay indexes for each node. Support measurements were calculated for implied (K=8 and K=3) and
6 equal weighting analyses.
7 Considering that within Teleostei both Teleocephala (sensu De Pinna (53)) and Clupeocephala are well-
8 corroborated groupings, demonstrated in several occasions by molecular and morphological phylogenetic
9 analyses (4, 10, 11) we performed the analyses with constraints enforcing the monophyly of this two main
10 clades of living teleosts. The phylogenetic data is freely available in the Supplementary files and in
11 MorphoBank (www.morphobank.org) under Project 2196.
12 The distribution of characters was analysed using the 'trace character history' option in Mesquite version 3.2
13 (54). Only the unambiguous synapomorphies were taken into account, discriminating between unique and
14 non-unique synapomorphies.
15
16 4. Discussion of characters
17 All 339 characters are listed in the Supplementary File S2. Unless the definition of a character is self-
18 explanatory or has been explained in some previous work, the characters are accompanied with additional
19 explanatory paragraph and/or figure. Additionally, some characters need thorough discussions, which are
20 included in this section.
21
22
23 4.1. Relative position of the dorsal fin
24 The relative position of the dorsal fin has been included in one or more characters and expressed in different
25 ways by many authors. In many cases, attempts have been made to represent the position of the dorsal fin
26 relative to the body in general (e.g. anterior, in the middle, posterior, etc.), which has important biomechanical
implications. However, such characters are usually very vaguely defined and they should rather be expressed
27
quantitatively, though this is also problematic. Alternatively, using the pelvic and anal fins as landmarks is a
28
useful tool to represent the relative position of the dorsal fin in the body of actinopterygians, even in those
29
fishes with extremely elongated bodies (e.g. †Saurichthys, †Aspidorhynchus, Belonidae). Therefore, we adopted
30 the multistate character proposed by López-Arbarello ((26): ch. 1), which was modified to encompass the
31 variation included in our data set.
32 Regarding the use of alternative coding to reflect the position of the dorsal fin, a character used by several
33 cladistic analyses “Dorsal and anal fins posteriorly placed” (e.g., (58): ch. 77, (59): ch. 99, (60): ch. 95, (61): ch.
34 94, (62): ch. 91), is an example of a vaguely defined character, and another character “Dorsal fin origin anterior
35 to that of pelvic fin” (e.g. (58): ch. 78, (61): ch. 100, (62): ch. 96, (61): ch. 95, (64): ch. 92) would imply
36 unspecified states (44) for our data set, both in the presence, embracing the conditions described in our
37 character states 2 and 3 (dorsal fin extending anterior to opposite of insertion of pelvic fins, or originating
38 anterior to insertion of pelvic and extending opposite to anal fins, respectively), and the absence, embracing
39 the conditions described in our character states 0–1 (dorsal fin originating posterior to insertion of pelvic and
40 extending backwards not beyond middle of anal fin, or originating approximately at the level of the origin of
41 the anal fin and extending opposite to it, respectively) and 4–5 (dorsal fin originating posterior to the origin of
42 anal fin, or originating posterior to insertion of pelvic and extending backwards up to end of anal fin).
43 Another binary character used in Arratia ((29): ch. 118), “Dorsal fin placed posteriorly, closer to caudal fins
44 than to pelvic fins”, or the reworded version of this character in Arratia ((39): ch. 136) embraces the conditions
described in our states 1 and 4 in one character state and the conditions in our states 0, 2, 3, and 5 in the other
45
character state. Cavin ((63): ch. 41) “Both dorsal and anal fins well developed, ending posteriorly close to the
46
caudal peduncle” is a compound character (45) involving unspecified absence of the two types discussed by
47
Jenner (44).
48
49
50 4.2. Type of scales
51 Ideally one would like to distinguish the palaeoniscoid and lepisosteoid types of the ganoid scales because
52 both lepisosteoid and elasmoid scales are homologous to palaeoniscoid scales, but it is possible that these two
53 types evolved independently (64, 65). However, the transition from one type to the other is gradual and might
54 occur within a single scale (66). Even when histological information is available for some taxa, one would need
55 to trace the presence/absence of dentine in scales from different regions of the body of each fish specimen,
56 which would probably result in heterogeneous patterns. Therefore, pending a more rigorous and detailed

2
3 analysis of the distribution of the different types of scales in Mesozoic actinopterygians, we apply here the
4 simply morphological distinction between ganoid, amioid and cycloid scales (ch. 4).
5 Other authors use independent a/p characters for each lepisosteoid, amioid and cycloid scale types (e.g.
(62): chs. 140–142), which is methodologically incorrect because these characters are not mutually independent
6
and involve unspecified absence states (44). Alternatively, the lepisosteoid, amioid and cycloid scale types
7
represent different states of a single multistate characters in several recent phylogenetic analyses (e.g. (29): ch.
8
156, (35): ch. 175), which is a valid option, but the scoring of lepisosteoid type of scales for a certain taxon is
9 questionable due to the lack of histological information (e.g. several Triassic teleosts in (29, 39)).
10 Among the ganoid scales, we distinguish different morphotypes (Fig. 1) according to the shape of the
11 posterior margin of the scales (ch. 6) and the presence or absent of different articulatory processes (chs 7–9).
12 Most ganoid scales of actinopterygians are articulated through the so-called peg-and-socket articulation
13 consisting of a dorsal spine-like peg protruding from the dorsal border of the scale, which fits in a conical
14 socket excavated in the medial surface of the scale (Fig. 1A–D, F). In some ginglymodians the scales have only
15 very reduced pegs and sockets, or this articulating structure is completely absent (Fig. 1E, G–H). The
16 reduction to complete absence of a peg-and-socket articulation occurs independently in the scales of several
17 lepisosteiform taxa (†Lepidotes, †Scheenstia, †Dentilepisosteus, †Masillosteus janeae, Atractosteus spatula). In
18 addition to the peg-and-socket articulation explained above, the scales of many ginglymodians (e.g. the
19 species of †Lepidotes and †Scheenstia, the callipurbeckiids) also form a rostro-caudal or longitudinal articulation
20 consisting of two anteriorly oriented processes protruding from the anteroventral and anterodorsal corners of
21 the scale (Fig. 1E–F). These processes can be as strong or stronger than the peg for the dorso-ventral
22 articulation, but they do not fit into pockets. In several taxa (e.g. †Semionotus, †Paralepidotus, †Pliodetes, and the
23 gars) the ventral anterior process is poorly developed and there is a strong dorsal anterior process (Fig. 1D, G–
H). The scales of several other taxa (†Australosomus, †Archaeosemionotus, †Boreosomus, †Obaichthys, †Ophiopsis,
24
†Panxianichths, †Plesiofuro) only have a small anterodorsal process (Fig. 1C). It is important to note that many
25
authors (e.g. (67): ch. 36, (68): ch. 59, (69): ch. 38), score the absence of peg-and-socket articulation for taxa with
26
amioid or cycloid scales. However, the peg-and-socket articulation is a feature of the ganoid scales and the
27 character is not applicable (–) for taxa with other scale types.
28
29
30 4.3. Endocranial fossae
31 Two main fossae have been identified in the otico-occipital region of the neopterygian endocranium: the
32 posttemporal fossa and the fossa bridgei. However, according to Bjerring (70) the terms ‘posttemporal fossa’
33 and ‘fossa bridgei’ have been misunderstood and erroneously applied to different fossae in the braincase of
34 the actinopterygians. After thorough discussions Bjerring (70) proposes a basic schema including five pairs of
35 endocranial depressions and discusses hypotheses of homology for each of them. His arguments are sound
36 and clearly presented and we thus adopt his ideas as hypotheses of primary homology for the definition of the
37 following two characters. Understanding the homologies of the endocranial fossae in actinopterygians is
38 difficult and we strongly recommend reading Bjerring (70) for a complete argumentation of his hypotheses of
homology, which are being followed in this work.
39
It is important to note that Allis ((71): p. 8) distinguishes the “temporal fossa of fishes is a hole formed by
40
the more or less complete roofing, by dermal bones, of the temporal groove on the dorsal surface of the
41
primordial cranium”. More correctly, Bjerring (70) and other authors (e.g. (72, 73)) use the term fossa referring
42 to the endocranial depressions.
43 As defined by Bjerring ((70): p. 232) the fossa supra-auditiva “is a depression in the external surface of the
44 otic region of the endocranium, situated dorsal to the lateral semicircular duct and lateral to the anterior and
45 posterior semicircular ducts”. It has been labelled in different ways by different authors (e.g. in Amia: ‘post-
46 temporal fossa’ by Patterson (51, 73), or ‘fossa bridgei’ by Jarvik (75)). The fossa supra-auditiva is either
47 present or the condition is unknown in the taxa included in our data matrix, so its presence is uninformative
48 for our analysis.
49
50
51
4.4. Foramen for the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX)
52 The braincase in †Pteronisculus, †Australosomus, †Boreosomus ossifies in a few pieces, which are not directly
53 comparable with the individual bones that form in neopterygians. In these fishes, the glossopharyngeal nerve
exits the ventrolateral wall of the otic region within a groove for the vena jugularis, which is called the jugular
54
depression. The IX-foramen in †Pachycormus macropterus is in the opisthotic, also in the anterior end of the
55
jugular groove ((76): p. 54), and this condition is autapomorphic for this taxon in our data matrix.
56
The passage of the glossopharyngeal nerve through the otic walls of the neurocranium of Amia is
57 described in detail by Allis ((77): p. 683): “It passes above the ramulus papillae lagenae acustici, under the
58

Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 6 of 41
ramulus ampullae posterioris acustici, between the sacculus and the sinus utriculi posterior … and issues from
the cranium by its foramen …, which lies immediately behind the hind edge of the petrosal, in the angle
1 between that edge and the ventral edge of the posterior process of the bone. The foramen lies entirely in the
2 cartilage of the cranium, but its front and upper edges are formed by the petrosal”. The shape of the prootic
3 and intercalar bones in †Calamopleurus cylyndricus is remarkably similar to the condition in Amia calva
4 (compare (23): figs. 24 and 303) and there is no evidence for the IX-foramen in any of the bones at the
5 lateroventral wall of the otic region, which is mostly unossified. Thus, we assume that the glossopharyngeal
6 nerve in †Calamopleurus cylyndricus exits the braincase in the same way as in Amia calva. Similarly, the same
7 condition is interpreted for all those amiinae halecomorphs, in which this region of the braincase is well
8 preserved. In Amia calva and †Calamopleurus cylyndricus, there is a foramen in the posterior region of the
9 intercalar ((23): figs. 24C, 28 and 303), which according to Allis ((77): pl. 21) corresponds to the exit of the
10 supratemporal branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve.
11 The foramen for the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) pierces the prootic bone in ginglymodians, most non-
12 amiinae halecomorphs and early Mesozoic teleosts such as aspidorhynchiforms, †Siemensichthys macrocephalus,
13 †Dorsetichthys bechei, and †Leptolepis coryphaenoides. Instead, in more derived teleosts, like †Tharsis dubius and
14 teleocephalans, the IX-foramen is in the exoccipital. Among the taxa included in our analysis, †Ionoscopus
cyprinoides is the only species in which the IX-foramen is enclosed at the anterior end of the intercalar (78).
15
Patterson and Rosen ((79): ch. 26) defined an a/p character for the presence of the “foramen for the
16
glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) in exoccipital rather than in prootic”, which was later used in Arratia ((58): ch. 20
17
App. 3) and, with slightly rephrased definition in several cladistic analyses (e.g., (61): ch. 20, (62): ch. 19, (29):
18 ch. 32, (39): ch. 37). All these examples include unspecified absences (44) with Amia scored equal to Lepisosteus
19 and early Mesozoic teleosts with the absence character state.
20
21
22 4.5. Foramen for the the vagus nerve (X)
23 The fissura otico-occipitales is open in the braincase of our outgroup taxa †Pteronisculus, †Australosomus, and
24 †Boreosomus, and in †Watsonulus eugnathoides. Therefore, there is no foramen for the vagus nerve (X), which
25 exits through the fissure in these fishes. The otico-occipital fissure is closed in more derived actinopterygians,
26 and the vagus nerve exits the cranium through a foramen through one of the bones of the occipital region. In
27 most halecomorphs and most basal teleosts, the X-foramen is surrounded by the intercalar and the exoccipital
28 bones. In ginglymodians, the halecomorphs †Calamopleurus cylyndricus and †Oshunia brevis, and in the teleosts
29 †Catervariolus, †Varasichthys, and the Teleocephala, the X-foramen is completely enclosed by the exoccipital.
†Pachycormus macropterus presents a condition unique among the studied taxa, in which the vagus nerve exits
30
the braincase through a foramen between the opisthotic and the intercalar.
31
The position of the foramen for the vagus nerve has been used for cladistic analyses in variably coded
32
characters. Our coding (character 24) is taken from Gardiner et al. ((80): ch. 5 App. 1) and Hurley et al. ((4): ch.
33 9), who use a multistate character representing the position of the exit of the vagus nerve. Their character state
34 0, “anterior to exoccipital” is equivalent to our character state 0 “through the fissura otico-occipitalis”, though
35 we modified its formulation to make it more precise and descriptive. Their character state 1 “lateral
36 outgrowths from intercalar form lateral margin” is not represented in our data matrix. Their character state 2,
37 expressed as ventral outgrowths from intercalar lateral margin “enclose ventral margin” in (80), or “enclose
38 dorsal margin in” in Hurley et al. (4) is equivalent to our character state 1 “between intercalar and
39 exoccipital”, which is more flexible because the shape of the intercalar outgrowths varies intra- and
40 interspecifically and, thus, they contribute in different ways to the rim of the X-foramen. Finally, their
41 character state 3 “enclosed by exoccipital” is the same as our character state 2. The character state 1 of these
42 authors is problematic because it was scored for †Pachycormus in Gardiner et al. ((80): ch. 5 App. 1), which
43 does not agree with Mainwaring (76), or for Polypterus in Hurley et al. ((4): ch. 9), but the bone enclosing the X-
44 foramen in this fish is not the intercalar but the opisthotic according to Allis (81) and Claeson et al. (82).
45 Most other authors (e.g. (83): ch. 3, (67): ch. 11, (59): ch. 25, (61): ch. 21, (84): ch. 2, (26): ch. 3, (29): ch. 33)
46 only include an a/p character coding the presence of the X-foramen in the exoccipital (our state 2) thus
47 producing an unspecified absence (44) when equally scoring Amia (here state 1), †Watsonulus (here state 0),
and sometimes also †Pachycormus (here state 3) with the state ‘absence’.
48
49
50 4.6. Intercalar
51 According to Patterson ((74): p. 315), the intercalar bone is homologous to the cranio-spinal process present in
52 the outgroup taxa †Pteronisculus, †Australosomus and †Boreosomus (47, 85) and in the halecomorph †Watsonulus
53 eugnathoides (86) and the ginglymodian †Ticinolepis crassidens (37). Patterson further interpreted that a dermal
54 component develops from this endochondral core, which is homologous with the fully dermal intercalar in
55 teleosts above the level of †Leptolepis coryphaenoides. Following Patterson’s hypothesis of homology, we coded
56 the a/p character 33 for the presence of an intercalar (chondral or dermal), and characters 34 and 35
57 representing different conditions observed regarding the development and relationships of the dermal
58

1
2
3 component of the intercalar. In our character 33, we distinguish the intercalar without extensive dermal
4 outgrowths (state 0; Fig. 2A) from the intercalar with outgrowths contacting the prootic (state 1; Fig. 2B) or
5 with extensive outgrowths contacting prootic and parasphenoid (state 2; Fig. 2C). We do not code the
disappearance of the chondral component of the intercalar because it is almost impossible to evaluate this
6
feature in fossils.
7
Olsen and McCune ((83): chs. 9, 21) and Brito ((67): chs. 9, 10) score the presence/absence of a chondral
8
intercalar and the presence/absence of and intercalar with dermal outcrops in two independent characters.
9 This way, both, the complete absence of an intercalar (e.g. Lepisosteus) is incorrectly scored the same as the
10 presence of a dermal intercalar (e.g. Amia) in their state ‘absence of a chondral intercalar’.
11
12
13 4.7. Hyomandibular facet
14 There is much variation regarding the bones involved in the articulation of the hyomandibula with the
15 neurocranium, so we have defined character 39 including six states summarizing the observed variation. In
16 †Caturus furcatus there is a single bone forming the lateral wall of the endocranium, which has been identified
17 as a large prootic (87), but might be the result of the fusion between the prootic and opisthotic (88). Due to this
18 uncertainty, this character is score as ‘missing data’ (?) for †Caturus furcatus. In most other halecomorphs the
19 facet for articulation of the hyomandibula is formed in cartilage (ch. 39[0]) (23). The cartilage is not preserved
20 in fossils, but the condition can be inferred. Among the taxa studied, only in †Macrepistius the facet for the
hyomandibula is completely included in the opisthotic (ch. 39[1]) (interpretation of this bone according to
21
Maisey (78)). The condition in †Pachycormus macropterus, in which all the bones of the lateral wall of the
22
neurocranium are involved in the formation of the hyomandibular facet (ch. 39[2]) (77), is unique among the
23
studied taxa. Among teleosts, the facet is formed by the sphenotic, pterotic and prootic bones (ch. 39[3]) in the
24 more basal forms and in Brycon and Hiodon, but the prootic is not involved in the facet in the other teleost taxa
25 in our data matrix. The facet is formed by the pterotic and sphenotic (ch. 39[5]) in most of these species, or by
26 the pterotic only in †Notelops and †Eberichthys (ch. 39[4]).
27 Several authors have coded the inclination of the hyomandibular facet in variably defined morphological
28 characters. For example, Gardiner and Schaeffer ((89): ch. 20) coded de presence/absence of horizontal facets
29 and Coates ((90): ch. 27) coded posteroventrally vs. ventrally oriented facets. The common problem with
30 previous attempts to distinguish between different degrees of inclination of the hyomandibular facet is that
31 there is no clear indication of the reference against which the measurement should be taken. To solve this
32 problem, for our character 40 “Orientation of hyomandibular facet respect to the parasphenoid axis”, we have
33 taken as reference the orientation of the orbital portion of the parasphenoid, which is the most constant
34 structure reflecting the anteroposterior axis of the head in actinopterygian braincases. Contrary, the
35 postorbital portion of the parasphenoid is very variable not only in extension, but also in orientation.
36 To define the character states, we have been able to take measurements of the angle between the main axis
37 of the hyomandibular facet and the longitudinal axes of the orbital portion of the parasphenoid in 26 taxa.
38 This information is represented in Figure 3, which shows a gradual change for angles below 50° followed by a
significant gap between 50° and 60°. This pattern agrees with previous ideas concerning a significantly
39
inclined vs. an almost horizontal hyomandibular facet, the latter only present in neopterygians (89). Our
40
character states are thus defined around this gap. However, this hypothesis should be tested in a more
41
comprehensive analysis of the variation of this feature among non-neopterygian actinopterygians, which
42 might reveal facets oriented with angles larger than 50°, or they might refute our hypothesis with values
43 filling the gap observed in this study. In such a case, this feature should best be treated as a continuous
44 character.
45 The hyomandibular facet is not directly observable in several taxa because it is formed in cartilage (see
46 above), or it is hidden by other bones in fossils. In such cases, scoring the variation in the orientation of the
47 hyomandibular facet is still possible through a rough estimation within the ranges proposed in the two
48 character states when the parasphenoid and the head of the hyomandibula are well visible and preserved in
49 situ.
50 An alternative coding proposed by Xu and Wu ((68): ch. 36) is a character including three states based on
51 ranges of angular values representing the orientation of the suspensorium. However, the orientation of the
52 suspensorium is independent and does not directly reflect the inclination of the hyomandibular facet (see
53 Gardiner and Schaeffer (89): pp. 145-146). Such a variation would thus represent a separate character, but we
54 think that the inclination of the suspensorium is not an independent feature but a direct consequence of the
55 position of the lower jaw articulation (character 69).
56
57 4.8. Dermosphenotic and dermal component of the sphenotic
58
59 R. Soc. open sci.
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 8 of 41
The presence of a dermal component of the sphenotic is discussed by Bartram (91) and this feature has been
used in several cladistic analyses [e.g. (5): ch. 23, (26): ch. 7, (68): ch. 16, (29): ch. 10, (27): ch. 34, (33): ch. 75).
1 The character is discussed by Grande ((5): p. 760), who clearly distinguishes the condition in the
2 †obaichthyids, in which the sphenotic is fused to the dermosphenotic, but scores the presence of a sphenotic
3 dermal component for these taxa. However, the dermal component of the sphenotic in other neopterygians is
4 an ossification independent from the dermosphenotic. The best example of the independence of these two
5 ossifications is found in the living gars, in which the dermosphenotic and the exposed portion of the sphenotic
6 are well separated by suborbital bones (see examples in Grande (5)). Therefore, the two conditions are not
7 homologous and are thus here coded as different characters (chs. 41 and 42, respectively).
8 The fusion between dermosphenotic and sphenotic is also equated with the dermal component of the
9 sphenotic and incorrectly scoring the presence this latter feature in †Obaichthys and †Dentilepisosteus in Arratia
10 ((29): ch. 10), Cavin et al. ((27): ch. 34), Bermúdez-Rochas and Poyato-Ariza ((92): ch. 7), and other papers
11 using those data matrices.
12
13 4.9. Lateral dermethmoids
14
Characters 47 and 48 are based on the hypotheses of homology between the rhinal bone, the nasal process of
15 the premaxilla in halecomorphs and ginglymodians (Fig. 4A,B), and the lateral dermethmoids of teleosts,
16 which are discussed and summarized in López-Arbarello ((26): p. 38) and thoroughly discussed in Patterson
17 (74). According to Patterson ((74): 510) “the pholidophorid premaxilla and lateral dermethmoid are together
18 the exact topographic homologues of the premaxilla and its nasal process” and the lateral dermethmoids in
19 †Siemensichthys macrhocephalus (Fig. 4C) or †Dorsetichthys bechei are homologous of the lateral dermethmoid
20 component of the compound mesethmoid of †Leptolepis coryphaenoides (Fig. 4D) and more derived teleosts.
21 According to this hypothesis, among the taxa included in this analysis, the lateral dermethmoids might be
22 present or absent (ch. 47). If present, they might be forming the nasal process of a single premaxilla (Fig. 4A,B)
23 or they might be toothed and separated from a pair of small premaxillae (Fig. 4C), or they might be forming
24 part of a compound mesethmoid ossification including chondral and dermal components (Fig. 4D) (ch. 48).
25
26
27
4.10. Parasphenoid processes
Two ascending processes are identified in early actinopterygians: processus ascendens anterior and posterior
28
(e.g. (46, 47, 73, 75, 93-95)). The processus ascendens posterior is more widely present among actinopterygians
29
and it is usually referred to as the ascending process (e.g. (23, 52, 74, 96-99)). The processus ascendens anterior
30 is related to the processus basypterigius of the neurocranium ((46): 273; (47): 105, 324), and it is usually
31 referred to as the basipterygoid process (e.g. (96)), especially in neopterygians (e.g. (5, 23, 74)).
32 The basipterygoid process of the parasphenoid (processus ascendens anterior) is poorly developed in
33 several taxa including †Boreosomus (47, 99), and Amia and other halecomorphs (23, 75), and it is absent in
34 several actinopterygians including the chondrosteans †Birgeria (85), †Condorlepis (100), †Chondrosteus (103),
35 and †Acipenser (102), but also in †Australosomus (85), and †Perleidus (46, 99). The absence of this process is
36 probably related to the poor development or complete absence of a processus basypterigius in the
37 neurocranium in these taxa.
38
39
40
4.11. Quadratojugal
41 The homologies of the quadratojugal bone of actinopterygians, which is probably not homologous with the
quadratojugal of sarcopterygians (103), have been debated by several authors. Among non neopterygian
42
actinopterygians, the quadratojugal is a small dermal bone attached to the palatoquadrate and it contains a
43
pit-line (e.g. see detailed descriptions and illustrations of the quadratojugal in †Mimipiscis toombsi and
44
†Moythomasia durgaringa in Gardiner (96)). In Ginglymodi the bone identified as the quadratojugal is a splint-
45 like dermal ossification lying along the dorsal margin of the preopercle, with an anterior head that buttresses
46 the articular process of the quadrate and a posterior spine-like portion (see López-Arbarello (26): fig. 3). The
47 symplectic articulates between the quadrate and the posterior spine-like portion of the quadratojugal. The
48 homology between the splint-like quadratojugal of ginglymodians and the plate-like quadratojugal of other
49 actinopterygians has been supported by several authors (e.g. (51, 104, 105)).
50 In teleosts and in most halecomorphs there is no independent quadratojugal, which is considered absent in
51 halecomorphs, but fused to the quadrate in teleosts. Among these fishes, no ossification resembling the
52 quadratojugal has been found in halecomorphs (except for those with a distinct plate-like quadratojugal), but
53 the strengthened posteroventral margin of the teleost quadrate has been considered homologous to the
54 quadratojugal (e.g. (26, 51, 52, 71, 74, 105-112)).
55 Our characters 70 to 72 are coded based on the hypotheses of homology between the plate-like
56 quadratojugal of non-neopterygian actinopterygians and a few basal neopterygians, the splint-like
57 quadratojugal of ginglymodians and the posteroventral border of the teleost quadrate. Character 70 refers to

2
3 the complete absence of a quadratojugal, which only occurs in halecomorphs and †Boreosomus piveatau
4 amongst the taxa included in our analysis. The fusion of the quadratojugal with the quadrate is coded in our
5 character 71 and character 72 distinguishes the plate-like from the splint-like quadratojugal. Therefore,
characters 71 and 72 are inapplicable for most halecomorphs because they do not have a quadratojugal (70[0])
6
and character 72 is also inapplicable for teleosts because the shape of the quadratojugal cannot be established
7
due to its complete fusion with the quadrate.
8
After a thorough revision of the osteology of †pachycormiforms and †aspidorhynchiforms, Gouiric-Cavalli
9 (113) concluded that in these fishes the quadratojugal is absent and the symplectic participates in a double-jaw
10 articulation resembling the condition in Amia calva. We agree with this author in the presence of a double jaw
11 articulation in the specimen SNSB-BSPG AS.VII.1069 of †Belonostomus speciosus and the same condition has
12 been reported in †Vinctifer comptoni (67). However, the symplectic does not rich the jaw in JME 1997.III.6 (Fig.
13 5A–B) or other examined specimens of †Aspidorhynchus acutirostris (e.g., SNSB-BSPG 1964.XXIII.542; Fig. 5D–
14 E), in which these bones are well preserved and exposed. Both in †Belonostomus speciosus (SNSB-BSPG
15 AS.VII.1069) and †Aspidorhynchus acutirostris (JME 1997.III.6, SNSB-BSPG 1964.XXIII.542), the bone tissue at
16 the posteroventral border of quadrate is different and partially separated from the rest of the quadrate, and it
17 is here considered as a quadratojugal (Fig. 5).
18
19
20
4.12. Infraorbital bones
López-Arbarello ((26): p. 11) discusses the homologies between the bones carrying the infraorbital sensory
21
canal. Without exception, these bones develop in connection with one or more neuromasts (104, 109, 114-116),
22
but the association of each of these bones with particular neuromasts of the infraorbital sensory line is not
23
possible because the number of neuromasts in this sensory line is highly variable (109), even between the left
24 and right sides of the same specimen of an individual (104). Nonetheless, the rostral, antorbital and
25 dermosphenotic have a different developmental timing respect to the rest of the series and can be
26 distinguished because of their association with particular segments of the cephalic sensory canals ((26); Fig. 6).
27 The rostral bone is associated to the ethmoidal commissure and the presence of the ethmoidal commissure
28 in potentially compound bones (states 0, 2, and 3) indicates fusion of the rostral with other ossifications ((117,
29 118); e.g. †Leptolepis coryphaenoides, Fig. 4D). The complete absence of any trace of the ethmoidal commissure
30 or a median ossification separate from the compound bones indicates that the neuromasts involved in the
31 ethmoidal commissure or in the ethmoidal pit line do not induce any ossification and, thus, there is a real
32 absence of a rostral bone.
33 The antorbital bone is associated with the junction between the infraorbital and supraorbital canals and it is
34 adjacent to the rostral in holosteans and basal teleosts. In more derived teleosts however, there are no separate
35 bones anterior to the lachrymal or there is only a small bone in the position of the antorbital, but it has no
36 sensory canals or pit-lines. This latter bone is considered homologous to the antorbital bone (58).
37 The dermosphenotic carries the last portion of the infraorbital sensory canal and it is placed at the
38 posterodorsal corner of the orbit. In most neopterygians the dermosphenotic is loosely attached to the frontal
and dermopterotic, laying on the sphenotic, but it is tightly sutured and incorporated into the skull roof in
39
several halecomorphs. The dermosphenotic might be fused to or separate and distant from the sphenotic in
40
some taxa (see above).
41
The series infraorbital bones between the antorbital and the dermosphenotic should be treated as a whole
42 (26). Among them, four regions can be distinguished for the sake of comparison: the anteroventral, ventral,
43 posteroventral and posterior margins of the orbit. The number and/or shape of the infraorbital bone or bones
44 involved in each of these regions have long been used in actinopterygian systematics and they have received
45 different names according to their position (e.g. (5, 23)). To facilitate comparisons we adopt this terminology,
46 but without direct implication of taxic primary homology for the individual bones. Accordingly, the terms
47 lachrymal, subinfraorbitals, jugal and postinfraorbitals are used in reference to the bones involved in each of
48 the regions previously indicated (Fig. 6).
49
50
51
4.13. Vertebral centra
52 The composition of the vertebral centrum is still very poorly understood in fossil neopterygians, except for
53 some teleost taxa (29, 59, 1190-121). Three main tissues, product of different mineralization processes, might be
involved in the ossification of the vertebral centrum: arcocentrum, chordacentrum and autocentrum. Other
54
authors (e.g. op. cit.) have attempted to define different vertebral types according to the different combination
55
of tissues involved in the ossified centrum. Here, we proposed a completely different approach based on the
56
general hypothesis that each of these three tissues develops independently from each other, i.e., the presence
57
58

60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 10 of 41
of one tissue does not implies the presence or absence of any of the other tissues. Consequently, we propose
three independent characters (chs. 225-227) scoring the presence/absence of each of these tissues.
1 The vertebrae in our out-group taxa †Pteronisculus and †Boreosomus, but also in the basal halecomorph
2 †Watsonulus and, as far as known, in most ginglymodians outside Lepisosteoidea (†Semionotus elegans,
3 †Paralepidotus ornatus, †Isanichthys lertboosi, †Thaiichthys buddhabutrensis, †Araripelepidotes temnurus) is only
4 formed by the dorsal and ventral arcual elements and the centrum does not ossify. Therefore, none of these
5 tissues is present in the vertebral centra of these taxa.
6 The arcocentrum is an endochondral ossification derived from the dorsal and ventral arcualia. The crescent
7 shape hemicentra of the vertebrae of the halecomorph †Caturus has been interpreted as hemichordacentra (23,
8 122, 123). However, after close examination of specimens we agree with Laerm ((120): p. 195) on that the
9 hemicentra of caturids (clearly visible in the specimen NHMUK PV 20578 of †Caturus furcatus) are
10 endochondral ossifications (225[1]). Similarly, the ring-like centra of †Ophiopsiella (previously †Ophiopsis, see
11 (124)) has been thought to be formed by a cylinder of chordacentrum surrounded by autocentrum (91). Laerm
12 (120) question this hypothesis because the inner ring of the vertebral centra of †Ophiopsiella is ossified instead
13 of being mineralized as it is the case of the chordacentra in other actinopterygians. Gardiner et al. (80) consider
14 the drum-like centra of †Ophiopsiella are homologous with the centra in Amia. We therefore follow the latter
authors and scored state (225[2]) for this taxon.
15
The vertebral centra of Amia, state (225[2]), is formed by endochondral replacement of cartilaginous arch
16
base and intercalated anlagen (120, 125, 126). In the abdominal region, the centra are monospondylous and
17
result of perichordal ossification of the interdorsal and basiventral arcualia. The diplospondylous centra of the
18 caudal region are formed by fusion of the interdorsal and interventral, and basidorsal and basiventral
19 arcocentra.
20 Among gars, the development of the holospondylous vertebrae has been studied in Lepisosteus (120, 127-
21 130), in which the centrum is mainly formed by endochondral replacement of a continuous perichordal tube of
22 cartilage derived from the dorsal and ventral arch anlagen (120, 130). This condition corresponds to our
23 character state (225[2]). The solidly ossified opistocoelous centra of other fossil and living gars resemble the
24 centra of Lepisosteus and there is no reason to suspect a different composition. The hemicentra of †Scheenstia
25 mantelli are expanded arcocentra according to Patterson ((51): p. 294). Interestingly, the vertebral centra of
26 †Macrosemius rostratus are perichordally ossified and continuous with the parapophysis, but not with the
27 neural arches (SNSB-BSPG AS I 770, (91): p. 157) thus resembling ontogenetic stages of Amia.
28 The vertebral centra of aspidorhynchids and some Jurassic teleosts like †Siemensichthys is formed by
29 annular chordacentrum surrounded by the dorsal and ventral arcocentra (123, 131).
30 The chordacentrum is the result of mineralization within the fibrous sheath of the notochord and it is the
31 only component of the vertebral centra in several basal teleosts (226[1]). The chordacentrum in basal teleosts
32 (e.g. †Annaichthys, †Pholidophoretes; (29)) might form complete rings (†Ichthyokentema, †Catervariolus; (132, 133))
33 or might be represented by dorsal and/or ventral hemichordacentra (†Eurycormus, †Parapholidophorus,
†Pholidoctenus, †Pholidorhynchodon; (29, 134)). The hemichordacentra however, usually fused to form complete
34
rings (†Pholidophorus; (29)), so we consider this variation is ontogenetic. Apart from these basal teleosts, the
35
only other taxon with vertebral centra formed by mineralized chordacentrum in our data matrix is
36 †Australosomus kochi (46, 85).
37 The centra of living teleosts is mainly formed by direct membranous ossification of the sclerotomal
38 perichordal tube (autocentrum), though chordacentral and arcocentral remnants are variably present (120, 123,
39 135, 136).
40
41
42 4.14. Epurals
43 The term epurals refers to the series of median rod like bones placed posterior to the last fully developed
44 neural spine in the caudal skeleton of actinopterygians. Epurals has been interpreted as homologous to
45 detached neural arches (137-140) homologous with radials (141-143), or homologous with the supraneurals
46 (144, 145). Comparing with the series of epurals in the Triassic †Pteronisculus, †Australosomus and other
47 actinopterygians, and considering the one-to-one relationship between these bones and the neural arches in
these fishes, Patterson ((146): pp. 220-221) concluded that the epurals are detached neural spines, which he
48
considers homologous to the anterior series of supraneurals. However, the homology between supraneurals
49
and neural spines has been questioned (147, 148).
50
Schultze and Arratia (131, 136) and Arratia and Schultze (148) restrict the term epurals to the median bones
51 placed dorsal to the neural arches of preural and ural centra in teleosts, interpreting them as detached neural
52 spines, which they don’t consider homologous to supraneurals. These authors further distinguish the ‘epurals’
53 in Amia and other neopterygians, rejecting the homology between these elements and the epurals of teleosts.
54 In Amia and other halecomorphs (e.g. †Ionoscopus cyprinoides; see examples in Grande and Bemis (23)), the
55 most anterior ‘epurals’ intercalate with the complete neural spines of the last preural vertebrae, but the more
56 posterior epurals (only one in Amia, two in †Ionoscopus cyprinoides) are placed directly dorsal to short ural
57 neural spines and/or ural neural arches, as is the case of the epurals in teleosts. Both ‘epurals’ and epurals are

3 also present in non neopterygian actinopterygians like Polyodontidae (149) and Polypteridae (5) and the
4 question of homology between these elements and between them and the supraneurals remains open.
5 For the present study, we follow Schultze and Arratia (131, 136) and coded two independent a/p
characters for the epurals (ch. 265) corresponding to the median bones posterior to the completely developed
6
neural spine and interpreted as detached neural spines, and ‘epurals’ (ch. 267) corresponding to the median
7
bones intercalating between the complete neural spines, which are attached to their corresponding neural
8
arches. Accordingly, the median elements in the caudal skeleton of †Australosomus and †Pteronisculus are
9 epurals (47, 85). Among the taxa included in our analysis, ‘epurals’ are only present in halecomorphs and
10 pachycormiforms.
11 The ‘epurals’ of pachycormiforms need a special discussion. These elements are placed dorsal to a series of
12 median bones named “uroneural-like elements” by Lambers (150), which are interpreted as modified neural
13 arches and spines of several preural and ural vertebrae (151). Accordingly, since the neural spine is involved
14 in the formation of the “uroneural-like elements”, the dorsal series is interpreted as ‘epurals’ in
15 pachycormiforms (151).

4.15. Uroneurals, ‘posterior uroneurals’ and urodermals
19 The name uroneural was given by Regan ((141): p. 355) to the modified ural neural arches in Elops and
20 Megalops, which are elongated paired bones spreading along the dorso-lateral surface of the last preural and
ural centra. The term was later brought to some confusion with the term urodermal (see below), but Patterson
21
((146): pp. 221-231) clarifies the use of both terms, fixing the name uroneurals to the series of paired elongated
22
bones flanking the dorsolateral surfaces of pre-ural and/or ural vertebral centra, which represent modified
23
ural neural arches.
24 A series of uroneural bones is present in †Eurycormus. Arratia and Schultze ((134): p. 32; also in (131): table
25 3) distinguish the first element in this series as an uroneural-like bone assuming it represents the modified
26 neural arch of the last preural centrum. Although the authors do not explain the reasons for this
27 interpretation, it might be related to the absence of a neural arch on the last preural centrum in this fish.
28 However, although possible, this absence does not necessarily imply that the first element in the series of
29 uroneurals truly corresponds to the first preural centrum and we thus do not make this distinction.
30 The uroneurals in †Tharsis dubius are described as forming two series (Fig. 7). The bones forming the
31 anterior series are clearly uroneurals as described in character 273. The second series is formed by three bone
32 splints, which have a different orientation and are placed more laterally than the anterior uroneurals. All or
33 some of these bones are overlapping the bases of the most dorsal principal caudal fin rays in some specimens
34 and, thus, their homology with uroneurals or urodermals (see discussion of character 294) is unclear. Pending
35 a more detailed study to clarify the homology of these bones, we here code an independent character to
36 analyse the presence of such ‘posterior uroneurals’ among the taxa studied.
37 The homology between the series of reduced rhomboid scales flanking the bases of the uppermost
38 principal caudal fin rays in Jurassic teleosts and the rhomboid scales in the body lobe of the heterocercal tail of
some non-neopterygian actinopterygians was first proposed by Nybelin (138). Nybelin however, did not
39
distinguish between these elements and the series of modified ural neural arches (i.e. uroneurals), which he
40
also interpreted as derived from rhomboid scales that became (phylogenetically) absorbed and associated to
41
the axial skeleton. Nybelin thus proposed the name urodermalia for the two series. Patterson (146) restricted
42 the term urodermals to the posterior series, which represent modified rhomboid scales, and, following Regan
43 (141) reaffirmed the term uroneurals for the anterior series, which represent modified ural neural arches.
44 Patterson (146) further discussed the homology between the urodermals and the patches of rhomboid
45 scales in the reduced body lobe of Early Jurassic teleosts and accepted the homology between them and the
46 scales in the body lobe of the heterocercal tail as proposed by Nybelin (138). Following this hypothesis, we
47 accept the homology between the few modified scales, with or without ganoine layer, which are flanking the
48 base of the most dorsal principal caudal fin rays in several teleosts and halecomorphs, the body of which is
49 naked or covered with elasmoid scales, and the scales in the complete body lobe of the heterocercal and
50 abbreviated heterocercal tails of other actinopterygians.

4.16. Serrated appendages and clavicles
The term ‘serrated appendages’ was coined by Wilder (152) for the thin, toothed ossifications placed on each
54
side of the isthmus, anterolateral to the cleithrum in Amia calva. These appendages develop independently and
55
“have no connection with either cranial or postcranial bone or muscles” ((153): 522). Only the posterior
56
serrated appendage abuts against the cleithrum, which has a similar microscopic composition of cellular bone
57

bearing oblique denticle-bearing ridges ((153): 528). At least the posterior serrated appendage has been
considered homologous with the clavicle of other actinopterygians (72, 153-155).
1 Erroneously, the term ‘serrated appendage’ has been used ((29): 125) for the ornamented lateral surface of
2 the cleithrum in several Triassic and other teleosts, though she clearly distinguishes this structure from the
3 condition in amiiforms. We agree with Arratia on the equivalence of the condition in the Triassic teleosts and
4 toothed ridges on the cleithrum of †Watsonulus and †Atacamichthys, but there is no evidence for these
5 structures developing as separate appendages. On the contrary, and in agreement with the observations of
6 Liem and Woods (153), these toothed ridges are part of the cleithrum (our character 325).

9 5. Phylogenetic Analyses
10 The equal weighted cladistic analysis resulted in 24 most parsimonious trees (MPTs) of 2175 steps, with a
11 consistency index of 0.268 and a retention index of 0.678. The strict consensus of the 24 most parsimonious
trees is represented in Figure 8. The consensus shows a generally well-resolved phylogenetic hypothesis with
12
a monophyletic crown-Neopterygii including monophyletic Teleostei and Holostei. Bremer decay indexes and
13
Bootstrap supports for all nodes are indicated in Figure 8. In this phylogenetic hypothesis, several taxa (e.g.
14
†Thrissops formosus, †Caturus furcatus) took an unexpected position (see discussions below). We thus run
15 implied weighting analyses to explore the effect of homoplasies in our hypothesis. These analyses were
16 performed with a moderate down-weighting K-value of 8 and strong K-value of 3 and the corresponding strict
17 consensus trees are represented in Figure 9 (Bremer and Bootstrap values for these cladograms are included in
18 the Supplementary File S3).

21 5.1. Systema9c posi9on of †Ticinolepis
22 The monophyly of †Ticinolepis including two species, †T. longaeva and †T. crassidens, is confirmed with one
23 unique and four homoplastic synapomorphies (Supplementary File S4) and the genus is recovered as the
24 sister-taxon of all other ginglymodians (Fig. 8). This phylogenetic position is stable also in the hypotheses
25 given by implied weighting analyses, in which †Dapedium is included at the base of Ginglymodi. The latter
26 relationship and, thus, the monophyly of Ginglymodi is supported by two unique synapomorphies: the
presence of a splint-like quadratojugal (ch. 72[1]) and anterior infraorbital bones (ch. 130[1]). The node is
27
further supported by four homoplastic characters. The ectopterygoid is crescent shaped (ch. 62[1]) in
28
Ginglymodi except lepisosteoids, but also in †Pachycormus macropterus and in some teleosts (†Ebertichthys,
29
†Tharsis dubius, †Luisiella feruglioi). The antorbital bone excluded from the margin of the orbit (ch. 139[0]) is the
30 condition shown by all studied ginglymodians, but also several halecomorphs and some teleosts. The
31 subopercle is shallow (ch. 203[1]) in all ginglymodians except †Pliodetes and more derived gars, but it is also
32 shallow in most halecomorphs and teleosts. The median gular is absent in all ginglymodians except
33 †Kyphosichthys (ch. 208[0]).
34 López-Arbarello et al. (37) discuss several morphological features shared by †Ticinolepis and the
35 halecomorphs. Some of these features like the relatively large broad nasal bones (ch. 106[0]) or the presence of
36 a well-developed medial wing of the cleithrum (ch. 324[1]) are plesiomorphic conditions also present in other
37 neopterygians and in the out-group taxa, but the presence of a supramaxillary notch (ch. 162[3]) and a
38 branchiopercle (ch. 206[1]) are uniquely derived within Holostei (see below). The series of very shallow scales
39 covering the ventrum in †Ticinolepis (ch. 10[1]) is, as indicated by López-Arbarello et al. (37) also present in
40 some halecomorphs (†Archaeosemionotus, †Ophiopsis, †Ophiopsiella), but it also occurs in †Aspidorhynchus (156)
41 and the out-group taxon †Australosomus (85).
42 The resemblance discussed by López-Arbarello et al. (37) between the braincase of †Ticinolepis and several
43 halecomorphs are mostly plesiomorphic (e.g. the presence of well-ossified lateral ethmoids; ch. 46[0]).
44 Similarly, a large, vertically oriented ascending processes of the parasphenoid, which articulate with the
sphenotic (ch. 54[0]), is the condition present in all studied halecomorphs, but also in the basal teleost
45
†Catervariolus and the out-group taxa †Australosomos and †Pteronisculus. The facet for the articulation of the
46
hyomandibula in †Ticinolepis is formed between the sphenotic, prootic and pterotic bones (ch. 39[3]), which is
47
also de case in the halecomorph †Caturus furcatus (NHMUK 20578), but also in the basal teleosts †Catervariolus
48 (133), †Ichthyokentema (132) and †Dorsetichthys (74). The participation of bones in this facet (ch. 39) is highly
49 variable among the taxa studied, but the state in †Ticinopelis is probably the plesiomorphic condition. The
50 condition in the out-group taxa †Australosomos, †Boreosomus and †Pteronisculus, and in †Watsonulus is not
51 comparable because there are no separate bones in the braincase of these fishes. Unfortunately, the braincase
52 of other basal taxa like †Plesiofuro and the most basal halecomorphs †Archaeosemionotus, †Robustichthys and
53 †Panxianichthys is unknown.
54 Resembling the amiids, the frontals of †Ticinolepis cover the orbital and large part of the temporal regions
55 of the skull, with more than 1/3 of the length extending behind the orbit (ch. 103[1]). According to our
56 cladistic analysis, this pattern is acquired independently in these two groups and in the halecomorphs
57 †Caturus furcatus and †Watsonulus eugnathoides and in the teleost †Rhacolepis buccalis among the studied taxa.

3 The same state is present in †Australosomus, †Pteronisculus and †Plesiofuro, suggesting these are reversals to a
4 plesiomorphic condition.
5 López-Arbarello et al. (37) noticed the presence of a descending lamina in the dermopterotics (ch. 96[1]) of
†Ticinolepis and discussed the distribution of this feature in other actinopterygians. Although this trait is
6
common among halecomorphs, the condition in most taxa is unknown and the known distribution among the
7
taxa included in our analysis is rather patchy.

10 5.2. Holostei Monophyly
11 Differing from all previous studies, our phylogenetic analysis includes numerous representatives of the main
12 crown-neopterygian clades: Gynglimodians (36 taxa), Halecomorphi (25 taxa) and Teleostei (29 taxa). This
13 more comprehensive data set was necessary to explore the relationships of †Ticinolepis due to its uncertain
14 systematic assessment caused by the mixture of morphological features discussed by López-Arbarello et al.
15 (37). The resulted phylogenetic hypothesis (Fig. 8) shows a monophyletic Holostei including Halecomorphi,
16 Ginglymodi and †Dapedium, which is supported by two homoplastic synapomorphies: the presence of four or
17 more suborbital bones (ch. 144[1]), which is also found in †Knerichthys browni; and the presence of a
18 presupracleithrum (ch. 320[1]), which is also present in †Pteronisculus and might be a reversal because
19 presupracleithra are known in several Palaeozoic and Triassic non-neopterygians (reversed also in
20 †Pachycormus macrocephalus).
The following node corresponds to the clade formed by Halecomorphi and Ginglymodi, which we could
21
call the crown-Holostei, is well supported by seven synapomorphies. Among them, the presence of a tapering
22
canal bearing anterior arm of antorbital bone (ch. 137[1]) is uniquely derived in Holostei, which was
23
previously proposed as a synapomorphy of this clade by Hurley et al. ((4); ch. 32[1]), who described it as the
24 shape of the antorbital “tapering towards slender anterior process; tri-radiate canal within broader, posterior,
25 portion”, and Grande ((5); ch. 12[1]). Two other synapomorphies are also uniquely derived in Holostei: a
26 supramaxillary notch (ch. 162[3]), and a branchiopercle (ch. 206[1]). The supramaxillary notch, which was first
27 noticed and described by Grande and Bemis (23), derives at the base of the crown-Holostei, it is lost in most
28 ginglymodians (present in †Ticinolepis, †Kyphosichthys) and halecomorphs, but it derives again and is a
29 synapomorphy of Amiinae. Similarly, the branchiopercle is present in all the studied halecomorph taxa except
30 †Quetzalichthys, in the most basal ginglymodians †Ticinolepis and †Sangiorgioichthys, but it is lost in most
31 ginglymodians and derived again in macrosemiids and the callipurbeckiids †Occitanichthys and †Tlayuamichin.
32 The remaining four synapomorphies supporting the crown-Holostei are also homoplastic and
33 independently derived outside Holostei: a relatively long dermopterotic (ch. 93[1]), nasal bones that are not
34 excavated by the posterior nostril (ch. 109[3]), two supraorbital bones (ch. 115[2), and a maxilla with a straight
35 ventral margin (ch. 159[0]). The shape of the pelvic bones in †Ticinolepis, with flat proximal end and widened
36 anteriorly (ch. 336[0]), which is different in the out-group taxa and all studied teleosts except †Eurycormus, is
37 another potential synapomorphy of Holostei.
38 Among previous morphological phylogenetic studies, Hurley et al. (4) propose the monophyly of Holostei
based on three synapomorphies. Among them, the shape of the antorbital was already discussed and it is here
39
confirmed. The second synapomorphy relates to the shape of the rostral bone and would be equivalent to our
40
state 0 of character 141 (relatively small approximately rectangular to tube-like), which is not given as a
41
synapomorphy by the algorithm because the ancestral condition cannot be resolved in our data matrix. The
42 third synapomorphy refers to the shape of the brain “optic tectum larger than telencephalon” ((4): ch. 66),
43 which is not included in our data set.
44 Grande (5) proposes 13 synapomorphies for Holostei including the already discussed features of the
45 antorbital and rostral bones (chs. 137 and 141). Most of the other features mentioned as synapomorphies of
46 Holostei in Grande’s analysis are found in more derived positions in our analysis and might have supported
47 this clade in his analysis due to the more restricted sample of taxa. Among these other characters, the lack of a
48 pterotic bone (ch. 37) derives independently in gars and the Triassic teleosts, and the presence of a small
49 dermal component of the sphenotic (ch. 41[1]) derived independently in halecomorphs and some
50 ginglymodians; the distribution of this feature is patchy within this latter clade. Similarly, the presence of
51 large premaxillary nasal processes enclosing the olfactory foramen (ch. 152[1]) and the suture of the nasal
52 processes of the premaxillae with the frontal bones (ch. 153[1,2]) are independently derived in amiiforms and
53 ginglymodians above the level of †Ticinolepis. The presence of paired vomers (ch. 59[0]), a compound coronoid
54 process (ch. 169), and the presence of fringing fulcra on the caudal fin (ch. 298[0]) are plesiomorphic for
55 Neopterygii. The presence of serrated appendages (ch. 328[1]) is difficult to evaluate in fossils and in many
56 cases, it is impossible to be certain about their absence. As far as we have been able to evaluate it, this feature
has a rather patch distribution, but only within Holostei. Serrated appendages are known in Amia calva and
57

Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 14 of 41
†Caturus furcatus among halecomorphs, and in living gars, †Semionotus elegans and †Propterus elongatus among
ginglymodians.
1 Other features proposed by Grande (5) are potential synapomorphies of Holostei, but more data is needed
2 to understand the evolution of these characters because the ancestral condition cannot be resolved in our
3 analysis. Among these, four hypobranchials (ch. 211[1]) are known only in †Pachycormus macrocephalus outside
4 Holostei, and the lateral dermethmoids forming the nasal processes of the premaxilla (ch. 48[0]) is apparently
5 unique of holoteans, but the condition of the lateral ethmoids is so far unknown outside Holostei or Teleostei.
6
7
8 5.3. Relationships among crow-neopterygians
9 Within Holostei, the patterns of relationships of ginglymodians and halecomorphs mostly agree with previous
10 hypotheses. Above the series of Triassic stem-taxa, the Ginglymodi split in the orders Lepisosteiformes and
11 †Semionotiformes as proposed by López-Arbarello (26). Differing from this and the more recent study by
López-Arbarello and Wencker (36), and in agreement with Sun and Ni (42), the Middle Triassic †Kyphosichthys
12
and †Sangiorgioichthys are not semionotiforms but join the tree at the stem to the node (Lepisosteiformes,
13
†Semionotiformes). In our analysis, †Ticinolepis also join the tree at this stem as the most basal Ginglymodi
14
and, thus, we find now useful to distinguish the clade (Lepisosteiformes, †Semionotiformes) as the
15 Neoginglymodi, defined as the clade including Lepisosteus and †Semionotus, and all descendants of their most
16 recent common ancestor. The Ginglymodi remain defined as proposed by López-Arbarello ((26): 34): the clade
17 including all taxa more closely related to Lepisosteus than to †Dapedium, Amia or †Pholidophorus.
18 In the hypothesis of Sun and Ni (42), the stem-Neoginglymodi †Kyphosichthys and †Sangiorgioichthys form a
19 clade they called Kyphosichthyidae, which is not retrieved in our analysis. Apart from the addition of
20 †Ticinolepis in our study, the taxonomic sample is different in the two cladistic analyses. In addition to
21 †Kyphosichthys and †Sangiorgioichthys Sun and Ni (42) include †Luoxiongichthys hyperdorsalis Wen et al., 2012
22 (157), a still poorly understood taxon also from the Anisian of South China, which is not included in our data
23 set. On the other hand, those authors include only two species of †Sangiorgioichthys, †S. aldae from the
24 Ladinian of the Monte San Giorgio (Swiss and Italian Alps) and †S. sui from the Anisian of South China, but
25 we also include †S. valmarensis also from the Ladinian of the Monte San Giorgio (Swiss Alps). A fourth species
26 of this genus, †S. yanjuanensis, also from the Anisian of South China, is incompletely known and not yet
27 included in any cladistic analysis. Although these taxonomic differences could explain the different results,
28 the putative synapomorphies supporting this clade are questionable according to the distribution of characters
29 in our hypothesis. The putative synapomorphies of Kyphosichthyidae are: “triangular suborbital lateral to
quadrate” ((42): 17) is uniquely derived in †Sangiorgioichthys (ch. 150[1]) and absent in †Kyphosichthys;
30
“infraorbital bones forming the ventral border of the orbit subtriangular, broader ventrally, about 2 times
31
deeper than long” ((42): 17) is the condition found in †Kyphosichthys and many other ginglymodians (ch.
32
127[0]), but not in the species of †Sangiorgioichthys (127[2,3]); “nasal process of the premaxilla not pierced by a
33 large foramen for the olfactory nerve” ((42):17) is a plesiomorphic holostean condition (ch. 152[0]). This latter
34 feature is further unknown in †Kyphosichthys and the species of †Sangiorgioichthys, except for †S. sui where the
35 nasal process of the premaxilla encloses a complete olfactory foramen (GMPKU-P-1707), which is trait is a
36 synapomorphy of ginglymodians above the level of †Ticinolepis (ch. 152[0]).
37 Sun and Ni (42) further argue that the genus †Sangiorgioichthys sensu López-Arbarello et al. (158) is not
38 monophyletic because the sister taxon of †S. sui is †Kyphosichthys grandei and not †S. aldae. In our analysis
39 however, the clade form by the three species of is well supported by one uniquely derived character, the
40 quadrate laterally covered by one or two suborbitals forming a triangular plate (ch. 150[1]), and three
41 homoplastic synapomorphies: a single anterior infraorbital bone (ch. 131[0]), otherwise only present in
42 †Araripelepidotes temnurus; the dorsal margin of the maxilla gently concave allocating supramaxilla (ch. 162[2]),
43 a condition unique of this genus among the studied ginglymodians, but present in most teleosts and a few
44 halecomorphs; and the coronoid process of the lower jaw is completely formed by the surangular (ch. 169[2]),
45 which is a rather rare condition otherwise known in the gars and the Triassic teleost †Pholidoctenus serianus. In
46 our hypothesis, †Kyphosichthys grandei is the sister-taxon to Neoginglymodi and this relationship is supported
47 by four synapomorphies: the presence of the longitudinal articulation of the scales of the body (ch. 8[1]), the
above discussed shape of the infraorbital bones forming the ventral margin of the orbit (ch. 127[0]), the
48
absence of a branchiopercle (ch. 206[0]), and the relatively low posttemporal bones, which are approximately
49
as high as the dermopterotic (ch. 316[1]).
50
The monophyly of Neoginglymodi is supported by one uniquely derived sinapomorphy: the presence of
51 increasingly large and stout basal fulcra in the dorsal fin and six homoplastic synapomorphies
52 (Supplementary File S4), and the relationships within this clade generally agree with López-Arbarello and
53 Wencker (36), showing monophyletic Lepisosteoidei and †Lepidotidae within Lepisosteiformes, and
54 †Callipurbeckiidae, †Macrosemiidae and †Semionotidae within †Semionotiformes. However, the relationships
55 between some of these clades, or some taxa within these clades, is variable indicating that more taxa and
56 characters still need to be added to achieve a more robust phylogenetic hypothesis. For example, the
57 relationships of the genus †Isanichthys from the Late Jurassic of Thailand remained unresolved in López-

3 Arbarello (26), Cavin et al. (27) and Deesri et al. (31, 32), the species †Isanichthys palustris is the most basal
4 lepisosteoid in López-Arbarello and Wencker (36), but the two species of this genus are included in
5 †Lepidotidae in the hypotheses presented here (Figs. 8-9), though the relationships of the taxa within
†Lepidotidae are variable in the implied weighting analyses. Similarly, according to Cavin et al. (27) and
6
Deesri et al. (31, 32), the Early Cretaceous †Thaiichthys buddhabutrensis, also from Thailand, is the sister-taxon
7
of a clade formed by the Early Cretaceous †Pliodetes from Africa and †Araripelepidotes from Brazil, which is the
8
sister-group of the superfamily Lepisosteoidea sensu López-Arbarello (26). However, this clade is not resolved
9 in our analysis or in López-Arbarello and Wencker (36), and all those taxa are stem-Lepisosteoidea (Fig. 8). In
10 this case, the relative position of these stem-taxa remains the same in both implied weighting analyses (Fig. 9).
11 Very interestingly, the Early Cretaceous †Neosemionotus puntanus from Western Argentina is here retrieved as
12 the most basal lepisosteiform (Fig. 8) as indicated in 89% of the most parsimonious trees in López-Arbarello
13 (26). Contrary, the implied weighting analysis with the strongest constant value of 3, suggests that this taxon
14 is the most basal †semionotiform (Fig. 9B). In any case, as López-Arbarello (26) already stated, the basal
15 position of †Neosemionotus, with a ghost lineage going back to the Triassic indicates that the history of the
16 ginglymodians in South America is much longer than currently known. Ginglymodians are well represented
17 in the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous of Brazil and Argentina (159-161) but no reliable evidence of their
18 presence have been found before that time (162). This missing information certainly plays a role regarding the
19 uncertainties about the phylogenetic relationships of †Neosemionotus.
20 Among †Semionotiforms, although the clade †Macrosemiidae is very well supported in all cladistic
21 analyses, the relationships of this family vary from a position more basal than †Semionotidae or
22 †Callipurbeckiidae in the earlier studies (26, 27, 31, 32, 68, 84, 92, 163), macrosemiids are the sister-group of
23 †Semionotidae in a clade that is the sister group of †Callipurbeckiidae in López-Arbarello and Wencker (36),
but they are the sister-group of †Callipurbeckiidae in our hypotheses (Figs. 8–9).
24
In Halecomorphi, the relationships within Amiidae, as well as the basal position of the Triassic taxa
25
generally agree with previous cladistic analyses. Contrarily, the order †Ionoscopiformes is not monophyletic
26
in our hypotheses, including the cladograms produced by the implied weighting analyses (Figs. 8–9). The
27 name Ionoscopiformes was coined by Grande and Bemis (23) to name a clade including the families
28 †Ionoscopidae, †Ophiopsidae, and †Oshunidae. Later authors do not recognize the monotypic family
29 †Oshunidae and placed †Oshunia brevis within †Ionoscopidae together with †Ionoscopus cyprinoides and
30 †Quetzalichthys perilliatae (24, 41, 164). In the hypotheses proposed by these authors (33, 165), this clade
31 †Ionoscopidae is the sister-group of †Ophiopsidae including the genera †Ophiopsis (previously †Furo)
32 muensteri, †Ophiopsiella (previously †Ophiopsis), †Macrepistius and †Teoichthys, forming a monophyletic
33 †Ionoscopiformes. Xu et al. (33) described the Triassic †Robustichthys, retrieved as the oldest †ionoscopiform in
34 a polytomy with †Ionoscopidae and †Ophiopsidae, and Xu and Shen (164) described the slightly younger
35 †Panxianichthys, retrieved as the sister-taxon to all other †ionoscopiforms. After adding the Triassic
36 †Allolepidotus, †Asialepidotus, and †Eoeugnathus to the analysis, Sun et al. (41) proposed very different
37 relationships for †Panxianichthys and proposed a clade †Panxianichthyiformes including all these Triassic taxa
38 (except †Robustichthys, which is not included in their analysis). On the other hand, López-Arbarello et al. (34)
39 redescribed the Triassic †Archaeosemionotus connectens and proposed another different phylogenetic hypothesis
40 including a monophyletic †Ionoscopiformes, but the family †Ionoscopidae is not monophyletic and the sister-
41 group of †Ophiopsidae is the clade †Furidae including †Ophiopsis (previously †Furo) muensteri,
†Archaeosemionotus, and †Robustichthys, the latter taxon thus taking a significantly more derived position
42
compared to the studies mentioned before. The disparities between all these studies indicate that the different
43
sets of taxa and characters produce incompatible results for the relationships of the taxa classified in the order
44
†Ionoscopiformes and the results obtained in our cladistic analysis might be understood as the result of
45 merging those previous data sets. In our hypotheses, the families †Ionoscopidae and †Ophiopsidae are
46 monophyletic, but they are not sister-groups, and the Triassic †Archaeosemionotus, †Robustichthys, and
47 †Panxianichthys are retrieved at the base of the Halecomorphi, as well as the Early Triassic †Watsonulus (Figs.
48 8–9). However, the other Triassic taxa †Allolepidotus, †Asialepidotus, and †Eoeugnathus are not included in our
49 analysis and, thus, nothing can be said about the monophyly of †Panxianichthyformes sensu Sun et al. (41),
50 which will be explored in a future study (López-Arbarello in preparation).
51 Another unexpected result of our analysis is the phylogenetic position of †Caturus furcatus outside the
52 Amiiformes and within the †ionoscopid clade (Figs. 8, 9A). This sister-group relationship between †Caturus
53 and †ionoscopids is supported by six homoplastic synapomorphies and only in the result of the strongest
54 implied weighting (k = 3) †Caturus is retrieved at the amiiform clade (Fig. 9B) as suggested by previous
55 studies (e.g. (23, 34, 166)). Including other taxa like †Heterolepidotes, †Osteorachis, †Ainia (= †Callopterus),
56 which are potentially closely related to †Caturus (23, 51) in future cladistic analyses will certainly solve the
57 phylogenetic position of this taxon.

In agreement with the most recent phylogenetic hypothesis for basal teleosts (39), according to our results,
the genera †Aspidorhynchus and †Pachycormus are sister-taxa and together represent the sister-group of all
1 other teleosts (Fig. 8). Similarly, all Triassic teleosts form a monophyletic clade †Pholidophoridae sensu Arratia
2 (29). The Jurassic †Eurycormus, †Dorsetichthys, and †Siemensichthys join the stem Teleocephala, but at different
3 positions relative to each other compared to previous hypotheses (29, 35), or †Eurycormus is not on this stem,
4 but is the sister-group of †Pholidophoridae in Arratia (39). Recalling the family †Leptolepidae sensu Nybelin
5 (167), †Leptolepis coryphaenoides and †Tharsis dubius are more closely related to each other than to any other
6 teleost in our analysis (Fig. 8). The clade including these taxa also includes †Luisiella feruglioi, from the Late
7 Jurassic of Argentina, and is supported with three uniquely and four homoplastic synapomorphies and it is
8 stable also in the hypotheses given by the implied weighting analyses (Fig. 9). The characters uniquely derived
9 in this Leptolepid-clade include the presence of a preopercular process of the hyomandibula (Fig. 10) and
10 broad neural and haemal spines with a median groove (Fig. 7). The hyomandibula with a preopercular
11 process was already recognized as diagnostic of his Leptolepidae s. str. (†Leptolepis, †Proleptolepis and †Tharsis)
12 by Nybelin (167) and at least some of these features are present in the other members of the family
13 †Luisiellidae (†Cavenderichthys (168) and †Waldmanichthys (169)). Although several Jurassic teleost taxa are
14 missing in our data matrix compared to previous studies, in particular the other members of the Gondwanan
family †Luisiellidae (35), the close phylogenetic relationships between these taxa might be the result of
15
expanded character sampling and a new understanding of character change evolution on the teleost lineage
16
due to the inclusion of numerous non-teleost fossil taxa in our analysis.

19 6. Conclusions
20 The present study was designed and conducted to solve the phylogenetic relationships of the genus
21 †Ticinolepis, including two species, †T. longaeva and †T. crassidens, which is retrieved as the most basal
22 Ginglymodi. †Ticinolepis is known from the earliest to late Ladinian while other more derived taxa are known
23 from the Anisian, thus indicating a ghost lineage of at least 5 Ma at the base of Ginglymodi (Fig. 11: Node 3).
24 The pattern of phylogenetic relationships and the chronostratigraphic distribution of the studied taxa
25 indicates a rapid radiation of the holostean clades Halecomorphi (Fig. 11: Node 2) and Ginglymodi during the
26 approximately 15 Ma encompassed by the Early and Middle Triassic, immediately followed by a first rapid
27 radiation of pholidophoriform teleosts (Fig. 8) during the late Middle and Late Triassic. A second important
28 radiation of ginglymodians and teleosts took place independently during the Early Jurassic. The lepidotids
29 within Ginglymodi and the leptolepid-clade within Teleostei (Fig. 8), represent offshoots of their respective
main stems during that period of time. In contrast, the crown-group Halecomorphi (Fig. 11: Node 5) present
30
an enormous ghost lineage throughout most of the Mesozoic from the Middle Triassic to the early Late
31
Jurassic. All three main clades Halecomorphi, Ginglymodi and Teleostei (Fig. 11: Nodes 2–4) experienced a
32
third important radiation during the Late Jurassic giving rise to their respective crown-groups (Fig. 11: Nodes
33 5–7).
34 Our data matrix, like most previous evolutionary studies of Mesozoic actinopterygians is strongly biased
35 because most of the included taxa come from a few main Mesozoic Lagerstätten, which might be responsible
36 for the hypothetical pattern of radiations briefly described above (Fig. 12). Consequently, more taxa from
37 other geographic and stratigraphic provenance should be incorporated into the analysis to achieve more
38 robust hypotheses about the evolution of neopterygians during the Mesozoic.
39 The Early–Middle Triassic radiation of neopterygians however, has been thoroughly explored and
40 documented by Romano et al. (170) and it is part of what they called ‘The Triassic actinopterygian revolution’.
41 This first important radiation of the crown-Neopterygii was apparently facilitated by the demise of several
42 chondrichthyan clades and driven by the successful acquisition of several feeding, locomotory and
43 reproductory innovations in the early members of the Holostei and Teleostei (170-172). Several of these key
44 innovations were also acquired by the so-called subholosteans, allegedly as a consequence of convergent
45 evolution (171, 172). However, the systematic position of the taxa regarded as subholosteans and their
46 phylogenetic relationships with the crown-neopterygians are still unclear, and at least some subholostean
47 groups might be on the stem lineage to crown-Neopterygii Gardiner (89, 173-175). Therefore, the rapid
diversification of the early Mesozoic subholosteans and crown-neopterygians might be part of a single
48
radiation event and should thus not be treated as separate clades, as in most recent diversity studies (170, 176).
49
The hypothesis of a single radiation of Neopterygii including subholosteans is more consistent with published
50
diversity analyses (170), but it should be tested in a phylogenetic framework.
51 Based on the information provided by Romano et al. (170) in their Table S3 and after the addition of more
52 recently described taxa, we counted 262 species of crown-neopterygian and subholostean taxa in the Early and
53 Middle Triassic only, most of which have never been included in a cladistic analysis (Fig. 13). Pending
54 elucidation of the phylogenetic relationships of the numerous, still not cladistically studied taxa from the Early
55 and Middle Triassic, any hypothesis about the evolution of these groups is largely speculative.
56 Finally, one aim of this work has also been to provide a comprehensive data set to facilitate those utterly
57 needed phylogenetic studies. We have merged previously existing lists of characters, proposed several new

5 contribute with a critical approach, discussing and improving this data set with more than the addition of new
taxa.

The 339 characters listed below have been used for the cladistic analysis to explore the phylogenetic
relationships of the Middle Triassic genus †Ticinolepis. Among them, 76 characters are new (indicated
in blue), but the remaining characters have been emended from previous authors. In most cases,
corrections were necessary because the original characters have been proposed either for
gynglimodians, halecomorphs, or teleosts and they thus failed to represent the complete morphospace
encompassed in our data matrix. For this reason, although the emended characters refer to the same
trait, many of the newly defined character states are incompatible with those originally included by the
source authors.
Many characters have been corrected to avoid problematic coding as discussed by Jenner (1) and
Brazeau (2). In many cases, tracing back the author who first discussed a certain morphological
feature for taxonomic/systematic comparisons is a hopeless task and we might unfairly end up
acknowledging the wrong source. Therefore, the cited references correspond to the sources we have
used for the corresponding characters, which is not necessarily the first mention of the systematic
value of the morphological trait. We thus limit our references to the sources from which a given
character coding was taken and refer the readers to the literature cited therein. Several characters are
here proposed for the first time in a cladistic analysis, but not all of them are being used for the first
time in actinopterygian systematics. In these and many other cases, other literature is cited in the
discussion.
As explained in the Methods section of the manuscript, autapomorphic character states are not
deleted because such states, though not informative for the tree search, are informative concerning the
amount of homoplasy.

General features of the body and squamation
1. Relative position of the dorsal fin respect to the pelvic and anal fins
(0) originating posterior to insertion of pelvic and extending backwards not beyond middle of
anal fin
(1) originating approximately at the level of the origin of the anal fin and extending opposite
to it
(2) extending anterior to opposite of insertion of pelvic fins
(3) originating anterior to insertion of pelvic and extending opposite to anal fins
(4) originating posterior to the origin of anal fin
(5) originating posterior to insertion of pelvic and extending backwards up to end of anal fin
As presented here, this character is modified from López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 1). Character state 5 was
added by Thies and Waschkewitz ((4): ch. 1) to represent the condition in the species of †Dapedium.
López-Arbarello (3) scores character state 1 “dorsal fin opposite to anal fin” for the gars, but the
dorsal fin in living gars is placed a little backwards respect to the anal fin. Therefore, we now added
character state 4 to represent this condition more accurately.
2. Elongation of the rostral region anterior to the lower jaw symphysis
(0) does not extend anterior to the dentary symphysis significantly
(1) extends well anterior to the dentary symphysis by more than 50% of mandibular length
This character is taken from Grande ((5): ch. 4) to distinguish the remarkable condition of the head of
†obaichthyid gars.
We are aware that this character encompasses some variability from normal prognathism to
hypognathism within character state 0. However, the condition in †obaichthyids, which is also found
in most species of †Aspidorhynchus (6, 7) is so divergent from most other actinopterygians that it
blunts the comparably not significant degree of variation included in the other character state. For this
reason, we do not include the third character state “does not extend anteriorly beyond the lower jaw
symphysis” proposed by Thies and Waschkewitz ((4): ch. 9), which falls within the range of variation
accepted for our character state 0.
3. Ornamentation of the dermal bones of the skull
(0) ornamented with tubercles or ridges
(1) smooth or very slightly ornamented
(2) ornamented with sharp tubercles (odontodes) resembling conical teeth
This character is taken from López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 19) and summarizes the main three types of
ornamentation recognized for most actinopterygians. The variation from tubercles to ridges is usually
present within a single bone and whether one or the other type of ornamentation is dominant varies
between regions of the same skull and between individuals of the same species. It is thus impossible to
distinguish between tubercles and ridges in different character states. The very distinct kind of
ornamentation described in our character state 2 is found in obaichthyid gars and in †Pliodetes among
the taxa included in our data matrix. It has been compared with the dermal denticles in the
clupeomorph teleost Denticeps, though these might not be homologous with the odontodes of other
vertebrates (8).
Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 8) is equivalent to our character states 0 and 1, without distinguishing
our state 2, which is not present in their data set. Grande ((5): ch. 2) is equivalent to the
presence/absence of the condition described in our character state 2 and, thus, implies an unspecified
absence (1).
4. Type of scales
(0) ganoid
(1) elasmoid of amioid type
(2) elasmoid of cycloid type
From Brito ((6): ch. 38).
5. Shape of posterior margin of cycloid scales
(0) smooth
(1) crenulated
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 176). Among basal teleosts, the posterior margin of the cycloid scales is
generally smooth. However, in the Late Jurassic varasichthyids, in †Pachythrissops, basal
elopomorphs (e.g. Elops), and a few fossil euteleosts (e.g. †Leptolepides sprattiformis) the posterior
margins of the scales are crenulated.
6. Posterior margin of ganoid anterior flank scales
(0) Smooth (Fig. 1C, G)
(1) serrate or dentate (Fig. 1B, D, E, H)
(2) spiny, with a few small spines (Fig. 1A, F)
Modified from Arratia ((11): ch. 159) by adding character state 2 to represent the conditions found in
several ginglymodian taxa. The characteristic of the scales with a strong posteriorly directed spine was
proposed in Grande ((5): ch. 38) as an independent a/p character, which involves an unspecified
absence state.
7. Vertical peg-and-socket articulation
(0) well developed (Fig. 1A–D, F)
(1) reduced (Fig. 1E, G–H)
From Gardiner and Schaeffer ((12): ch. 3). Xu et al. (13) erroneously score the presence of peg-and-
socket articulation in †Leptolepis coryphaenoides, which not possible because this taxon has cycloid
scales.
8. Longitudinal articulation of the scales of the body
(0) absent (Fig. 1A–B)
(1) present (Fig. 1C–H)
9. Mode of longitudinal articulation of the scales
(0) small anterodorsal process (Fig. 1C)
(1) strong anterior dorsal process (Fig. 1D, G–H)
(2) double, anterior dorsal and ventral processes (Fig. 1E–F)
This character is modified from López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 86) by splitting her character state 1 “only a
strong dorsal anterior peg for the longitudinal articulation”, to distinguish it from the presence of a
small anterodorsal process in some of the studied taxa (†Australosomus, †Archaeosemionotus,
†Boreosomus, †Obaichthys, †Ophiopsis, †Panxianichthys, †Plesiofuro).
10. Squamation of the ventrum
(0) not significantly different from the rest of the body
(1) numerous horizontal rows of distinctly shallow scales (Fig. S2-1)
First notice among halecomorphs (14), the rhomboid scales covering the ventrum are notably
shallower and clearly distinct from the other scales covering the rest of the body in several of the
studied taxa (†Australosomus, †Archaeosemionotus, †Aspidorhynchus, †Ophiopsiella, †Ophiopsis,
†Ticinolepis).
Figure S2-1: Ventral squamation in A, †Archaeosemionotus connectens (PIMUZ A/I 552 dusted with
ammonium chloride) and B, †Ophiopsiella attenuata (JME ETT.1896). Scale bars = 2 cm.
11. Dorsal ridge of scales between the skull and the dorsal fin
(0) absent
(1) present
12. Shape of the dorsal ridge scales
(0) with a low spine
(1) with a high spine
The presence of a dorsal ridge of scales was proposed by Olsen and McCune ((15): ch. 17) as a
distinct feature for “semionotids”. López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 83) added the variation in the shape of the
dorsal ridge scales forming a multistate character, which we here split in the characters 11 and 12
following the recommendations of Brazeau (2).
Variations in the shape of dorsal ridge scales of several species of †Semionotus are thoroughly
analysed by McCune (16), but these are all different morphologies of scales with high spines thus
corresponding to our character state “with a high spine”.
Endocranium, parasphenoid and vomer
13. Fossa parampullaris of Bjerring (17)
(0) absent
(1) present
Defined by Bjerring ((17): p. 234) the fossa parampullaris is a depression in the endocranium of the
Devonian coelacanthiform †Nesides schmidti “situated lateral to the ampulla of the posterior
semicircular duct and dorsal to the posterior part of the lateral semicircular duct”, and it is placed
“dorsal to the parampullar process”. According to this author, the depression identified as the ‘post-
temporal fossa’ by Patterson (18) in †Dorsetichthys bechei is not homologous with the
‘Temporalgrube’ of Sagemehl ((19): p. 200, fig. 5). Instead, based on its topographic relationships and
the presence of a foramen for the supratemporal nerve of the lateralis system, this depression is
homologous with the fossa parampullaris observed in †Nesides schmidti. As indicated above, we refer
the readers to the work of Bjerring (17) for a more complete explanation of his hypotheses of
homology.
14. Bones participating in the posterior end of the fossa parampullaris of Bjerring (17)
(0) intercalar
(1) exoccipital
(2) autopterotic
(3) epioccipital
Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 12) is a multistate character coding the bones surrounding the posttemporal
fossa. We here distinguish between the bones involved in the posterior end of the fossa parampullaris
(this character) from those roofing this portion of the fossa (next character), which according to
Bjerring (17) hypotheses of homology should be treated independently. The fossa parampullaris is an
endocranial depression, the development of the bones that ossify in the fossa is independent from the
bones that might growth covering it.
In our data matrix, character states 1 and 3 (posterior end of the fossa parampullaris in the
exoccipital or epioccipital) are autapomorphic for †Oshunia brevis and Salmo salar, respectively.
15. Bones roofing of the posterior opening of the fossa parampullaris of Bjerring (17)
(0) dermopterotic (or dermopterotic portion of pterotic)
(1) epioccipital
(2) parietal
(3) epioccipital and pterotic
(4) extrascapular and dermopterotic
Character state 2 is autapomorphic of †Thrissops formosus in our data matrix.
16. Spiracular canal
(0) present
(1) absent
Taken from Gardiner and Schaeffer ((12): ch. 32). Arratia ((20): ch. 14 App. 3), which includes a
“greatly reduced” intermediate state. However, this intermediate state is only scored in †Leptolepis
coryphaenoides in Arratia (20, 21), or in †L. coryphaenoides and †Tharsis dubius in Arratia (22), or in
†L. coryphaenoides and is polymorphic (greatly reduced or absent) in †Tharsis dubius in Arratia (11,
23-26) and Arratia and Tischlinger (27). The intraspecific variation in †Tharsis dubius indicates that
the intermediate condition is probably due to ontogenetic variation and, thus, pending a more detailed
study of this issue, we excluded the intermediate character state and scored both †L. coryphaenoides
and †Tharsis dubius with missing data (?).
17. Supraoccipital bone
(0) absent
(1) present
From Arratia ((21): ch. 5).
18. Supraoccipital crest
(0) absent or poorly developed
(1) present, well developed
19. Shape of the supraoccipital crest
(0) spine-like
(1) high and triangular
The supraoccipital is a small median bone with a poorly developed crest in Triassic and Jurassic
teleosts and in certain teleocephalan groups, like clupeomorphs, elopomorphs, euteleosts, and most
osteoglossomorphs (10, 11). A well-developed, spine-like supraoccipital crest (state 1) is present in
most ostariophysans (e.g. Brycon (28)) and in the Cretaceous †Notelops and †Rhacolepis (29, 30). A
high and triangular supraoccipital crest has appeared independently in Hiodon (31) and the
†Ichthyodectoidei, which are derived ichthyodectiforms (e.g. †Thrissops, †Cladocyclus), although it is
absent in other ichthyodectiform taxa, like †Allothrissops (32, 33).
Previous authors have proposed different characters representing the absence/presence, relative size
and shape of the supraoccipital crest ((30): chs. 6, 17, (34): ch. 3, (35): ch. 2, (33): chs. 9, 33, 35, 47,
(36): ch. 2, (37): ch. 13, (10): ch. 6). Among them, Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 6) gives the optimal
representation of the variation observed in the taxa included in our data matrix. However, to avoid
pseudo-ordering (2), we distinguish the presence of well-developed supraoccipital crest from its
different morphologies in two different characters.
Although our character state 19(0), supraoccipital crest “absent or poorly developed” technically
implies an unspecified absence (1), the distinction between the complete absence of the crest and the
presence of a poorly developed crest in fossils is usually not possible in the praxis, because in most
cases only a well-developed supraoccipital crest is discernible.
20. Supraotic bone
(0) absent
(1) present
From Gardiner et al. ((38): ch. 7 App. 2), but a thorough analysis of the homologies of the supraotic
bone and its distribution is done by Maisey (39).
21. Posterior process of epioccipital
(0) absent
(1) present
22. Development of posterior process of epioccipital
(0) small
(1) large
The “presence of a large posteriorly directed process on the "epiotic" …” was proposed by Olsen and
McCune ((15): p. 270) as a diagnostic character for their family “Semionotidae” including
†Semionotus and †Lepidotes. Current research (3, 40) indicates that these two genera do not form a
monophyletic group and this feature has a much broader distribution among neopterygians. A large
epiotic process is found in the semionotiforms †Semionotus elegans and †Macrosemimimus toombsi
((18): figs. 108–111), the lepisosteiform †Araripelepidotes temnurus, and in †“Lepidotes” gloriae
((41): fig. 6) among ginglymodians, but it is absent in other ginglymodians. A similar process is
present in other actinopterygians (e.g. Polypterus ornatipinnis (5): fig. 541). A small and blunt process
is present in all ginglymodians in which the feature is known, but it is also present in some
halecomorphs and teleosts.
23. Foramen for the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) placed in
(0) jugular depression
(1) prootic
(2) in cartilage, bordered by the prootic anteriorly and dorsally
(3) exoccipital
(4) intercalar
(5) opisthotic
Modified from Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 13). We added character states 0, 2, 4 and 5 to represent the
condition observed in the taxa included in our analysis, and excluded their character state 2 (IX-
foramen in the basioccipital bone) because it is not represented in our data matrix.
24. Exit of the vagus nerve (X) placed
(0) through the fissura otico-occipitalis
(1) between intercalar and exoccipital
(2) in exoccipital
(3) between intercalar and opisthotic
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 14), though their character states 2 and 3 (exit of the vagus nerve in the
basioccipital or between the intercalar and basioccipital, respectively) are not included because they
do not occur among the taxa included in this analysis.
25. Posterior extent of exoccipitals in adult-sized individuals
(0) reach posterior margin of occiput
(1) do not reach posterior margin of occiput
From Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 2).
26. Exoccipital forming concave articular facets
(0) absent
(1) present
In halecomorphs and in the teleosts †Dorsetichthys bechei ((18): fig. 55) and †Ichthyokentema
purbeckensis ((18): fig. 151), the posterior end of the exoccipital bones form two concave articular
facets, which in Amia calva articulate with the neural arch of the first vertebral centrum fused to the
basioccipital ((9): figs. 25, 37).
27. Exoccipital articular facets
(0) separated from basioccipital
(1) attached to basioccipital
The articular facets of the exoccipitals are clearly separated from the basioccipital in the halecomorphs
(e.g. (9): figs. 25, 37; (39): fig. 1), but they are tightly attached to this bone in the teleosts
†Dorsetichthys bechei ((18): fig. 55) and †Ichthyokentema purbeckensis ((18): fig. 151).
28. Exoccipital position relative to basioccipital
(0) dorsal
(1) anterodorsal
(2) anterior
The exoccipitals lay on the dorsal surface of the basioccipital in most taxa examined (e.g. (18): figs.
46, 95, 99, 108; (9): fig. 37). Within Ginglymodi however, the exoccipitals are placed anterodorsal
(Lepidosteidae) or anterior (†Obaichthyidae and †Araripelepidotes temnurus) to the basioccipital ((5):
41, 237, 476, 492–493; (42): figs. 1, 4). †Rhacolepis is the only teleost in our data matrix, in which the
exoccipital is not dorsal, but anterodorsal to the basioccipital ((29): fig. 13).
29. Foramina in basioccipital for occipital or spinal arteries
(0) present
(1) absent
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 15).
30. Posterior myodome
(0) absent
(1) present
From Gardiner and Schaeffer ((12): ch. 10). Other authors (e.g. (38): ch. 6 App. 1, (43): ch. 12)
include the absence of the posterior myodome within multistate characters dealing with different
characteristics of the posterior myodome.
31. Relative size of posterior myodome
(0) not extending into basioccipital
(1) extending into basioccipital
Modified from Brito ((6): ch. 4). These authors include the absence of a posterior myodome within
this character, which is here coded as an independent character (ch. 30) following the
recommendations of Brazeau (2).
32. Trajectory of the dorsal aorta in relation to the basioccipital
(0) passing through an ossified canal formed by the basioccipital
(1) passing through a median groove in the basioccipital
(2) canal or groove in the surface of the basioccipital absent
Taken from Hurley et al. ((43): ch. 16) (see discussion in (10): ch. 16), which is modified from
Patterson and Rosen ((32): ch. 27).
33. Intercalar
(0) present
(1) absent
From Hurley et al. ((43): ch. 7).
34. Dermal component of intercalar
(0) absent
(1) present
35. Extent outgrowths of dermal component of intercalar
(0) without extensive outgrowths (Fig. 2A)
(1) with outgrowths contacting prootic (Fig. 2B)
(2) with outgrowths contacting prootic and parasphenoid (Fig. 2C)
36. Opisthotic
(0) present
(1) absent
From Olsen and McCune ((15): ch. 5).
37. Pterotic
(0) present
(1) absent
Taken from Gardiner et al. ((38): ch. 13 App. 2). Gardiner et al. ((38): ch. 2 App. 1) is a multistate
character including the fusion of the pterotic with the dermopterotic in addition to the
presence/absence of the pterotic. We agree with Hurley et al. (43) on that the presence of the pterotic
and its fusion with the dermopterotic are two independent characters, but evaluating this fusion is very
difficult in most fossils so we did not include Hurley et al. ((43): ch. 4).
Grande and Bemis (9) score the presence of a pterotic in †Oshunia, but according to Maisey ((39):
p. 24) the pterotic is absent in this taxon and the bone interpreted as the pterotic by other authors is the
opisthotic. Similarly, according to Rayner (44), Jollie (45), Grande (5) a pterotic is absent in the gars
and the bone interpreted as the pterotic by Patterson (18) and Wiley (46) represents the epiotic.
38. Size of prootic
(0) large, well expanded above the VII-foramen (Fig. 2C)
(1) small, the dorsal border is close to the VII-foramen (Fig. 2B)
The prootic normally forms most of the anterior half of the lateral wall of the endocranium (state 0),
but in Amia calva and other amiiforms, the prootic is limited to the anteroventral quarter of the lateral
wall of the braincase.
39. Hyomandibular facet formed in
(0) cartilage
(1) the opisthotic
(2) the sphenotic, pterotic, prootic and opisthotic
(3) the sphenotic, prootic and pterotic
(4) the pterotic
(5) the sphenotic and pterotic
(6) the ventral surface of the dermopterotic
40. Orientation of hyomandibular facet respect to the parasphenoid axis
(0) forming an angle of more than 60°
(1) forming an angle of less than 50°
The character states are defined according to the measurements of the angle between the main axis of
the hyomandibular facet and the longitudinal axes of the orbital portion of the parasphenoid in 26 taxa
(Fig. 3). Among the taxa examined, there is a gradual change for angles below 50° followed by a
significant gap between 50° and 60°. Our character states are thus defined around this gap.
41. Sphenotic with small dermal component
(0) absent
(1) present
This feature is explained by Bartram (47) and used in several cladistic analyses [e.g. (5): ch. 23, (3):
ch. 7, (48): ch. 16, (11): ch. 10, (49): ch. 34, (50): ch. 75).
42. Sphenotic fused to dermosphenotic
(0) absent, the two bones are separate
(1) present
Among the taxa studied, the dermosphenotic is fused to the sphenotic only in †obaichthyid gars (5).
This character is related, though independent from character 121 because the fusion between the bones
is not possible in those taxa in which the dermosphenotic and sphenotic are not in contact with each
other (Atractosteus, Lepisosteus and †Massillosteus). Thus, character 42 is logically inapplicable for
those taxa.
43. Basisphenoid
(0) present
(1) absent
From Wiley ((46): ch. 17).
44. Orbitosphenoid
(0) median
(1) paired
In most actinopterygians the orbitosphenoid is a median bone, usually bifurcating posteriorly to
articulate with the paired pterosphenoids. In Amia calva and †Cyclurus kehreri, the orbitosphenoid is
paired (9).
45. Ventral extension of orbitosphenoid
(0) reaching the parasphenoid
(1) confined to the dorsal portion of the orbit
Modified from Arratia ((20): ch. 9 App. 3).
46. Lateral ethmoid ossifications
(0) present
(1) absent
The lateral ethmoid ossifications are widely distributed among actinopterygians (18). In the outgroup
taxa the ethmoid regions consists of a median nasal septum and the planum antorbitale (51), which
separates the orbit and nasal cavities. In agreement with Patterson ((18): p. 35), we think that the
lateral ethmoids are homologous to at least the lateral region of the planum antorbitale. A fully
ossified ethmoidal region with a planum antorbitale is also present in †Watsonulus eugnathoides.
The ethmoidal ossifications are absent in the gars and macrosemiids, but at least the lateral
ethmoids are present in †Araripelepidotes temnurus (42), †Lepidotes semiserratus (52), †Scheenstia
mantelli (18) and †Scheenstia zappi (53). Ethmoidal ossifications are also reduced in macrosemiids
((54), ALA pers. obs.).
47. Lateral dermethmoid ossifications
(0) absent
(1) present
48. Lateral dermethmoids relationship to other bones
(0) forming the nasal processes of a single paired premaxilla (Fig. 4A, B)
(1) forming toothed dermethmoids (Fig. 4C)
(2) forming part of a compound mesethmoid with chondral and dermal components (Fig. 4D)
López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 47) scores the absence of a nasal process in †Dapedium. However, after
reviewing the homologies of this feature, we now agree with Thies and Waschkewitz ((4): ch. 47) and
interpret the relatively short process in †D. stollorum as a small nasal process and, thus, homologous
with the lateral dermethmoids.
49. Width of parasphenoid anterior to the ascending processes
(0) the parasphenoid narrows towards its anterior end, but it is equally broad directly anterior
and posterior to the ascending processes (e.g. †Boreosomus piveteaui (51): fig. 67)
(1) approximately uniformly broad, as wide or wider than posterior to the processes (e.g.
†Siemensichthys macrocephalus (18): fig. 84)
(2) distinctly narrower than posterior to the processes (e.g. †Rhacolepis buccalis (29): fig. 15)
(3) the parasphenoid bar narrows directly in front of the ascending processes, but it broadens
distinctly anteriorly (e.g. †Macrepistius arenatus (55): fig. 7)
This character summarizes four main shapes of the anterior portion of the parasphenoid. State 0
represents the condition observed in the outgroup taxa †Pteronisculus, †Australosomus and
†Boreosomus. Most halecomorphs (e.g. Amia calva), several teleosts (e.g. †Pholidorhynchodon
malzanni, †Siemensichthys macrocephalus) present the condition described in state 1, whereas state 2
is found in lepisosteids and several teleosts. The condition described in state 3 has only been observed
in †Macrepistius and †Ichthyokentema among the taxa included in our data matrix, and seems to have
evolved independently in the two taxa.
50. Posterior extent of parasphenoid
(0) short, does not extend beyond the fissura oticalis-ventralis
(1) short, but extending beyond the fissura oticalis-ventralis
(2) long, reaching the occipital condyle or close to it
(3) very long, extending posterior to the occipital condyle
Modified from Gardiner et al. ((38): ch. 12 App. 1). We added character states 0 and 1 to represent the
conditions found in the outgroup taxa (†Australosomus, †Boreosomus, and †Pteronisculus).
Other authors also coded this feature. Brito ((6): ch. 14) and Xu and Wu ((48): ch. 7) include our
states 0–2, but not state 3. Coates ((56): ch. 36) state 0 is equivalent to our state 0, but his state 1
includes our states 1, 2, and 3. Arratia ((20): ch. 11 App. 3) and Arratia ((11): ch. 26) only
distinguishes a parasphenoid “extending posterior to basioccipital” (our state 3) and Arratia ((26): ch.
31) only distinguishes between the parasphenoid “short, reaching anterior margin of basioccipital” or
“long, extending posterior to basioccipital”. The second state of Arratia ((26): ch. 31) corresponds to
our state 3 and the scorings of the first state agree with our state 1, but we think that the anterior
margin of the basioccipital is not a good landmark due to the variation in the extent of the
parasphenoid along the ventral surface of the basioccipital.
51. Basipterygoid processes of parasphenoid
(0) almost or totally absent
(1) well developed
From Gardiner and Schaeffer ((12): ch. 30). Character state 0 includes both the poorly developed
processus ascendens anterior of †Boreosomus, or Amia, and other halecomorphs, and the complete
absence of the process in †Australosomus and †Perleidus because it might be impossible to
distinguish between the two conditions in many fossils and they might be functionally equivalent.
Gardiner and Schaeffer (12) scored the presence of a dermal basipterygoid process in
†Boreosomus, but as explained above, the process in this taxon is very poorly developed.
52. Ascending processes of parasphenoid
(0) present
(1) absent
From Patterson (57). The ascending processes or processus ascendens posterior are present in most
actinopterygian taxa and their absence in a few fishes like †Mimipiscis or the gars is interpreted as
secondarily derived (58, 59).
53. Orientation of the ascending processes of parasphenoid
(0) extend perpendicularly
(1) extend anteriorly
(2) extend posteriorly
This character representing the different directions in which the parasphenoid ascending process might
be oriented is taken from Hilton and Forey ((60): ch. 16).
54. Extent of the ascending processes of parasphenoid
(0) high, reaching the sphenotic (Fig. 2B–C)
(1) low, sutured to the prootic only (Fig. 2A)
From Gardiner et al. ((38): ch. 5 App. 2).
55. Laterally sliding articulation between the metapterygoid and the parasphenoid basipterygoid
process in adults
(0) absent
(1) present
From Grande ((5): ch. 59).
56. Parasphenoid tooth patch
(0) present
(1) absent
57. Parasphenoid tooth patch
(0) extends anterior and posterior to the ascending processes
(1) extends only anterior to the ascending processes
(2) extends only posterior to the ascending processes
(3) limited to the area between the ascending processes
Modified from Gardiner et al. ((38): ch. 11 App. 1). We have added character states to represent all the
observed variation.
58. Vomer(s)
(0) absent
(1) present
From Olsen and McCune ((15): ch. 26). Brito ((6): ch. 13) includes this and the following character in
a single multistate character, which is an alternative to our coding, though not recommended by
Brazeau (2).
59. Vomer in adults
(0) pair
(1) co-ossified
From Patterson ((61): ch. 8).
Palatoquadrate
60. Autopalatine bone
(0) present
(1) absent
From Grande ((5): ch. 64).
61. Dermopalatine(s) bone(s)
(0) separate
(1) fused to autopalatine
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 20). The character is inapplicable for those taxa in which the autopalatine
does not ossify (e.g. Hiodon).
62. Shape of ectopterygoid
(0) elongate, triangular, straight ventral border, deepest mid length (e.g. Amia calva (9): fig.
50)
(1) approximately crescent shape, convex dorsally, concave ventrally (e.g. †Macrosemimimus
fegerti (62): fig. 4)
(2) approximately boomerang shape (e.g. †Rhacolepis buccalis (29): fig. 16)
(3) approximately triangular, deepest posteriorly, tapering anteriorly (e.g. †Massillosteus
janeae (5): fig. 462, †Dentilepisosteus laevis (5): fig. 492)
(4) elongate, with bar-like anterior portion and deeply expanded posterior portion (e.g.
Lepisosteus osseus (5): figs. 60–61, Atractosteus spatula (5): figs. 254–255)
(5) bar-like (e.g. Hiodon alosoides (31): figs. 45–48)
Modified from López-Arbarello and Wencker ((40): ch. 11). We have reformulated the character
states to improve descriptive resolution and accommodate the morphologies observed in the taxa
included in our data matrix.
63. Marginal row of teeth on ectopterygoid
(0) absent
(1) present
The pterygoid bones of actinopterygians are usually paved with minor teeth. In addition, several
neopterygians have a marginal row of larger teeth, which are normally aligned with the teeth of the
dermopalatine bone or bones.
64. Ectopterygoid participation in palatal surface area
(0) ectopterygoid forms half or less of the palatal region
(1) ectopterygoid forms most of the palatal region
Taken from Grande ((5): ch. 63).
65. Part of dorsal surface of ectopterygoid ornamented and forming part of skull roof
(0) absent
(1) present
From Grande ((5): ch. 61).
66. Endopterygoid dentition
(0) present
(1) absent
From López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 15).
67. Metapterygoid/quadrate relationship
(0) metapterygoid sutured or closely associated with the quadrate
(1) ectopterygoid separating metapterygoid from quadrate
From Grande ((5): ch. 60).
68. Metapterygoid/ectopterygoid contact
(0) absent, bones separated by the endopterygoid (e.g. †Macrosemimimus fegerti (62): fig. 4)
(1) present, metapterygoid placed anteriorly (e.g. Amia calva (9): fig. 50)
(2) present, metapterygoid expanded anteriorly (e.g. †Rhacolepis buccalis (29): fig. 16)
(3) present, ectopterygoid enlarged posteriorly (e.g. Lepisosteus osseus (5): figs. 60–61,
Atractosteus spatula (5): figs. 254–255)
69. Relative position of the lower jaw articulation at the level of
(0) posterior to the orbit
(1) around the posterior border of the orbit
(2) around the centre of the orbit
(3) around the anterior border of the orbit
(4) in front of the orbit
The relative position of the lower jaw articulation has been scored in different ways by several authors
(e.g. (20): ch. 41 App. 3, (5): ch. 48, (3): ch. 16, (11): ch. 62, (63): ch. 45, (50): ch. 59, (10): ch. 66).
Compared to previous authors, we have here defined more character states aiming to improve and
facilitate the scoring of this character.
70. Quadratojugal
(0) present
(1) absent
From Olsen and McCune ((15): ch. 22).
71. Quadratojugal fused to quadrate
(0) absent
(1) present
72. Quadratojugal
(0) plate-like
(1) splint-like
From Gardiner et al. ((38): ch. 24 App. 1), Hurley et al. ((43): ch. 43), and López-Arbarello and
Wencker ((40): ch. 15).
73. Ventral articular facet of quadratojugal portion of the teleost quadrate
(0) absent (Fig. 5)
(1) present (Fig. 6)
López-Arbarello and Sferco (53) noticed the presence of a well-defined concave articular facet in the
posteroventral margin of the quadrate, adjacent to the quadrate condyle, in several Jurassic teleosts.
They discuss the possible function of this articular facet, which articulates with the postarticular
process of the lower jaw probably preventing an extreme downward rotation of the lower jaw. They
also argue that this facet is formed within the area of the quadrate that might be homologous with the
quadratojugal (3, 45, 46, 54, 57, 61, 64-69), and discuss the probably analogue saddle-like articular
facet in the anteroventral margin of the quadratojugal of the lepisosteiform †Scheenstia zappi. We
have now traced the distribution of the ventral articular facet of the quadrate, which is present in most
of the examined Jurassic teleosts.
74. Shape of the dorsal margin of the quadrate
(0) convex
(1) straight
(2) concave
(3) sinuous or sigmoid
(4) notched
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 44). State 4 is autapomorphic for Brycon meeki in our data matrix.
Hyoid arch
75. Urohyal
(0) absent
(1) present
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 51).
76. Endoskeletal basihyal
(0) absent
(1) present
From Patterson ((61): ch. 42).
77. Basihyal tooth plates
(0) absent
(1) present
78. Organization of basihyal tooth plates
(0) simple
(1) consisting of a mosaic of entoglossals forming a "tongue bone"
Characters 77 and 78 are modified from Cavin ((70): ch. 32) and Grande ((5): ch. 77) to avoid
“pseudo-ordering” according to Brazeau (2).
79. Number of hypohyal ossifications
(0) one pair
(1) two pairs, dorsal and ventral hypohyals
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 49).
80. Trajectory of the hyoidean artery piercing the hypohyals
(0) absent
(1) present
Modified from Arratia ((21): ch. 61).
81. Shape of anterior ceratohyal
(0) deep, subrectangular (e.g. †Ticinolepis longaeva (71): fig. 10)
(1) elongate hourglass shape (e.g. Lepisosteus osseus (5): fig. 67)
(2) narrow anteriorly, more expansive and laterally compressed posteriorly (e.g. Amia calva
(9): fig. 55)
(3) deeply hourglass shape without Beryciform foramen (e.g. †Neosemionotus puntanus (72):
fig. 5)
(4) deeply hourglass shape with Beryciform foramen (e.g. †Luisiella feruglioi (73): fig. 7C)
Modified from Gardiner et al. ((38): ch. 30 App. 1) adapting to the morphological variation
represented in our data matrix. Stewart ((34): ch. 13), Alvarado-Ortega ((33): ch. 32), Cavin et al.
((36): ch. 40), Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 48) only include the presence of a Beryciform foramen and, thus,
using those codings would produce an unspecified absence (1).
82. Symplectic bone
(0) absent
(1) present
From Gardiner and Schaeffer (12: ch. 23).
83. Symplectic relationship to lower jaw
(0) is not directly involved in the jaw joint
(1) participates directly in the jaw joint
From Olsen and McCune ((15): ch. 19). According to our observations (Fig. 5), the symplectic does
not reach the lower jaw in †Aspidorhynchus acutirostris.
84. Relation between symplectic and quadrate
(0) symplectic posteroventral to quadrate, the two bones are separate
(1) symplectic articulates with the inner, medial surface of quadrate
(2) symplectic attached into a groove formed by the posteroventral border of the quadrate
(3) symplectic posterodorsal and well separate from quadrate
(4) symplectic attached between the quadrate and quadratojugal
Modified from Hurley et al. ((43): ch. 45).
85. Shape of symplectic
(0) slightly curved tube or splint
(1) bar-like shaped
(2) hatchet shaped
Modified from Grande ((5): ch. 68).
86. Preopercular process of hyomandibula (Fig. 10)
(0) absent
(1) present
From Arratia ((20): ch. 36 App. 3).
87. Opercular process of hyomandibula notably elongated
(0) absent
(1) present
From Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 24). The observed variation embraced in our absence character state
is so gradual and noticeably different from the condition in the present state, that this is not a case of
unspecified absence (1).
88. Hyomandibular articulation with the neurocranium
(0) by means of one articular surface
(1) by means of two distinct articular surfaces
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 42).
89. Shape of hyomandibula
(0) rod like
(1) hourglass shaped, with a constriction between the shaft and the articular head
(2) shaft approximately as broad as hyomandibular head
(3) shaft notably narrower than hyomandibular head
Dermal braincase
90. Number of extrascapular bones
(0) one pair
(1) two pairs
(2) more than four extrascapulars
From López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 20). Brito ((6): ch. 20) distinguish only two states corresponding to
our states (0), and (1) plus (2) together. The distinction between our states (1) and (2) is based on our
own observations. Besides the numerous taxa with a single pair of extrascapular bones, several other
taxa present only two pairs of extrascapulars and this number is stable even between closely related
species. Differently, taxa with more than two pairs of extrascapulars usually present intraspecific
variation in the total number of extrascapulars, including uneven counts. Similarly, Grande and Bemis
((9): ch. 49) includes only two states for this character: presence of only one vs. three pairs.
91. Shape of the extrascapular bone/s
(0) plate like, quadrangular to triangular
(1) tubular
(2) semicircular, expanded caudolaterally
(3) expanded rostrally
Modified from Li and Wilson ((74): ch. 27) and Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 8). State 3 is autapomorfic for
Hiodon alosoides in our data matrix.
92. Posterior extension of parietals median to the single pair of laterally placed extrascapular bones
(0) absent
(1) present
From López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 21).
93. Dermopterotic (or pterotic) exposed surface extending anterior to parietal
(0) by more than 50% of its total length
(1) by more than 40% but less than 50% of its total length
(2) by more than 30% but less than 40% of its total length
(3) by less than 30% of its total length
(4) not extending anterior to parietal
Modified from Gardiner et al. ((38): ch. 15 App. 2). The ranges of the different character states
proposed here are based on measurements taken on 32 taxa (Fig. S2-2).
Figure S2-2: Relative length of the anterior portion of the exposed surface of the dermopterotic in 32
studied taxa, expressed as ratios: length of the exposed surface of the dermopterotic anterior to parietal
/ total length of the exposed surface of the dermopterotic.
94. Dermopterotic (or pterotic) exposed surface extending posterior to parietal
(0) absent
(1) present
95. Shape of exposed surface of dermopterotic
(0) roughly rectangular (e.g. †Ticinolepis longaeva (71): figs. 7, 9-10, 12)
(1) resembling an inverted L (e.g. †Luisiella feruglioi (73): fig. 4)
(2) roughly triangular (e.g. †Caturus furcatus (9): fig. 401A)
Modified from Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 35).
96. Dermopterotic descending lamina
(0) absent
(1) present
97. Dermopterotic posterior projection(s)
(0) absent
(1) present and simple
(2) present, one or more, and notably large
Modified from Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 27), which is equivalent to our state (2).
98. Condition of the skull roof
(0) medioparietal
(1) lateroparietal
From Cavin ((35): ch. 1).
99. Parietal width to length ratio
(0) not exceeding 0.90
(1) well exceeding 0.90
From Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 18). We differ from Grande and Bemis (9) in the scoring of this
character for †Dorsetichthys bechei.
100. Relative length of parietals respect to the length of the frontals
(0) less than one half but more than one third the length of frontals
(1) about half the length of frontals
(2) less than one third the length of frontals
(3) more than half the length of frontals
From López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 22). Other authors use different character states (e.g. Cavin et al. ((49):
ch. 20).
101. Length to width ratio of frontals in adult sized individuals
(0) lower than three
(1) equal or larger than three
From López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 23). Other authors (e.g. (9): ch. 34, (70): ch. 12, (75): ch. 34, (14): ch.
29, (50): ch. 34) use different ranges for their character states.
102. General shape of frontal
(0) subrectangular not significantly narrower anteriorly than posteriorly
(1) tapering gradually
(2) strongly constricted at the orbit; minimal interorbital width less than half of maximal
width in the temporal region
(3) with tubular antorbital portion
This character merges Arratia ((21): ch. 188) and López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 24) with López-Arbarello
((3): ch. 25) because they represent different versions of the same feature, i.e. the general shape of the
frontal, and are thus not mutually independent. Additionally, we added the character state 2, which is
not represented in the data matrix of López-Arbarello (3).
103. Postorbital portion of frontal
(0) not significantly large (e.g. †Semionotus bergeri (76): figs. 4-5)
(1) large, more than 1/3 of total length of frontal (e.g. †Ticinolepis longaeva (71): figs. 9-10)
104. Preorbital portion of frontal
(0) not significantly large (e.g. †Ticinolepis longaeva (71): figs. 9-10)
(1) large, more than 1/3 of total length of frontal (e.g. †Occitanichthys canjuerensis (40): fig.
5)
Characters 103 and 104 are proposed here to represent the variation observed in the position or
extension of the frontal relative to the orbit. Typically in amiids, but also in †Caturus furcatus,
†Watsonulus eugnathoides among halecomorphs, the ginglymodian †Ticinolepis longeva, the teleost
†Rhacolepis buccalis and the outgroup taxa †Plesiofuro mingshuica, †Australosomus kochi, and
†Pteronisculus stensioi, the frontal has a relatively large postorbital portion (103[1]). Contrary, in the
most common condition among ginglymodians, the frontal extends anterior to the orbit (character
(104[1]). This condition is also found among halecomorphs in †ophiopsids and †Quetzalichthys
perrillae.
105. Interfrontal fontanelle in adults
(0) absent
(1) present
From Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 37).
106. Shape of nasal bones
(0) broad, approximately rectangular to oval or trapezoidal (e.g. †Ticinolepis longaeva (71):
figs. 9-10)
(1) broad kidney shaped (e.g. †Lepidotes elvensis (40): fig. 12C)
(2) approximately tubular (e.g. Hiodon alosoides (31): figs. 28-29)
(3) approximately tear-shape, broadest anteriorly, narrowing posteriorly (e.g. †Solnhofenamia
elongate (9): figs. 330-333)
(4) small, approximately kidney shaped (e.g. Atractosteus spatula (5): figs. 216-217)
(5) long and narrow, anterior end incurved laterally (e.g, †Sangiorgioichthys sui (77): fig. 4)
(6) inverted Y-shaped (e.g. †Quetzalichthys perrilliatae (78): figs. 4-5)
The shape of the nasal bones is highly variable among neopterygians and several authors have code a
character with different states to encompass the variation observed in their corresponding sample of
taxa (e.g. (74): ch. 12, (79): ch. 2, (80): ch. 7, (3): ch. 28, (10): ch. 3). Similarly, the character states
proposed herein represent the numerous morphotypes found among the taxa included in our data
matrix.
107. Relationship between left and right nasal bones
(0) sutured to each other (e.g. †Ticinolepis longaeva (71): figs. 9-10)
(1) close to each other (e.g. †Lepidotes elvensis (40): fig. 12C)
(2) widely separated (e.g. Hiodon alosoides (31): figs. 28-29)
Modified from Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 4).
108. Position of nasals relative to frontals
(0) nasals placed anterior to frontals (e.g. †Ticinolepis longaeva (71): figs. 9-10)
(1) nasals placed lateral to frontals (e.g. †Quetzalichthys perrilliatae (78): figs. 4-5)
Independently of the extension of the preorbital portion of the frontal bones, the nasals of most
neopterygian taxa are placed anterior to the frontals either directly articulated with them or loosely
attached in the soft tissue. In many teleosts, the nasals are placed lateral to the frontals, which is the
most common condition among Jurassic teleosts.
Arratia ((26): ch. 24) use a character coding “nasals bones: joined in midline [0]; separate from
each other by parietal bones [= frontals] [1]”. This is a case of “compound character” (2), in which
two mutually independent features are taken together: the relationship between the two nasals (coded
in our character 107) and the relative position of the nasals respect to the frontals (our character 108).
To exemplify, the nasals in Hiodon alosoides are well separated from each other, but they are placed
anterior and not lateral to the frontals.
The nasals in the halecomorphs †Oshunia brevis and †Quetzalichthys perrilliatae are also lateral to
the frontals.
109. Posterior nostril relationship to nasal bone
(0) excavating the lateral margin of the nasals
(1) completely included in the posterior portion of the nasals
(2) cutting the posterolateral border of the nasals
(3) not indicated by the nasals
Modified from Arratia ((11): ch. 21). In many ginglymodians and halecomorphs the anterior end of the
nasal bones is laterally incurved or the lateral border of the bone is deeply concave, in both cases
probably surrounding the posterior nare, but the bone itself is not excavated or perforated as in
character states 0 to 2. Our state 1 is equivalent to the a/p character Arratia ((11): ch. 21).
110. Nasal bones participate in the orbital margin
(0) present
(1) absent
From Xu and Wu ((48): ch. 22).
Cheek and circumborbital bones
111. Ossified sclerotic ring
(0) present
(1) absent
From Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 14). Grande and Bemis (9) score the presence of a sclerotic ring in
†Ionoscopus cyprinoides, but we haven’t found evidence for these ossifications in any specimen.
According to Hilton ((80)) there are sclerotic bones in Hiodon alosoides, which is thus here scored
with 111(0), differing from Arratia ((11): ch. 50, (26): ch. 56), who score the absence of sclerotic
bones for this genus.
112. Quadrate laterally covered by infraorbital bones
(0) absent
(1) present
From López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 40) and it is important to read the corresponding discussion there to
avoid double scoring if using Cavin ((70): ch. 19).
113. Supraorbital bones
(0) present
(1) absent
From Gardiner and Schaeffer ((12): ch. 14).
114. Circumborbital ring
(0) most anterior supraorbital does not contact infraorbitals
(1) most anterior supraorbital contacts infraorbital series
From Hurley et al. ((43): ch. 29).
115. Number of supraorbital bones
(0) more than four
(1) three or four
(2) two
(3) one
The number of supraorbital bones has been used as a character, with different character states, by
several authors (e.g. (12): ch. 14, (9): ch. 12). Other authors (e.g. (11): ch. 49, (10): ch. 33, (13): ch.
17) code the absence of supraorbitals together with the different amounts of supraorbitals in a single
multistate character, which would lead to “pseudo-ordering” (2).
116. Arrangement of supraorbital bones
(0) in one row
(1) in two rows
117. Size of supraorbital bones relative to orbit
(0) small
(1) large
(2) all supraorbitals small except the first, most anterior supraorbital, which is large, expanded
anteriorly
From López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 31).
118. Shape of most anterior supraorbital bone
(0) subrectangular to triangular, if the ring is closed, contacting only the antorbital or one
infraorbital bone
(1) trapezoidal, longest ventrally, contacting more than one infraorbital bone
(2) pentagonal
(3) expanded anteroventrally, making the anterodorsal corner of the orbit
Modified from López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 32), which only considers our state 1, i.e. the
presence/absence of a large supraorbital with expanded anteroventral portion. In our data matrix, states
2 and 3 are autapomorphies of †Tlayuamichin itzli and †Araripelepidotes temnurus, respectively.
119. Size and shape of dermosphenotic
(0) extended and tapering rostrally (e.g. Hiodon alosoides (31): fig. 36)
(1) extended and tapering caudally, ending at the level of the anterior margin of the
dermopterotic (or pterotic) (e.g. Amia calva (9): fig. 18-19)
(2) very large, extended and tapering caudally, reaching close to the level of the preopercular
canal (e.g. †Aspidorhynchus acutirostris Brito (6): fig. 31)
(3) small, not distinctly extended rostrally or caudally (e.g. †Ticinolepis longaeva (71): fig. 6)
(4) large, keystone shaped (e.g. Lepisosteus osseus (5): figs. 27-28)
The size and shape of the dermosphenotic have been expressed in different ways and included as a
character by several authors (e.g. (10): ch. 35, (13): ch. 12). An anteriorly expanded dermosphenotic
(state 0) is found in the outgroup taxa †Pteronisculus and †Boreosomus, and in several teleosts
(†Pachycormus, †Parapholidophorus, †Pholidorhynchodon, †Diplomystus, and the living Elops,
Brycon and Hiodon). The opposite, a posteriorly extended dermosphenotic (state 1) is only found
among amiiforms (Amia, †Cyclurus and †Pachyamia). In Salmo, †Notelops, †Rhacolepis and
†Aspidorhynchus, the dermosphenotic is also expanded posteriorly, but it is distinctly very large in
these taxa (state 2). Also relatively very large is the keystone shaped dermosphenotic (state 4) of most
lepisosteiforms. However, in the most common condition amongst the studied neopterygians, the
dermosphenotic is a relatively small, approximately rectangular bone (state 3).
120. Position of dermosphenotic relative to orbital margin
(0) dermosphenotic participates in orbital margin
(1) dermosphenotic is excluded from orbital margin
From Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 38).
121. Dermosphenotic/sphenotic association
(0) closely associated with each other (i.e. contacting or fused to each other)
(1) not in contact with each other
From Grande ((5): ch. 22).
122. Dermosphenotic incorporated into skull roof in adult sized individuals
(0) absent, hinged to the side of skull roof
(1) present, sutured into skull roof, forming part of it
From Olsen and McCune ((15): ch. 23).
123. Shape of the postinfraorbital bones (jugal not included)
(0) deeper than long, sometimes almost tubular (e.g. †Ticinolepis longaeva (71): fig. 6)
(1) approximately quadrangular (e.g. †Scheenstia zappi López-Arbarello (53): fig. 5)
(2) longer than deep, expanded posteriorly, not longer than the orbital diameter (e.g.
Lepisosteus osseus (5): figs. 27-28)
(3) very large, longer than the orbit (e.g. Amia calva (9): figs. 18-19)
(4) approximately triangular, tapering dorsally (e.g. †Caturus furcatus (9): fig. 401)
(5) subrectangular and elongated in posterodorsal to anteroventral direction (e.g.
†Macrepistius arenatus (81): fig. 2)
Modified from López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 37).
124. Number of postorbital bones (infraorbital bones forming the posterior rim of the orbit (jugal
not included)
(0) one
(1) two
(2) three
(3) none
We keep the absence state within this character (state 3 in this case), because it is not possible to
establish one-to-one relationships of homology between individual infraorbital bones (see discussion
in López-Arbarello (3)). Therefore, this is not a case of “pseudo-ordering” (2), but just different
patterns of infraorbital bones.
125. The largest circumborbital bone is
(0) the jugal (infraorbital placed at the posteroventral corner of the orbit), and it is not much
larger than other infraorbital bones (e.g. †Luisiella feruglioi (73): fig. 4)
(1) the jugal (infraorbital placed at the posteroventral corner of the orbit), and it is notably
larger than other infraorbitals (e.g, †Sangiorgioichthys sui (77): fig. 4)
(2) a postorbital occupying the posteroventral and posterior rim of the orbit (in some cases
this area is occupied by one or more bones of similar size) (e.g. Amia calva (9): fig. 18)
(3) the dermosphenotic or a supraorbital (all these bones being of similar size) (e.g.
Lepisosteus osseus (5): figs. 27-28)
(4) one of the supraorbitals (the dermosphenotic is notably smaller than the supraorbitals)
(e.g. †Neosemionotus puntanus (72): fig. 5)
(5) the infraorbital placed at the centre of the ventral margin of the orbit (e.g. †Ticinolepis
longaeva (71): fig. 6)
(6) the lacrimal or infraorbital placed at the anteroventral corner of the orbit (e.g. †Teoichthys
brevipina (82): fig. 2)
(7) one of the anterior infraorbitals (e.g. †Macrosemimimus fegerti (62): figs. 5-6)
(8) the jugal or the lacrimal, both with similar size (e.g. †Archeosemionotus connectens (14):
fig. 6)
The high variation in the relative size of the infraorbital bones in neopterygians led us to coding eight
different character states. These numerous character states cannot be separated as independent
characters because it is not possible to establish one-to-one relationships of homology between most
of the infraorbital bones (see discussion in López-Arbarello (3)).
126. Contact between preopercle and jugal or lower postinfraorbital
(0) absent
(1) present
Modified from López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 36).
127. General shape of the subinfraorbital bone(s) (Infraorbital bones forming the ventral border of
the orbit between the lacrimal and the jugal)
(0) subrectangular to triangular, about 1,5 to 2,5 times deeper than long (e.g. †Semionotus
bergeri (76): figs. 4-5)
(1) subtriangular, longer ventrally, more than 3 times deeper than long (e.g. †Macrepistius
arenatus (81): fig. 2)
(2) quadrangular to longer than deep, notably smaller than the orbit (e.g. †Ticinolepis
longaeva (71): fig. 6)
(3) subrectangular, a quarter to half the size of the orbit (e.g. †Archeosemionotus connectens
(14): fig. 6)
(4) scroll-like (e.g. †Propterus elongatus Bartram (54): fig. 24)
Modified from Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 43) code the shape of the anterior subinfraorbital bone,
which corresponds to the most anterior bone forming the ventral rim of the orbit, when more than one
infraorbital is present between the lacrimal and the jugal. In most halecomorphs there is usually only
one infraorbital between these bones and, thus, theirs and ours character are equivalent, referring to
the same bone. However, the character states in Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 43) are not directly
comparable to our character states. Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 43) state 1 (subrectangular, deeper than
long) is equivalent to our state (0) and we added a the new state (1) to represent the condition in
†Macrepistius, which is unique of this taxon in our data matrix. On the other hand, our state (2)
encompasses their states 0 (short, subrectangular longer than deep), 2 (long, very thin, tube like), and 3
(posteriorly expansive, tapering anteriorly) because the general shape in the three cases is
approximately the same, with little variation (e.g. the tubular shape is usually present in very small
specimens, and the bones are short when there are more than one infraorbital in this series, which is a
different character).
128. Ventral surface of subinfraorbital bones intensely pitted
(0) absent
(1) present
Modified from Alvarado-Ortega and Espinosa-Arrubarrena ((78): ch. 18).
129. Lacrimal size relative to orbit
(0) significantly smaller than orbit (e.g. †Ticinolepis longaeva (71): fig. 6)
(1) about half to equal size of orbit (e.g. †Archeosemionotus connectens (14): fig. 6)
(2) about size of orbit or larger (e.g. †Macrepistius arenatus (81): fig. 2)
Modified from Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 58) by adding new states to represent all the variation
contained in our data set.
130. Anterior infraorbitals
(0) absent (e.g. †Luisiella feruglioi (73): fig. 4)
(1) present (e.g. †Macrosemimimus fegerti (62): figs. 4-6)
From Olsen and McCune ((15): ch. 1). The term ‘anterior infraorbitals’ (after Wenz (83)) refers to the
infraorbital bones placed anterior to the anterior border of the orbit and posterior to the antorbital,
which do not contribute to the orbital margin. Different names have been used for these bones in the
literature: preorbitals (84), lacrimals (39, 46), or anterior infraorbitals (83, 85), among which the latter
is preferred here because it highlights the homology of these bones with the other infraorbital bones
(serial homology; (3): pp. 10–12).
131. Number of anterior infraorbitals
(0) one
(1) two or more
(2) three or more
(3) four or more
(4) five or more
(5) six or more
(6) seven or more
From López-Arbarello and Wencker ((40): ch. 31), modified from Bermúdez-Rochas and Poyato-
Ariza ((86): ch. 92). The number of anterior infraorbital bones is intraspecifically and in some cases
even individually variable. Therefore, we score the minimal number of anterior infraorbitals.
Character state 6 is autapomorphic for †Tlayuamichin in our data matrix.
132. Shape of most anterior anterior-infraorbital
(0) not distinct than adjacent infraorbital (e.g. †Ticinolepis longaeva (71): fig. 6)
(1) rectangular dorsal portion, ventrally expanded and higher than adjacent infraorbital (e.g.
†Lepidotes (3): figs. 8, 20)
(2) narrowing dorsally, expanded ventrally, further ventral than the adjacent anterior
infraorbitals (e.g. †Macrosemimimus fegerti (62): fig. 6)
(3) approximately rectangular, deeper than adjacent anterior infraorbital (e.g. †Masillosteus
janeae (5): figs. 456-457)
Modified from López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 35).
133. Ventral border of infraorbital series
(0) follows a straight line or a gentle curve (e.g. †Occitanichthys canjuerensis (40): fig. 6)
(1) flexes abruptly dorsally at the anterior margin of the orbit (e.g. †Lepidotes (3): figs. 8, 20)
From López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 30). This character is only applicable for those taxa with anterior
infraorbitals.
134. A series of toothed infraorbitals bordering the snout
(0) absent ((3): figs. 7A-C)
(1) present ((3): figs. D)
From Wiley ((46): ch. 3).
135. Independent antorbital bone
(0) present
(1) absent
From Cavin ((35): ch. 23).
136. Shape of antorbital bone
(0) approximately triangular or drop-like, narrowing posterodorsally
(1) rectangular
(2) clavate
(3) sickle- to L-shape
(4) approximately triradiated, Y-shape
(5) tubular
(6) splint-like
Modified from the multistate characters in Gardiner et al. ((38): ch. 18 App. 1), Hurley et al. ((43): ch.
32), and Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 38), including different character states, which have been merged and
adapt to represent the morphotypes recognized in the taxa included in our analysis.
Arratia ((20): ch. 30 App. 3, (21): ch. 38, (23): ch. 34, (22): ch. 34, (27): ch. 33) uses a binary
character coding the presence/absence of a comma-shaped antorbital bone only, thus producing an
unspecified absence (1) including different morphologies, e.g. †Anaethalion, †Dorsetichthys, Elops,
†Thrissops, and †Varasichthys (here state 0), †Aspidorhynchus and Brycon (here state 4), Salmo and
†Diplomystus (here state 6), †Pachycormus, and Amia (here state 2).
Cavin et al. (35) questioned the presence of an antorbital bone in †Thrissops, but the bone is well
preserved in specimens of †Thrissops formosus (e.g. JME-ETT 74, 887, 972, 1350, 1805).
137. Tapering canal bearing anterior arm of antorbital bone
(0) absent
(1) present
Modified from Hurley et al. ((43: ch. 32) and Grande ((5): ch. 12).
138. Antorbital bone carrying a portion of the infraorbital sensory canal
(0) infraorbital canal extends into antorbital bone
(1) infraorbital canal ends blindly in the first infraorbital
From Arratia ((20): ch. 23 App. 3).
139. Antorbital bone participates in the anterior orbital margin
(0) absent
(1) present
From Xu et al. ((50): ch. 78).
140. Independent rostral bone
(0) absent, ethmoidal commissure in antorbitals (see †Boreosomus piveteaui (51): 69)
(1) present (e.g. Amia calva (9): fig. 10, Atractosteus spatula (5): figs. 216A, 217A)
(2) absent, ethmoidal commissure in a compound mesethmoid (Fig. 4D)
(3) absent, presence of a rostrodermethmoid (e.g. †Notelops brama (29): fig. 1)
(4) absent, no trace of ethmoidal commissure
Modified from Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 80).
141. Shape of rostral bone
(0) relatively small approximately rectangular to tube-like (e.g. †Ticinolepis longaeva (71):
figs. 8-9)
(1) relatively large and shield-like without lateral horns (e.g. †Dapedium pholidotum (4): figs.
7-8)
(2) shield-like with lateral horns (e.g. †Catervariolus hornemani (87): figs. 9, 13, 17)
(3) relatively large and roughly rounded or rectangular-shaped without lateral horns (e.g.
†Siemensichthys macrocephalus (18): fig. 145)
(4) roughly V-shaped, with lateral horns and caudal triangular process (e.g. Amia calva (9):
figs. 10-15)
Modified from Gardiner et al. ((38): ch. 19 App. 1) and Arratia ((26): ch. 7). We separated their state 0
(plate-like or short tube-like, without lateral horns) in our states (0) and (1), and we added state 2 and
3 to represent the shape of the rostral in several Triassic and Jurassic teleosts (11).
142. Independent post-rostral bone
(0) present
(1) absent
From Xu et al. ((13): ch. 52).
143. Suborbital bones
(0) present
(1) absent
From Gardiner and Schaeffer ((12): ch. 9).
144. Number of suborbital bones
(0) one
(1) two
(2) three
(3) four or more, usually numerous suborbitals
Modified from López-Arbarello and Wencker ((40): ch. 39).
145. Distribution of suborbital bones
(0) do not outspread anteriorly below the orbit
(1) outspread anteriorly below the orbit
Modified from López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 42), which is a compound character (2) and, thus, we now
coded the different independent traits in the separate characters 145 and 146.
146. Arrangement of suborbital bones
(0) one row
(1) two rows
(2) mosaic of numerous suborbitals
Modified from López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 42).
147. Independent of the total number, there is a large suborbital covering almost the whole area
between the infraorbital bones and the preopercle
(0) absent
(1) present
From López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 43).
148. Independent of the total number, there is a suborbital bone between the dermopterotic and
preopercle
(0) absent
(1) present (see López-Arbarello and Alvarado-Ortega (88): fig. 7)
149. Relative size of the most anterior and most dorsal suborbitals
(0) of similar size than the other suborbitals
(1) notably larger than the other suborbitals (see (53): fig. 8)
From López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 44). The character is not applicable unless there is a series of at least
three suborbital bones.
150. Suborbitals covering the quadrate laterally
(0) present, suborbitals within a series or mosaic, no distinct shape
(1) present, one or two suborbitals forming a triangular plate
From López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 46). The character is not applicable unless there are suborbitals lateral
to the quadrate.
Jaws and dentition
151. Relative position of premaxillary bones
(0) anteriorly placed contacting at the midline
(1) anterolaterally to laterally placed separated by ethmoidal and/or rostral ossifications
Modified from Arratia ((25): ch. 9).
152. Premaxillary nasal processes (= lateral dermethmoids)
(0) small lining the nasal pits, without or only partially surrounding the olfactory foramen
(Fig. 4A)
(1) large completely enclosing the olfactory fenestra (Fig. 4B)
Modified from Gardiner et al. ((38): ch. 20 App. 1). Since we are following the hypothesis of primary
homology between the nasal process of the premaxilla of halecomorphs and ginglymodians and the
lateral dermethmoids of teleosts (see discussion of character 48), this character is also scored for those
teleosts in which the lateral dermethmoids are lining the nasal pits (†Catervariolus, †Dorsetichthys,
†Ichthyokentema, †Pachycormus, †Pholidorhynchodon, and †Siemensichthys). In all these teleosts the
lateral dermethmoids do not enclose the olfactory fenestra (state 0). The condition in other teleosts is
not comparable because the participation of the lateral dermethmoids in the nasal pit is very limited or
null (18, 69, 80).
153. Premaxillary nasal process relationship to frontal
(0) does not suture to the frontal
(1) sutures to the ventral surface of the frontal
(2) sutures to the frontal and forms an external dermal component of the skull roof
Modified from Grande (5) characters 6 and 7, which are merged in this multistate character because
they represent different conditions of the same trait.
154. Maxilla
(0) present and independent
(1) fused to toothed infraorbital bones
Modified from Xu and Ma ((89): ch. 32).
155. Maxilla relationship to preopercle
(0) attached to preopercle
(1) free from preopercle
From Gardiner and Schaeffer ((12): ch. 13).
156. Length of maxilla relative to coronoid process
(0) very long, extends beyond the coronoid process
(1) extends backwards partially covering the coronoid process laterally
(2) very short, does not reach the coronoid process
Modified from López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 50).
157. Posterior extent of maxilla relative to orbit
(0) beyond posterior orbital margin
(1) up to posterior orbital margin
(2) up to centre of the orbit
(3) up to anterior orbital margin
(4) in front of the orbit
Modified from Gardiner et al. ((38): ch. 26 App. 2).
158. Shape of maxilla
(0) elongate, broad posteriorly, stretches well behind the orbit
(1) elongate, shallow
(2) maxilla extremely slender
(3) deep, depth > 0,5 of its length
This character merges Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 53), Hurley et al. ((43): ch. 39), and López-
Arbarello ((3): ch. 51).
159. Ventral margin of maxilla
(0) straight or almost straight
(1) slightly convex
(2) slightly concave
(3) bends downwards posteriorly
Modified from Arratia and Tischlinger ((27): ch. 185).
160. Shape of posterodorsal corner of maxilla
(0) rounded to straight angle (e.g. †Cyclurus (9): figs. 243)
(1) acute angle (e.g. †Vidalamia (9): figs. 243)
Several authors code the shape of the posterior border of the maxilla (e.g. (9): ch. 62). However, the
shape of the posterior border of the maxilla greatly depends on the shape of its posterodorsal corner
(this character) and the presence of a postmaxillary process (next character). and we think that these
two characters are more useful to represent the variation in the shape of the posterior end of the
maxilla.
161. Postmaxillary process
(0) absent
(1) present and small
(2) present and notably large, posterior border of maxilla deeply excavated
Modified from Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 30).
162. Shape of dorsal margin of maxilla
(0) straight or concave infraorbital and convex postorbital portions
(1) generally straight or convex
(2) gently concave allocating supramaxilla
(3) with a distinct supramaxillary notch
163. Supramaxilla
(0) absent
(1) present, single bone
(2) present, two bones
From Brito ((6): ch. 19).
164. Relative length of single supramaxilla
(0) long, about half the length of the maxillary blade (without articular process) or larger
(1) short, about a quarter of the length of the maxilla
165. Relative position of supramaxilla(ae)
(0) placed dorsal to the dorsal margin of maxilla
(1) placed posterodorsal to the maxilla
From Arratia ((22): ch. 42).

From Gardiner and Schaeffer ((12): ch. 17).
169. Coronoid process
(0) made up by the dentary and surangular
(1) made up by the dentary only
(2) made up by the surangular only
(3) made up by the surangular and angular
(4) made up by the dentary and angular
Modified from Gardiner et al. ((90): ch. 28) and Arratia ((11): ch. 69).
170. Surangular
(0) absent
(1) present
From Patterson ((61): ch. 33). Nybelin ((91)) describes a single angulo-supra-angular bone, but Arratia
((21): p. 292) indicates an independent surangular in †Dorsetichthys bechei.
171. Independent articular bone
(0) single meckelian bone
(1) a single element
(2) two separate elements not in contact with each other
(3) absent
Modified from Patterson ((61): ch. 48) and Gardiner et al. ((38): ch. 17 App. 2). Arratia (11) scored an
articular fused with the angular and retroarticular in †Dorsetichthys bechei, but Nybelin (91) describes
an independent articular bone.
172. Postarticular process of lower jaw
(0) poorly developed or absent
(1) well developed, extending posterior to the articular facet for quadrate
From Arratia ((20): ch. 44 App. 3).

From Patterson ((61): ch. 26).
174. Retroarticular
(0) absent
(1) present and separate
(2) present and fused to angular only
(3) present and fused to articular only
(4) present and fused to angular and articular
Modified from Diogo et al. ((92): ch. 247) and Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 68).
175. Retroarticular and quadrato-mandibular joint
(0) retroarticular excluded from the joint facet for quadrate
(1) retroarticular included in the joint facet for quadrate
From Patterson ((61): ch. 50).
176. Coronoid bone(s) in lower jaw
(0) present
(1) absent
From Patterson ((61): ch. 13). Previous authors score the absence of coronoid bones in the lower jaw
of †Dorsetichthys bechei, but this feature has not been described so far. Grande (5) refers to Patterson
((61): pp. 626 and 629) for this feature in the taxon . However, regarding this character, Patterson
((61): character 13 on page 629) indicates the specimens number NHMUK PV P 44973–5 and P 3592,
which are identified as †Ichthyokentema purbeckensis and †Pholidophorus higginsi, respectively.
177. Plicidentine structure in teeth

larger fangs

(1) pointed pencil like
(2) high, bluntly pencil like
(3) molariform, broaader than high
(4) conical with labiolingually compressed, sharply carinate (keeled) caps
Modified from Bermúdez-Rochas and Poyato-Ariza ((86): ch. 55).
185. Morphology of teeth on anterior coronoids
(0) conical
(1) pointed pencil like
(2) high, blunt, flattened or broadly rounded
(3) molariform, broader than high
Modified from Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 16), which is a compound character encompassing the
morphology of the teeth on the anterior coronoids and vomer in a single character. We think there is
not necessarily a biological dependence in the morphology of the teeth in these different bones, which
are here considered in our independent characters 185 and 186.
186. Morphology of vomerine teeth
(0) conical
(1) pointed pencil like
(2) blunt, flattened or broadly rounded
(3) molariform
(4) heterogeneous sharply pointed fangs
Opercular bones, branchiostegals and gular
187. Shape of preopercle
(0) Long, angularly bent, with almost horizontal anterodorsal and vertical posteroventral
portions (e.g. †Pteronisculus Nielsen (51): figs. 27, 30)
(1) plate-like, broad dorsally, narrowing ventrally (e.g. †Plesiofuro Xu et al. ((13): fig. 5)
(2) comma-shape (e.g. †Ticinolepis longaeva (71): figs. 7, 9-10, 12)
(3) roughly L-shape with (e.g. †Luisiella feruglioi (73): fig. 4)
Several authors have considered one or other of our states as independent characters (e.g. (6): ch. 21,
(9): ch. 36, (43): ch. 41, (3): ch. 60, (75): ch. 20, (11): ch. 90).
188. Median anterior process of preopercle
(0) absent
(1) present
In †Boreosomus ((51): fig. 69) and †Australosomus ((93): fig. 25) and several non-neopterygian taxa,
the preopercle has a distinct acute process protruding in anterior direction from the anterior border of
the bone.
189. Anterior/anteroventral end of preopercle
(0) broadly tapered (e.g. †Ticinolepis longaeva (71): figs. 9-10, 12)
(1) finely tapered (e.g. †Occitanichthys canjuerensis (40): fig. 5-6)
190. Relative length of preopercular arms
(0) vertical arm is longer than horizontal arm (e.g. †Luisiella feruglioi (73): fig. 4)
(1) horizontal arm is longer than vertical arm (e.g. Lepisosteus osseus (5): figs. 60–61)
191. Posteroventral angle of an L-shape preopercle
(0) not distinctly expanded (e.g. †Luisiella feruglioi (73): fig. 4)
(1) fan shape expanded (e.g. †Tharsis dubius (94): table 12, fig. 3)
192. Anteromedial wing of preopercle
(0) absent
(1) present
193. Anterior notch of preopercle
(0) absent
(1) present
Modified from Arratia ((11): ch. 88). The preopercle of some Triassic teleosts presents a notch directly
at the anterior exit of the preopercular canal, directly at the edge between the anteromedial and lateral
wings of the bone. Therefore, the character is not applicable for those taxa with a preopercle without
anteromedial wing.
194. Exposure of dorsal limb of preopercle
(0) infraorbital or suborbital bones do not overlap, but only the anterior rim of preopercle
(1) suborbital bones completely overlap the dorsal limb of preopercle
From Grande ((5): ch. 73).
195. Preopercle to dermopterotic relationship
(0) preopercle reaches at least close to dermopterotic
(1) preopercle and dermopterotic are well separated by a space without bone
196. Posterior border of the preopercle notched ventrally
(0) absent
(1) present
From López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 62).
197. Suprapreopercle
(0) absent
(1) present
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 53).
198. Shape of the opercle width/length
(0) deeper than long
(1) approximately as deep as long
(2) tapering anteroventrally
(3) longer than deep
This character merges characters from several authors. Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 36) use a character
equivalent to the presence/absence of our state (3). López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 63) state 1 is equivalent
to our states 1 and 3 together. Our state (2) is equivalent to Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 57).
199. Opercle ornamentation in adult-sized individuals
(0) densely arranged low tubercles and/or ridges
(1) well-defined tubercles
(2) pattern of ridges radiating from the anterodorsal corner
(3) denticles
(4) ornamentation weak or absent
Modified from Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 33), which includes the a/p of our state (2) only. These
authors score the pattern of radiating ridges for Vidalamiini only, but we find this pattern in all amiids.
200. Ascending process of subopercle
(0) absent
(1) present
From López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 64).
201. Base of ascending process of the subopercle
(0) broad, more than 30% of the maximal length of the bone
(1) narrow, between 10 and 30% of the maximal length of the bone
(2) tiny, less than 10% of the maximal length of the bone
Modified from López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 65).
202. Height ascending process of the subopercle
(0) low, 20% of the maximal length of the bone
(1) medium, 20-40% of the maximal length of the bone
(2) high, approximately 50-60% of the maximal length of the bone
(3) very high, approximately 70% or more the maximal length of the bone
Modified from López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 66). It is only possible to score characters 201 and 202 if a
subopercle is at least partially disarticulated and the whole ascending process is exposed. Otherwise a
variably large portion of the process is overlapped and thus hidden by the opercle.
203. Subopercle maximal depth (excluding ascending process)
(0) more than half the depth of the opercle
(1) less than half the depth of the opercle
(2) deeper than the opercle
From López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 67).
204. Interopercle
(0) absent
(1) present
From Gardiner and Schaeffer ((12): ch. 18).
205. Relationship between interopercle and the lower jaw
(0) anterior end of interopercle close to mandible
(1) interopercle remote from mandible
Modified from Olsen and McCune ((15): ch. 11).
206. Branchiopercle
(0) absent
(1) present
The branchiopercle is generally distinguished because of its size, which is notably larger than the
largest branchiostegal bone in most taxa. Additionally, the branchiopercle in Amia calva develops in a
fold continuous with the lower edge of the lower jaw (95) and it is not only attached to the hyoid arch
(anterior ceratohyal), but also to the lower jaw in adult specimens (9). Accordingly, the branchiopercle
is aligned with the main axis of the lower jaw.
207. Number of branchiostegal rays
(0) 20 or more
(1) 15 to 20
(2) 10 to 15
(3) 6 to 9
(4) 3 or 4
The number of branchiostegals is used as a character in previous cladistic analyses (e.g. (9): ch. 54,
(56): ch. 12, (5): ch. 74), but we here use different ranges for the character states.
208. Median gular
(0) absent
(1) present
From Olsen and McCune ((15): ch. 8).
Brito (6) scores absence of gulars for †Ichthyokentema, but †I. purbeckensis has a broad median
gular according to Griffith and Patterson ((96): p. 19, text-fig. 7). Coates ((56): ch. 11 state 1) scores
“lateral gulars equivalent to area of three branchiostegals or less, with posterior and lateral angles” for
†Watsonulus, but there is single median gular in †W. eugnathoides (97).
209. Gular maximal with to maximal length ratio
(0) higher than 0.5
(1) between 0.3 and 0.5
(2) lower than 0.3
Modified from Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 32).
Branchial arches
210. Basibranchials tooth plates
(0) absent
(1) present and paired
(2) present and median
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 86).
211. Number of hypobranchials
(0) three
(1) four
From Grande ((5): ch. 99).
212. Infrapharyngobranchials tooth plates
(0) absent
(1) present on infrapharyngobranchials 2 and 3 only
(2) present on infrapharyngobranchials 1 to 3
(3) present on infrapharyngobranchial 3 only
This character is the result of merging Sferco et al. ((10): chs. 87–89).
213. Epibranchials
(0) slender
(1) with uncinate processes
From Gardiner and Schaeffer ((12): ch. 15).
Sensory canals
214. Junction of supraorbital and temporal canals
(0) no direct connection between the temporal (otic) and supraorbital sensory canals
(1) direct connection between the temporal (otic) and supraorbital sensory canals
From Cavin ((35): ch. 7).
215. Position of junction of supraorbital and temporal canals
(0) exclusively within frontal bone
(1) exclusively within dermosphenotic bone
(2) exclusively within dermopterotic bone
Modified from Cavin et al. ((49): ch. 24).
216. Supraorbital sensory canal in parietal
(0) present
(1) absent
From Grande and Poyato-Ariza ((37): ch. 11).
217. Middle pit line
(0) leaving a groove or pore-line on the parietal and dermopterotic
(1) leaving a groove or pore-line on the parietal only
(2) in the dermopterotic only
(3) leaving no trace on the bones
Modified from Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 79).
218. Position of the supratemporal commissure
(0) pierces extrascapulars
(1) pierces extrascapulars and parietals
(2) pierces parietals only, or parietals and supraoccipital
(3) pierces dermopterotics
Modified from Arratia ((20): ch. 26 App. 3). In our data matrix, states 2 and 3 are autapomorphic for
Brycon and †Pachycormus, respectively.
219. Orbital canal
(0) absent
(1) present
From López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 89).
220. Sensory canal in maxilla
(0) absent
(1) present
From Gardiner et al. ((38): ch. 24 App. 2).
221. Composition of preopercular sensory canal
(0) four or less, short simple tubules
(1) seven to 10, short simple or branched tubules
(2) 12 or more long, simple or branched tubules
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 83).
222. Posttemporal penetration by lateral line canal
(0) present
(1) absent
From Grande ((5): ch. 91).
223. Lateral line ossicles between caudal fin rays
(0) absent
(1) present
From Alvarado-Ortega and Espinosa-Arrubarrena ((78): ch. 13).
Vertebral column
224. Shape of vertebral centrum
(0) amphicoelous
(1) opistocoelous
From Wiley ((46): ch. 26). This character is only scored for those taxa with solidly ossified vertebra
because it is not applicable otherwise.
225. Arcocentrum
(0) absent
(1) present and thin, ring-like centra
(2) present and forming solidly ossified centra
226. Chordacentrum
(0) absent
(1) present
227. Autocentrum
(0) absent
(1) present
228. Diplospondylous centra in caudal region
(0) absent
(1) present
From Gardiner et al. ((38): ch. 11 App. 2). Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 1) is a compound character (2)
combining the diplospondily (this character) with the mode of ossification of the centra.
229. Surface of arcocentra
(0) sculptured with two pits
(1) sculptured with three or more pits
(2) smooth
The morphology of the lateral walls of the vertebral centra has been used as a character by several
authors (e.g. (9): ch. 4, (36): ch. 59, (11): ch. 98, (14): ch. 3, (10): ch. 92), but the surface of a centrum
might be formed by different tissues. Our character 229 is thus limited to the morphology of the
superficial arcocentra and the next character 230 refers to the superficial morphology of the
autocentra.
230. Surface of autocentra
(0) smooth
(1) sculptured
231. Large parapophyses
(0) absent
(1) present, not fused to the centra
(2) present, fused to the centra
Modified from Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 10) by adding our state (1). The taxa presenting state (1) in
our data matrix are scored with state 0 in the data matrix of Grande and Bemis (9).
The parapophyses are large in Hiodon alosoides, but they represent a different condition, which is
uniquely present in this taxon in our data matrix. The parapophyses in this species are spine like and
the ribs do not articulate with their distal tips, but they articulate dorsally, at the base of the
parapophyses. Therefore, the character is not applicable (-) for this taxon.
232. Morphology of pleural ribs
(0) distal ends pointed or with rounded points
(1) distal ends flatly truncated, even in large adults
From Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 31).
233. Relative shape of abdominal neural arches (lateral view)
(0) tapering distally
(1) distally expanded, hourglass-shaped
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 99).
234. Relationship between the abdominal neural arches and vertebral centra
(0) neuual arches attached to the centra but not fused to them
(1) all or most of the neural arches fused to the centra
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 94). In the holospondylous opistocoelous vertebrae of gars, the neural
arches are primarily continuous with the vertebral centra because the basidorsal arcualia directly
participates in the formation of the centrum.
235. Neural spines of abdominal vertebrae
(0) paired
(1) median
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 96).
236. Infrahaemals
(0) absent
(1) present
The infrahaemal bones are median spine-shaped bones articulating with the distal end of haemal
arches, but not fused to them (Goodrich (98)). The possible homology between infrahaemals and
neural spines is still unclear. The number of infrahaemals is intraspecifically variable.
237. Supraneural bones
(0) absent
(1) present
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 101).
238. Distribution of supraneural bones
(0) extend below dorsal fin
(1) the series of supraneurals ends anterior to dorsal fin
239. Shape of most anterior supraneurals
(0) simple rod-like bones
(1) with membranous expansions in the longitudinal plane
From Cavin et al. ((36): ch. 57). In the living gars, the first one or two supraneurals are reduced in size
and are comparatively more robust than the following supraneurals, but they are still rod-like and do
not form membranous expansions.
240. Epineural bones
(0) absent
(1) present
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 102).
241. Epipleural bones
(0) absent

(0) located in anterior caudal region
(1) located in abdominal and anterior caudal region
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 104).
243. Relationship between caudal neural arches and vertebral centra (excluding the last few preural
vertebrae)
(0) unfused
(1) fused
244. Shape of preural neural spines
(0) spine-like or rod-like
(1) broad with a median groove
(2) broad due to anterior and posterior membranous outgrowths
245. Shape of the preural haemal spines
(0) spine-like or rod-like
(1) broad with a median groove
(2) broad due to anterior and posterior membranous outgrowths
246. Haemal spines spatulate in the transverse plane
(0) absent
(1) present
From Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 65).
247. Relative length of neural spine on second preural vertebra (Pu2)
(0) as long as neural spine on third preural vertebra
(1) shorter than neural spine on third preural vertebra
From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 129).
248. Abrupt change in the orientation of preural caudal haemal spines
(0) absent

Modified from Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 67).
249. Abrupt change in the orientation of preural caudal neural spines

(1) variable, between 19 and 50
(2) stable at 19
(3) variable, up to 19
Modified from Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 163).
In Amia, there is a rather clear distinction between procurrent and principal rays on the dorsal
margin, but not in the ventral margin where the rays increase in length gradually. We take the first
branched ray as the first ventral principal ray.
283. Number of rays forming the dorsal margin of the caudal fin
(0) more than two (branched or not)
(1) two, at least the first unbranched
(2) one branched
(3) one unbranched
284. Number of principal caudal fin rays below lateral line
(0) more than eight
(1) eight
(2) seven
(3) six
Modified from López-Arbarello and Wencker ((40): ch. 76). This character merges characters 80 and
81 of López-Arbarello (3) because they are not independent, but represent different states of the same
feature.
285. Number of principal caudal fin rays associated to the preural skeleton
(0) more than nine
(1) seven or eight
(2) four to six
(3) one to three
Modified from Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 171).

From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 169).
289. Type of segmentation of marginal principal caudal rays

From Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 170).
290. Number of hypaxial procurrent (segmented) caudal fin rays

291. Epaxial basal fulcra (not segmented)
(0) present and scale-like
(1) present as procurrent rays
292. Hypaxial basal fulcra (not segmented)

(1) present, one row
(2) present, two or more rows
Modified from López-Arbarello ((3): ch. 82).
294. Urodermals
(0) presence of a complete body lobe
(1) present, few, isolated
(2) absent
From López-Arbarello et al. ((14): ch. 12). Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 13) use a similar character, but
do not distinguish character state 2, which represents a condition that they include in their character
state 0 (presence of urodermals).
295. Tendon-bones (i.e., 'urodermals'; Fig. 7) associated with dorsalmost principal caudal rays
(0) absent
(1) present
Modified from Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 174).
296. Dorsal scute(s) preceding caudal fin
(0) present, more than one
(1) present, single
(2) absent
Modified from Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 158). The homologies between these isolated dorsal and ventral
scutes preceding the caudal fin of teleosts and many halecomorphs are still unknown. These scutes
might be homologous with the dorsal caudal fulcra or the scutes of preceding the series of dorsal
caudal fulcra in several actinopterygians. Therefore, this and the next character (297) are inapplicable
for those taxa with a complete series of dorsal caudal fulcra.
297. Ventral scute(s) preceding caudal fin
(0) present, more than one
(1) present, single
(2) absent
298. Fringing fulcra on caudal fin
(0) present on both dorsal and ventral margins
(1) present on dorsal margin only
(2) absent
Grande and Bemis ((9): ch. 45) code the presence/absence of fringing fulcra in all median fins in a
single character. We distinguish the presence of fringing fulcra in the caudal fin (this character) from
their presence in the dorsal and anal fin in an independent character (315), which has a different
distribution.
299. Number of fringing fulcra on the first principal caudal fin ray
(0) numerous
(1) one to five
Modified from Sferco et al. ((10): ch. 162).

Appendix C
Dear Editors and reviewers:
First of all we want to acknowledge the valuable criticisms made by the two reviewers to our earlier
version of this manuscript. They have been very helpful to improve the quality of our paper!
We find only one main disagreement with the reviewers concerning epistemological approach to
systematics. As explained in our first answer to the first reviewer, we and most colleagues currently
working in phylogenetic systematics are convinced that, although characters should be carefully coded
in the framework of well justified hypotheses of primary homology, all observations are valuable and
the explanatory power of characters should not be judged a priori.
We hope that the revised version of our manuscript will be suitable for publication in the Royal
Society Open Science journal!
Best regards,
Adriana López-Arbarello and Emilia Sferco
Reviewer: 1
Page 2, l. 49: “more characters will hopefully be added in the future”. Another way to build a more
accurate phylogeny, rather than to add more characters, would be to improve the definitions of
characters and of the character states. In particular it seems clear to me that several characters in this
study, as well as in most studies including numerous characters, contain a lot of linked characters,
char. 14 and 15 as just an example (two or more characters are related because they depend of the
same developmental process). One possibility would be to decrease the number of characters used, but
to add more derived states (even if it is in contradiction with some recommendations, such as from
Brazeau, 2011). This is what the authors did for some characters, such as 23 or 39 for instance. I don’t
suggest to the authors to try this approach here (this is a new project per se!), but I stress the fact that
adding more and more characters will probably not help to better resolve phylogenies; it will just add
more unjustifiable weight on some anatomical features by cutting them into multiple small pieces. For
instance, char. 193 can be regarded as another state of char. 192.
Different topics are mixed in the comment made by the reviewer. On the one hand is the amount of
characters. The data matrix that we are presenting with this manuscript is so far the largest for
Mesozoic actinopterygians and includes only 339 characters. And we enhance ‘only’ 339 chracters.
Data matrices for other vertebrate groups are currently handling much larger number of morphological
characters (e.g., 437 characters for crocodyliforms in Leardi et al. (1); 560 characters for theropod
dinosaurs in Foth et al. (2); 2954 characters for birds in Livezey and Zusi (3); 4541 characters for
placental mammals in O’Leary et al. (4)). Most students of phylogenetic systematics, including us,
currently agree on the need of larger data sets of morphological characters, especially with the aim to
reach combined studies including as much morphological and genetic data, fossil and living taxa as
possible. The idea of limiting the data sets to “few significant” characters, the phylogenetic value of
which is predicted a priori, is nowadays obsolete (5-7). Still, as we expressed in the manuscript, future
research will certainly lead to improvements of our data matrix, including different definitions of
characters and character states and eventually merging characters, the biological dependence of which
escaped our current knowledge, but we also hope that new characters will enlarge the matrix too.
Another topic, independent from the total amount of characters, is that of the “linked characters” or
morphological integration, which has been largely discussed in the past ten years or more. Several
studies have shown that patterns of morphological correlation need to be considered carefully in all
morphological cladistic analyses, but these patterns first need to be found and tested thoroughly
because “the uncritical acceptance of an untested hypothesis of integration is likely to be as disruptive
to a cladistic analysis as when integration is ignored” ((8): 1). Finding and testing patterns of
morphological integration is a very complex and difficult task (see (9)), representing a major challenge
in morphological studies that can only be achieved based on large amount of detailed anatomical
information. Providing large amounts of well-defined morphological characters is by far not spurious,
but a contribution to that process and, until such modules are properly defined and tested, it is even
recommended to split composite characters in independent transformation series (e.g. (10)).
Page 4, l. 13-14: “Only the unambiguous synapomorphies were taken into account, discriminating
between unique and non-unique synapomorphies.” Maybe I don’t understand this. It seems to me that
unambiguous characters simply correspond to characters, which are not dependent of unknown
codings. They are not informative about unique synapomorphies (which are characters with a ci=1),
no?
The concepts of ambiguous/unambiguous synapomorphies are not exclusively related to missing data
(unknown scorings), but might also refer to the method of character optimization, even if there is no
missing data. Depending on the optimization, some character changes will be synapomorphic for a
certain clade under accelerated transformation (ACCTRAN; maximizing character state change as
close to the root as possible), but not if delayed transformation is assumed (DELTRAN; maximizing
character state change as close to the tips as possible), and vice versa (11, 12). These synapomorphies
depend on the optimization and are thus ambiguous. Other character changes are unambiguous
because they are synapomorphic under both delayed and accelerated transformation, i.e. both
optimization methods will set the character change at the same node. Agnarsson and Miller (13)
thoroughly discusses the pros and contras of ACCTRAN and DELTRAN optimizations and concluded
that there are no theoretical reasons to prefer one or other method and both methods should be applied
and considered to achieve the optimal understanding of character evolution. For this work, the first
cladistic analyses of the three main crow-neopterygian lineages taken together, the resulting
phylogenetic hypothesis is not robust enough and we do not want to hasten conclusions about
character evolution at this early stage of research. We therefore consider in our discussion only those
synapomorphies resulting from unambiguous changes as relevant in supporting groups.
We now added a paragraph clarifying this point in the methods section.
Page 16, l. 6: The position of Varasichthys within the leptolepids is not discussed here. Can the
authors discuss this point, in particular in the light of the pattern obtained by Arratia (2008), who
found connection of this genus with the “crossognathiforms” (including Notelops, located far away in
this new phylogeny)
We added a discussion of the relationships of Varasichthys in the secion 5.3 of the manuscript.
Chapter 5. The authors mention here the fact that the phylogenetic position of Thrissops and Caturus
differ from previous studies. They discussed below the case of Caturus, but not of Thrissops. Can they
provide some data why the position of Thrissops is unusual? Actually, Thrissops is the single
representative of the large group of ichthyodectiforms, whose phylogenetic relationships with outher
neopterygians have not been addressed for a long time. The position found here is actually not so
different from the one proposed by Patterson & Rosen (1977), i.e. a basal teleost close to L.
coryphaenoides and to Tharsis (which are grouped here in a clade).
We added a discussion of the relationships of Thrissops at the end of the section 5.3 of the manuscript.
Chapter 5.2: Why the authors did not discuss with more details the topologies obtained with the down-
weighting analyses, in particular the different position obtained for Dapedium?
We added a discussion of the relationships of Dapedium in the secion 5.3. of the manuscript.
Conclusion: Contrary to the rest of the text, this section seems to have been written quickly and
without much care. It introduces several important new ideas (with 3 new figures!), but the message is
not enough developed and there are too much imprecisions. Also, the first part of the conclusion deals
with the evolutionary history of the neopterygians, and the second part suggested that this history is
completely biased by the fossil record. It would have been better to start by explaining the biases, then
to discuss the main trends that can be nevertheless proposed. This conclusion should either be
included in the main text and extended, or it should be more developed and make the subject of
another short paper. Anyway, this point does not preclude to the general high quality of this paper and
I strongly support its publication pending the modifications suggested. noticeably
We specially acknowledge this critical comment about our earlier ‘conclusions’. We now reworked
this section completely. Parts of the earlier ‘conclusions’ are now extended as the new section 5.4 of
the manuscript and the new section 6 of conclusions includes a summary of the main results of our
work and some final reflexions relevant to the manuscript and future research on this field.
The first reviewer also made several comments directly on the manuscript. Many of them have been
incorporated and represent small changes in the manuscript, but a few others need special answer and
are thus listed here below (indicated with RC):
RC Page 2, line 5: Is it really 'macroevolutionary process' which is concerned? Processes are not really
concerned here but rather 'evolutionary history' and subsequently 'diversity dynamics'.
Of course it is about the macroevolutionary processes! We describe past diversity and reconstruct the
history of a lineage because in the end we want to understand the processes that have driven the
evolution of the group. Diversity dynamic means looking at the possible processes responsible for the
diversity described at different time slides. We do not stay at the descriptive level. In the end it is
always about the processes!
RC Page 2, line 27: More characters are needed or the coding of more charachters are needed? I don't
think that the multiplication of characters would be good and necessary.
Both! Descriptions should be more detailed and provide more morphological information (more
characters), which we should then incorporate in our cladistic analyses (coding characters).
RC Page 3, line 37: It is unclear here why this character is inaplicable rather than "absent" in most
taxa. We need to read the comment on this character in ESM2 to understand that this character is
linked to character 192. Could you please be more explicit here? (Another possibility would have been
to add a character state to character 192 "notched anterior wing"). See also general comments.
It is not necessary to understand why the character is inapplicable for one or other taxon at this point.
The inferred relationship between the two characters sounds logic, but we still need to explore it
properly. I suggest reading Maddison and Fitzjohn (9).
RC Page 3, line 39: It is not clear for me. What does it mean here (not autapomorphic?)? How do you
assess this parameter?
Parsimony uninformative characters are those including the same character state for all taxa in the data
matrix or only one different score for a single taxon, thus representing an autapomorphic character.
These characters are useless to establish relationships among the taxa in the data matrix.
Such characters are not unusual in cladistic analyses of Mesozoic actinopterygians and it is important
to note them because you might read that a certain study is based on X number of characters, but if Y
of them are not informative, the phylogenetic hypothesis is only based on X-Y characters. In our case,
the analysis and the consequent phylogenetic hypothesis is based on 339 morphological characters, all
of them being parsimony informative.
Just in case it is not clear for the reviewer, the following paragraph after the reviewer’s comment
refers to autapomorphic character states, not autapomorphic characters. These are states within a
parsimony informative character.
RC Page 3, line 45: and also to diagnose the clades on the basis of the cladogram.
Diagnoses are useful in the praxis of low level taxonomy, but not so much for clades at higher
taxonomic levels. In any case, before diagnosing those clades, we first need to find stable taxonomic
definitions of them. Morphology based definitions or diagnoses of higher clades of neopterygians are
very instable because of the frequent change of the taxonomic content of the base of the clades.
In any case, the complete list of synapomorphies is included in the supplementary file S4.
RC Page 4, line 9: Did you try to run the analysis without enforcing this clade to see if the results
would be different?
No, we didn’t, as our data matrix was not constructed to resolve relationships among advanced
teleosts. It is not the aim of our study to explore relationships at that level of the phylogeny and it
would not be correct to throw hypotheses of relationships at that level based on our data matrix.
Teleocephala and Clupeocephala represent enormous radiations and include an immense range of
morphological variation. Our data matrix includes only 10 species of Teleocephala, 7 of them are
clupeocephalans. One cannot expect these few species will give any meaningful insight into the
relationships of within these very rich clades.
RC Page 13, line 21: Why do you chose a priori this topology, and not the one with Dapedium as
ginglymodians found in the other two analyses?
As explained in the methods: "We have used several concavity constants to explore variations in the
resulting pattern of relationships." These secondary analyses are exploratory and should lead to more
detailed research in a certain direction. Why does a certain taxon changes positions after implied
weighting is applied? It is simply another way to test the robustness of the clades obtained after the
equal weighted analysis.
We prefer the hypothesis given directly by the data as raw as possible and, thus, our main analysis is
the equal weighted analysis and the hypothesis resulted from this analysis is the one that drives our
main discussions and conclusions. We are convinced that a lot of work is still needed at the basic level
of data collection (character coding and scoring) before we start worrying about the methods of tree
search. A more robust data set will give a more robust pattern of relationships that will not change
significantly after implied weights are applied. Also, recent studies have found that implied weighting
performs worse than equal weighting (14).
We now added a statement to make this clear in the methods section.
Reviewer: 2
General: Why are pycnodonts excluded?
Pycnodonts, as several other neopterygians are not included in our analysis for simple practical
reasons. We have tried to encompass as many neopterygian groups as possible, but only if there was
enough published morphological information and/or specimens available to us for first hand
examination, and if at least one of us had previous experience and was well acquainted with the
anatomy of the group, so that we could confidently evaluate and decide on potential conflicts of
homology. In the case of pycnodonts, the first two requisites (published information and specimens),
but none of us has experience working with these fishes and, thus, we did not include this group. With
this work we have done a first step, but it is clear that a lot of work remains to be done!
4.1 Relative position of the dorsal fin (character 1). What influence did this biomechanically-relevant
trait have on the topology of the tree? I would expect that it would be highly homoplastic given the
functional implications, and would recommend reformulation around a more phylogenetically relevant
aspect of this trait if not removal. Even though it’s been used in previous studies, it is confounding
factor in reconstructing phylogeny considering demonstrated convergence in ecomorphological studies
of living and fossil fishes.
Homoplasy is not necessarily spurious (15) and characters that are homoplastic at a certain level might
support relationships at a higher level.
To summarize, we are basically against discarding evidence and for collecting as much evidence as
possible following Kluge’s concept of total evidence “in terms of maximizing explanatory power, …
minimizing ad hoc hypotheses of homoplasy … whereby explanatory power and degree of
corroboration are maximized by maximizing severity of test” (16).
Also, “in order to exclude logically consistent evidence …, the investigator must argue that ‘‘the
premises constitute either the total evidence e available at the time or else a part of e which supports
the conclusion to the same extent as does e’’ (17). Thus, even less severe weighting, as well as
partitioning evidence, requires justification. Furthermore, including all relevant evidence can be seen
as a harmless activity, unless one is prepared to argue a priori that certain evidence will confound the
analysis and must therefore be eliminated.” (5).
And, “Although concern for character dependence is generally valid, it is often misplaced, focusing on
functional or developmental correlation (both of which are irrelevant in phylogenetic systematics but
may be valid in other fields) instead of the historical / transformational independence relevant to
phylogenetic inference.” (18)
To finish, the reviewer unfortunately does not explain what is meant with “a more phylogenetically
relevant aspect of this trait” and seem to suggest that a biomechanically-relevant trait cannot have a
phylogenetic signal per se. If this statement would be correct, we would have to eliminate an
enormous amount of phylogenetically important morphological information with functional
implications such as the relative position of the lower jar articulation (ch. 69), symplectic relationship
to lower jaw (ch. 83), relationship between the maxilla and preopercle (ch. 155), teeth organization on
premaxilla (ch. 178) and on dentary (ch. 182), presence of uroneurals in caudal fin (ch. 273), among
others. Organisms are functional units and most of the characters we use in phylogeny have some
morphofunctional meaning (anatomical changes related to the evolution of flight in theropod
dinosaurs, the evolution of the tetrapod limbs, etc.), but they still have a phylogenetic signal. There is
also a general idea that features such as endocranial characters, might be less homoplastic and would
have a stronger phylogenetic signal, but several papers have shown that this is not the case (e.g. (19)).
5.3 “crown-neopterygians”
Thanks! Corrected.
Page 14, line 51: What does “increasiningly large and stout basal fulcra” mean more specifically, and
how is this synapomorphy for Neoginglymodi distinguished from other enlarged fulcra (since it’s not
homoplastic in your tree)? Is there a better way to describe this?
We have modified the descriptions of the states of characters 312-313 and added a brief discussion of
this character to the Supplementary File S2. The morphological variation of the basal fulcra in
neopterygian fishes is rather poorly known. Our characters 312-313 will hopefully call the attention on
these features and more detailed descriptions and research will certainly improve the definition of
these characters.
Fig. 11 – What would happen if you timescaled this tree quantitatively, instead of assuming short
branches subtending the first occurrences, and long ghost lineages? How would that affect your
interpretations of the timing of diversification?
When preparing the manuscript, we had the intention to calibrate the strict consensus tree by using a
quantitative calibration method (e.g. MSM, MSM*, GER indexes). However, these quantitative
methods (which can be implemented in both TNT and PAUP) have some methodological concerns
that made the results less reliable regarding our dataset. The tree root needs a given age; they have a
much better resolution when involving a low number of taxa (generally 30, up to 50 taxa) which
represents almost half our taxonomic sample; they only allow a maximum of 35 different ages (20);
and they need a fully resolved tree to be analyzed (our equal weighted strict consensus tree has several
trichotomies, see Fig. 8). The later requirement implies choosing between one of the 24 most
parsimonious trees obtained in the analysis, or comparing 24 different calibration results.
We further, tried to calibrate our phylogenetic hypothesis in Mesquite by using the Stratigraphic Tools
package (21) but we found out it has some assumptions that made it not so useful for our objective.
First, each species occupies at least an entire geological stage (the minimum geochronological unit we
used). This assumption implies losing a lot of important stratigraphic information of the taxa included
in our data matrix, as the first occurrence of many taxa takes place within a certain stage (e.g.
Ophiopsiella, Ionoscopus, Solnhofenamia, which have their first occurrences in the Late
Kimmeridgian, see Fig. 11). Second, the length of internal branches is chosen by the user. Although
generally an internal branch length from 1 My to 4 My is chosen (see for example (22)), there is no
objective method to decide between one or another and the difference between one value and the other
is sufficient to generate different calibrations of the same tree.
Therefore, due to the impracticability of using quantitative indexes for calibration and the inaccuracy
of the Stratigraphic Tools package of Mesquite, the manual calibration of our phylogenetic hypothesis
turned to be the most accurate way to show the first occurrence of each species, as well as its duration.
Character 3: Ornamentation. Character states 0 and 1 seem to be overly broad. Is there any specific
pattern for ornamentation loss? If not, It might be better as a two-state double-“autopamorphy” for
obaichthyid gars and Pliodetes (presence/absence of odontodes). Are there patterns beyond ridges and
tubercles which might contain phylogenetic signal?
As with many other characters, we took the observed variation in our data matrix to draw the lines to
define the proposed character states and, as stated repeatedly in the manuscript and here, future
research should refine our definitions. Based on our observations, it is not possible to separate the
ornamentations made of tubercles from that made of ridges because, although both extremes are
known, most taxa show a mixture of them. These changes sometimes occur during ontogeny with
tubercles growing into ridges in the adult specimens. On the contrary, the distinction between our
states 0 (ornamented) and 1 (smooth or very slightly ornamented) is straight forwards in the praxis.
Concerning the sharp tubercles (state 3) present in obaichthyids and Pliodetes, they might represent
different structures, but there is no evidence distinguishing them from tubercles, so their homology is
here assumed. Resembling the case of the question of homology among the different types of scales
(see main text), histological studies are needed to propose more robust hypotheses of primary
homology for the different structures ornamenting the skull bones of actinopterygians.
Characters 5 and 6 – posterior margins of scales. Might these be generalized to decrease
inapplicability?
Characters 5 and 6 refer to the posterior margin of cycloid and ganoid scales, respectively. Although
cycloid and ganoid scales are homologous, there is no evidence that the crenulations at the posterior
border of the cycloid scales are homologous to the serrations at the posterior border of the ganoid
scales and they are luckily to be different kind of structures. Therefore, pending any evidence of
homology, they should be coded in different characters.
Character 10 – Squamation of the ventrum – there are probably other states here, since the ventral
scale patterns of most fishes have not been examined in detail. It’s not clear from Fig. S2 how the
ventral scales in these fishes are different from similar “shallowing” seen in a lot of other early
actinopterygians.
As explained in the discussion (5.1. second paragraph), several taxa, including the ginglymodian
†Ticinolepis, the halecomorphs †Archaeosemionotus, †Ophiopsis, †Ophiopsiella, the teleost
†Aspidorhynchus, and the more basal neopterygian †Australosomus, among the taxa included in our
data matrix, present this distinct squamation of the ventrum made of very shallow scales. Thus, it is
still not clear if this feature has a phylogenetic signal or not. Using our character in future cladistic
analyses is the best way to find the answer to this question. In doing so, we might of course find other
character states, but this is not possible based on the few taxa showing this distinct pattern in our data
matrix. When proposing this, as well as all the other new characters we not only seek to score the
observed variation that was not encompassed by previously proposed characters, but we also hope to
promote research exploring these features in further detail!
Characters 11-12: Not only semionotids have dorsal ridge scales… This might be a symplesiomorphy
not picked up by an analysis excluding “palaeoniscoids”
The presence of a complete series of dorsal ridge scales between the skull and the dorsal fin is a
uniquely derived synapomorphy of the clade formed by †Sangiorgioichthys and more derived
ginglymodians in our analysis. If “palaeoniscoids” with dorsal ridge scales were included in the
analysis, we should first refine the definition of the character states, distinguishing at least the
presence of a series spreading along the complete dorsal midline between the skull and the dorsal fin,
or a shorter series occupying only part of that length (e.g. Pseudobeaconiidae (23)). Only afterwards
we would be able to test the phylogenetic implications of these features, which, although homoplastic
at a certain level, they might still become synapomorphic of the clade mentioned above.
93. Dermopterotic length. There might be an obvious break between over 50% and less than 50%, and
over 30 and under 30, but the rest seem arbitrary and continuous.
This feature certainly needs to be explored in more detail. Not only the relative length, but also the
shape of the dermopterotic seem to include some phylogenetic signal.
131. number of anterior infraorbitals: The “or mores” should be removed except for state 6
Deleting “or more” from the description would not be correct because, as explained in the brief
discussion of this character (ch. 131) in the Supplementary File S2: “The number of anterior
infraorbital bones is intraspecifically and in some cases even individually variable. Therefore, we
score the minimal number of anterior infraorbitals.”
145. Distribution of suborbitals: Not clear what “outspread anteriorly” means.
We have modified the descriptions of the character states, which are hopefully clear now.
184-187. Is the shape of the teeth phylogenetically informative?
As suspected by previous authors, there seem to be some phylogenetic signal in these characters, but
they certainly need more study.
199. Ornamentation of opercle – does this cover all group-specific variation?
As far as we can judge, our character states work well, covering the variation observed among the taxa
included in our analysis.
207. Brachiostegal counts – why is a different range used? Is there a plot as for the other discrete states
assigned to continuous values?
We now added a plot indicating the ranges used to define the different states of this character.
301 – number of dorsal fin rays – this is a function of fin shape? The distribution show suggests it isn’t
particularly informative.
Character 301(3) is a synapomorphy uniquely derived in Amiinae sensu Grande and Bemis (24) (see
list of synapomorphies in the supplementary file S4). See also answer to the comment regarding the
dorsal fin.
302 – what is the distribution of this fin shape character?
Unfortunately, most authors have not payed much attention to the shape of the dorsal fin (as well as
the other fins, except the caudal fin). Therefore, as with many other characters, we still don’t know
much about the potential phylogenetic meaning of this character.
The figure below shows the distribution of this feature in our data set.
306 and 307 – see dorsal fin
