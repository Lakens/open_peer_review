The paper is a nice and comprehensive study of the evolution of a particular folksonomy.
I suggest the author to mention the results on hypergraphs sketched in

As for the adjacent possible idea, its application in the form a generative model of Polya urns is
referred to a paper of the same authors. Also in this case there is quite a number of similar
approaches. We just mention Complex Weighted Networks as Randomly Reinforced Urn

only for the specific relation holding between Polya urns and Rich get richer mechanism. But in
general all of them can be simply considered as a different kind of Yule processes.
The article would certainly benefit from an introduction where all these points are discussed and
presented to the reader in the spirit of Mitzenmacher paper

Passing to the analysis, the metrics introduced to assess the feature of the corpus of music
production are certainly interesting. I find necessary to add a brief description of a null case
against which one can evaluate the significance of the results obtained.

The manuscript entitled "Significance and Popularity in Music Production" by Monechi et al
describes the evolution of musical albums in terms of folksonomic tags. Inspired by Kauffman's
3
writing on the adjacent possible, they introduce a set of observables that describe how music
explores new themes. As a main result, the authors are able to identify some topological
conditions that seem to be indicative of cultural significance and/or popularity. Overall, the
paper presents a novel and statistically sound dynamic network analysis approach to the
important question of how influential new trends emerge in socio-economic systems. A weaker
point of the paper is that the authors, therefore, introduce a sometimes overwhelming number of
new observables. For some of them it is not really clear whether they are indeed necessary, or to
which extent they are confounded by other, more commonly known network characteristics.
However, I'm more than sure that the authors can address these concerns in a revised version and
recommend publication of this manuscript after minor revisions. In particular, the following
comments might be of interest to the authors.
-) As the authors briefly state in the "Data" section, such music databases contain often several
releases of th same album, in particular of the most influential ones. How have the authors dealt
with multiple releases?
-) The authors could make their results even stronger, if they compare their findings to results
obtained by replacing the Louvain community detection algorithm by a different clustering
method, such as Infomap, OSLOM, LDA, or other related approaches.
-) At some places, it seems that results are reported in the data section. For instance, the
correlation among the variables introduced, last paragraph in the data section, is maybe better
placed in the results section.
-) Speaking of which, I think Figure 3 needs to be a bit improved and expanded. It would be
much easier for the reader if the names of the variables are given in the rows. In addition, this is a
good place to discuss how these new measures relate to commonly known network measures,
such as in-degree, out-degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, eigenvector/alpha
centrality, or PageRank. Maybe it even turns out that some of the new variables are very similar
to one of those and the number of newly introduced ones can therefore be reduced...
-) I haven't found a description of how many albums are contained in the categories (popular,
highly popular, etc). However, for the prediction of the album category it might be informative to
additionally report the AUROC for the highest scoring albums, say, only the Top 100, as in some
classification tasks these might be the most relevant ones.
-) Introduction, 2nd paragraph: "folsnonomy" instead of "folksonomy"
-) Page 7, first line: "has contributed"

The paper is a nice and comprehensive study of the evolution of a
rticular folksonomy.I suggest the author to mention the results on
pergraphs sketched in

ldarelli, M.E.J. Newman, Physical Review E 79, 066118 (2009) and for a
re general treatment Hypernetworks in the Science of Complex Systems by
ffrey Johnson World Scientific 2014.
SPONSE: We agree hypergraphs are well-suited to mathematically model
lksonomy networks and hence we added these two references to the main
xt, briefly discussing their importance.
As for the adjacent possible idea, its application in the form a
nerative model of Polya urns is referred to a paper of the same
thors. Also in this case there is quite a number of similar
proaches. We just mention Complex Weighted Networks as Randomly

ysical Review E 87, 020106(R) (2013) only for the specific relation
lding between Polya urns and Rich get richer mechanism. But in general
l of them can be simply considered as a different kind of Yule
ocesses.
e article would certainly benefit from an introduction where all these
ints are discussed and presented to the reader in the spirit of
tzenmacher paper
brief history of generative models for power law and lognormal
stributions. Internet Mathematics 1, 226–251 (2003).
SPONSE: We agree with the reviewer that for clarity sake, we need to
d a brief discussion on the application of Polya's Urn to Complex
twork and Complex Systems modelling. We also added a statement
garding the fact that the application to biological systems and
novation dynamics requires the introduction of the concept of novelty
thin the basic Polya's Urn. In the main text:
he application of P\'oyla Urns as generative models is not anew in
plied Mathematics and Complex Systems Science and transcends the
plication to Innovation Dynamics and expanding spaces. The existence of
inforcement effects in the dynamics of Complex Networks for example,
kes them suited to be generated with variants of P\'oyla Urns processes
ite{caldarelli2013weighted}, featuring the ``rich-get-richer'' effect
so known as ``Yule Process'' \cite{yule1925mathematical}. The
plication to Innovation Dynamics requires the introduction of
nditions for the arrival of innovations as formalized for the first
me in the ``Hoppe Urn Model'' \cite{hoppe1987sampling} and extended in
ite{tria2014dynamics} in order to model the appearance of new elements
the consequence of the introduction of novelties. "
Passing to the analysis, the metrics introduced to assess the feature
the corpus of music production are certainly interesting. I find
cessary to add a brief description of a null case against which one can
aluate the significance of the results obtained.
SPONSE: In order to assess the significance with respect to a random
se, we add null model respecting the temporal biases that can be found
the distribution of the Playcount and in the belonging to an expert
de list (e.g. it is easier to be significant if the album is old and to
popular if it is recent). To this end, we divided the whole sample of
bums in time frames of 10 years. Hence, we randomly reassign the
aycount value between the albums belonging to the same time frame, and
do the same with the binary variables stating whether and album
longs to an expert made list or not. Finally, we used the
assification method and our metrics to predict the belonging to one of
e 4 categories in the main text with this new randomized sample. We
nd that generally, we are not able to classify the albums correctly or
at the prediction has considerably worsened.
the main text:
order to test the significance of the predictions, in Supporting
formation Section~D we show the same prediction for a randomized case
ere both the belonging to a category and the Playcount has been
ndomly reassigned among all the albums being released in the same
cade. The classification for this randomized case shows a significant
crease of the AuROC for each category, being in most cases very close
$0.5$.

sponse to Reviewer #2:
******************************
e manuscript entitled "Significance and Popularity in Music Production"
Monechi et al describes the evolution of musical albums in terms of
lksonomic tags. Inspired by Kauffman's writing on the adjacent
ssible, they introduce a set of observables that describe how music
plores new themes. As a main result, the authors are able to identify
me topological conditions that seem to be indicative of cultural
gnificance and/or popularity. Overall, the paper presents a novel and
atistically sound dynamic network analysis approach to the important
estion of how influential new trends emerge in socio-economic systems.
weaker point of the paper is that the authors, therefore, introduce a
metimes overwhelming number of new observables. For some of them it is
t really clear whether they are indeed necessary, or to which extent
ey are confounded by other, more commonly known network
aracteristics. However, I'm more than sure that the authors can address
ese concerns in a revised version and recommend publication of this
nuscript after minor revisions. In particular, the following comments
ght be of interest to the authors.
As the authors briefly state in the "Data" section, such music
tabases contain often several releases of th same album, in particular
the most influential ones. How have the authors dealt with multiple
leases?
SPONSE: Since we are interested in the way an album affects the global
sic production from the time it has been released to the vast public,
do not take into account multiple releases that will result in very
milar (if not identical) artworks created at different times. Hence, we
ltered out multiple releases by considering just the first release of
ch album. We specified this in the main text with the statement:
ltiple-release of the same album have been excluded from the sample
eping just the very first release.
The authors could make their results even stronger, if they compare
eir findings to results obtained by replacing the Louvain community
tection algorithm by a different clustering method, such as Infomap,
LOM, LDA, or other related approaches.
SPONSE: Concerning the arbitrary choice of the community detection
gorithm, we agree that in order to test the robustness of the findings
least another clustering method has to be used. Since LDA suffers from
oblems due to the size of our data, we decided to use another community
tection algorithm and hence group albums according to the resulting
mmunity structure as it has been done with the Lovain method. We
cided to use the OSLOM Algorithm and we recomputed the Burstiness,
instreamness, Uchronia Entropy and Topical Entropy using the
mmunities found with it. We then proceded to use the Random Forest
gorithm to predict the belonging of the albums to our 4 categories,
oving that the results are mostly unvaried with respect to the Louvain
se. In the main text:
st of the metrics introduced in this work depend on the particular
mmunity structure we considered. In all the results discussed above, we
ed the Louvain method for community detection\cite{blondel2008fast}.
order to test the robustness of our predictions with respect to
riations in identifying communities,
repeated all the measures when the community structure is identified
using the OSLOM Algorithm \cite{lancichinetti2011finding}. In
ction~E of Supporting Information, we show that even with this
fferent method we are able to predict the belonging to each category
th almost the same accuracy. Moreover, the most important metrics for
e various predictions remain the same.
At some places, it seems that results are reported in the data
ction. For instance, the correlation among the variables introduced,
st paragraph in the data section, is maybe better placed in the results
ction.
SPONSE: We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and we do agree that
e discussion of the correlation between the metrics introduced have to
placed in the Results section. We created an appropriate subsection of
e Results section and moved the discussion there.
Speaking of which, I think Figure 3 needs to be a bit improved and
panded. It would be much easier for the reader if the names of the
riables are given in the rows. In addition, this is a good place to
scuss how these new measures relate to commonly known network measures,
ch as in-degree, out-degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness
ntrality, eigenvector/alpha centrality, or PageRank. Maybe it even
rns out that some of the new variables are very similar to one of those
d the number of newly introduced ones can therefore be reduced...
SPONSE: We do understand the concerns of the reviewer about the metrics
troduced, but it is our opinion that many standard metrics typically
ed for the characterisation of Complex Network would not be suited for
e task of understanding the properties of albums and their relation
th the global music production represented by the growing co-occurrence
twork. In fact, many of these metrics aim at identifying the most
central'' or ``influential'' nodes, which is not necessarily what we
e looking for in many of the metrics introduced. However, we agree that
comparison with some well-known metrics will add relevant information
the work. Hence, we expanded Figure 3 by adding the name of the
trics in the rows and 4 standard network metrics (namely In-Degree,
t-Degree, Betweenness Centrality and Eigenvector Centrality). All these
trics result being correlated with one another and concerning the
trics introduced they show a strong correlation or anti-correlation
th the Uchronia, Uchronia Entropy and Ajdacent Possible metrics which
n be in fact considered centrality metrics. In the main text we also
ded:
e metrics introduced have also been compared with well-known network
ntrality metrics such as In-Degree, Out-Degree, Betweenness Centrality
d Eigenvector Centrality, corresponding to the rows and columns outside
e dotted square in Fig.~\ref{fig3}. These metrics are computed over
e co-occurrence network whose nodes are tags, and we assigned to each
bum the value corresponding to the average over its tags. We can see
at these metrics are highly correlated between each other, and feature
e same correlations patterns with the other metrics introduced in this
rk, i.e., they are correlated or anti-correlated in the same way with
e other metrics. Hence, they seem to carry similar information
garding the properties of the albums. Unsurprisingly, they exhibit
rger (anti-)correlations with the Uchronia, Uchronia Entropy and
jacent Possible metrics, which can be regarded as network centrality
trics.
I haven't found a description of how many albums are contained in the
tegories (popular, highly popular, etc). However, for the prediction of
e album category it might be informative to additionally report the
ROC for the highest scoring albums, say, only the Top 100, as in some
assification tasks these might be the most relevant ones.
SPONSE: We reported the numbers of albums in each category in the main
xt (41053 for the Popular, 7325 for the Highly Popular, 619 for the
/NME and, 509 for the GHF/NRR categories). As for the reduction of the
assification to the Top 100 highest scoring albums with RFA, we really
ink that due to the small numbers of the last two categories such
duction would not result in new information but rather in lesser
tegorization performances.
nally, we thank the reviewer for signalling those misprints and we
naged to correct them.
