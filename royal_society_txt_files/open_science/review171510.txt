The manuscript by J. Sun and co-workers reported a well planned and excellently executed study
on gypsogenin derivatives and their anti-cancer activity. The syntheses were well documented,
and all the compounds were thoroughly characterized. Their anti-cancer activities were examined
against four typical cancer cell lines (A549, LOVO, SKOV3, and HepG2). It was revealed that
chemical modifications at the 23 and 28-functional groups can bring substantial improvement in
anti-cancer activity. Overall, the experimental results were properly discussed, and the
conclusions were well supported. The manuscript was nicely written and free of error. Based on
the above assessments, I recommend this manuscript for publication in the Royal Society Open
Science.

The manuscript by Zhang et al. has developed some derivatives of gypsogenin and tested their
anticancer effects on human cancer cells. There are certain concerns with manuscript that shall be
addressed by authors in order to proceed for publication.
1. Abstract is very unclear. It will take to read whole paper for understanding abstract. Thus,
must be written very clearly. Naming and use of derivatives makes it confusing. More result shall
be discussed in the abstract section.
2. Introduction is also brief and bit unclear. Authors also need to highlight the novelty of the
study. When gypsogenin is already so much explore then what is the major question for this
study?
3. Experimental section is appropriate.

4. Results 2.2.1: Anticancer activity by means of MTT assay is to superficial. MTT assay reflects
only cytotoxicity. Data in figures 2-4 are more correlated to anticancer effect.
5. Authors are can say anticancer activity by MTT assay when the derivatives of gypsogenin
didn’t affect non-cancer cells. Thus, authors are suggested to analyses the effect of derivatives of
gypsogenin on non-cancer cell lines.

account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Reviewer 1
Decision: Accept
Response: Thanks very much for your comments to our paper. We are very grateful
for you recommend our manuscript for publication in the Royal Society Open Science.
Thank you again for your recognition to our paper.
Reviewer 2
Decision: Accept with minor revision
1. Abstract is very unclear. It will take to read whole paper for understanding abstract.
Thus, must be written very clearly. Naming and use of derivatives makes it confusing.
More result shall be discussed in the abstract section.
Response: It was revised in this paper and the revised portions were marked by using
red text.
2. Introduction is also brief and bit unclear. Authors also need to highlight the
novelty of the study. When gypsogenin is already so much explored then what is the
major question for this study?
Response: In previous study, the different pentacyclic triterpenoid derived amides
have been prepared and screened for their cytotoxic activity. The results reveal that
most of the carboxamides displayed good cytotoxicity in the low µ<U+039C> range for human
tumor cell lines. We have never found any references about the cytotoxicity of
gypsogenin derived amides. Thus, it is valuable for investigation about gypsogenin
derived amides. It was revised in this paper and the revised portions were marked by
using red text.
3. Experimental section is appropriate.
Response: Thank you for your recognition to our paper.
4. Results 2.2.1: Anticancer activity by means of MTT assay is too superficial. MTT
assay reflects only cytotoxicity. Data in figures 2-4 are more correlated to anticancer
effect.
Response: It was revised in this paper and the revised portions were marked by using
red text. We replaced ‘Anticancer activity’ with ‘Cytotoxic activity’.
5. Authors are can say anticancer activity by MTT assay when the derivatives of
gypsogenin didn’t affect non-cancer cells. Thus, authors are suggested to analyses the
effect of derivatives of gypsogenin on non-cancer cell lines.
Response: Gypsogenin, maslinic acid and oleanolic acid belong to pentacyclic
triterpenoid. Their structures are very similar. In previous study, oleanolic acid and
maslinic acid were showed high cytotoxicity for a variety of human tumor cell lines
but also rather low cytotoxicity for non-malignant mouse <U+FB01>broblasts NIH 3T3[1, 2].
In addition, the different oleanolic acid derived amides have been prepared and
screened for their cytotoxic activity. The results were also showed high cytotoxicity
for a variety of human tumor cell lines but also rather low cytotoxicity for non-
malignant mouse <U+FB01>broblasts NIH 3T3 [2]. Thus, it is not have to analyses the effect of
derivatives of gypsogenin on non-cancer cell lines.
