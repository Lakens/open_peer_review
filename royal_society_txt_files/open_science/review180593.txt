The authors investigate the effect of fact-checks on both beliefs (about the myths/facts presented)
and support for politicians who have been fact-checked. This is a well-researched and obviously
very timely manuscript that I think should be published. However, I do have two concerns that I
think should be addressed. The primary concern pertains to the results and the secondary
concern pertains to the framing of the manuscript.
Results
The most important issue is that the full design is underpowered and the results section is (in my
view, needlessly) hard to follow. There are 12 between subject conditions and only 370
participants (~30 participants per cell). Moreover, even this low level of power is maintained
because of what I take to be an inappropriate split of the sample on political ideology. That is, I
don’t think it is appropriate to split the groups based on sample characteristics (into 3 equally
numerous groups). This is because if the sample skews left (as it does), there are people in the
neutral category that are left-wing and people in the right-wing category that are neutral.
Left/Neutral/Right should be determined based on where they fall on the political spectrum,
even if it means there will be fewer participants in some of the cells. This probably played a large
role in why the left-wing participants were more extreme (as per the analyses on page 17).
Moreover, the neutral group really isn’t relevant here (apart from acting as a control, although it
is hard to interpret data from such people since they could be genuine moderates or just
apathetic). So, one possibility to gain power is to make as the primary test the data recoded so
that the politician and ideology are either congruent (left-wing participant, Shorten condition/
right-wing participant, Turnbull condition) or incongruent (right-wing participant, Shorten
condition/ left-wing participant, Turnbull condition), as done on page 17 (the full ANOVA can
be reported in a supplement). For clarity, this will result in the following design: 2 (fact-check:
pre, post) x 2 (myth: 4:1, 4:4) x 2 (congruency: congruent, incongruent). This means that neutral
participants are dropped and that ideological asymmetry can’t be investigated in the full design,
but it will increase the sample to (I’m guessing) around 50 per cell. I should also note that this
analysis addresses the central issue, as elucidated in the “summary of main results” section (p.
21). It also means that a single central test can be used to test the key motivated reasoning
hypothesis: i.e., that fact-check will interact with congruency and that this interaction will be
sourced by a smaller effect in the incongruent case. The authors are free (in my view) to report
whatever additional tests they like, but I think this really should be the central analysis reported
at the beginning of the results section (for all DVs).
Regarding ideological asymmetry, it would make sense to simply correlate the political ideology
measure with a fact-check difference score (post minus pre) separately for the Shorten and
Turnbull conditions. That is, I don’t think the myth-ratio manipulation is important for the
asymmetry question. The correlation will tell you if conservatives are less responsive to the fact-
check than liberals and whether this depends on ideological congruency (Shorten v. Turnbull).
The interaction between ideology and Shorten/Turnbull condition can be tested in a regression as
well (averaging across myth-ratio condition, interacting Shorten/Turnbull condition with
conservatism). As above, this analysis retains the most power while addressing the central
question.
3
Obviously, these are just suggestions. But, regardless, the full design is underpowered and it is
not appropriate to categorize individuals as left-wing/neutral/right-wing based on sample
characteristics instead of self-identification.
Another note on the results is that the inferences are driven by interpretation of the patterns that
emerge from significant interactions, but follow-up tests weren’t apparently run (with some
exceptions). For example (p.16): “There were two further unexpected interactions: a significant
interaction of fact-check, myth:fact ratio, and political orientation, which was further qualified by
a significant fourway interaction. This result indicated that myth belief reduced more among
neutral participants in the 4:1 than the 4:4 condition, especially for Turnbull myths, while myth
belief reduced similarly regardless of the myth:fact ratio among left-wing and right-wing
participants.” It is unclear if all of the individual effects that are mentioned are significant on their
own. The significant interaction warrants the follow-ups, but it doesn’t mean that every
difference that (once added up to produce a significant interaction) is itself significant. [Note that
the authors did do this for perhaps one of the most central analyses, which is somewhat buried in
the results: last paragraph of page 19 and first paragraph of page 20]. I think my suggested
revisions to the results might simplify things a bit.
Introduction/Framing
My first comment is simple: “Attitude” is used throughout but not fully defined.
I am also a bit unclear on how different is the attitude-protection hypothesis is from the identity-
protective cognition hypothesis (as per Kahan)? One possibility, which the authors may or may
not agree with, is that the former is an important specification of the latter. Kahan’s account says
that people will engage in motivated reasoning to protect their political (or otherwise) identities.
However, this can be taken broadly to imply that any information that might conflict with one’s
identity (such as Trump’s inaccurate statements in Swire et al., 2017) will lead to motivated
reasoning. Here, the specification is that “identity” might be too broad and that motivated
reasoning occurs as a result of conflict with a specific attitude (although, as mentioned, this term
needs to be defined). At any rate, the connection between these accounts should be addressed in
the manuscript. (Although, I should add, the attitude-protection hypothesis isn’t really tested
here.)

Comments to the Author:
label_comment_2
I have received a very thorough and constructive review from an expert reviewer, and I have also
read the paper myself. I agree with the reviewer's comments and would like you to revise your
paper according to these suggestions. In particular, please provide the following additional
analyses:
(1) An analysis that collapses across ideology, 2 (fact-check: pre, post) x 2 (myth: 4:1, 4:4) x 2
(congruency: congruent, incongruent).
6
(2) An analysis that defines political ideology according to absolute position on the scale (e.g. into
two groups above vs. below the midpoint), even if this means there are unequal numbers of
participants in the left vs. right groups.
I will leave it up to you as to how to best organize a revised results section. Please consider the
reviewer's suggestions on this point, and his comment that the results section in the current
manuscript was rather hard to follow. The complexity of the design (resulting in reports of up to
4-way interactions) can be challenging for readers, so I would recommend more signposting
along the way, as well as appropriately placing results that are not central to the main hypotheses
into a supplemental results section.
When submitting your revised manuscript, please also provide a point-by-point response letter
addressing the reviewer's comments.

Appendix A
Response to Reviewers
Editor’s comments
1. Please provide the following additional analyses:
a. An analysis that collapses across ideology, 2 (fact-check: pre, post) x 2 (myth: 4:1,
4:4) x 2 (congruency: congruent, incongruent).
b. An analysis that defines political ideology according to absolute position on the scale
(e.g. into two groups above vs. below the midpoint), even if this means there are
unequal numbers of participants in the left vs. right groups.
RESPONSE: We followed the suggestion of using the scale mid-point to create two groups
rather than three. This did not lead to any major changes in results and their
interpretation/implications. One problem with the suggested fact-check x myth:fact ratio x
congruence analysis, however, is that it ‘hides’ the left-wing bias in our data, so we did not
feel comfortable following this suggestion. Instead, we decided to run a fact-check x
congruence x political orientation analysis—which is also easy to interpret but shows the
bias. We present analyses including the ratio factor in the supplement—as the reviewer
pointed out, that factor was primarily of interest for the analysis of support but not central to
the analysis of beliefs.
2. I will leave it up to you as to how to best organize a revised results section. Please consider
the reviewer's suggestions on this point, and his comment that the results section in the
current manuscript was rather hard to follow. The complexity of the design (resulting in
reports of up to 4-way interactions) can be challenging for readers, so I would recommend
more signposting along the way, as well as appropriately placing results that are not central
to the main hypotheses into a supplemental results section.
RESPONSE: We have followed the reviewer’s suggestions. We have simplified the Results
section substantially, placing additional analyses (ANOVA tables and an additional figure)
into the supplement. We were able to reduce the number of figures by two, as well. We think
the Results section is now much easier to follow.

1. The most important issue is that the full design is underpowered and the results section is

question. Obviously, these are just suggestions. But, regardless, the full design is
underpowered and it is not appropriate to categorize individuals as left-wing/neutral/right-
wing based on sample characteristics instead of self-identification.
Response: We already responded to the first point in response to the editor’s comments. The
correlational approach would also work (the more left-wing, the more belief in Shorten
myths is reduced, r = ~.30; the more right-wing, the more belief in Turnbull myths is reduced,
r = ~.17, so the effect is about half the size for Turnbull vs. Shorten) but we thought it was
largely redundant, so decided not to include this additional analysis.
2. Another note on the results is that the inferences are driven by interpretation of the
patterns that emerge from significant interactions, but follow-up tests weren’t apparently
run (with some exceptions). For example (p.16): “There were two further unexpected
interactions: a significant interaction of fact-check, myth:fact ratio, and political orientation,
which was further qualified by a significant fourway interaction. This result indicated that
myth belief reduced more among neutral participants in the 4:1 than the 4:4 condition,
especially for Turnbull myths, while myth belief reduced similarly regardless of the myth:fact
ratio among left-wing and right-wing participants.” It is unclear if all of the individual effects
that are mentioned are significant on their own. The significant interaction warrants the
follow-ups, but it doesn’t mean that every difference that (once added up to produce a
significant interaction) is itself significant. [Note that the authors did do this for perhaps one
of the most central analyses, which is somewhat buried in the results: last paragraph of page
19 and first paragraph of page 20]. I think my suggested revisions to the results might
simplify things a bit.
Response: We are now more consistent in reporting follow-up contrasts throughout the
Results section.
3. “Attitude” is used throughout but not fully defined.
Response: We now define the term on p.3.
4. I am also a bit unclear on how different is the attitude-protection hypothesis is from the
identity-protective cognition hypothesis (as per Kahan)? One possibility, which the authors
may or may not agree with, is that the former is an important specification of the latter.
Kahan’s account says that people will engage in motivated reasoning to protect their
political (or otherwise) identities. However, this can be taken broadly to imply that any
information that might conflict with one’s identity (such as Trump’s inaccurate statements in
Swire et al., 2017) will lead to motivated reasoning. Here, the specification is that “identity”
might be too broad and that motivated reasoning occurs as a result of conflict with a specific
attitude (although, as mentioned, this term needs to be defined). At any rate, the
connection between these accounts should be addressed in the manuscript. (Although, I
should add, the attitude-protection hypothesis isn’t really tested here.)
Response: We now make the connection explicit in a footnote on p.6: “One could view the
attitude-protection hypothesis as a special case of Kahan’s identity-protection hypothesis
(e.g., [25]), as attitudes are an integral part of a person’s social identity. However, the
emphasis here lies more on the premise that attitude-incongruent corrections may be fully
effective as long as they do not directly call for attitude change.”
