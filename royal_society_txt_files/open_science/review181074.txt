At present, with the popularity of deep camera systems, such as Microsoft's kinect, Apple's
iphoneX and other consumer devices have already adopted a deep camera system, but the
common problem is low precision. Based on the above background, this paper has carried out
research on the super-resolution enhancement method of depth image, which has good frontier
and practicality. This paper proposes a depth image enhancement method based on an improved
joint trilateral filter. More interesting is that this manuscript proposes a method for super-
resolution image reconstruction without relying on external databases or high-resolution images
to obtain prior information. The overall logical framework of the paper is clear and the overall
writing is better. The method description, demonstration and experiments are complete, and the
results are credible. But, some of the following questions should be considered:
1. I recommended having a native English speaker to go through this paper.
2. There are many spelling errors in the paper. For example, the characters Dl on the 5th line and
the 8th line of page 4 are garbled. Please modify
3. There is an error in the chapter number of the paper. For example, there exists inconsistency in
the subsection numbers in Sections 4 and 5.
4. Table 1 lists the 10 parameter values set before the experiment. How these parameter values
are determined should be explained in detail.
5. There are some bugs in the running of the attached program code. It is recommended to attach
a detailed program running instructions.
Generally, the manuscript is good with nice motivations, method and extensive experiments. I
recommend accepting this paper after minor revision.

The work at hand proposes an interesting method for deep image SR which needs neither the
external example database nor the assistance of the registered HR color image. The core of the
proposed method was named Edge Guided Joint Trilateral Filter. The whole paper is clear, well
written, and easy to follow the motivation. The theory is correctly derived and the experimental
analysis is sufficient. Overall I am not convinced of this manuscript in its current form.
1. The number of the references needs to be reorder. In Fig.3, the “Timofe [11]” is should be
[12]……
2. Overall the quality of the Figures is not satisfying. For example, the Fig.2 should be included as
vector graphics or in an adequate resolution, such that details are not covered by compression
artifacts. Or, maybe, the low resolution pictures which look not clear are waiting for SR?
3. Is there any discussion about table 6, why the running time of the proposed method is higher
than most other methods?

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
Thank you for supplying this revision. The referees are broadly content that your paper is ready
for acceptance -- the Editors would, however, like you to bear in mind the comments from one of
the reviewers that the figures in the manuscript need to be clarified. Please ensure this is
addressed during typesetting and proofing. Thank you for your support of Royal Society Open
Science.

Appendix A
Explanation of this revision
Thank you very much for your valuable comments, which has been very useful for improving the
quality of this paper. The details of the revision are as follows:
Question: 1
I recommended having a native English speaker to go through this paper.
Answer:
Thank you for your careful reading very much. The whole manuscript has been reedited by a
native English speaker who fixed many grammar and expression errors.
Question:2
There are many spelling errors in the paper. For example, the characters D l<U+F0A2> on the 5th line and
the 8th line of page 4 are garbled. Please modify
Answer:
The characters D l<U+F0A2> have been modified on the 4th line and the 6th line of page 3, and further, we
also examined the entire manuscript and eliminated the similar problem.
Question:3
There is an error in the chapter number of the paper. For example, there exists inconsistency in
the subsection numbers in Sections 4 and 5.
Answer:
Thank you for your reminder. We have reedited the subsection numbers in Sections 4 and 5.
Question:4
Table 1 lists the 10 parameter values set before the experiment. How these parameter values are
determined should be explained in detail.
Answer:
The selection of parameters is introduced on the lines 26-30 of page 5 in detail.
Question:5
There are some bugs in the running of the attached program code. It is recommended to attach a
detailed program running instructions.
Answer:
The new version of the codes has been uploaded to the Dryad website, which added the program
description, and some bugs have been fixed. You can download the new codes from the URL:

Appendix B
Explanation of this revision
Thank you very much for your valuable comments which has been very useful for improving the
quality of this paper. The details of the revision are as follows:
Question:1
The number of the references needs to be reorder. In Fig.3, the “Timofe [11]” is should be
[12]……
Answer:
Thank you for your careful reading very much. The numbers of the references have been
reordered in Fig.3 and Fig.4.
Question: 2
Overall the quality of the Figures is not satisfying. For example, the Fig.2 should be included as
vector graphics or in an adequate resolution, such that details are not covered by compression
artifacts. Or, maybe, the low resolution pictures which look not clear are waiting for SR?
Answer:
The original figures are very large, so what show in Fig.1 and Fig.2 are compressed screenshots.
High resolution images have replaced the unclear images.
Question:3
Is there any discussion about table 6, why the running time of the proposed method is higher
than most other methods?
Answer:
Thanks very lot for your reminder. The proposed method needs construct dataset and train
sparse dictionary before depth image SR, so the running time is higher. And the explanation has
been added on the lines 13-14 of page 8 in the manuscript.
