The manuscript reports an interesting study on the electronic structure, interatomic bonding,
optical and mechanical properties of the multicomponent pyrophosphate crystal K2Mg
(H2P2O7)2·2H2O. They use the OLCAO method to perform the theoretical analysis.
They concluded that the current crystal structure from XRD is not accurate. The results by the
OLCAO method reveal the bonding nature of K-O, Mg-O, P-O bonds and so on.
The paper surely deserves publication. Yet, the following points should be addressed.
1. This paper looks like an application of the OLCAO method. The relationship between the
4.1~4.3 parts and the 4.4 ~ 4.5 parts in the discussion is weak. Does the bonding nature in
pyrophosphate crystal influence its optical and mechanical properties?
2. In Page 3, “such as hybrid functional PBE0, HSE03” should be “such as hybrid functionals
PBE0, HSE03”
In Page 6, the first paragraph of conclusion:
“It is concluded that the existing crystal structure data from XDR” should be “It is concluded that
the existing crystal structure data from XRD”.
In Page 6, the second paragraph of conclusion:
“and its structural analysis may be qustionable” should be “and its structural analysis may be
questionable”
In Page 6, the final paragraph of conclusion:
This sentence, “a connection between the vibrational properties and the electronic structure could
be more closely linked together with the availability of new information on charge transfer and
bond strength in the form or bond order.” is puzzled and unclear. It should be re-written in a
simple and clear form.

This is a very well-written and well-organized paper. It reports the optimal structure and a
number of different important properties of a pyrophosphate compound, such as band structure,
partial charge, optical properties and refractive index, and mechanical properties. The authors
also included a valuable suggestion that DFT calculations would be important to be use routinely
in combination with experimental crystallographic studies, which the reviewer totally agrees.
There are several comments that the authors should take into consideration before the paper can
be published:
1. Table 1 should include the uncertainties (standard deviations) of the measured results
pertaining to the XRD data.
2. Figure 2b, the color of the hydrogen spheres is not ‘white’ as mentioned in the figure legend.
3. Page 2, 2nd line, “….. are also an important part biomaterials….” should be “…. are also an
important part of biomaterials….”
4. In Table 1 and Fig. 7, while the O-H bond lengths have been improved with DFT calculations,
the hydrogen bonding distances appear to be somewhat short at 1.304 and 1.349 Ang. In general,
the lowest limit of a short hydrogen O…H bond has been reported to be around 1.7 Å. There
seems to be possible wrong labeling for the O…H bonds. The authors should check about these
distances in case there are mislabeling or typographical errors.

Appendix A
Dear Chief Editor,
We have thoroughly reviewed the comments of reviewers on our manuscript entitled “Complex Interplay
of Interatomic Bonding in a Multi-component Pyrophosphate Crystal: K2Mg (H2P2O7)2·2H2O”. Based on
these comments, we have revised the manuscript accordingly. We deeply appreciate the time spent by
the referees in reading our paper carefully and providing us with very constructive recommendations
and comments, which we have fully addressed. The following is our point-to-point response to these
comments. The reviewer’s comments are listed as italics for easy reference. The corresponding
modifications/additions to the text are colored in light blue.
Reviewer: 1
The manuscript reports an interesting study on the electronic structure, interatomic bonding, optical and
mechanical properties of the multicomponent pyrophosphate crystal K2Mg (H2P2O7)2·2H2O. They use
the OLCAO method to perform the theoretical analysis.
They concluded that the current crystal structure from XRD is not accurate. The results by the OLCAO
method reveal the bonding nature of K-O, Mg-O, P-O bonds and so on.
The paper surely deserves publication. Yet, the following points should be addressed.
1. This paper looks like an application of the OLCAO method. The relationship between the 4.1~4.3 parts
and the 4.4 ~ 4.5 parts in the discussion is weak. Does the bonding nature in pyrophosphate crystal
influence its optical and mechanical properties?
Response: The bonding of pyrophosphate crystals influences the mechanical and optical properties
through their electronic structure. The total bond order density (TBOD) represents the normalized total
bond order or strength of the system. Mechanical properties are more complicated. They provide us
broader information about the system related to compression and elasticity. The stronger system is less
compressible.
2. In Page 3, “such as hybrid functional PBE0, HSE03” should be “such as hybrid functionals PBE0,
HSE03”
Response: Thank you, the typo has been corrected.
In Page 6, the first paragraph of conclusion:
“It is concluded that the existing crystal structure data from XDR” should be “It is concluded that the
existing crystal structure data from XRD”.
Response: Thank you, the typo has been corrected.
In Page 6, the second paragraph of conclusion:
“and its structural analysis may be qustionable” should be “and its structural analysis may be
questionable”
Response: Thank you, the typo has been corrected.
In Page 6, the final paragraph of conclusion:
This sentence, “a connection between the vibrational properties and the electronic structure could be
more closely linked together with the availability of new information on charge transfer and bond
strength in the form or bond order.” is puzzled and unclear. It should be re-written in a simple and clear
form.
Response: We agree with the referee 1 that this sentence is quite vague. It has been deleted.
Reviewer: 2
This is a very well-written and well-organized paper. It reports the optimal structure and a number of
different important properties of a pyrophosphate compound, such as band structure, partial charge,
optical properties and refractive index, and mechanical properties. The authors also included a valuable
suggestion that DFT calculations would be important to be use routinely in combination with
experimental crystallographic studies, which the reviewer totally agrees.
There are several comments that the authors should take into consideration before the paper can be
published:
1. Table 1 should include the uncertainties (standard deviations) of the measured results pertaining to
the XRD data.
Response: It is not feasible for us. We do not have ranges of measured results of XRD data.
2. Figure 2b, the color of the hydrogen spheres is not ‘white’ as mentioned in the figure legend.
Response: We have changed the color name to “pinkish white”.
3. Page 2, 2nd line, “….. are also an important part biomaterials….” should be “…. are also an important
part of biomaterials….”
Response: Thank you, the typo has been corrected
4. In Table 1 and Fig. 7, while the O-H bond lengths have been improved with DFT calculations, the
hydrogen bonding distances appear to be somewhat short at 1.304 and 1.349 Ang. In general, the
lowest limit of a short hydrogen O…H bond has been reported to be around 1.7 Å. There seems to be
possible wrong labeling for the O…H bonds. The authors should check about these distances in case
there are mislabeling or typographical errors.
Response: Yes, we agree with reviewer there has been mislabeling. We apologize for our oversight. The
bond length of 1.304 Å, 1.349 Å for O–H bonds are actually the bridging bonds (O–H–O) not hydrogen
bonds (O···H). We have made required changes in the text, Figure 6(b), Figure 7, Table 1, Table 3,
Table S1 and Table S2 supplementary document and have highlighted with blue ink.
Sincerely yours,
Wai-Yim Ching
