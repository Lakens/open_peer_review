# General comments #
In this manuscript, Shoko Sakai and colleagues present results of a study on variation in the
skewness of the degree distributions of plants and animals in pollination and seed dispersal
networks. To my knowledge, the question what factors determine this variation has not been
previously addressed in the ecological literature. Thus, this manuscript has the potential to
complement existing studies of interaction patterns in plant-animal mutualisms.
Overall, I found the manuscript to be mostly well-written, with clearly presented methods and
results. One of the main difficulties when working with binary interaction matrices is their
sensitivity to uneven numbers of observations per species, and I liked how the authors address
this issue by comparing the observed patterns to randomizations of the available quantitative
networks. However, I am concerned that some of the observed variation in degree distribution
skewness (DDS) might be due to another trivial factor, variation in the mean degree per species
which constrains the possible values of DDS. That is because if the mean degree (number of links
per species) in a community is low (close to 1), the degree distribution cannot be extremely
skewed because its heterogeneity is constrained by the requirement that each species must have
at least one link. If the mean degree is very high (i.e. connectance is close to 1), the degree
distribution can again not be very skewed because each species can only have at most one link
with each partner species. Since all empirical networks used by the authors have relatively low
connectance values, the constraint on skewness due to high mean degree should not affect the
results of the study, but the constraint due to low mean degree likely limits possible DDS values
of different networks to variable degrees. Hence, I think the authors should calculate the
maximum possible value of 1-E for the plant and animal community in each network, and
compare the observed values to these maxima.
In addition to this methodological issue, I am not entirely convinced by the author's
interpretation of the patterns of DDS in the Discussion (see specific comments below).
Admittedly, it is difficult to explain these patterns. I suggest that the authors try to interpret their
findings in terms of conditions that may favour or inhibit coexistence of specialists and
generalists in a community.
# Specific comments #
p. 3, l. 36: I would not use the term "network theory". Networks are a convenient way to describe
and visualize the structure of interactions between many entities, but they do not provide
mechanistic explanations for the observed interaction structures. They are a tool, not a theory.
p. 4, l. 25-27: What does "acting as a glue that keeps the network together" mean ecologically? I
know that similarly catchy and vague expressions have been used in other papers on mutualistic
networks, but I think the authors should at least explain what the implications of "keeping the
network together" are. Why should it make a difference whether all species are (indirectly)
connected to all others or not? One possible result of such network cohesion could be more
tightly coupled population dynamics, which might actually decrease community stability (see the
large number of papers on complexity-stability relationships in food webs).
3
p. 13, l. 5-15: I don't see why the network-level degree of specialization should affect the DDS
value of the animal community (1-E_A), except through the constraint on DDS that I mentioned
in my general comments above. I agree that plants have a higher interest in having specialized
pollinators than specialized seed dispersers. However, in my opinion that only explains why the
average degree of animals is lower in pollination networks compared to seed dispersal networks,
but not why the heterogeneity of animal degrees varies with network-level specialization in
pollination networks.
p. 13, l. 22-23: I agree that having specialized pollinators is most important for plant species that
occur at low density. However, that doesn't imply that rare plants should be more specialized
themselves (i.e. have few pollinators). Moreover, since being specialized on a rare plant is a
disadvantageous strategy from the perspective of a pollinator, I doubt that many rare plants have
specialized flower visitors. As far as I know, many specialized flower visitors, such as oligolectic
bees, visit common plant species that have many other visitors.

Comments on Sakai et al.
4
Sakai et al. have examined variation in degree distributions among ecological networks from
different climatic regions of the world and representing both pollination and seed dispersal. They
draw particular attention to whether or not animal and plant species in pollination and seed
dispersal networks show similar patterns of evenness in degree distributions. They then offer
explanations for these patterns based on evolutionary and partner-choice mechanisms operating
in plant-pollinator and plant-seed dispersal communities.
The findings are very interesting and an important contribution to network ecology. Among
other things, they find that plant and animal degree distribution evenness are inversely
correlated in pollination interactions, whereas such patterns are absent in seed dispersal. They
also find differences in evenness of plants and animals among climatic zones. As they say, the
fact that there is a lot of broad structural similarity between pollination and seed dispersal means
that the networks get discussed together often in the literature, but this broad similarity masks
the potential for important differences, which the authors address here.
The explanations for the patterns they observe is well-reasoned and although I’m not completely
sure their hypotheses are the most likely explanations, they offer much food for thought. Rather
than suggest that they modify or qualify their discussion, I recommend that this paper be
published in its current form so that the conclusions can be discussed by the rest of the network
ecology community.
The manuscript is well-written and very easy to read. I have only a few minor comments.

As suggested by the reviewer, we added a supplementary note, which includes the figure that
had been submitted as a part of the response letter in the previous revision together with a brief
description about the analysis. It is cited in the page 12 of the main text.
The change is highlighted with blue color in the main text.
Dear Editor:
We are pleased to resubmit for publication the revised version of RSOS­150630
“Geographical variation in the heterogeneity of mutualistic networks.” We appreciate
the constructive comments of the two reviewers. We have addressed each of their
concerns as outlined below. Major changes on the manuscript are highlighted.
Comments from the Reviewer 1
However, I am concerned that some of the observed variation in degree
distribution skewness (DDS) might be due to another trivial factor, variation in
the mean degree per species which constrains the possible values of DDS. That
is because if the mean degree (number of links per species) in a community is
low (close to 1), the degree distribution cannot be extremely skewed because its
heterogeneity is constrained by the requirement that each species must have at
least one link. If the mean degree is very high (i.e. connectance is close to 1),
the degree distribution can again not be very skewed because each species can
only have at most one link with each partner species. Since all empirical
networks used by the authors have relatively low connectance values, the
constraint on skewness due to high mean degree should not affect the results of
the study, but the constraint due to low mean degree likely limits possible DDS
values of different networks to variable degrees. Hence, I think the authors
should calculate the maximum possible value of 1-E for the plant and animal
community in each network, and compare the observed values to these maxima.
Reply: We understand the concern since we know that many factors and variables
co-vary in bipartite networks. To address the problem of co-variation, we
conducted different randomization analyses in our manuscript, such as random
interactions, adjustment of plant-animal ratio, and simulation of sampling effort
reduction.
Reviewer 1 suggested to examine the possibility that low mean degrees
constrain the values of 1–E by comparing the observed values of 1–E with the
potential maximum values of 1–E. To address the problem, we calculated the
potential maximum values (PMVs) of 1–EP and 1–EA independently for each
network under the constraint that (1) the numbers of plant and animal species and
the total number of links in the network is kept constant, (2) and all species have at
least one link. Then we compared the PMVs with the observed heterogeneity
values shown in figure 2. The results are summarized in figure R1 shown at the
end of this letter. We first conducted the analysis using the original networks and
no adjustment of the animal-plant ratio. We found that the PMVs of plants and
animals are negatively correlated for pollination and positively correlated for
seed-dispersal networks (fig. R1B). This is the same pattern as found for observed
networks (fig. R1A). Then, we conducted the analysis for networks with adjusted
animal-plant ratio as described in the manuscript. For pollination, we found that
the correlation of plant and animal PMVs was positive (fig. R1D), while that of
observed values was negative (fig. R1C). This suggests that the negative
correlation between PMVs (fig. R1B) is at least partly caused by the plant-animal
ratio, while the negative correlation between the observed values is not. In seed
dispersal, on the other hand, the relationships were always positive (fig. R1). The
positive correlations in seed dispersal may therefore be caused by structural
constraints of the networks as suggested by reviewer 1.
In conclusion, the approach suggested by reviewer 1 may help explain the
results for seed-dispersal. However, it does not offer simple explanations for the
negative correlation found among pollination networks and the differences
between seed-dispersal and pollination networks. Because the focus of our study is
on pollination networks rather than seed-dispersal, we did not add the analysis
shown figure R1 to main manuscript.
In addition to this methodological issue, I am not entirely convinced by the
author's interpretation of the patterns of DDS in the Discussion (see specific
comments below). Admittedly, it is difficult to explain these patterns. I suggest
that the authors try to interpret their findings in terms of conditions that may
favour or inhibit coexistence of specialists and generalists in a community.
Reply: The explanation for the observed pattern of DDS is now better connected to
conditions that allow for coexistence of specialists and generalists (Page 13, Line
270-290; see also response to specific comments below). Further, we acknowledge
in the discussion explicitly that the detected patterns are difficult to explain and
added the following sentences. “These results are difficult to explain, in particular
due to the limited knowledge of the processes that cause variation of specialization
among communities. Here, we cautiously interpret the results from an evolutionary
perspective.” (Page 13, Lines 268-270).
# Specific comments #
p. 3, l. 36: I would not use the term "network theory". Networks are a convenient
way to describe and visualize the structure of interactions between many entities,
but they do not provide mechanistic explanations for the observed interaction
structures. They are a tool, not a theory.
Reply: We have removed the term “network theory” and changed it to “network
representation”. The complete sentence reads now “In the last two decades,
network representation has emerged as an important tool for analyzing complex
ecological interactions, and several network characteristics are now well
described [3–5].” (Page 3, Line 43).
p. 4, l. 25-27: What does "acting as a glue that keeps the network together"
mean ecologically? I know that similarly catchy and vague expressions have
been used in other papers on mutualistic networks, but I think the authors should
at least explain what the implications of "keeping the network together" are. Why
should it make a difference whether all species are (indirectly) connected to all
others or not? One possible result of such network cohesion could be more
tightly coupled population dynamics, which might actually decrease community
stability (see the large number of papers on complexity-stability relationships in
food webs).
Reply: After reading the comment, we decided to delete the word glue from the
paragraph. We changed the text to “These generalist species form network hubs
and are proposed to play an important role in community stability [3] and to
reduce the probability of secondary species extinction [20]. Comparatively less
attention, however, has been paid to the questions whether the degree distribution
differs between the two parties of a bipartite network, whether different types of
mutualism differ with respect to their degree distribution, and whether there are
differences between geographic regions.” (Page 4, Lines 63-68). We also made a
change in the abstract accordingly (Page 2, Lines 16-17).
p. 13, l. 5-15: I don't see why the network-level degree of specialization should
affect the DDS value of the animal community (1-E_A), except through the
constraint on DDS that I mentioned in my general comments above. I agree that
plants have a higher interest in having specialized pollinators than specialized
seed dispersers. However, in my opinion that only explains why the average
degree of animals is lower in pollination networks compared to seed dispersal
networks, but not why the heterogeneity of animal degrees varies with
network-level specialization in pollination networks.
Reply: We agree that our previous discussion on specialization and DDS was not
convincing. We tried to clarify our ideas how specialization may affect the plant
and animal evenness and rewrote the whole part. It now reads as “On the contrary,
the positive correlation between DH2' and 1-EP may be due to the difference in the
advantage generalist and specialist plant species get from specialization (or
exclusion of inefficient pollinator). For a generalist plant species pollinated by
many animal species, the advantage from excluding an inefficient pollinator is low
because the proportion of the pollen delivered by the pollinator species is small.
On the other hand, for a specialist plant species, which only has a few pollinator
species, the advantage of excluding an inefficient pollinator is large compared
with a generalist species, as long as the plant receives a sufficient amount of
pollinator visits. Obviously, such processes would promote the differentiation of
generalist and specialist plant species, and, further, may explain why 1-EP
increases with DH2'. It is an open question whether such an evolutionary
framework is responsible for the correlation pattern of DH2' with 1-EA and 1-EP.
Whatever the real cause, however, it suggests that network specialization is key to
understand the negative correlation between 1–EA and 1–EP.” (Pages 13-14, Lines
277-290).
p. 13, l. 22-23: I agree that having specialized pollinators is most important for
plant species that occur at low density. However, that doesn't imply that rare
plants should be more specialized themselves (i.e. have few pollinators).
Moreover, since being specialized on a rare plant is a disadvantageous strategy
from the perspective of a pollinator, I doubt that many rare plants have
specialized flower visitors. As far as I know, many specialized flower visitors,
such as oligolectic bees, visit common plant species that have many other
visitors.
Reply: As above, we agree that our previous discussion was not convincing. We
tried to clarify our ideas how specialization may affect the plant evenness and
rewrote the whole part. It now reads as “On the contrary, the positive correlation
between DH2' and 1-EP may be due to the difference in the advantage generalist
and specialist plant species get from specialization (or exclusion of inefficient

question whether such an evolutionary framework is responsible for the
correlation pattern of DH2' with 1-EA and 1-EP. Whatever the real cause, however,
it suggests that network specialization is key to understand the negative
correlation between 1–EA and 1–EP.” (Pages 13-14, Lines 277-290).
References: The reference section contains a number of formatting errors. In
several cases, the journal name has been truncated (e.g. reference 30:
American Midland Naturalist). Reference 8 (Schleuning et al.) has many more
authors, which should at least be indicated by "et al.".
Reply: Thanks for noting this. We corrected the references. (References 8, 21, 26
and 30).
Fig. 2: What do open and closed circles signify (here and in Fig. 3)? Are all open
circles or all orange circles island networks?
Reply: We unified all symbols to closed circles. Note that in the original
manuscript we used the closed and open circles to indicate communities from the
Northern and Southern hemispheres, respectively, while we missed out the
information in the original figure captions. In the revised manuscript, we decided
not to distinguish between them and changed the figure accordingly, since the plots
do not show clear differences between the two hemispheres nor do we discuss
about the difference in the text (Figures 2, 3 and S3).

Comments on Sakai et al.
Page 3, Line 46 and thereafter: Recommend changing “species of one class” to
“species in one taxonomic category, guild, or trophic level” to avoid confusion
with “class” as a taxonomic ranking.
Reply: Thanks for the comment. We modified the text accordingly. The sentence
reads now “The networks formed by plant–animal mutualisms, such as pollination
and seed dispersal, are typically described as bipartite graphs, in which species in
one taxonomic category, guild or trophic level, e.g., animals, interact with species
in a second category, e.g., plants [3] (figure 1a).” (page 3, line 47, 48).
Page 4, Line 53 (and later): Not entirely clear what you mean by “selective
interactions”? Are you referring to partner choice? Or natural selection? Or
reciprocally specialized interactions at the species level? Please define.
Reply: We agree that the text was not clear. We mean selective interactions
between species in general and changed the text to “Therefore, we evaluated the
degree distributions of the plant and animal sides separately, and tested for
geographical variation. We then explored to what extent the observed patterns are
explained by (i) variation in the degree of specialization and (ii) possible selective
interactions between the species. For this analysis, we used the 28 pollination and
16 seed-dispersal datasets with quantitative measurements.” (page 4, line 72-76).
Page 6, Line 32: Change “It is” to “This is”
Reply: We corrected the text accordingly. (page 6, line 110).
Page 10, Line 8: Change “while” to “whereas”
Reply: We corrected the text accordingly. (page 10, line 193).
Page 10, Line 13: Do you mean, “the magnitude of the relationship”?
Reply: Yes, that’s what we meant. We changed the sentence to “As a result, the
magnitude of the relationship between 1–EP and 1–EA changes among
geographical regions (figure 2a).” (page 10, line 195).
Page 12, Line 13: As before, it’s not entirely clear what you mean by “selective
interactions” in this case.
Reply: We changed the sentence to “Absence of the negative correlations between
1–EP and 1–EA among random pollination networks (electronic supplementary
figure S4) suggests that the negative correlation observed in networks is the result
of selective processes.” (page 12, line 244-245).
Page 13, Line 22: Change “intensify” to “intensifies” and “It” to “this”
Reply: We rewrote the major part of the paragraph (page 13-14, line 277-290)
following a comment by Reviewer 1, so the sentences have been deleted.
Page 15, Line 25: Change “mainlands” to “continents” or “continental regions”
Reply: We changed “mainland” to “continental regions”. (page 15, line 330).
Figure 2a: Although “tropics” is correct English, “boreals” is not (this is a
grammatical irregularity). Change to “Boreal” (similar to “Temperate”).
Reply: We corrected the figure accordingly. (figure 2a).
