The present manuscript reports on bioluminescence imaging experiments in growing colonies of
E.coli bacteria under confinement.
As a key result, the authors have observed the formation of oscillating aggregates (patterns)
which they analyze in detail. In particular, the authors have repeated their experiment with
various mutants and have also performed some mathematical modeling based on the Keller-Segel
equations.
As far as I can see, the results are correct, the conclusions are justified and the manuscript fullfills
the criteria for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Some comments:
- I generally enjoyed reading this manuscript and found the result quite interesting that all
considered mutants form very similar aggregates, i.e. that structure formation in the present
setup is neither based on chemosensory nor on chemotactic signal transduction systems.
- It would be helpful if the authors could relate their experiments and findings better to previous
3
experiments on pattern formation in growing colonies of E.coli bacteria; for example with the
classical experiments by E. Budrene and H. Berg in Nature 349,630 1991 and 376, 49 1995.
- The structure of the manuscript could be somewhat clearer. It is often difficult to see what the
authors are aiming at and only becomes clear in a later paragraph. For example, it would be
helpful if the authors could make it clear from the beginning on, at what they are aiming with the
mathematical model.
As of now, on pages 4 and 5 there is a discussion that bacterial chemotaxis is probably
unimportant for the formation of the observed patterns, which is then directly followed by the
Keller-Segel equation which are normally used to model pattern formation in microorganisms
like Dictyostelium which do sense chemicals.
(That said, content-wise the approach of the authors seems quite sensible to me, since very
similar equations can also be derived for colloids (e.g. in some of the references cited in the
manuscript), but that should be explained more clearly I think.)
- The connection between the present experimental findings and colloidal chemotaxis is
conceptually quite interesting and perhaps the most original part of the present manuscript.
However, I think that it is not clear enough in the manuscript what is meant by 'colloidal
chemotaxis'. In particular, chemotaxis in Janus colloids can refer either to the directed diffusion of
a particle in a chemical concentration gradient, or, to the alignment of these particles with the
gradient.
Perhaps it would help if the authors could introduce both terms, bacterial chemotaxis (based on
the sensation of chemicals) and "colloidal chemotaxis", in their introduction.
- In the introduction: The statement "As bacteria are colloids [1]..may be driven by phoretic but
not flagellar mechanisms" is somewhat confusing. Do the authors mean that bacteria may
experience chemotactic drift effects which move them in addition to their motion by active
swimming?
- The style of the formulas is rather heterogeneous.

Appendix A
Experiments are presented which characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of active suspensions of
E. coli, and the results are considered in the context of a classical mathematical model for
chemotaxis. Various mutant bacteria are considered, with individual genes knocked out associated
with respiration, ion channels, surface appendages, and chemotaxis. There is no systematic
relationship between the patterns observed and the non-chemotactic mutants. However patterns
are slightly supressed (reduced number of aggregations) in suspensions of mutants with certain
genes associated with proton translocation knocked out, and patterns are slightly enhanced when
genes associated with surface appendages are knocked out. A standard linear stability analysis is
performed on a standard chemotaxis model (e.g. as discussed in Murray’s Mathematical Biology
textbook). A comparison is then made between the predictions from the linear stability analysis for
the average number of aggregations and the results from a numerical simulation of the full model
for a range of parameter values (growth rate, chemotactic sensitivity, production & degradation of
the chemoattractant). Up to this point, the paper appears reasonably sound. However the attempts
in section 3.4 to connect the experiments with the model are very weak and the latter half of the
abstract (‘An analysis of the experimental data together with mathematical modelling of pattern
formation suggest the following …’) seems to be wild speculation rather than representative of any
concrete results. I therefore recommend that this paper may be suitable for publication but only
after substantial revision.
Some specific comments/suggestions:
In the experimental conditions considered, have you checked whether the wild-type E coli is actually
motile and whether it does undergo chemotaxis? It would be good to demonstrate that the mutants
do have some of the phenotypic changes associated with the genotype mutation.
Some of the standard linear stability analysis could be moved to an appendix to better elucidate the
key new results presented here.
When comparing the model to the experiments, how does experimental values (e.g. for bacteria
growth rate, either measured independently by the authors or obtained from the literature)
compare with the dimensionless parameters considered in the model. You will need to be more
explicit regarding how the system is non-dimensionalised.
There should be a fuller explanation of how the chemotactic model can be interpreted for a
‘phoretic field’.
Appendix B
Answers to the reviewers
First of all, we thank the reviewers for their useful and in-depth comments on the paper. We believe
that the implemented changes have improved the quality of the paper. Below we give answers to the
reviewers and then provide a list of changes in the paper.
Referee: 1
Up to this point, the paper appears reasonably sound. However the attempts in section 3.4 to connect
the experiments with the model are very weak and the latter half of the abstract (‘An analysis of the
experimental data together with mathematical modelling of pattern formation suggest the following …’)
seems to be wild speculation rather than representative of any concrete results. I therefore recommend
that this paper may be suitable for publication but only after substantial revision.
Answer 1:
We have revised the paper according to the suggestions of the referees. Section 3.4 was substantially
rewritten and divided into three shorter sub-sections in order to emphasize the role of biochemical
oscillators and phoretic interactions in the formation of spatiotemporal patterns. Some of our
suggestions regarding hypothetical processes were omitted. In particular, we omitted the (insufficiently
substantiated) claims about chemo-mechanical oscillators, and the interactions between Min and
oxidative phosphorylation systems of E. coli. We believe that the paper still provides a strong
contribution, despite these omissions.
The latter half of the abstract was corrected:
…An analysis of the experimental data together with mathematical modelling of pattern formation
suggest the following: 1) pattern-forming processes can be described by Keller-Segel-type models of
chemotaxis with logistic cell kinetics; 2) active cells can be seen as biochemical oscillators that exhibit
phoretic drift and alignment; 3) the spatiotemporal patterns in a suspension of growing E. coli form
due to phoretic interactions between oscillating cells of high metabolic activity.
One keyword was changed (‘biochemical oscillations’ substituted of ‘Min oscillations’).
The above modifications were implemented in corrections 1, 2, and 14–22
In the experimental conditions considered, have you checked whether the wild-type E coli is actually
motile and whether it does undergo chemotaxis? It would be good to demonstrate that the mutants do
have some of the phenotypic changes associated with the genotype mutation
Answer 2:
Our microscopic observations indicate that E. coli cells in a drop of the culture just diffuse or swim
slowly (<<20 <U+F06D>m/s). This is consistent with the results of the study by Schwarz-Linek et al. [2016
Escherichia coli as a model active colloid: A practical introduction. Colloid Surf. B-Biointerfaces 137, 2–
16]. These authors pointed out that in the growth medium “only few, if any, of the cells were
swimming”. They also show that the fraction of non-swimmers in specially prepared suspensions of
motile cells is very substantial. (Moreover, the results are dependent on methods, e. g. pipetting
procedure). Unfortunately, the statistical distribution of cells according to their activity in the grow
cultures is still an open problem. In the revised paper we note the complexity of transport of E. coli in
liquid suspensions by citing Schwarz-Linek et al. (correction 5). We agree that the problem raised by
the reviewer is important, yet we believe this should be addressed in future studies that focus
specifically on the distribution of cells according to their activity.
Some of the standard linear stability analysis could be moved to an appendix to better elucidate the
key new results presented here
1
Answer 3:
The standard linear stability analysis was moved to the Appendix A (corrections 11 and 23).
When comparing the model to the experiments, how does experimental values (e.g. for bacteria
growth rate, either measured independently by the authors or obtained from the literature) compare
with the dimensionless parameters considered in the model. You will need to be more explicit
regarding how the system is non-dimensionalised.
Answer 4:
The sub-section “Pattern forming parameters” was added to the text. The values of the dimensionless
parameters of the model were determined experimentally by changing input parameters and aiming to
achieve an irregular wave pattern comparable to the one observed experimentally. Taking into account
the transformation of variables, the dimensional parameters were determined.
The values of the dimensional parameters (diffusion coefficients, grow rates) were compared with
those obtained by other authors (3 additional papers were cited). It was found that the grow rate of
active cell in our model is very high. This is explained by temporal changes of cell activity (biochemical
oscillations of cells).
The above modifications were implemented in corrections 11, 12, 18, 22 and 24.
There should be a fuller explanation of how the chemotactic model can be interpreted for a ‘phoretic
field’.
Answer 5:
We have provided a fuller explanation (using corrections 4, 10, 16 and 25). In particular, we explain
the chemotactic motion of a phoretic particle as its phoretic drift and alignment due to coupling with
the ‘phoretic field’ that is generated by all other colloids. We consider that a phoretic field is an
effective chemical field whose gradient induces phoretic migration of cells. The Keller-Segel equations
can be used to model pattern formation in bacterial populations. However, similar equations can also
be derived for chemotactic colloids. In our study the mathematical modelling of pattern-forming
processes is provided, keeping in mind that active cells may behave as chemotactic colloids that couple
with the ‘phoretic field’.
Referee: 2
It would be helpful if the authors could relate their experiments and findings better to previous
experiments on pattern formation in growing colonies of E.coli bacteria; for example with the classical
experiments by E. Budrene and H. Berg in Nature 349,630 1991 and 376, 49 1995.
Answer 6:
We now cite these classical papers in the introduction (corrections 3, 24) and then note that that the
pattern-forming mechanisms in liquid medium and in agar plates are different (correction 22). Our
study shows that metabolically active bacteria in a liquid medium behave as biochemical oscillators and
exhibit chemotaxis of the similar origin as synthetic Janus particles.
The structure of the manuscript could be somewhat clearer. It is often difficult to see what the authors
are aiming at and only becomes clear in a later paragraph. For example, it would be helpful if the
authors could make it clear from the beginning on, at what they are aiming with the mathematical
model. As of now, on pages 4 and 5 there is a discussion that bacterial chemotaxis is probably
unimportant for the formation of the observed patterns, which is then directly followed by the Keller-
2
Segel equation which are normally used to model pattern formation in microorganisms like
Dictyostelium which do sense chemicals. (That said, content-wise the approach of the authors seems
quite sensible to me, since very similar equations can also be derived for colloids (e.g. in some of the
references cited in the manuscript), but that should be explained more clearly I think.)
Answer 7:
The structure of the paper was clarified according to the kind suggestions of the referee.
The modifications were implemented in corrections 4, 9, 10, 14-22 and 24.
The connection between the present experimental findings and colloidal chemotaxis is conceptually
quite interesting and perhaps the most original part of the present manuscript. However, I think that it
is not clear enough in the manuscript what is meant by 'colloidal chemotaxis'. In particular, chemotaxis
in Janus colloids can refer either to the directed diffusion of a particle in a chemical concentration
gradient, or, to the alignment of these particles with the gradient. Perhaps it would help if the authors
could introduce both terms, bacterial chemotaxis (based on the sensation of chemicals) and "colloidal
chemotaxis", in their introduction.
Answer 8:
The meaning of ‘colloidal’ chemotaxis is explained in the introduction of the revised version of the
paper. We consider that ‘colloidal’ chemotaxis is a phoretic drift and alignment of the colloidal particles
(‘chemotactic colloids’ [Saha S, Golestanian R, Ramaswamy S. 2014 Clusters, asters, and collective
oscillations in chemotactic colloids. Phys. Rev. E 89, 062316]). Both terms (‘colloidal’ chemotaxis or
chemotactic colloids) are not widely accepted. Therefore, in certain cases we use instead phrases like
‘phoretic drift and alignment’.
The above modifications were implemented in corrections 4, 8, 9, 16 and 25.
In the introduction: The statement "As bacteria are colloids [1]..may be driven by phoretic but not
flagellar mechanisms" is somewhat confusing. Do the authors mean that bacteria may experience
chemotactic drift effects which move them in addition to their motion by active swimming?
Answer 9:
The unclear sentence was deleted. Two sentences were added (correction 5).
The style of the formulas is rather heterogeneous.
Answer 10:
The modelling section was improved according to the suggestions. The standard linear stability
analysis was moved to an Appendix A
(corrections 11 and 23).

transformation of variables [22, 25], one can determine the
values of the dimensional parameters. Assuming that the
length l* = 22 mm of the three-phase contact line and the
duration T* = 4 h = 1.44 <U+F0B4> 104 s of the physical experiment to
be simulated correspond to the dimensionless length (l =
2<U+F070>r, where r = 2.5 is the plate radius) and the duration (T =
400) used in the pattern simulation, we calculate the
dimensional diffusion coefficient of the chemoattractant (Dc
= (l*/l)2 <U+F0B4> (T/T*) <U+F0BB> 5.5 <U+F0B4> 10-2 mm2/s) and of the cells (Dn =
0.1 Dc <U+F0BB> 5.5 <U+F0B4> 10-3 mm2/s). This value of the diffusion
coefficient Dn of E. coli cells is greater than that (2–4 <U+F0B4>10–4
mm2/s) determined by Berg and Turner [47]. However, it
rather well fits with the estimates made by Perry (2.2 <U+F0B4> 10–3
mm2/s) [48] and by Lin et al. (7 <U+F0B4> 10–3 mm2/s) [49]. The
dimensional cell growth rate in our model equals <U+F061>(T/T*) <U+F0BB>
0.028 s-1, which also means that the cell division period
equals ln(2)/0.028 <U+F0BB> 25 s. This value of the cell division
period is discussed below.

15 3.4.1 Chemotaxis and phoretic interactions
16 ...The chemotactic motion of the phoretic particle can be
seen as its phoretic drift and alignment due to coupling with
the ‘phoretic field’ which is generated by all other colloids
[19]. We consider that phoretic field is an effective chemical
field whose gradient induces phoretic migration of cells….
17 3.4.2 Growth and oscillations
6
18 As was shown above, the dimensional cell growth rate in our
model equals 0.028 s-1. At first glance this result appears to
be unexpected, since the rate of bacterial growth is of the
order of h-1 [3, 6, 7]. In the previous studies we interpreted
similar results by assuming temporal changes of cell
behaviour due to their metabolic flexibility [21, 23, 24]. It is
known that the intracellular oscillations may emerge in a
living cell [30]. Despite the fact that the details of oscillatory
processes, which determine the growth rate in our model, are
unknown, we hypothesize that some active pole-to-pole
oscillators may be involved.
19 ….This speculative assumption should be validated in future
studies.
20 3.4.3. Phoretic interactions between biochemical
oscillators
21 In summary, the formation of spatiotemporal patterns in a
growing culture can be explained by phoretic interactions in
population of biochemical oscillators. In order to
characterize the relevant dynamic processes let’s return to
the equation (11).
22 Consequently, when a = 0.028 s-1, we have <U+F074>phor = 360 s;
<U+F074>swim = 36 s; <U+F074>form=18 s. These estimates indicate that phoretic
interactions between short-period (~0.5 min) biochemical
oscillators in the growing culture of E. coli should be
accompanied by the collective chemical oscillations (grow
and decay of the phoretic field) with period of about 6
minutes. These results show that the pattern-forming
mechanisms in liquid medium and in agar plates [6, 7] are
different. Although, in both cases the key processes are
chemotaxis and growth, yet the origins and time-scales of
these processes are different.
