1. In line 56: the authors stated that “Although not detected, some CuO phase may exist as
nanostructured or amorphous state.” There is no experimental indication of this statement. The
authors should confirm this statement experimentally.
2. There is no stability work for CeO2-CuO system in the manuscript. It is known that although
the presence of CuO besides CeO2 enhances the OSC values compared to CeO2-ZrO2 or CeO2-
TiO2, the thermal stability of the CuO-containing samples is quite low. The authors should
discuss this in their manuscript.
3. The total OSC of CeO2-CuO system is not directly related to the structural oxygen defects
present in CeO2 system. It is also related to the high reducibility of the CuO phase. If the authors
calculated theoretical the OSC values, they would also realize this effect.
4. The authors did not use XPS and Raman Spec in the study to show the effect of mechanical
milling on the density of structural oxygen defects in metal oxide particle system. The results
obtained from the mentioned experimental methods will shed light on the enhanced OSC
property and improve the author’s results.
5. Some of the beneficial references are missing in the manuscript. The following papers can be

should be cited in the manuscript.

Reviewer's comments to article:
"Structure and catalytic behavior of CuO-CeO2 prepared by High-
Energy Ball Milling"
This is an interesting article focusing on the preparation of CuO-CeO2
catalytic materials which are of important in the fabrication of The three way
catalysts (TWCs). The CuO-CeO2 composite powders were prepared at
different ration of CuO to CeO2 and different high energy ball milling time.
The fabrication and testing methods are highly reliability. The results of this
research show higher potential of total oxygen storage capacity of CuO-CeO2
composites in comparison to traditional CeO2-ZrO2 materials.
I suggest that this article is suitable to publish in the Journal of Royal
Society Open Science after the minor revisions as following:
1. There are several English mistakes through the article. The authors
should take a proofreading.
2. Fig. 1 and Fig. 9 need to be edited to for clear reading: the axis titles
and tick labels were overlapped
3. There are several mistakes in reference section that need to be
corrected following the format of the journal and also, for citation
through the text in the article.
Appendix B
Dear Editors
Thank you very much for your considerate email and sending the invaluable
comments that the reviewers proposed on our paper which could be
publishing in the Journal of Royal Society Open Science, entitled “Structure
and catalytic behavior of CuO-CeO2 prepared by High-Energy Ball Milling”.
In our opinion, all the suggestions made by the referees would improve the
manuscript, and we have carefully followed their indications. Our point-by-
point answers are as follows:
Comments from the reviewer 1 and our response:

We revised carefully our manuscript, thank you for your comment
2. Fig. 1 and Fig. 9 need to be edited to for clear reading: the axis titles
and tick labels were overlapped 3. There are several mistakes in reference
section that need to be corrected following the format of the journal and
also, for citation through the text in the article.
Figure 1 and Figure 2 were revised to make them more clearly; the
mistakes in reference section were corrected, thank you.
Comments from the reviewer 2 and our response:
1. In line 56: the authors stated that “Although not detected, some CuO
phase may exist as nanostructured or amorphous state.” There is no
experimental indication of this statement. The authors should confirm this
statement experimentally.
Thank you for your comment, based on our experience about ball milling and
referred some papers, it could appear nanostructured or amorphous state due
to the milling ex. E. R. Leite, L. P. S. Santos, N. L. V. Carreno, and E. Longo,
Appl. Phys. Lett. 78, 2148 (2001), C.C.Koch, Nanostructured Materials,
Volume 9, Issues 1–8, 1997, Pages 13-22, so in this paper we suggested this
state .
2. There is no stability work for CeO2-CuO system in the manuscript. It is
known that although the presence of CuO besides CeO2 enhances the OSC
values compared to CeO2-ZrO2 or CeO2-TiO2, the thermal stability of the
CuO-containing samples is quite low. The authors should discuss this in
their manuscript.
This manuscript, we focus on the new method to prepare mixed CeO2-CuO
by high-energy mechanical milling, the reduction of CuO was observed when
milling was processed in air, the thermal stability of the CuO was also
discussed on Fig.8. Thank you.
3. The total OSC of CeO2-CuO system is not directly related to the structural
oxygen defects present in CeO2 system. It is also related to the high
reducibility of the CuO phase. If the authors calculated theoretical the
OSC values, they would also realize this effect.
In this study, The total OSC improved which was relative the change
crystallite structure of CuO and CeO2 due to the milling, beside that it is also
related to the high reducibility of the CuO phase. We will calculate and
compare total OSC of CeO2-CuO system which prepares ball milling with
other method ex sol-gel in other paper. Thank you for your comments.
4. The authors did not use XPS and Raman Spec in the study to show the
effect of mechanical milling on the density of structural oxygen defects in
metal oxide particle system. The results obtained from the mentioned
experimental methods will shed light on the enhanced OSC property and
improve the author’s results.
Thank you for your comments. We tried using XPS to observe the effect of
mechanical milling on structural oxygen defects in metal oxide particle system
(the XPS results will be attached in this revised manuscript). However, it
showed that, the state of CuO is not stability, the CuO is oxidized easily due
to samples treatment, the reason that crystallite structure of CuO was changed
due to the milling, so it is difficult to use this method for calculation structural
oxygen defects.
5. Some of the beneficial references are missing in the manuscript. The
following papers can be used to improve the statements and address some
of the concerns listed above. Therefore, they should be cited in the
manuscript.

Ti, Cu) mixed metal oxides with enhanced oxygen storage capacity,

core/shell nanoparticles with high oxygen storage capacity; International
Nano Letters, 2017, 7:187-193.
The references are now formatted. Thank you.
We believe that the revised paper includes all the important comments and
corrections, which would, we hope, suffice the publication standard of the
Royal Society Open Science Journal.
