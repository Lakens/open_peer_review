The manuscript by Trott et al. presents an integrative mechanistic model describing the motility
of cytoplasmic dynein. The model integrates the temporal dynamics of all dynein components
(cargo, tail, AAA+ rings, and MTBDs) as the motor walks to test the effect of inter-head
coordination on the stepping properties of dynein by comparing the numerical simulations to the
experimental observations. The derived formula is then further modelled to take into account the
backward stepping and the variable step size and dwelling. The model suggests that stochastic
stepping with limited coordination between the motor domains (probability of stepping is
independent of which head stepped previously) cannot replicate the experimental observations
of the frequency of alternating steps, indicating a higher level of coordination between the two
heads (probability of stepping is higher in the trailing head). Further relaxing the model to
assume that the two motor domains step independently (both heads can bind ATP and detach at
the same time) also cannot replicate the experimentally observed stepping profile, and in
addition the simulated run lengths were significantly lower measured values due to premature
termination, suggesting that coordination also is important to achieve high run lengths.
Extending the model framework to account for backward stepping, variable step sizes and large
scale dwelling of dynein shows that the likelihood of backward steps is directly related to the
separation distance between the two heads, and the same applies to the frequency of passing
steps as it decreases when the separation distance increases. The same model suggests that 10% of
the MTBDs steps are of a zero-step size (motor detaches and binds at the same position on the
microtubule), which cannot be determined by the step finding algorithms used in analysis of the
experimental data.
The study extends our understanding of the level of coordination between the head domains of
dynein to achieve processive unidirectional runs that reproduce the experimental observations.
The reported observations on the MTBDs standing relative to each other and relative to the head
domains provide useful information on the stepping properties of dynein because tagging this
region can be technically challenging for in vitro experiments.
Overall, the study is technically sound and is expected to advance the scientific knowledge of
molecular motors. The manuscript is clearly written. I am listing major and minor concerns that
need to be addressed before I recommend publication.
Major Points
Most critically, the authors should read the dynein literature more carefully and precisely reflect
where the field currently stands in the main text. For that, I strongly recommend the authors to
discuss their model in detail with a dynein biophysicist or a structural biologist before revising
the manuscript. There are many examples in text the authors discuss studies that are now
obsolete based on more recent findings and fully neglect some the findings crucial for modeling
dynein stepping mechanism. I will give a few examples below, but this list is not comprehensive.
Abstract: “…it reflects recent experimental observations that dynein walks on microtubules using
a handover-hand processive motion and through shuffling.” This sentence can be misleading to
the reader. Hand over hand is used to describe strictly alternating stepping pattern of the heads
and that heads passing each other after every step on a single protofilament. Shuffling is used to
describe a situation in which the heads move side by side by taking alternating steps. In the case
of dynein, the heads are only weakly coordinated and the stepping of the two heads are largely
independent of each other. I recommend the authors to revise this sentence to better reflect where
the field stands.
In Figure 2, that stalks are shown as identical springs pointing towards each other. However,
structural studies showed that both stalk are tilted towards the plus end and more or less in
3
parallel orientation to each other (rather than pointing towards each other). This needs to be
fixed. Imai et al. Nat Comm have more detailed experimental data about how the stalk angles
change with respect to the distance between the AAA rings and this information can be useful to
improve the model.
I was surprised to see that the authors do not mention Cleary et al. Nat Comm. 2014 study at all.
This study showed how interhead separation induces partial coordination in the stepping
mechanism. This is done through an intramolecular tension of the linker domain which gates
ATP induced stepping of the heads. I think this study, along with Qiu et al. and Dewitt et al., is
the most relevant work to the model presented in this manuscript. The authors should discuss if
they agree or disagree with this study. For example, page 33 line 12-13: “We note that by allowing
the head domains to step independently, they are able to diverge considerably which may not be
biologically realistic”. Cleary et al already showed why this is not the case.
The authors mainly compare their percentage of passing/not passing and alternating/non-
alternating steps with Qiu et al., yet they take the maximum interhead separation (48 nm) from
Dewitt et al. 48 nm separation was not seen by Qiu et al. I suggest the authors compare their
findings to both studies in detail rather than choosing parameters from one study and comparing
the results to the other.
Page 33, lines 37-47: The reason why murine dynein has a short run length in the absence of
dynactin is not related to dynactin dependent coordination of dynein stepping. Torisawa et al
NCB, Zhang et al Cell and many others showed that dynein from higher organisms than yeast
favors an autoinhibited conformation on its own. Forming a ternary complex with dynactin and a
cargo adaptor activates processive motility. Similarly, Loa dynein was not processive because the
protein autoinhibits itself without its cofactors. All of the prior in vitro work on mammalian
dynein prior to McKenney Science 2014 and Schlager EMBO Reports 2014 used
inactive/autoinhibited or partially inactive complexes. Therefore, their findings cannot explain
how dynein works when it is in its active form.
The authors argue that interhead coordination is required for observed long run lengths of
dynein. Without knowing the duty ratio of the motor, or how fast a head steps and rebinds
microtubule, it is impossible to make correct statements on this.
Minor points:
The authors derive two parameters (<U+03B3>ATP and KATP) that determine the size of the ATP force
produced by the modelled dashpot on unbound MTBD upon ATP binding. It is unclear how they
estimated the values of these two parameters in table 1, and how changing of these two numbers
could translate to significant increases in the observed number of steps and run lengths (tables 5
and 6).
Based on stochastic stepping with limited coordination, the authors simulated traces for the
positions of several dynein components. In figure 4b, the presented trace of cargo does not show
a stepping pattern while the tail, rings, and MTBDs all show a stepping behavior (figure 4c,d,e,f).
There are no external forces acting on the cargo and I was expecting to see a similar stepping
profile at the cargo, especially the numerical solutions for independent stepping assumption
shows a clear stepping pattern for the cargo similar to the tail region (figure 9a, b).
The authors should provide an explanation of why the cargo velocity increases over time before
reaching a plateau (figure 5a).
The authors observed differences in the stepping behavior of the two rings compared to the
MTBDs with rings are positioned further apart from each other and crossing paths at different
time points (figure 11 e, f). I would encourage them to provide further details on how the MTBDs
positioning vary over time relative to the head and if the frequency of not passing and alternating
steps differs between them.

Review of the article
"A mathematical understanding of how cytoplasmic dynein walks on microtubules"
by
L. Trott, M. Hafezparast, and A. Madzvamuse
This paper deals with the migration of the cytoplasmic protein dynein along the microtubules.
The authors propose a one-dimensional mechanical model that addresses the evolution in time of
the positions of several of the protein components: cargo, the tail domain, the AAA+ rings, and
the microtubules binding domains (MTBDs).
The derivation of the model results from force balance principles. After a series of assumptions
and simplifications the authors propose the main formulation (4.20)-(4.25). In the continuation of
the paper, the authors discuss variants of this model, simulate them, and compare the results
with experimental data.
Overall, it is a nicely written work that is worth publishing in RSOS. I have though a number of
remarks that would like to see them addressed before publication.
Point 1) Comparison with the previous work [29] of some of the authors.
Point 2) Page 5, last point: While you state "There are no external forces ... trap", in page 6 line 25
you state "For the cargo there is a spring ... on it". Rephrase to avoid the ambiguity.
Point 3) Page 6 line 23: A more extensive discussion of the expected differences between the 1-
and the 2- dimensional versions of the model and the biological reality.
Point 4) Page 8, Remark 4.2: You refer to 2-dimensional stepping implying that the protein will
be walking along the surface of the microtubule? You should discuss that slightly more.
5
Point 5) Page 9: The explanation of the synchronization between the two heads in the paragraph
before (4.14) should be more clear.
Point 6) Page 9: Remark 4.3: Reformulate "...in Section (d) and in Section (d)..."
Point 7) Page 9, Remark 4.4: Clearly this works for discrete steps. How does the model
incorporate the continuity of time?
Point 8) Page 10, Nondimensionalization: Do you mean that the coefficient of the acceleration
terms, as they emerge from the dimensional analysis, are small and hence neglected, or do you
make additional assumptions on their magnitude?
Point 9) Page 11: Independent stepping: "It has been suggested..." Do you mean previously in the
literature? This sentence implies that some discussion took place for which the reader of this
paper is unaware of.
Point 10) Page 12: Replace the small letter \tau by the capital in the interval [0, \tau_\text{Final}]
Point 11) Page 12: You refer to the ode45 solver of MATLAB. It would be advisable to briefly
mention the underlying numerical method that this solver incorporates. This will increase the
numerical value of the paper and allow for non-MATLAB users to reproduce your experiments
with greater ease. Same remark holds for the solver ode15s that appears later in the manuscript.
Also take care and refer to MATLAB with all capital letters.
Point 12) Page 17, Remark 5.4: It is not clear what the meaning of the "with an average of ... 20%"
is. Please reformulate. Also give a conclusion to this Remark, i.e. is the fact "This is just under..."
good or bad for the model?
Point 13) Page 19, line 16: It seems that the citation [42] refers to the particular dwelling model
instead of MATLAB.
Point 14) Page 20, line 33: What do you mean by "external to the model"? Are there more
processes that affect the mathematical model without being addressed in the paper?
Point 15) Page 13, Figure 4: What do you mean by "trajectory" for the cargo and the rest of the
components? Is it distance/position? The model (4.20)-(4.25) that you solve is 1 dimensional after
all.
Point 16) Page 13, Figure 4: Have you verified that the acceleration that the cargo velocity (sub-
)figure implies, is small enough to be neglected in (4.20)-(4.25)? For later times, as Figure 5
exhibits, the cargo reaches "constant" velocity.
Point 17) Page 20 line 50: "stepping probability ... has stepped" isn't this the definition of $P_D$?
The reader has done some effort to accept to the notation and it is better to use it.
Point 18) Page 23 line 16: E. Campillo-Funollet is not a sole author in [45].
Point 19) Page 23 line 19: Reformulate the sentence "For such a framework ... data". Refrain from
suggesting other scientists to "... measure some of the processes ..." via the manuscript.

readability. It is pleasing to note that both reviewers recommend that the study
suitable for RSOS readership, and that the work extends our understanding of the
el of coordination between the head domains to achieve processive unidirectional
ns that reproduce experimental observations. Below we detail our responses to re-
wers’ comments. In the revised manuscripts, new material is highlighted in blue to

1. The manuscript by Trott et al. presents an integrative mechanistic model describ-
ing the motility of cytoplasmic dynein. The model integrates the temporal dynam-
ics of all dynein components (cargo, tail, AAA+ rings, and MTBDs) as the mo-
tor walks to test the effect of inter-head coordination on the stepping properties of
dynein by comparing the numerical simulations to the experimental observations.
The derived formula is then further modelled to take into account the backward
stepping and the variable step size and dwelling. The model suggests that stochas-
tic stepping with limited coordination between the motor domains (probability of
stepping is independent of which head stepped previously) cannot replicate the ex-
perimental observations of the frequency of alternating steps, indicating a higher
level of coordination between the two heads (probability of stepping is higher in
the trailing head). Further relaxing the model to assume that the two motor do-
mains step independently (both heads can bind ATP and detach at the same time)
also cannot replicate the experimentally observed stepping profile, and in addition
the simulated run lengths were significantly lower measured values due to prema-
ture termination, suggesting that coordination also is important to achieve high
run lengths. Extending the model framework to account for backward stepping,
variable step sizes and large scale dwelling of dynein shows that the likelihood of
backward steps is directly related to the separation distance between the two heads,
and the same applies to the frequency of passing steps as it decreases when the
separation distance increases. The same model suggests that 10% of the MTBDs
steps are of a zero-step size (motor detaches and binds at the same position on
the microtubule), which cannot be determined by the step finding algorithms used
in analysis of the experimental data. The study extends our understanding of the
level of coordination between the head domains of dynein to achieve processive
unidirectional runs that reproduce the experimental observations. The reported
observations on the MTBDs standing relative to each other and relative to the
head domains provide useful information on the stepping properties of dynein be-
cause tagging this region can be technically challenging for in vitro experiments.
Overall, the study is technically sound and is expected to advance the scientific
knowledge of molecular motors. The manuscript is clearly written. I am listing
major and minor concerns that need to be addressed before I recommend publica-
tion.
Response: We thank the reviewer for these positive comments about the
novelty and the impact of our manuscript in advancing scientific knowledge in
2
molecular motors. Below we address the major and minor comments raised.
2. Most critically, the authors should read the dynein literature more carefully and
precisely reflect where the field currently stands in the main text. For that, I
strongly recommend the authors to discuss their model in detail with a dynein
biophysicist or a structural biologist before revising the manuscript. There are
many examples in text the authors discuss studies that are now obsolete based
on more recent findings and fully neglect some the findings crucial for modeling
dynein stepping mechanism. I will give a few examples below, but this list is not
comprehensive.
Response: We thank the reviewer for these important suggestions. The area
of cytoplasmic dynein is constantly evolving with hundreds of papers published
annually. Within this context, we have carried out a detailed literature review to
identify, to the best of our knowledge, the most appropriate references that reflect
where the field currently stands. As a result, we have substantially re-written the
introduction and motivation as well as the discussion, both from experimental and
modelling points of view. We fully agree with the reviewer that engaging with a
dynein biophysicist or a structural biologist would be beneficial, we think the best
scenario would be if there is detailed space-time series data for a specific type of
dynein to which the solution of the mathematical model can be best-fit to the
data in order to determine fully the parameter values within an inverse problem
framework. The idea would be to find optimal parameters as distributions by say,
using the Bayesian approach (see Campillo-Funollet, E. et al., (2016), for further
details) we have developed in our research group, given quantitative measure-
ments (raw data) in the form of space-time series. This approach will then allow
us and the experimentalist(s) to carry out detailed sensitivity analysis, statistical
classification and identification of key parameters with the ultimate goal of mak-
ing model predictions that could then be tested experimentally. This approach
is the focus of our current studies and we thank the reviewer for confirming our
long term research ambition.
3. Abstract: ” · · · it reflects recent experimental observations that dynein walks on
microtubules using a handover-hand processive motion and through shuffling.”
This sentence can be misleading to the reader. Hand over hand is used to de-
scribe strictly alternating stepping pattern of the heads and that heads passing
each other after every step on a single protofilament. Shuffling is used to describe
a situation in which the heads move side by side by taking alternating steps. In
the case of dynein, the heads are only weakly coordinated and the stepping of the
two heads are largely independent of each other. I recommend the authors to re-
vise this sentence to better reflect where the field stands.

Response: We again thank the reviewer for this insightful critique. The
reviewer is absolutely correct. Instead of using hand-over-hand and shuffling,
we have restricted ourselves to specific stepping patterns that can be categorised
as alternating, non-alternating, passing and not-passing given the fact that our
model is strictly one-dimensional. These terms reflect more appropriately the
physical stepping patterns in 1-D. Hand-over-hand and shuffling have been shown
to be more associated with kinesin and myosin stepping patterning rather than
with dynein. It will be interesting to see what type of stepping patterns emerge
for the case of two- and three-dimensional models, where the heads have more
freedom to step on and off the microtubule surface. However, such a study is
beyond the scope of this manuscript.
4. In Figure 2, that stalks are shown as identical springs pointing towards each other.
However, structural studies showed that both stalk are tilted towards the plus end
and more or less in parallel orientation to each other (rather than pointing to-
wards each other). This needs to be fixed. Imai et al. Nat Comm have more
detailed experimental data about how the stalk angles change with respect to the
distance between the AAA rings and this information can be useful to improve the
model.
Response: The reviewer is absolutely spot on. We have developed a general
model that allows for both scenarios to be taken into account and we argue that
during the stepping process, stalks assume different geometrical configurations
and yet the underlying stepping behavior remains unchanged. To demonstrate
this observation, we have included in the Supplementary Material (i) the new
model if one was to assume that the stalks are tilted towards the plus end and lie
more or less in parallel orientation to each other and (ii) presented a snap shot
of some of the numerical results illustrating the stepping patterns with identical
model parameter values to those of the model when the stalks are more or less
in a vertical position and pointing towards each other. The conclusions drawn
from both models and simulations are identical. As a result, we have inserted
appropriate text on page 7 of the new manuscript explaining the model framework
and how it relates to the structural design reported in experimental papers.
5. I was surprised to see that the authors do not mention Cleary et al. Nat Comm.
2014 study at all. This study showed how interhead separation induces partial
coordination in the stepping mechanism. This is done through an intramolecular
tension of the linker domain which gates ATP induced stepping of the heads. I
think this study, along with Qiu et al. and Dewitt et al., is the most relevant work
4
to the model presented in this manuscript. The authors should discuss if they
agree or disagree with this study. For example, page 33 line 12-13: ”We note
that by allowing the head domains to step independently, they are able to diverge
considerably which may not be biologically realistic”. Cleary et al already showed
why this is not the case.
Response: We are grateful to the reviewer for this valuable comment. We
are aware of the work by Cleary et al., but we thought it might not be ap-
propriate since we are not modelling explicitly the linker and its role in gating
ATP-dependent release of dynein from the microtubule. However, it is clear to us
now, that the linker could actually be a critical component to include in a future
model whereby retraction of the leading head or pulling of the lagging head at
larger interhead separation distances might help counter balance the continuous
divergence of the interheads without such a linker. Throughout the manuscript we
have added appropriate text to explain possible remedies to deal with diverging
heads.
6. The authors mainly compare their percentage of passing/not passing and alternating/non-
alternating steps with Qiu et al., yet they take the maximum interhead separation
(48 nm) from Dewitt et al. 48 nm separation was not seen by Qiu et al. I suggest
the authors compare their findings to both studies in detail rather than choosing
parameters from one study and comparing the results to the other.
Response: We agree fully with the reviewer’s comment. In all our simulations
(unless stated otherwise), we have taken the maximum interhead separation dis-
tance to be 48nm. This choice was based on the fact that we explored a wide
range of values for the maximum separation distance as shown in Tables 3 and
7, and an optimal value of 48nm was chosen. It must be noted that data from
DeWitt et al., showed head separation distances of the range 23 ± 13.2 nm, not
48nm. It was not our intention to choose data from one paper to validate results
from another but that we found some optimal parameters that gave rise to the
mathematical predictions outlined. This again, brings us to the point that in or-
der to make a full parameter identification such that the model best-fits to data,
we need quantitative space-time distributions of the stepping profiles.
7. Page 33, lines 37-47: The reason why murine dynein has a short run length in the
absence of dynactin is not related to dynactin dependent coordination of dynein
stepping. Torisawa et al NCB, Zhang et al Cell and many others showed that
dynein from higher organisms than yeast favors an autoinhibited conformation on
its own. Forming a ternary complex with dynactin and a cargo adaptor activates
5
processive motility. Similarly, Loa dynein was not processive because the protein
autoinhibits itself without its cofactors. All of the prior in vitro work on mam-
malian dynein prior to McKenney Science 2014 and Schlager EMBO Reports
2014 used inactive/autoinhibited or partially inactive complexes. Therefore, their
findings cannot explain how dynein works when it is in its active form.
Response: The reason why the mean run lengths are lower than those seen in
experiments could be due the regulatory functions of dynactin and other cargo
adaptor proteins such as BICD2 present in vivo, which activate long distance
movement of the motor [see Zhang et al, Cell, 2017, Torisawa et al. NCB, 2014].
Further modelling in this direction might help to confirm or refute such a hypoth-
esis. We have added appropriate text in the manuscript along these lines.
8. The authors argue that interhead coordination is required for observed long run
lengths of dynein. Without knowing the duty ratio of the motor, or how fast a
head steps and rebinds microtubule, it is impossible to make correct statements
on this.
Response: We agree fully with the reviewer. To this end, we have rephrased
our statements to reflect the need for knowing the duty ratio of the motor as well
as data on how fast the head steps and rebinds on microtubules.
9. The authors derive two parameters (<U+03B3>AT P and KAT P ) that determine the size of
the ATP force produced by the modelled dashpot on unbound MTBD upon ATP
binding. It is unclear how they estimated the values of these two parameters in
table 1, and how changing of these two numbers could translate to significant in-
creases in the observed number of steps and run lengths (tables 5 and 6).
Response: The two parameters <U+03B3>AT P and KAT P are estimated by trial error
(hence the need for a rigorous parameter identification approach). We have in-
cluded a statement of this nature in the heading (see Table 1 caption). Indeed
these two parameters play a key role in the number of steps and lengths as shown
in Tables 5 and 6. It must be noted that these two parameter determine how
fast the head steps and rebinds to the MT (related to the reviewer’s previous
comment above) so that is how they would relate to the number of steps and run
lengths. i.e. if the head does not step fast enough, the other one steps and so
the complex falls off. In order to rigorously quantify the statistical significance of
these and other parameters, sensitivity analysis of the model parameters would
be beneficial but for this, space-time series data will be essential.

0. Based on stochastic stepping with limited coordination, the authors simulated
traces for the positions of several dynein components. In figure 4b, the presented
trace of cargo does not show a stepping pattern while the tail, rings, and MTBDs
all show a stepping behavior (figure 4c,d,e,f ). There are no external forces acting
on the cargo and I was expecting to see a similar stepping profile at the cargo,
especially the numerical solutions for independent stepping assumption shows a
clear stepping pattern for the cargo similar to the tail region (figure 9a, b).
Response: Although the locus of the cargo does not seem to show a stepping
pattern, zooming in will show however that this is not the case and that the
cargo does indeed step. The amplitude of the steps are not so pronounced. When
dwelling is included in the modelling, the cargo exhibits large amplitudes of the
same magnitudes as those of the other units and therefore the stepping patterns
are well pronounced. We have included appropriate text to highlight this point
to the reader.
1. The authors should provide an explanation of why the cargo velocity increases
over time before reaching a plateau (figure 5a).
Response: The temporal dynamics of the cargo start with zero velocity since
the cargo is at rest. Given that there are no external forces, the cargo has to be
pick up speed once dynein starts to move along the microtubule but this speed
does not continue to increase, instead it reaches a plateau where the profile of the
velocity is oscillatory. This is in synch with the stepping patterns of the domains.
2. The authors observed differences in the stepping behavior of the two rings com-
pared to the MTBDs with rings are positioned further apart from each other and
crossing paths at different time points (figure 11 e, f ). I would encourage them to
provide further details on how the MTBDs positioning vary over time relative to
the head and if the frequency of not passing and alternating steps differs between
them.
Response: Our computational results show that the frequency of alternating
steps did not differ (an emergent process of the modelling). On the other hand,
our results show that the not-passing steps differed by approximately 1-4% for
optimal parameters, which is not such a big variation. However, this variation
was significant for small values of the maximum separation distance (see Supple-
mentary Material for details). We provided further explanation in the manuscript
to highlight these differences.

1. This paper deals with the migration of the cytoplasmic protein dynein along the
microtubules. The authors propose a one-dimensional mechanical model that ad-
dresses the evolution in time of the positions of several of the protein components:
cargo, the tail domain, the AAA+ rings, and the microtubules binding domains
(MTBDs). The derivation of the model results from force balance principles.
After a series of assumptions and simplifications the authors propose the main
formulation (4.20)-(4.25). In the continuation of the paper, the authors discuss
variants of this model, simulate them, and compare the results with experimental
data. Overall, it is a nicely written work that is worth publishing in RSOS. I
have though a number of remarks that would like to see them addressed before
publication.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the positive comments about the quality
of the manuscript and that it is appropriate for publication in the RSOS journal.
Below we address the remarks raised by the reviewer.
2. Point 1) Comparison with the previous work [29] of some of the authors.
Response: Thank you. We have included some remarks detailing the compar-
ison between this work and that previously published by Crossley et al., (2012).
Unlike this current work, the previous study was devoid of any statistical analy-
sis which forms the bulk of the current model. The main key differences are the
stochastic multiscale modelling, the use of continuous functions to model bind-
ing and ATP force, and the introduction of the tail component. Furthermore,
we modelled for the first time variable stepping, including heads being able to
move independently, not in a strictly coordinated pattern. Other processes such
as variable steps, backward stepping, dwelling times, etc. were not modelled in
the previous study. Comparison with previous work has been detailed in the
appropriate section of the manuscript.
3. Point 2) Page 5, last point: While you state ”There are no external forces ...
trap”, in page 6 line 25 you state ”For the cargo there is a spring ... on it”.
Rephrase to avoid the ambiguity.
Response: We have rephrased this statement by precisely stating what we do
not model as part of the cargo.
4. Point 3) Page 6 line 23: A more extensive discussion of the expected differences
between the 1- and the 2- dimensional versions of the model and the biological
8
reality.
Response: We have included an extensive discussion of the expected differ-
ences between the 1- and 2-dimensional versions both experimentally and theoret-
ically. A 2-dimensional model is closer to biological reality, and a 3-dimensional
model will be the closest model to biological reality. However, due to the chal-
lenges both experimentally and computationally, such extensions are beyond the
scope of this manuscript.
5. Point 4) Page 8, Remark 4.2: You refer to 2-dimensional stepping implying that
the protein will be walking along the surface of the microtubule? You should dis-
cuss that slightly more. .
Response: We have included a brief explanation on the effects of two-dimensional
stepping. Two-dimensional studies are of great interest and forms part of our cur-
rent studies.
6. Point 5) Page 9: The explanation of the synchronization between the two heads
in the paragraph before (4.14) should be more clear.
Response: We have rephrased the wording above equation (4.14) appropri-
ately.
7. Point 6) Page 9: Remark 4.3: Reformulate ”...in Section (d) and in Section
(d)...”.
Response: Thank you. The RSOS template does not differentiate between
subsections from different sections. We had to make this explicit in the text file.
Thank you once again.
8. Point 7) Page 9, Remark 4.4: Clearly this works for discrete steps. How does the
model incorporate the continuity of time?.
Response: Time continuity is reflected and embedded in the time-variables
associated with the domains. These variables are monitored (once computed) if
they are located at the discrete steps or not.
9. Point 8) Page 10, Nondimensionalization: Do you mean that the coefficient of
the acceleration terms, as they emerge from the dimensional analysis, are small
9
and hence neglected, or do you make additional assumptions on their magnitude?.
Response: We thank the reviewer for this useful comment. Indeed, the coeffi-
cients of the acceleration terms can be shown to be small and therefore negligible
compared to the velocity terms and other leading terms. We do not make any
additional assumptions about their magnitudes, these are computed through non-
dimensionalisation.
0. Point 9) Page 11: Independent stepping: ”It has been suggested...” Do you mean
previously in the literature? This sentence implies that some discussion took place
for which the reader of this paper is unaware of.
Response: We have rephrased this statement and indicated with a reference
to show that this suggestion was stated in the literature.
1. Point 10) Page 12: Replace the small letter t by the capital in the interval
[0, tFinal ].
Response: We have changed the notation accordingly.
2. Point 11) Page 12: You refer to the ode45 solver of MATLAB. It would be ad-
visable to briefly mention the underlying numerical method that this solver in-
corporates. This will increase the numerical value of the paper and allow for
non-MATLAB users to reproduce your experiments with greater ease. Same re-
mark holds for the solver ode15s that appears later in the manuscript. Also take
care and refer to MATLAB with all capital letters.
Response: Detailed explanations of MATLAB solvers for systems of (stiff
and non-stiff) ordinary differential equations have been included in appropriate
sections where these appear at first. MATLAB is now referred throughout in
capital letters.
3. Point 12) Page 17, Remark 5.4: It is not clear what the meaning of the ”with
an average of ... 20%” is. Please reformulate. Also give a conclusion to this
Remark, i.e. is the fact ”This is just under...” good or bad for the model?.
Response: The wording as been reformulated. Thanks for the suggestion.
4. Point 13) Page 19, line 16: It seems that the citation [42] refers to the particular
dwelling model instead of MATLAB.
10
Response: Well spotted. We have moved the reference to where it is most
appropriate. Thanks a lot.
5. Point 14) Page 20, line 33: What do you mean by ”external to the model”? Are
there more processes that affect the mathematical model without being addressed
in the paper?.
Response: We have rephrased and stated which external processes are not
modelled.
6. Point 15) Page 13, Figure 4: What do you mean by ”trajectory” for the cargo
and the rest of the components? Is it distance/position? The model (4.20)-(4.25)
that you solve is 1 dimensional after all.
Response: The trajectory refers to the path taken by each of the xi (t), the
distances travelled in time. Also these could be referred to as positions of the
components as a function of time. We have added appropriate wording.
7. Point 16) Page 13, Figure 4: Have you verified that the acceleration that the cargo
velocity (sub-)figure implies, is small enough to be neglected in (4.20)-(4.25)? For
later times, as Figure 5 exhibits, the cargo reaches ”constant” velocity.
Response: Since we have neglected acceleration in our model formulation
through non-dimensionalisation, in the model, there are no terms associated with
acceleration.
8. Point 17) Page 20 line 50: ”stepping probability ... has stepped” isn’t this the
definition of PD ? The reader has done some effort to accept to the notation and
it is better to use it.
Response: Indeed it is the definition, however, we feel the text description is
more suitable than the mathematical definition, for this particular instance.
9. Point 18) Page 23 line 16: E. Campillo-Funollet is not a sole author in [45].
Response: The work referenced by Campillo-Funollet et al. has been now
correctly cited within the discussion on parameter identification using Bayesian
approach.
11
0. Point 19) Page 23 line 19: Reformulate the sentence ”For such a framework ...
data”. Refrain from suggesting other scientists to ”... measure some of the pro-
cesses ...” via the manuscript.
Response: This statement has been removed and we have indicated the need
for space-time series data to help with the inverse problem of finding parameters
given experimental data and the solution of the mathematical model.
