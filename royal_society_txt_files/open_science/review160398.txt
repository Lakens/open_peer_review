Congratulations on an excellent paper. I do have a few minor suggestions which I think would
improve the impact of the work.
First, be up front and clear about the numbers of bats you studied. The abstract and the text are
coyly vague on this matter.
Second. What hypothesis served as the foundation for the work? Perhaps the expectation that
bats should perform as well as birds?
Third, identify specific predictions that you can test with your data ... then link the different
procedures to these predictions. I think that this change will make the paper easier to follow and
at the same time make it much easier for the reader to appreciate the beauty and elegance of the
experimental design and procedures.
I am very excited to see this paper published ... it will change the landscape for those who study
flight in general and bats in particular.
Bravo.

Yes
Is it clear how to access all supporting data?
No. I have not found any reference to online data repository. In this case I would strongly
recommend to upload the raw data - positions and time stamps of each position of each track.
This is because I am very skeptical towards the results and I think others will be too and might
want to check.

General comments
This paper presents nocturnal trackings of Brazilian free-tailed bats. The bats were caught and
tagged with a radio transmitter as they exited their cave in the evening and were tracked from an
airplane for several hours throughout the night. From these position data, flight speeds were
calculated. The median flight speeds that were measured are moderate and perfectly reasonable
in the context of exploratory or feeding flights that the bats were presumably doing, but to a large
degree the focus of the paper lies more on the extreme flight speeds recorded. The authors
present records of very high flight speeds – many above 25 m/s and some up to 50 m/s. This is
highly surprising, since the notion has been so far that bats generally have lower flight
performance in terms of speed compared with birds, whereas these results show speeds that are
up to and even higher than the fastest records of self-powered flights in birds. The authors
compare their results to one of the fastest birds, the common swift, which has been measured at a
top speed of 31 m/s during display flights. The bats in this study have in some cases presumably
maintained flight speed of around 40 m/s for several kilometres which is absolutely astonishing.
Particularly so given the fact that the high flight speed records of swifts were bursts of very brief
high speed display flights, lasting for just a few seconds, as far as I understand from that paper.
The authors compare their results with that study, but do not mention this dramatic difference. In
the swift paper the authors suggested that the power required for performing those short bursts
of flight were close to the maximum of what the swifts could achieve and very different from
their capabilities for sustained flight speed. In the light of this, I do find it very difficult to believe
the results, at least the high speed records. I appreciate the efforts the authors have made to
validate their tracking methods (including tracking a moving car driven at high speeds and
trajectories mimicking the bat flight) and cannot for sure pinpoint where I believe that the flaws
in the method lies, but just common sense tells me that it cannot be right, can it? On the other
hand, I am quite prepared to be convinced, too! Perhaps this might appear as an insulting
suggestion, but have you double checked your units so that there hasn’t been a mistake in some
conversion, or something similar? I am not trying to rain on your parade, I am just genuinely
concerned about these measurements and think it is important to make sure that they are correct
since they in such case are extraordinary!
Specific comments
Introduction paragraph 2:
Perhaps add that the swifts were recorded at these extreme flight speeds only for a brief period,
in the order of seconds.
Reading the reference given here (20), the speed estimated from helicopter was in fact stated as
“excess of 40 mph”, meaning >18 m/s. One estimate from watching the bats leaving the cave
where they were timed at two checkpoints gave an estimate at 35 mph, 15.6 m/s, and finally one
estimate of 60 mph, 26.8 m/s, seemed to have been made from just watching the bats circling the
cave. Please do check this paper again.
Materials and methods paragraph 2
You need to describe the method of determining when the airplane was above the bat more
carefully. I can understand that it is possible to determine when the airplane is laterally in the
correct location using the relative strength between the two antennas (although I am surprised
that a distance between the antennas of just a few meters is sufficient), but the longitudinal
location is less obvious. It is stated in the ms that this was found when the signal amplitude was
maximum. But that signal must be dependent on the altitude difference between the bat and the
airplane and that you don’t know, as you mention yourselves. In such case how do you
4
distinguish between altitude difference and longitudinal difference in position, e.i. the bat being
behind or ahead of the airplane? Considering that the signal strength is different from just the
antenna sitting on one side of the airplane and the antenna sitting on the other when the bat is
laterally offset, distance to the transmitter must have a large impact on signal strength. This is
perhaps the part of the method I would bet on as being the root of the problem with the extreme
flight estimates (if there is such a problem). On the other hand, I suppose that you used the
change in the signal strength as indication of when you were directly above or not – first
approaching until you pass the signal peak and then decelerating again to find the peak again
and so on? But is it possible that fluctuations in the signal due to various disturbances might fool
you to believe that you have found the peak when in reality you have not? Either way, you need
to describe these things better. Everything in the paper hangs on this.
M and M paragraph 3
About wbf: You write that it was analysed “based on changes in radio signals”. It is not obvious
to me why the signal should change with wbf. Please describe this in more detail.
I find it strange that you interpolated the skipped wing beats as if you believe that they were
drop-out of the data, but then still analysed these in the context of flap-gliding flight behaviour.
Perhaps rephrase or clarify.
M an M paragraph 4
“..we calculated several movement metrics.” Several? Better to just say what metrics these were.
M and M paragraph 6
It is obviously difficult to use large scale models of wind speeds and records from a weather
station 40 km away from the measurement areas and still getting any reliable wind estimate at
the resolution you would need for the type of analysis you want to do. I think it might be worth
stating the limitations of this analysis more clearly. I can read between the lines that you are well
aware of this, but it is not stated explicitly. (It would have been great if you had taken some
anemometer measurements in the field as well, to check the correctness of the models). You do
primarily talk about ground speed instead of air speed in the paper, which is reasonable when
you know very little about the winds, but it is still used to draw conclusions about the wind
response strategies and there it might be better to be clear about the uncertainty.
Results paragraph 2
You say “after culling one obvious outlier of 60 m/s…”. Why was that obvious when speeds at
for example 50 were not?
Is it really true to say that just because the points with the extreme flight speeds happen to show a
coherent swarm of point together with the rest of the data that they therefore are not artefacts? If
the error in positioning becomes larger the faster the bats fly, then progressively larger estimates
might appear.
Results paragraph 3
I like the validation with the tracking of the car, but you only present positional accuracy. What
about the speeds? That is after all what you are mostly concerned with in this paper. And I don’t
mean the bootstrap exercise, but the actual measurements of the car.
5
Discussion paragraph 1
When you say that these bats have a similar niche compared with “the fastest birds”. What birds
are you thinking of? Swifts and swallows for example, which are also areal insectivore hunters,
are not at all particularly fast flyers in their typical flight behaviours (perhaps around 10m/s?),
with the exception of the high speed display flights of swifts as you mention. I don’t follow why
you expect these bats to show extreme flight performance. Are they not out foraging during these
flights in the night? If so, what is the benefit of high speed flight then?
Discussion paragraph 3
I do not understand how you mean that the flight speed of these bats might be increased by
increasing the glide phase duration. The only reason for that would firstly be if the bat glides
better than it flaps (which might be the case) and secondly that it is descending during the gliding
bouts. As such it might not be self-powered flight that you are measuring in those instances but
actually gravity assisted. But then again, why and how would the bats perform dives like that?
Discussion paragraph 5
If the positions you recorded are indeed correct it is true that your speed estimates are even the
minimum speed required to fly between points, which means that (especially if the bats are
foraging) they are most certainly flying along non-linear trajectories and therefore even faster
than the speed you have recorded! Help me understand how you think this is possible!

The authors measured flight speeds and flapping frequencies of several Mexican free-tail bats,
using radio transmitters mounted on the bats, which were then tracked by airplane. The

manuscript is well written, the science is relevant and the methods are sound. Getting realistic
flight speeds on bats (and birds) is difficult, but interesting and important for all kinds of
aerodynamic considerations. I therefore recommend publication, but would like to suggest some
minor changes, which I believe would strengthen the manuscript.

I think the authors have put a lot of effort into changing the ms based on my comments and I
think they did a good job in responding to them too. I am still somewhat skeptical to the extreme
flight speeds, but there are no reason for this based on what the authors have explained about the
methods, particularly not now after the many clarifications they have done. My hesitation is
solely due to an intuitive feel for what I think is possible. I think the ms has been significantly
improved and I am satisfied with the responses, so I suggest that it should be accepted for

Comments to the Author(s)
I think the authors have put a lot of effort into changing the ms based on my comments and I
think they did a good job in responding to them too. I am still somewhat skeptical to the extreme
flight speeds, but there are no reason for this based on what the authors have explained about the
methods, particularly not now after the many clarifications they have done. My hesitation is
solely due to an intuitive feel for what I think is possible. I think the ms has been significantly
improved and I am satisfied with the responses, so I suggest that it should be accepted for
publication.

Dear Editors Dunn & Padian
My coauthors and I appreciate the constructive comments and recommendations provided
by the three reviewers of our manuscript on record flight speeds of bats. We also
appreciate the opportunity to respond to the reviews and revise our paper for possible
publication in Royal Science Open Science.
This letter details our revisions and responses to each of the three reviewers. We
distinguish reviewer comments by placing them in italics. Our text edits are placed
within “quotations”.
Response to reviewer #1 (Brock Fenton)
We appreciate Dr Fenton’s very positive review, and have edited the manuscript in
response to his specific suggestions, as follows
First, be up front and clear about the numbers of bats you studied. The abstract and the
text are coyly vague on this matter.
We did not intend coyness with regard to our sample size. We have revised the abstract
to clearly state that we “investigate flight behaviour in seven free-flying Brazilian free-
tailed bats….” We also state in the introduction (revised first sentence of the last
paragraph) that “…we documented the flight trajectories and ground speeds of seven
free-flying T. brasiliensis...”. We have revised the first sentence of Methods to further
clarify that “We tracked a total of seven bats, one bat per night....”. Further, our sample
size of seven bats is clearly illustrated in all Figures and the Table and the sample size of
seven bats is stated in 2 different locations in Discussion.
Second. What hypothesis served as the foundation for the work? Perhaps the
expectation that bats should perform as well as birds?
Done - The first sentence, last paragraph of the Introduction, now states… “To test the
hypothesis that flight performance in the fast flying bats may be underappreciated and
comparable to that of birds, we documented the flight trajectories and ground speeds of
seven free-flying T. brasiliensis.... during their nightly flights in open airspace above
south-western Texas.”
Third, identify specific predictions that you can test with your data ... then link the
different procedures to these predictions. I think that this change will make the paper
easier to follow and at the same time make it much easier for the reader to appreciate the
beauty and elegance of the experimental design and procedures.
We did not have a priori expectations for the results of each procedure, but we appreciate
the value of linking our different procedures to the data and questions that those
procedures allow us to investigate. Therefore in what we believe to be the spirit of Dr
Fenton’s request, the remainder of this section of the Introduction has been revised to
read: “To obtain flight speeds and information on wingbeat frequencies throughout their
nightly flights, each bat carried a dorsally-mounted, continuously emitting radio-
transmitter and was followed from an airplane for its complete nightly flight or until
tracking was abandoned after 3.75 to > 6.5 h of continuous flight. We show that segments
of rapid flight that include ground speeds faster than previously reported for any bat are
interspersed with periods of slower flight and are part of continuous distributions of
ground speeds. We further show that rapid flight is associated with increasing frequency
of pauses in wingbeats implicating an association between flap-gliding and fast flight.
Finally, we employ regional wind modelling to investigate effects of wind support on
flight speeds and demonstrate that bats adjust their flight speeds in response to winds in a
manner consistent with optimizing the costs of flight.”
Response to Reviewer 2’s general comments
We thank Reviewer 2 for his care and constructive comments. This reviewer’s general
comments make no specific suggestions for changes to the text. Rather, the reviewer
summarizes our results, provides several comments on our comparisons with the
published flight speeds of swifts, and expresses skepticism of our results. The reviewer
identifies no flaws in our analysis, but requests that we …double check… our results.
We agree with Reviewer #2’s summary of our findings - the extreme speeds that we
document are surprising - they confront conventional wisdom on the comparative flight
abilities of birds and bats - and the maximum flight speeds that we report exceed those
measured previously for swifts. With regard to the flight speeds measured for bats versus
swifts, the methods employed for making these measurements are extremely different.
But, counter to Reviewer #2’s claim that we …do not mention this dramatic difference…,
we in fact devote the second-to-last paragraph in our discussion to describing and
contextualizing the contrasting methodologies. We state that the speed record for swifts
was obtained from high-speed video recordings over short distances travelled in very
brief time periods, and specifically relate that the average length of the recorded flight
trajectories for swifts was 1.95 m. At the recorded flight speeds of 11.9 to 31.1 m/s, the
durations of these measured trajectories are actually fractions of seconds, which we now
mention in text (see below). Most of these trajectories involved steep climbing flight and
there was strong negative relationship between vertical speed and horizontal speed, but
the brevity of these flight tracks was a result of the technology used to record them, and it
is not at all certain how these very brief tracks relate to the limits of the swifts’ capacity
for high speed flight. Further, in the same paragraph of our discussion, we note that our
ability to document the flight trajectories of free-flying animals over several hours is
unique in the literature. Elsewhere in our discussion, we contextualize the fast speeds that
we measure in these bats with other lines of evidence (PIV, measures of metabolic costs,
bias in types of bats studied) that belie the conventional wisdom and suggest that the full
flight ability of the bats has been underappreciated. As emerging technology, especially
GPS based technology, make it easier to collect data on the complete flights of free-
flying animals, we anticipate that the full range of flight abilities will become clearer for
both fast flying birds and bats.
Reviewer #2 ….cannot for sure pinpoint where I believe that the flaws in the method
lies….and asks that we double check units so that there hasn’t been a mistake in some
conversion, or something similar. In response, we have checked repeatedly for
unexpected problems. The underlying raw data consist of locations with associated time
stamps, i.e. an irregular discrete time sampling of a single nightly trajectory per
individual. All analyses, conversions, statistical tests and plots were programmed in R
and the whole script will be made public along with the study. From the coordinates we
calculated distances using the same function for each individual. The distance function
takes geographic coordinates and returns distance in metres using the Harvesine function
that takes the Earth’s curvature into account. This distance measure is widely used in
geographic information systems and represents the least biased measure of distance
between geographic coordinate system locations (although given the proximity of the
locations to the Equator the Euclidian distances would have been pretty much the same).
The time differences of the timestamps, declared correctly in R and with the correct time
zone assigned, were calculated using a specific function (move::timeLag) that maintains
the integrity of time units, in this case seconds. The package "move" (which coauthor KS
authored and is maintained in his lab) assures that the single trajectories have correctly
assigned geographic projections, ordered time stamps and no duplicate positions are
recorded. Further, the trajectories are stored in the database movebank.org that has a
published data standard. The movement data used here must adhere to this standard,
which further eliminates the potential for mistakes. All data will be made available to the
public with the study, once published, which will, together with the R code allow full
reproducibility of the study. To sum up, we are as confident as we can be that there are no
conversion issues and that error is reduced to measurement error during the process of
data collection. Measurement error in discrete time sampled movements usually is limited
to error in determining the true location, as most modern time pieces have little drift (for
velocity the actual time is not relevant, only the time difference and therefore the drift of
the watch would be the only relevant source of error, which we considered negligible).
Reviewer #2 states …I appreciate the efforts the authors have made to validate their
tracking methods..… Here we elaborate on our efforts to assess the potential effect that
measurement error could have had on the outcome of the study. In this exercise, we
estimated the magnitude of the error in determining the true position of an object moving
at approximately the same velocity as we measured in the bats. From the difference
between the position determined by plane and position determined by a Global
Positioning System device on a rapidly moving car we derived the potential magnitude of
the error of the method compared to a GPS-based sampling (which also has an error
associated, but we neglect here) representing the “true” location. Those differences
between the GPS location and plane-determined positions, which were taken at the exact
same time, were used to move the locations of the bats within a random direction to
assess the effect on our measured velocity values taking into account the realized
empirical combination of time and space in the sampling of the trajectories of the bats. In
this bootstrap exercise the lower limits of the estimates are of much more interest than the
upper ones. Since we moved the locations randomly (assuming a 2 dimensional Gaussian
error distribution with a mean and standard deviation according to the air plane – car
tracking measurements), keeping the (irregular) time schedule unchanged, the original
calculated speed estimates were naturally to represent the means. But it could have been
that the high speeds were the consequence of overestimating distance combined with
small time differences, making much lower actual velocities likely or, in other words, the
high velocities could result from measurement error. However, what we can show is that
even in the unlikely case that the sampling was hugely biased towards almost consistently
overestimating distance, the expected overestimation of speed for those segments
(representing two consecutive locations of an individual) with the unexpectedly high
speeds of 40 plus m/s could only have been somewhere around 9m/s, or less, in 95% of
the cases. With over 30 m/s lower limit of speed for the highest speed segments of the
trajectories, in our view the bats’ performance begs scientific attention and represents an
unexpected high velocity that should understandably be considered extraordinary.
Response to Reviewer #2’s Specific comments
Introduction paragraph 2:
Perhaps add that the swifts were recorded at these extreme flight speeds only for a brief
period, in the order of seconds.
As described in our response (above) to Reviewer #2’s General Comments, the brevity of
these recordings is already mentioned and placed in context with our data in the
Discussion (second from last paragraph). On further consideration of the actual brevity of
these recordings, we revise our parenthetical description of their brevity to now read
“fractions of seconds to several minutes”.
Reading the reference given here (20), the speed estimated from helicopter was in fact
stated as “excess of 40 mph”, meaning >18 m/s. One estimate from watching the bats
leaving the cave where they were timed at two checkpoints gave an estimate at 35 mph,
15.6 m/s, and finally one estimate of 60 mph, 26.8 m/s, seemed to have been made from
just watching the bats circling the cave. Please do check this paper again.
This was a mistake on our part. In the Helicopter flight, Davis et al. 1962 observed bats
receding into the distance from a helicopter moving “in excess of 40 MPH air speed” or
18 m/s. From the ground, they observed horizontal flights “possibly as fast as 60 mph”.
They concluded that “In horizontal flight they (T. brasiliensis) normally fly as fast as 40
mph and can fly at least 60 mph at top speed”. We apologize for this error and correct
the text accordingly
Materials and methods paragraph 2
You need to describe the method of determining when the airplane was above the bat
more carefully. I can understand that it is possible to determine when the airplane is
laterally in the correct location using the relative strength between the two antennas
(although I am surprised that a distance between the antennas of just a few meters is
sufficient), but the longitudinal location is less obvious. It is stated in the ms that this was
found when the signal amplitude was maximum. But that signal must be dependent on the
altitude difference between the bat and the airplane and that you don’t know, as you
mention yourselves. In such case how do you distinguish between altitude difference and
longitudinal difference in position, e.i. the bat being behind or ahead of the airplane?
Considering that the signal strength is different from just the antenna sitting on one side
of the airplane and the antenna sitting on the other when the bat is laterally offset,
distance to the transmitter must have a large impact on signal strength. This is perhaps
the part of the method I would bet on as being the root of the problem with the extreme
flight estimates (if there is such a problem). On the other hand, I suppose that you used
the change in the signal strength as indication of when you were directly above or not –
first approaching until you pass the signal peak and then decelerating again to find the
peak again and so on? But is it possible that fluctuations in the signal due to various
disturbances might fool you to believe that you have found the peak when in reality you
have not? Either way, you need to describe these things better. Everything in the paper
hangs on this.”
Thank you for this critical comment. We fully agree that the precision of this
methodology is absolutely essential. Therefore, we have conducted numerous validations
and tests and always came up with the same, perhaps intuitively unexpectedly high
spatial accuracy. However, this high precision is well known in the aerial tracking world
due to the saturation of the antenna and the receiver when the plane is directly overhead
the radio antenna (see our text insert and two new citations in the manuscript below). We
have additionally advanced the methodology in two ways: we combined pilot and radio
tracker into one person, which omits the problem of the ´deaf flying for the blind´. In our
case, the pilot was also the radio tracker, which improves the internal coordination
massively. Second, we used continuous transmitters that additionally improve temporal
signal peak detection and thus spatial accuracy. A component that cannot be described,
however, is the lifetime experience of tracking animals. Our pilot and coauthor Martin
Wikelski has decades of experience in tracking animals from the air. To quantify this
would be akin to asking a good violin player to describe how to strike a perfect tone.
Nevertheless, we have now provided a much more detailed description of the
methodology, which we hope satisfies the reader.
To address Reviewer #2’s concerns, newly inserted text now reads:
..... “The effectiveness of this method has been proven repeatedly [22]. Its power relies
upon both the human ear and the signal transmission/antenna reception pattern of radio
transmitters. First, the human ear is a superb instrument to determine sound amplitude
differences [23]. Second, as the aircraft passes directly over the transmitter, the gain of
the antenna dipole is placed directly on the transmitter. The transmitter signal strength as
perceived by the antennas shows an extremely steep peak at this point. Only at this point
the radio signal completely saturates the receiver and the audio output of the receiver
changes from a ´beep´, or in our case, a continuous sinusoidal whistle, into a plodding or
´thud´ sound or a deep, loud ´humm´. For a continuous transmitter, the timing of the
absolute peak signal level can be determined with a higher precision compared to a
pulsed transmitter, because the specific time of maximum received power can be
narrowed down to a few milliseconds by the human ear [23], compared to a sequence of
one or two second-interspersed beeps in a pulsed transmitter. This more precise timing
translates into an improved spatial accuracy. In our case the signal-to-location matching
was made easier as the pilot also conducted the radio telemetry, which is not usually the
case in aerial telemetry.”
In the following paragraph we add additional evidence for the spatial accuracy of our
methodology by relating the observation of locating a radio-tagged bat that “…..entered
an abandoned building ....to the nearest 50 meters using the method described above,
allowing us to get a visual confirmation of the bat inside the building.....”
M and M paragraph 3
About wbf: You write that it was analysed “based on changes in radio signals”. It is not
obvious to me why the signal should change with wbf. Please describe this in more detail.
Sorry we have not been precise enough here. This comment, and reviewer #2’s next
comment -
I find it strange that you interpolated the skipped wing beats as if you believe that they
were drop-out of the data, but then still analysed these in the context of flap-gliding flight
behaviour. Perhaps rephrase or clarify. - address a similar issue. Therefore, we address
these comments together, and add revised text that we hope will clarify our analyses and
interpretations
“….For a continuous transmitter, the slight pressure changes induced onto the body of the
transmitter by the beating of the wings in a bat or bird (i.e., the up-and-down movements
of the animal’s body) result in a change in transmitted signal amplitude, which can be
easily discerned by the human ear or analyzed via audio programs. A graphical
description is shown in [21]. …….When the amplitude of the recorded radio signal did
not change, i.e., when there was no wingbeat, the numbers of skipped beats were
interpolated, as was previously done for songbirds [21].”
M an M paragraph 4
“..we calculated several movement metrics.” Several? Better to just say what metrics
these were.”
We agree. The sentence now reads: “We investigated the flight trajectories, and used the
statistical and programming environment R (version 3.0.2) and the package “move” to
calculate, duration, distances, and form those measures, speed for each track segment and
total and net displacement for each bat’s nightly flight. Distances were based on great
circle distances from the coordinates of the trajectories taking into account the curvature
of the Earth surface”.
M and M paragraph 6
It is obviously difficult to use large scale models of wind speeds and records from a
weather station 40 km away from the measurement areas and still getting any reliable
wind estimate at the resolution you would need for the type of analysis you want to do. I
think it might be worth stating the limitations of this analysis more clearly. I can read
between the lines that you are well aware of this, but it is not stated explicitly. (It would
have been great if you had taken some anemometer measurements in the field as well, to
check the correctness of the models). You do primarily talk about ground speed instead of
air speed in the paper, which is reasonable when you know very little about the winds,
but it is still used to draw conclusions about the wind response strategies and there it
might be better to be clear about the uncertainty.
We are aware of the limitations of using a large scale weather model for a local scale
phenomenon, but it was the only data available and we think that the outcome is
informative. That said, we appreciate the comment, and we insert the following sentence
in the above referenced paragraph to more explicitly clarify this uncertainty: “Although
large scale weather models cannot capture the dynamics and turbulence structure of any
single place and time, they provide the only data available and evidence suggests that we
can expect large scale models to correlate with local conditions [24]”.
We further qualify the uncertainty of our findings regarding the atmospheric conditions in
the discussion (last 2 sentences, 3rd Paragr). As we actually have no way of really
assessing whether it is better or worse to use low resolution wind data in this case (see
below), we think that it is best to qualify the results in the discussion and thereby allow a
presumably informed reader to decide on the value of the findings.
We have carefully considered these issues and offer the following considerations. The
use of an anemometer is unfortunately not so straight forward as one might think and the
logistics involved in modelling a regional atmospheric model for that still quite large
potential volume of air space is daunting to say the least. This also suggests that higher
resolution (space and time) wind information might improve the situation, but could be
actually less informative, if it was not really representing the relevant space and time
domain in which the bats were operating. With more resolution also comes more noise
and it will be imminently more important to get the atmospheric conditions at the actual
location (in 3 dimensions). Given we have, as of now, no altitudinal information of the
bats locations, a higher resolution wind model would have to represent the entirety of the
atmospheric column and still we would have to make some assumptions about the actual
flight altitude, with possibly wildly different results. Thus, in effect, using a low
resolution, averaged out larger scale model might represent the best of all bad options,
even if we had had used a 3D array of anenometers. Better would have been a pitot
sensor on the bats, a device that we have developed and deployed on raptors, but which
will not fit small bats at least for the near future. To sum up, we do find some patterns,
which are to be expected to occur, if the bats reacted according to theories of optimal
flight theory, so in our view, the wind data are not entirely information-free in relation to
the patterns we observed. The true magnitude and the real estimates of the effect sizes are
likely to be different, but that remains to be investigated.
Results paragraph 2
You say “after culling one obvious outlier of 60 m/s…”. Why was that obvious when
speeds at for example 50 were not?
With the exception of that one instance of 60.1 m/s we did not record speeds of higher
than ~44.7m/s, hence that one instance was characterized by a difference of more than
15m/s higher speed than the next highest speed observation. The next highest differences
in speed between the ordered speed measurements were 2.3, 1.8, 1.7, 1.5, 1.4 and so on.
To clarify why we consider this observation an outlier the text now reads…”After culling
one apparent outlier of 60.1 m s-1 that was >15 m s-1 above the next fastest speed of 44.7
m s-1, we confirmed......”
Is it really true to say that just because the points with the extreme flight speeds happen
to show a coherent swarm of point together with the rest of the data that they therefore
are not artefacts? If the error in positioning becomes larger the faster the bats fly, then
progressively larger estimates might appear.
We have addressed and dismiss this possibility. We estimated the magnitude of the error
at the recorded speeds exactly to assess the possibility that segments of high speed could
represent artifacts of sampling, and we are confident they are not. Besides bootstrapping,
which we explain in more detail above, we also checked whether the high velocity
sections belonged to a specific subset of segment length and/or durations. As could have
happened if for unknown reasons, long segments were recorded consistently when the
sampling rate was higher and time was thus consistently shorter during long segments
compared to the average sample. Naturally, high velocity is the result of distance divided
by time, so the proportional difference of the two measures, and a consistent bias in either
one would suggest (but not prove) a potential problem. The high speed segments,
however, do not belong to a specific subset of particularly long segments. High velocity
segments do belong to the shorter time intervals between samples, but are well within the
range of the other segments. In fact, removing speeds of higher than 25 m/s does not
change the general relationship between the linear correlation estimates of speed vs. time
(slopes: -.88±.05 vs. -.84±.06) and also the slope of distance vs. speed (slopes: -.31±.06
vs. -.30±.06) remained unchanged when including or excluding the highest speeds.
Results paragraph 3
I like the validation with the tracking of the car, but you only present positional accuracy.
What about the speeds? That is after all what you are mostly concerned with in this
paper. And I don’t mean the bootstrap exercise, but the actual measurements of the car.
We respectfully disagree. Rather, we are mostly concerned with our positional accuracy
in locating the speeding car from the airplane at the exact time for which the car’s exact
position is known. That is the relevant information for validating our estimates of the
speed of the bats.
Discussion paragraph 1
When you say that these bats have a similar niche compared with “the fastest birds”.
What birds are you thinking of? Swifts and swallows for example, which are also areal
insectivore hunters, are not at all particularly fast flyers in their typical flight behaviours
(perhaps around 10m/s?), with the exception of the high speed display flights of swifts as
you mention. I don’t follow why you expect these bats to show extreme flight
performance. Are they not out foraging during these flights in the night? If so, what is the
benefit of high speed flight then?
Among aerial insectivores, molossid bats, swifts and swallows share similar aerial niches
in that they hunt insects in open, unobstructed airspace above canopy. Swifts and
molossid bats share morphological traits (high aspect ratio wings and, relative to sister
taxa, high wing loading) and similarities in flight dynamics (as illustrated by PIV), that
reflect these similar aerial niches. Many other bats and birds hunt insects in more
cluttered habitats (e.g. below canopy) and have different flight dynamics and
morphologies that reflect the different demand of the niche space that they inhabit. As
discussed above, swifts have been studied intensively (as have molossid bats, but to a
lesser degree), in the context of their abilities for rapid, efficient flight, which is what we
referred to as extreme flight performance.
In response to the reviewer’s comments we have edited “the fastest flying birds” to read
“swifts and swallows”, and we replace “extreme” with “efficient, high speed flight
performance”. The second sentence of the discussion now reads “……T. brasiliensis
exploits an aerial niche similar to that of swifts and swallows, leading us to expect
efficient, high speed flight performance in these bats. “
Discussion paragraph 3
I do not understand how you mean that the flight speed of these bats might be increased
by increasing the glide phase duration. The only reason for that would firstly be if the bat
glides better than it flaps (which might be the case) and secondly that it is descending
during the gliding bouts. As such it might not be self-powered flight that you are
measuring in those instances but actually gravity assisted. But then again, why and how
would the bats perform dives like that?
The increase in ground speed with increased wingbeat pauses comes from our data.
Earlier studies have demonstrated that some birds (e.g. swifts) increase their lift to drag
ratio during glide phases and save up to 15% in energetic costs over continuous flapping.
In response to a suggestion of Reviewer #3, we have incorporated a recent paper on flap-
gliding in birds which suggests that energetic benefits also may accrue from reducing
costs of muscle activation during down stroke and reducing the need to compensate for
weight support during upstroke. This paper emphasizes that flap-gliding in birds is often
associated with steady, direct flight and that flap-gliding birds are not necessarily
descending. Flap-gliding in bats has received very little study and it may be, in fact, that
bats glide better than has been previously thought - there are simply too few observations
of flap-gliding in bats to know what is possible. One study on bats with low wing
loading and low wing aspect ratio showed them to increase flight speeds and lose altitude
during glides. The increase in ground speed in our study may result both from increased
efficiency and the gravity-assisted recovery of kinetic energy. Without data on the
altitude of the bats, we do not know if or how much the bats may be descending during
wing-beat pauses, but the data suggest that they also increase ground speed. Why and
how they do this will be a major focus of our future research.
In incorporating the paper on flap-gliding in birds that is recommended by Reviewer 3,
we have significantly revised the Discussion (paragr 4) to address these issues (see
below).
Discussion paragraph 5
If the positions you recorded are indeed correct it is true that your speed estimates are
even the minimum speed required to fly between points, which means that (especially if
the bats are foraging) they are most certainly flying along non-linear trajectories and
therefore even faster than the speed you have recorded! Help me understand how you
think this is possible!
Yes, these measures are likely underestimations, and we make this point in the second
last sentence of our discussion. But, the amount of underestimation is probably
decreasing with increasing speed. Adding to the unaccounted sinuosity of the track in the
times the animal was unobserved between two fixes, is the fact that in the 3 dimensions
the distances are going to be actually larger than in the 2 dimensional plane in which we
quantified them. The effect however might not be that dramatic, as experience (in many
different taxa and using many different methods) teaches that the sinuosity of trajectories
decreases drastically with speed, so the faster animals go, the less likely they are to make
twists and turns. Usually there is a pronounced decrease in the variance of turning angles
compared to speed, which also means that the higher speeds are possibly closer to the
instantaneous speed of the animal. So in respect to the top speeds, the underestimation in
fact might not be that dramatic. This is none-the-less a valid question that arises from our
intriguing observations. We expect that it will take others beyond us to work out the
mechanisms.
Response to Reviewer 3’s Comments
We appreciate Reviewer 3’s positive review and the reviewer’s comments on the
importance of this work. Below we reply to this Reviewer’s suggestions for changes to
strengthen the manuscript.
Page 1, Line 17: My understanding is that terrestrial COT is more expensive than flight.
Please elaborate. If no references are allowed in the abstract, please pick up on this
statement in the introduction.
Cost of transport (COT) refers specifically to the expenditure of energy per unit distance
per unit body mass which, as Reviewer 3 notes, is higher during running than during
flight. However, we here refer to metabolic rate, energy consumed per unit time, for
which flight is overall, more expensive (see Harrison and Roberts, 2000, Flight
respiration and energetics, Ann. Rev. Physiol 62:179-205 for review). We appreciate
that this is a potential source of confusion, and rather than add a citation, we make the
more expedient fix by removing the introductory phrase that could be the source of
confusion.
Page 1, Line 44: I am not sure about this statement considering that the wake of birds
often shows tail vortices which makes them quite complex as well.
We agree that that this is no reason that bat wakes should, a priori, be more complex than
those of birds, particularly given the vortices shed from bird tails and the potential for
complex bird wakes. Nonetheless, the reversed vortex loops that are characteristic of
wakes of most bats studied to date at most flight speeds are considered by several writers
on the subject to make their wakes more complex, as, for example, when assessed by
span efficiency as a one quantitative measure (for further discussion, see Muijres, F. T.,
Johansson, L. C., Bowlin, M. S., Winter, Y., & Hedenstrom, A. (2012). Comparing
aerodynamic efficiency in birds and bats suggests better flight performance in birds.
PLoS ONE, 7(5), e37335, Hedenstrom, A., & Johansson, L. C. (2015). Bat flight:
aerodynamics, kinematics and flight morphology. J. Exp. Biol., 218(Pt 5), 653–663; and
Chin, D. D., & Lentink, D. (2016). Flapping wing aerodynamics: from insects to
vertebrates. J. Exp. Biol., 219(Pt 7), 920–932). This assessment is based, however, on a
limited number of bat and bird species and a very restricted set of flight behaviors.
We are not inclined to agree with this perspective, but it is a common view and often
mentioned in discussions of comparative aerodynamics of birds and bats, and thus
appropriate to mention here.
Page 2, Line 3: “Because the scaling of wing span and wing area to body mass differs
between the two groups, bats, which show lower wing loading (mass per area of wing
surface),”
There is quite a variation in bat and bird species. Please clarify if you are talking about
all bats or “the average bat”
Yes, we are referring to the average bat and edit this sentence to read: “Because the
scaling of wing span and wing area to body mass differs between the two groups, bats,
which on average show lower wing loading (mass per area of wing surface),….”
Page 2, Line 14: “Similar to swifts, bats of the F. Molossidae have high wing loading
and high aspect ratio wings [11,16],”
Should there be a "relative" in here? Considering that, at least if compared to Tadarida,
the wing loading of swifts is considerably higher.
Point well taken, “relatively” is inserted. The wing loading of swifts is actually about 2.5
times higher than that of Brazilian free-tailed bats.
Page 3, Line 29: Do you mean with “checked” that they were followed on subsequent
days? If so, how did this work if each night another bat was captured and followed?
Please elaborate.
By “checked” we mean that bats were “located within the roost”. The sentence is
appropriately edited
Page 4, Line 3: I don't have the paper in front of me, but I seem to remember that they
were rather cautious about the accuracy of these measurements (which would not
surprise me). If that is the case I think it is worth mentioning this here as well.
We’ve struggled with how to respond to this comment and find it difficult to do so. We
are not sure that we understand the comment.
Page 4, Line 14: I don't understand what great circle distances are
We now clarify that “great circle distances” account for the curvature of Earth
Page 4, Line 51: I would prefer to have the equation included here or in the suppl.
material instead of just providing the reference
The equations, including a schematic representation of the calculated measures, are now
included as electronic supplementary material, figure 1.
Page 5, Line 51: May I suggest to specify what kind of target it was? Why not call a car a
car?
Done
Page 6, Line 8: I am not sure the average reader necessarily knows the definition of
airspeed and ground speed. They might appreciate a little help here.
We provide this help to readers and define ground speed and air speed on the first usage
of these terms; i.e. page 4, Lines 41 and 51. The equations defining these terms also have
been inserted in the electronic supplementary materials.
Page 7, Line 31-39: There is a recent paper about flap gliding. I suggest to incorporate it
in this discussion. Usherwood, James Richard. "Physiological, aerodynamic and
geometric constraints of flapping account for bird gaits, and bounding and flap-gliding
flight strategies." Journal of Theoretical Biology (2016).
We appreciate being directed to this recent and relevant paper. We now cite this paper
and revise the text accordingly. Because our revisions are extensive, we here give the
full paragraph, the recent Usherwood paper is citation [38]….
“Flap-gliding, where flying animals alternate between powered flapping wingbeats and
gliding, is documented for many birds [21,35], but for only a few bats [36,37]. In a recent
aerodynamic model, lift-to-drag ratio increased during gliding in common swifts
reducing the energetic costs of continuous flapping flight [35]. Recent work also
indicates that energetic benefits may accrue from flap-gliding by reducing costs of
muscle activation during downstroke and reducing the need to compensate for loss of
weight-support during upstroke [38]. Flap-gliding in birds is often associated with steady,
direct flight [38]. One previous study showed captive bats to increase flight speeds during
steep downward glides [33], but there are, to date, no data on the energetics and flight
performance of flap-gliding in bats. Our data associating higher ground speeds with
wingbeat pauses (figure 4) [21] suggest that flap-gliding assists the rapid flight of
Brazilian free-tailed bats, but data are as yet insufficient to test hypotheses relating flap-
gliding to flight speeds.”
Figure 1: Arrows are hard to see, may I suggest a thinner line width?
Figure 1 has been revised as suggested. The arrows are easier to see.
Page 12, Line 16: what are the densities based on? Normal distribution, kernel etc?
Please specify.
The Figure legend has been revised to specify that these are “kernel densities”.
This completes our responses to the comments and suggestions of the three reviewers.
In addition to these responses, we provide an additional, minor revision to the first
paragraph of the Discussion to cite another relevant and newly published work (Hubel, T.
Y., Hristov, N. I., Swartz, S. M., & Breuer, K. S. (2016). Wake structure and kinematics
in two insectivorous bats. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B, 371, 20150385) that describes PIV wake
structure during flight in an another bat species and makes comparison to Brazilian free-
tailed bats. The affected section now reads:
....“To date, PIV has been employed to investigate flight in seven of the over 1300
currently described species of bats [26]. Four of these, Glossophaga soricina,
Leptonycteris yerbabuenae [5,27], Cynopterus brachyotis [28], and Carollia perspicillata
[14] are nectar/fruit-eating bats with broad low aspect ratio wings that fly in cluttered
habitats and are capable of hovering, and two are small broad-winged insectivores [8,29].
The seventh species is T. brasiliensis. In general, the six broad-winged species produced
the complex wake structures typically associated with lower lift-to-drag ratios and
reduced span efficiency in bats [5,8,27,28,29]. “
We hope that with these revisions you will find this manuscript acceptable for publication
in Royal Science Open Science.
Thank you very much for your attention and consideration.
