The authors present a survey of the low-lying minima on the potential energy surfaces of
endohedral gold clusters, M@Au16. The methodology chosen is appropriate, and compatible
with the authors' previous work in the field. The analysis is also well considered, and so I am
happy to recommend publication.
I think that the manuscript would be more clear if cluster shapes were labelled more consistently
- for example, cluster b for Mo is clearly isostructural with cluster a for Tc, a (Mo) == c (Tc),
d(Mo) = b(Tc) etc etc. It is interesting that multiplicities vary substantially in some cases (SM = 2
for d(Mo) but 7 for b(Tc) despite the fact that they differ by only one electron. Can the authors
comment on why this is?
Likewise, is there a reason why the symmetry for structures A in table 1 is so dependent on
functional? Is the switch from D2d - S4 - C2 - C1 (B3LYP - BP86 - PW91 - TPSS) significant, or are
these in fact very small distortions?

My points have mostly been addressed. However, while Ref. 34 does indeed deal with coupling
MD and DFT, Ref. 35 (about the basin hopping method) is for empirical potentials. There have
been many application sof basin hopping and genetic algorithms to elucidate structures of
clusters of around this size, directly at the DTT level (or beyond) - for example:
A. Shayeghi et al. Phys.Chem.Chem.Phys., 2015, 17, 2104
J.A. Vargas et al. J. Phys. Chem. C, 2017, 121, 10982
W.-C. Ng et al. AIP Conference Proceedings 1657, 070004 (2015); doi: 10.1063/1.4915199
Concerning the oither reviewer's questions, I thinbk the authoirs' response to Q2 is rather
superficial. Of course the different number of electrons means a different between even and odd
numbers of unpaired electrons but not the large difference in spin from a doublet (the lowest
possiblespin multiplicity for an odd number of electrons) and 7 (rather than say a singlet or
triplet). The atomic radius and how on-site exchange energies and degree of d-electron
delocalisation changes with M-Au distance for Mo and Tc are likely to be critical.

label_comment_8
The authors have dealt with the majority of issues that I raised in the original review.
For the multiplicity issue, the increase in number of electrons by 1 (Mo - Tc) might be expected to
increase MS by 1, but in fact MS seems to increase by much more, suggesting a greater tendency
to high-spin for Tc than Mo. The argument that it is down to different sizes seems superficial - Tc
will be a bit smaller but why should this make a difference? Is it because Tc is nearer the middle
of the PT and therefore favouring a local half-filled shell? This is important in Mn clusters, but I
would not have expected a major influence for Tc.
The one remaining point where I do disagree with the authors is in the treatment of symmetry. If
their criterion of symmetry breaking is that bonds that would be related by symmetry operations
differ by 0.001 A then I think almost any structure would be classified as C1, at which point the
use of symmetry labels becomes pointless. I would place the confidence limit on bond lengths at
about 0.01 A for gold clusters, so differences an order of magnitude smaller than this are probably
numerical noise. For the structures labbeled as having higher symmetry, did the optimisation
start from C1 and revert back to the higher symmetry form to less than the stated tolerance, or
did they start from high-symmety structures in the first place? I would recommend that in cases
where the structures are near a high-symmetry point, the authors should optimise starting from a
structure that has the full symmetry to see whether their stated low-symmetry minima really are
more stable.
My opinion is that the symmetry (or lack thereof) in these clusters is an important issue, and in
general clusters only distort from high symmetry if there is a good reason to do so (Jahn-Teller
etc). So if these really are C1, C2 etc rather than D2d or S4, the authors need to explain why.
Minor point: h and i seem to have been swapped over in Figure 3.

Manuscript ID: RSOS-171019 Response to Referees
Appendix A
Responds to Referees
We have studied comments carefully and have made correction which we hope meet
with approval. Revised portion are marked in blue in the paper. Below are our
responses to the Reviewer’s comments. The page and line numbers refer to our
revised manuscript submitted Sep. 12, 2017.
Reviewer #1:
1) There is significant interest in the effect of doping on the structural, electronic and
other properties of metal clusters. Endohedral doping of hollow Au clusters is of
particular interest. The current manuscript describes DFT calculations of Mo-
and Tc-centered Au16- clusters. The paper is quite well presented, though the
English needs some editing. (For example, the title should be "Stabilization of a
golden cage ..." or "Stabilization of golden cages ...".
Response: "Stabilization of golden cages ..." has been corrected.
2) Page 1 (line 27) "planar structures"
Response: Done.
3) (line 29) "forthcoming" should be replaced by "future"
Response: "forthcoming" has been changed to "future".
4) (line 34) "a plenty of" should be replaced by "many"
Response: "a plenty of" has been changed to "many".
5) (line 36) "as in the fabrication"
Response: "as in the fabrication" was corrected
6) (line 45) "to the possibility"
Response: Done
7) Page 3 (Section 4.1) The relative ordering of structures A (3D) and B (2D) for the
anionic and neutral clusters is a little surprising, as it is generally found that the
Manuscript ID: RSOS-171019 Response to Referees
stability of planar structures are enhanced for anionic over neutral clusters. What
is not clear from the discussion is whether the neutral Au16 cluster has also been
studied with the alternative PBEPBE/.LANL2DZ approach.
Response: For the neutral and anionic host cluster Au16, we present two types of
structures: a perfect cage D2d structure A and a high symmetric planar C2v
structure B. The order of labels (A and B) in present paper is based on the
following two points: 1) Structure A is the most reasonable isomer at the high
level PBEPBE/SDD+2f; 2) The order of labels is consistent with our recent results
published in 2014 in Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. journal (Ref. 23). For the neutral
Au16 cluster, the corresponding description is increased in the revised manuscript
(see 4.1, at the bottom of the first paragraph). A detailed discussion on the neutral
Au16 cluster at the PBEPBE/LANL2DZ level of theory can be found in our
recently published article (Ref. 23, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2014, 16, 244–254).
8) (line 29) "is obvious agree" should be "obviously agrees"
Response: "is obvious agree" has been modified to "obviously agrees".
9) (line 38) "are almost all low-symmetry"
Response: Done
10) Page 4 (line 31) "discrepant energy" shouold be "difference in energy"
Response: "discrepant energy" has been modified to "difference in energy".
11) References - should be extended to include related methods such as direct DFT
global optimisation using genetic algorithm or basin hopping Monte Carlo search
methods.
Response: Two relevant references (Car R, Parrinello M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1985, 55,
2471–2474; Wales DJ, Doye JPK. J. Phys. Chem. A, 1997, 101, 5111–5116) are
increased in the revised paper (Refs. 35 and 36). The related descriptions about
the two references are provided in revised paper (see P1 and P2).
12) Figure legends: Phrases such as "top-11 lowest energy" should be "11 lowest
Manuscript ID: RSOS-171019 Response to Referees
energy"
Response: "top-11 lowest energy" has been modified to "11 lowest energy"
Reviewer #2:
1) The authors present a survey of the low-lying minima on the potential energy
surfaces of endohedral gold clusters, M@Au16. The methodology chosen is
appropriate, and compatible with the authors' previous work in the field. The
analysis is also well considered, and so I am happy to recommend publication.
I think that the manuscript would be more clear if cluster shapes were labelled
more consistently - for example, cluster b for Mo is clearly isostructural with
cluster a for Tc, a (Mo) == c (Tc), d(Mo) = b(Tc) etc etc.
Response: According to the suggestion of the reviewer, we have modified the
labels (a)~(f), (h) and (i) in figure 3 and isomers were labelled consistently in
figure 2 and figure 3. Meanwhile, corresponding label modifications of Figure 5
also have been done. Simultaneously, the corresponding changes of symbol in the
manuscript and electronic supplementary material are marked with blue text.
2) It is interesting that multiplicities vary substantially in some cases (SM = 2 for
d(Mo) but 7 for b(Tc) despite the fact that they differ by only one electron. Can the
authors comment on why this is?
Response: The effect of spin multiplicity (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 for Mo-doped; 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
for Tc-doped) is also taken into account in the present study. The 11 lowest-
energy isomers of MAu16– (M= Mo and Tc) obtained from a SK global search
combined with DFT optimization and total energy calculation are presented in this
paper. We consider two reasons to contribute to the change in spin multiplicities
of MoAu16– and TcAu16–. First, the different valence-electron configurations of
Mo and Tc can lead to the different multiplicity. The second point concerns the
different atomic radius between the two atoms. So, we speculate that the two
Manuscript ID: RSOS-171019 Response to Referees
effects may cause a change in spin multiplicities of MoAu16– and TcAu16–.
3) Likewise, is there a reason why the symmetry for structures A in table 1 is so
dependent on functional? Is the switch from D2d - S4 - C2 - C1 (B3LYP - BP86 -
PW91 - TPSS) significant, or are these in fact very small distortions?
Response: The change of symmetry for structures A in Table 1 is mainly due to
the tight tolerance for the point group symmetry. The tight tolerance for the
relative change in the point group symmetry was set to 0.001 Å, that is, if the
bond length changes greater than 0.001 Å, it is considered to be two different
structures. Therefore, the symmetry for structure A in table 1 is sensitive to
functional.
Thanks to both reviewers for the thoughtful and thorough review.
Hopefully we have addressed all of your concerns.

empirical potentials. There have been many applications of basin hopping and genetic
algorithms to elucidate structures of clusters of around this size, directly at the DTT
level (or beyond) - for example:
A. Shayeghi et al. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2015, 17, 2104
J.A. Vargas et al. J. Phys. Chem. C, 2017, 121, 10982

Concerning the other reviewer's questions, I think the authors’' response to Q2 is
rather superficial. Of course, the different number of electrons means a different
between even and odd numbers of unpaired electrons but not the large difference in
spin from a doublet (the lowest possible spin multiplicity for an odd number of
electrons) and 7 (rather than say a singlet or triplet). The atomic radius and how
on-site exchange energies and degree of d-electron delocalization changes with M-Au
distance for Mo and Tc are likely to be critical.
Response Q1: The references mentioned by the reviewer have been added to the
revised manuscript. In addition, we made some changes for the second question of
reviewer 2. The difference of spin multiplicity of structure d between MoAu16- and
TcAu16- may be due to the fact that the valence electron configuration of Mo is 4d55s1,
the unpaired electron in the 5s orbital is easily hybridized with 4d ones to form 4d-5s

hybridization, thus reducing spin multiplicity. For TcAu16-, the valence electron
configuration of Tc is 4d55s2. 4d orbit is just a half-filled shell and two electrons fill
the 5s orbit, which leads to the electron structure is not easy to break, thereby making
the structure d of TcAu16- high spin.
Reviewer #2:
Q1: For the multiplicity issue, the increase in number of electrons by 1 (Mo - Tc)
might be expected to increase MS by 1, but in fact MS seems to increase by much
more, suggesting a greater tendency to high-spin for Tc than Mo. The argument that it
is down to different sizes seems superficial - Tc will be a bit smaller but why should
this make a difference? Is it because Tc is nearer the middle of the PT and therefore
favouring a local half-filled shell? This is important in Mn clusters, but I would not
have expected a major influence for Tc.
Response Q1: Yes, we also feel that the previous answer was a bit superficial. In
order to solve this problem, we have also carried on the detailed discussion with the
peer experts, but there has been no better explanation. The difference of spin
multiplicity of structure d between MoAu16- and TcAu16- may be due to the fact that the
valence electron configuration of Mo is 4d55s1, the unpaired electron in the 5s orbital
is easily hybridized with 4d ones to form 4d-5s hybridization, thus reducing spin
multiplicity. For TcAu16-, the valence electron configuration of Tc is 4d55s2. 4d orbit is
just a half-filled shell and two electrons fill the 5s orbit, which leads to the electron
structure is not easy to break, thereby making the structure d of TcAu16- high spin.
Q2: The one remaining point where I do disagree with the authors is in the
treatment of symmetry. If their criterion of symmetry breaking is that bonds that would
be related by symmetry operations differ by 0.001 A then I think almost any structure
would be classified as C1, at which point the use of symmetry labels becomes pointless.
I would place the confidence limit on bond lengths at about 0.01 A for gold clusters,
so differences an order of magnitude smaller than this are probably numerical noise.
For the structures labeled as having higher symmetry, did the optimization start from
Manuscript ID: RSOS-171019.R1 Response to Reviewers
C1 and revert back to the higher symmetry form to less than the stated tolerance, or
did they start from high-symmetry structures in the first place? I would recommend
that in cases where the structures are near a high-symmetry point, the authors should
optimise starting from a structure that has the full symmetry to see whether their
stated low-symmetry minima really are more stable.
My opinion is that the symmetry (or lack thereof) in these clusters is an important
issue, and in general clusters only distort from high symmetry if there is a good
reason to do so (Jahn-Teller etc). So if these really are C1, C2 etc rather than D2d or
S4, the authors need to explain why.
Response Q2: For geometry optimization, various initial structures including C1,
C2, C2v, D2d point symmetry et.al are considered in our geometry optimization of the
Au16 cluster. Of course, sometimes when Au16 cluster was placed with high symmetry
structure during the geometry optimization process, it either did not converge or
converged to a low symmetry or ground state structure. Among all calculated isomers,
the lowest-energy structure is presented. In addition, in order to compare the degree
of structural change under different point group symmetry, we recalculate the average
bond length of structure A. The results show that the average bond length of anionic
Au16 is 2.85, 2.81, 2.80, 2.80, 2.78 Å for B3LYP, BP86, PBE, PW91, TPSS functional,
respectively, and for neutral Au16, the calculated average length using the five
functional is 2.86, 2.81, 2.81,2.81,2.79 Å. It can be seen from the above data of
average bond length, whether for neutral cluster or anionic Au16 cluster, the
calculated values using BP86, PBE, PW91 and TPSS functionals are close to each
other(about 2.8 Å for Au16 and 2.81 Å for Au16-), indicating that structure distortion of
these isomers calculated using different functionals are not obvious. The result of
B3LYP functional is a little larger than those of other functional. B3LYP functional is
not suitable for the study of gold clusters, which has been confirmed by study in
the pure golden clusters Aun- (n =16–18) [Ref. 27: S. Bulusu et al. Evidence of hollow
golden cages. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006, 103, 8326–8330].
Q3: Minor point: h and i seem to have been swapped over in Figure 3
Manuscript ID: RSOS-171019.R1 Response to Reviewers
ResponseQ3: Yes, in order to label the isomer consistently in figure 2 and figure 3,
we have modified the labels (a)~(f), (h) and (i) in figure 3. This was mentioned in the
last responds to reviewers.
Hopefully we have addressed all your concerns.
Thank you and best regards.
