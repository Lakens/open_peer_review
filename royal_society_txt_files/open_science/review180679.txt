In this paper Laan and colleagues develop and test a machine learning approach to study
zebrafish aggression. This software is able to recognise unmarked individuals and compare their
locomotion during dyadic fights. Using data collected here the authors are able to assess the
movements made by both attackers and defenders, providing insights into the decisions made
during aggressive encounters.
There are several major advances shown in this study, not least that it provides a qualitative
measure of aggression (such as fighting intensity) rather than simply quantifying duration of
attack, something that has been missing in other studies. It also provides a better overview of
bout structure of both animals in the test. This software could be ideal to study hyperaggressive
3
mutants to see whether they break rules seen in wild-type fish. For example, extremely
aggressive rodents sometimes bite the head instead of the flank of other animals suggesting a
similar sort of rule breaking. I am very excited about this research and its potential to strengthen
the zebrafish aggression field. I have several comments for the authors about how to improve this
study.
Major comments
1) A weakness of this study is that it is based upon whole body movement without taking into
account appendages such fins. It is likely that display information is lost because of this. Can the
resolution of films be increased to capture this information as well?
2) The text throughout is too long and contains a lot of sentences that are not required. For
example, on page 2 – “Let us consider how much is known about attack manoeuvres in in
zebrafish” can be removed since it does not tell the reader anything. Likewise the results section
contains a lot of discussion that can be removed. Overall the paper needs rewriting to make it
clearer and more focussed.
3) It is difficult to know whether or not this method can distinguish between non-aggressive
social interaction and aggression. This could be tested by presenting the results obtained from
two fish that exhibit sociality without attacking each other
4) The choice of males that formed the aggressive pairs is not clear. They should have been
equally size-matched since large fish always win fights. This point is discussed later in the paper,
but the confound of using non-equivalent films (ie a mix of large and small animals) is not
properly addressed. This will have made data interpretation more complicated.
5) The modelling section at the end does not reach a conclusion. In any case, most of the findings
here (defenders will move quickly to avoid bites etc) can be reached without help of the
equations, suggesting that the model does not add any information. I would recommend
removing this section and shortening the paper.
Minor comments
1) The introduction can be improved by adding a better description of aggressive postures in
zebrafish (see Gerlai et al., 2000).
2) Similar comment for the SA and CA game theory models. These can be better described in the
introduction.
3) Line 135 – intuitively it would make more sense to replace “highest” with lowest possible level.
4) Line 138. Use the same tense throughout the paper (the methods switches between past and
present tense).
5) How was dominance assessed in the dyadic pairs (this is not well described).
6) Information starting from line 367 should be in the methods section
7) Line 426. The deceleration by the attacker when approaching the other fish can be a form of
display rather than an attack. Most animals are more likely to display rather than attack since
they risk less damage to themselves. This interpretation will alter the model presented in the last
section, because a lack of impact should not only be based upon acceleration and bites.
8) Line 459. Again, I would interpret this movement as a defender displaying to the other fish to
decrease attack behaviour.
9) Line 472-481. This section is too long and needs to be condensed.
10) The summary end of line 570 (The analysis thus indicates a plausible link between game
theory equilibria, well-known features of fish biomechanics/physiology and the observed long
duration chasing which often concludes zebrafish fights) should be explained in greater detail.

The authors use machine learning to describe the coordinated movements of a pair of zebrafish
during agonistic interactions. They also relate the sequence of interactions to game theory.
Overall, the paper is well written. Though an increased inclusion of quantitative description of
the interactions would enhance the manuscript.
• Can the authors quantitatively define a choice? Is there a species typical acceleration for a
chase? An advance? A bite? . How long do these behavior last? The authors distinguish between
these different behavioral repertoires quantitatively with their tracking software. At the moment,
the descriptions of these aggressive behavior are qualitative not quantitative. Describing these
aggressive behavior quantitatively would have added value and be aligned with the objectives of
the paper as described in lines 56-59. The author do a nice job of this with the splash behavior.
Again quantitatively defining these behavior would enhance the zebrafish ethogram.

Dear Editor
We are grateful to you and the reviewers for the time taken to evaluate
our manuscript. We have implemented several improvements to our manuscript
based on your comments. The biggest changes include a compression of the text
to reduce its length by 15% compared with the earlier submission, a new supple-
mentary figure and analysis designed to rule out potential confounding factors
which reviewer 2 raised, and added sections in the discussion which clarify the
benefits and limitations of our approach. A more detailed line by line response
to the reviewers’ comments will follow below. We are now resubmitting our
manuscript for further consideration in your journal.
Looking forward to your reply
Andres Laan, Marta Iglesias and Gonzalo Polavieja
Detailed responses to the reviewers:
Reviewer 1 wrote:
I think this paper has a few strengths including, the presentation of poten-
tially great ideas and concepts. Similarly I think the information presented may
be useful to others in the field of animal behavior. However, the results and ideas
presented in the introduction and discussion were not well connected. Impor-
tant citations related to these ideas were not presented and a logical argument
was not made effectively.
Responses to reviewer 1:
We thank the reviewer for his compliments on our manuscript. In response
to the deficiencies, we have taken the following steps:
1. The writing of the text has been condensed to improve readability and
make better connections between the various ideas. In particular the text now
occupies around 570 instead of 670 lines (a 15 % cut in size). The various
corrections have been marked in blue in the new manuscript.
2. We have improved referencing to prior work by adding six new references
such as 13,15,16,23,39,40
3. Finally, a new section has been introduced into the discussion in lines 543-
553 along with added supplementary material (section 1.2.2) to further improve
the arguments made in the paper.
Responses to reviewer 2
1) A weakness of this study is that it is based upon whole body movement
without taking into account appendages such fins. It is likely that display
information is lost because of this. Can the resolution of films be increased to
capture this information as well?
Re 1) We agree with the reviewer that our approach does not capture the
full information which zebrafish exchange during conflict. On the other hand,
traditional approaches which enable better monitoring fin movements have their
downsides as well. Namely, the small arenas required to accurately film fins also
constrain the movement of fish and may inhibit the fish from displaying their
1
full locomotor repertoire. The influence of walls further makes it difficult to
disentangle what effect of walls may have on aggressive maneuvers.
Our focus in this study was on developing quantitative measures of locomotor
maneuvers and therefore we needed to use very large arenas where fish could
do most of their fighting away from walls. The large size of the arena prevented
us from monitoring fin displays in our videos. As camera resolutions improve
in the coming years, it may become possible to simultaneously acquire both
types of information and we hope to explore this in future work. The discussion
section now contains a new section which highlights the reviewer’s concerns for
the reader as well (lines 468-474).
2) The text throughout is too long and contains a lot of sentences that are
not required. For example, on page 2 – “Let us consider how much is known
about attack manoeuvres in in zebrafish” can be removed since it does not tell
the reader anything. Likewise the results section contains a lot of discussion
that can be removed. Overall the paper needs rewriting to make it clearer and
more focussed.
Re 2) Based on the reviewer’s recommendation, we have considerably short-
ened the manuscript at several points. Overall, the manuscript has shrunk from
670 to around 570 lines, or by approximately 15%. The numerous edits we have
made to the text are now marked in blue in the text.
3) It is difficult to know whether or not this method can distinguish be-
tween non-aggressive social interaction and aggression. This could be tested
by presenting the results obtained from two fish that exhibit sociality without
attacking each other
Re 3) Our method does in fact enable us to distinguish social behavior (i.e.
schooling) from aggressive behavior. When we place the fish in our arena, they
are temporarily stimulated to behave socially with each other, probably because
of the stress of having been moved to a different tank. Thus, most recording
sessions contain a period (typically the first 10-20 minutes) where the fish are
schooling but not fighting. As can be seen from 2A (first 10 minutes) and Figure
S1 (bottom left and middle panels, first 20 minutes), our classifier is not confused
by this behavior and correctly detects it as non-aggressive behavior. We have
done a more formal analysis of this problem in the supplementary methods
1.2.2 and a new figure S7 has been added to back up our verbal argument with
quantitative analysis.
4) The choice of males that formed the aggressive pairs is not clear. They
should have been equally size-matched since large fish always win fights. This
point is discussed later in the paper, but the confound of using non-equivalent
films (ie a mix of large and small animals) is not properly addressed. This will
have made data interpretation more complicated.
Re 4) In this case, we cannot make use of size matched pairs, because we
were interested in conducting analysis of how resource holding potential effects
fighting times (see also Arnott and Elwood 2009 in references). The most reliable
indicator of resource holding potential in fish is body size and we needed to let
the fish vary in body size in order to better determine the assessment models
used. If we did not allow the size to vary we could not have conducted this
2
analysis. We have followed all recommended methods detailed in Arnott and
Elwood 2009 to take into account size differences in all analysis where size effects
are known to be important.
5) The modeling section at the end does not reach a conclusion. In any case,
most of the findings here (defenders will move quickly to avoid bites etc) can be
reached without help of the equations, suggesting that the model does not add
any information. I would recommend removing this section and shortening the
paper.
Re 5) We thank the reviewer for this comment. This made us realize that we
need to be more explicit in the text about what one gets from the modeling that
intuition alone cannot do. While it is true that some of the conclusions from
the model may be self-evident, we believe that the modeling adds significant
value to the paper. The reviewer writes that it is obvious that defenders will
move quickly to avoid bites. However, this does not explain why the avoidance
maneuvers look very different when we compare the symmetric and asymmetric
phase of the fight. Our models helps clarify why that can arise due to a switch
from a signaling game to a zero-sum dominance maintenance game.
Furthermore, the model is necessary to understand why chases occur at all.
As we point out in the paper, during the chase phase both the winner and the
looser spend a long period of time swimming very rapidly and both parties waste
a lot of energy doing so. From the point of view of traditional game theory, it
is irrational to keep chasing an opponent after the assessment phase has been
completed. Instead, both animals should prefer to do nothing. Our zero-sum
sub-game model explains why doing nothing is in fact not a Nash equilibrium
and why endless chases should occur.
The reviewer points out that our model does not reach a conclusion. We
feel that our model makes several falsifiable predictions and thus cannot be
regarded as not reaching a conclusion. We point out one example to illustrate
our claim. The reviewer himself has made several interesting studies of the
fgfr1a mutant zebrafish. This mutant sometimes lacks scales (Rohner et al 2009
Current Biology) and may thus be more vulnerable to bites. Thus the cost of
bites would be larger for this mutant and one version of our model predicts that
more rapid chases will therefore occur in this mutant. This is a clear and non-
obvious conclusion of our model which can be tested experimentally in future
studies. We have now added a paragraph into the discussion section which
highlight some of these considerations for the reader (lines 543-553).
Minor comments
1) The introduction can be improved by adding a better description of ag-
gressive postures in zebrafish (see Gerlai et al., 2000).
Re 1: We thank the reviewer for the reference which we have added to our
manuscript at several places (see for example line 57-58, 120-124). We have also
refined our description of attack maneuvers at lines 120-1241.
2) Similar comment for the SA and CA game theory models. These can be
better described in the introduction.
Re 2: We have added a supplementary table which provides more informa-
tion on how the models are typically conceptualized in the literature. The main
3
text now points the reader to this table (line 256-257).
3) Line 135 – intuitively it would make more sense to replace “highest” with
lowest possible level.
Re 3: We now use the term high resolution to make this point (line 85).
4) Line 138. Use the same tense throughout the paper (the methods switches
between past and present tense).
Re 4: We thank the reviewer for pointing out this inconsistency and have
homogenized the text to use the past tense where-ever possible (see lines 126-133
for corrections).
5) How was dominance assessed in the dyadic pairs (this is not well de-
scribed).
Re: Dominance in our setups is unusually dynamic and can switch suddenly
at certain points. Our operational definition would be that a fish is counted as
dominant during a time period if it delivers more than 90% of the attacks during
the previous 4 minutes. This is now clarified in the methods (lines 125-128).
6) Information starting from line 367 should be in the methods section
Re 6: We have rearranged the manuscript to take into account that sugges-
tion. The bulk of the description of the method has been moved to the methods
section (lines 175-186). In the main text, the description of the technique has
been considerably shortened.
7) Line 426. The deceleration by the attacker when approaching the other
fish can be a form of display rather than an attack. Most animals are more
likely to display rather than attack since they risk less damage to themselves.
This interpretation will alter the model presented in the last section, because a
lack of impact should not only be based upon acceleration and bites.
Re 7: We agree with the reviewer that this deceleration is a form of display
rather than attack, but we would like point out that according to for example
Gerlai et al 2000 and Oliveira 2011, this maneuver would not be counted as a
display. In these references, the criterion of an attack is large movement speed,
whereas a display requires fin erection, a rigid posture, showing of the flank and
small undulations.
If we look at what the attacker is doing, we see that its orientation is forward
facing (see Figure 4 top panel, it is typically not showing the flank), the velocity
is high (Figure 2E, around the 0.5s mark) and the posture of the attacker does
not seem rigid or undulating in our videos. Nor does our eye typically discern
any fin erection by the attacker at those times (it is rather the defender that
can be occasionally seen to perform fin erection). Therefore, traditional criteria
would not say that the animal is displaying. Having said that, we completely
agree with the reviewer that the aggregate evidence suggests a display-like be-
havior in the attackers conduct and we have expressed similar sentiments at
lines 360-366.
8) Line 459. Again, I would interpret this movement as a defender displaying
to the other fish to decrease attack behaviour.
Re 8: Please see our response to point 7 which addresses similar concerns.
9) Line 472-481. This section is too long and needs to be condensed.
Re 9: We have re-written this section.

10) The summary end of line 570 (The analysis thus indicates a plausible
link between game theory equilibria, well-known features of fish biomechan-
ics/physiology and the observed long duration chasing which often concludes
zebrafish fights) should be explained in greater detail. Which aspects of biome-
chanics are you referring to?
Re 10: We are referring specifically to features of muscle physiology. We
have now made this comparison more specific by referring to it specifically at
line 451.

Comments to the Author(s)
Please note there is one minor but consistent spelling error in the discussion -
please replace "trough" with "through". Thank you.
Response: We have replaced two instances of trough with through in the text. A
global search of the document no longer revealed any more words spelled as trough
so hopefully we caught them all. A thank you to the reviewer for pointing out this
error.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors use machine learning to describe the coordinated movements of a pair
of zebrafish during agonistic interactions. They also relate the sequence of
interactions to game theory.
Overall, the paper is well written. Though an increased inclusion of quantitative
description of the interactions would enhance the manuscript.
• Can the authors quantitatively define a choice? Is there a species typical
acceleration for a chase? An advance? A bite? . How long do these behavior last?
The authors distinguish between these different behavioral repertoires
quantitatively with their tracking software. At the moment, the descriptions of these
aggressive behavior are qualitative not quantitative. Describing these aggressive
behavior quantitatively would have added value and be aligned with the objectives
of the paper as described in lines 56-59. The author do a nice job of this with the
splash behavior. Again quantitatively defining these behavior would enhance the
zebrafish ethogram.

Response: We believe that much of the information that the reviewer is asking for is
already contained in the manuscript, albeit in hidden form. We have modified the
text to try to make this information more explicit. For example, the reviewer asks
for the typical duration of a chase. This information can be read out from plot 2. The
x axis range in panels 2E,F ends at a point which corresponds to the median
duration of an attack in the symmetric and asymmetric phase respectively. We have
amended the legend of figure 2E to highlight this information specifically.
The reviewer asks if there is a stereotypical acceleration associated with a chase.
While we did not compute this explicitly in the original text, figure 2 E,F do provide
the average velocity waveforms of attacks in the two phases. Since acceleration can
be obtained by differentiation of the velocity signal and asymmetric phase attacks
are made up entirely out of chases, this information is again already present in a
latent form. To make this information more explicit, we have added a
supplementary figure S3 where we explicitly plot the average acceleration during an
attack in the two phases of the fight.
The reviewer also states that we do not quantitatively define a choice and asks us if
we could do so. Our manuscript did not make use of the choice concept in the
description of zebrafish fighting. We do not use this term and we are unaware of
other authors using it as a standard descriptive element of zebrafish aggression.
The discussion section of our article makes it clear that small body movements like
fin undulations or small bites cannot currently be monitored automatically with our
software. Hence, a precise quantification of bites or other very small movements
will remain the target of future work.
Finally, we have added a mention of the suggested reference at lines 58 and 84.
Hopefully this citation will facilitate a better connection between the current article
and prior work and we thank the referee for suggesting this reference to us.
