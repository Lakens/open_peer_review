This paper addresses an interesting ecological concept, coexistence of animal dispersed trees,
with a simulation approach. The multi-layer lattice simulation includes both animal movement
and extremely simplified tree demography and with some modification may be of interest to
some. However, there are some problems with the paper in its current form. First, the paper is
difficult to read. For example, the abstract is choppy and repeats the phrase "extreme
biodiversity" twice in the first two sentences. The paper is also strangely disconnected from the
modern literature on tree coexistence. This is a rich body of literature that has increasingly
implicated negative density dependence as an important stabilizing force for coexistence. The
paper's justification for their study and background is overly simplistic and lacks these important
ecological details.
Specific points:
I'm concerned that the simulation does not test coexistence in a reasonable way, since equilibrial
coexistence is difficult to prove in simulations with short time steps. How was the number of time
steps chosen?
What is an "unseen" cell for animal seed dispersers? Does this mean the animal was never
detected in that cell or simply can not move there?
The model assumes animals are "immortal." How might this assumption affect modeling results,
particularly since on evolutionary time scales, animal seed disperser species go extinct faster than
tree species?
What about tree species that are not dispersed by animals? Even though the majority of tropical
tree species are animal-dispersed, many forest still have a considerable number of wind and
gravity dispersed trees.
The authors claim to have explored the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, but this hypothesis requires
conspecific negative density dependence. As far as I can tell, NDD is not present in the model at
all.

This is a neat, simple, model, which illustrates an interesting point, but the two critical
underlying assumptions - that seed-dispersal mutualisms are species-specific, as are movement
patterns of the animals - are not supported by any existing data. Indeed, the first, at least, is
certainly not true, as many dispersal network studies show. I think the model may still be useful
if these assumptions are partly relaxed, but this needs to be discussed.
Why 'unseen' rather than 'unvisited'?

Comments to the Author:
Two reviewers have read and commented on your manuscript. Based on their comments, I'd
recommend that the authors do some more work to tie the model and results they present into
the ecological literature, as the connections (particularly the introduction) are sparse - both
reviewers point out where there is room for extra disussion. Reviewer #2 also notes that there are
some additional scenarios that you might like to consider within the model. FInally, I'd
recommend working on the language in the manuscript - I agree with the reviewers that it is
difficult to pick apart what you intend.

This draft of the paper reads better than the previous version and the authors should be
commended for their revision efforts. However, the paper could still be improved by better
acknowledging previous work in the same area.
Three scientists that have extensively modeled the effects of animal seed dispersal on biodiversity
are Helene Muller-Landau, Ran Nathan and Jonathan Levine. I recommend reading and citing
their work.
The assumption that animals are specialists on one or several species of trees and have distinct
habitat niches also could be discussed a bit more. In reality, most frugivores are generalists and
eat many types of fruit. See Jordi Bascompte's research for examples.
Finally, the conclusions are overstated, for example on line 51 in the discussion: Thus, the species-
specific seed dispersers allow the coexistence and persistence of many tree species.
The simple model makes many assumptions and I am skeptical of how applicable the modeling
results are to reality. The paper would be improved by toning down some of the conclusive
language in the discussion.
Minor comments:
Abstract line 1:
Should read “known for their extreme angiosperm biodiversity”
I strongly disagree with the line: “This factor has rarely been evaluated in terms of tree species
diversity.” Seed dispersal plays a key role in the Jazen-Connell hypothesis and many, many
studies have discussed the role of animal seed dispersers in tropical forest biodiversity
Introduction:
Line 8: Would read better as “Biodiversity in these tropical forests is outstanding” (no need for
word “indeed”)
Line 35: The statement that ”angiosperm trees have recently been found”is incorrect. See Dan
Janzen’s classic paper on the fruits the gomphotheres ate for an example from 1982.
Line 44: Many previous papers have modeled the effect of dispersal on tree biodiversity.

I enjoyed this and think many other people will. It is clearly written and plausible enough to be
interesting. Some of the assumptions are pretty extreme, but they are clearly stated and several of
them are tested within the model. I would have liked to have seen more evidence that animal
movements really are species-specific to the necessary extent, but I don't know of any additional
evidence so this will need to be tested in future.
