The authors described a detailed report of using molecularly imprinted capillary
electrochromatography to analyze sulfamerazine. It can possibly get accepted if the following
issues are addressed.
1. Comparing to reference 32, the authors used a different functional monomer, what is the
reason and advantages? Add a little comparison in the conclusion?
2. On page 2, line 10, the authors state sample requirement for CEC is three order of magnitudes
lower than LC without any reference. I don’t believe this is a sound statement. Detection limit is
3
highly depending on detector types. And it is also not the case that CEC peaks are three times
narrower than LC peaks with same sample injection.
3. Page 2, line 55, “developed for the quantitative determination of SMR in aquatic products.” Is a
little misleading. The fact that all the samples doesn’t have any SMR residues and there is no
quantitative data for the spiked sample.
4. Page 8, after reading it three times, it is still not very clear to me how the method validation
and application part was conducted. Was the calibration curve constructed with just standard
solution or with spiked fish or shrimp sample? What is an aquatic sample? The description feels
like standard solutions were used while the table 4 shows a different picture. Please clarify or
rewrite that part.
5. The using of acronym should be more carefully, make sure they are defined properly before
use (such as MIM) and an acronym name list would be helpful.
6. Page 4, line 52, “the I value (1.67) was lower.” 1.87? possible typo?
7. Page 8, line 27, the equation for plate number calculation should be 16(tR/W)2
8. Page 8, line 37, reproductivity and repeatability is a challenge for in-situ CEC. The authors
mentioned RSD of five repeated measurement for each column. How many columns were made?
Variation between column? Any upward/downward trend in the reproducibility experiments (in
other word, is there any degradation observed)? Limited of life time?
9. It is understandable there is some language challenge, however, some of sections are a little
confusing. It is necessary to go through native-speakers for proofreading.

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
Dear Reviewers,
Thank you very much for your review and comments on our manuscript
( RSOS-190119)!
We have made all the possible corrections, and have revised the manuscript very
carefully according to your kind suggestions.
If there are any other comments concerning this manuscript, please kindly let us know,
and any comments you would give us will be greatly appreciated.
Thank you very much again!
Sincerely yours,
Shili Qin
Our replies are shown in italics.
Reviewer: 1
Thank you very much for your kind comments and good suggestions!
Based on the suggestions, I will answer the questions and modify the article.
Question 1: Please avoid the excessive use of abbreviations, as these made the paper
difficult to read.
Reply 1: Thanks for your query. As for the excessive use of abbreviations in this
manuscript causing your inconvenience, we give our sincerely apologies here. Based on
the suggestion, we have modified the most of abbreviations to full name and reserved
some common and key words, such as SMR, CEC, LOD, SAs, CE, SPE, EGDMA and<U+03B3>
-MAPs.
Question 2: Authors should discuss on the possibility of mixing multiple MIPs phases
specific to different types of sulfamerazine type antibiotics for multiplexed detection.
Reply 2: Thank you for your kind questions. Based on the suggestion, we have discussed
a detailed description on page 8 and 9. The concrete content was showed in 4.3
“Imprinted effect evaluation of molecularly imprinted monolith” including the selective
reason of seven sulfonamides. Meanwhile the data of Rs was supplemented and used to
further evaluate the specific recognition of the imprinted monolith.
“... ... Among them, sulfisoxazole, sulfamethazine and sulfathiazole belonged to
short-acting SAs; sulfamerazine, sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole belonged to
medium-acting SAs ; sulfadimethoxine belonged to long-acting SAs based on the
pharmacological properties and clinical uses.[33] The mixtures with similar structures,
properties and representativeness could offer good explanations to investigate the
recognition mechanism. ... ... (4) The Rs of the adjacent chromatographic peaks was 0.73,
0.98, 2.66, 2.34, 3.62, 1.67 in Figure 9. The baseline separation of five SAs was achieved
with the exception of sulfadimethoxine and sulfisoxazole on the imprinted monolith
because of the different molecular recognition for SAs. The result indicated that the
imprinted monolith could be used for the separation and determination of the different
types of SAs. However the weak separation trends of SAs were on non-imprinted monolith
even under the optimum chromatographic conditions, which was merely a process of the
simple adsorption and elution without the specific selectivity.”
Question 3: Maximum allowable levels of sulfamerazine or recommended guideline
values are missing. Authors should include them and discuss on the adequacy of its
LODs for the determination of such compounds.
Reply 3: Thank you for your kind questions. It is well known that the LOD is important
for the quantitative determination. The recommended guideline values have been
supplemented in 4.4 section on page 9.
“... ...According to Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC/MRL 2-2011) and NO. 235
Announcement of Agriculture Ministry of China, the LOD was lower the maximum
residue limits (0.1 mg kg-1) for SAs and suitable for the quantitative requirements of SMR
in animal-derived food. ... ...”
Reviewer: 2
Thank you very much for your kind comments and good suggestions!
Based on the suggestions, I will answer the questions and modify the article.
Question 1: Comparing to reference 32, the authors used a different functional
monomer, what is the reason and advantages? Add a little comparison in the conclusion?
Reply 1: Thank you for your kind questions. Based on your suggestion, the main reason
of itaconic acid as the functional monomer is the two carboxylate groups structure, which
was not only as a proton donor and a hydrogen bonder forming the stable recognition
cavity but also as a generator of electroosmotic flow. The concrete content was showed
in section 4.1, 4.3 ,4.4 on page 4, 7 and 8.
“... ... Itaconic acid with two carboxylate groups was used as a proton donor and a
hydrogen bonder. In this study, both hydrogenbond (carboxylate of itaconic acid and
amino of SMR) and electrostatic interactions (acid carboxylate of itaconic acid and basic
pyrimidine of SMR) could be formed between the template and the functional monomer
simultaneously. Compared with the molecularly imprinted polymer using methacrylic
acid or 4-vinylpyridine as functional monomer, the imprinted polymer using itaconic acid
with higher charged functionalities presented better separation efficiency and
[28]
recognition ability. ... ...Moreover at this pH value the functional monomers partly
dissociated which not only generated the EOF but also made the hydrogen bonding
between the analytes and the functional groups stronger. ... ...In this study, the proper
functional monomer supported three-dimensional cavities and provided strong
application points for SMR. Although sulfamethazine was used as the template molecular
and methacrylic acid and 4-vinylpyridine as co-functional monomers in He and Zheng’
s research reports, the I value of sulfamethazine (2.89) in this study was slightly below
their values (3.04 and 3.60, respectively), and the I value of SMR (3.34) was
higher.[34,35] ”
Question 2: On page 2, line 10, the authors state sample requirement for CEC is three
order of magnitudes lower than LC without any reference. I don’t believe this is a sound
statement. Detection limit is highly depending on detector types. And it is also not the
case that CEC peaks are three times narrower than LC peaks with same sample injection.
Reply 2: Thanks for your query. As for the vague station causing your inconvenience, we
give our sincerely apologies here. In this section we want to state the small injection
volume of CEC system because of hydrodynamic injection or electrokinetic injection,
rather than the higher detection limit of CEC than LC. The small injection volume could
save the precious biological samples. So we have modified this section and supplement
the reference on page 2, line 8.
“It is important to realize that CEC system do operate with small sample quantities
(nanoliter amounts) and sample vials used for the introduction of the sample only require
microliter quantities (typically = 50 µL), which is quite attractive for the precious
biological samples.[7]”
Question 3: Page 2, line 55, “developed for the quantitative determination of SMR in
aquatic products.” Is a little misleading. The fact that all the samples doesn’t have any
SMR residues and there is no quantitative data for the spiked sample.
Reply 3: Thank you for your kind questions. Based on your suggestion, we have listed the
recovery data in Table 3 and modified the expression on page 2, line 55.
“... ... Finally, the molecularly imprinted monolith coupled with CEC method was
established and applied to the determination of SMR in the aquatic products with adding
standards to the blank, a satisfactory result was obtained.”

Question 4: Page 8, after reading it three times, it is still not very clear to me how the
method validation and application part was conducted. Was the calibration curve
constructed with just standard solution or with spiked fish or shrimp sample? What is an
aquatic sample? The description feels like standard solutions were used while the table 4
shows a different picture. Please clarify or rewrite that part.
Reply 4: Thanks for your query. As for the vague station causing your inconvenience, we
give our sincerely apologies here. In the experiment the calibration curve constructed
with standard solution was complished according the national standard method. And this
section have been rewritten in section 4.6 on page 9.
“The results of the linear calibration curves, recoveries, RSD and LOD were shown in
Table 3. The calibration curve was established by diluting stock solution of SAs at
different concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 10.0, 20.0 mg kg-1). As shown in Table
4, a good linearity for SMR was achieved and the coefficient (R2) was 0.998. The LOD
was 0.040 mg kg-1, which was estimated at a the signal-to-noise ration of three times.
According to Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC/MRL 2-2011) and NO. 235
Announcement of Agriculture Ministry of China, the LOD was lower than the maximum
residue limits (0.1 mg kg-1) for SAs and suitable for the quantitative requirements of SMR
in animal-derived food. To evaluate the applicability of the method, the recoveries for
SMR were then investigated by using the spiked blank fish and shrimps samples with
SMR at three different levels (0.5, 2 and 20 mg kg-1). Five sample replicates of each
concentration were prepared and analyzed in the optimum CEC condition. The results of
the method recoveries ranged from 86.01-105.44%, with RSD values below 7.60%. The
typical chromatograms of the blank fish sample before and after being spiked with SMR
at 3 mg kg-1 were displayed in Figure 10. It can be observed that the retention ability of
the imprinted monolith for trace-level SMR was the strongest than for other impurities
and successfully separated from the matrix compounds. Finally the residue SMR was not
detected in two commercial fish and one commercial shrimps samples using the
developed method, which was in accordance with the detected results of HPLC-DAD
analysis.”
Question 5: The using of acronym should be more carefully, make sure they are defined
properly before use (such as MIM) and an acronym name list would be helpful.
Reply 5: Thanks for your query. As for the excessive use of abbreviations in this
manuscript causing your inconvenience, we give our sincerely apologies here. Based on
your and the other reviewer’s suggestions, we have modified the most of abbreviations to
full name and reserved some common and key words, such as SMR, CEC, LOD, SAs, CE,
SPE, EGDMA and <U+03B3>-MAPs.
Question 6: Page 4, line 52, “the I value (1.67) was lower.” 1.87? possible typo?
Reply 6: Thank you for your kind questions. Based on your question, the incorrect I
value (1.67) have been modified to 1.87 according to the Table 1.
Question 7: Page 8, line 27, the equation for plate number calculation should be
16(tR/W)2
Reply 7: Thank you for your kind questions. Based on your question, the equation for
plate number calculation have been modified.
Question 8: Page 8, line 37, reproductivity and repeatability is a challenge for in-situ
CEC. The authors mentioned RSD of five repeated measurement for each column. How
many columns were made? Variation between column? Any upward/downward trend in
the reproducibility experiments (in other word, is there any degradation observed)?
Limited of life time?
Reply 8: Thank you for your kind questions. The reproductivity and repeatability of the
prepared imprinted monolith was indeed a challenge. The good results were obtained by
optimizing the reaction condition and step-and-repeat operation. Based on your question,
the data of reproductivity have been disposed and showed in section 4.5 on page 9.
“... ... Reproducibility and stability is a critical CEC parameter in the field of preparation
and application of the imprinted monolith. In this study, the results of RSD on the
retention time and Rs using SMR and sulfamethazine as testing sample were showed in
Table 4. As shown in Table 4, the RSD for run to run, day to day, column to column was
in range from 0.71 to 4.21%. Moreover, the separation efficiency of the imprinted
monolith only decreased 3.60% over 200 runs in three consecutive months. These results
demonstrated that the imprinted monolith had good reliability and application. ”
