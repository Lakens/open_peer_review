I have reviewed an earlier submission of this ms and most of my concerns were addressed. I
remain convinced that this experiment is an interesting contribution to our knowledge of
adaptive offspring sex ratio manipulation. I have a few minor comments, mostly about the
writing:
L. 65-67: this is a somewhat simplistic representation of the hare-lynx dynamics. All that is said
here is correct, but it is not the sole driver of the cycle, therefore the wording should be more
cautious.
L. 98-101: Here the wording should be modified to clarify that the female offspring are the focus -
the current wording may suggest an effect on the treated mothers.
L. 113-114: #2 is not presented as an hypothesis - what would be the prediction?
L. 119-122: Please stick to one tense. Other sections of the paper also switch from present to past.
L. 220: I do not understand what "has resulted in the bias disappearing".

Greatly improved and now much clearer - a nice paper with important results. As Ref 2 points
out, sample sizes are small - but results are convincing. Can be published as it stands

publish your manuscript without the end statements. We have included a screenshot example of
the end statements for reference. If you feel that a given heading is not relevant to your paper,
please nevertheless include the heading and explicitly state that it is not relevant to your work.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript before 23-Feb-2019. Please note that the revision deadline
will expire at 00.00am on this date. If you do not think you will be able to meet this date please let
me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
5
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science charge article processing charges for all new
submissions that are accepted for publication. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to
Royal Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers
submitted as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry
(http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/chemistry).
If your manuscript is newly submitted and subsequently accepted for publication, you will be
asked to pay the article processing charge, unless you request a waiver and this is approved by
Royal Society Publishing. You can find out more about the charges at
http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/page/charges. Should you have any queries, please
contact openscience@royalsociety.org.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.

Comments to the Author(s)
I have reviewed an earlier submission of this ms and most of my concerns were
addressed. I remain convinced that this experiment is an interesting contribution to
our knowledge of adaptive offspring sex ratio manipulation.
We thank Marco for his time and effort in reviewing our comments and have
addressed all of them completely.
I have a few minor comments, mostly about the writing:
L. 65-67: this is a somewhat simplistic representation of the hare-lynx dynamics. All
that is said here is correct, but it is not the sole driver of the cycle, therefore the
wording should be more cautious.
This has been changed to a more cautious explanation. “high predation from lynx is
linked to crashes in the snowshoe hare populations”
L. 98-101: Here the wording should be modified to clarify that the female offspring
are the focus - the current wording may suggest an effect on the treated mothers.
We have adjusted the sentence to clarify that offspring are the focus. “Recently, we
conducted a study on laboratory mice that used oral application of dexamethasone, to
experimentally-induce a low stress gestational environment. Dexamethasone when
applied to a mother during late gestation caused physiological changes in the stress
response of her female offspring”
L. 113-114: #2 is not presented as an hypothesis - what would be the prediction?
We have adjusted and added in the prediction. “We propose two hypotheses, 1) that
the combined treatments result in an additive response of decreased offspring sex
ratios, predicted if females are responding independently to each of the environmental
treatments, or 2) that the combined treatment results in a negated effect, predicted if
the response is due to maternal effects and the pre- and post-natal environments
matching.”
L. 119-122: Please stick to one tense. Other sections of the paper also switch from
present to past.
We have adjusted all places that we can find to past tense.
L. 220: I do not understand what "has resulted in the bias disappearing".
This has been changed to “These results are in line with hypothesis 2, that the
offspring sex ratio is a result of maternal effects driven environments and has resulted
in no offspring bias”
