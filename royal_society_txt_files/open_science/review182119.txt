The authors present the synthesis procedure to prepare an epoxy foam using Polysilazane as a
foaming agent. The manuscript is generally well written and with accuracy. However, for me this
is not clear that the use of polysilazane is used for the first time as foaming agent since several
publications using Polysilazane for foam synthesizes have been found. Please explain this or
change to something like "To the best authors knowledge..."

The article entitle "Polysilazane as a new foaming agent to prepare high strength, low density
epoxy foam" was carefully reviewed.
The overall outlay and quality, novelty is not good for publication.
Hence I recommend for its rejection.

will expire at 00.00am on this date. If you do not think you will be able to meet this date please let
me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.

Comments to the Author:
Although one reviewer recommends accept with minor corrections and the other rejection I am
inclined to recommend 'accept with minor correction' since the comments raised is that the
novelty requires clarification. Thus, if the authors are able to describe this more clearly in the
introduction this submission could be acceptable for publication. No comments were raised
regarding it being unscientifically sound.

Dear Dr Laura Smith:
Thank you for reviewing our manuscript RSOS-182119 entitled " Polysilazane as a new

We made careful search in SCI and EI databases for relevant retrieval. We have only found one
patent(SU578283-A), “Refractory cellular concrete mixcontg.specified alumina, phosphate binder
and dimethylcyclosilazane as foaming agent to increase strength”, which is related with silazane
foaming agent, and no any reports about silazane as a foaming for epoxy foams was found.
Actually, there are several references about preparation of silazane foam. However, preparation
of silazane foams is different from that using silazane as foaming agent. In the former, silazane
was used as matrix, and formed foam in the presence of other foaming agent. In our work, epoxy
resin was matrix, which formed epoxy foam in the presence of silazane foaming agent. There is no
report about using silazane as foaming agent to prepare epoxy foam before our work. So we think
our manuscript“Polysilazane as a new foaming agent to prepare high strength, low density epoxy
foam”has novelty.
