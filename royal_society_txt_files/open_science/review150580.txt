The MS titled ‘Selfish mothers indeed’ Resource dependent conflict over extended parental care
in free-ranging dogs’ sets out to test several predictions of the parent- offspring conflict theory. It
is potentially a very interesting question and the dogs seem to be a great species where this could
be manipulated and explored.
In the introduction, the authors nicely lay out their predictions according to the resource-rich and
resource poor environment and how the mothers should behave (lines 89 -106). However, I have
my problems with the experimental design. First, it is very hard to understand what was done
exactly – even though the experimental procedure was adopted from a previous already
published study, the basic information needs to be mentioned here again. Some questions are for
example, are these the same females that were tested in the two experimental conditions?
Observations were done on three consecutive days of the week, what did the animals feed on, on
the other days? Was the amount of food provided adjusted to the group size? How did you
measure the latency? Why latency to first reaction and not to first contact? Second, based on the
information here, the ‘two’ experimental conditions were not counterbalanced e.g. first all groups
were tested with bread. How do we know that the environmental conditions were the same?
Third, body condition is a fairly important measurement. At least some sort of reliability of the
estimations should be provided. Finally and most importantly, how do we know that the
increased conflict we see over meat is not merely the effect of higher motivation? We need some
controls to really test for the effect of the environment. Based on the information that is provided
here, all these females were in a poor environment with very little nutrition available. But to test
for the POC, we also need to have females that are really in a good environment that do not
necessarily ‘need’ the protein rich meat to thrive. This depends on the rest of the environment
about which we get no information. E.g. what are these dogs feeding on during the 4 days they
do not get fed? I assume it is the same for the animals that get the biscuits as it is with the animals
that get the chicken - very little and hardly meat. Thus, I assume that as soon as chicken is
available, motivation is high to fight for it. So you are not really changing the environments
between the two groups, but only the value of the food resource. And here you get really nice
results. But I cannot see that this does test the POC theory. The only data that point into that
direction is the interaction with the mothers’ body condition – but here more information would
be needed to understand this effect.
I would really like to see what the mothers would do, if they are doing fairly well e.g. if they a
provided with food so that their body condition is really quite good – will they then share the
food with their pups?
Minor points: at times the MS is quite repetitive – for example stating several times that ‘dogs are
scavengers’, ‘mostly survive on scraps from humans’
Line 207: I do not understand the logic why the conflict was not just higher but also more intense
for the meat that biscuits.
Line 209 ff: Isn’t the interesting question here as well whether the puppies actually lost gain/or
grew a lot less than – well again, we need some control group.
Potentially this is a very interesting set-up and offers lots of potential. I might have also
misunderstood some part, but then a revision should be helpful.

After the addition of information about the methods used in the study and sub-categories for
methods and results, the manuscript is much clearer now and can be followed better.
Some minor comments:
There is no discussion/conclusion of the results of GLMM model showed in table 1 (significant
negative age effect and positive interaction between age and mother body condition). It would be
clearer to explain what the interaction means in the text (lines 239-243) i.e. “conflict increases with
pup age more intensely for mothers in better body condition” and what this brings to the general
conclusion of the manuscript.
I still did not find information in the ms or ESM on why they chose parametric/non-parametric
statistics and the statistical software used for the tests although the authors claim they added this
information.
5
It needs to be clear that part of the data used in this study has already been published (biscuit
experiment). It is now mentioned in the text, but it needs be to be mentioned it in the figures that
use these data (Figure 2 & Figure 4).

The authors present an interesting study on factors affecting the maternal investment and parent-
offspring conflict in feral dogs. I appreciate the fact they tested predictions from a simple model
for parent-offspring conflict. In this sense, the study has potential to make some nice
contributions to theory. However, I do have some concerns about the study. Specifically, the
study does not describe the social system of the dogs, does not present some critical model
assumptions, and to some extent, lacks taxonomic breadth. I also question the reason for
excluding litter size from the theoretical model and removal of litter size from the statistical
model shown in Table 1.
Missing information
The social system and degree of social interaction among the feral dogs is not clear to me. I think I
figured it out by the time I read through the suckling experiment. However, it should be clear up
front. Some discussion of the social system, including the mating system (see comment about
Trivers & Willard below), is warranted in the introduction. Along these lines, the authors state
that ‘juveniles often stay with the mother even after weaning (line 70).’ Do these juveniles
provide alloparental care? To what extent do they compete for resources with the next litter?
These questions are relevant as the answers might influence my interpretation of the results.
Model assumptions
The presentation of the model would be much improved if assumptions were discussed. For
example, from what I can tell, the model assumes that male and female offspring are treated
equally. For simplicity, I am fine with this assumption. However, given theory regarding
differential allocation of resources to male and female offspring (Trivers & Willard), it is worth
6
justifying that assumption. Additionally, the authors have a significant interaction between
mother condition and age of pups. Differences in maternal condition are predicted to impact the
allocation of resources to male and female offspring in polygynous species. This issue should be
addressed.
Greater breadth
Although the authors cite papers on different species and provide some discussion late in the
paper, some discussion relating the social system and types of care (parental, vs. alloparental) of
feral dogs to that of wild dogs (e.g. African wild dogs) would be informative and provide a
broader context.
Litter size
In mammals, litter size plays an important role in the allocation of resources to and growth of
offspring (e.g. Konig et al. 1988; Mappes et al. 1995; Anderson & Linnell 1997; Derocher & Stirling
1998; Anderson et al. 2011). Female investment may also be primed based on her litter size.
From what I can tell, the size of litters was not included as a predictor variable in the authors’
theoretical model. If so, I am concerned about the utility of the predictive model. And, despite the
fact that litters varied in size (1-7 puppies per mother), LS was not included in Table 1. I
understand that LS was not significant and thus, was excluded from the model in Table 1. I
appreciate that the authors used AIC for this. However, I wonder if LS should be removed given
that it is a logical and in my mind, clear a priori hypothesis. I expect a priori that maternal
investment (and conflict) would be influenced by the size of her current litter. My understanding
of ‘reduced model’ approaches is that one does not remove factors that are in a priori hypotheses.
In the end, this is my greatest concern about the paper.
Minor comments
Line 61: Not a fan of the use of ‘etc.’
Throughout: Check for consistency of terms (e.g. pups vs. puppies)
Line 82: Is this consistent across neighborhoods or between cities? My point is that foods eaten
locally may vary, resulting in different foods available to feral dogs.
Line 97: Avoid anthropomorphic terms. The term ‘hope’ is associated with humans. Also lines
114,
Page 5: Predictions are clear. However, it seems that they should stem from an existing body of
literature on trade-offs between current and future reproductive success. These ideas are not
novel, as they go back to Lack’s work in the 1960s.
Line 175: Is this really a random selection process? I don’t question the quality of the
observations. As a field biologist, I appreciate that random selection is tough in most field
studies. However, I am not certain that a random selection process occurred and thus, should not
be sold as such.
Line 183: 16 groups. Are these animals social? If so, what is the mean and range of group sizes.
This relates to my main concern about the social system.
Line 240: There is a significant age*MBC interaction. Therefore, there is not an age effect.
7
Figures and legends
Figure legend 1: I know the term F’ is in the model description. However, it would be helpful if it
were defined again in the figure legend. Similarly, in line 532, does F’ > F indicate or higher
quality food? It would also be helpful if the y and x values were defined or labeled in the figure.

label_comment_5
(1) Authors state that a previous study indicated that litter size was not an important predictor of
conflict (Paul et al. 2014). This should be clearly stated in the paper.
(2) Use of ‘hope’ and ‘peacefully’. The word ‘hope’ is still in the ms (line 98). The authors state
that peacefully means ‘without showing aggression’. They should use this phrase instead of
peacefully.
(3) Line 74: Compulsive cooperative hunters. Do the authors mean ‘obligate?’
(4) Line 249-255: The authors wrote the following in their cover letter:
Line 240: There is a significant age*MBC interaction. Therefore, there is not an age effect.We have
reworded this section. Please see the lines 249-255. Pup age has significant effect on conflict
however pup age*MBC together shows more significant effect on conflict. The conflict increases
with pup age more intensely for mothers in poor body condition.
My understanding is that their interpretation of the main effect of age is wrong. If there is a
statistically significant interaction, one does not look at the main effect.
Also, I am of the mindset that statistical comparisons are significant (not highly significant).

General comments
This manuscript investigates parent-offspring conflict (POC) in free-ranging dogs
during extended parental care. Conflict over resource rich food is then hypothesized
to be linked to differences in sociality among free-ranging dogs and their ancestors.
The idea to investigate how conflict over care affects sociality is interesting and the
approach is ambitious, including experimental data and theoretical modeling. The
study focuses on central topics in behavioral ecology: cooperation, conflict and
parental care.
In general the manuscript is not clearly written and it is very difficult to follow. This is
particularly so for the methods and the results, where there is a lot of missing
information on how the experiments and statistical analyses were conducted (sample
sizes missing, response variables not specified, statements of results not referring to
any value, test or table). Additionally, results and methods sections are not specified
but all mixed-up. Interpretations and conclusions also follow some results instead of
being in the discussion section.
In the introduction and discussion there are several statements without references,
repeated information or vague sentences, plus information for the manuscript on
current-future reproduction trade-off is missing. The discussion is missing
comparisons with the wild relatives of dogs particularly because they claim that
domestication was favored by conflict over resource-rich food. Do more social wild
relatives show a similar/ different pattern in POC?
Some clarifications and information are needed:
Add information in the introduction about what predicts parent-offspring conflict
(offspring age, mother age, resource availability+.) which is necessary to understand
the predictors used in the models afterwards.
Add a methods section where theoretical approach, experimental approach and
statistical analyses are clearly specified (in subsections if necessary), which is
separated from the results section where only the results of the experiment and
comparisons with theoretical model are mentioned.
It is not clear how the experiment was done (duration of observation, treatments+).
Mother age has strong effect on the residual reproduction value and on the current-
future reproduction trade-off. Older mothers should invest more in current
reproduction while young mothers should invest less, as young mothers have higher
probability to reproduce again. Why was mother age not included in the theoretical
and experimental analyses? Was there any difference in mother’s age for the families
included in the experiment?
It needs to be justified why in the theoretical models litter size is not taken into
account but it is so for the experiment analyses.
The response variables need to be clearly specified in the methods. The use of
sometimes parametric and sometimes non-parametric tests needs to be justified (i.e.
specify if normality was tested prior to analyses). Sample sizes need to be specified
for each test. The statistical software used for the analyses also needs to be
mentioned.
Although the authors claim that POC in high rich conditions explains differences in
sociality and promoted domestication in free ranging dogs respect, there is no
information on any of the wild relatives in the discussion that would backup a bit this
conclusion.
Specific comments:
L24-25: Change “in the facultatively social free-ranging dogs” to “facultatively social
species” to make it the abstract more general.
L25-26: Add if this statement refers only to free ranging dogs or mammals in general.
L26-28: Add something like “in this study we investigated whether resource quality+”
L28: Add “theoretical” before model.
L32: Lifetime reproductive success was not measured in this study, only body
condition of mothers and conflict over food.
L36: change “in” for “about” and “conditions” by “food”.
L47-52: Provide references to the text.
L54: Too many pronouns, difficult to know what “their” refers to. Change “so that she
can ensure” to “ensuring”
L54: Change “their” to “the”
L54: Add “of their current offspring” after “survival”
L68: Vague statement, indicate for which behavioral ecology questions dogs are a
good model species.
L70-72 and L81: rephrase, unnecessary repetition of scavenger behavior of dogs.
L76-79: Add reference.
L84: Add reference.
L88: Add reference.
L100: is it first litter or current litter?
L100-102: explain this assumption better; it seems that in resource rich environment
you expect litters to get more, equal or less food than in resource poor environment.
L108: add the section “Methods”
L110: do you mean response variable?
L120-168: Give more details on the theoretical models.
L174: are free-ranging dogs seasonal breeders?
L175: add “from” after “spanned”
L172-178: add information on mother age as well
L180-183: Give some information on the experimental protocol even when it is partly
the same as in Paul et al 2014. It is not clear whether dogs received both chicken
and biscuit treatment in this experiment or only chicken and data from an earlier
study was used as biscuit comparison. In case data from another study was used,
the study needs to be cited.
L181-183: Where groups separated between the two conditions? Or each group
received both treatments? Was reaction to biscuits not measured again?
L183-187: specify with more details the different behaviors and add reference of the
video in supplementary material. What was recorded? the time doing each behavior
or the number of times a behavior was observed? How long did the experiment last?
L192: Add section “Results”
L192: 79% of what?
L193-210: these tests are done on average values per group? Justify why the
different tests are used. The experimental design is not explained in detail in the
methods and it is not possible to judge whether the statistically approach is ok, but it
is likely that a GLMM analyses would be necessary taking into account the repeated
measurements per group (several days and treatments?). A table summarizing the
results for each variable tested would make it easier to follow.
L236: higher slope for meat treatment based on which test?
L 192-295: Results and methods all mixed-up. Separate the information between
methods (what you did, how and why) and results (test outputs).
L223-227: Add information on the test result. This statement refers to table1? Specify
in which direction the effects go. Odd that conflict decreases with pup age (table 1).
L 219-223: Explain why backward model selection and not AIC model selection was
used. What test was used to discard a factor, likelihood ratio test? What was the
sample size for this test and the rest?
L262-266: this is an interpretation of the results and should go to the discussion
section.
L268-278: this paragraph should go to the “methods” section
L292-295: Interpretation of results should be mentioned in the discussion section.
L303-317: Repetition of what was said in the introduction, mainly interpreting a
previous study. Discussion could start with a summary of the main findings (L317-
320) and then start interpreting the results of this study.
L327 and L331: add reference
L322-378: Final conclusion is not supported by any reference or data. Add paragraph
comparing parental care, conflict+ among free-ranging dogs and their wild relatives
to backup final conclusion (372-378).
L 509-512: what means MBC?

Paul et al Response to Reviewers’ Comments
Reviewer 1:
The MS titled ‘Selfish mothers indeed’ Resource dependent conflict over extended parental
care in free-ranging dogs’ sets out to test several predictions of the parent- offspring conflict
theory. It is potentially a very interesting question and the dogs seem to be a great species
where this could be manipulated and explored.
We would like to thank the reviewer for appreciating the premise of our work.
In the introduction, the authors nicely lay out their predictions according to the resource-rich
and resource poor environment and how the mothers should behave (lines 89 -106).
Thank you.
However, I have my problems with the experimental design. First, it is very hard to
understand what was done exactly – even though the experimental procedure was adopted
from a previous already published study, the basic information needs to be mentioned here
again.
We had not added a more detailed protocol of the experiment in order to reduce the length
of the manuscript. However, we have now done so, and we hope this answers the questions
raised by the reviewer. We are also providing the answers to the specific questions raised
by the reviewer below.
Some questions are for example, are these the same females that were tested in the two
experimental conditions?
No, two different sets of females were used for the two conditions. The biscuit experiment
has been published already, and we used this data to compare with the meat experiment.
Observations were done on three consecutive days of the week, what did the animals feed on,
on the other days?
As we have already mentioned, these dogs are scavengers. We fed them biscuits/meat only
in small quantities, twice for three days of the week. They were free to forage at all other
times, and fed on the usual food that dogs feed on – rice, bread, vegetables, animal excreta,
fish and meat bones or any other scrap available. Details would be available in Bhadra et
al 2015, to be published in Ethology Ecology and Evolution.
Was the amount of food provided adjusted to the group size?
Yes, each group was provided with number of pieces equal to the group size. We have
clarified this in the methods now.
How did you measure the latency? Why latency to first reaction and not to first contact?
The latency to first reaction was the time taken by any of the dogs to react to the food. So
we measured this by taking the time at which the food piece was given to be zero and
marking time till any one dog reacted.
Second, based on the information here, the ‘two’ experimental conditions were not
counterbalanced e.g. first all groups were tested with bread. How do we know that the
environmental conditions were the same?
We tested dogs from the IISER Kolkata campus and neighbourhoods in Kolkata, selecting
areas with similar resources. Both sets of dogs were tested in the same areas. Given that we
are sampling from a natural population, this was the only measure we could take.
Third, body condition is a fairly important measurement. At least some sort of reliability of
the estimations should be provided.
We have now added snapshots from the videos for reference. Please note that the same
method of estimation was used in Paul e al 2014.
Finally and most importantly, how do we know that the increased conflict we see over meat
is not merely the effect of higher motivation? We need some controls to really test for the
effect of the environment. Based on the information that is provided here, all these females
were in a poor environment with very little nutrition available. But to test for the POC, we
also need to have females that are really in a good environment that do not necessarily ‘need’
the protein rich meat to thrive. This depends on the rest of the environment about which we
get no information. E.g. what are these dogs feeding on during the 4 days they do not get fed?
I assume it is the same for the animals that get the biscuits as it is with the animals that get
the chicken - very little and hardly meat. Thus, I assume that as soon as chicken is available,
motivation is high to fight for it . So you are not really changing the environments between
the two groups, but only the value of the food resource. And here you get really nice results.
But I cannot see that this does test the POC theory. The only data that point into that direction
is the interaction with the mothers’ body condition – but here more information would be
needed to understand this effect.
We would like to point out that given that the environmental conditions are the same for
both the conditions, we can ask whether the mothers would have higher motivation to fight
(selfish) or try to provide for the pups (altruistic). This is the original premise of the
experiment. We have already demonstrated that POC exists, and the motivation for this
work was to test if the conflict would override the nutritional requirements of the pups
from the mother’s perspective. The dogs are not starving, they have access to resources, but
the meat is a more lucrative resource, and important for both the mother and the pups.
Hence if the mothers show increased conflict, she would benefit more, which could
translate into higher lifetime fitness for her – of course, she does not have to “understand”
this, but evolutionarily, it would be a stable strategy.
I would really like to see what the mothers would do, if they are doing fairly well e.g. if they
a provided with food so that their body condition is really quite good – will they then share
the food with their pups?
We have already started carrying out a set of experiments to ask this same question, and
would need two pup seasons to get enough data to answer this.
at times the MS is quite repetitive – for example stating several times that ‘dogs are
scavengers’, ‘mostly survive on scraps from humans’
We have taken care of this now.
Line 207: I do not understand the logic why the conflict was not just higher but also more
intense for the meat that biscuits.
In the case of biscuits, the pups fed more, on the whole, but the mother ate more through
conflict. In the case of biscuits, the mothers ate more on the whole, this means that they did
not just step up conflict to get some more food, but increased the conflict levels greatly, so
that the pups hardly got access to the food. Thus the conflict is more intense.
Line 209 ff: Isn’t the interesting question here as well whether the puppies actually lost
gain/or grew a lot less than – well again, we need some control group.
We did not want to comment on this as for the puppies actual weights might be more
important, and we did not have permission to handle them for weighing.
Potentially this is a very interesting set-up and offers lots of potential. I might have also
misunderstood some part, but then a revision should be helpful.
We hope the revised version meets with your approval.
Reviewer 2
This manuscript investigates parent-offspring conflict (POC) in free-ranging dogs
during extended parental care. Conflict over resource rich food is then hypothesized
to be linked to differences in sociality among free-ranging dogs and their ancestors.
The idea to investigate how conflict over care affects sociality is interesting and the
approach is ambitious, including experimental data and theoretical modeling. The
study focuses on central topics in behavioral ecology: cooperation, conflict and
parental care.
We thank the reviewer for this positive comment about our work.
In general the manuscript is not clearly written and it is very difficult to follow. This is
particularly so for the methods and the results, where there is a lot of missing
information on how the experiments and statistical analyses were conducted (sample
sizes missing, response variables not specified, statements of results not referring to
any value, test or table). Additionally, results and methods sections are not specified
but all mixed-up. Interpretations and conclusions also follow some results instead of
being in the discussion section.
We have now provided more detailed methods. However, we would prefer to keep the main
structure of the manuscript unaltered, as we feel this ensures better flow of logic.
In the introduction and discussion there are several statements without references,
repeated information or vague sentences, plus information for the manuscript on
current-future reproduction trade-off is missing. The discussion is missing
comparisons with the wild relatives of dogs particularly because they claim that
domestication was favored by conflict over resource-rich food. Do more social wild
relatives show a similar/ different pattern in POC?
We have provided references wherever available. There have been no studies, to the best of
our knowledge, on POC in other canids. Hence we could not provide comparisons with
wild canids in this manuscript.
Some clarifications and information are needed:
Add information in the introduction about what predicts parent-offspring conflict
(offspring age, mother age, resource availability+.) which is necessary to understand
the predictors used in the models afterwards.
We hope the revised version will resolve this issue.
Add a methods section where theoretical approach, experimental approach and
statistical analyses are clearly specified (in subsections if necessary), which is
separated from the results section where only the results of the experiment and
comparisons with theoretical model are mentioned.
As mentioned above, we would like to keep the structure of the manuscript unaltered, if the
Editor allows us to. This paper actually describes three linked pieces of work, and we felt
that putting all the methods together might confuse the readers. Hence we used the one-
question-at-a-time mode of writing this paper. We hope that the reviewer would agree with
this style of writing and allow us to keep the sections intact. We have separated the
experiments into methods and results sections for better understanding.
It is not clear how the experiment was done (duration of observation, treatments+).
We have provided the details in the manuscript, and separated methods and results.
Mother age has strong effect on the residual reproduction value and on the currentfuture
reproduction trade-off. Older mothers should invest more in current
reproduction while young mothers should invest less, as young mothers have higher
probability to reproduce again. Why was mother age not included in the theoretical
and experimental analyses? Was there any difference in mother’s age for the families
included in the experiment?
We were working with a natural population, and we did not know the ages of all the
mothers. Hence we could not use mother’s age as a parameter. However, since the trend of
conflict was same for all the mothers, and variation in conflict was not significant within
them, we can reliably conclude that the age of the mother would not affect this result
greatly.
It needs to be justified why in the theoretical models litter size is not taken into
account but it is so for the experiment analyses.
Please note that we have compared the theoretical models with the data for conflict, which
has not been scaled by litter size.
The response variables need to be clearly specified in the methods. The use of
sometimes parametric and sometimes non-parametric tests needs to be justified (i.e.
specify if normality was tested prior to analyses). Sample sizes need to be specified
for each test. The statistical software used for the analyses also needs to be
mentioned.
We have done so now.
Although the authors claim that POC in high rich conditions explains differences in
sociality and promoted domestication in free ranging dogs respect, there is no
information on any of the wild relatives in the discussion that would backup a bit this
conclusion.
Unfortunately, there is no data available from other canids, and we have given this as a
speculation, which would need further investigation.
Specific comments:
L24-25: Change “in the facultatively social free-ranging dogs” to “facultatively social
species” to make it the abstract more general.
L25-26: Add if this statement refers only to free ranging dogs or mammals in general.
L26-28: Add something like “in this study we investigated whether resource quality+”
L28: Add “theoretical” before model.
L32: Lifetime reproductive success was not measured in this study, only body
condition of mothers and conflict over food.
L36: change “in” for “about” and “conditions” by “food”.
We have made some of the changes as suggested, and we hope that the abstract is now
more general.
L47-52: Provide references to the text.
L54: Too many pronouns, difficult to know what “their” refers to. Change “so that she
can ensure” to “ensuring”
L54: Change “their” to “the”
L54: Add “of their current offspring” after “survival”
We feel that the revised statement will be more lucid.
L68: Vague statement, indicate for which behavioral ecology questions dogs are a
good model species.
We have done so now.
L70-72 and L81: rephrase, unnecessary repetition of scavenger behavior of dogs.
We have done so now.
L76-79: Add reference.
Reference has been added.
L84: Add reference.
We have reworded the two sentences for which the references are common.
L88: Add reference.
Reference added.
L100: is it first litter or current litter?
It is current litter, we are sorry for the error.
L100-102: explain this assumption better; it seems that in resource rich environment
you expect litters to get more, equal or less food than in resource poor environment.
We have edited the sentence.
L108: add the section “Methods”
As we have already stated, we would like to keep this style of writing if the reviewer and
editor agree.
L110: do you mean response variable?
No, we mean a random variable Y.
L120-168: Give more details on the theoretical models.
We would be happy to provide more details if there are any specific questions. To the best
of our knowledge, we have provided all details.
L174: are free-ranging dogs seasonal breeders?
Yes. They mate mostly during the months of August and September, though a secondary
mating period around March and April is also observed. These experiments were carried
out during the winter months, which is the primary pup season.
L175: add “from” after “spanned”
We have done so now.
L172-178: add information on mother age as well
As stated above, we don’t have this information since the dogs were randomly selected
from a natural population.
L180-183: Give some information on the experimental protocol even when it is partly
the same as in Paul et al 2014. It is not clear whether dogs received both chicken
and biscuit treatment in this experiment or only chicken and data from an earlier
study was used as biscuit comparison. In case data from another study was used,
the study needs to be cited.
We have added a detailed protocol
L181-183: Where groups separated between the two conditions? Or each group
received both treatments? Was reaction to biscuits not measured again?
We hope the revised version is now clear.
L183-187: specify with more details the different behaviors and add reference of the
video in supplementary material.
An ethogram of the behaviours has now been added in supplementary material (ESM1
Table 3).
What was recorded? the time doing each behavior
or the number of times a behavior was observed? How long did the experiment last?
We have added more information.
L192: Add section “Results”
We have added this.
L192: 79% of what?
We hope this is now clear in the edited version.
L193-210: these tests are done on average values per group? Justify why the
different tests are used. The experimental design is not explained in detail in the
methods and it is not possible to judge whether the statistically approach is ok, but it
is likely that a GLMM analyses would be necessary taking into account the repeated
measurements per group (several days and treatments?). A table summarizing the
results for each variable tested would make it easier to follow.
We hope that the ESM 3 and revised methods section will make this easier to understand.
L236: higher slope for meat treatment based on which test?
This is a qualitative statement, based on the pattern of the data, not the slopes.
L 192-295: Results and methods all mixed-up. Separate the information between
methods (what you did, how and why) and results (test outputs).
We hope that the ESM 3 will make this part more clear.
L223-227: Add information on the test result. This statement refers to table1? Specify
in which direction the effects go. Odd that conflict decreases with pup age (table 1).
The GLMM related statements refer to Table 1. Detailed test results are supplied in the
newly included supplementary material (ESM 3). The conflict is not decreasing with pup
age which is also evident in Figure 4. Since a log-link function has been used for the
GLMM, the estimate of the fixed effect 'Age' comes out as negative.
L 219-223: Explain why backward model selection and not AIC model selection was
used. What test was used to discard a factor, likelihood ratio test? What was the
sample size for this test and the rest?
All necessary information as well as the detailed steps of the backward model selection
procedure using the AIC values are now supplied in ESM 3.
L262-266: this is an interpretation of the results and should go to the discussion
section.
We feel that summing up the main conclusion at the end of the results for a particular
experiment would help the readers to understand the results better, and would thus prefer
to retain this statement here.
L268-278: this paragraph should go to the “methods” section
This is a separate study linked to the POC experiment, and hence the findings are relevant.
Once again, we hope that the reviewer would agree with this style of writing and allow us
to keep the sections intact.
L292-295: Interpretation of results should be mentioned in the discussion section.
Here again, we have summed up the main conclusion at the end of the results.
L303-317: Repetition of what was said in the introduction, mainly interpreting a
previous study. Discussion could start with a summary of the main findings (L317-
320) and then start interpreting the results of this study.
We have edited this.
L327 and L331: add reference
The reference is given at the end of the next sentence, which is also about this study.
L322-378: Final conclusion is not supported by any reference or data. Add paragraph
comparing parental care, conflict+ among free-ranging dogs and their wild relatives
to backup final conclusion (372-378).
This is a speculation, the idea partly supported by Axelsson et al 2013 and would need
further studies to be confirmed. No information is available about the ancestors of dogs,
and most understanding of dog domestication is based on speculation emerging from
available data on present day dogs and wolves.
L 509-512: what means MBC?
Mother’s body condition. We have added this in the text and Table legend.

mments to the Author(s)
authors present an interesting study on factors affecting the maternal investment and parent-
pring conflict in feral dogs. I appreciate the fact they tested predictions from a simple model
parent-offspring conflict. In this sense, the study has potential to make some nice
tributions to theory.
thank the Reviewer for appreciating our work and hope that the revised version meets with
her approval.
wever, I do have some concerns about the study. Specifically, the study does not describe the
ial system of the dogs, does not present some critical model assumptions, and to some extent,
ks taxonomic breadth.
hope that the answers provided to the queries will be found satisfactory by the reviewer.
so question the reason for excluding litter size from the theoretical model and removal of
r size from the statistical model shown in Table 1.
have run the generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) considering the conflict and
peration as response variables; litter size, pup age and mother’s body condition (MBC) as
d effects; group identity as random effects. We have started with the full model and have
n that the three way interaction (litter size*pup age*MBC) has so significant effect on
flict and have run the model again after dropping that term. We have checked that AIC
ue has also reduced after dropping that term, claiming our second model better than the
vious one.
er size also had no significant effect on conflict and dropping the term has reduced the
C value. Finally the pup age and pup age*MBC were showing significant effect on conflict
we have presented these final results only in Table 1. For the entire GLMM analysis
ase see the ESM 4.
sing information
social system and degree of social interaction among the feral dogs is not clear to me. I think
gured it out by the time I read through the suckling experiment. However, it should be clear
front. Some discussion of the social system, including the mating system (see comment about
vers & Willard below), is warranted in the introduction. Along these lines, the authors state
‘juveniles often stay with the mother even after weaning (line 70).’ Do these juveniles
vide alloparental care? To what extent do they compete for resources with the next litter?
se questions are relevant as the answers might influence my interpretation of the results.
have added some more information about the social behaviour of the free-ranging dogs
es 73-76). We feel that the focus of this paper is to understand if parent-offspring conflict
r food is influenced by the quality of the food, and hence we did not discuss the social
amics of the dogs in detail in the introduction. However, this is relevant to be discussed in
t of our results, and we have done so in the Discussion. Please see lines 327-343.
del assumptions
presentation of the model would be much improved if assumptions were discussed. For
mple, from what I can tell, the model assumes that male and female offspring are treated
ally. For simplicity, I am fine with this assumption. However, given theory regarding
erential allocation of resources to male and female offspring (Trivers & Willard), it is worth
ifying that assumption. Additionally, the authors have a significant interaction between
ther condition and age of pups. Differences in maternal condition are predicted to impact the
cation of resources to male and female offspring in polygynous species. This issue should be
ressed.
did not assume differential allocation based on the sex of the offspring, primarily because
observations on parental care and alloparental care in the free-ranging dogs have
ealed no bias in allocation of care to male or female offspring (Paul et al 2014). The
oretical model was derived from our previous experiment with biscuits, where we did not
erve any interaction between MBC and conflict.
ater breadth
hough the authors cite papers on different species and provide some discussion late in the
er, some discussion relating the social system and types of care (parental, vs. alloparental) of
l dogs to that of wild dogs (e.g. African wild dogs) would be informative and provide a
ader context.
can understand that the reviewer would like us to discuss the dogs in more detail with
pect to other canids in the introduction. However, we feel that this might dilute the focus of
paper, if brought in in the Introduction, rather than the Discussion. We would also like to
nt out that while comparing the dogs to wolves is highly relevant, comparing them to
ican wild dogs in particular might not be of great significance, as the two are
onomically further apart than the wolves and the free-ranging dogs.
er size
mammals, litter size plays an important role in the allocation of resources to and growth of
pring (e.g. Konig et al. 1988; Mappes et al. 1995; Anderson & Linnell 1997; Derocher &
ling 1998; Anderson et al. 2011). Female investment may also be primed based on her litter
.
m what I can tell, the size of litters was not included as a predictor variable in the authors’
oretical model. If so, I am concerned about the utility of the predictive model. And, despite
fact that litters varied in size (1-7 puppies per mother), LS was not included in Table 1. I
erstand that LS was not significant and thus, was excluded from the model in Table 1. I
reciate that the authors used AIC for this. However, I wonder if LS should be removed given
it is a logical and in my mind, clear a priori hypothesis. I expect a priori that maternal
estment (and conflict) would be influenced by the size of her current litter. My understanding
reduced model’ approaches is that one does not remove factors that are in a priori
otheses. In the end, this is my greatest concern about the paper.
your convenience here we want to mention that we have used the generalized linear
ed-effects model (GLMM) analysis to examine how conflict/cooperation shown by the
ther might depend on her litter size, age of the pups (in weeks) and the mothers' body
dition. Here the conflict and cooperation (response variables) were determined on the basis
uccess (food eaten) and failure (food not eaten) for each of the experimental trials (food
ered) and we have used the Binomial family of distributions for the GLMM. The three
ameters, i.e, litter size, age of the pups in weeks and the mothers' body condition, were
sidered as the fixed effects while the identity of the groups was taken as the random effect.
started with the full model, i.e., with all possible two-way interactions and the three-way
raction among the fixed effects. The three-way interaction was non-significant; we then
uced the model using standard protocol of backward selection method (ESM 4) and ended
with the optimal model, the result of which is described in Table 1.
m GLMM we have seen that litter size has no effect on conflict. Pup age and mother’s
y condition (MBC) are the two most important parameters that have significant effect on
flict. Thus the size of litters was not included as a predictor variable in the theoretical
del.
r previous study on POC biscuit experiment (Paul et al. 2014) has also claimed that the
ount of conflict shown by the mother towards her own pups does not depend on her litter

s is true that foods eaten may vary locally resulting in different foods available to free-
ging dogs. For example free-ranging dogs defending a meat shop or fish shop as their
jor food source might get higher protein food than others although they have to face
paratively higher amount of competition. But these types of protein rich food sources are
a frequent food source for the free-ranging dog population. However in general they have
cavenge hard to get sufficient amount of protein for their physical needs. Also, please note

feel that the premise for this model has been laid out in the Introduction of the paper,

de-offs between parental investment per individual brood and clutch size. We are testing
