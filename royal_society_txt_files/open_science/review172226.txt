In this study, the authors showed the participants GBR imagery using a VR system, and asked
them eight questions related to aesthetics of the imagery. Then they performed statistical analysis
to correlate their aesthetic judgments with the features of the imagery. The participants were
from three groups (marine scientists, experienced divers, and ordinary people), and statistical
analysis was performed to determine the effect of experience on the aesthetic judgement. This, in
my view, is the main contribution of the paper.
There are number of other claims made in the paper that are not substantiated. For example, the
title is "Using virtual reality to support conservation of ecosystem services", but there is data in
the paper to support this claim. It is a big jump from being able to model aesthetic judgments to
be able to support conservation of ecosystem services. Another example is the claim "The results
of this study clearly show the benefits of using VR to elicit aesthetic information from scientists
and the general public." Where is this shown? The authors used VR in their experiment. But there
is no other comparison point. Is it better than using just images? Is it better than real immersion
in the environment? Without any point of comparison, it is difficult to assess whether VR is
beneficial or not.
My suggestion is to revise the title and the discussion section to limit to what is actually shown in
the study.

The use of VR to study aesthetic judgments of the GBR among different participant groups is
novel and interesting. The exploratory approach taken here yielded interesting and useful results.
The main issues I saw while reading were mostly about lack of reporting method details, and a
desire to know more about how the authors interpret the group-level differences (and
similarities) for both theoretical development and for practical application to ecological
conservation. My notes are listed below:
Abstract – it would be useful to include a note that there were not group level differences as
expected, as this is something readers would be curious about when reading this paper.
Pg. 6 – Can the authors provide details on the linkage method used and any justification if
possible?
Pg. 6 – Can the authors provide just a sentence or two summarizing how Ref. 13 hypothesized
these key attributes?
Pg. 6 – Please provide details in the methods how exactly experimental design (a) viewed at least
one image from the 3 clusters (pristine, damaged, degraded); (b) order of images was varied
across participants; and (c) each image was used for elicitation approximately the same # of
times.
Pg. 7 – It is important to report details about the training image used across participants because
it likely created an anchor on which subsequent judgments during the aesthetics interview were
based.
Pg. 9 – The certain Yes/No responses made up an overall 76% of responses, but were the %s high
for each group? The subsequent analysis rests on these certain responses, so knowing each
group’s agreement level would be useful.
Related to the point above, it would be useful to discuss a bit more about the group-level
differences in certainty Yes/No aesthetic judgments. Although there is similarity in the results in
what predicts aesthetic judgment across groups, this is for images agreed upon with certainty in
terms of their aesthetic value. Why is there less agreement in the citizen group and marine
scientist group compared to the experienced diver group? What implications do these group-
level agreement differences have for ecological conservation?

which we are very grateful.
Below we provide a detailed description of the changes we made in response to each
comment and suggestion. The major edits on the revised manuscript text are highlighted in blue
and reported in this letter.
We hope that our edits meet your expectations.
Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you need further information.
Yours faithfully,
Julie Vercelloni, on behalf of the authors.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer 1
<U+F0B7> There are number of other claims made in the paper that are not substantiated. For
example, the title is "Using virtual reality to support conservation of ecosystem
services", but there is data in the paper to support this claim. It is a big jump from being
able to model aesthetic judgments to be able to support conservation of ecosystem
services.
We agree with the reviewer that our modelling of aesthetic judgments do yet not directly
support the conservation of ecosystem services. Indeed, our study is part of a broader
framework that explores new uses for virtual reality for conservation, in this case, to assess reef
aesthetics. Instead, our work here only demonstrates the potential, but not yet its application to
the realization of better conservation outcomes. To accommodate this reviewer’s concerns
about where we have reached in supporting better conservation outcomes, we have edited the
title to read, “Using virtual reality to estimate aesthetic values of coral reefs”.
<U+F0B7> Another example is the claim "The results of this study clearly show the benefits of
using VR to elicit aesthetic information from scientists and the general public." Where
is this shown? The authors used VR in their experiment. But there is no other
comparison point. Is it better than using just images? Is it better than real immersion
in the environment? Without any point of comparison, it is difficult to assess whether
VR is beneficial or not.
A comparison of elicitation methods was performed at the same time as the reef aesthetics
experiment. Results will be published in the coming months. Meanwhile, we agree with the
reviewer and have edited the first and last sentences of this paragraph accordingly.
Lines 301-316:
The combined use of VR and modern statistical modelling can be easily applied to elicit
information in other domains for conservation purposes including social benefits and
educational and environmental outreach opportunities for coral reefs, in addition to other
similar remote ecosystems that are difficult or expensive to physically access. For example, the
ability to immerse citizens into virtual coral reefs is likely to create new insights regarding
coral-reef knowledge compared to 2D images or high-resolution underwater video, which are
typically shown in the media. In addition, the VR experience could be used to increase the
public’s understanding of environmental pressures on coral reefs (37) and their willingness to
pay for the ecosystem services that reefs provide. Conservation strategies that include peoples’
willingness to pay for environmental services have been implemented to encourage
reforestation in Europe and South-America (38). Our findings also illustrate different uses of
uncertainty levels among observer groups. Further investigations into the sources of these
uncertainty levels and their impacts on cognitive systems will be useful for understanding the
sense of beauty perceived by human observers. It will also show the benefits of using the VR
experience compared to other more traditional elicitation methods such as online surveys and
interviews on paper.
Reviewer 2
Comments to the Author(s)
<U+F0B7> Abstract – it would be useful to include a note that there were not group level
differences as expected, as this is something readers would be curious about when
reading this paper.
We agree and the following sentence has been added to the abstract.
Lines 60-62:
There were no group level differences in the way the observer groups perceived reef aesthetics
suggesting that past experiences with coral reefs do not necessarily influence the perception of
beauty by the observer.
<U+F0B7> Pg. 6 – Can the authors provide details on the linkage method used and any
justification if possible?
The method used is a logistic regression computed using the Bayesian framework. The
sentence has been modified and a foundational reference to Generalized Linear Models added
to help the reader to better understand the methodology. The justification of the statistical
modelling approach is given in the Supplementary Information, the section entitled “2.Reef
aesthetic model and results”.
Lines 119-122:
A Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression model (20) was developed to quantify the
relationship between aesthetic attributes and the overall perception of an aesthetically pleasing
reef, which also provided insights about the relationship between past experiences and an
observers’ sense of beauty.
Supplementary Information:
A hierarchical logistic regression approach was used because of the nature of the response
variable (i.e. binary data) and the complexity of the experiment (i.e multiple images and several
reef clusters and groups of observers).
<U+F0B7> Pg. 6 – Can the authors provide just a sentence or two summarizing how Ref. 13
hypothesized these key attributes?
These key attributes were defined as part of the most recent assessment of the state of
conservation of the Great Barrier Reef Heritage sites. In relation to the World Heritage
Convention, the aesthetic component of the GBR has to be assessed along with the suite of
more commonly assessed and understood health and biodiversity metrics. An additional
sentence has been added to reflect this.
Lines 126-128:
The images represented a range of attributes that are believed to describe the aesthetic value of
the Great Barrier Reef (13) and defined as part of a previous assessment of the Great Barrier
Reef World Heritage Area in 2013.
<U+F0B7> Pg. 6 – Please provide details in the methods how exactly experimental design (a)
viewed at least one image from the 3 clusters (pristine, damaged, degraded); (b) order
of images was varied across participants; and (c) each image was used for elicitation
approximately the same # of times.
Information about the experimental design and a reference showing its application for
ecological conservation have been added to the manuscript. Also, additional details about the
stratified random sampling design appear in section 1.3 of the Supplementary Information file
and reported below.
Lines 139-145:
We then developed a random sampling design, stratified across each of the reef clusters, (22)
that ensured that 1) each observer’s perceptions and observations were elicited during viewing
of at least one image from each of the three clusters, 2) the order of the images presented to an
observer were varied among the participants, and 3) each image was used for elicitation
approximately the same number of times (see Supplementary Information). The package
cluster (23) was used for hierarchical clustering and all analyses were undertaken in the R
statistical software (24).
Supplementary Information:
1.3 Other images
After viewing the training image, the participants were shown four images from a pool of 38
images. The images were selected using a stratified random sampling design (2) in order to
show observers reefs from each reef cluster. The sampling design was developed for up to 150
participants, <U+0001D45A>, 4 sample times, <U+0001D458><U+0001D457> , corresponding to the number of images shown during the
interview (in addition to the training image) and 3 reef clusters, <U+0001D457>.
To sample <U+0001D458><U+0001D457> times within cluster <U+0001D457> for each of the <U+0001D45A> participants, a vector of the <U+0001D45B><U+0001D457> image
labels was permuted randomly, replicated <U+2308><U+0001D45A><U+0001D458><U+0001D457> /<U+0001D45B><U+0001D457> <U+2309> times and truncated to length <U+0001D45A><U+0001D458><U+0001D457> . In this
way, the maximum discrepancy between the numbers of times any pair of images would be
allocated to the participants was 1. This vector was again permuted randomly and coerced to a
matrix of dimension <U+0001D45A> × <U+0001D458><U+0001D457> and only kept as a valid design if no image was assigned to the
same participant twice. This method was used to assign each participant one image from each
of the degraded and damaged reef clusters, and two from the pristine reef cluster. The order of
viewing these four images was randomly permuted for each user and all four were elicited after
completing the elicitation of the training image. In this way, each image was viewed
approximately the same number of times across the study design, with sequence effects
removed via the permutation after ensuring every participant viewed the training image first.
<U+F0B7> Pg. 7 – It is important to report details about the training image used across
participants because it likely created an anchor on which subsequent judgments during
the aesthetics interview were based.
We agree that this is an important point and we thought carefully about this when we selected
it. We have therefore added a description of reef attributes to the revised version of the
manuscript.
Lines 164-167:
The reef habitat presented in the training image was characterized by high visibility, structural
complexity, and colourfulness. Its coral cover and health were low to medium, [0-20% coral
cover] (26), with no visible coral damage, schools of fish, or a variety of fish species, but soft
corals were present.
<U+F0B7> Pg. 9 – The certain Yes/No responses made up an overall 76% of responses, but were
the %s high for each group? The subsequent analysis rests on these certain responses,
so knowing each group’s agreement level would be useful.
We agree that it is important to understand the relationship between the yes/no responses and
the %s. across observer groups. We present this information in Table 2. In this table, we show
that the Marine Scientists answered with certainty 73.2% of time, Experienced Divers with
76.9% and Citizens 65.6%.
<U+F0B7> Related to the point above, it would be useful to discuss a bit more about the group-
level differences in certainty Yes/No aesthetic judgments. Although there is similarity
in the results in what predicts aesthetic judgment across groups, this is for images
agreed upon with certainty in terms of their aesthetic value. Why is there less
agreement in the citizen group and marine scientist group compared to the
experienced diver group? What implications do these group-level agreement
differences have for ecological conservation?
Discussion on the agreement at the group-level is complicated because we did not ask the
participants why they were sure (or not sure) of their answers. However, some thoughts related
to these findings are presented in the Discussion (Lines 276-300). We postulate that the group-
level agreement differences are linked to a mix of societal beliefs for the Citizen and ecological
and knowledge for the Marine Scientists. The Marine Scientists uncertainty likely reflected
differences in scientific opinions about the state of reefs stemming mostly from disagreement
about the extent of coral damage, which is often difficult to define precisely. In contrast, the
citizens appeared to use their uncertainty when they did not know an answer because of a lack
of knowledge or difficulties seeing features within the 360-degree images. We agree with the
reviewer that these points are very interesting but without proper information about the sources
of these uncertainty levels among observer groups, we believe a more in-depth discussion
would be beyond reasonable limits given the information currently available. Nevertheless, we
also agree that this is an important issue, and so we nominate this as a topic for future research
that should be afforded top priority.
Lines 301-316:
The combined use of VR and modern statistical modelling can be easily applied to elicit
information in other domains for conservation purposes including social benefits and
educational and environmental outreach opportunities for coral reefs, in addition to other
similar remote ecosystems that are difficult or expensive to physically access. For example, the
ability to immerse citizens into virtual coral reefs is likely to create new insights regarding
coral-reef knowledge compared to 2D images or high-resolution underwater video, which are
typically shown in the media. In addition, the VR experience could be used to increase the
public’s understanding of environmental pressures on coral reefs (37) and their willingness to
pay for the ecosystem services that reefs provide. Conservation strategies that include peoples’
willingness to pay for environmental services have been implemented to encourage
reforestation in Europe and South-America (38). Our findings also illustrate different uses of
uncertainty levels among observer groups. Further investigations into the sources of these
uncertainty levels and their impacts on cognitive systems will be useful for understanding the
sense of beauty perceived by human observers. It will also show the benefits of using the VR
experience compared to other more traditional elicitation methods such as online surveys and
interviews on paper.
