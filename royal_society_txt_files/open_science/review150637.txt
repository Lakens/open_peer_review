The article "The roles of contact conformity, temperature and displacement amplitude on the
lubricated fretting wear of a steel-on-steel contact" deals with the effectiveness of lubrication in
steel contacts under fretting. The manuscript is well written and be of interest for the research
community. However, the manuscript has some points requiring a deeper insight.
Mandatory corrections:
1- Experimental procedure:
The wave displacement type must be identified in order to know the variation of the speed
throughout the cycle.
2- The definition of the covered semi-width should be better supported and the limits of the
fretting must be better discussed. Several authors limit the fretting to the cases were b is higher
than the real displacement amplitude. In fact this establish a difference between two cases:
- A portion of the contact remain covered always along an entire cycle: the density of
energy is similar in both side of the contact, the hydrodynamic lubrication models can’t be
applied, the ejection of the debris is difficult, …
- All the contact area in the quasi-static specimen is exposed to the surroundings: the
density of energy is significantly different in both contact sides, the hydrodynamic lubrication
models can be applied, the ejection of the debris is more easy, the access of the air is easy, …
The results of the present paper enhance this difference, different lubrication effects were
identified for both cases. Applying the above classification, the lubricant protect much better the
surfaces under reciprocating contact than under fretting contact conditions.
3 – Experimental results: effect of contact conformity:
The results on the graphic of the figure 7 a) display a significant increase of the wear rate with the
conformity of the contact. As the wear rate depends on the wear volume and on the real
amplitude displacement, these two effects should be discussed. If it was possible, the inclusion of
some real loops along the test for the different radius will allow to could better identify what
effect is really more determinant for the increase of the wear rate and will allow additionally to
appraise the variation of the energy along the test.

label_comment_2
This paper largely reports experimental results. It is useful as it stands, although the
explanations for the observed results are largely qualitative. I recommend publication subject to
minor modifications:
1. I am not completely clear about the heating system and the temperatures achieved. In
the text it says that the USMB and LSMB have heaters. Are these the only heat sources, or is the
oil heated externally? If so, why are the other two heaters needed? Could the authors clarify this
point and also give an estimate of the temperature at the contact itself?
2. Why do the authors choose to normalise the wear volume in the way that they do (eq 2)?
In particular, the normalisation with load seems to pre-suppose an Archard-type law. Why not,
for example, normalise with respect to the area of the contact times the slip displacement? This,
then, would at least be dimensionless.
3. The diagrams in fig 6 and eq 3 use upper case delta*, when lower case is correct. The
authors imply in the text that this is a reasonable simplification, but they give no justification for
this. Could they please give typical values of the two parameters? I take the point that b may
change, but I am not sure that this justifies an additional approximation.
4. Table 2 gives details of radius and slip, but not temperatures. It would be helpful to
have an expanded table giving all of the experimental conditions. I found it rather easy to get lost
in Section 3.
5. The authors say in the text that the contact pressure decreases as the radius increases.
This is true for smooth contact, of course, but the scars seem to show discontinuous contact in
some cases. How, then, do they know what the real contact pressure is?
6. What steps were taken to ensure flatness of the samples and alignment in the direction
parallel to the axis of the cylindrical pad surface?
7. Figures should use different symbols and/or line fonts to distinguish lines rather than
colours, which will not suffice in the printed version of the journal or in a black and white print of
a .pdf.
8. All photographs of scars (e.g. fig 7) need a scale bar which is readable at the scale of the
reproduction.
4
9. Why do the scans of the surface (e.g. fig 9) show 5mm of width, when the wear is within
1.5mm, it would be better to reduce the width of the plots and change their orientation to
horizontal so as to show more detail in the same space.
10. I realise that the authors are trying to use the same colour bar scale on all of the scans,
but I really think that the advantages of this are outweighed by the lack of detail in some of the
plots. For instance, fig 12 has a contour range of 200 microns, yet is trying to show data with a
range of 7 microns. Please use contour ranges appropriate to the data.
11. Why (at the bottom of p19) is the decreased wear rate difficult to attribute to decreased
viscosity? Is it that the viscosity change is not that significant?
12. Could we be explicitly told the frequency and the corresponding range of velocities
(discussion at bottom of p20).
13. Is the vertical axis of the IRG diagram better expressed as pressure rather than load?
14. Could fig 25 please be shown the same size as those we are meant to be comparing it
with?
15. The conclusions read as more of a summary of results. This is not really necessary –
what one really wants is ‘What do we conclude?’ (other than that this is all very complex). Please
re-write the conclusion section to make it more focussed.

Comments to the Author(s) and Author Responses
The article "The roles of contact conformity, temperature and displacement amplitude on the
lubricated fretting wear of a steel-on-steel contact" deals with the effectiveness of lubrication in
steel contacts under fretting. The manuscript is well written and be of interest for the research
community.
We are pleased by this overall support for the manuscript.
However, the manuscript has some points requiring a deeper insight.
Mandatory corrections:
1- Experimental procedure:
The wave displacement type must be identified in order to know the variation of the speed
throughout the cycle.
We have added an entirely new section at the beginning of the results (Section 3.1) which describes
the fretting motion in detail. This includes the addition of a new figure (Figure 7) which provides data
in the form of displacement-time histories for the fretting motion for four examples, namely with
cylinder radii of 6 mm and 160 mm and with applied displacements of both 25 and 100 µm in each
case. The text in the new section 3.1 describes the sliding velocities observed in the four cases
presented.
This new figure and the sliding velocities derived from them have been employed throughout the
discussion in section 4.3 (page 29).
2- The definition of the covered semi-width should be better supported and the limits of the fretting
must be better discussed. Several authors limit the fretting to the cases were b is higher than the
real displacement amplitude. In fact this establish a difference between two cases:
- A portion of the contact remain covered always along an entire cycle: the density of energy
is similar in both side of the contact, the hydrodynamic lubrication models can’t be applied, the
ejection of the debris is difficult, …
- All the contact area in the quasi-static specimen is exposed to the surroundings: the density
of energy is significantly different in both contact sides, the hydrodynamic lubrication models can be
applied, the ejection of the debris is more easy, the access of the air is easy, …
The results of the present paper enhance this difference, different lubrication effects were identified
for both cases. Applying the above classification, the lubricant protect much better the surfaces
under reciprocating contact than under fretting contact conditions.
The reviewer here is right to question the definition of the limits to fretting; indeed, this has been
widely debated, with the key area of uncertainty being the transition between fretting and
reciprocating sliding. However, the terminology “fretting” is commonly used in the literature for a
wide variety of contacts with small amplitude reciprocating motion.
We are in full agreement with the reviewer; as the reviewer has identified, we have identified the
“covered area” as critical, and this forms a central feature of our paper. Rather than continue with
the debate about what should be defined as “fretting” and what should be defined as “reciprocating
sliding”, we have simply identified the critical role of the covered area. The importance of this is
indicated that it is a key part of the abstract.
We do not, however, fully concur with all of the reviewers comment; we suggest that the summary
provided by the reviewer is not in accord with some of the evidence that we have provided (e.g. we
do not believe that, even when there is no covered area, “access of the air is easy”).
We feel that the brief summary provided by the reviewer captures very well the essence of the
content of the paper, but that in the presentation of our work, we need to avoid any potential for
misunderstandings about what is fretting and what is reciprocating sliding. As such, we have added
some text to the very first paragraph of the introduction to address this.
3 – Experimental results: effect of contact conformity:
The results on the graphic of the figure 7 a) [now Figure 10] display a significant increase of the wear
rate with the conformity of the contact. As the wear rate depends on the wear volume and on the
real amplitude displacement, these two effects should be discussed. If it was possible, the inclusion
of some real loops along the test for the different radius will allow to could better identify what
effect is really more determinant for the increase of the wear rate and will allow additionally to
appraise the variation of the energy along the test.
When the reviewer says :” As the wear rate depends on the wear volume and on the real amplitude
displacement,….”, it is perhaps not clear exactly what the concern is. The volume is directly
measured; additionally, we use the slip amplitude (rather than the displacement amplitude) so that
the actual total slip distance can be evaluated.; In this regard we already say in the text (section 2.2,
page 6) “Wear and transfer rates for the contact pair were calculated based on the average test slip
amplitude (d*) and the number of cycles per test (C), as defined in Equation 2.”
In addition, the reviewer has prompted us to add another figure to show “some real loops along the
test”. Such a figure has now been added (new Figure 9), which gives clear insight in the way that the
reviewer has indicated. Additional text to describe the figure has been added to the first paragraph
of Section 3.2 (page 10).
4- SEM pictures figures 8, 11, 14 …
The dimension of the pictures is very small and don’t allows to understand the scales. In any case the
inclusion of even higher magnification observations will allow a better understanding of the damage
mechanisms.
our inappropriate sizing of them. We have now re-sized them so that both the low magnification
image and the high magnification image in each pair (covering Figures 11, 14, 17, 20 and 23) are of a
size where the reader should be able to appraise the evidence which they should afford.We are very
grateful for the highlighting of this by the reviewer.
5- Topography patterns of the wear surfaces figures 9, 12… The scale in both the axis of the scanned
area and on the wear depth must be indicated.
We apologise for this omission. We have now included information regarding the x and y scales for
these images in the figure caption in each case, along with information regarding the height scale.
This has been completed for all images of this type (Figures 12, 15, 18, 21, 24).
6- Reliability of the results

A statement regarding repeatability of data is now included in Section 2.1 (just before Table 1 on
page 5).
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s) and Author Responses
This paper largely reports experimental results. It is useful as it stands, although the explanations for
the observed results are largely qualitative. I recommend publication subject to minor
modifications:
Again, we are very pleased by this supportive overview, with the indication that only minor
modifications are required.
1. I am not completely clear about the heating system and the temperatures achieved. In
the text it says that the USMB and LSMB have heaters. Are these the only heat sources,
or is the oil heated externally? If so, why are the other two heaters needed? Could the
authors clarify this point and also give an estimate of the temperature at the contact
itself?
New text has been added towards the end of Section 2.1, (on page 5- from about nine lines before
Table 1) to clarify the situation as follows:
“(in all tests, the upper and lower specimens were set to the same temperature); the lubricant
itself was not directly heated. Insulation of the whole working area during testing results in all of
the main components being at the same temperature, including the bulk of the lubricant bath; it
is, however, recognized that flash temperatures in the contact will result in thermal excursions in
the area of the contact.”
2. Why do the authors choose to normalise the wear volume in the way that they do (eq
2)? In particular, the normalisation with load seems to pre-suppose an Archard-type
law. Why not, for example, normalise with respect to the area of the contact times the
slip displacement? This, then, would at least be dimensionless.
The normalisation that we have employed is common in work on fretting wear. As the reviewer
suggests, this does pre-suppose Archard-type behaviour, but this is because this has generally been
results to be compared with those of others reported in the literature presented in the same way.
One further comment regards the suggestion of the reviewer to normalise with regard to the area of
the contact. It is generally understood that wear rate of metals normally depends upon applied force
rather than upon the nominal contact pressure because the contact only occurs at asperities which
generally plastically deform (depending upon the plasticity index); as such, it is thus the applied load
(rather than applied pressure) that has validity in normalisation. As such, we would suggest that
whilst the suggestion of the reviewer has merit in terms of producing a dimensionless number, it
does not have a strong physical basis. The standard normalisation used in the community (and,
indeed, suggested by Archard himself) to produce a dimensionless number employs the hardness of
the softer body; however, over the years, this has been shown to have limited validity, and given
that we do not vary our materials, this is not required in this work.
One final comment is that whilst the contact load remains constant, the contact pressure varies as
wear progresses, and thus cannot be readily determined at all points in the test.
We hope that the editor will allow us to retain the normalisation as suggested in Equation 2.
3. The diagrams in fig 6 and eq 3 use upper case delta*, when lower case is correct. The
authors imply in the text that this is a reasonable simplification, but they give no
justification for this. Could they please give typical values of the two parameters? I take
the point that b may change, but I am not sure that this justifies an additional
approximation.
The reviewer is right to point out that we had made a simplification, and had then gone on to
include it, both in the equation (Equation 3) and in the diagram which illustrated this (Figure 6). In
the original text, we had described and justified the simplification as follows:
“(due to their similarity, it is judged to be adequate to utilise <U+0394>* instead of d* since this is only a
conservative estimate, appropriate for the initial Hertzian contact conditions, with the covered width
rapidly increasing as wear occurs).”
However, whilst we believe that the assumption is essential, we recognise that codifying the
assumption into the equation and diagram was incorrect and unhelpful, and accordingly, we have
reformulated the equation and diagram as suggested by the reviewer.
However, the assumption that we can replace d* with <U+0394>* is both necessary and justified. We have
significantly strengthened the argument for this in the 16 new lines of text which come directly after
Equation 3 (which includes a new equation, Equation 4). We have argued that due to changes
throughout the test, both the actual contact width and d* vary, but <U+0394>* and b (the initial contact
width) do not, which makes the use of these latter terms essential; moreover, via newly added
analysis (backed up by the addition of a new figure (Figure 8) illustrating fretting loops), we have
shown that the difference between d* with <U+0394>* is not more than 20% in the very worst cases for this
work. Moreover, we have explained that both of the assumptions made result in our estimate for
the covered area being a lower-bound, which is helpful in the later analysis (we have changed the
caption for Table 2 to make it clear that the estimates of bc are lower bounds).
We hope that this strengthened presentation of the assumption here will satisfy the concern rightly
raised by the reviewer.
have an expanded table giving all of the experimental conditions. I found it rather easy
to get lost in Section 3.
The function of Table 2 is not to present the matrix of test conditions (the main experimental
parameters are already presented in Table 1). Instead, its function is to present (for each set of
experimental parameters) the Hertzian contact pressure and contact width, along with the covered
width. None of these parameters change with temperature, and we would therefore argue that it is
appropriate to retain this table as it is; we hope that the editor will consent to allow this.
5. The authors say in the text that the contact pressure decreases as the radius increases.
This is true for smooth contact, of course, but the scars seem to show discontinuous
contact in some cases. How, then, do they know what the real contact pressure is?
All mechanical contacts consist of asperity contacts where the pressure is typically higher than the
yield stresses of the materials (see our response to Comment #2 of Reviewer #2). However, if a fluid
film separates the surfaces, then this ceases to be the case. In this work, when we refer to the
contact pressures, we are referring to the nominal pressures which will influence whether there is
breakdown of the fluid film. Accordingly, in the abstract, in the conclusions and in sections 3.2 and
4.4, we have made it clear that we are referring to the nominal contact pressure.
6. What steps were taken to ensure flatness of the samples and alignment in the direction
parallel to the axis of the cylindrical pad surface?
We take great care in sample alignment. Three lines of new text have been added to describe this in
section 2.1 (soon after Figure 1) as follows:
“During assembly of the fretting pair, the USMB is able to rotate around the axis of fretting;
application of a small load to the pair at this stage ensures that the axis of the cylindrical
specimen lies in the plane of the flat specimen, whereupon the rotation of the USMB is fixed.”
7. Figures should use different symbols and/or line fonts to distinguish lines rather than
colours, which will not suffice in the printed version of the journal or in a black and
white print of a .pdf.
We appreciate the concern raised by the reviewer here (namely the need “to distinguish lines” in
graphs). We have ensured that any graphs do not have colour identification system, and have
removed this from any existing graphs. This now relates to Figures 8, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 26.
8. All photographs of scars (e.g. fig 7) need a scale bar which is readable at the scale of the
reproduction.
We fully understand the concerns of the reviewer here, and have changed the format of the figures
of concern (now numbered Figs 11, 14, 17, 20 and 23).
9. Why do the scans of the surface (e.g. fig 9) show 5mm of width, when the wear is within
1.5mm, it would be better to reduce the width of the plots and change their orientation
to horizontal so as to show more detail in the same space.
We would very much like to retain these images as they are (please see our response to point 10
below). We hope that the editor will consent to this.
10. I realise that the authors are trying to use the same colour bar scale on all of the scans,
but I really think that the advantages of this are outweighed by the lack of detail in some
of the plots. For instance, fig 12 has a contour range of 200 microns, yet is trying to
show data with a range of 7 microns. Please use contour ranges appropriate to the data.
In this work, the main damage mechanisms are characterized by scanning electron microscopy
(Figures 11, 14, 17, 20, 23 and 28). These high magnification images are necessarily local (and do not
always give a good impression of the height / depth of damage). As such, we view the profilometry
as being entirely supplementary to these, and their purpose is complimentary. We do not need the
profile to provide detail of the damage mechanisms (since this is provided by the SEM images), but
instead, we utilise the profiles to show that in some cases, the damage is very slight across the
whole scar, or that in other cases, there are significant but localised patches of damage across the
scar. We would argue that it is essential for all of the profiles throughout the paper to be presented
with the same vertical scale, even if this does mean that in some cases, the scale of the damage is
very slight compared to other cases. The quantification of that damage is presented in the plots of
wear rate, and the detailed imaging of that damage is presented in the scanning electron
micrographs. We believe that the way that we have presented the profilometry will serve the reader
well in their understanding of the comparative scales of damage, and with regard to the localisation
(or otherwise) of damage, and we would hope that the editor would consider our request to retain
these profiles in the way that they have been presented.
11. Why (at the bottom of p19) is the decreased wear rate difficult to attribute to decreased
viscosity? Is it that the viscosity change is not that significant?
The text previously read:
“however, as with the experiments with the 300 µm displacement amplitude with
the higher contact conformity (160 mm radius cylinders) (where again the
covered width is zero), a decrease in wear rate with increasing temperature is
observed at the highest temperatures (Figure 23 (b)) which is difficult to attribute
to the enhanced penetration afforded by the decreasing lubricant viscosity with
this increasing temperature.”
We recognise that this lacked perspicuity, and accordingly we have rephrased the text in the
paragraph soon after Figure 26 as follows (now on page 28):
“A similar decrease in wear rate with increasing temperature is observed at the highest
temperature is observed with the more conforming contact (160 mm radius cylinder) with
the 300 <U+F06D>m displacement amplitude where, again, the covered width is zero (Figure 26 (b)).
In all these cases, since the covered area is either very small or zero, lubricant readily
accesses all areas of the contact, and thus the decrease in wear rate as the temperature is
increased from 150oC to 230oC cannot be attributed to any enhancement in lubricant
penetration which might be afforded by the commensurate reduction in lubricant viscosity.”
We hope that this rephrasing of the argument is now clear.
12. Could we be explicitly told the frequency and the corresponding range of velocities
(discussion at bottom of p20).
In section 2.1, we already stated the fretting frequency as follows:
85, 150 and 230oC and run at a frequency of 20 Hz for a duration of 100 000 cycles; test
information is summarized in Table 1.”
A similar request regarding velocities was made by Referee 1, Comment #1. To reiterate the
response made to that comment, we have added a new section (Section 3.1) which describes the
fretting motion in detail. This includes the addition of a new figure (Figure 7) which provides data in
the form of displacement-time histories for cylinder radii of 6 mm and 160 mm for applied
displacements of both 25 and 100 µm. The text in the section describes the sliding velocities
observed in the four cases presented. We trust that this will address the concerns expressed by the
reviewer.
13. Is the vertical axis of the IRG diagram better expressed as pressure rather than load?
The IRG diagram is taken from the literature, and is always presented as a load. We do not consider
that we can alter this figure. (Note to the editor – since the first submission and this resubmission
we have changed the actual figure used, since we were finding it difficult to get permission to
reproduce it from the original publisher. We are now using a version from a conference where it
indicates that papers may be reproduced freely as long as the authors and publishers are
acknowledged. The basic form of the figure has not changed).
14. Could fig 25 please be shown the same size as those we are meant to be comparing it
with?
We have increased the physical size of the other SEM micrographs so that they are the same as the
micrograph in the figure as indicated (now Figure 28).
15. The conclusions read as more of a summary of results. This is not really necessary –
what one really wants is ‘What do we conclude?’ (other than that this is all very
complex). Please re-write the conclusion section to make it more focussed.
The conclusions have been largely retained, but with a significant reduction in details to ensure that
this is not just a summary of results. The authors thank the reviewer for this comment.
