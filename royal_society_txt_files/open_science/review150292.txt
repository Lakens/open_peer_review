The paper presents the results of 2 surveys of friends on social media which are interpreted in
light of Dunbar’s SBH theory of social relationships at different levels of intimacy. The results
indicate that social relationships maintained on line are similar to those in the face-to-face world.
The paper reports an on line survey which has been analysed competently. The contribution of
the paper is limited since the survey collected only sparse data on estimates of friends on line
social media. There are several areas where the description of the analysis and the clarity of the
discussion cold be improved.
P5. What was the criterion used by the sampling agency for ‘regular use of social media’ ? Every
day ??
P6. Similar question- ‘attended business meetings’ ? I assume this means professional
respondents. The sampling criteria are vague. More interesting results could have been obtained
with a more systematic sampling strategy, e.g. socio economic division, age, gender. It is also a
pity that a categorical scale was used e.g. estimate friends in the range 100-200, 200-300 rather
than giving the actual number. People tend to give vague estimates to range category questions.
Fig 2. Why were the category ranges different in the two samples (25, then 100 (A) or 50 (B)
intervals). This could introduce a bias when comparing means between the populations.
P6, Results. The mean of sample 2 (182.8) is much higher than sample 1, not surprising since the
business oriented respondents probably included many acquaintances and business contacts as
well as social friends. A t test should be carried out to compare the 2 samples which look sig diff
on the means. The inter sample variation need to be addressed more thoroughly in the
discussion.
P8, para 2. This paragraph appears to argue that people will include additional on line friends
(acquaintances) which may well have biased the results, especially in sample 2- see above. The
conclusions need to be more tentative given the limitations of the study.
Pp7-10. The discussion is on the long side for the quantity and quality of the results presented.
Since Dunbar’s theory predicts the average number of social relationships which are actively
maintained, we do not know whether the friends reported in the survey were actually proximal
to the egos and therefore were maintained by both physical and virtual (Internet) contact.
Omission of a question estimating the number of remote (distant) versus proximal friends is a
weakness in the survey.

Review for ‘ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS ARE NOT LARGER THAN THOSE IN THE
OFFLINE WORLD,’ submitted to Royal Society Open Science.
This work is certainly timely, and likely of interest to those following this topic of research. There
is a growing body of literature around the comparison of offline social networks and online social
networks, both in terms of size and other theoretical areas such as social capital. What follows is a
review of the manuscript. I hope it helps the authors with their work.
The abstract needs a little edit, it is hard for the reader to parse out what is being researched in
the current research vs. larger claims.
The authors do a good job reporting their study as well as framing it in other literature. The main
issue that I can find is that the data is a fairly simple dataset compared to the questions stated in
the intro/lit and the conclusions that are drawn out of the findings. Some of the questions posed
in the buildup are some of the largest and most challenging questions facing information and
communication technology (ICT) researchers, and certainly surpass the generalizability of the
data collected. Further, there have been a number of scholars that have already published
research comparing online and offline network size as well as the number of people in online
networks that the subjects would consider “string ties” (e.g. Michael Stefanone at SUNY Buffalo
has published on both of these areas), yet those studies are not cited here. I would encourage the
authors to do a somewhat more extensive literature review, specifically including works in the
Journal of Computer Mediated Communication, New Media and Society, and The Information
Society. Suffice it to say, the literature reviewed is more geared towards the Social Brain
Hypothesis, whereas the data seems to be more geared towards communication technology
research. Some scholars like Wellman and such are included, but peripherally.
When situated in the SBH literature, there is likely more of a contribution, and I would encourage
the author(s) to consider pulling back a little on the depth of the questions posed in regards to
online and offline social network comparisons, since the contributions here seem to be secondary.
Perhaps I should reframe it this way, if the anticipated contribution of this research is for the
computer-mediated communication / ICT field, then there needs to be some additional literature
and reworking of claims; if primarily for the SBH area, then likely more appropriate, but that is
outside of my area of expertise so I can not asses with confidence.
Outside of the above issues, the manuscript seems well prepared, clearly written, and well
structured.

Keywords: network size, social brain hypothesis, social networking sites, egocentric networks
Abstract: The claim that online social networking has changed our capacity for sociality by
enabling us to maintain much larger social networks is tested using two separate stratified
random surveys. The data show that the size of online egocentric social networks, indexed as the
number of Facebook friends, is the same as those obtained from studies of the offline world.
Moreover, they are structured in much the same way with a similar layered organisation. This
suggests that as originally proposed by the Social Brain Hypothesis, there is a significant
cognitive constraint on the size of social networks that online social networks seem unable to
overcome.

The paper has been improved with inclusion of additional data in the SI.
There appear to be some lessons in problems encountered when out sourcing surveys to
professional agencies.
The response to my last point assumes that ALL members of the Support and Sympathy group
are by definition geographically proximal. I doubt this is true especially for the Sympathy group.
People keep in contact with good friends abroad via social media.

Research evidences are pointing to some humans constraints that limit the size of people's social
networks offline. This article is asking whether or not social media are helping people to go
beyond these networking constraints.
This is a very interesting and important question. Social media are giving humans extensive tools
and functionality that are likely in supporting people to increase both their connections and
sociability. We also know from the more early research that the prime motivations for using
social media among youngsters was not to have social contacts with close ties, but rather to
extend and develop new relationships, besides to keep in touch with existing peers or
friends(Brandtzaeg, Heim, & Kaare, 2010). The rich get richer hypothesis (sometimes referred to
as “The Matthew Effect,” (Merton, 1968)) that claims that people who are socially competent in
real life will also become competent in social interaction social media and, as a result, expand and
consolidate their networks of friends, and their social capital (Freberg, Adams, McGaughey, &
Freberg, 2010; Valkenburg, Schouten, & Peter, 2005; Wang & Wellman, 2010; Quane-Haase &
Wellman, 2004).
10
Yet, more fresh research have seen evidence that the motivations related to social media use has
been changing with a more focus on family driven communication and a more focus on close ties
over the years (Brandtzaeg, 2012). One reason might be the cognitive limits within humans that
hinder people to increase their social networks by social media, another reason might be privacy
issues. However, an important finding by in a longitudinal study by Brandtzaeg (2012) is that
different types of SNS-usage, might imply different levels of social networking. "People may be
stressed by too many connections, and thus not willing to increase their weaker ties over time. An
exception is Debaters and Advanced Users, who showed a significant increase in their number of
acquaintances from 2008 to 2010" . A key finding from this latter study is also that the majority of
social networking sites users not are using SNSs for socializing. The majority of the SNS-users are
passive in their daily use, dealing with lurking activities looking into others posts and comments.
As this submitted manuscript also partly suggests is that females seems to cope with social
networking online better than males.
The submitted article is really well written and a pleasure to read. I also think there is a lot of
good reasoning along the manuscript. The methodology and analysis seems to me for being valid
and sound. However, the discussion could add more issues. A longer discussion of mechanisms
would be very welcome, if not needed. What mechanisms lead to the humans' constraints that
limit the size of people's social networks online we are observing? Is merely the brain function?
Or is it different uses? Privacy issues? How do we explain the patterns in other ways? Are there
some new explanations or theories that help make sense of the constraints? Are these the same
that apply for differences in networking offline?
Teens have started to use Facebook to a lesser degree in favor for more discrete services, such as
Vine, Snapchat and Instagram, where they can find exclusively peer group communication and
escape from their family and general adult surveillance. As Global Web index are finding: "There
is a clear trend to single purpose social apps along private and closed messaging services."
http://www.globalwebindex.net/blog/facebook-teens
The membership of these services is smaller and the age composition is a lot younger compared
to the big crowd on Facebook, and as such a youth hub where different social ties across
generations, as in Facebook, is more or less absent.
A reason for this changing social interaction pattern among youth is that many users of Facebook
are simply looking for a more private alternative. Similarly, a recent Pew Research study
(Madden, 2013) suggested that teens’ relationship with Facebook is complicated due to too many
adults and too much drama. Youth experience their Facebook usage to be less open and private
because of social pressure towards conformity, as well as adult surveillance, and context collapse
which already where something that where suggested in 2010, by a study called "Too Many
Facebook Friends" (Brandtzaeg et al., 2010).

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper presents the results of 2 surveys of friends on social media which are interpreted
in light of Dunbar’s SBH theory of social relationships at different levels of intimacy. The
results indicate that social relationships maintained on line are similar to those in the face-to-
face world.
The paper reports an on line survey which has been analysed competently. The contribution
of the paper is limited since the survey collected only sparse data on estimates of friends on
line social media. There are several areas where the description of the analysis and the clarity
of the discussion cold be improved.
P5. What was the criterion used by the sampling agency for ‘regular use of social media’ ?
Every day ??
The criterion was simply “made regular use of social media”; additional details are now
given that reflect the sample population. The aim was not to be too restrictive but to sample
as widely as possible in order to have a representative sample (see also below). The format
of the questions was decided by the polling agency, who are a national professional
company, with their own in-house statisticians.
P6. Similar question- ‘attended business meetings’ ? I assume this means professional
respondents.
Yes. This is now stated.
The sampling criteria are vague. More interesting results could have been obtained with a
more systematic sampling strategy, e.g. socio economic division, age, gender.
Both samples are random stratified samples: that means they are representative across the
whole UK population and balanced for geographical region, age and gender. This has now
been stated.
It is also a pity that a categorical scale was used e.g. estimate friends in the range 100-200,
200-300 rather than giving the actual number. People tend to give vague estimates to range
category questions.
All survey sampling is a compromise between competing costs. Since both surveys
examined many aspects of people’s behavior and were already more than 30 questions long,
there were inevitable limits on how much time cost could be imposed on respondents. The
survey design was undertaken with the advice of the statisticians from the polling agency.
The fact that the two samples yield similar results provides some justification for being
confident in the results, despite these shortcomings.
Fig 2. Why were the category ranges different in the two samples (25, then 100 (A) or 50 (B)
intervals). This could introduce a bias when comparing means between the populations.
The surveys had different purposes and the details were beyond my control. While it is
conceivable that different question structures might have introduced different biases, it is
difficult to see why this particular issue should introduce radical biases in the present case
(other than affect the precision with which, e.g., means are estimated). In any case, any
intrinsic biases introduced by sample questions can be considered to the advantage of the
analysis since the two samples are unlikely to be biased in the same direction, and the biases
will merely increase the error variance and make it less likely to obtain a significant result.
P6, Results. The mean of sample 2 (182.8) is much higher than sample 1, not surprising
since the business oriented respondents probably included many acquaintances and business
contacts as well as social friends. A t test should be carried out to compare the 2 samples
which look sig diff on the means. The inter sample variation need to be addressed more
thoroughly in the discussion.
It is not entirely clear what the point here is. The means do differ significantly, but they also
do not differ from the predicted value, and it is the latter that is of interest, not the former. A
difference of ~30 between the means of the two samples does not really count as especially
large or interesting when set against a natural variance in offline network sizes of roughly
100-200. Indeed, it might be surprising if the two samples did NOT differ, given that they
sample different populations (regular social media users vs business professionals who will
have rather different social media use profiles), but I am not sure why that should be
interesting. A statistical comparison between the two samples has been run, and the results
included, but they really boil down to the fact that the business sample has, not too
surprisingly, many more 0 entries.
P8, para 2. This paragraph appears to argue that people will include additional on line friends
(acquaintances) which may well have biased the results, especially in sample 2- see above.
The conclusions need to be more tentative given the limitations of the study.
The paragraph does not suggest that acquaintances bias the results. It offers an explanation,
based on the structure of offline face-to-face networks, as to why SOME people may have
online networks that are apparently much larger than one might expect given a natural size of
offline networks. The whole point is that online social media do not make a distinction
between different kinds/qualities of friendship, whereas in everyday life we do. This is well
established and is not a speculation. It is important to remember that egocentric networks are
highly structured, both in the online and the offline environments (as has been shown by a
number of studies over the years). Some explanation as to why the right tail in both datasets
is much greater than is the case with offline data is surely desirable?
Pp7-10. The discussion is on the long side for the quantity and quality of the results
presented. Since Dunbar’s theory predicts the average number of social relationships which
are actively maintained, we do not know whether the friends reported in the survey were
actually proximal to the egos and therefore were maintained by both physical and virtual
(Internet) contact. Omission of a question estimating the number of remote (distant) versus
proximal friends is a weakness in the survey.
In fact, we do know how proximal the friends are: this was tested in Fig. 2 by asking
respondents to list the numbers of individuals in the two inner layers of the network. In
addition, another question in the survey asked respondents to state the percentage of all
Facebook friends who were considered real friends: the mean was 28%. These data are now
included in the SI.

Review for ‘ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS ARE NOT LARGER THAN THOSE IN THE
OFFLINE WORLD,’ submitted to Royal Society Open Science.
This work is certainly timely, and likely of interest to those following this topic of research.
There is a growing body of literature around the comparison of offline social networks and
online social networks, both in terms of size and other theoretical areas such as social capital.
What follows is a review of the manuscript. I hope it helps the authors with their work.
The abstract needs a little edit, it is hard for the reader to parse out what is being researched
in the current research vs. larger claims.
The Abstract has been rewritten to provide more detail.
The authors do a good job reporting their study as well as framing it in other literature. The
main issue that I can find is that the data is a fairly simple dataset compared to the questions
stated in the intro/lit and the conclusions that are drawn out of the findings. Some of the
questions posed in the buildup are some of the largest and most challenging questions facing
information and communication technology (ICT) researchers, and certainly surpass the
generalizability of the data collected. Further, there have been a number of scholars that have
already published research comparing online and offline network size as well as the number
of people in online networks that the subjects would consider “string ties” (e.g. Michael
Stefanone at SUNY Buffalo has published on both of these areas), yet those studies are not
cited here. I would encourage the authors to do a somewhat more extensive literature review,
specifically including works in the Journal of Computer Mediated Communication, New
Media and Society, and The Information Society. Suffice it to say, the literature reviewed is
more geared towards the Social Brain Hypothesis, whereas the data seems to be more geared
towards communication technology research. Some scholars like Wellman and such are
included, but peripherally.
Thanks for this suggestion. An extensive search of these journals has been done, and a
number of useful papers turned up by this have now been included. I might comment that
almost all of these comparisons between offline and online networks focus on the innermost
(5) network layer, whereas the concern of this paper is with the full egocentric social
network (the 150 layer).
When situated in the SBH literature, there is likely more of a contribution, and I would
encourage the author(s) to consider pulling back a little on the depth of the questions posed
in regards to online and offline social network comparisons, since the contributions here
seem to be secondary.
Perhaps I should reframe it this way, if the anticipated contribution of this research is for the
computer-mediated communication / ICT field, then there needs to be some additional
literature and reworking of claims; if primarily for the SBH area, then likely more
appropriate, but that is outside of my area of expertise so I can not asses with confidence.
It is probably fair to say that the primary emphasis is in the SBH literature: what the paper is
essentially asking is whether the relaxation of certain key constraints that the online
environment permits has the effect of allowing an increase in social network size.
Outside of the above issues, the manuscript seems well prepared, clearly written, and well
structured.

Comments to the Author(s)
Research evidences are pointing to some humans constraints that limit the size of people's
social networks offline. This article is asking whether or not social media are helping people
to go beyond these networking constraints.
This is a very interesting and important question. Social media are giving humans extensive
tools and functionality that are likely in supporting people to increase both their connections
and sociability. We also know from the more early research that the prime motivations for
using social media among youngsters was not to have social contacts with close ties, but
rather to extend and develop new relationships, besides to keep in touch with existing peers
or friends (Brandtzaeg, Heim, & Kaare, 2010). The rich get richer hypothesis (sometimes
referred to as “The Matthew Effect,” (Merton, 1968)) that claims that people who are
socially competent in real life will also become competent in social interaction social media
and, as a result, expand and consolidate their networks of friends, and their social capital
(Freberg, Adams, McGaughey, & Freberg, 2010; Valkenburg, Schouten, & Peter, 2005;
Wang & Wellman, 2010; Quane-Haase & Wellman, 2004).
These are relevant and important references. Thank you! I have now cited them.
Yet, more fresh research have seen evidence that the motivations related to social media use
has been changing with a more focus on family driven communication and a more focus on
close ties over the years (Brandtzaeg, 2012). One reason might be the cognitive limits within
humans that hinder people to increase their social networks by social media, another reason
might be privacy issues. However, an important finding by in a longitudinal study by
Brandtzaeg (2012) is that different types of SNS-usage, might imply different levels of social
networking. "People may be stressed by too many connections, and thus not willing to
increase their weaker ties over time. An exception is Debaters and Advanced Users, who
showed a significant increase in their number of acquaintances from 2008 to 2010" . A key
finding from this latter study is also that the majority of social networking sites users not are
using SNSs for socializing. The majority of the SNS-users are passive in their daily use,
dealing with lurking activities looking into others posts and comments. As this submitted
manuscript also partly suggests is that females seems to cope with social networking online
better than males.
Yes, I think most of this is widely understood.
The submitted article is really well written and a pleasure to read. I also think there is a lot of
good reasoning along the manuscript. The methodology and analysis seems to me for being
valid and sound. However, the discussion could add more issues. A longer discussion of
mechanisms would be very welcome, if not needed. What mechanisms lead to the humans'
constraints that limit the size of people's social networks online we are observing? Is merely
the brain function? Or is it different uses? Privacy issues? How do we explain the patterns in
other ways? Are there some new explanations or theories that help make sense of the
constraints? Are these the same that apply for differences in networking offline?
This is a good point. I have now added a paragraph to address this issue.
Teens have started to use Facebook to a lesser degree in favor for more discrete services,
such as Vine, Snapchat and Instagram, where they can find exclusively peer group
communication and escape from their family and general adult surveillance. As Global Web
index are finding: "There is a clear trend to single purpose social apps along private and
closed messaging services." http://www.globalwebindex.net/blog/facebook-teens
In this study, I was trying to address the adult cohort, rather than the teens cohort. I am aware
that the teen world has moved on -- although there is an interesting question as to why they
have moved on (one contributing factor has clearly been lack of satisfaction with how SNSs
force the social world into patterns that don’t fit well with how teens like to organize their
social lives, as noted above). Nonetheless, I might observe that the fact that teens are moving
away to more private social media would seem to confirm the central claim of this paper.
The membership of these services is smaller and the age composition is a lot younger
compared to the big crowd on Facebook, and as such a youth hub where different social ties
across generations, as in Facebook, is more or less absent.
A reason for this changing social interaction pattern among youth is that many users of
Facebook are simply looking for a more private alternative. Similarly, a recent Pew
Research study (Madden, 2013) suggested that teens’ relationship with Facebook is
complicated due to too many adults and too much drama. Youth experience their Facebook
usage to be less open and private because of social pressure towards conformity, as well as
adult surveillance, and context collapse which already where something that where
suggested in 2010, by a study called "Too Many Facebook Friends" (Brandtzaeg et al.,
2010).
I am, of course, aware of these pattern changes in recent years. However, this was not really
the central concern of this paper, and hence the issue wasn’t raised. However, it is an
interesting point, and I have now mentioned it in the Introduction, and again in the
Discussion.

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper has been improved with inclusion of additional data in the SI.
There appear to be some lessons in problems encountered when out sourcing surveys to
professional agencies.
Strictly speaking, this is an issue of any large-scale surveys, not one of how agencies handle
these. Agencies will do exactly as you ask them to do.
The response to my last point assumes that ALL members of the Support and Sympathy
group are by definition geographically proximal.
This was certainly not meant to be implied. I had assumed that the term “proximal” was
being used in the standard network sense, meaning “proximal in the network” (i.e. the alters
that are closest to you emotionally or socially), not spatially proximal. The two definitions
might, or might not, coincide, and this likely varies from individual to individual. I have now
noted that we didn’t ask for this information, though, for present purposes, I was not
especially interested in the question (we have several very large samples, including mobile
phone samples, where we have looked at this information).
I doubt this is true especially for the Sympathy group. People keep in contact with good
friends abroad via social media.
I would agree that they do. That said, our evidence suggests that if they don’t, the
relationships will rapidly deteriorate. That is clearly one of the reasons social media have
been so successful.

The author(s) have made efforts to soften the language and include some more literature, as
requested.
One point of clarification, after checking through the list of citation I did find one error, the
Rosen, Stefanone, and Lackaff (2010) citation is incorrect. The correct citation is:
Rosen, D., Stefanone, M. A., & Lackaff, D. (2010). Online and offline social networks:

Thanks! I had trouble tracking it down. Now changed.
