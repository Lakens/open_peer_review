The ms is unexciting and were it not for the fact that information on the diet of these IUCN listed
species is scant, I would recommend publication in a less high profile journal.
I have few comments on what is generally a standard ms, well executed, analysed and
interpreted.

place at the same time of year. Is that appropriate?
line 135/136: What is a small 2.5 ml sample? To my mind, a 2.5 ml sample is already small!
lines 173-175: please indicate, in text not by citation alone, the geographic location of the other
zooplankton samples.

equivalents (1.144) is based on how many measures, with what error? Where are the raw krill
meal data?
lines 243-245: the authors cannot state "...that whale sharks similarly had a peak at large prey
sizes....": the ambient zooplankton communities at the time of observed whale shark feeding had
a peak....

diomedeae populations.
line 322: grammatical issues relating to the line in this sentence - in the context of the foregoing

I am skeptical about the ZooScan results, which are strongly influenced by the quality of the
samples analysed, which by the authors' own admission was often not good. Whilst the authors
may have made an effort to use samples containing the "least digested specimens" of prey - this
may not have been consistent - in digestion state or even place and time of mobulid specimen
capture.

This is an interesting, well written manuscript on a poorly known group of species that are of
wide interest to scientists and the general public and are often subjected to unregulated fishing
pressure which can be especially problematic given their conservative life histories. I don’t see a
direct link between this study and fisheries management, however, and that needs to be better
developed if it is to be retained. I also thought that the characterization of diet composition lacked
rigor and should be revisited to include a measure of abundance (%N) in the diet composition
table and a more detailed treatment of this aspect of the study in the methods. Finally, the term
“resource partitioning” is misused throughout the document and should be addressed. Overall,
however, I think that this manuscript advances our understanding of mobulid trophic ecology
and I expect that it will be worthy of publication after some editing and a bit of additional
analysis/data presentation.
23-24: Basic life history information, yes – but trophic information? How is this important for the
management of mobulids?
44-46: Need to indicate that this is based on the IUCN Red List Assessments.
50-52: How will trophic data help with management? There is no direct link as even most EBFM
approaches do not incorporate trophic considerations, or do so in a very limited way. In your
study region, this is wholly irrelevant to current fisheries management practices, right? Need to
justify this statement.
102: The term “resource partitioning,” oft misused, implies competition for limited resources.
Since this was not directly addressed in the study, a “softer” term – like perhaps “trophic
separation” is more appropriate.
Excellent introduction. Interesting, well-cited, well structured, and well written.
118: No italics on “spp.”
122-130: These are not ideal collection methods but subsampling stomach contents and low
overall sample sizes are understandable given the size of the animals and the scarcity of the
samples. I am concerned, however, that the size of the subsample is extremely small. There was
no analysis done on one or two stomachs to vet this procedure as accurately capturing the
relative composition of the actual stomach contents, and 2.5 ml/2 g seems like to a tiny fraction of
what was likely contained in the stomachs of these rays.
How was diet composition quantified? Sounds like %N but it’s not explained.
4
136-142: They should have all been analyzed “as a whole,” especially given your low sample sizes
and the fact that you started with merely a 2.5 ml subsample. This presents further concerns in
the quality and accuracy of the stomach content data used as a basis for this study.
197: Report the weight of the contents, not the weight of the stomach.
203: Change to “…and 98% of all identified prey items were…”
217-220: This is confusing and no metrics are provided. Is this %N on a pooled basis or a per-
stomach basis (per stomach imparts much more information and fewer biases – and see Moriarity
et al. (CJFAS) 2016 for an interesting “next step” approach to these conventional diet metrics)?
You present count data but refer to weighed stomachs(?). Need to better describe/distinguish
this aspect of data collection/analysis from the more qualitative aspect. How many individual
prey items of each taxon were identified for each species? I don’t know if we are dealing with
thousands of organisms, hundreds…(?).
223: Is this an average? How many E. diomedea did you run for analysis and what was the
variability among samples.
223-227: This seems like an interesting analysis, but not enough basic information was provided
in methods and earlier or developed here to really follow it.
227-228: Indicate that you are provided the low/high range here – reword, and maybe refer to
Fig. 3.
229-230: This seems like an aside as presented. It should be the topic sentence for a separate
paragraph structured as with E. dimomedae.
237: Fig. 4 needs better treatment as it is confusing as presented.
237-241: These are uninteresting results as they are driven by differences in the level of digestion
of the prey items, not the characteristics of the prey items themselves.
246-248: Not your data. This is discussion fodder.
251-258: Better to present this as %N data on a per-stomach basis with a measure of variability.
%Occurrence data aren’t very robust for in describing diet composition.
264: Yes – this is why resource partitioning isn’t the correct term. Dietary overlap works fine here.
Excellent opening paragraph to the discussion.
335: “Hugely abundant” = jargon. Reword.
345: Reword to “Trophic separation,” here and throughout. Resource partitioning is not the
proper term for what is implied.
349-350: This is simply not true. The evidence for resource partitioning in marine fishes is
extremely limited to a few experimental studies that have shown an increase in fitness in one
species in the absence of the other. The study referenced here misuses the term as well. Reword
this section with these thoughts in mind.
376-377: Same problem with habitat partitioning.
416-417: It seems quite an extrapolation from a few empty stomachs to starvation events. Your
argument talks about surviving oligotrophic conditions – but why would a mobuld in the
5
presence of a massive food pulse go into starvation mode? I’d delete this paragraph or posit a
different argument here.
The discussion starts out very well but the sections on Resource Partitioning and the end of the
Energetics section venture beyond the capabilities of the data and results presented and should
be reworked.
Table 1. Good organizational table. Include unit of measure (g) for Stomach contents weight
header.
Table 2. Ok, your index for diet composition is frequency of occurrence. This imparts less
information, but mitigates against the problems and biases that I previously indicated. Since you
have %N data, in some format, you should include it here as well – it imparts far more
information, including variability if calculated on a per stomach basis. “Sp.” should not be
italicized. How are the prey species arranged within group? Seems like they are roughly
arranged alphabetically but better to arrange by %FO. No need to include “Squid beak + flesh” =
Squid.
Fig. 2. Change y-axis label to kilograms (fewer digits needed). It is difficult to distinguish these
species in black and white. Use different symbols or a greater contrast among colors.
Fig. 4. Need a more comprehensible descriptor for the y-axis and a better overall description of
what is being depicted in the caption.
Fig. 5. Need a more comprehensible descriptor for the y-axis and a better overall description of

Comments to the Author(s)

The revision is a much improved document that will be an excellent contribution to the literature
on mobulid feeding ecology with a few minor edits. If not stated below, I was either happy or at
least satisfied with your responses to my prior comments. I look forward to seeing this paper
published.
7-8: There is no link between the fishery information at the onset of the abstract and the trophic
information that follows starting on line 8. There also isn’t any reference to a fishery-management
related result at the end of the abstract. Start with ecological/biological background to fit your
results or restructure the content of the abstract.
34-37: Change to “catch rates for the overall assemblage can stay high…” I agree that this can
happen but there is no link provided that ties this situation back to fisheries management. How is
this information helpful for management?
38: Same problem – How can it help reduce bycatch?
40: Drop “At present.”
45-46: You refer to to M. alfredi here but M. birostris in the prior paragraph, and throughout.
Provide food habitat data on M. birostris instead.
48-49: This is a confusing topic sentences as the second part is incongruous rather than supportive
of the initial portion. The point is that populations of large planktivores are typically vulnerable
to increased mortality (such as that from lethal collection means), so an alternative to the “usual
requirement” is often used, right? Ok. But for this study – the main point of this paragraph is that
you used a variety of techniques that each has benefits and limitations. Construct a topic
paragraph around that idea instead.
51: Change “comparing” to “compare.”
81: This should be “overlap,” not “partitioning.”
105: Change “cut” to “processed” (or “filleted,” if that’s what they did).
136: IRI is a flawed, dated measure. I’d just say “compound index” here, and really that’s not
even necessary.
118-148: I appreciate the added detail in this section. It is much more helpful for interpreting your
results, and for understanding and appreciating the difficulties and limitations in prey
processing.
196-197: Reword “While full stomachs were lacking from some stomach contents that were too
digested.” Awk/confusing.’
227: Change “Their” to “Its.”
The reconstructed Discussion is great. Very interesting, well-substantiated interpreations that
really advance our understanding of the feeding ecology of mobulid ray assemblages. Well done.
12
317-319: Change to “…, and the abundance of basking sharks off England was positively
associated with the size of the dominant local copepod species.” (or something similar –
awkward as constructed).

The revision is a much improved document that will be an excellent contribution to the literature
on mobulid feeding ecology with a few minor edits. If not stated below, I was either happy or at
least satisfied with your responses to my prior comments. I look forward to seeing this paper
published.
7-8: There is no link between the fishery information at the onset of the abstract and the trophic
information that follows starting on line 8. There also isn’t any reference to a fishery-management
related result at the end of the abstract. Start with ecological/biological background to fit your
results or restructure the content of the abstract.
34-37: Change to “catch rates for the overall assemblage can stay high…” I agree that this can
happen but there is no link provided that ties this situation back to fisheries management. How is
this information helpful for management?
38: Same problem – How can it help reduce bycatch?
40: Drop “At present.”
45-46: You refer to to M. alfredi here but M. birostris in the prior paragraph, and throughout.
Provide food habitat data on M. birostris instead.
15
48-49: This is a confusing topic sentences as the second part is incongruous rather than supportive
of the initial portion. The point is that populations of large planktivores are typically vulnerable
to increased mortality (such as that from lethal collection means), so an alternative to the “usual
requirement” is often used, right? Ok. But for this study – the main point of this paragraph is that
you used a variety of techniques that each has benefits and limitations. Construct a topic
paragraph around that idea instead.
51: Change “comparing” to “compare.”
81: This should be “overlap,” not “partitioning.”
105: Change “cut” to “processed” (or “filleted,” if that’s what they did).
136: IRI is a flawed, dated measure. I’d just say “compound index” here, and really that’s not
even necessary.
118-148: I appreciate the added detail in this section. It is much more helpful for interpreting your
results, and for understanding and appreciating the difficulties and limitations in prey
processing.
196-197: Reword “While full stomachs were lacking from some stomach contents that were too
digested.” Awk/confusing.’
227: Change “Their” to “Its.”
The reconstructed Discussion is great. Very interesting, well-substantiated interpreations that
really advance our understanding of the feeding ecology of mobulid ray assemblages. Well done.
317-319: Change to “…, and the abundance of basking sharks off England was positively
associated with the size of the dominant local copepod species.” (or something similar –
awkward as constructed).

Title: “Mobulid rays feed on euphausiids in the Bohol Sea”
We thank the Editor for the opportunity to respond to the Reviewers’ comments. We also thank the
Reviewers for the edits and comments. We have made almost all suggested changes and respond in detail
to the comments (in blue) below. We appreciate the Reviewers’ comments, which have improved this MS
considerably. This input by the two referees has been formally acknowledged (Line 461).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_7
The ms is unexciting and were it not for the fact that information on the diet of these IUCN listed species is
scant, I would recommend publication in a less high profile journal. I have few comments on what is
generally a standard ms, well executed, analysed and interpreted.
ine 129: I must presume the additional, opportunistic samples were collected from the same place at the
same time of year. Is that appropriate?
Changed. We have now clarified that all samples were from the same location and that the opportunistic
samples were collected at a similar time of year (Feb–Jun vs. Feb–May) as the majority of the samples.
Line 111 now reads: “All stomach samples were collected from a mobulid landing site in Jagna…” and line
131: “Additional samples of stomach contents (n=25, 28%) were opportunistically collected between
February and June in 2013 and 2014…”
ine 135/136: What is a small 2.5 ml sample? To my mind, a 2.5 ml sample is already small!
Changed: We have clarified the meaning and Line 137 now reads: “Some 2.5 ml samples contained few
dentifiable specimens…”
ines 173-175: please indicate, in text not by citation alone, the geographic location of the other
zooplankton samples.
Changed. We have added the requested information and Line 177 now reads: “…zooplankton tows taken
during other planktivorous elasmobranch feeding events from Mafia Island in Tanzania and Lady Elliot
Island in Australia [16,17].”
ines 180-183: the correction factor used to convert formalin-preserved material to krill-meal equivalents
(1.144) is based on how many measures, with what error? Where are the raw krill meal data?
Changed. We have now added the requested information and Line 184 now reads: “To compare our values
with the literature, we derived an approximate correction factor (1.144) for formalin-stored samples by
measuring gross energy of krill meal (Norwegian krill meal, Ridley AquaFeeed) preserved in formalin (n=1;
33.22 KJ g-1) and raw (n=1; 37.99 KJ g-1).”
ines 243-245: the authors cannot state "...that whale sharks similarly had a peak at large prey sizes....": the
ambient zooplankton communities at the time of observed whale shark feeding had a peak....
Changed. We have clarified this sentence as suggested and Line 257 now reads: “...shows that whale
shark feeding events occurred when individual prey size was larger than in background samples, while
Manta alfredi zooplankton samples had no such peak during feeding events (figure 5).”
ine 282: a reference is needed to support the statement about the positive effect of upwelling on E
diomedeae populations.
Changed. We now classify the statement as a hypothesis (“likely”) that upwelling could be linked to
ncreased E. diomedeae abundance due to the overlap in season.
ine 322: grammatical issues relating to the line in this sentence - in the context of the foregoing sentence.
Indeed, the latter part of this entire paragraph is poorly written.
Changed. We have re-written the second part of this paragraph to clarify our point, from Line 328: “Many
other large filter feeders also target large-bodied zooplankton prey in high densities. In Manta alfredi, an
historical stomach contents sample from Eastern Australia contained calanoid copepods predominantly,
which were at the large end of the size spectrum for regional zooplankton [10]. Similarly, whale sharks in
Tanzania targeted dense patches of large sergestids in a coastal area otherwise dominated by smaller
copepods [17] and basking sharks, Cetorhinus maximus, in England fed when the copepod community was
dominated by larger species compared to when basking sharks were absent [44]. This trend to large-
bodied prey is not uniform, however, as Manta alfredi targeted dense patches of small copepods in eastern
Australia [16]. This recent example suggests that individual prey size itself may not be important as long as
the prey biomass is high.”
I am skeptical about the ZooScan results, which are strongly influenced by the quality of the samples
analysed, which by the authors' own admission was often not good. Whilst the authors may have made an
effort to use samples containing the "least digested specimens" of prey - this may not have been consistent
- in digestion state or even place and time of mobulid specimen capture.
Comment: Microscopy results show that E. diomedeae was present throughout the samples, and therefore
using only the least digested samples for ZooScan analysis is not problematic – they simply are the
samples that give us the most accurate results comparable to zooplankton tows of intact animals. Further,
the consistency of the peaks and the similar total biovolumes in Fig. 4 for 3 of the 4 species suggests that
the data are meaningful and not highly biased or random because of digestion state.
Table 2 could usefully include information on %N: marine algae are NOT plants: "worm larvae"? polychaete
arvae?
Changed. We changed the table as suggested. We did not add %N because this table includes qualitative
data from scanning the subsample, and is thus not very quantitative. We clarify this in the methods and
Line 144 now reads: “To give a more complete view of their diet, we used these qualitative taxonomic data
to produce a prey list for each mobulid species (table 2), expressed as percent frequency (F O). As this prey
ist is based on qualitative data, we could not calculate percent numerical occurrence (%N).”
Table 3. The legend should stress the 2.5 ml size of the samples used and the authors should think about
how the total biovolume per sample (SBvT) could exceed the total sample volume. Is not ml the same thing
as mm3 - see labels to column titles. Is the length referred to, the average length or the maximum length -
and I must presume that the authors mean zooplankton length and not mobulid!
Changed. Table 3 legend (Line 663) has been edited for clarity that lengths presented are for zooplankton
particles, not mobulid species. We also removed the SBvT values from the table because they are not
comparable between stomach contents and zooplankton tows. We have, however, added the requested
nformation for SBvT for each stomach contents in the raw data sheet (available online). The numbers are
ok, since 1ml = 1,000 mm3.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_8
This is an interesting, well written manuscript on a poorly known group of species that are of wide interest
to scientists and the general public and are often subjected to unregulated fishing pressure which can be
especially problematic given their conservative life histories. I don’t see a direct link between this study and
fisheries management, however, and that needs to be better developed if it is to be retained. I also thought
that the characterization of diet composition lacked rigor and should be revisited to include a measure of
abundance (%N) in the diet composition table and a more detailed treatment of this aspect of the study in
the methods. Finally, the term “resource partitioning” is misused throughout the document and should be
addressed. Overall, however, I think that this manuscript advances our understanding of mobulid trophic
ecology and I expect that it will be worthy of publication after some editing and a bit of additional
analysis/data presentation.
We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments, and address the major points below.
23-24: Basic life history information, yes – but trophic information? How is this important for the
management of mobulids?
Changed. We have added more information in the Introduction on how feeding information can be useful
for manager (see below)
44-46: Need to indicate that this is based on the IUCN Red List Assessments.
Changed as suggested, and line 44 now reads: “Mobula japanica and M. thurstoni are listed as “Near
threatened” on the IUCN Red List…”.
50-52: How will trophic data help with management? There is no direct link as even most EBFM
approaches do not incorporate trophic considerations, or do so in a very limited way. In your study region,
this is wholly irrelevant to current fisheries management practices, right? Need to justify this statement.
Changed. We have elaborated on this in the Introduction, from line 49 onwards: “However, basic biological
knowledge is lacking for most mobulid species, making it difficult to assess and manage mobulid fisheries.
Trophic knowledge can be valuable add-on information for managers, for example if a fishery targets
multiple mobulid species feeding in the same area, catch rates can stay high overall due to abundant
feeding opportunities but the change in abundance of individual species might vary [11]. Further, dietary
nformation can help reduce by-catch [2].”
102: The term “resource partitioning,” oft misused, implies competition for limited resources. Since this was
not directly addressed in the study, a “softer” term – like perhaps “trophic separation” is more appropriate.
Changed as suggested and line 103 now reads: “We investigated trophic separation in the short-term diet
among the four co-occurring species…”.
Excellent introduction. Interesting, well-cited, well structured, and well written.
118: No italics on “spp.”
Changed as suggested.
122-130: These are not ideal collection methods but subsampling stomach contents and low overall sample
sizes are understandable given the size of the animals and the scarcity of the samples. I am concerned,
however, that the size of the subsample is extremely small. There was no analysis done on one or two
stomachs to vet this procedure as accurately capturing the relative composition of the actual stomach
contents, and 2.5 ml/2 g seems like to a tiny fraction of what was likely contained in the stomachs of these
rays.
Comment: We agree that analysing several subsamples from a few stomachs would be a good idea for
similar future work. Nevertheless, we feel confident with our results, because the stomachs appeared to be
a homogenous krill soup (Methods line 127). We visually scanned all whole stomach contents for unusual
prey items of which there were some, such as myctophids in M. birostris, however, the vast majority of all
stomachs was a monoculture of E. diomedeae.
How was diet composition quantified? Sounds like %N but it’s not explained.
Changed. We have now clarified this point throughout the methods and state that we calculated the
frequency of occurrence for table 2 to be able to include all prey items found (Line 144). Quantitative
samples that allow %N calculations were largely E. diomedeae, with not much else, and we think it is more
mportant to include all prey items with an FO rather than a %N of almost only krill.
136-142: They should have all been analyzed “as a whole,” especially given your low sample sizes and the
fact that you started with merely a 2.5 ml subsample. This presents further concerns in the quality and
accuracy of the stomach content data used as a basis for this study.
Comment: We used standard and robust subsampling techniques and feel that we adequately cover the
stomach contents with our methods. Identifying all parts of digested zooplankton in whole stomach
contents was outside the scope of this study because it is extremely time consuming.
197: Report the weight of the contents, not the weight of the stomach.
Changed as suggested and we now report the stomach contents weights in the text. We kept the empty
stomach weights in Figure 2A to contrast them with stomach contents weight to underline the larger feeding
potential in larger animals (Line 203): “Manta birostris was the largest species at up to 552 cm disc width
(table 1), with heaviest stomachs and stomach contents of up to ~5 kg, followed by M. tarapacana, M.
apanica and M. thurstoni (figure 2A). Larger animals had larger stomachs and therefore a higher capacity
for food intake. However, several animals had empty or near-empty stomachs, resulting in a more variable
relationship between stomach contents weight and animal size (figure 2B).
203: Change to “…and 98% of all identified prey items were…”
Changed as suggested.
217-220: This is confusing and no metrics are provided. Is this %N on a pooled basis or a per-stomach
basis (per stomach imparts much more information and fewer biases – and see Moriarity et al. (CJFAS)
2016 for an interesting “next step” approach to these conventional diet metrics)? You present count data
but refer to weighed stomachs(?). Need to better describe/distinguish this aspect of data collection/analysis
from the more qualitative aspect. How many individual prey items of each taxon were identified for each
species? I don’t know if we are dealing with thousands of organisms, hundreds…(?).
Changed as suggested. We now clarify in the methods that we use %N for quantitative data (Line 142),
and we added the per stomach range of %N of krill for all mobula species in the results (Line 255).
223: Is this an average? How many E. diomedea did you run for analysis and what was the variability
among samples.
Changed. We have now added that we measured one sample and could thus not quantify variability.
223-227: This seems like an interesting analysis, but not enough basic information was provided in
methods and earlier or developed here to really follow it.
Changed as suggested. We have now clarified our approach in the Methods by adding more information
(From line 187), and have also clarified the Results section (Line 232)
227-228: Indicate that you are provided the low/high range here – reword, and maybe refer to Fig. 3.
Changed as suggested, and Line 236 now reads: “Krill made up a variable caloric contribution to 100 g of
stomach content, ranging from a minimum mean of 24,572 KJ (20,451 KJ sd) in Manta birostris to a
maximum mean of 40,760 KJ (20,048 KJ sd) in Mobula japanica.”
229-230: This seems like an aside as presented. It should be the topic sentence for a separate paragraph
structured as with E. dimomedae.
Changed as suggested, and we added some more information about the myctophid calorific values (from
Line 241).
237: Fig. 4 needs better treatment as it is confusing as presented.
Changed. We have now modified the figure axes and legend, and have also added more text in the results
to clarify the data in this figure.
237-241: These are uninteresting results as they are driven by differences in the level of digestion of the
prey items, not the characteristics of the prey items themselves.
Changed. We have now deleted these two sentences.
246-248: Not your data. This is discussion fodder.
Changed. We have now deleted this sentence from the results.
251-258: Better to present this as %N data on a per-stomach basis with a measure of variability.
%Occurrence data aren’t very robust for in describing diet composition.
Comment: Prey items other than E. diomedeae were rare and not often found in the quantitative samples
for which it would be possible to calculate a %N. To give a more complete view of the prey items, we opted
to use FO instead from qualitative samples. Line 144: “To give a more complete view of their diet, we used
these qualitative taxonomic data to produce a prey list for each mobulid species (table 2), expressed as
percent frequency (FO). As this prey list is based on qualitative data, we could not calculate percent
numerical occurrence (%N).”
264: Yes – this is why resource partitioning isn’t the correct term. Dietary overlap works fine here.
Excellent opening paragraph to the discussion.
Changed as suggested. We have now removed the term “resource partitioning” throughout the MS.
335: “Hugely abundant” = jargon. Reword.
Changed as suggested, and we deleted “hugely”.
345: Reword to “Trophic separation,” here and throughout. Resource partitioning is not the proper term for
what is implied.
Changed as suggested. We have now removed the term “resource partitioning” in the MS.
349-350: This is simply not true. The evidence for resource partitioning in marine fishes is extremely limited
to a few experimental studies that have shown an increase in fitness in one species in the absence of the
other. The study referenced here misuses the term as well. Reword this section with these thoughts in
mind.
Changed. We have now reworded this section and line 361 reads: “For example, sympatric benthic batoid
ray species have different jaw morphologies that are linked to different efficiencies in capturing different
prey types [49].”
376-377: Same problem with habitat partitioning.
Changed as suggested (Lines 387-395).
416-417: It seems quite an extrapolation from a few empty stomachs to starvation events. Your argument
talks about surviving oligotrophic conditions – but why would a mobuld in the presence of a massive food
pulse go into starvation mode? I’d delete this paragraph or posit a different argument here.
Changed. We clarified our point, as we think the rays move far between food pulses, and the empty
stomachs are an indication of this as they only arrived in the feeding area but then were caught before
capturing prey. We added this to the paragraph, and line 427 now reads: “Those individuals with empty
stomachs are likely to have only recently moved into the area to capitalise on the abundant krill resource,
but had not done so before being captured.”
The discussion starts out very well but the sections on Resource Partitioning and the end of the Energetics
section venture beyond the capabilities of the data and results presented and should be reworked.
Changed. We have now changed the resource partitioning section as suggested earlier and clarified the
energetics part as per above.
Table 1. Good organizational table. Include unit of measure (g) for Stomach contents weight header.
Changed as suggested.
Table 2. Ok, your index for diet composition is frequency of occurrence. This imparts less information, but
mitigates against the problems and biases that I previously indicated. Since you have %N data, in some
format, you should include it here as well – it imparts far more information, including variability if calculated
on a per stomach basis. “Sp.” should not be italicized. How are the prey species arranged within group?
Seems like they are roughly arranged alphabetically but better to arrange by %FO. No need to include
“Squid beak + flesh” = Squid.
Changed. We now present the %N of E. diomedeae in the results as suggested by the Reviewer. We also
arranged the table by FO and then alphabetically, and changed the “sp.” and “squid” as suggested.
Fig. 2. Change y-axis label to kilograms (fewer digits needed). It is difficult to distinguish these species in
black and white. Use different symbols or a greater contrast among colors.
Changed. We now use kg on the y-axis, as suggested. We did not change the colours since the journal is
online only and figures will be in colour.
Fig. 4. Need a more comprehensible descriptor for the y-axis and a better overall description of what is
being depicted in the caption.
Fig. 5. Need a more comprehensible descriptor for the y-axis and a better overall description of what is
being depicted in the caption.
Changed. Figures 4&5, x and y axes have been edited and they now use the same terminology that was
used in the methodology section for the ZooScan protocol.

The revision is a much improved document that will be an excellent contribution to the literature on mobulid
feeding ecology with a few minor edits. If not stated below, I was either happy or at least satisfied with your
responses to my prior comments. I look forward to seeing this paper published.
Thank you for your comments and suggestions.
7-8: There is no link between the fishery information at the onset of the abstract and the trophic information
that follows starting on line 8. There also isn’t any reference to a fishery-management related result at the
end of the abstract. Start with ecological/biological background to fit your results or restructure the content
of the abstract.
Changed as suggested, and line 5 now reads: “Their subsequent vulnerability to overexploitation has
recently been recognised, but fisheries management can be ineffective if it ignores habitat and prey
preferences and other trophic interactions of the target species.”
We have also included a fisheries management related result at the end of the Abstract and line 19 now
reads: “Given the conservative life history of mobulid rays, the identification of foraging grounds that
overlap with fishing activity could be used to inform future fishing effort.”
34-37: Change to “catch rates for the overall assemblage can stay high…” I agree that this can happen but
there is no link provided that ties this situation back to fisheries management. How is this information
helpful for management?
38: Same problem – How can it help reduce bycatch?
Changed. We have now added more information to clafiry this part of the Introduction and line 37 now
reads: “Trophic knowledge can inform ecosystem-based fishery management [11] and can help reduce by-
catch [2] through the identification of critical foraging areas, where the occurrence of target species and
fishing activity overlap. For example, if a fishery targets multiple species feeding in the same area, catch
rates for the overall assemblage can stay high due to abundant feeding opportunities, but changes in
abundance of individual species might vary [12]. The dynamics of multi-species fisheries therefore present
a major problem for setting any total allowable catches of a particular species, and can hinder overall
management across the range of species that are targeted, as it is difficult to predict catch composition
[13].”
40: Drop “At present.”
Changed as suggested.
45-46: You refer to to M. alfredi here but M. birostris in the prior paragraph, and throughout. Provide food
habitat data on M. birostris instead.
Comment: There are no prior stomach contents data on M. birostris, but we opted to add what little
nformation is available for the family Mobulidae in general.
48-49: This is a confusing topic sentences as the second part is incongruous rather than supportive of the
nitial portion. The point is that populations of large planktivores are typically vulnerable to increased
mortality (such as that from lethal collection means), so an alternative to the “usual requirement” is often
used, right? Ok. But for this study – the main point of this paragraph is that you used a variety of
techniques that each has benefits and limitations. Construct a topic paragraph around that idea instead.
Changed as suggested and line 54 now reads: “Recent dietary studies of large planktivores have used
non-lethal methods to infer diet because it is unethical to catch these threatened species and access to
dead specimens has been rare.”
51: Change “comparing” to “compare.”
Changed as suggested.
81: This should be “overlap,” not “partitioning.”
Changed as suggested.
105: Change “cut” to “processed” (or “filleted,” if that’s what they did).
Changed to “processed” as suggested.
136: IRI is a flawed, dated measure. I’d just say “compound index” here, and really that’s not even
necessary.
Changed to “compound index” as suggested.
118-148: I appreciate the added detail in this section. It is much more helpful for interpreting your results,
and for understanding and appreciating the difficulties and limitations in prey processing.
Thank you.
196-197: Reword “While full stomachs were lacking from some stomach contents that were too digested.”
Awk/confusing.’
Changed to “whole specimens” to clarify that they were not intact. Line 202 now reads: “While whole
specimens were lacking from some stomach contents samples that were too digested, these samples
contained at least some diagnostic fragments (antennae, carapace, rostrum and eyes) that allowed species
dentification.”
227: Change “Their” to “Its.”
Changed as suggested.
The reconstructed Discussion is great. Very interesting, well-substantiated interpreations that really
advance our understanding of the feeding ecology of mobulid ray assemblages. Well done.
Thank you.
317-319: Change to “…, and the abundance of basking sharks off England was positively associated with
the size of the dominant local copepod species.” (or something similar – awkward as constructed).
Changed and line 323 now reads: “…and basking sharks, Cetorhinus maximus, in England fed in areas
dominated by larger copepod species compared to where basking sharks were absent [47].”
