Review of the manuscript No early gender effects on energetic status and life history in a
salmonid RSOS-140503 by Regnier et al.
This paper describes comparisons of metabolic rate and energy content of Brown Trout alevins
with the aim of comparing those parameters between males and females. The paper is well
written and the experiments are described and discussed clearly. Although the authors did not
find significant differences between males and females their results are important. Furthermore,
as the authors state in their paper non-significant results are commonly omitted from publication,
but are as important as those that find significant results. Overall the authors have done a good
job on the manuscript.
Below are some comments where there is room for improvement of the manuscript.
Terminology regarding developmental stages of fishes could be greatly improved in the paper.
Salmonids for example do not have larvae, as they do not go through metamorphosis.
Furthermore the word “fry“ has no developmental implications.
There is a mistake in the figure legend in figure 1 where a) and b) are opposite.
The paper needs detailed reading over as the English can in some cases be improved and in some
sentences there are words missing. I would thus suggest a thorough re-reading of the paper by
an native English speaking reader. This is especially true for the result section where some of the
sentences are not written in past tense.

The paper is clear in that regard. The supplementary files are clear as provided, except for

stand-alone as other tables and figures.

Review of RSOS-140503 “No early gender effects on energetic status and life history in a
salmonid”.
The manuscript presents experimental results where the authors tested the relationship between
sex and growth, metabolic rate, and time of emergence in brown trout. Although the subject of
the study is of interest, the authors did not make a clear and compelling case for undertaking this
study – this is of particular importance given that no difference between sexes was found.
Additionally, a great deal of the method description is missing entirely and table 1 is not
referenced in the text. Finally, considering the rather complex statistical analysis described in the
methods, I wonder: where are the corresponding results? Overall, it truly feels as though little
attention was paid to the basic quality of the manuscript. Pity.
INTRODUCTION
Citing non-teleostean literature (refs #1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9) is fine of course, as long as it
contributes to a meaningful background and rationale for conducting the study. I suggest 1)
clarifying in the text that these references are concerned with different taxa, 2) focus on fishes
from the start, and 3) only highlighting the non-teleostean literature if it proposes a solution to a
gap in knowledge in teleosts. The second paragraph (L58-66) is not compelling: too often it is
unclear whether we talk about maturing juveniles, post-metamorphosis juveniles, or newly
hatched larvae. This results in a much too vague paragraph in which it is difficult to discern the
authors’ point with regard to the hypothesis.
I suggest re-writing the introduction starting with the statement on L70 (since that’s really what
the study is about), then presenting the background and knowledge gaps focusing on teleosts,
which should lead to the hypothesis detailed on L77-81. Most importantly, some space should be
spent explaining why sexual differences could be expected prior to the determination of
phenotypic sex.
Although this is a bit clearer, the value of the sdY method should be highlighted in terms of why
exactly couldn’t have this study been done before. Similarly, the rationale for using a factorial
crossing (L87) is not immediately clear, since parental effect is not discussed at all in the
introduction.
MATERIAL & METHODS
There are a number of critical short-comings in the description of the methods. Sampling of wild
broodstock is not described, as well as any conditioning prior to stripping. The reason for using
12 females and 4 males should be stated, and how the 48 potential families were managed. Fifty
(why 50?) eggs/female were used (again, were families tracked or not?), from which up to 8 fry
were randomly selected? Whether it ends up being 8 fry per female broodstock is not clear. Also,
the “up to” implies that some groups had fewer fry: what was the lowest number of individual in
a group? Is this number sufficient to obtain a sample representative of the population?
CHNSO must be defined, and methods of measurement described. Similarly, the respirometry
protocol is too important in this experiment to be left out completely. Merely citing a reference is
not sufficient. Description of genotyping method is appropriate.
According to the methods, wild fish were sampled and spawned late 2008 and the experiment
conducted in (early?) 2009. However, identification of the sdY and its use in establishing the
genomic sex of an individual was only published in 2012. Were the samples stored for extended
periods of time (several years)? What was the timing of the various analyses (elemental analyses,
MR, and genomic) with regard to the sampling date? If samples were indeed stored for such a
long time, it must be stated and storage conditions must be described.
4
The relative metabolic rate based on residuals: this approach is neither common nor intuitive. I
assume that residuals are taken as the remaining variance unexplained by the weight of the
individual? However, by definition, the residuals are centered on zero. Thus this approach needs
more explanation and justification to use as a meaningful and reliable variable.
Statistical analysis: emergence timing is a “time to event” variable, hence a non-normal variable.
Linear mixed model still assumes normality of the variables, and therefore is not appropriate in
this case. A generalized linear mixed model would be more appropriate. Additionally, given the
way that results are presented (or rather, not presented), I don’t see where the stepwise
regression was used, and which variables were taken out of the model, if any.
RESULTS
L144: this relates back to the previous comment on the use of residuals of metabolic rate. What is
the biological meaning of a negative “mass-specific metabolic rate”?.... How is this number
interpreted exactly?
Instead of presenting the results in a decidedly indigestible and never-ending litany of means,
SD, F- and P-values (L139-153), why not presenting them in a table?
DISCUSSION
L181: this “feeling” is quite colloquial. Surely the authors can be more affirmative in their
interpretation of their data.
L196: which species of Pacific salmon? Be more specific!
Table 1: as mentioned above, it is not referenced in the text. I assume that “a” is a constant, and
therefore that Logit (is it a logit link?) of sex ratio is a constant, and therefore, that the model is
not significant? Although this looks like a stepwise regression, I don’t see where in the methods
the authors describe a logit link on sex ration against parentage. Clearly, there is a great need for
more explanation.

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-140503)
Dear Editor of Royal Society Open Science,
We are pleased to resubmit our manuscript ‘No gender effect on energetic status and early life
history in brown trout (Salmo trutta).’ and hope you will consider it for peer-review and
publication in Royal Society Open Science.
The concerns raised after the first review were addressed and you will find them listed below:
1- “Please also include a section on ethics which states that no ethical approval was required at
the time of the study but that the experimental procedures fully complied with your institute's
ethical rules as well as with French laws. Please also state that no specific licences were required
but that all researchers involved were experienced in handling fish. “
This section has been included in Material and Methods
Reviewer: 1
2- “Terminology regarding developmental stages of fishes could be greatly improved in the
paper. Salmonids for example do not have larvae, as they do not go through metamorphosis.
Furthermore the word “fry“ has no developmental implications”
These terminology issues were corrected.
3- “There is a mistake in the figure legend in figure 1 where a) and b) are opposite.”
The figure has been changed to conform with concerns also raised by reviewer 2.
4- “The paper needs detailed reading over as the English can in some cases be improved and in
8
some sentences there are words missing. I would thus suggest a thorough re-reading of the paper
by an native English speaking reader.”
The manuscript has been revised and benefited from a re-reading by a native speaker.
Reviewer: 2
5- “a great deal of the method description is missing entirely and table 1 is not referenced in the
text. Finally, considering the rather complex statistical analysis described in the methods, I
wonder: where are the corresponding results? Overall, it truly feels as though little attention was
paid to the basic quality of the manuscript. Pity.”
This was unfortunate, as it corresponded to a test removed due to lack of statistical power. The
part referred to by reviewer 2 should not have been present at the first submission.
6- “Citing non-teleostean literature (refs #1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9) is fine of course, as long as it
contributes to a meaningful background and rationale for conducting the study. I suggest 1)
clarifying in the text that these references are concerned with different taxa, 2) focus on fishes
from the start, and 3) only highlighting the non-teleostean literature if it proposes a solution to a

unclear whether we talk about maturing juveniles, post-metamorphosis juveniles, or newly
hatched larvae. This results in a much too vague paragraph in which it is difficult to discern the
authors’ point with regard to the hypothesis. I suggest re-writing the introduction starting with
the statement on L70 (since that’s really what the study is about), then presenting the background
and knowledge gaps focusing on teleosts, which should lead to the hypothesis detailed on L77-
81. Most importantly, some space should be spent explaining why sexual differences could be

the sdY method should be highlighted in terms of why exactly couldn’t have this study been
done before. Similarly, the rationale for using a factorial crossing (L87) is not immediately clear,
since parental effect is not discussed at all in the introduction.”
We followed this advice, refocused the introduction on teleosts from the start of the introduction
and avoided non-teleost literature when not necessary. The introduction has been clarified
according to this guidance.
7- “There are a number of critical short-comings in the description of the methods. Sampling of
wild broodstock is not described, as well as any conditioning prior to stripping. The reason for
using 12 females and 4 males should be stated, and how the 48 potential families were managed.”
Methods section has been revised accordingly and a table with parental traits (Table 1) has been
included.
8- “Also, the “up to” implies that some groups had fewer fry: what was the lowest number of
individual in a group? Is this number sufficient to obtain a sample representative of the
population?”
This has been clarified in the text. The restriction to 8 individuals per day was imposed by the
number of micro-respirometry chambers (detailed in the text) therefore sample size was not
enough to focus on female effects but were accounted for as random effects in the analyses.
9-“ CHNSO must be defined, and methods of measurement described. Similarly, the
respirometry protocol is too important in this experiment to be left out completely. Merely citing
a reference is not sufficient. Description of genotyping method is appropriate.”
These protocols have been defined in the material section.
10-“ According to the methods, wild fish were sampled and spawned late 2008 and the
experiment conducted in (early?) 2009. However, identification of the sdY and its use in
establishing the genomic sex of an individual was only published in 2012. Were the samples
stored for extended periods of time (several years)? What was the timing of the various analyses
(elemental analyses, MR, and genomic) with regard to the sampling date? If samples were indeed
stored for such a long time, it must be stated and storage conditions must be described.”

This is now mentioned in the text and the timing of procedures is now clear in the text, as well as
storage conditions.
11- “The relative metabolic rate based on residuals: this approach is neither common nor
intuitive. I assume that residuals are taken as the remaining variance unexplained by the weight
of the individual? However, by definition, the residuals are centered on zero. Thus this approach
needs more explanation and justification to use as a meaningful and reliable variable.
… this relates back to the previous comment on the use of residuals of metabolic rate. What is the
biological meaning of a negative “mass-specific metabolic rate”?.... How is this number
interpreted exactly?”
This approach has been commonly used for metabolic rate in fish, details are now given in the
text as well as references for this method.
12- “Statistical analysis: emergence timing is a “time to event” variable, hence a non-normal
variable. Linear mixed model still assumes normality of the variables, and therefore is not

accordingly.
13-“ Instead of presenting the results in a decidedly indigestible and never-ending litany of
means, SD, F- and P-values (L139-153), why not presenting them in a table?”
This advice has been followed and the result section has been revised accordingly, model results
are now presented in Table 2.
14- “L181: this “feeling” is quite colloquial. Surely the authors can be more affirmative in their
interpretation of their data.”

This section has been removed and the manuscript revised accordingly.
We are very grateful to the reviewers for their constructive comments and thus we hope the

Review of RSOS-150441 “No early gender effects on energetic status and life history in a
salmonid”.
This is a resubmission of RSOS 140503 under the same title. The manuscript has been much
improved since then, though some questions and possible improvement remain. Primarily,
justification must be given as to running this experiment prior to the determination of phenotypic
sex. Indeed the authors are looking for a phenotypic effect (composition, metabolic rate, etc.) of
sex before sex has been phenotypically determined.
Introduction
Not that introductions are otherwise trivial, it is of particular importance in this particular case
where negative results are presented. The authors have significantly improved this section
compared to the previous submission with much increased focus on the teleost literature.
However, the central question of the manuscript concerns sexual differences in embryonic and
early larval development. The first paragraph starts with considerations relative to emergence,
but finishes with citations pertaining to sexual dimorphism in mature adults. Though I
understand such differences are probably the best-known when it comes to fishes, it is not the
matter of this paper.
The second paragraph highlights the scarcity of data pertaining to sexual differences in larvae
(L65-68); however, no details are given whatsoever about that data. I think this particular points
needs to be develop in order to justify the main hypothesis and make a compelling case for
testing the hypothesis in the first place. I suggest developing this point as early as possible in the
manuscript, and then follow the ontogenic chronology – larval, juvenile (L78), adult dimorphism
(L56-63).
The introduction should also bring some information about the endogenous/environmental
factors and timing of the phenotypical determination of sex, and why sexual differences could be
expected before this determination occurs.
Material and methods
L102: fifty eggs, rather? Or larvae if they were moved after hatching (hopefully not). But juvenile
assumes a post-metamorphosis stage.
L108: “over the entire emergence period”. Please indicate the duration.
L113-116: this remains unclear to me, and the problem may be the use of “residuals”. Residuals
are the portion of data unexplained by a given model, and are minimized during the fitting
process. Therefore they are a measure of the model’s error and do not represent biological data.
Did you fit MR vs. dry weight for the entire population, and then plot specific individuals
compared to this population average, the relative MR of this individual being the distance
between the actual individual MR and the population’s average? In that case, this is clearly not a
residual.
L118: describe euthanasia methodology.
12
L128: “samples were stored in a refrigerator”. Indicate the temperature as well as sample
processing and conditioning methods used to ensure that DNA is properly stabilized for the
storage period (3 years) with minimum degradation.
L149-152: this is not clear. Sex-ratio is a continuous variable, not binomial. In my opinion, the
statistical analysis would compare time-to-event between males and female, much like a time-to-
event mortality curve in a disease challenge. In that case, sex is the independent variable, and
emergence day (or time to emergence) is the dependent variable. Also, I suggest spelling out
GLM (L150): not only it should be defined, but also it should not be confused with the popular
proc GLM of the SAS software, which really is not a general linear model.
L155: If eggs were incubated in separate emergence box for each dame (L102), could this random
factor be confused with a box effect?
Results
This section has been much improved since the previous draft. However, I cannot match the p-
values given in the text (L172 and 174) to those shown in table 2. It seems that some results given
in the text are not presented in tables? E.g. L174-175.
As mentioned in the previous review, I suggest that all results are presented in tables/figures,
and the text only highlights the statistical interpretation along with important numbers.
Table 2a: what is the n=23? Also, I do not understand the meaning of the odds ratio estimate: did
all larvae emerge on day 1??
Figure 1: the letters of the 4 graphs are not very easily seen, in my opinion. Please also add p-
value and R2.
Discussion
L193-196: It is indeed possible, but how likely, given that sdY was known and available only in
2012?
L213-222: all good points, which bring us back to the justification of the study. Also, L216-218
“Most studies revealing …” for which the Yamamoto 2004 masu salmon paper is cited in support.
This is an experimental paper, not a review, and therefore not the best citation to support “most
studies”, especially if citing a contradicting paper #35.

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-150441)
See Appendix A.
Appendix A
Response to Referees:
Comments to the Author(s)
Review of RSOS-150441 “No early gender effects on energetic status and life history in a
salmonid”.
1-This is a resubmission of RSOS 140503 under the same title. The manuscript has been
much improved since then, though some questions and possible improvement remain.
Primarily, justification must be given as to running this experiment prior to the determination
of phenotypic sex. Indeed the authors are looking for a phenotypic effect (composition,
metabolic rate, etc.) of sex before sex has been phenotypically determined.
Response-The introduction has been modified according to this comment
Introduction
2-Not that introductions are otherwise trivial, it is of particular importance in this particular
case where negative results are presented. The authors have significantly improved this
section compared to the previous submission with much increased focus on the teleost
literature. However, the central question of the manuscript concerns sexual differences in
embryonic and early larval development. The first paragraph starts with considerations
relative to emergence, but finishes with citations pertaining to sexual dimorphism in mature
adults. Though I understand such differences are probably the best-known when it comes to
fishes, it is not the matter of this paper.
The second paragraph highlights the scarcity of data pertaining to sexual differences in larvae
(L65-68); however, no details are given whatsoever about that data. I think this particular
points needs to be develop in order to justify the main hypothesis and make a compelling case
for testing the hypothesis in the first place. I suggest developing this point as early as possible
in the manuscript, and then follow the ontogenic chronology – larval, juvenile (L78), adult
dimorphism (L56-63).
Response- The introduction has been modified accordingly, the point has been developed and
the proposed ontogeny chronology has been adopted
3-The introduction should also bring some information about the endogenous/environmental
factors and timing of the phenotypical determination of sex, and why sexual differences could
be expected before this determination occurs.
Response- The introduction and reference were modified according to the comments above
Material and methods
4-L102: fifty eggs, rather? Or larvae if they were moved after hatching (hopefully not). But
juvenile assumes a post-metamorphosis stage.
Response- “Larvae”, modified in the text. Introducing larvae at this stage had no effect on
mortality or emergence behaviour.
5-L108: “over the entire emergence period”. Please indicate the duration.
Response- 25 days, included in the text
6-L113-116: this remains unclear to me, and the problem may be the use of “residuals”.
Residuals are the portion of data unexplained by a given model, and are minimized during the
fitting process. Therefore they are a measure of the model’s error and do not represent
biological data. Did you fit MR vs. dry weight for the entire population, and then plot specific
individuals compared to this population average, the relative MR of this individual being the
distance between the actual individual MR and the population’s average? In that case, this is
clearly not a residual.
Response-This has been clarified in the text, the term residual is now avoided.
7-L118: describe euthanasia methodology.
Response-Euthanasia is described in the ethical note
8-L128: “samples were stored in a refrigerator”. Indicate the temperature as well as sample
processing and conditioning methods used to ensure that DNA is properly stabilized for the
storage period (3 years) with minimum degradation.
Response-Information is now given in the text concerning the integrity of preserved DNA
9-L149-152: this is not clear. Sex-ratio is a continuous variable, not binomial. In my opinion,
the statistical analysis would compare time-to-event between males and female, much like a
time-to-event mortality curve in a disease challenge. In that case, sex is the independent
variable, and emergence day (or time to emergence) is the dependent variable. Also, I suggest
spelling out GLM (L150): not only it should be defined, but also it should not be confused
with the popular proc GLM of the SAS software, which really is not a general linear model.
Response-This has been clarified in the text, sex ratio is the proportion of male in the sample
and as a grouped binary data, assumed to follow a binomial distribution
10-10-L155: If eggs were incubated in separate emergence box for each dame (L102), could
this random factor be confused with a box effect?
Response-Information is now given in the text: All eggs were incubated in a similar
environment; larvae originating from a given female were transferred to 4 different
emergence box, randomly disposed in the artificial stream in order to minimize position
effect, replicates from a given female behaved similarly.
Results
11-This section has been much improved since the previous draft. However, I cannot match
the p-values given in the text (L172 and 174) to those shown in table 2. It seems that some
results given in the text are not presented in tables? E.g. L174-175.
As mentioned in the previous review, I suggest that all results are presented in tables/figures,
and the text only highlights the statistical interpretation along with important numbers.
Response-As now clarified in the methods, these first results are simply goodness of fit tests
and as such are mentioned only in the text.
12-Table 2a: what is the n=23? Also, I do not understand the meaning of the odds ratio
estimate: did all larvae emerge on day 1??
Response-These values and interpretation are now clarified in the Table caption
13-Figure 1: the letters of the 4 graphs are not very easily seen, in my opinion. Please also
add p-value and R2.
Response-The graph have been modified to make the letters more visible. However, as there
is no agreement on how variance associated with random effects are to be included and
decomposed in linear mixed effect models, p values and R2 are not provided, instead, Table 2
provides the useful information.
Discussion
14-L193-196: It is indeed possible, but how likely, given that sdY was known and available
only in 2012?
Response-In previous studies like the one by Jonsson 1989, fish were maintained until the
age at which sex could be visually identified, it is now clarified in the text.
15-L213-222: all good points, which bring us back to the justification of the study. Also,
L216-218 “Most studies revealing …” for which the Yamamoto 2004 masu salmon paper is
cited in support. This is an experimental paper, not a review, and therefore not the best
citation to support “most studies”, especially if citing a contradicting paper #35.
Response-This has been removed according to the comment
