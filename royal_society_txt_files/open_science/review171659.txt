This is an interesting paper on a complex group of chemicals. The method developed uses a
relatively insensitive and very non-specific detector. for what are very difficult analytes. The
problem with thiols is their ready conversion to disulphides and their poor recovery from
matrices and these points have not been addressed in the paper. I can see no recovery data from
actual extracts by spiking before processing nor have extracts been spiked immediately before
chromatography. There is no mention in the paper of disulphides or their chromatography.

In this manuscript entitled ‘Development of HPLC-ELSD method for determination of
phytochelatins, cysteine and glutathione in Perilla frutescens under cadmium stress condition’,
3
the authors presented an HPLC-ELSD method for determination of phytochelatins, cysteine, and
glutathione, and the application of this method to analysis of Perilla frutescens. The topic of this
manuscript may be interesting to researchers in related fields. However, it needs some
improvement before acceptance for publication. My detailed comments are as follows: 1. As
far as I know, it is a novel method to detect phytochelatins, cysteine, and glutathione in plants
using HPLC-ELSD, though it warrants further investigation in a variety of plants to make sure
the reliability of this methodology. 2. This manuscript needs to be edited more carefully by
authors, for there are so many sentence structural/grammatical/ spelling mistakes. Taking the
part of ‘Abstract’ as example, the first letter of ‘Phytochelatins’ in the 1st sentence should be
converted to lowercase; the first letter of ‘Venusil’ in the 2nd sentence should be converted to
uppercase; the same verb tense should be used throughout; in 2nd sentence, I think it may be
better if ‘Separated by baseline’ could be changed to ‘separated with baseline separation’. 3.
Some description should be revised carefully to make it clear to the reader. For example, in the
3rd sentence of the part of ‘Abstract’, please tell the reader what solvent is ‘A’; in the 13th line
from the top of page 2, the sentence of ‘The PCs could be induced to synthesize by a variety of
metal ions’ could be modified to ‘The PCs could be synthesized by PCS induced by a variety of
metal ions’. 4. In the 3rd paragraph from the top of page 4, there is something wrong with the
logical relationship. The analysis time is more than 20 min using 30% ACN, so do you think it is
possible that the analysis time could be shorten using 10% - 30% ACN? 5. The authors may write
the part of discussion in more detail.

of phytochelatins and glutathione, and the application of this method to analysis of Perilla

for publication in RSOS. Indeed, authors expressed more clearly than in last version. However, I
thought they could do much better and revise it more carefully.

what the ‘Six analytes’ are.
2. Page 1 Line 38, ‘0.1% trifluoroacetic acid’: It is not described precisely. It should be 0.1%

Appendix A
Response to Reviewer 1:
Many thanks for your suggestion.
1. The problem with thiols is their ready conversion to disulphides and their poor
recovery from matrices and these points have not been addressed in the paper. I can
see no recovery data from actual extracts by spiking before processing nor have
extracts been spiked immediately before chromatography. There is no mention in the
paper of disulphides or their chromatography.
Answer: Dithiotreietol (DTT), commonly used as reducing agents, was added as
stabilizers of PCs in the course of sample preparation considering the problem that
thiols is quickly converted to disulphides and poor recovery may be obtained from
matrices.( [1] Bardarov K, Naydenov M, Djingova R. HPLC–HRMS method for fast

2. p2 line 26 protected I think should read protected from
Answer: The sentence “After the degradation of PCs, the heavy metals are retained in
vacuole, which the plant cells can be protected” has been revised as “After the
degradation of PCs, the heavy metal ions are retained in vacuole, from which the plant
cells can be protected”.
3. Give supplier of the HPLC column
Answer: The supplier of the HPLC column has been added in the revised manuscript.
4. p3 line 50 barely does not made sense here
Answer: The sentence “The concentration of Cd(<U+2161>) in hydroponic solution is 5
mg·L-1” has been deleted in the revised manuscript.
5. p3 line 56 freezer not refrigerator
Answer: “refrigerator ” has been corrected as “freezer”.
In addition, we try to correct the mistakes in our paper, and do our best to improve the
English of the whole paper.
6. p4 26 to shorten analysis times it is usually better to use a shorter column this is
especially so with gradient elution. Was this approach considered?
Answer: The gradient elution technique possesses some merits in the separation of
mixed organic compounds. The peaks whose retention time is low will appear later
via an eluent of low organic phase - high water phase so as to separate the mixed
organic compounds; while the peaks whose retention time is high will appear in
advance via an eluent of high organic phase - low water phase. The utilization of this
technique can not only save time, but also can make the peaks narrower, thus make
the integration of the peaks more accurate.
7. Fig 2 meaning of a & b is not clear. the tracings should be farther apart.
Answer: Fig. 2 has been redrew in the revised manuscript.
Response to Reviewer 2:
Thanks for the reviewer’s comment.
1. As far as I know, it is a novel method to detect phytochelatins, cysteine, and
glutathione in plants using HPLC-ELSD, though it warrants further investigation in a
variety of plants to make sure the reliability of this methodology.
Answer: GSH and PCs in the roots of rice under cadmium stress and non-stress
conditions were also determined by HPLC-ELSD to verify the reliability of this
methodology. The test results also manifest that the developed HPLC-ELSD method
can detect quantitatively for the GSH and PCs in real samples. The contents of this
section has been added in revised manuscript.
2. This manuscript needs to be edited more carefully by authors, for there are so many
sentence structural/grammatical/ spelling mistakes. Taking the part of ‘Abstract’ as
example, the first letter of ‘Phytochelatins’ in the 1st sentence should be converted to
lowercase; the first letter of ‘Venusil’ in the 2nd sentence should be converted to
uppercase; the same verb tense should be used throughout; in 2nd sentence, I think it
may be better if ‘Separated by baseline’ could be changed to ‘separated with baseline
separation’.
Answer: We do our best to improve the English of the whole paper, some format
errors, grammatical errors and awkward sentences have been corrected in revised
manuscript.
3. Some description should be revised carefully to make it clear to the reader. For
example, in the 3rd sentence of the part of ‘Abstract’, please tell the reader what
solvent is ‘A’; in the 13th line from the top of page 2, the sentence of ‘The PCs could
be induced to synthesize by a variety of metal ions’ could be modified to ‘The PCs
could be synthesized by PCS induced by a variety of metal ions’.
Answer: Solvent is ‘A’ and ‘B’ have been illustrated and the sentence ‘The PCs could
be induced to synthesize by a variety of metal ions’ has been corrected as ‘PCs could
be rapidly synthesized by the induction of heavy metal ions’. Some sentences in the
first paragraph of the section “sample preparation” have been corrected in order to
make the meaning clearer and the detailed solid-phase extraction procedure has been
added in the revised paper.
4. In the 3rd paragraph from the top of page 4, there is something wrong with the
logical relationship. The analysis time is more than 20 min using 30% ACN, so do
you think it is possible that the analysis time could be shorten using 10% - 30% ACN?
Answer: I really appreciate your questions. We have a mistake that a best separation
is found when the proportion of acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA is 10:90 (V:V), which has
been revised in the revised manuscript.
5. The authors may write the part of discussion in more detail.
Answer: We do our best to discuss the results in more detail in the revised
manuscript.
Thanks a lot for your kindly help. If you still have other questions, please do not
hesitate to contact us.

Appendix B
Response to Reviewer 2:
Many thanks for your suggestion. The whole manuscript has been carefully checked.
Revisions in the manuscript are highlighted as red font. The comments raised by the
reviewer are answered one by one as follows:
1. Page 1 Line 35, ‘Six analytes’: I think it will be better if authors could tell readers
in Abstract what the ‘Six analytes’ are.
Answer: ‘Six analytes’ has been replaced with ‘GSH, Phytochelatin 2 (PC2),
phytochelatin 3 (PC3), phytochelatin 4 (PC4), phytochelatin 5 (PC5) and phytochelatin
6 (PC6) ’ in the abstract.
2. Page 1 Line 38, ‘0.1% trifluoroacetic acid’: It is not described precisely. It should
be 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water or water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.
Answer: ‘0.1% trifluoroacetic acid’ has been corrected as ‘water containing 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid’.
3. Page 1 Line 44, ‘0.2 to 0.5’: This range occurs at Page 6 Line 23 with ‘0.15 to 0.86’,
not consistent.
Answer: The confirmation of detection limits range from 0.2 to 0.5 µg·mL-1. ‘0.15 to
0.86 µmol·L-1’ in page 6 line 23 has been revised as ‘0.2 to 0.5 µg·mL-1 ’.
4. Page 2 Line 37, I think there is a grammar mistake here. It should be ‘mechanisms’
but not ‘literatures’ which can be reported.
Answer: ‘literatures’ in Page 2 Line 37 has been corrected as ‘mechanisms’.
5. Page 2 Line 54, ‘Although these … determination of PCs;’: I don’t think it is a
exact description, and I think this sentence can be deleted.
Answer: The sentence (Although these … determination of PCs) in Page 2 Line 54
has been deleted.
6. Page 3 Line 9, ‘quietly’
Answer: ‘quietly’ has been corrected as ‘quite’.
7. Page 3 Line 37, ‘suprapure’
Answer: The word ‘suprapure’ ( Page 3 Line 37) is redundant and has been deleted in
the revised manuscript.
8. Page 4 Line 12: I think it will be better if changing ‘at a flow rate’ to ‘at the flow
rate’, and ‘injected volume’ to ‘injection volume’.
Answer: Page 4 Line 12: ‘at a flow rate’ has been corrected as ‘at the flow rate’, and
‘injected volume’ has been corrected as ‘injection volume’.
9. Page 5, the section of ‘3.1. Method optimization’: The tense used in this section is
confusing. From my understanding, authors were describing their work on
optimization in this section. As such, past tense should be used.
Answer: The tense used in the section of ‘3.1. Method optimization’ has been revised
as past tense.
10. Page 6 Line 12: ‘increases’ to ‘increase’
Answer: ‘increases’ has been corrected as ‘increase’.
11. Page 6 Line 21 and 23: I can’t find ‘0.9908’ and ‘0.15 to 0.86’ from Table 1.
Answer: As the calibration curves have been remade in resubmitted manuscript, so
the new calibration curves has been revised in Table 1, however, we did not corrected
in the manuscript. We have corrected the correlation coefficients and detection limits
in the section 3.2 (Calibration curves, linear ranges and detection limits).
12. Page 6 Line 42: I can’t find ‘3.6 %’ from Table 3
Answer: ‘3.6 %’ has been corrected as ‘1.5 %’.
13. Page 7 Line 4: ‘are’ to ‘were’
Answer: ‘are’ has been corrected as ‘were’.
14. Page 7 Line 15-17: I think it will be better if authors can write it clearly how they
carried out recovery tests, rather than let readers seek from Table 6 by themselves.
Answer: The recovery tests has been described in detail in the manuscript.
15. Page 7 Line 19: ‘satisfactory’ is an adjective.
Answer: It has been corrected in the manuscript.
16. Page 6, the section of ‘3.4. Real sample analysis’: How many times was this
experiment repeated? n=? SD=?
Answer: The experiments has been repeated for three times and the data of SD has
been added in the Table 6.
17. Please have someone with good English grammatical skills carefully proof-read
this manuscript.
Answer: We try to correct the mistakes in our paper, and do our best to improve the
English of the whole paper.
Thanks a lot for your kindly help. If you still have other questions, please do not

checked. Revisions in the manuscript are highlighted as red font. The comments
raised by the reviewer are answered one by one as follows:
(1). Page 2 Line 34: Please don’t just replace the word of ‘literatures’ with
‘mechanisms’. Please be more careful. Read the sentence and revise it.
Answer: It has been corrected in the manuscript.
(2) Page 2 Line 42: There is a grammar mistake in the sentence of ‘So, the
determination of PCs …’.
Answer: ‘So, the determination of PCs …’(Page 2 Line 42) has been revised as ‘So,
the concentration determination of PCs in Perilla frutescens is of great practical
importance to reveal the mechanism of Cd(II) tolerance and detoxification in Perilla
frutescens. ’
(3) Page 4 Line 4: ‘0.1% trifluoroacetic acid water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid (0.1% TFA, B)’.
Answer: ‘0.1% trifluoroacetic acid water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%
TFA, B)’ has been corrected as ‘water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (0.1% TFA,
B).’
(4) Page 4 line 13: 1.5 m L·min-1, please check the unit.
Answer: ‘ 1.5 m L·min-1 ‘has been corrected as ‘ 1.5 L·min-1’
(5) Regarding the tense in this manuscript, only those used to describe authors’ work
need to be changed to past tense. For example, Page 5 Line 24: why do you use past
tense for the 1st sentence in Page 5 Paragraph 2?
