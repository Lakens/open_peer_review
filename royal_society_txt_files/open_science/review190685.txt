This paper investigated the synthesis and characterization of drug-loaded microspheres from
carboxymethyl cellulose and soy protein isolate. It is found that the AVM loaded microspheres
demonstrated more wettability on the leaf surface than AVM solution. Furthermore, SPC@AVM
also prevented UV photolysis when exposed to UV light. The experiments were carried out using
established methods, and the results support the conclusions. Publication after minor revision is
suggested.
1. The authors used FTIR analysis of prove the successful preparation of SPC. Obviously, this is a
weak point. FTIR only provide a quantitative analysis for the samples. The yield and polymer
structure of SPC were not provided from this characterization. More characterizations are
suggested to be carried out and more discussions are added in the manuscript.
2. The authors claimed that the initial decomposition temperatures of SPI, CMC, and SPC were
160 ° C, 188 ° C, and 232 ° C, respectively. Please check these conclusions and figure 3b. It seems
that SPC demonstrate a low thermal stability than other two samples. By the way, how the
authors define the initial decomposition temperatures?
3. The sustained release of different SPC@AVM composites in Figure 7 seems to show slightly
difference. But the error bars for each data point are suggested to be added in the Figure 7. The
same revisions also should be made in Figure 8.
4. The author claimed that a single glass transition in the DSC heating curves indicated that SPI
and CMC were highly compatible. These conclusions are questionable. Each curve in Figure 3 (d)
shows a wide and broad peak. Are you sure this is only a single peak? If this is the truth, please
provide the purity of SPC.

This paper describes a natural nano-composites by self-assembly with soy protein isolate (SPI)
and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) for efficiently loading, protecting and releasing pesticide
AVM. Briefly, the manuscript had a clear thought, the preparation process and result analysis are
detailed, and the project shows great potentials in agricultural production. However, there were
still some questions needs to be improved and detailed comments are the following:
1. In this paper, CMC was grafted onto SPI, thus, the graft ratio needs to be given.
2. The author using the UV absorption to measure AVM content, and the standard curve seems to
be the same in ‘2.5 Encapsulation efficiency’ and ‘2.6 Protection against UV light’. Please carefully
check.
3. Page 8 line 5, what means ‘...CMC is a lo4ng-chain polymer...’
4. In Fig. 5d-5f, one transverse captions should be used.
5. In Fig. 7a, the pH value of release is missing; In Fig. 7b-f, please give the specific type of
SPC@AVM sample.
6. In toxicity analysis, the LC50 value of UV/SPC@AVM is higher than that of AVM solution,
however, the reason is not clear. It may be degradation loss by UV irradiation or the slow-release
from composites. The SPC@AVM group should be used to illustrate this point.

Appendix A
Dear. Editors and Reviewers:
We appreciate the time and detailed suggestions provided by each reviewer and have
incorporated the suggested changes into the manuscript to the best of our ability. We have
responded specifically to each suggestion below. All changes made to the manuscript
(Manuscript Number: RSOS-190685) are marked in the revised manuscript.
Reviewers' comments and our answers
Comments of Reviewer #1:
This paper investigated the synthesis and characterization of drug-loaded microspheres from
carboxymethyl cellulose and soy protein isolate. It is found that the AVM loaded microspheres
demonstrated more wettability on the leaf surface than AVM solution. Furthermore, SPC@AVM
also prevented UV photolysis when exposed to UV light. The experiments were carried out using
established methods, and the results support the conclusions. Publication after minor revision is
suggested.
1. The authors used FTIR analysis of prove the successful preparation of SPC. Obviously, this is a
weak point. FTIR only provide a quantitative analysis for the samples. The yield and polymer
structure of SPC were not provided from this characterization. More characterizations are
suggested to be carried out and more discussions are added in the manuscript.
Answer: Thanks for reviewer’s advice. We have made a quantitative analysis of the
grafting ratio of CMC on SPI. After completion of the reaction between SPI and CMC, the
pH of the solution was adjusted to 4.5 (isoelectric point of SPI) by hydrochloric acid, and
the suspension was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was
removed, freeze-dried for 24 hours. The graft ratio (GR) was calculated according to the
formula (1). AS shown in table 1, in SPC-11, SPC-41, and SPC-81, the grafting ratio of CMC
on SPI were 148.12%, 36.12%, and 19.23%, respectively. Besides, we utilized SDS-PAGE
analysis to compare the molecular weight of SPC and also confirmed the formation of
SPC.
GR <U+F03D> m2 / (m1 <U+F02D> m3 ) (1)
Where, m2 is the feeding amount of CMC, m1 is the feeding amount of SPI, and m3 is the
mass of SPI not reacting with CMC.
Table 1 Graft ratio of CMC on SPI with various mSPI : mCMC ratio
Sample mSPI : mCMC Graft ratio/%
SPC-11 1:1 148.12±0.71
SPC-41 1:0.25 36.12±0.11
SPC-81 1:0.125 19.23±0.32
2. The authors claimed that the initial decomposition temperatures of SPI, CMC, and SPC were
160 ° C, 188 ° C, and 232 ° C, respectively. Please check these conclusions and figure 3b. It seems
that SPC demonstrate a low thermal stability than other two samples. By the way, how the
authors define the initial decomposition temperatures?
Answer: Thanks for reviewer’s question. In fact, the thermal stability of SPC is not weaker than
that of SPI. The mass loss of SPC in the early stage is mainly due to the moisture in the sample.
When CMC is combined with SPI, the hydrophilic groups are significantly increased, and the
water retention capacity of SPC is strong, so the residual moisture of the sample become more
obvious. For the initial decomposition temperature, it is the temperature at which the material
begins to decompose obtained from tangent of TG curve. However, when the decomposition
temperature of the material is around 100 ° C, the initial decomposition temperature is often
difficult to determine due to the influence of moisture in the sample. Therefore, we removed the
analysis of the initial decomposition temperature in the manuscript and re-analyzed the thermal
stability of the material from the main decomposition temperature range.
3. The sustained release of different SPC@AVM composites in Figure 7 seems to show slightly
difference. But the error bars for each data point are suggested to be added in the Figure 7. The
same revisions also should be made in Figure 8.
Answer: Thanks for reviewer’s advice. We have added error bars in the Figure 7a, 7b and Figure 8.
However, Figs 7c-7f were not required error bars due to model fitting data.
4. The author claimed that a single glass transition in the DSC heating curves indicated that SPI
and CMC were highly compatible. These conclusions are questionable. Each curve in Figure 3 (d)
shows a wide and broad peak. Are you sure this is only a single peak? If this is the truth, please
provide the purity of SPC.
Answer: Thanks for reviewer’s question. We re-tested the DSC using different instruments and
found that SPI, CMC, and SPC also showed single glass transitions which were still wide and broad
peaks. According to the literature,[1-3] the glass transition curves of some polymers (such as
proteins and polysaccharides) were a wide and broad peak due to the complex structure of
natural polymers. In addition, we found that the purity of SPC in the test sample was 83.76%
according to formula (2).
Purity <U+F03D> (m1 <U+F02D> m2 ) / m1 (2)
Where, m1 is the total mass of sample, m2 is the mass of SPI not reacting with the CMC,
which can be obtained by the isoelectric point deposition method.

2. The author using the UV absorption to measure AVM content, and the standard curve seems
to be the same in ‘2.5 Encapsulation efficiency’ and ‘2.6 Protection against UV light’. Please
carefully check.
Answer: Thanks for reviewer’s question. We dilute the samples using absolute ethanol in the “2.5
Encapsulation efficiency” and “2.6 Protection against UV light”, so the standard curve was
consistent.

Answer: Thanks for reviewer’s question. We have changed the “CMC is a lo4ng-chain polymer” to
“CMC is a long-chain polymer”.
4. In Fig. 5d-5f, one transverse captions should be used.
Answer: Thanks for reviewer’s advice. We have used transverse captions in Figs. 5d-5f. As shown
in Figs. 5d-5f.

6. In toxicity analysis, the LC50 value of UV/SPC@AVM is higher than that of AVM solution;
however, the reason is not clear. It may be degradation loss by UV irradiation or the slow-release
from composites. The SPC@AVM group should be used to illustrate this point.
Answer: Thanks for reviewer’s advice. We performed the experiment again and supplemented
the virulence analysis of SPC@AVM. The results show in Table 5. It showed that the virulence
difference between SPC@AVM and AVM was not significant. SPC@AVM maintains high
insecticidal activity after illumination due to the encapsulation of AVM by SPC. It has been revised
in the manuscript.
