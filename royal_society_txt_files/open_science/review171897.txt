This manuscript seeks broad patterns in human subsistence on a global scale. this is an ambitious
aim, but a necessary one. As the authors point out, there are numerous theories about the
relationship between environmental variables, sociopolitical organization, cultural transmission,
and subsistence that have never been adequately tested. This situation has led to a proliferation
of claims about general patterns, some of which make opposite predictions that have not been
evaluated empirically. for this reason, this effort is an important one that I think should be
published. It communicates clearly that this situation doesn't move knowledge forward.
The approach to quantification taken here is creative and rigorous in accounting for variables that
previous study of a similar kind have not explored. The authors take history into account
(considering proximity to other societies and language relationships that indicate shared
ancestry), which should quell any claims that generalizing approaches ignore particulars.
I can't really evaluated the statistical methods in detail. I think PCA is a good way to identify and
isolate patterns by creating synthetic variables. This is useful. The multiple models approach is
powerful and has been used successfully in other contexts.
The one element of this analysis that concerns me is the tripartite division of subsistence patterns.
I understand the benefits of simplification here, but I think the classification scheme is so broad
that it obscures way too much variation. For example, looking over the list of ethnic groups, I see
that the Iroquois are categorized as "foragers", whereas all the Puebloan groups of the Southwest
rely on "plant-based agriculture." All these groups can be characterized as relying on maize-
based agriculture accompanied by a significant foraging component. Similarly, Northwest Coast
groups relied heavily on resources that were managed in situ in some way, depended on storage,
and had a high degree of residential stability. They are "foragers" along with highly mobile
groups that do little in the way of habitat management. I worry that this obscuring of variation
also influences the outcomes and conclusions--what does it mean to posit that "in the most stable
environments, the predicted probability of plant-based agriculture as a dominant subsistence
strategy increases to >80%" when that category is so diverse?
Ideally, I think the study would benefit from more coherent subsistence categories. I realize that
a great deal of work has gone into the study, and this does not represent a fatal flaw. However, I
think the authors need to acknowledge and discuss this fact and its influence on the results.

I was excited to see a quantitative, rather than a narrative approach to evaluating human
subsistence. But I think the authors overstate the case that there has been little effort made
towards the subject: Louis Binford, Lawrence Keeley and several others would certainly disagree,
given their expertise in the matter, at least with hunter-gatherers. And though I like the general
approach of the article, I found it lacking in important detail, replicability, and in its conclusions.
The structure of the sample and the way it was analyzed I also found problematic. To me, there
wasn’t enough information in either the methodological descriptions in the text or in the data
tables to be able to fully understand exactly on which data the various analyses and statistical
tests were run. This of course means it would be very difficult to replicate the study. Looking at
their sample (Supplementary Table 5), it looks like there are plenty of extant ethnographic groups
like the !Kung, but also ancient groups like the “Ancient Egyptians” and the Babylonians. The
failure to stratify the analysis by time means that (1) there’s a possibility that two groups could
occupy almost the same environment (and that they may be historically related), (2) that
environmental change isn’t accounted for in the analysis, and (3) that the historical relationships
that the authors are so critical of are not adequately accounted for in the analysis. This leads to
my last major concern: the conclusions. In their effort to argue against historical contingency
(and in their atemporal sampling) they fail to account for the fact that prior to about 11,000 years
ago, every human on the planet was a hunter-gatherer and that this situation persisted in many
places across the globe until quite recently. In other words, the most productive environments
now occupied by farmers (and industrial agriculture) were once occupied by hunter-gatherers
(Mesolithic Europe, for example). Why farming replaced foraging is of course partly an historical
process – e.g., via migration and diffusion. It is also arguably an evolutionary one – e.g., farmers
outproduce, out-reproduce, and ultimately outcompete foragers (as the authors mention in their
introduction). In other words, their analyses are so broad and general that on the one hand they
have to be true (which isn’t all that interesting) and on the other hand that they are going to be
untrue in many specific circumstances. To make this publishable, a little more work is needed to
clarify the methodology and present the data upon which the analyses were run. The question of
time must also be addressed (which ought to change the sampling and analysis methodology)
and the conclusions need to take into account the long term trajectories of forager-farmer and
hunter-herder transitions which, I imagine, ought to refine the deterministic conclusions of this
paper.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
Gavin et al. claim to provide the first global evaluation of multiple hypotheses proposed to
explain human subsistence transitions. This is an important topic, and an interesting paper, but
given several significant issues, I cannot recommend publication.
Critically, the structure of the analysis and the interpretation of the results illustrates that the
authors are neither familiar with the limitations of their data, nor the underlying factors that
structure human subsistence. This is evident in six specific areas.
First, and problematically, the analysis and the interpretation of the results implicitly assume that
all societies in the sample existed at the same time (e.g., see page 7, paragraph that begins on ln
47, and page 12, on Ln 12). This is certainly not the case. That information is available from
databases from which the cases are pulled.
Second, the authors gloss over significant variation within their subsistence categories (e.g.,
hunting vs. gathering vs. aquatic focused hunter-gatherer populations), which leads to analysis
and conclusions that are far too simplistic and course grained to be meaningful. Indeed, some
intensive hunter-gatherers may have more in common with agriculturalists. This needs to be
remedied and the data to do so are available (e.g., Binford 2001, Johnson 2014).
Third, the authors conflate domestication and food production (see Smith 2001), which leads to
erroneous interpretations. Further, because different domesticated plants have very different
growing requirements, they may be predicted by different environmental parameters, which
might explain some of the residual variation.
Fourth, the research design seems backward. Given significant co-variance between predictor
variables, the authors conduct a principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of
variables to a few orthogonal predictors. However, this process then forces the predictor
variables into explanatory categories provided by PCA. As such, the predictor variables selected
(or available) end up driving how the hypotheses are framed, rather than the other way around.
These predictor categories are then paired with a mix of hypotheses “from the literature” that are
not even necessarily mutually exclusive. Unfortunately, inductive testing of non-mutually
exclusive hypotheses pulled from the literature will never lead to explanation. It is an exercise
that has more in common with exploratory data analysis.
Fifth, and related to the above: while the multi-model approach is appreciated, models should
only include variables that are nominated a priori (Burnham and Anderson 2002:419). The
5
authors do not strictly follow this. Advancing hypotheses and predictor variables a priori (e.g.,
from theory, see below) will also help avoid the use of “kitchen sink” models.
The final, and perhaps most important, point relates to the two above: the authors have no
underlying predictions about human behavior that link environmental variation to subsistence
decisions. Because the various factors used to “explain” subsistence are all mediated through
subsistence decisions, the paper lacks causal explanation. There is an extensive literature on this
with several recent reviews (see e.g., Bird and O’Connell 2006, Kennett and Winterhalder 2006).
The lack of theory limits explanation, without explanation, the results are not very satisfying or
useful.
Line by Line Comments:
P 5, Ln 6: While D-Place aggregates existing databases, the exact data used in this paper are not
easily accessible. To facilitate future analysis, the authors should include a complete database
with all of the predictor variables they use in their analysis.
P 5, Ln 46: While the attempt to control for spatial autocorrelation is positive, this approach does
not seem to be a standard solution. Consider including the coordinates of each society within the
model.
P 6, Ln 45: Supplementary Figure 1 suggests some positive residual variation with immediate
neighbors and some residual negative variation at about 4000 KM. Consider investigating further.
P 6, Ln 51: The authors should separate the results from the discussion.
P 7, Ln 22: As stated above, these are not necessarily competing hypotheses.
P 7, Ln 25: This confuses domestication and food production (see Smith 2001).
P 7, Ln 39: This paragraph seems out of place.
P 7, Ln 51: Awkward sentence, please revise.
P 7, Ln 58: There are many different kinds of plan-based agriculture.
P 10, Ln 51: Naive notion of bands/tribes. See Service (1971) and Fried (1967).
P 11, Ln 14: This explanation seems circular.
P 12, Ln 5: Note, neighbors are also more likely to live in similar environments.
Pg 12, Ln 25: Is this the first global empirical test?
Figure 1: Not a color-blind safe palate
Figure 2: While a graphical representation of the hypotheses would be useful, this figure is not
very effective. Also, the results figures should be much larger, and ideally distinct figures.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
I am grateful for the authors careful attention to comments on the previous version of the paper.
Nonetheless, I am still not convinced this paper offers results significant enough for this journal.
Importantly, I still see flaws in the interpretation of the results, which amount to quantitative
description - not explanation - and I am put off by the authors' continued attempts to sell the
paper as something remarkably new - despite several comments from reviewers to the contrary. I
offer two specific comments on these topics below. Despite these comments, the analysis appears
sound and now that the data are made available, the paper offers a valuable service for future
researchers. Thus the paper is publishable following minor changes.
Comments:
First, even after multiple comments by reviewers, the authors still push the idea that they are
12
doing something completely novel, but this approach - a global analysis of subsistence - is not
new. The authors need to tone down language that overemphasizes the importance of this paper.
Second, phrasing in several areas (e.g., "fundamental role in the formation of large-scale societies
and the potential competitive advantage it provides across a range of conditions") still indicates a
complete lack of understanding of how human economic decisions vary in ecological contexts:
foraging is generally more profitable than agriculture (Bowles 2011), and as such, hunting and
gathering should be preferred to farming (see numerous chapters in Kennett and Winterhalder
2006; now cited by the authors). Any "competitive advantage" is merely an unintentional
consequence. Thus it is not a surprise why "agriculture has not been universally adopted", it is an
inferior mode of production from perspective of an individual trying to maximize economic
yields.
This type of confusion appears again in the concluding statement: "Although some researchers
have argued that unique local conditions and events shape subsistence strategies [15,18–20], our
results support assertions[19] that global patterns exist in which environmental conditions,
political complexity, and the strategies used by nearby and closely related groups are all linked to
dominant subsistence strategies." The debate among these researchers is not whether local or
global conditions structure subsistence, but whether subsistence decisions are adaptive responses
to environmental conditions.

Comments to the Author(s)
I am grateful for the authors careful attention to comments on the previous version of the paper.
Nonetheless, I am still not convinced this paper offers results significant enough for this journal.
Importantly, I still see flaws in the interpretation of the results, which amount to quantitative
description - not explanation - and I am put off by the authors' continued attempts to sell the
paper as something remarkably new - despite several comments from reviewers to the contrary. I
offer two specific comments on these topics below. Despite these comments, the analysis appears
sound and now that the data are made available, the paper offers a valuable service for future
researchers. Thus the paper is publishable following minor changes.
Comments:
First, even after multiple comments by reviewers, the authors still push the idea that they are
doing something completely novel, but this approach - a global analysis of subsistence - is not
new. The authors need to tone down language that overemphasizes the importance of this paper.
Second, phrasing in several areas (e.g., "fundamental role in the formation of large-scale societies
and the potential competitive advantage it provides across a range of conditions") still indicates a
complete lack of understanding of how human economic decisions vary in ecological contexts:
foraging is generally more profitable than agriculture (Bowles 2011), and as such, hunting and
gathering should be preferred to farming (see numerous chapters in Kennett and Winterhalder
2006; now cited by the authors). Any "competitive advantage" is merely an unintentional
consequence. Thus it is not a surprise why "agriculture has not been universally adopted", it is an
inferior mode of production from perspective of an individual trying to maximize economic
yields.
This type of confusion appears again in the concluding statement: "Although some researchers
have argued that unique local conditions and events shape subsistence strategies [15,18–20], our
results support assertions[19] that global patterns exist in which environmental conditions,
political complexity, and the strategies used by nearby and closely related groups are all linked to
dominant subsistence strategies." The debate among these researchers is not whether local or
global conditions structure subsistence, but whether subsistence decisions are adaptive responses
to environmental conditions.

Responses to Reviewer Comments
We thank the reviewers for their comments and suggestions. We have addressed each
of these comments below and in the revised manuscript. The major revision has
included adjusting the dataset (to omit ancient societies) and rerunning all analyses.
We have highlighted (using gray highlight) all sections of the manuscript that have
been revised.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript seeks broad patterns in human subsistence on a global scale. this is
an ambitious aim, but a necessary one. As the authors point out, there are numerous
theories about the relationship between environmental variables, sociopolitical
organization, cultural transmission, and subsistence that have never been adequately
tested. This situation has led to a proliferation of claims about general patterns, some
of which make opposite predictions that have not been evaluated empirically. for this
reason, this effort is an important one that I think should be published. It
communicates clearly that this situation doesn't move knowledge forward.
The approach to quantification taken here is creative and rigorous in accounting for
variables that previous study of a similar kind have not explored. The authors take
history into account (considering proximity to other societies and language
relationships that indicate shared ancestry), which should quell any claims that
generalizing approaches ignore particulars.
Response: We thank the reviewer for this assessment of the value of the paper and
our analytical approach
Comments to the Author(s)
I can't really evaluated the statistical methods in detail. I think PCA is a good way to
identify and isolate patterns by creating synthetic variables. This is useful. The
multiple models approach is powerful and has been used successfully in other
contexts.
The one element of this analysis that concerns me is the tripartite division of
subsistence patterns. I understand the benefits of simplification here, but I think the
classification scheme is so broad that it obscures way too much variation. For
example, looking over the list of ethnic groups, I see that the Iroquois are categorized
as "foragers", whereas all the Puebloan groups of the Southwest rely on "plant-based
agriculture." All these groups can be characterized as relying on maize-based
agriculture accompanied by a significant foraging component. Similarly, Northwest
Coast groups relied heavily on resources that were managed in situ in some way,
depended on storage, and had a high degree of residential stability. They are
"foragers" along with highly mobile groups that do little in the way of habitat
management. I worry that this obscuring of variation also influences the outcomes
and conclusions--what does it mean to posit that "in the most stable environments,
the predicted probability of plant-based agriculture as a dominant subsistence
strategy increases to >80%" when that category is so diverse?
Ideally, I think the study would benefit from more coherent subsistence categories. I
realize that a great deal of work has gone into the study, and this does not represent a
fatal flaw. However, I think the authors need to acknowledge and discuss this fact
and its influence on the results.
Response: We agree with the reviewer that subsistence varies widely, and that most
societies use a range of different subsistence strategies. We also agree with the
comment on “the benefits of simplification”. We’ve addressed the concern about how
the coding of subsistence may affect results in several different ways. For one, we
have tried to emphasize throughout the manuscript that our focus is on dominant
subsistence strategy, and not on the full range of subsistence strategies used by each
society. For example, in the introduction we note that “Although most extant human
groups use multiple subsistence strategies, the dominant strategy within a group
varies widely across the planet [17] (Fig. 1, see Methods for calculations).”. In
Methods we clarify how we defined dominant subsistence strategy: “Variables
describing subsistence economy (EA001 to EA005) were used to determine the
dominant subsistence strategy, which we defined as the strategy relied on for more
than 56% of total subsistence.”
We also now note that: “We emphasize that our analysis focuses on identifying
factors shaping dominant subsistence strategy, which is distinct from subsistence
diversity. For example, some societies that are primarily (>56%) plant-based
agriculturalists may still obtain a substantial amounts of food from foraging
activities, whereas other societies may rely almost exclusively on plant-based
agriculture. Variation also exists within the three subsistence categories. For
example, the ecological, social and historical factors that shape the degree to which a
society hunts may be different to those that influence the degree to the group relies on
fishing or gathering of food resources. We suggest that future studies can explore
factors that influence diversity within and among subsistence categories, and how
these factors may differ from those we identify here as shaping dominant subsistence
strategy.”
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
I was excited to see a quantitative, rather than a narrative approach to evaluating
human subsistence. But I think the authors overstate the case that there has been
little effort made towards the subject: Louis Binford, Lawrence Keeley and several
others would certainly disagree, given their expertise in the matter, at least with
hunter-gatherers.
Response: We agree with our reviewer that our study builds on important prior
research. Therefore, we have reworded or removed sentences in the manuscript that
may have overstated the unique nature of our study. We now have clarified that our
unique contribution is
“…the first study to use this multi-model inference approach to evaluate the strength
of evidence in support of a global model of dominant human subsistence strategies”
Comments to the Author(s)
And though I like the general approach of the article, I found it lacking in important
detail, replicability, and in its conclusions. The structure of the sample and the way it
was analyzed I also found problematic. To me, there wasn’t enough information in
either the methodological descriptions in the text or in the data tables to be able to
fully understand exactly on which data the various analyses and statistical tests were
run. This of course means it would be very difficult to replicate the study.
Response: We’ve added a table to supplementary material that includes all the data
used.
Comments to the Author(s)
Looking at their sample (Supplementary Table 5), it looks like there are plenty of
extant ethnographic groups like the !Kung, but also ancient groups like the “Ancient
Egyptians” and the Babylonians. The failure to stratify the analysis by time means
that (1) there’s a possibility that two groups could occupy almost the same
environment (and that they may be historically related), (2) that environmental
change isn’t accounted for in the analysis, and (3) that the historical relationships that
the authors are so critical of are not adequately accounted for in the analysis.
Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing out the issue with the time foci of the
data. We overlooked the inclusion of several ancient societies in the dataset in our
original analysis. These ancient societies have now been removed. The remaining
societies all have time foci between 1860-1960, a span of just four generations. We
have clarified this in the Methods and also emphasized the importance of time foci as
noted by the reviewer. These changes in the dataset have led us to rerun all analyses.
Although some of the details of the results have changed with the new analysis, the
central conclusions remain the same.
Comments to the Author(s)
This leads to my last major concern: the conclusions. In their effort to argue against
historical contingency (and in their atemporal sampling) they fail to account for the
fact that prior to about 11,000 years ago, every human on the planet was a hunter-
gatherer and that this situation persisted in many places across the globe until quite
recently. In other words, the most productive environments now occupied by farmers
(and industrial agriculture) were once occupied by hunter-gatherers (Mesolithic
Europe, for example). Why farming replaced foraging is of course partly an historical
process – e.g., via migration and diffusion. It is also arguably an evolutionary one –
e.g., farmers outproduce, out-reproduce, and ultimately outcompete foragers (as the
authors mention in their introduction). In other words, their analyses are so broad
and general that on the one hand they have to be true (which isn’t all that interesting)
and on the other hand that they are going to be untrue in many specific
circumstances. To make this publishable, a little more work is needed to clarify the
methodology and present the data upon which the analyses were run. The question of
time must also be addressed (which ought to change the sampling and analysis
methodology) and the conclusions need to take into account the long term trajectories
of forager-farmer and hunter-herder transitions which, I imagine, ought to refine the
deterministic conclusions of this paper.
Response: As the reviewer suggests, we have now provided all the data used for the
analyses in a supplementary dataset. We have also addressed the question of time. As
noted above, we have adjusted the sample to omit the ancient societies, which limits
concerns regarding the time foci of the data used.
We agree with the reviewer that transitions (and replacements) across history will
have been major contributors to the geographic patterns in the subsistence strategies
we see in more recent societies. Now in the introduction, methods and conclusion
sections, we note the importance of these transitions in shaping human subsistence.
For example, we now note:
“For most of human history, our species exclusively foraged for food via hunting,
gathering and/or fishing [15]. The subsequent spread of food production as a primary
mode of subsistence has been referred to as “the most important process in Holocene
human history” [11]. However, subsistence focused on plant-based agriculture has
not been universally adopted, despite its fundamental role in the formation of large-
scale societies and the potential competitive advantage it provides across a range of
conditions [11,12]. Even recently, hundreds of societies have maintained foraging as
their primary mode of subsistence [16].”
“Before eleven thousand years ago all human societies foraged for food, but more
recently plant-based agriculture or animal husbandry became the dominant
subsistence strategy for most human groups. By applying a multi-model inference
approach that is now widely used in biogeography, we have been able to provide
quantitative estimates of the degree to which different environmental, social, and
historical conditions have shaped the dominant subsistence strategies used in recent
times.”
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
Gavin et al. claim to provide the first global evaluation of multiple hypotheses
proposed to explain human subsistence transitions. This is an important topic, and an
interesting paper, but given several significant issues, I cannot recommend
publication.
Critically, the structure of the analysis and the interpretation of the results illustrates
that the authors are neither familiar with the limitations of their data, nor the
underlying factors that structure human subsistence. This is evident in six specific
areas.
First, and problematically, the analysis and the interpretation of the results implicitly
assume that all societies in the sample existed at the same time (e.g., see page 7,
paragraph that begins on ln 47, and page 12, on Ln 12). This is certainly not the case.
That information is available from databases from which the cases are pulled.
Response: As noted in our response to reviewer 2, we have now removed the ancient
societies from our sample. The sample now includes societies present across a narrow
band of history (1860-1960).
Comments to the Author(s)
Second, the authors gloss over significant variation within their subsistence
categories (e.g., hunting vs. gathering vs. aquatic focused hunter-gatherer
populations), which leads to analysis and conclusions that are far too simplistic and
course grained to be meaningful. Indeed, some intensive hunter-gatherers may have
more in common with agriculturalists. This needs to be remedied and the data to do
so are available (e.g., Binford 2001, Johnson 2014).
Response: As we noted in our response to other reviewers, we agree that there is
substantial variation in subsistence strategies. The goal of our analysis was not to
examine all the nuances of this variation, but rather to identify global-scale patterns
in the subsistence strategies that are dominant in different societies. We have added
details to the manuscript to clarify this focus, and also to note the need for future
studies to evaluate the potential effects of variation within the categories studied
(e.g., foragers that are more hunters vs. fishers). For example, in Methods we now
note: “We emphasize that our analysis focuses on identifying factors shaping
dominant subsistence strategy, which is distinct from subsistence diversity. For
example, some societies that are primarily (>56%) plant-based agriculturalists may
still obtain a substantial amounts of food from foraging activities, whereas other
societies may rely almost exclusively on plant-based agriculture. Variation also exists
within the three subsistence categories. For example, the ecological, social and
historical factors that shape the degree to which a society hunts may be different to
those that influence the degree to which the group relies on fishing or gathering of
food resources. We suggest that future studies can explore factors that influence
diversity within and among subsistence categories, and how these factors may differ
from those we identify here as shaping dominant subsistence strategy.”
Comments to the Author(s)
Third, the authors conflate domestication and food production (see Smith 2001),
which leads to erroneous interpretations. Further, because different domesticated
plants have very different growing requirements, they may be predicted by different
environmental parameters, which might explain some of the residual variation.
Response: We have made several edits and additions to the text to clarify the focus
on food production. We also thank the reviewer for the suggestion, and have now
noted the point that different domesticated plants (and animals) will have different
environmental requirements, which might explain some of the residuals from the
analysis.
Comments to the Author(s)
Fourth, the research design seems backward. Given significant co-variance between
predictor variables, the authors conduct a principal components analysis (PCA) to
reduce the number of variables to a few orthogonal predictors. However, this process
then forces the predictor variables into explanatory categories provided by PCA. As
such, the predictor variables selected (or available) end up driving how the
hypotheses are framed, rather than the other way around. These predictor categories
are then paired with a mix of hypotheses “from the literature” that are not even
necessarily mutually exclusive. Unfortunately, inductive testing of non-mutually
exclusive hypotheses pulled from the literature will never lead to explanation. It is an
exercise that has more in common with exploratory data analysis.
Fifth, and related to the above: while the multi-model approach is appreciated,
models should only include variables that are nominated a priori (Burnham and
Anderson 2002:419). The authors do not strictly follow this. Advancing hypotheses
and predictor variables a priori (e.g., from theory, see below) will also help avoid the
use of “kitchen sink” models.
Response: The hypotheses tested were established a priori based on the literature
(please see clarification below in response to another reviewer comment on the
question of mutual exclusivity). The question is how to test the hypotheses. In other
words, what variables can be used to measure a proposed concept (e.g.,
environmental productivity)? We have chosen to use factors from a PCA as the
measures of the proposed concepts (e.g., environmental productivity and stability)
that are core to the hypotheses. The approach we take with the use of PCA to reduce
environmental variables into a series of factors is a common procedure used in a wide
range of different studies in the field of biogeography (and was commended by
another reviewer). This approach is necessary to avoid multicollinearity. The factors
produced by the PCA are how we measure the variables that were hypothesized to
have an effect on subsistence strategies.
In addition, this is not a kitchen sink approach as it tests a priori hypotheses
individually and in combination. It is theoretically possible that just one hypothesis
would be selected through this process. This would occur if the lowest AIC values
were from a model with just one factor in it. However, as we note in the results:
“none of the putative environmental, social and historical predictors suggested to date
is individually capable of predicting the entire range of global variation we observe in
dominant subsistence strategies across the globe (<U+F044>AICc > 205 for models with only
individual factors)”
The approach we have used (using PCA and multi-model inference) is a common
procedure in biogeography and has been used previously for studies of the
geographic patterns of human cultural features (e.g., religion, (Botero et al., 2014)

(2014). The ecology of religious beliefs. Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, 111(47), 16784–16789.
Comments to the Author(s)
The final, and perhaps most important, point relates to the two above: the authors
have no underlying predictions about human behavior that link environmental
variation to subsistence decisions. Because the various factors used to “explain”
subsistence are all mediated through subsistence decisions, the paper lacks causal
explanation. There is an extensive literature on this with several recent reviews (see
e.g., Bird and O’Connell 2006, Kennett and Winterhalder 2006). The lack of theory
limits explanation, without explanation, the results are not very satisfying or useful.
Response: We agree with the reviewer that subsistence decisions ultimately lead to
subsistence actions. To clarify this point we have added to our discussion to note that
the correlations used in our study do not imply direct causation and that ultimately
subsistence is linked to human agency and individual human decisions. What the
results imply is a role for various environmental, social, and historical factors in
shaping subsistence decisions.

P 5, Ln 6: While D-Place aggregates existing databases, the exact data used in this
paper are not easily accessible. To facilitate future analysis, the authors should
include a complete database with all of the predictor variables they use in their
analysis.
Response: We’ve added the complete dataset as a supplement
Comments to the Author(s)
P 5, Ln 46: While the attempt to control for spatial autocorrelation is positive, this
approach does not seem to be a standard solution. Consider including the coordinates
of each society within the model.
Response: Our approach to test residuals for the presence of spatial autocorrelation is
commonly used within the field of biogeography (e.g., Diniz-Filho & Bini, 2005;

P 6, Ln 45: Supplementary Figure 1 suggests some positive residual variation with
immediate neighbors and some residual negative variation at about 4000 KM.
Consider investigating further.
Response: The Moran’s I is close to zero across the entire range tested. Prior research
suggests that a Moran’s I larger than 0.1 may be cause for further investigation (e.g.,
Diniz-Filho & Bini, 2005). The absolute value for Moran’s I in our analysis of
residuals is well below 0.1 at all distances.

Comments to the Author(s)
P 6, Ln 51: The authors should separate the results from the discussion.
Response: The journal’s author guidelines note: “please feel free to use whatever
headings and subheadings best suit your article.” We feel that the flow of the ideas
throughout the article is better when we combine results and discussion. This allows
us to discuss evidence for or against the relevant hypotheses in turn, and using this
format we avoid unnecessary repetition from having the results and discussion
separated.
Comments to the Author(s)
P 7, Ln 22: As stated above, these are not necessarily competing hypotheses.
Response: We agree that the first and third hypotheses noted here may be linked in
that they both discuss agriculture existing where environmental productivity is
higher. To clarify we have reworded the sentence to remove the words “competing”
and “different”
Comments to the Author(s)
P 7, Ln 25: This confuses domestication and food production (see Smith 2001).
Response: We have reworded here and in other locations in the paper to avoid
confusion between domestication and food production.

P 7, Ln 39: This paragraph seems out of place.
Response: We’ve moved the paragraph and incorporated into our discussion of the
results from our model.
Comments to the Author(s)
P 7, Ln 51: Awkward sentence, please revise.
Response: We’ve reworded the sentence.
Comments to the Author(s)
P 7, Ln 58: There are many different kinds of plan-based agriculture.
Response: We agree that many different kinds of plant-based agriculture exist. To
clarify that we are not refer to all plant-based agriculturalists, we now refer to “even
after the expansion of the ranges of some plant-based agriculturalists”
Comments to the Author(s)
P 10, Ln 51: Naive notion of bands/tribes. See Service (1971) and Fried (1967).
Response: The sentence in question is not in the revised version of the manuscript.
Comments to the Author(s)
P 11, Ln 14: This explanation seems circular.
Response: Page 11 line 14 notes: “Although exceptional cases clearly exist, our
comparative analysis finds evidence for a global pattern in which political complexity
is linked to subsistence strategy (Tables 3 and 4, Figs 2d and 2e).” Our point here is
that on a global scale we find a strong relationship between levels of political
complexity and dominant subsistence strategy. We then provide evidence for this
linkage: “For example, societies with higher levels of political complexity, in the
form of chiefdoms and states, are >50% more likely to use a plant-based agriculture
as their dominant subsistence strategy.”
Comments to the Author(s)
P 12, Ln 5: Note, neighbors are also more likely to live in similar environments.
Response: We’ve now added the reviewer’s suggestion to the sentence:
“Neighboring societies may exhibit similar subsistence strategies due to the
horizontal transmission of ideas and technologies and due to experiencing similar
environments.”
Comments to the Author(s)
Pg 12, Ln 25: Is this the first global empirical test?
Response: To avoid any confusion, we have removed the sentence in question.
Comments to the Author(s)
Figure 1: Not a color-blind safe palate
Response: We did use a color-blind safe palette to produce the figure. We have now
referenced it in the acknowledgements
(https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/colourschemes.pdf).
Comments to the Author(s)
Figure 2: While a graphical representation of the hypotheses would be useful, this
figure is not very effective. Also, the results figures should be much larger, and
ideally distinct figures.
Response: As the reviewer suggests, we have increased the size of the results figures
to make them more readable.
Appendix B
Responses to Reviewer Comments
We address each of the reviewer’s comments below.
Reviewer comment:
First, even after multiple comments by reviewers, the authors still push the idea that
they are doing something completely novel, but this approach - a global analysis of
subsistence - is not new. The authors need to tone down language that
overemphasizes the importance of this paper.
Response:
We agree with the reviewer that important prior work has been done on subsistence
at a global scale, and we cite a wide range of this prior work. The reviewer does not
indicate any specific studies we have not cited and discussed. We also believe that
our use of a multi-model inference approach adapted from biogeography to examine
global patterns of subsistence is unique, and in the paper we have provided a detailed
explanation of the method and compared it to prior approaches (e.g., see the last
paragraph in the introduction section). Our methodological approach allows us to test
multiple competing hypotheses. However, to ensure that we have not oversold our
contribution compared to prior work, we have sought to further tone down the
language used at several points in the manuscript.
Reviewer comment:
Second, phrasing in several areas (e.g., "fundamental role in the formation of large-
scale societies and the potential competitive advantage it provides across a range of
conditions") still indicates a complete lack of understanding of how human economic
decisions vary in ecological contexts: foraging is generally more profitable than
agriculture (Bowles 2011), and as such, hunting and gathering should be preferred to
farming (see numerous chapters in Kennett and Winterhalder 2006; now cited by the
authors). Any "competitive advantage" is merely an unintentional consequence. Thus
it is not a surprise why "agriculture has not been universally adopted", it is an inferior
mode of production from perspective of an individual trying to maximize economic
yields.
Response: We agree that in most locations early forms of agriculture would not have
provided a competitive advantage. However, unlike Bowles (2011), we are not
studying first farmers, but more recent forms of agriculture. The relative “economic
yields” of agriculture have clearly changed over time, as social-ecological conditions
have evolved. Our wording (including “potential competitive advantage” and “range
of conditions”) does not reflect “a complete lack of understanding”, but rather an
appreciation of the diverse social and ecological conditions that shape subsistence
decisions over time. However, given that the phrase in question is not critical to our
point that “subsistence focused on plant-based agriculture has not been universally
adopted”, we have chosen to remove the phrase from the sentence.
Reviewer comment:
This type of confusion appears again in the concluding statement: "Although some
researchers have argued that unique local conditions and events shape subsistence
strategies [15,18–20], our results support assertions [19] that global patterns exist in
which environmental conditions, political complexity, and the strategies used by
nearby and closely related groups are all linked to dominant subsistence strategies."
The debate among these researchers is not whether local or global conditions
structure subsistence, but whether subsistence decisions are adaptive responses to
environmental conditions.
Response:
We disagree with the reviewer’s depiction of these prior studies. The work we cite
does focus on whether subsistence decisions have been based on local, historically
contingent factors vs. more global or universal factors. In addition, the work we cite
does not focus solely on adaptive responses to the environment, but also includes
consideration of social factors. For example, Larson et al. (our ref 15) when
discussing why foragers turn to cultivation and herding note that: “Although some
consider the primary driving factors to be patterns of climatic and ecological change,
others argue for the primacy of social imperatives and changes within social systems
(23, 24, 111). More generally, some scholars have claimed that no explanations are
likely to be universally applicable (112), whereas others have adopted an explicitly
comparative approach, identifying parallel processes and exploring common
underlying patterns (7, 15, 25).” (Note: Larson et al’s ref 15 is our ref 18, and Larson
et al’s ref 25 is our ref 19). Note that Larson et al do not refer only to adaptive
responses to environmental conditions. They also discuss social imperatives and
changes to social systems; and they emphasize the debate regarding universal
explanations. As another example, Gremillon et al (our ref 19) notes: “one result of
this changing climate has been a proliferation of historical narratives that highlight
local events and processes and downplay general principles”. Given this careful
reading of the literature, we have kept our original sentence and stand by our
arguments that debates exist regarding local vs. global factors shaping subsistence.
