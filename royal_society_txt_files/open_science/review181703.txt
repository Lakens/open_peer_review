The Authors tackled an interesting problem of spatio-temporal evolution of coral reefs in
mesoscopic scale (20*20 m), diving the 2D system to small, 0.1*0.1 m cells, using cyclic boundary
conditions. The calculations are correct, conclusions are well-established (it is a transferred
manuscript, already revised, at least once). I have only one problem with the results presented in
the manuscript:
- although meso-scales are very important, to have good description for the spatial characteristic
of a coral reef, it would be very much advised to go above 20*20 meters. It would be interesting to
see the validity of the conclusions on spatial scales covering the whole reef. In the present form,
the manuscripts present interesting results, but might not be good enough for a leading scientific
journal.

This manuscript is a slightly modified version of the one submitted before to Royal Society

based on additional suggestions the reviewers did. Overall these modifications helped improving
the manuscript and therefore I think the publications of the work should not be delayed too

the pace of the transient towards the stable climax state. This kind of insights could for example

The authors and I have a fundamentally different view on what can be generalised based on the

result in context of other spatially structures ecosystems. I do agree that making generalisations
should be done with care and caution. Yet, using such a generic tool as an CA… The probabilistic
dynamics in such a model are very generic and analogous to many other systems (see for instance
Pascual & Guichard 2005 TREE or Kefi et al 2011 in Ecology Letters). Hence, I would at least
speculate a bit on the possible larger applicability of your results to other spatially extended
systems because in many modelling studies 'typically random initial configurations' (e.g. in L429-
435) are used.
But as said, I don’t think this difference in insight should preclude a further delay of this
interesting modelling study.

Comments to the Author
Referee’s report
Revised version; Influence of Aggregation on Benthic Coral Reef Spatio-temporal
Dynamics by Marlene Brito-Millan, BT Werner, Stuart A Sandin, Dylan E McNamara
The Authors clarified most off the questions raised by the other referees and in some
sense, the manuscript is improved. But I still do believe, that it is not sufficient for
publication in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. The Author reasoned, that the
system size used by them is generally accepted within the community; it might be true,
but my remark is still valid, that much better resolutions would be required to provide
new results. Present supercomputers – and even high-speed PC-s – are able to reach
much bigger resolution, than this 200*200, 2m^2 one.
We feel an important clarification must be made here. The reef area we are
simulating IS NOT 2 m^2. It is a 400 m^2 (20m x 20m) reef area, a spatial scale
large enough to capture cross-reef structural and compositional patterns. This is
now explicitly stated from Line 150.
Additionally, using parameters established previously by other low-resolution simulation
is not necessarily the way to reach novel results.
From a complex systems perspective, it is widely theorized that small-scale
interactions at a constituent level (in our case the scale of the coral colony animal)
can lead to emergent patterns at larger landscape levels through processes of
self-organization (e.g., Liu et al 2014; Rietkerk & van de Koppel 2008, Kessler &
Werner 2003). Model behavior and dynamics have been shown to be robust to the
parameters used in our study (as stated in L180).
I still believe that the problem is interesting, the methodology is good, but the calculation
and the numerical results are insufficient, therefore I do not recommend the publication.

Comments to the Author
Overall many things have been improved. I think the study and its results are of interest
to the readers of Interface, although I still think that the study is still too much focused on
coral reef community and the readers of this journal are interested in a broader scope I
imagine.
We thank the reviewer for their comment. We have added additional text referring
to non-coral systems to further widen the scope. L90 cites work on marsh
tussocks; L355 links to papers referring to pattern formation in non-coral
ecosystems. Importantly, though, we believe that further analogies and
applicability to other ecosystems will depend upon having thorough
understanding of the dynamics of the systems in question. We have aimed to be
transparent regarding the core dynamics and interactions within our system. We
have guesses of analogous systems, but believe that assertions regarding direct
analogs is dangerous in terms of scholarship, and believe that it is beyond the
scope of this manuscript to assert deep dynamical knowledge of other systems.
The authors solved one of my main concerns by building up better to the final figure
(previously Fig6 and now Fig7). They do this e.g. by providing a set of questions (lines
135-144) they investigate before drawing the final conclusions. I like this very much as it
provides much more structure to the whole manuscript. This lack of structure in the
previous version might have led to me thinking they were hiding the most interesting
results in the back of the manuscript. Furthermore, I very much like the additional Figure
1. This makes the possible transitions in the model much more clear.
However, I think it would be good if Fig2 is a bit expanded by showing another transient
as well. Now the sequence of spatial arrangements from initial (0) to final (at 250) is
shown. But One of the main points of the author is that differences in transient are due to
differences in initial spatial configurations. It would be nice if you could see at least two
of these differences transients including a sequence of spatial configurations to illustrate
this point here.
We have added the additional pathway into figure 2 with its corresponding
sequence of spatial configurations. Fig 2 text has been updated to describe
changes (L619).
Moreover, I still have some difficulty following the rational behind the demarkations of the
transients. The authors claim they have good knowledge of the start and end points and
not about the transients. But to me it doesn't become clear how they use this knowledge
and how this is applied in the choices for demarcating the different development stages.
For instance on what ground do they use a fit to the exponential to part of the transient?
I think it could help explaining the rational behind these choices better.
To address the reviewer’s confusion about why exponential fits formed the basis
of our determination of the transitions between repelling and transient and
transient and attracting stages, we added the following sentence to the
manuscript starting on L245: “Specifically, the linearized solutions to escape from and
decay to the repellor/attractor in the repelling/attracting stages are exponential
rise/decay (Ott, 1983).”
Additional remarks:
Line 139. Switch order of the nonlinear and linear
Change made (now L139).
Line 154. Why are cylindrical and not cyclic boundary conditions used?
We use periodic boundary conditions in both horizontal directions, in other
words, a toroidal lattice, to simulate a domain that is large enough for reefscape
patterns to emerge. (now stated in L150)

Thanks.
We thank the editor for their interest in our study. Further, we appreciate the enthusiasm and
curiosity that our study appears to have invoked. Modeling studies are constructed with model
structures and assumptions that address particular suites of questions. As the Editor identifies, we
chose the structure of this model (linked with the definition of the domain) with the goal of
answering questions about how clumping at the colony / patch scale (order 10-100m^2 clumps)
influence the rate of dynamical evolution. If we had been interested in rates of dynamical evolution
for coastlines to islands (order 1000-10000m^2 features), a different model structure would have
been introduced. Of course, the answers that could emerge from such a study hold immense
promise, and we appreciate the enthusiasm of the Associate Editor in highlighting this potential.
In the manuscript, we have sought to include more justification of our goals and approach, which
hopefully will provide more context for the reader.
The manuscript has been left-justified.

Comments to the Author(s)
The Authors tackled an interesting problem of spatio-temporal evolution of coral reefs in mesoscopic scale
(20*20 m), diving the 2D system to small, 0.1*0.1 m cells, using cyclic boundary conditions. The
calculations are correct, conclusions are well-established (it is a transferred manuscript, already revised, at
least once). I have only one problem with the results presented in the manuscript:
- although meso-scales are very important, to have good description for the spatial characteristic of a
coral reef, it would be very much advised to go above 20*20 meters. It would be interesting to see the
validity of the conclusions on spatial scales covering the whole reef. In the present form, the manuscripts
present interesting results, but might not be good enough for a leading scientific journal.
We thank the reviewer for their insight. The intermediate spatial scale simulated (on the order of
tens of meters) is large enough to capture emergent spatio-temporal patterns based on constituent-
scale dynamics (thousands of coral colonies), which was the primary aim of this work. Additionally,
this scale is in line with current studies based on reef photomosaic data being collected across the
tropics for analyses of spatial patterns and structural complexity (e.g., 10 m x 10 m plots in
Edwards et. al. 2017, 15 m x 15 m plots in Gonzalez-Rivero et. al. 2017, etc.) as well as the spatial
scale of many active coral outplanting and restoration efforts.
We recognize the need within the field of coral reef conservation to move towards simulating larger
reef areas grounded in the dynamics of the reefscape. This need partially motivated current work
that upscaled this paper’s lattice model into a PDE model that simulates larger areas (on order of
hundreds of meters) based on constituent (coral colony) benthic dynamics (manuscript on this
topic in preparation). Importantly, the focal results from this study (i.e., that clumped patterns
demonstrate slower dynamics than random patterns) are revealed similarly from our generalized
methodology, although with less resolution of the dynamical structure. As such, and despite
analytical approaches to search for bias of results, we have found no evidence that the conclusions
presented in this manuscript are sensitive to the spatial scale of analysis (specifically, not when
considering the effects of colony / patch scale clumping on emergent dynamics).
Finally, the ultimate challenge for conducting very-large-scale simulations will remain
identifying comparisons of model results to large-scale time-series data of community
structure, as such large-scale data has only recently begun to be collected, digitized and
analyzed using archival photographic techniques (with ecological post-processing being
the most time-intensive step).
We have included more about the chosen scale based on the above points in the main text
from L151:
“The model domain consists of a 200 x 200 cell lattice simulating a 400 m2 area with
periodic boundary conditions in both horizontal directions (i.e., a toroidal lattice); large
enough to capture cross-reef spatial patterns based on constituent-scale dynamics (for
thousands of coral colonies). Additionally, this scale is in line with current studies based
on larger-area benthic assessments using reef photomosaic data that are being collected
across the tropics for analyses of spatial patterns and structural complexity (e.g., 10 m x 10
m plots in (27) and 15 m x 15 m plots in (31)) as well as the spatial scale of many active
coral outplanting and restoration efforts.”

al 2011 in Ecology Letters). Hence, I would at least speculate a bit on the possible larger applicability of
your results to other spatially extended systems because in many modelling studies 'typically random initial
configurations' (e.g. in L429-435) are used.
But as said, I don’t think this difference in insight should preclude a further delay of this interesting
modelling study.
We thank the reviewer for their insight. We have added the following sentence to
emphasize the need to consider the effect of non-random initial configurations in other
spatially extended systems, although such considerations are beyond the scope of this
study (from L447):
“Generally, the resulting delay effect arising from more clumped initial configurations on
dynamical pathways suggests that analyses of models of other spatially extended systems
might benefit from considering the effect of initial spatial configurations that deviate from
random distributions on modeled system dynamics”.
