In this manuscript, Paira and co-workers have reported water mediated green synthesis of Biotin
and GSH modified PbS QDs under sonication. Labeling and bio imaging of the cells with these
bio-conjugated quantum dots was evaluated, which can open its plausibility for applications in
biological systems. I recommend this manuscript be accepted for publication in RSOS after minor
corrections as noted below.
1) There are quite a few works done by other groups, especially those examples pubulished in
2017, which should be properly cited in introduction.
2) Some pictures or tables are not very clear in figures 1-4.
3) In Figure S4, the fluorescence intensity of GSH modified PbS is increasing with the
extension of storage time. Please comment the reason, which is very informative for readers. And
what is the result for Biotin-SA-PbS?
4) In the introduction, it should be “ß-lactoglobulin”, not “b-lactoglobulin”.

In this manuscript, the authors generated biotin and glutathione modified lead sulfide quantum
dot (QD) under sonication condition. The authors characterized the QD and tested them in
cellular context. The whole research seems carried out systematically. However, the expression of
this manuscript is not in a scientifically rigorous way, as demonstrated in the following obvious
mistakes which could be avoided easily. Therefore, I have to doubt the trustworthiness of the
data generated by the authors. A major overhaul is needed before considering to be published in
Royal Society Open Science.

Dear Dr Paira,
Title: Water mediated green synthesis of PbS Quantum Dot and its GSH and biotin conjugates for
non-invasive live cell imaging†
Manuscript ID: RSOS-171614
Thank you for submitting the above manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. On behalf of the
Editors and the Royal Society of Chemistry, I am pleased to inform you that your manuscript will
be accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance
with the referee suggestions. Please find the reviewers' comments at the end of this email.
The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript.
Please also include the following statements alongside the other end statements. As we cannot
publish your manuscript without these end statements included, if you feel that a given heading
is not relevant to your paper, please nevertheless include the heading and explicitly state that it is
not relevant to your work. We have included a screenshot example of the end statements for
reference.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days (i.e. by the 24-Dec-2017). If you do not think
you will be able to meet this date please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
4
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Best wishes,
James Moore

Q. There are quite a few works done by other groups, especially those examples published in 2017, which
should be properly cited in introduction.
Ans. Correction has been done in the revised manuscript. Ref and in added part in introduction has been
highlighted in yellow colour.
Q. 2) Some pictures or tables are not very clear in figures 1-4.
Ans. Correction has been done in the revised manuscript.
Q. In Figure S4, the fluorescence intensity of GSH modified PbS is increasing with the
extension of storage time. Please comment the reason, which is very informative for readers. And what is
the result for Biotin-SA-PbS?
Ans. This is due to surface capping and passivation. Already reference has been added for it. Same result
was observed in case of Biotin-SA-PbS
Q. In the introduction, it should be “ß-lactoglobulin”, not “b-lactoglobulin”.
Ans. Correction has been done in the revised manuscript.

Q. Page 3 Line 37, it should be “Figure 5a”
Ans. Correction has been done in the revised manuscript.
Q. Page 3 Line 34 right column, the expression of log IC50 does not match the unit µg/ml
Ans. Correction has been done in revised manuscript. Log IC50 has no unit. Unit of IC50 expressed as µg/ml.
Log IC50 and corresponding IC50 of both the QD samples in HeLa and HEK 293 was observed in the range of
2.12-2.35 and 132-224 µg/ml respectively.
Q. Page 4 Line 41 right column, it should be “were” not “was”; The same problems exist for many other
places
Ans. Correction has been done in the revised manuscript.
Q. Fig 4 (d) overlaps with right column.
Ans. Correction has been done in the revised manuscript.
