The paper provides a very detailed anatomical description of a braincase referred to a new genus
and species of dapediid, together with a phylogenetic analysis of basal actinopterygians. Thanks
to the good preservation of the specimen and to the detailed data furnished by the CT scan, the
authors provided an excellent description of the neurocranial anatomy. This part of the work will
serve as a reference for future descriptive and phylogenetic studies dealing with Mesozoic
neopterygians.
Comments on the descriptive part:
Page 9, line 7, “infraorbital canal”: I suggest rather ‘otic branch of the infraorbital canal’ or more
3
simply ’otic sensory canal’ to be more specific (which is the commonest name for this portion of
the canal in neopterygians).
Fig. 6e: Please replace ‘pbc’ by ‘bhc’
The title of reference 54 in the reference list is incomplete
I’m surprised that the authors do not mention the study of Rayner (1948), who provided a pretty
detailed description of a braincase of Dapedius with the material and technics available at that
time. This study was completed and discussed then by Patterson (1975). These pioneer works are
essential steps that led to the present study.
Phylogenetic analysis :
The phylogenetic analysis is not as convincing as the anatomical description. The authors found
the dapediids monophyletic resolved as the sister to the Holostei. There are several issues that
deserve comments in this part of the work.
In figure 10, the authors include the Dapediidae within the holosteans (blue square); so why they
did not list the “Holostei” and the “Dapediidae” in the systematic palaeontology section (p. 6)
(but only Osteichthyes and Actinopterygii)?
Page 6, line 5, “six characters were ordered”: which ones? Why they were ordered? We know that
this kind of decision may have a strong impact in the calculation of the most parsimonious tree,
so it is important to explain here why the authors made this choice.
Page 20, line 25. No information about how the agreement subtree was built is provided in the
method section. Please add a reference for this. I didn’t see the caption of the Supplementary Fig.
1a (Agreement subtree) with the meaning of the coloured symbols along the branches.
The authors did not include pycnodontiforms in their analysis, although this clade is regarded by
several researchers as a potential sister group to dapediids. They explain this choice by the fact
that no 3D neurocranial remains of pycnodonts are available for being included in the
phylogenetic analysis. From my point of view, this reason is certainly not sufficient to exclude
pycnodonts from the analysis because there are likely other terminal taxa in this analysis, which
equally do not show braincase characters. Scopulipiscis, on the other hand, shows braincase
characters, but braincase characters only. This situation didn’t prevent the authors to include it in
the analysis.
A surprising result of the phylogenetic analysis, not mentioned by the authors, is that Amia,
Caturus and Watsonulus are not resolved as a monophyletic group (halecomorphs). I suppose
that one reason that can explain this situation is that the list of characters used in this analysis is
taken from previous studies that were mostly built to decipher the relationships among non-
neopterygians. There is no information about this issue in the main text and everything should be
found in the SI. It would be interesting to have some more information about the origin of this
raw data (characters definitions) in the main text.
Supplementary Information with the list of characters:
First: The list of characters is a bit obscure and difficult to be assessed by the readers, especially in
a .txt format. However, the choice of the characters and the way to code them is fundamental for
the phylogenetic presented in the main text, and some more attention should be given to the
presentation. In particular:
4
- Please provide the references list at the end of the file.
- Please give the meaning of the abbreviations (“G”, “CH”, etc.)
- When opened as a World file, the SI is full of typos errors. This reflects a lack of attention for this
file, although it contains the core information for building the phylogeny.
As mentioned above, most of the characters used here have been defined to understand
relationships of osteichthyians as a whole (Schultze, Cloutier, Ahlberg, Long) and non-
neopterygian actinopts (papers by Gardiner, Zhu, Friedman, Brazeau, Giles, Xu, Choo, Zhao,
Taverne, Poplin, Arratia, ). Only a few characters (24) were originally defined to study
ginglymodian relationships (Grande, Lopez-Arbarello, Cavin) and, as far as I can judge, only
three characters specifically defined for addressing halecomorphs relationships (Grande &
Bemis). I hypothesize that the lack of characters specifically defined for addressing holostean
relationships together with the over-representation of characters specifically defined for
addressing non-neopterygian relationships taken from previous studies, affect the
intrarelationships found among the holosteans, in particular the non-monophyly of
halecomorphs and, possibly, the position of the dapediids.
Eventually, the authors should quote and discuss the recent paper bublished by Lopez-Arbarello
& Sferco 2018: Neopterygian phylogeny: the merger assay. R. Soc. open sci. 5: 172337.
http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.172337. (it is possible that this paper was not yet out when the
ms was submitted). It is worth noting that this research also resolves the dapediids as stem-
holosteans on the basis of a very different datamatrix.
It is probably not necessary to rebuilt here a new phylogenetic analysis based on a new set of
characters, but I suggest that the authors address the points raised above in the main text in the
discussion of their phylogeny.
I added some comments in the pdf file (See Appendix A).

I had the opportunity to read the first version of this article, and I note that all my suggestions
have been addressed in this revised version. In particular, the authors included in the
phylogenetic analysis the pycnodonts. This certainly required a substantial work, but I think that
the results are now more relevant because pycnodonts have often been associated to dapediids.
Incidentally, the inclusion of pycnodonts lowers the resolution among dapediids and at the base
of the tree and, surprisingly, a new clade is formed including bichir and sturgeon (not present in
the first analysis). I don’t mean that it is the place here to discuss further these results, which do
not concerned the topic of this paper, but it shows that the topology obtained for these non-
neopterygians is still rather weak (as it is also the case for some parts of the neopterygian tree).
Anyway, the cladogram of the Actinopterygii will certainly be altered with future works, but the
anatomical description, which forms the core of this study, and which is excellent, will last for
decades.
I consider that the paper can be published in its present form.

Appendix A
Dapedium is resolved as stem
holosteans in Lopez-Arbarelo &
Sferco, 2018; R. Soc. Open Sci. !!
or 'flatten'?
I don't think that this is the best reference to
illustrate this issue. Quantitative diversity
studies would be more informative, for
instance Guinot & Cavin, 2015; Biological
Review)
I cannot see this position in
Arratia (2013). In this paper, she
reproduced a figure from the
paper Arratia (2000) showing
Dapedium as sister to pycnodonts
plus aspidoryhnchiforms (this
clade being sister clade to
pachycormiforms).
See comments
What about the subtree
mentioned in the
discussion and figured in
Supplementary figure?
But Tintori (1981) Ref. 61) described two genera
based on complete articulated specimens?!

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
“Page 9, line 7, “infraorbital canal”: I suggest rather ‘otic branch of
the infraorbital canal’ or more simply ’otic sensory canal’ to be more
specific (which is the commonest name for this portion of the canal in
neopterygians).”
[Response:] We have amended this to ‘otic sensory canal’.
“Fig. 6e: Please replace ‘pbc’ by ‘bhc’”
[Response:] We have corrected this as suggested.
“The title of reference 54 in the reference list is incomplete”
[Response:] We have amended this.
“I’m surprised that the authors do not mention the study of Rayner
(1948), who provided a pretty detailed description of a braincase of
Dapedius with the material and technics available at that time. This
study was completed and discussed then by Patterson (1975). These
pioneer works are essential steps that led to the present study.”
[Response:] This was an oversight on our part and we have added reference
to this important work to both the introduction and discussion. We thank the
reviewer for bringing it to our attention.
“In figure 10, the authors include the Dapediidae within the
holosteans (blue square); so why they did not list the “Holostei” and
the “Dapediidae” in the systematic palaeontology section (p. 6) (but
only Osteichthyes and Actinopterygii)?---"
[Response:] We have amended the systematic palaeontology section to
include reference to both Holostei and Dapediidae
“Page 6, line 5, “six characters were ordered”: which ones? Why they
were ordered? We know that this kind of decision may have a strong
impact in the calculation of the most parsimonious tree, so it is
important to explain here why the authors made this choice.”
[Response:] This has been amended to “Six characters (c,89, c91, c.151,
c.171, c.241, c.247, c.251) were ordered following Giles et al. (2017). “
“Page 20, line 25. No information about how the agreement subtree
was built is provided in the method section. Please add a reference
for this. I didn’t see the caption of the Supplementary Fig. 1a
(Agreement subtree) with the meaning of the coloured symbols along
the branches.”
[Response:] The following sentence has been added to the methods section:
“An agreement subtree was calculated in PAUP.”. The file with the coloured
symbols along the branches is the optimization tree rather than the
agreement subtree, and a legend has been added to this figure to explain the
symbols.
“The authors did not include pycnodontiforms in their analysis,
although this clade is regarded by several researchers as a potential
sister group to dapediids. They explain this choice by the fact that no
3D neurocranial remains of pycnodonts are available for being
included in the phylogenetic analysis. From my point of view, this
reason is certainly not sufficient to exclude pycnodonts from the
analysis because there are likely other terminal taxa in this analysis,
which equally do not show braincase characters. Scopulipiscis, on the
other hand, shows braincase characters, but braincase characters
only. This situation didn’t prevent the authors to include it in the
analysis.”
[Response:] Following the reviewer’s comments, we have updated our
analyses to include six pycnodont taxa and an additional 13 characters
pertaining to pycnodont anatomy. We have also substantially revised both
the introduction and discussion in order to take pycnodonts into account and
discuss their placement in our analysis.
“A surprising result of the phylogenetic analysis, not mentioned by
the authors, is that Amia, Caturus and Watsonulus are not resolved as
a monophyletic group (halecomorphs). I suppose that one reason that
can explain this situation is that the list of characters used in this
analysis is taken from previous studies that were mostly built to
decipher the relationships among non-neopterygians. There is no
information about this issue in the main text and everything should
be found in the SI. It would be interesting to have some more
information about the origin of this raw data (characters definitions)
in the main text.”
[Response:] Halecomorphs were resolved as paraphyletic in the parent
analysis of this matrix (Giles et al. 2017). However, following revisions to the
matrix related to the addition of pycnodonts, halecomorphs are now
resolved as monophyletic.
Supplementary Information with the list of characters:
“First: The list of characters is a bit obscure and difficult to be
assessed by the readers, especially in a .txt format. However, the
choice of the characters and the way to code them is fundamental for
the phylogenetic presented in the main text, and some more
attention should be given to the presentation. In particular:
- Please provide the references list at the end of the file.
- Please give the meaning of the abbreviations (“G”, “CH”, etc.)
- When opened as a World file, the SI is full of typos errors. This
reflects a lack of attention for this file, although it contains the core
information for building the phylogeny.”
[Response:] We have reformatted the supplementary information file to
make it easier to read. We have updated the source of each character (rather
than including abbreviations in the character name), added a reference list,
and corrected typos. We have also explicitly stated the taxonomic problem
that the analyses from which characters are sourced was originally designed
to tackle.
“As mentioned above, most of the characters used here have been
defined to understand relationships of osteichthyians as a whole
(Schultze, Cloutier, Ahlberg, Long) and non-neopterygian actinopts
(papers by Gardiner, Zhu, Friedman, Brazeau, Giles, Xu, Choo, Zhao,
Taverne, Poplin, Arratia, ). Only a few characters (24) were originally
defined to study ginglymodian relationships (Grande, Lopez-Arbarello,
Cavin) and, as far as I can judge, only three characters specifically
defined for addressing halecomorphs relationships (Grande & Bemis).
I hypothesize that the lack of characters specifically defined for
addressing holostean relationships together with the over-
representation of characters specifically defined for addressing non-
neopterygian relationships taken from previous studies, affect the
intrarelationships found among the holosteans, in particular the non-
monophyly of halecomorphs and, possibly, the position of the
dapediids.”
[Response:] While we agree with the reviewer that many characters are
taken from analyses that had a broader osteichthyan or non-neopterygian
actinopterygian focus, we argue that these characters are highly relevant to
understanding character evolution and polarity in neopterygians.
Furthermore, many of them are included in analyses focussed purely on
neopterygian analyses. We also disagree that there are insufficient
characters to address holostean relationships. In addition to those from non-
neopterygian analyses, our characters are drawn from a large number of
analyses with a focus on neopterygian and/or holostean relationships (e.g.
Patterson 1973; Olsen & McCune 1991; Grande & Bemis 1998; Cavin &
Suteethorn 2006; Hurley 2007; Grande 2010; López-Arbarello 2012;
Bermúdez-Rochas & Poyato-Ariza 2015; Poyato-Ariza 2015; Thies &
Waschkewitz, 2015; Xu & Shen 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Gibson 2016; Xu &
Zhao, 2016; López-Arbarello & Sferco 2018). For most of these analyses,
between 30% and 70% of their characters are included here. Each character
has been carefully considered and, where not included, this decision has
been made either on the basis of the character being being problematic (c.f.
Brazeau 2011) or too specific (e.g. focussed on ginglymodians. This confusion
is in part due to a lack of character references in the supplementary file, and
we have now rectified this. We note that a future effort that aims to more
completely combine this matrix with that of López-Arbarello & Sferco (2018)
is in preparation (we had initially intended to tackle the position of
pycnodonts in that analysis).
“Eventually, the authors should quote and discuss the recent paper
bublished by Lopez-Arbarello & Sferco 2018: Neopterygian
phylogeny: the merger assay. R. Soc. open sci. 5: 172337.
http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.172337. (it is possible that this paper
was not yet out when the ms was submitted). It is worth noting that
this research also resolves the dapediids as stem-holosteans on the
basis of a very different datamatrix. “
[Response:] This paper was released after we had submitted our manuscript,
but we have now included references to it.
I added some comments in the pdf file.
[Response:] Please see below.
[Response:] An incorrect reference was inserted here, and we have corrected
it to ‘Guinot & Cavin, 2015; Clarke et al., 2016’.

[Response:] We have removed this reference.
[Response:] We have added the following sentence: ‘An agreement subtree
was calculated in PAUP.’.

Reviewer: 2
“I had the opportunity to read the first version of this article, and I
note that all my suggestions have been addressed in this revised
version. In particular, the authors included in the phylogenetic
analysis the pycnodonts. This certainly required a substantial work,
but I think that the results are now more relevant because
pycnodonts have often been associated to dapediids. Incidentally, the
inclusion of pycnodonts lowers the resolution among dapediids and
at the base of the tree and, surprisingly, a new clade is formed
including bichir and sturgeon (not present in the first analysis). I don’t
mean that it is the place here to discuss further these results, which
do not concerned the topic of this paper, but it shows that the
topology obtained for these non-neopterygians is still rather weak (as
it is also the case for some parts of the neopterygian tree). Anyway,
the cladogram of the Actinopterygii will certainly be altered with
future works, but the anatomical description, which forms the core of
this study, and which is excellent, will last for decades.
I consider that the paper can be published in its present form.”
[Response:] We agree that the bichir and sturgeon clade is incongruent, and
have added a brief comment mentioning this. Further work is currently
focussing on this problem.
