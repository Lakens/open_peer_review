Zhang et al. established a model for fluid films on the cuticle of the proboscis with coil structure
using hollow fiber. And they designed a reasonable experiment to prove the model. However, the
engineering application mentioned is not convincing for me. The material used in experiments
should be pointed out clearly as well. I recommend the publication of this work in Journal of
Royal Society Open Science if the authors address my following minor concerns:
1. In section X, the author claimed the designed model could be applied in making a fabric with a
gradient of coloration at loop scale. However, for textile industry, dying process applies to single
yarn, but not knitted fabric. I don't think this model can be used for textile.
2. In page 10, the author use fiber to explain the appearance of droplets on proboscises of long-
tongued butterflies and moths. Personally, I would like to know what kind of fiber it is? The
chemical component and the specific surface surface structure of fibers should be taken into
consideration.

The paper is very well-written and discusses interesting science in butterfly's or moth's proboscis
and engineering applications. Adding engineering applications or real-world problems is novel
and important even though the idea is under development, as opposed to the first reviewer. The
paper theoretically describes the laplace pressure of a thin film in a toroidal structure like a
butterfly's proboscis, which is novel and interesting to me.

The paper studies the proboscises collecting liquids based on their geometry. The hollowed and
curved proboscises provide the surface tension gradient due to the curvature inside and outside
the tube. The study shows the result experimentally and theoretically. However, the theory of
this paper is hard to follow to general readers. The sections also need to be organized. I list my
comments as below.
1. In eq (1), how would alpha geometrically related to a, b x, and Z?
2. Many labels are not consistent. The whole manuscript should be proofread. For example, in 47
on page 4, a is longer than b in Figure 2(b), but a is the “short” semi-axis in the caption. In line 20-
22, commas and the symbol “theta” are missing. Same in Table 1.
3. In the first 4 lines on page 6, the values of h, a, b, and r should be given.
4. In eq (3), the discussion on the magnitude of r1 and r2 might simplify the following derivation
of the model, such as straight elliptical proboscis on page 9 and circular proboscis on page 15.
5. The first line on page 7, what are the derivatives respect to?
6. Section VI includes reduction of the model in special cases, the experiments, and the numerical
perdition of the models. More organized subsections will improve the readability. Same for other
sections.
7. On page 10 and 11, more experimental details are required, such as the frame rate per second
of the high-speed filming, the speed of the stage, and the dimension of the capillary tube.
8. In Figure 5, (b)-(i) are in low resolution. Also better layout to match (j), (k), (l) to the referring
subfigures will improve the readability.
9. In Figure 8, (a) to (c) is the transition from gravity dominated to surface tension dominated
droplet forming, which should be discussed in the text. In line 20 on page 16, the Bond number in
4
the order of one suggests that surface tension and gravity are in the same magnitude. The volume
V and Bo should be given/discussed.
10. The definition of theta_c is missing.
11. The parameters in Table 1 should also have the real values/range from proboscises if possible.
