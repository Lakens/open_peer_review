This is a relatively well written paper presenting valuable results and insights from the analysis
of a relatively long-term, large-scale data set based on tagged Cuvier’s beaked whales in the
Southern California Bight in response to U.S. Navy mid-frequency sonar.
Many of my edits and comments (n=31) are minor grammatical edits that do not effect the
fundamentals of the manuscript. These could be readily resolved by careful reading and editing
by several of the multiple authors.
The summary is very readable and does not overstate the results.
As one goes deeper I think there’s an important message in here, but it is not so easy to distill.
The data are never readily visible to the reader except through many paragraphs that require
multiple levels of explanation, which describe data pruning, data exceptions etc. Thus, for
example, it would be valuable for a reader if there was a figure showing a time line and some
associated time-varying data. This would increase a reader’s appreciation for the extent of the
data and the distances from MFAS over which dive data were available. In the figures this gets
lost.
Although I do not consider myself qualified to provide expert opinion in the GAM statistical
processes that were applied, my interpretation is that the authors were very thorough in their
analyses and stayed on course in their interpretations of their analytical results.
The discussion is thorough. The conclusion was adequate, and mostly seemed like a rewording of
previous text along with the usual “what could we do in the future” fluff. The final paragraph
was a disappointment and just sort of fell off the back of the chair. What the authors need to do is
focus their collective minds on the project and results, do some serious thinking out of the
limitation of this sand box and imagine what this implies for these remarkable animals: animals
that spend most of their lives hunting in darkness at depths and for durations that are nearly
impossible for humans to comprehend. That would be the context in which to write a crescendo
for this remarkable piece of work, which not so long ago would have seemed impossible.
Remember, this research and all the efforts supporting it, were not undertaken to enable this
publication, they were, after all, undertaken to discover, inform and enable wise decisions in
support of marine life.
Some details:
Page 2, Line 42: Methods: Somewhere in the methods, it would be very valuable to include a
spectrogram figure showing an actual example of the MFAS types and a sonar “bout”. As it is
now, the reader has no idea what an actual MFAS exposure scenario would look like.
Page 3, Line 15: It would be good to define what is meant by a "bout".
Page 4, Lines 13-14: Relatively wide (i.e. generous) levels of uncertainty.
Page 4, Line 14: What defines "good temporal and spatial agreement"?
Page 4, Line 20: This means no sonar within the range, but not sonar that was off-range?
Page 4, Line 39: Insert "of" so as to read "... from the start of the deep dive ...."
3
Page 4, Line 39: Replace "it" with "the interval"
Page 4, Line 43: Shouldn't "and" be "or": “whale or the platform”?
Page 4, Line 44: What's a "small number"?
Page 4, Line 49: Insert a comma before "but".
Page 4, Line 50: Insert "SOAR" after “outside”?
Page 5, Line 5: Something missing here. Should this read: "likely to include gaps."?
Page 5, Line 6: Would read better if "of" was "for"?
Page 5, Line 46: Would read better if "of" was "for"?
Page 5, Line 58: Shouldn't this read: "..., and dive duration when dive depth was the response
variable."??
Page 5, Line 60: Maybe try to reduce ambiguity by reducing the use of pronouns and increasing
the use of nouns: so edit to read "... of the IDDI that followed the deep dive..." ??
Page 6, Line 3 (the top two lines on this page had no numbers): Insert a comma before but?
Page 6, Line 28: Insert "to" between "predicted increase".
Page 6, Line 39: Insert "MFAS use" after "high-power"?
Page 8, Line 20: Comma before "but".
Page 8, Line 27: It's not clear what "and how its position is changing through time" means here.
Why not say "and how the ship's position is changing through time"?
Page 8, Lines 31-33: So the operational protocol for a particular MFAS could be referred to as an
MFAS operational context, and thus an analog to an animal's behavioral-ecological context?
Page 8, Lines 57-60: But there is no attempt to estimate exposure levels other than very simple
metrics. Why no discussion on this aspect of the diving animal's actual experience? Or maybe this
was really unrealistic because of the coarseness of the tag data?
Page 9, Lines 25-26: This sentence is unclear: "This was despite that geographic area..."???
Page 10, Line 21: Don't you want to refer to the area as the Southern California Bight? Southern
California is terrain not marine.
Page 10, Lines 21-23: The whales did not use MFAS. Better to use "during": "... 16 whales during
periods with and without MFAS, ...."
Page 10, Lines 47-51: This paragraph is disappointing and not an appropriately strong ending to
this important story. It needs to be rewritten, please. The first sentence is okay. The second is
awkward and oblique. The third and last is predictable, unnecessarily convoluted and off-target
from the major import of this study ("predispose whales elsewhere to harm"! Huh?)
Page 11, Lines 24-25: The initials here, which include a middle initial, don't match the names in
the list of authors, which do not include a middle initial. Important?
4
Page 17, Table 1 caption: Delete comma after "summary". Why "by" and not "per" or "for each"?
Page 17, Table 2 caption: Table headings are not clear. What does "Bouts of use" mean: the bout
sample size? What does "Median Bout Dur (Range) (min)" mean? Why is "Range" in caps? Does
"min" mean minimum or minute? Maybe explain table terms in the caption so that one can read
the caption and view the table without difficulty understanding terms?
Page 17, Figure 2: When the term OL is used in a figure axis label, the axis goes from 0 to 1, but
for a reader this is incomplete. Either in a caption for a figure or in the figure there needs to be
some way for the reader to know or remember what a value for OL means.
Page 17, Figure 4: The titles at the tops of the "A" and "B" figures, "MFAS in Operation", are
confusing because one of its four panels is labeled "None", which means that the MFAS was NOT
in operation. Wouldn't it be better to label the title something more like "MFAS Condition"? Then
the "None" makes sense.
Also, because the panel contents are so small, there is no really obvious difference between the
model results for the different conditions. For example, one has to study them with squinting
eyes to see that the slopes are different. Since these figure results are pretty central to the main
messages of the paper, it would really help the cause to make them easier to look at and decipher.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This is a very interesting study with a quite unique dataset. Other than minor comments and
suggested edits included in the attached pdf version of the manuscript, I see three important
points to consider in the revision:
1- It seems the fact that these extreme deep divers need to cope with nitrogen supersaturation is
not considered in the interpretation of results and potential negative effects by behavioural
responses to MFAS. The discussion seems to be centered around oxygen demands of prolonged
dives and hypoxia recovery after deep long dives, but equally or more important is the need for
5
release of high nitrogen concentration in blood without entering into decompression sickness.
Even if this subject is still a topic of active debate within the analysis of mass strandings related to
MFAS, this manuscript does not even mention this physiological limitation and its role in
shaping the diving and surfacing behavior of this species. I would encourage to make an effort to
integrate this topic into the discussion. See my comments in some discussion sections where this
subject is really needed. The data and results you have are quite unique to address this subject.
2- There is no mention of beaked whale population structure or seasonality in the study region,
but some statements suggest the tagged whales might well be long-term residents in the SOAR.
This could lead to habituation, sensitization, and other exposure related effects that might alter
the type and degree of behavioural responses to MFAS ensonification. Because the aim of the
study was to document and quantify these responses, one would expect this manuscript to
discuss how these population characteristics could explain differences within the results and
between the results presented here and the ones described in other regions where beaked whales
and sonar exposures have been studied.
3- Even if the aim of the study was to determine whether MFAS use was associated with
behavioural changes in this species, some sections (abstract, introduction) spin the text towards a
more analytical study to improve our understanding on the potential negative effects of MFAS in
this species. The manuscript presents clear diving and surfacing responses to MFAS exposure,
but barely relates these documented responses to potential negative effects. The increased inter-
deep-dive-interval is presented as a proxy for foraging disruption, but the discussion stops there.
This subject should be expanded, and not just to IDDI results. This is of particular importance in
an area where MFAS is recurrently used and where beaked whales might well be chronically
exposed to this acoustic disturbance.
Other than these 3 points and other minor comments in the attached pdf, the study is quite
impressive and I congratulate the authors for their contribution worth publishing in this journal.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
I'm quite familiar with this paper since I provided a courtesy review prior to submission; this is
an excellent study which addresses a controversial, high-profile topic using innovative methods
8
on a species is - to say the least - logistically challenging. The paper is well written and carefully
thought out, and I'm glad to see the referees both agree.
The authors should address the various reviewer comments in their revision, but I see no obstacle
to accepting this now on that basis. I expect to see a lot of press on this when it's published, given
the nature of the issue and the conclusion regarding reaction at distance.

This is a relatively well written paper presenting valuable results and insights from the analysis
of a relatively long-term, large-scale data set based on tagged Cuvier’s beaked whales in the
Southern California Bight in response to U.S. Navy mid-frequency sonar.
Many of my edits and comments (n=31) are minor grammatical edits that do not effect the
fundamentals of the manuscript. These could be readily resolved by careful reading and editing
by several of the multiple authors.
The summary is very readable and does not overstate the results.
As one goes deeper I think there’s an important message in here, but it is not so easy to distill.
The data are never readily visible to the reader except through many paragraphs that require
multiple levels of explanation, which describe data pruning, data exceptions etc. Thus, for
example, it would be valuable for a reader if there was a figure showing a time line and some
associated time-varying data. This would increase a reader’s appreciation for the extent of the
data and the distances from MFAS over which dive data were available. In the figures this gets
lost.
Although I do not consider myself qualified to provide expert opinion in the GAM statistical
processes that were applied, my interpretation is that the authors were very thorough in their
analyses and stayed on course in their interpretations of their analytical results.
The discussion is thorough. The conclusion was adequate, and mostly seemed like a rewording of
previous text along with the usual “what could we do in the future” fluff. The final paragraph
was a disappointment and just sort of fell off the back of the chair. What the authors need to do is
focus their collective minds on the project and results, do some serious thinking out of the
limitation of this sand box and imagine what this implies for these remarkable animals: animals
that spend most of their lives hunting in darkness at depths and for durations that are nearly

30 1. Summary
31
Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) have stranded in association with mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS) use,
32
and though the causative mechanism linking these events remains unclear, it is believed to be behaviourally mediated. To
33
determine whether MFAS use was associated with behavioural changes in this species, satellite tags were used to record
34 the diving and movements of 16 Cuvier's beaked whales for up to 88 days in a region of frequent MFAS training off the
35 coast of Southern California. Tag data were combined with summarized records of concurrent bouts of high-power,
36 surface ship and mid-power, helicopter-deployed MFAS use, along with other potential covariates, in generalized
37 additive mixed-effects models. Deep dives, shallow dives, and surface intervals tended to become longer during MFAS
38 use, with some variation associated with total amount of overlapping MFAS during the behaviour. These changes in dives
39 and surface intervals contributed to a longer interval between deep dives, a proxy for foraging disruption in this species.
40 Most responses intensified with proximity and were more pronounced during mid-power than high-power MFAS use at
41 comparable distances within ~ 50 km, despite the significantly lower source level of mid-power MFAS. However,
42 distance-mediated responses to high-power MFAS, and increased deep dive intervals during mid-power MFAS, were
43 evident up to ~100 km away.

46 2. Introduction
47
48 Beaked whale species (Family Ziphiidae) have been observed to strand in association with the use of mid-frequency
49 active sonars (hereafter "MFAS"), such as those used by military vessels around the world to search for quiet submarines
50 [1–3]. Despite mounting public concern and considerable research in the years since these stranding events were first
51 observed [4–10], the causative link between MFAS exposure and whale mortality remains unclear, as do any sub-lethal
52 individual effects and population-level impacts that may arise from long-term, cumulative exposures. Consequently,
53 current methods for estimating the impacts of MFAS use on beaked whales involve considerable uncertainty, and few
54 suitable approaches have been identified to mitigate these risks.
55
One inherent challenge in studying the relationship between beaked whales and MFAS is the nature of the whales
56 themselves. Beaked whales were minimally studied prior to 1999, when interest in these species increased following the

aforementioned MFAS-associated stranding events. Tagging studies revealed that these deep-water cetaceans are
prodigious divers, and that they tend to perform a stereotypic pattern of deep, foraging dives separated by a series of
1 shallower, non-foraging dives [11,12]. Of the small number of species that have been fitted with dive-recording tags,
2 Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris), in particular, have conducted dives far exceeding those of any other
3 mammal in both depth and duration [13].
4
5 Cuvier's beaked whales are also the species that has most frequently stranded in association with MFAS use [3]. This
6 coincidence of extreme, yet stereotypic, diving behaviour and apparent sensitivity to MFAS has suggested that these
7 mortalities may be behaviourally mediated. That beaked whales alter their behaviour in response to simulated and real
8 MFAS use, at both individual and group levels, is no longer generally questioned. At the Atlantic Undersea Test and
9 Evaluation Center (AUTEC) in the Bahamas, for example, shifts in Blainville's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris)
10 vocal activity suggest that whales move off the testing range during multi-day, multi-ship exercises that include MFAS
11 use [7,14,15]. Two Cuvier's beaked whales tagged as part of a controlled-exposure experiment near the Southern
California Anti-submarine Warfare Range (SOAR) rapidly moved away from simulated MFAS at close range (3.4-9.5
12
km) and low received sound levels, and ceased or did not initiate foraging in the hours following exposure [9]. However,
13
one of these tagged whales did not respond to distant (>40 km) real high-power MFAS at comparable received levels to
14 the simulated signal, suggesting that source proximity, in addition to received level, influences response [9]. These
15 behavioural changes (foraging disruption and displacement from foraging habitats) have potential long-term
16 consequences if repeated exposures result in a reduction of individual energy stores [14,16]. Individual beaked whales
17 have exhibited long-term site fidelity to both AUTEC and SOAR despite regular MFAS use there [17,18], suggesting
18 they do not routinely respond to MFAS on these ranges in a manner that leads directly to mortality. Therefore, it is
19 important to understand how and when they do respond, and the long-term, cumulative effect that these repeated
20 responses may have on individuals and populations.
21
22 Understanding the effects of repeated exposure is particularly relevant off the coast of southern California. MFAS is used
23 regularly throughout the broad Southern California Range Complex (SOCAL), though exercises including it are often
24 concentrated on or near SOAR (Figure 1); this is an approximately 2200 km2 area that extends west from San Clemente
Island throughout much of the San Nicolas Basin and contains 117 bottom-mounted hydrophones. In addition to the high-
25
power, hull-mounted MFAS that has received the most research attention to date, these exercises also often include less
26 powerful sound sources, such as helicopter-deployed, dipping MFAS systems, active sonobuoys, acoustic
27 countermeasures, and pingers [19]. Training occurs year-round in SOCAL and on SOAR, in configurations ranging from
28 single platform exercises lasting less than an hour to multi-day coordinated events including multiple ships, helicopters,
29 and other sound sources. There are also exercises that do not include sonar, but which do include other noise-generating
30 activities such as explosions and arms fire [19].
31
32 Opportunistic data collection from Cuvier's beaked whales in southern California yields sizeable samples of behaviour
33 with and without MFAS use, across the broad range of spatial and temporal contexts at which exposures and responses
34 may occur. Here, we combined extended behavioural records from Cuvier's beaked whales satellite-tagged on or near
35 SOAR from 2011 to 2015 with coincident records of MFAS use in the region, including both the high-power surface-ship
36 MFAS that has been the focus of earlier behavioural response research and mid-power dipping MFAS, the effects of
37 which have received little prior study. We also identified periods that were confirmed free of MFAS use. The resulting
dataset afforded the first opportunity to characterize behaviour of whales in this population in the presence and absence of
38
two commonly used MFAS systems.

42 3. Methods
43
44 Behavioural data collection
45
46 Cuvier's beaked whales were tagged with Wildlife Computers SPLASH10 transmitters in the Low Impact Minimally
47 Percutaneous External-electronics Transmitter (LIMPET) configuration, which were programmed and deployed as
described by Schorr et al. [13]. Location estimates of tagged whales were provided by the Argos system based on the
48
least-squares estimation method. Tags transmitted a record of diving behaviour in the form of a "Behaviour Log" (BL).
49 Each BL record represented a summarized "Dive" or "Surfacing" event: dives were recorded when the whale exceeded
50 the user-defined threshold of >50 m depth for >30 sec duration and each dive record included the start and end time, the
51 maximum depth reached, the total duration, and an approximate dive shape based upon the proportion of time spent
52 below 80% of the maximum recorded depth [20]. Surfacing events summarized the period of time between each
53 qualifying dive. All dives were passed through a K-means cluster analysis, which assigned them into either "deep" or
54 "shallow" classes as a function of maximum depth and total duration, on a per-individual basis, to control for individual
55 behavioural variation.
56
57 BL data were recovered via the Argos satellite system and, beginning in 2014, a land-based Argos receiving station (the
58 Wildlife Computers Mote) installed on San Clemente Island; this significantly improved BL data throughput in later tags.
59 Argos location estimates were filtered using the Douglas Argos Filter [21] with settings defined in [13]. All filtered
locations were fitted by a continuous-time correlated random walk movement model using the R package crawl [22] to

2 estimate each whale's position every 30 minutes with a 95% confidence interval around each location estimate. The
3 resultant modelled locations were passed through the Mysticetus Observation System (v1.8.0.124, Entiat River
4 Technologies, Preston, WA, USA) to extract the bottom depth, slope, and aspect, to assign locations to user-defined
5 geographic sub-areas (Figure 1), and to determine whether each modelled location fell within the SOAR boundaries. Each
6 dive and surfacing event in the BL was associated with the modelled location that occurred closest in time to the event
7 start. The start time and location of each BL event were passed through a solar calculator
(http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/calcdetails.html) to estimate the solar elevation at the event start; solar
8
elevation data were used to classify each event as starting in the Dawn (solar elevation from -12 to +6 degrees of the
9 horizon, bracketing sunrise), Dusk (+6 to -12 degrees, bracketing sunset), Day (> +6 degrees), or Night (< -12 degrees)
10 periods.
11
12 Sonar data collection and compilation
13
14 Two sources of MFAS use data from southern California were referenced for this study. The first was the US Navy's
15 internal Sonar Positional Reporting System (SPORTS) database. SPORTS contains bouts of summarized sonar use from
16 throughout the broad SOCAL operating area, which include the start time, start latitude and longitude, end time, and
17 sonar type. "High-power" source types in SPORTS include hull-mounted surface ship MFAS, such as the AN/SQS-53C,
18 with a published nominal frequency of 3.5 kHz and source level of 235 dB re 1µPa @ 1m (dB) [23]. "Mid-power" source
19 types refer to dipping MFAS, such as the AN/AQS-22, which is similar to surface ship MFAS, but with a published
nominal frequency of 4.1 kHz and source level of 217 dB [23]. The SPORTS database was queried for bouts of high-
20
power and mid-power MFAS use during periods when tags were transmitting. All SPORTS reports with a start position
21
outside the boundaries of SOAR were classified as such. Because SPORTS records are both manually captured at sea and
22 later manually entered into the database, there are several steps where transcription errors can occur. Suspect reports (e.g.
23 unusual locations, durations, or movements when subsequent reports were known to come from the same platform) were
24 provided to SPORTS data managers and corrected when possible, though in some cases no obvious correction was
25 provided. These records were retained as reported.
26
27 The second source of sonar use data was the SOAR hydrophone array. Marine mammal passive acoustic detection reports
28 from SOAR hydrophones have been archived since 2008 as part of the Marine Mammal Monitoring on Ranges (M3R)
29 program [24]. In addition to detection reports of vocalizing animals, M3R archives can provide an accurate record of
30 MFAS used on or near SOAR, and just as importantly, a definitive record of times when no high- or mid-power sonar is
31 present. The M3R data processing procedures are described fully in Jarvis et al. [24]. The analogue output from each
32 hydrophone is digitized. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with a rectangular window and 50% overlap (a sampling
frequency of 96 kHz results in a frequency resolution of 46.875 Hz and a time step of 10.67 ms) is performed on each
33
hydrophone channel. An adaptive, noise-variable threshold based on an exponential average is run on every bin of the
34 FFT. Bins with energy above the threshold are set to 1 and those below to 0. A detection report is generated for each FFT
35 from each hydrophone. Each report contains the FFT start time, hydrophone number, hard-limited binary frequency bin
36 data (0/1), sampling frequency, FFT size, peak frequency, and number of bins above threshold. These detection reports
37 are incorporated into the M3R archives. To verify transient signals in both real-time and post-recording, the “hard-
38 limited” FFT data are combined to provide a 2D spectrogram display for a given hydrophone on demand.
39
40 The FFT detector reports were processed through an automated sonar detector that outputs the occurrence of MFAS pings
41 within a specified frequency band and time duration. The start time, number of FFT bins, duration, peak frequency, and
42 peak level for signals that exceeded the frequency and duration (number of consecutive FFT bins) thresholds were
43 provided. The MFAS detector created a record for any signal with a duration longer than 1 second within a chosen
44 frequency band. Therefore, false positive detections (particularly of delphinid whistles) were common. Additionally, the
detector reports all detections on any hydrophone; it does not correlate detections of the same signal across multiple
45
hydrophones. To filter out false detections, the MFAS detector output was plotted in Matlab 2015a (Mathworks, Inc.,
46
Natick, MA) in two ways: (1) detection time vs. peak level and (2) detection time vs. time since last detection on the
47 same hydrophone (inter-detection interval). Given the array geometry, if the source was on SOAR it was typically within
48 3 km of the nearest hydrophone. Therefore, distinct, high-level pings were detected at regular intervals consistent with
49 typical MFAS transmissions. Detection of pings from sources outside SOAR could result in lower received levels, but the
50 inter-detection interval and source frequencies also remained consistent with MFAS transmissions.
51
52 For each MFAS period detected through visual inspection of the output plots, the start time, end time, closest hydrophone
53 (based on ping arrival times), and an estimate of type (high- or mid-power) were recorded. A MFAS period was
54 considered continuous provided the inter-detection interval on any single hydrophone was less than three minutes. For
55 platforms that moved during transmission, the closest hydrophone was updated throughout the MFAS period. Periods
56 with multiple overlapping MFAS sources were distinguished by (1) “spread” in the inter-detection interval (due to arrival
57 time differences between the two sources on different hydrophones), and (2) rapidly changing closest hydrophone.
58
M3R archives were manually reviewed using 2D spectrograms for most periods of detections to confirm the presence,
59 location, and type of MFAS. Archives were always manually reviewed for times when the detector output plots indicated
60 multiple overlapping sources. MFAS type was determined by signal characteristics and by localization to a known

platform reported in the area in the Range Operations Center event schedule (helicopter, guided missile destroyer, guided
missile frigate, etc.). Custom M3R localization software was used to determine the location of MFAS detections by
1 calculating time of arrival differences on a minimum of three manually-selected non-collinear hydrophones [25].
2 Detection localizations were then compared to the recorded track positions of event vessels provided by Range
3 Operations Center, when available, to confirm source platform type.
4
5 Because high-resolution, ping-level MFAS data from the archive were combined with low-resolution, summarized MFAS
6 data from SPORTS to recreate a comprehensive record of use, continuous periods of MFAS use originating from the
7 same platform in the archive were summarized into bouts as reported in SPORTS (start time and location, end time, type).
8 When an accurate localization could not be derived for detections originating outside SOAR, they were associated with
9 the position of the nearest edge phone on which the signal was detected as the best available location. Though the
10 positions associated with these off-SOAR detections were known to be inaccurate, they provided a general location for
11 screening against concurrent bouts in SPORTS. The two datasets were then compared to identify probable duplicate
records (i.e. bouts that were reported in SPORTS and also recorded in the M3R archive) by calculating the differences in
12
start time, end time, total duration of use, and distance between the starting positions for all bouts of MFAS of the same
13
type in each data source. Any bouts of the same sonar type that differed by less than 15 minutes in any time metric and
14 started within 10 km of each other were manually reviewed as potential duplicates. Those bouts with good temporal and
15 spatial agreement in multiple metrics between the two data sources were identified as likely duplicate records. The final
16 combined dataset used in analysis included: all on-SOAR MFAS use detected in the archive; all off-SOAR MFAS use
17 reported to SPORTS; any off-SOAR MFAS use detected in the archive that was not reported in SPORTS (with low
18 accuracy positions); and any on-SOAR MFAS use that was reported in SPORTS during periods when the archive was
19 unavailable. The dataset excluded any on-SOAR SPORTS reports that occurred during MFAS-free periods confirmed by
20 the archive. It also explicitly included all spans of time when SOAR was confirmed to be free of high- or mid-power
21 MFAS.
22
23 Behavioural and sonar data integration
24
The combined, reconciled MFAS data were then integrated with the BL data from the tags. Each BL record was screened
25
for temporal overlap with bouts of MFAS use, and, where found, the distance between the estimated position of the
26 tagged animal and the start position of each overlapping MFAS bout was calculated ("Dist"), as was the proportion of the
27 behavioural event during which that MFAS source was in use (overlap "OL", ranging from 0 if no MFAS was in use to 1
28 if MFAS was in use throughout the entire behaviour). Additionally, a vector was created between each whale position and
29 the start position of any overlapping MFAS bouts, and the shallowest depth along the vector was extracted from an
30 etopo2v2 bathymetry grid using ArcGIS version 10.3.1. Any vectors that crossed emergent land masses (i.e. shallowest
31 depth along vector > 0) were used to exclude that exposure under the premise that any sound emitted would likely have
32 been blocked or severely attenuated at the whale. For modelling purposes, when multiple bouts of the same sonar type
33 occurred during a single behavioural event, whether from a single platform transmitting sequentially or separate
34 platforms, use was summarized for each sonar type as presence/absence, distance to the nearest transmission, and
35 combined overlap with all platforms (i.e. the sum of all overlapping minutes of sonar use/behaviour duration).
36
37 The following behavioural parameters were assessed for variation as a function of time of day, geographic area, and
MFAS exposure: deep dive duration, shallow dive duration, shallow dive depth, surface interval duration, and the inter-
38
deep-dive-interval (IDDI, the duration from the end of one deep dive to the start of the next). MFAS exposure for the
39 IDDI was summarized from the start the deep dive that preceded the interval to the start of the deep dive that ended it in
40 order to account for exposure at any time in the deep dive cycle. Two sets of data were created for each behavioural
41 parameter: 1. data where both the whale and the transmitting platform were within the boundaries of SOAR (the "SOAR"
42 dataset), and 2. the "Complete" dataset, which included all behavioural and MFAS data regardless of the location of the
43 whale and the platform. The SOAR dataset, selected for temporal and spatial accuracy, included only the highest
44 confidence MFAS use data. This dataset included only a small number of unconfirmed MFAS bouts that were reported in
45 SPORTS when the archive was unavailable, and all MFAS-free periods were confirmed as such. Behavioural events
46 during periods when MFAS use was not reported in SPORTS, but for which archives were not available to verify that
47 SOAR was truly MFAS-free, were omitted from the SOAR dataset due to uncertainty.
48
49 The Complete dataset, which was selected for sample size but subject to greater uncertainty in MFAS use, increased the
range of whale-MFAS distances in the analysis by adding both behaviour and MFAS data from outside to the SOAR
50
dataset. It included all known exposures except those that occurred with a land mass between the whale and the
51
transmitting platform. Also included were behavioural events from periods when MFAS was not reported in SPORTS,
52 but for which its absence could not be verified because the whale was either outside SOAR or inside range boundaries
53 during a period when the archives were not recorded. The Complete dataset included geographic area as a covariate by
54 assigning each behaviour to a sub-area within the region (San Nicolas Basin, Catalina Basin, Santa Cruz Basin, or
55 Outside these basins) (Figure 1).
56
57 Data analysis
58
59 Each behavioural dataset was analysed using generalized additive mixed-effects models (GAMMs) fitted in R statistical
60 computing software [26] using the mgcv [27], gamm4 (gamm4 function; [28]) and MuMIn (uGamm and dredge

2 functions; [29]) packages. Models were fitted for each of the five response variables of interest (deep dive duration,
3 shallow dive duration, shallow dive depth, surfacing interval duration, and IDDI), with separate models fitted to the
4 SOAR and Complete datasets in each case [30]. IDDI observations were weighted (by IDDI divided by minimum IDDI)
5 to account for a bias toward shorter intervals created by gaps in the BL, since intervals that included missing data were
6 excluded from the IDDI dataset, and long intervals were likely include gaps. Each model included two candidate
7 parameterizations of the effects of MFAS on the response variables. First, we fitted models in which the effect of each
MFAS type (high- and/or mid- power) was a smooth function of source-to-whale distance (specifically, each smooth was
8
a shrinkage cubic regression spline with a basis of dimension 5, specified in R using the function “s” from the mgcv
9 package with bs=”cs” and k=5). For cases with no MFAS, this smooth term was multiplied by 0 using the “by” input to
10 the “s” function, with the source-whale distance set to an arbitrarily large value of 500 km to avoid numerical problems.
11 We also fitted models in which the presence of MFAS had constant effects (regardless of distance) by including a
12 categorical predictor variable with values: no MFAS, high-power present, mid-power present, or both types present. We
13 compared models where both high- and mid-power MFAS had distance-dependent effects to models where both had
14 constant effects. In addition, for all response variables except surface intervals, which were so short relative to most
15 MFAS bouts that most OL values were 1, we included OL as another potential MFAS-related linear numerical predictor
16 in each model. As appropriate for each response variable and dataset, we also considered time of day, region, and surface
17 sequence (categorical position of the surface interval in the deep dive cycle, e.g. immediately following a deep dive,
18 between shallow dives, immediately preceding a deep dive, etc.) [13] as potential categorical predictors; and dive depth
19 or dive duration as potential (linear) numerical predictors (Table 4). To account for differences between whales, all
models also included a random effect of individual whale. In cases where inspection of a plot of the residual
20
autocorrelation function indicated that this random effect was not sufficient to reduce temporal residual autocorrelation to
21
acceptable levels, we achieved the reduction by adding a second (nested) random effect of shorter time-periods (2, 3, 4, 6,
22 or 12 hours) within whales, selecting the single time-period that minimized Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) for the
23 full model. For each response variable, within each of the Complete and SOAR datasets, Akaike’s information criterion
24 (AIC) was minimized to select the best model, considering all possible combinations of candidate predictors. AIC weight
25 was used to indicate the relative probability of the best model over competing models for each response variable and
26 dataset [31]. Prediction plots were generated to represent the shape and magnitude of the effect for each MFAS predictors
27 included in each best model. For these plots, the values of all other predictors in each model were fixed at the median (for
28 numerical predictors) or modal value (categorical predictors) from no sonar periods. In all prediction plots the time of day
29 was fixed at “Night”, and where Basin was included in a best model of the Complete dataset, its value was fixed at “San
30 Nic”. Other fixed values varied among models and are included in each figure caption.
31
32 4. Results
33
34 Behavioural data from the 16 tagged whales included in the study are summarized in Table 1. The reconciled MFAS data
35 contained 790 bouts of high- and mid-power use totalling 913 hrs, which are summarized by data source, type, and
36 geographic area in Table 2. It also included 369 MFAS-free periods on SOAR, totalling 4,867 hrs. A sub-set of 122 of
37 these periods (983.4 hrs) that were identified by the automated sonar detector, were reviewed manually to estimate the
38 false negative rate associated with automated detections. In 2011 data, the first year new hydrophones were integrated
39 into the M3R architecture, MFAS of either type was detected on SOAR in manual review during 5.45% of 257.5 hrs of
40 time that the detector classified as MFAS-free. In subsequent years (725.9 hrs reviewed) the false negative rate was
41 reduced to 0.46%. All errors detected in manual review were corrected in the final sonar data.
42
The combined behaviour-MFAS database contained 2,189 dives and surface intervals (8.2% of all recorded) that occurred
43
while high- or mid-power MFAS was being used at distances ranging from 1.9 - 419.4 km to the whale. The data
44 included 1,950 IDDIs, 303 (15.5%) of which coincided, or immediately followed a deep dive, with high- or mid-power
45 MFAS use. The distribution of exposures by response variable is summarized in Table 3. Of 1,943 dives and surface
46 intervals that were exposed to high-power sonar, 312 (16%) coincided with more than one bout. Overlap with multiple
47 bouts of high-power MFAS occurred at similar rates in the sample of exposed deep and shallow dives (both ~17%) and
48 surface intervals (15%), because high-power bouts were typically longer than all three behaviours [13] (Table 2), and
49 exposure to multiple bouts of high-power MFAS was most often due to multiple ships transmitting simultaneously. In
50 contrast, overlap with multiple bouts of mid-power MFAS in any exposed behaviour was more common, though the
51 frequency varied considerably between exposed deep dives (57%), shallow dives (38%), and surface intervals (5%). This
52 was because mid-power MFAS was often used in a series of short bouts (Table 2) that were shorter than most deep dives
53 and many shallow dives, but longer than most surface intervals. Overlap with multiple bouts of either MFAS type was
54 very common in the sample of exposed IDDIs due to the typically long duration of these intervals [13], with 131 (54% of
55 total exposed to high-power) including more than one bout of high-power, and 76 (84% of total exposed to mid-power)
more than one bout of mid-power, MFAS use.
56
57 Non-MFAS predictors were included in the best models for all behaviours (Table 4). These included the dive depth when
58 dive duration was the response variable, and duration when depth was the response variable. Position in the deep dive
59 cycle was an important predictor of surface interval duration (surface intervals immediately preceding deep dives were
60 longer than other types), and the duration of the initial deep dive was predictive of the IDDI which followed it (longer

dives tended to be followed by longer intervals). Time of day was included in the best models of all behaviours tested.
Regional variability (by basin) was apparent in the Complete datasets for all behaviours except surface interval. There
1 were no best models that included non-MFAS predictors for one dataset (Complete or SOAR) but not the other. In
2 addition to these factors, at least one MFAS predictor was included in the best model for each response variable. Model
3 selection results are summarized for each response variable and dataset in Table 4, and described below.

5 Deep dive duration
6
7 Deep dives became longer as the distance to the nearest mid-power MFAS decreased. Using the Complete dataset, mean
8 deep dive duration was predicted to increase with proximity to mid-power MFAS from ~60 min to ~90 min beginning at
9 around 40 km (Figure 2A). The SOAR dataset predicted that mean deep dive duration returned to MFAS-free levels by ~
10 20 km, after increasing to ~ 107 min with mid-power MFAS at ~ 5 km (Figure 2B). The second-ranked models added
11 distance to nearest high-power source, with a comparable AIC weight for the Complete dataset (0.224) but a weight
roughly half that of the best model in the SOAR dataset (0.293) (Table 4).
12
13
There were ten deep dives exposed to mid-power MFAS and four exposed to high-power MFAS within 20 km, the
14 distance at which both datasets indicated an increase in deep dive duration with the lower power of the two source types.
15 While ten of these dives were indeed long relative to predicted mean values without MFAS, ranging from a 70.2 min dive
16 with MFAS at 18.5 km to a maximum recorded dive duration of 163.3 min with MFAS at 8.3 km, the remaining four
17 were instead unusually short (39.9, 40.9, 43.0, and 55.6 min). In addition to their brevity, another unusual characteristic
18 of these four deep dives was that they were all shallow relative to the bottom: their maximum depths were more than 500
19 m above the seafloor at the whale's estimated location, whereas previously published data suggested deep dives are
20 typically to or near the bottom in this region [13].
21
22 On SOAR, the best model also predicted that, at a given exposure distance, deep dives become shorter as the amount of
23 overlapping mid-power MFAS (mid-power OL) increased. At the lowest mid-power OL values, mean deep dive duration
24 was predicted to increase by ~ 30 min over confirmed MFAS-free periods, but to fall below MFAS-free values at mid-
power OL values above 0.40 (Figure 2C).
25
26 Shallow Dives
27
28 Using the Complete dataset, shallow dives were predicted increase in duration as the distance to both high- and mid-
29 power MFAS sources decreased, beginning at approximately 100 km. Proximity to mid-power MFAS ultimately
30 increased shallow dive duration slightly more than proximity to high-power MFAS at the closest ranges, though the
31 maximum increase was only several minutes in either case (from ~ 20 min without MFAS to ~ 24 min with mid-power
32 MFAS at close range, Figures 3A and 3B). At a given distance, shallow dives in the Complete data also increased
33 modestly in duration, to ~ 2 min above MFAS-free levels, as high-power MFAS OL decreased (Figure 3C). The best
34 model of shallow dive duration was nearly 8 times more likely than the second-best model (AIC weight = 0.105), which
35 added mid-power MFAS OL to the best model.
36
37 The best model of shallow dive duration on SOAR, where the maximum exposure distances were 51 km and 39 km for
high- and mid-power MFAS, respectively, included a presence/absence effect of MFAS use rather than one with
38
dependence on distance. As with the Complete dataset, mid-power MFAS use increased shallow dive duration slightly
39 more than high-power and to a similar extent (from ~ 19 min in confirmed MFAS-free periods to ~ 24 min with mid-
40 power MFAS), and exposure to both types of MFAS resulted in the longest dives (~ 26 min) (Figure 3D). The best model
41 was five times more likely than the second-best model (AIC weight = 0.144), which added high-power MFAS OL to the
42 best model.
43
44 Shallow dive depth and duration had a very strong positive linear correlation in all the data, where longer shallow dives
45 were almost invariably deeper. That relationship became more variable when MFAS of either type was in use, and tended
46 to flatten, so that the longer dives seen during MFAS use were often shallower than expected for dives of similar duration
47 when MFAS was not in use, particularly for mid-power MFAS (Figures 4A and 4B). This effect was evident in both
48 datasets but most noticeable on SOAR (Figure 4B), where both depth and duration of shallow dives were best explained
49 by a presence/absence MFAS effect (Figure 3D). The full models for shallow dive depth, with MFAS use as a
presence/absence effect, received about twice the weight of the second-ranked models (AIC weights: 0.240 Complete,
50
0.273 SOAR), which both excluded mid-power MFAS OL from the best model.
51
52 The effects of MFAS OL on shallow dive depth were generally subtle. In both the Complete (Figure 4C) and SOAR
53 (Figure 4D) datasets, shallow dives were slightly shallower and decreased in depth as high-power MFAS OL increased,
54 though values were not far outside those seen without MFAS. Shallow dive depth increased slightly as mid-power MFAS
55 OL increased in the Complete dataset (Figure 4E), but the opposite relationship was seen on SOAR (Figure 4F); however,
56 both datasets had wide 95% CIs that largely overlapped with those of MFAS-free periods. This was especially true for
57 mid-power MFAS OL, the one variable that was removed in the second-best models for both datasets.

2 Surface intervals tended to be longer, but also more variable in duration, during either type of MFAS use (Figures 5A and
3 5B). This effect was most apparent on SOAR, where predicted surface time during confirmed MFAS-free periods was
4 brief and constrained to a very narrow interval (Figure 5B), relative to both periods with MFAS use on SOAR and
5 periods with no reported MFAS use in the Complete dataset. In both datasets, high-power MFAS use increased surface
6 interval more than mid-power, particularly on SOAR. The second-ranked models for surface interval, both of which
7 excluded the presence of mid-power MFAS from the best model, received nearly as much AIC weight as the best model
in the Complete dataset (AIC weight = 0.428), but much less support than the best model on SOAR (AIC weight =
8
0.259).

10 Inter-Deep-Dive-Intervals
11
12 The full models for IDDI, with MFAS as a distance-mediated effect, were vastly superior to all competing models, with
13 almost all the AIC weight for both datasets. In the Complete dataset, IDDI became longer with proximity to both types of
14 MFAS beginning at approximately 100 km, reaching ~200 min, double the IDDI without MFAS, at the closest distances
15 (Figures 6A and 6B). The 95% CIs for IDDI in the Complete dataset were narrow, both during exposure to MFAS within
16 100 km, and especially for periods without reported MFAS use.
17
18 While exposure distance was also included in the best models of IDDI on SOAR, the response was much more variable
19 than in the Complete dataset and differed for high- and mid-power MFAS. Mean predicted IDDI during high-power
MFAS use on SOAR ranged from 180 to 200 min, ~50 min longer than during confirmed MFAS-free periods; however,
20
the distance trend was weak, and the 95% CIs were wide and overlapping for both conditions, spanning ~ 300 min with
21
high-power MFAS use and ~ 200 min without (Figure 6C). The 95% CI for IDDI during mid-power MFAS use on SOAR
22 was even wider, reaching a maximum range of nearly 600 min. In contrast to high-power MFAS use, there was a much
23 clearer trend with distance; the mean predicted IDDI during mid-power sonar use on SOAR reached a maximum of ~3.5
24 times the mean IDDI without MFAS with a mid-power source at ~10 km (Figure 6D). Ultimately, IDDI during high-
25 power MFAS on SOAR may have been better explained as a presence/absence effect that increased IDDI similarly across
26 the range of exposure distances that occurred on SOAR. However, because the GAMM required a single effect type be
27 applied to both MFAS types, the strong distance trend associated with mid-power MFAS use favoured the distance-
28 mediated effect in model selection.
29
30 IDDI decreased as OL with both types of MFAS increased in the Complete dataset. Mean predicted IDDI ranged from ~
31 140 min at high-power OL values near zero to ~ 90 min as high-power OL approached one (Figure 7A). Mid-power
32 MFAS OL decreased IDDI from ~ 160 min near zero to ~ 100 min as mid-power OL approached one. However,
estimates for IDDI at mid-power OL above 0.3 had extremely wide confidence intervals, given sparse data (Figure 7B).
33
On SOAR, IDDI also tended to decrease as MFAS OL increased, with values ranging from ~190 min to ~150 min as
34 high-power OL increased from zero to one (Figure 7C), and from ~310 min to ~200 min as mid-power OL increased
35 from zero to 0.3, beyond which there were no data to inform predictions (Figure 7D). MFAS-free values on SOAR
36 centred around ~ 120 min, though all predictions on SOAR had wide and often overlapping confidence intervals,
37 particularly during MFAS use where samples were small.
38
39 The overall mean deep dive cycle (IDDI + preceding deep dive duration) for all whales when no MFAS was reported was
40 175 min (range 33 - 680 min, n = 1647), corresponding to approximately 8 deep dives per day. In the full BL data, there
41 were 37 (1.8% of total) IDDIs longer than 300 min- approximately three times the mean predicted IDDI without MFAS
42 (Figure 6). These IDDIs, ranging from 301 - 641 min, corresponded to an estimated loss of 3 to 6 deep dives, assuming a
43 typical deep dive cycle of 175 min. Seventy percent (26 of 37) of these very long IDDIs included MFAS of one or both
44 types. There were eight whales that each had more than 100 deep dive cycles in the Complete data. These whales
averaged 6% of dive cycles with high-power MFAS within 100 km (range 4-14% per individual), and 4% of dive cycles
45
with mid-power within 100 km (range 1-7% per individual). Dive cycles with MFAS within 20 km, the distance where
46
IDDI generally increased 2 -3 times, though occasionally by a factor of six, were infrequent. They accounted for a
47 maximum of 2% per individual with high-power MFAS, and 3% with mid-power, for these eight whales.

5. Discussion
54 This study analysed a large collection of behavioural data from Cuvier's beaked whales with and without exposure to two
55 common military sonar systems: high-power, hull-mounted, surface ship MFAS and mid-power, helicopter-deployed
56 dipping MFAS. In addition to the time of day, geographic area, and several within-individual behavioural correlates,
57 MFAS variables were included in the best models for every behaviour type tested, both on and off SOAR. Distance-
58 mediated effects that increased with MFAS proximity were evident for some behaviours during MFAS use up to 100 km
59 away. While high-power MFAS was often associated with effects over greater distances than mid-power MFAS,
60 responses to mid-power MFAS were often more pronounced at comparable closer ranges, and presumably at lower

received levels. This also suggests an animal that is exposed at a given receive level from a close mid-power source may
react more strongly than when it is exposed at the same receive level from a high-power source at a greater distance.
1 Deep dives, shallow dives, and surface intervals all tended to become longer as distance to MFAS decreased. In
2 combination these effects contributed to longer intervals between the deep dives that are typically associated with
3 foraging in this species, and thus foraging disruption was likely during and following MFAS use.
4
5 Several previous studies have suggested that beaked whales increase the duration of deep dives in response to high-
6 power, hull-mounted MFAS signal types [8–10]. Distance to high-power MFAS was not included in the best models for
7 deep dive duration, though there were few close-range high-power exposures in the data: only 11 of 214 deep dives
8 exposed to high-power MFAS were within 25 km of the source, and none of these were within 15 km. The previous
9 record for mammalian dive duration (137 min) was from another Cuvier's beaked whale tagged as part of this work in
10 2010 [13]. Comprehensive MFAS use data were not available from 2010, so tags deployed that year were excluded from
11 this analysis; however, a review of the archives around the time when the 137 min dive occurred revealed 45 min of high-
power sonar use in the middle of the dive, ~ 9 km from the whale's predicted location. Thus, very close range exposures
12
to high-power MFAS during deep dives may increase their duration, but the current data were insufficient to detect a
13
trend.
14
15 One possibility is that there were so few high-power MFAS exposures at close ranges because these whales, many of
16 which exhibit high site fidelity to this regularly used MFAS training area [13,17], avoid diving deeply, or perhaps begin
17 to displace, when military surface ships are near. Testing this hypothesis is important because it suggests that not only the
18 use of MFAS, but also other Navy activities that precede or succeed its use may influence the behaviour of these whales.
19 This hypothesis could be evaluated using tag data and ship tracks to compare deep dive and movement rates when
20 military ships were within 15 km but not using their MFAS to behaviour when there were no military ships nearby.
21
22 In contrast, proximity to mid-power MFAS was associated with an increase in deep dive duration in these data, where 16
23 of 45 deep dives that coincided with mid-power MFAS use were within 25 km of the source, with a minimum distance of
24 6 km. The longest deep dive in this study, lasting 163 min, occurred while the whale was intermittently exposed to mid-
power MFAS at distances of 8-12 km. While it may be possible for a whale to avoid conducting a deep dive while a
25
surface ship is nearby, the same is not true for helicopters, which acoustically may appear without warning. Surface ships
26 typically broadcast MFAS for extended periods while moving; thus whales likely know roughly where the ship is when
27 exposure begins and how its position is changing through time, and can use this knowledge to mediate their response.
28 Helicopters deployed MFAS from a hover in bouts generally lasting under twenty minutes, moving rapidly between
29 sequential deployments in an unpredictable pattern, and thus whales may react more strongly to these sudden, close-range
30 exposures even though their duration of use and source level (217 dB) are generally well below those of a ship's MFAS
31 (235 dB) [23]. The difference in these responses underscores the importance of how the source is used, in addition to
32 sound levels (source or received) and distance, in predicting whale behaviour, particularly for whales that are likely
33 familiar with both MFAS types.
34
35 While the behavioural records used in this analysis did not provide a detailed record of precisely where in the water
36 column a whale was at a given time, abruptly surfacing from either deep or shallow dives, which would have presumably
37 led to shorter than expected dive durations, did not appear to be a typical response to MFAS for these whales. While
unusually short deep dives did occasionally occur during MFAS use, they were much less common. These deep dives
38
were also unusual in that they were shallow relative to local bottom depth, suggesting they did not reach primary foraging
39 habitat in this region, where deep dives typically approached the seafloor [13], rather than that they were aborted after
40 reaching typical foraging depth. Assuming whales may alter their behaviour during MFAS in part to reduce the intensity
41 of the sound they are exposed to and that sound levels are likely to be higher near the surface, particularly at close range,
42 remaining at depth as long as possible when already near the bottom, remaining mid-water if exposed on deep-dive
43 descent, or conducting unusually deep non-foraging dives may all help reduce sound exposure, and may explain why both
44 deep and shallow dives typically increased in length with MFAS proximity.
45
46 There may be limits to the extent whales use depth to mitigate exposure, however. In the absence of MFAS, shallow dive
47 duration and depth were related with almost no variability, i.e. unusually long shallow dives were also unusually deep.
48 But as shallow dives became longer during MFAS use, they did not become commensurately deeper, and were still much
49 shorter and shallower than typical deep dives without MFAS. This pattern, coupled with the tendency for IDDI to
increase during MFAS use, suggests that it is unlikely that whales exposed to MFAS during a shallow dive routinely
50
"switched" to a deep dive (i.e. descended deep enough for long enough for the dive to have been statistically classified as
51
a deep dive for that individual). Schorr et al. [13] noted significant differences in the duration of surface intervals based
52 on when they occurred in the deep dive cycle: the final surfacing just prior to each deep dive was significantly longer than
53 surface intervals that separate shallow dives. This effect, also apparent in the inclusion of the Surface Sequence predictor
54 in the best model of surface interval duration here (Table 4), suggests whales need this extra 1-2 minutes of surface time
55 to prepare for deep dives, and that they cannot necessarily shift from shallow to deep diving once a dive has commenced.
56 It is also possible that whales use longer, but not deeper, shallow dives during MFAS use to displace horizontally, rather
57 than vertically, to mitigate sound exposure. This may be supported by the finding that shallow dives that occur during
58 prolonged high-power MFAS use (with high-power OL at or near 1) tend to be shallower than shallow dives without
59 MFAS (Figures 4C and 4D). The use of modelled location data for these tags, with a minimum possible time step of 30
60 minutes, and coarse MFAS positions, precluded the inclusion of displacement metrics in the behavioural models used

2 here. However, an independent analysis of displacement as a function of MFAS use could provide some insight into the
3 role horizontal displacement plays in response, particularly if paired with the higher-resolution MFAS movement data
4 that is available for many operations on SOAR. While this is possible using the modelled spatial data, improved satellite
5 tag technology with high-resolution, GPS-derived movements, would provide a more robust means of studying
6 displacement during exposure, and potentially allow for both vertical and horizontal movements to be modelled
7 simultaneously.
8
Increased dive durations may drive the increased surface intervals also seen during MFAS use. A surface interval effect
9 was most evident on SOAR, where night-time mean surface time more than doubled from approximately three to over six
10 minutes when both types of MFAS were active, though increases during only one type were more modest, at roughly two
11 minutes for high-power and one minute for mid-power MFAS. During MFAS use, and even following the most extreme
12 deep dives, whales appeared to conduct more of these modestly longer surface intervals, contributing to extended IDDIs,
13 rather than to dramatically extend a single surface interval. While long surface intervals were uncommon in all the data,
14 they were occasionally seen, particularly at night when MFAS was not in use. Also, back-to-back deep dives, which were
15 typically separated by a single very long surface interval (median duration = 46.4 min, range 1.3 - 115.7 min), were
16 observed on 56 occasions without MFAS, but this pattern was observed only once when MFAS of either type was active
17 within 100 km, with the intervening surface interval lasting just over 5 min. This may suggest that whales increase
18 surface time only as much as is necessary while MFAS is in use, a response that may mitigate sound exposure at closer
19 ranges. Avoiding prolonged surface intervals, even when they might be physiologically advantageous (e.g. to support the
oxygen demands of prolonged dives, with or without increased displacement) also lends support to the risk-disturbance
20
hypothesis, which suggests whales may respond to MFAS in a manner that is shaped by a species-specific anti-predator
21
strategy, which for beaked whales likely involves escape through deep and prolonged diving [32].
22
23 Another noteworthy prediction of the surface interval models was that these whales appeared to consistently conduct
24 much shorter surface intervals during confirmed MFAS-free periods on SOAR than during periods without reported
25 MFAS use in the Complete dataset. This was despite that geographic area (which was a broader classification than
26 SOAR) was not selected as a predictor of surface interval in the best model of the Complete dataset. While there may be
27 other naturally-occurring factors not accounted for in this model that affect surface interval, one possibility is that whales
28 routinely limit their surface time on SOAR to avoid increased vessel traffic or other noise-generating, surface-based
29 operations that also occur there regularly [19]. These include explosions and small arms fire, both of which could
30 potentially be detected in the hydrophone archive, and thus their effect on whale behaviour could potentially be assessed
31 using this method.
32
The tendency for deep and shallow dives in some models, and IDDI in all models, to become shorter as the amount of
33
overlapping MFAS (OL) increased is at least partly explained by the fact that these behaviours tend to become longer
34 during exposure but the durations of MFAS bouts are fairly consistent and independent of the whales’ behaviours; thus
35 the relationship between these factors tends to be inverse. Inaccurate reporting in SPORTS, which included eight MFAS
36 bouts that were improbably long (800 - 1440 min) but for which the actual duration could not be verified, could also have
37 created behaviours with high OL values that occurred when MFAS was no longer active, artificially reducing the
38 apparent effect of high OL values in the Complete dataset. However, these inaccurate records represented a small
39 proportion of the total data, and MFAS OL was also included in several of the best models on SOAR, where there were
40 no unusually long, unverified bouts of use, reducing the likelihood that inaccurate reporting was a primary driver of these
41 results. It is possible that whales alter their behaviour most strongly when MFAS use first commences or is being used
42 intermittently, increasing the likelihood of a startle response [33]; both are cases where OL is less than 1, contributing to
43 this effect.
44
While the same inherent inverse relationship between behavioural event duration and MFAS bout duration also
45
contributed to an association between unusually short behaviours and high MFAS OL values, there is likely a real
46
underlying response pattern reflected in this relationship, as well. For example, a review of ten unusually short deep dives
47 that occurred during mid-power MFAS use on SOAR revealed that in seven of them, ranging in distance from 11-30 km
48 to the source, the whale exhibited the aforementioned unusual pattern of descending to lower mid-water (ranging from
49 63- 79% of local bottom depth) rather than to typical foraging habitat near the bottom. In all of these cases, the dive either
50 commenced just after MFAS onset, and thus may have been a vertical avoidance response rather than a true foraging
51 attempt, or MFAS commenced shortly after the whale left the surface, and the whale may have aborted a would-be
52 foraging attempt before reaching the bottom; in all cases, MFAS OL values were at or near one, with MFAS starting early
53 and continuing intermittently through all or most of the ensuing truncated deep dive. Six of these ten unusually short deep
54 dives during MFAS were conducted by the same whale, suggesting some individuals may favour a response that is not
55 typical of the larger population, and highlighting the importance of considering individual variation when characterizing
56 responses.
57
The other behaviour that became unusually short at high OL values was the IDDI during high-power MFAS use in the
58
Complete dataset. A review of 13 unusually short IDDIs (< 90 min) with MFAS OL above 0.8 revealed two interesting
59 patterns. Five were truncated by the unusually short, mid-water deep dives occasionally seen during MFAS use, and thus
60 were likely the counterpart of that less-common deep dive response rather than a true shorter-than-usual foraging cycle; if

so, the two IDDIs separated by these aberrant deep dives could likely be summed into a single extended IDDI. Three
other of these short IDDIs followed unusually long exposed IDDIs, and may represent an increase in foraging rate
1 following the initial, more typical, response, despite that MFAS was still in use. Because the MFAS data used in this
2 analysis provided only the position of the source when transmission began, ships could move considerable distances
3 during prolonged exercises, and if the ship moves away or does not come closer, whales may well resume foraging at, or
4 even above, MFAS-free rates while the source is still active, creating unusually short IDDIs with high MFAS OL. These
5 examples provide two potential mechanisms by which extended use of MFAS could be associated with an apparent
6 reduction in IDDI, as these models suggest.
7
8 Response patterns in deep dives and IDDI associated with MFAS OL help interpret some of the high variability seen in
9 the predictions on SOAR, particularly for IDDI, where sample sizes were much smaller. They also underscore the value
10 of coupling passive acoustic vocal data with dive records from these tags in the future to determine whether a given deep
11 dive was actually associated with evidence of foraging activity near the whale’s location. M3R detection archives have
already been used to derive a risk function for MFAS-associated foraging disruption for Blainville's beaked whales at
12
AUTEC [14]; they could also be used to identify deep dives in this dataset that occurred without echolocation clicks on
13
nearby hydrophones to refine the approach here. The use of extended-duration tags with acoustic recording capability,
14 currently under development, could provide vocalization data from the tagged whale itself, and would be the best way to
15 verify foraging activity during deep dives in the future.

18 6. Conclusion
19
20 Exposure to both high- and mid-power military MFAS systems was associated with a variety of behavioural changes in
21 satellite-tagged Cuvier's beaked whales in Southern California. Responses that increased with proximity were evident up
to 100 km away in this large dataset that included sizeable samples of behaviour from 16 whales both with and without
22
MFAS use, despite the relative coarseness of both the behavioural and MFAS data used in this analysis. Responses were
23
often more pronounced for mid-power rather than high-power MFAS at comparable close distances even though received
24 levels- the metric by which effects are currently estimated for permitting purposes [19,34]- were likely considerably
25 lower for mid-power MFAS. With other behavioural predictors taken into account (including time of day, region, and
26 individual behavioural patterns), deep dives, shallow dives, and surface bouts all tended to increase in duration during
27 MFAS use. Variability in predictions was likely associated with how the source was used (continuous vs. intermittent
28 transmission bouts), the relative timing and duration of MFAS use (onset prior to, early, or late in the behaviour; initial or
29 prolonged use), and in some cases may reflect individual behavioural preferences. A detailed review of specific responses
30 within these data that do not follow predicted patterns, particularly on SOAR, where detailed platform geometry can be
31 recreated and ping-by-ping sound fields modelled, may provide additional insight into circumstances that enhance or
32 reduce responsiveness.
33
34 Exposure to MFAS within 100 km at any point in the deep dive cycle was associated with an increased IDDI, a proxy for
foraging disruption in this species. Increased IDDI is the response most likely to have long-term fitness consequences if
35
exposures happen frequently, though these data suggest that exposures associated with the greatest increases in IDDI are
36 relatively uncommon. The relative strength of the increased IDDI response (i.e. that models of IDDI including MFAS
37 variables were so superior to models without them), which could also potentially be documented through changes in
38 vocal activity in the archive [7], supports the continued use of foraging disruption in Population Consequences of
39 Disturbance models being developed for this and other beaked whale populations on sonar training ranges [14,16].
40 However, given that 30% of extremely long IDDIs did not coincide with reported high- or mid-power MFAS use (three
41 of which were confirmed free of MFAS), there are likely to be other factors not included in this analysis that can
42 significantly extend the deep dive cycle. An attempt should be made to identify if any of these long cycles were
43 potentially associated with other anthropogenic activities through a review of operational schedules and the archive.
44 Benthic prey data, which is difficult to collect at the depths these whales typically forage, would also greatly improve our
45 understanding of the deep dive cycle in this species.
46
47 None of the whales tagged in this study, who have likely been previously exposed to MFAS, stranded or closely
approached land, despite some exposures at just a few kilometres distance. They have, however, further expanded our
48
understanding of the behavioural extremes this species is capable of. Data from this work could form the basis of a
49 comparative behavioural study with whales from regions where MFAS is not used and whales from regions where
50 MFAS-associated stranding events have occurred, to identify any fundamental differences that might predispose whales
51 elsewhere to harm.

13
14 Table 4. Predictors included in the best models by response variable and dataset. 'High' represents high-power MFAS
15 sources, and 'Mid' mid-power sources. 'Dist' is the distance from the whale to the nearest source of that type, 'Pres' is the
16 presence/absence of the source type at any distance, and 'OL' is the proportion of the behaviour that overlapped with
17 MFAS use of the type. AIC weight of the best model is provided (second best models and their weights are discussed in
18 text). A '+' symbol means the predictor was included in the best fit model, '-' means the predictor was a candidate but not
included in the best model, and a shaded box means the predictor was not a candidate for that response variable. *This is

CI for the relationship between depth and duration without MFAS ("None" in A and B) is so narrow it is barely visible.
45 Panels C through F show the effect of MFAS OL on shallow dive depth as follows: high-power MFAS OL in the
46 Complete (C) and SOAR (D) datasets, mid-power MFAS OL in the Complete (E) and SOAR (F) datasets. In all plots,
47 solid black lines/dots represent mean predicted values with shaded areas/error bars representing the 95% CI; hash marks

ments to the Author(s)
is a relatively well written paper presenting valuable results and insights from the analysis of a relatively
-term, large-scale data set based on tagged Cuvier’s beaked whales in the Southern California Bight in
onse to U.S. Navy mid-frequency sonar.
y of my edits and comments (n=31) are minor grammatical edits that do not effect the fundamentals of the
uscript. These could be readily resolved by careful reading and editing by several of the multiple authors.
summary is very readable and does not overstate the results.
ne goes deeper I think there’s an important message in here, but it is not so easy to distill. The data are
er readily visible to the reader except through many paragraphs that require multiple levels of explanation,
ch describe data pruning, data exceptions etc. Thus, for example, it would be valuable for a reader if there
a figure showing a time line and some associated time-varying data. This would increase a reader’s
reciation for the extent of the data and the distances from MFAS over which dive data were available. In the
res this gets lost.
have added, as Supplementary Material, a continuous dive trace from one whale lasting nearly 10 days
sonar use, by type and nearest source, indicated. The trace includes an extended period with no sonar
followed by numerous exposures of both sonar types across a range of distances.
ough I do not consider myself qualified to provide expert opinion in the GAM statistical processes that were
lied, my interpretation is that the authors were very thorough in their analyses and stayed on course in their
rpretations of their analytical results.
discussion is thorough. The conclusion was adequate, and mostly seemed like a rewording of previous text
g with the usual “what could we do in the future” fluff. The final paragraph was a disappointment and just
of fell off the back of the chair. What the authors need to do is focus their collective minds on the project
results, do some serious thinking out of the limitation of this sand box and imagine what this implies for
e remarkable animals: animals that spend most of their lives hunting in darkness at depths and for
tions that are nearly impossible for humans to comprehend. That would be the context in which to write a
cendo for this remarkable piece of work, which not so long ago would have seemed impossible.
ember, this research and all the efforts supporting it, were not undertaken to enable this publication, they
e, after all, undertaken to discover, inform and enable wise decisions in support of marine life.
have substantially revised the concluding paragraph, which read:
e of the whales tagged in this study, who have likely been previously exposed to MFAS, stranded or closely
oached land, despite some exposures at just a few kilometres distance. They have, however, further expanded
understanding of the behavioural extremes this species is capable of. Data from this work could form the basis
comparative behavioural study with whales from regions where MFAS is not used and whales from regions
re MFAS-associated stranding events have occurred, to identify any fundamental differences that might
ispose whales elsewhere to harm.
ollows:
initial impetus to study the behaviour of beaked whales exposed to MFAS has been to understand the
hanism underlying sonar-associated stranding events, in hopes of mitigating against them in the future. There
e been no documented sonar-associated mass stranding events in southern California [8], and while this does not
ssarily mean they have never occurred, particularly given the long history of sonar use and the low odds of
cting a stranding in this offshore area [37], none of the whales tagged in this study stranded or closely
oached land despite some exposures estimated at just a few kilometres distance. While some responses
eded the behavioural extremes previously established for this species [14,16], the whales went on to resume
arently normal diving patterns until the next time they were exposed. Thus, the primary impacts of MFAS use on
sonar-savvy population are likely to be cumulative, rather than acute, in nature. Ultimately, these data did not
ide conclusive evidence of how MFAS causes whales to strand, but rather many examples of sonar-associated
avioural changes that did not, potentially helping to narrow the focus of future studies. While this study has yet
nmask the causal mechanism behind MFAS-related stranding events, it does suggest that responses are
icated on more than just received levels, and that an animal’s familiarity with these sources may mediate its
onsiveness.
e details:
e 2, Line 42: Methods: Somewhere in the methods, it would be very valuable to include a spectrogram
re showing an actual example of the MFAS types and a sonar “bout”. As it is now, the reader has no idea
t an actual MFAS exposure scenario would look like.
ectrogram of a simulated MFAS signal is now provided as Supplementary Material. Further we expanded
explanation of MFAS signals at two points in the section regarding archive processing, to better
racterize how signals are used. First, we added the following after the semicolon:
MFAS detector created a record for any signal with a duration longer than 1 second within the MFAS frequency
ds; the actual signals transmitted during MFAS operations are not fixed, but are selected based on daily
ditions and the objective of the operation (Figure S2).
n, later in the same paragraph we added the parenthetical to describe the typical ping interval:
refore, distinct, high-level pings were detected at regular intervals (usually every 20-30 sec) consistent with
cal MFAS transmissions.
e 3, Line 15: It would be good to define what is meant by a "bout".
original text:
RTS contains bouts of summarized sonar use from throughout the broad SOCAL operating area, which include
start time, start latitude and longitude, end time, and sonar type.
revised text:
RTS contains reports of sonar use from throughout the broad SOCAL operating area that are summarized into
ods during which a sonar signal is repeatedly broadcast from a single platform at regular intervals (hereafter
uts”). Each SPORTS report included the start time, start latitude and longitude, end time, and sonar source type.
e 4, Lines 13-14: Relatively wide (i.e. generous) levels of uncertainty.
se broad intervals were used to identify all potential duplicate bouts in the two sonar data sources, including
e that were subject to spatial or temporal uncertainty in the archive (primarily off-SOAR automated
ctions that were not manually reviewed) and in SPORTS (e.g. due to manual recording or transcription
rs, rounding of numbers, decision to “lump” or “split” sequential bouts occurring in rapid succession). Hull-
nted sonar is somewhat directional, so the received level from a ship that is transmitting outside SOAR
vary as the ship turns toward or away from the range. The detector may parse a continuous transmission
od (that would appear in SPORTS as such) into multiple bouts with discreet starting times and locations as
signal changes, and the farther the ship was from SOAR the less precise the location estimates in the
ive become. Thus we found it necessary to manually review any cases where both the archive and
RTS reported use in the same general area around the same time.
e 4, Line 14: What defines "good temporal and spatial agreement"?
ause we were dealing with multiple sources of uncertainty in both SPORTS and the archive, we were
ble to find clear criteria for identifying duplicate bouts that worked in all cases, so we used total available
ence to determine the likelihood that two bouts were actually the same transmission characterized
rently in each data source. We acknowledge the process introduced some subjectivity into the
nciliation, though the cases that fell into truly gray areas represented a small portion of the total data (15
ts in the archive totalling 75 minutes) and were only included in the larger Complete dataset, where
curacy in the sonar data would have less impact on the analysis.
larify this vague wording in lines 13-14, without adding the previous in-depth explanation, we have revised
original text:
bouts of the same sonar type that differed by less than 15 minutes in any time metric and started within 10 km
ach other were identified as potential duplicates, and manually reviewed. Those bouts with good temporal and
ial agreement in multiple metrics between the two data sources were identified as likely duplicate records.
ollows:
bouts of the same sonar type that differed by less than 15 minutes in any time metric (start time, end time, or
tion of use) and started within 10 km of each other were identified as potential duplicates; wide intervals were
to capture any cases where variable detection in the archive or reporting in SPORTS (e.g. “lumping” versus
itting” sequential bouts in rapid succession in one data source or the other) may have made the same sonar use
ear different between the two sources. The relative timing and positions of the overlapping bouts, along with
e immediately preceding and following them, were manually reviewed. Where the total available data suggested
y duplication between the data sources, a single record of the bout was retained from the archive if on SOAR
from SPORTS if not.
e 4, Line 20: This means no sonar within the range, but not sonar that was off-range?
rect. It means that while there could have been sonar use off range during the period, it was not detectable
he range hydrophones. To clarify this, we have revised the original text:
so explicitly included all spans of time when SOAR was confirmed to be free of high- or mid-power MFAS.
ead:
so explicitly included all spans of time when neither high- nor mid-power MFAS was detected on SOAR,
gh records of concurrent off-SOAR use reported in SPORTS during these periods were retained.

e 4, Line 44: What's a "small number"?
sample sizes were added to this section, and “small” was qualified with “relatively”:

e 4, Line 50: Insert "SOAR" after “outside”?

e 5, Line 5: Something missing here. Should this read: "likely to include gaps."?
original text, which read:
I observations were weighted (by IDDI divided by minimum IDDI) to account for a bias toward shorter
rvals created by gaps in the BL, since intervals that included missing data were excluded from the IDDI dataset,
long intervals were likely include gaps.
s revised as follows:
I observations were weighted (by IDDI divided by minimum IDDI) to account for a bias toward shorter
rvals created by gaps in the BL. Intervals that included gaps (i.e. where one or more Argos messages were not
vered, and thus behaviour during the period was not documented) were excluded from the IDDI dataset; long
rvals were more likely to include gaps, and thus be excluded.

rected.
e 5, Line 46: Would read better if "of" was "for"?
re are two instances of the word “of” in this line, and we were not certain if this comment referred to one,

rected.
e 5, Line 60: Maybe try to reduce ambiguity by reducing the use of pronouns and increasing the use of
ns: so edit to read "... of the IDDI that followed the deep dive..." ??
took this suggestion, though found the sentence read better revised as follows instead:

wed by longer intervals)

rected.
e 8, Line 20: Comma before "but".
rected, though we also added a comma after MFAS to complete this change.
e 8, Line 27: It's not clear what "and how its position is changing through time" means here. Why not say
d how the ship's position is changing through time"?
rected.
e 8, Lines 31-33: So the operational protocol for a particular MFAS could be referred to as an MFAS
rational context, and thus an analog to an animal's behavioral-ecological context?
haps- though, as mentioned, there can be quite a lot of variability in exactly how MFAS sources are used.
e 8, Lines 57-60: But there is no attempt to estimate exposure levels other than very simple metrics. Why
iscussion on this aspect of the diving animal's actual experience? Or maybe this was really unrealistic
ause of the coarseness of the tag data?
extent to which we should discuss estimated received levels was heavily debated amongst the coauthors.
r to conducting this large-scale, aggregate analysis, our effort was primarily focused on modeling received
ls associated with specific exposures. This approach (which we are continuing to pursue) is limited to a
set of the data included here, where both the animal and sonar are on SOAR, the archive was recording,
vessel tracks for all the participants in the exercise and a sound velocity profile were available, and the
mal’s position could be estimated with narrow enough confidence intervals to be meaningful across the
scale of the sonar operation. Using the Navy’s own models, the sound modelling process is laborious and
resulting datasets are enormous, since RL varies, sometimes considerably, across time and three-
ensional space, even when there is just a single sonar in use. Knowing this, we paused to look at all the
mal and sonar data on a very coarse scale and ask the simpler question: to what extent does behavior
elate with exposure distance, regardless of all the other factors that influence RL? The US Navy is, in fact,
easingly interested in distance and context related effects, rather than focusing almost exclusively on the
cts of RL.
yes, the data used here, particularly the very coarse sonar data, precluded anything more than very rough
mates of RL for each source type. An analysis of the role of RL will be conducted separately.
e 9, Lines 25-26: This sentence is unclear: "This was despite that geographic area..."???
, this was poorly written. We revised the original text:
was despite that geographic area (which was a broader classification than SOAR) was not selected as a
ictor of surface interval in the best model of the Complete dataset.
nstead read:
stark difference in presumed MFAS-free surface behaviour was surprising, because geographic area was not
cted as a predictor of surface interval in the best model of the Complete dataset, suggesting the behaviour change
associated with the range itself, and not the basin in which SOAR is located.
e 10, Line 21: Don't you want to refer to the area as the Southern California Bight? Southern California is
ain not marine.
, corrected.
e 10, Lines 21-23: The whales did not use MFAS. Better to use "during": "... 16 whales during periods with
without MFAS, ...."
rected.
e 10, Lines 47-51: This paragraph is disappointing and not an appropriately strong ending to this important
y. It needs to be rewritten, please. The first sentence is okay. The second is awkward and oblique. The third
last is predictable, unnecessarily convoluted and off-target from the major import of this study ("predispose
les elsewhere to harm"! Huh?)
se see the revisions to this paragraph beginning at the end of page 1 of this document.
e 11, Lines 24-25: The initials here, which include a middle initial, don't match the names in the list of
ors, which do not include a middle initial. Important?
dle initials were removed from the Funding Statement, Competing Interests, and Authors’ Contributions
ions to follow the example provided by the journal online.
e 17, Table 1 caption: Delete comma after "summary". Why "by" and not "per" or "for each"?
rected to “for each”, and comma removed.
e 17, Table 2 caption: Table headings are not clear. What does "Bouts of use" mean: the bout sample
? What does "Median Bout Dur (Range) (min)" mean? Why is "Range" in caps? Does "min" mean minimum
inute? Maybe explain table terms in the caption so that one can read the caption and view the table without
culty understanding terms?
eral changes were made to the table itself: “High” and “Mid” were changed to High-power and Mid-power,
uts of use” was changed to “Number of bouts”, “(min)” meant minutes in the bout duration header (very
fusing) so it was removed from the header and added to the table caption instead. The caption was further

AS type, and location.
e 17, Figure 2: When the term OL is used in a figure axis label, the axis goes from 0 to 1, but for a reader
is incomplete. Either in a caption for a figure or in the figure there needs to be some way for the reader to
w or remember what a value for OL means.
he first occurrence of the term “OL” in each figure caption where it was used, we added the following by way
xplanation:

for example, the caption for Figure 2 now begins:

e 17, Figure 4: The titles at the tops of the "A" and "B" figures, "MFAS in Operation", are confusing because
of its four panels is labeled "None", which means that the MFAS was NOT in operation. Wouldn't it be

, because the panel contents are so small, there is no really obvious difference between the model results
he different conditions. For example, one has to study them with squinting eyes to see that the slopes are
rent. Since these figure results are pretty central to the main messages of the paper, it would really help
cause to make them easier to look at and decipher.
titles were changed as suggested. Figure 4 has been separated into two separate figures, with A and B
rescaled to each fill half a page, given the subtle effects they depict.

ments to the Author(s)
is a very interesting study with a quite unique dataset. Other than minor comments and suggested edits
uded in the attached pdf version of the manuscript, I see three important points to consider in the revision:
seems the fact that these extreme deep divers need to cope with nitrogen supersaturation is not
sidered in the interpretation of results and potential negative effects by behavioural responses to MFAS.
discussion seems to be centered around oxygen demands of prolonged dives and hypoxia recovery after
p long dives, but equally or more important is the need for release of high nitrogen concentration in blood
out entering into decompression sickness. Even if this subject is still a topic of active debate within the
lysis of mass strandings related to MFAS, this manuscript does not even mention this physiological
ation and its role in shaping the diving and surfacing behavior of this species. I would encourage to make
ffort to integrate this topic into the discussion. See my comments in some discussion sections where this
ect is really needed. The data and results you have are quite unique to address this subject.
have avoided delving deeply into a discussion of physiology primarily because the gas exchange, and thus
etiology of DCS-like syndrome, in these whales remains so poorly understood. Further, while these do
esent unique data for this species, they lack resolution in the specific elements of the dive currently
eved most likely to influence DCS risk (e.g. ascent/descent rates, time at specific depths within each dive,
fine-scale displacement/swim speed). Essentially, the more we learn about these animals, the more we
ize they deal with dissolved gasses in a way that we do not understand. Given the length and complexity of
study to simply document the circumstances of when and how behavior changes as a function of sonar
osure, we felt a detailed treatment of the physiological implications of these changes was beyond the scope
is manuscript.
here is no mention of beaked whale population structure or seasonality in the study region, but some
ements suggest the tagged whales might well be long-term residents in the SOAR. This could lead to
ituation, sensitization, and other exposure related effects that might alter the type and degree of
avioural responses to MFAS ensonification. Because the aim of the study was to document and quantify
e responses, one would expect this manuscript to discuss how these population characteristics could
ain differences within the results and between the results presented here and the ones described in other
ons where beaked whales and sonar exposures have been studied.
have underscored at several points in the manuscript that these whales exhibit high site fidelity to this
on, and they are likely very familiar with MFAS use and not subject to acute effects seen elsewhere. These
detailed as they come up in specific responses, below.
ven if the aim of the study was to determine whether MFAS use was associated with behavioural changes
is species, some sections (abstract, introduction) spin the text towards a more analytical study to improve
understanding on the potential negative effects of MFAS in this species. The manuscript presents clear
ng and surfacing responses to MFAS exposure, but barely relates these documented responses to potential
ative effects. The increased inter-deep-dive-interval is presented as a proxy for foraging disruption, but the
ussion stops there. This subject should be expanded, and not just to IDDI results. This is of particular
ortance in an area where MFAS is recurrently used and where beaked whales might well be chronically
osed to this acoustic disturbance.
er than these 3 points and other minor comments in the attached pdf, the study is quite impressive and I
gratulate the authors for their contribution worth publishing in this journal.
ponses to specific comments in the pdf:
: This study limits the behaviour to depth and time based information. By using "behavioural reponses" the
it suggests a more complete and detailed behavioural dataset is used. I suggest replacing by "diving
aviour responses..."
have revised the title to: Diving behavior of Cuvier's beaked whales exposed to two types of military sonar
e 1, Line 51: This statement is misleading, there are several publications showing how dive profile
uption cause gas and fat embolism leading to death. See Fernandez et al. and Jepson et al. papers on this
ect.
nandez et al. and Jepson et al. both detail the pathological findings from necropsies of whales that have
nded and died following exposure to military sonar, which include the first observations of “decompression-
sickness” described in marine mammals. Both papers suggested two possible causative mechanisms for in
bubble formation and growth: that the sound itself directly encourages bubble formation in tissues that are
er-saturated in nitrogen (rectified diffusion), or that sonar elicits a behavior change (e.g. rapid ascent, as is
case for DCS in humans) that encourages bubble growth through passive diffusion. Saunders et al. (2010)
uced a technical report summarizing the likelihood of these two mechanism, and concluded that
aviourally-mediated passive diffusion was much more likely to underpin the syndrome observed, and since
time most research has focused on behavioural response. Fahlman et al (2014) modeled gas exchange in
p divers and offered several potential explanations of how behavioral responses could lead to DCS. But if
of these are actually occurring is not known. This is due in part to a lack of data on behavioral changes
ng actual sonar use (sample sizes in all previous studies have been small and mostly during simulated
ar use that may not approximate real sonar use well), coupled with our limited understanding of gas
hange physiology in extremely deep divers.
had actually included a rather lengthy treatise on the understanding of acute mortality in association with
ar exposure in early drafts of this manuscript, but ultimately decided to exclude it, given the length and
plexity of the paper, and the limitations of our data (very coarse dive metrics without ascent and descent
s) to adequately address this topic. We have, in fact, provided these data to physiologists to assess their
y in improving our understanding of gas exchange in beaked whales. However, this has not proven
ightforward and constitutes a paper unto itself.
ever, to address this comment, we have revised the statement in question:
pite mounting public concern and considerable research in the years since these stranding events were first

cies in this region?
re has been only one previous sonar response study in this region (DeRuiter et al. 2013); it
marized responses of two whales to a playback of a simulated sound source. No substantive work
been done with real sonar sources. With respect to population status, like most beaked whale photo-
tudies to date, our data suggest these whales form a fairly localized population. However, these data
not published. To clarify these points, we changed the statement:

ence and absence of two commonly used MFAS systems.

e 3, Line 22: Can the authors provide a sense of how often this happened? what was the proportion or
ent of reports suspect to error?
ut this simply, and honestly- not easily. We have struggled with how to represent SPORTS without
wing its utility into question. Because there was no pre-existing standard for “typical” sonar use to
pare records against, it was difficult to identify what was a potential error and what was normal
ation in usage.
have decided to make several revisions to improve this section. First, we have reversed the order in
ch the two sonar data sources are described, the three paragraphs explaining how sonar use was
ved from the M3R archives first, then the paragraph explaining SPORTS. This way we can use the
hive detections as an independent standard to compare SPORTS against.
t, we have expanded our original statement regarding suspect records in SPORTS:
pect reports (e.g. unusual locations, durations, or movements when subsequent reports were known to come from
same platform) were provided to SPORTS data managers and corrected when possible, though in some cases no
ous correction was provided. These records were retained as reported.
ollows:
pect reports (e.g. unusual locations, durations, or movements when subsequent reports were known to come from
same platform) were provided to SPORTS data managers and corrected at their direction when possible. In the
l SPORTS dataset, 22% of high-power MFAS use records, and 15% of mid-power MFAS use records, were
er than the longest bouts for each type detected in the archives on SOAR, including 15 records that reported
r use for 24 hours or more. While some of these records may have over-reported actual usage, under-reporting
AS use was presumably also possible, but not readily detectable. Ultimately SPORTS represented the best
lable record of MFAS use outside SOAR, even though inaccurate reporting could reduce the apparent effect of
osure in this analysis (e.g. unexposed behaviours could be falsely associated with MFAS use and exposed
aviours could be included in MFAS-free data).
e 3, Line 30: Was there any other possible source of sonar other than high and mid-power MFAS? Could
nations co-occurring during the naval exercises bias the interpretation of results?
oted in the introduction (page 2, line 29) there are many potential sources of anthropogenic sound
d by the military in this region, ranging from less powerful sonar sources to explosives (an expansive
is provided in the referenced EIS for the SOCAL range). Given the specific interest in the more
erful sonar sources that have been associated with stranding events elsewhere, and the logistic
r-impossibility of characterizing the entire soundscape across the spatial and temporal scope of these
s, we focused this analysis exclusively on the presence and absence of high- and mid-power MFAS,
we think this is clear. It is certainly possible that other sound sources (and other ecological factors)

did not want to alternately choose starting versus ending positions for dives because response could
ct displacement rates. So we always used the start position, regardless of whether sonar onset was
ore or during the dive itself. As an aside, our on-water tracking data suggest the average
lacement between surface intervals is 0.7 km, which is well within the 95% CI around the estimated
le locations (which averaged 12 km), and small relative to the distances across which responses were
erved- so calculating distance off the start versus end positions was unlikely to affect results.

having a hard time understanding this approach, it was stated in the above paragraph that any source
in 10 km or within 15 minutes apart is considered a duplicate. How can a single platform transmitting
uentially or separated platforms less than 10 km away will be identified and not considered a duplicate?
t, as clarified above, sources transmitting within 10 km and 15 min apart were not automatically
sidered duplicates, they were flagged for manual screening and only reconciled if there was strong
ence to do so. However, even after this was done, there were still a subset of cases where multiple
forms were active during a single behavioral event (the numbers of which are detailed in the second
agraph of the results, so that the reader is aware of the degree to which data were consolidated). We
nt a considerable amount of time deciding how to characterize what can sometimes be very complex
rations into a set of concise variables that were appropriate for this analytical approach. We
mately settled on distance to the nearest platform vs presence/absence (allowing model selection to
ermine which fit the data best) and the total amount of sonar that was in use during the event.
e 5, Line 37: I don't think this was described in the methods section. Please describe how was the manual
ew made.
following paragraph was added to the Methods section to explain manual screening of automated
ection:
positive sonar detections from 2012 and 2014, and portions of detections from 2011 and 2015 where the output
cated multiple sources were present, were manually reviewed. No false positive detections were identified after
earlier filtering steps described above. To estimate the false negative rate, periods with no sonar detections in the
mated detector output were randomly selected and manually reviewed. Any periods where sonar was visually
on a spectrogram of the hard-limited binary frequency bin data were noted and corrected in the data.
e 5, Line 38: How is this relevant to the rate of false absence?
following sentences were revised/added to the results to clarify the false negative rate and its
ses:
b-set of 122 of these periods identified by the automated sonar detector (983.4 hrs total, with 257 hours from
1, 492 hours from 2012, 118 hours from 2014, and 115 hours from 2015), were manually reviewed for false
ative detections. In 2011, MFAS of either type was detected on SOAR in manual review during 5.45% of time
the detector classified as MFAS-free. In subsequent years the false negative rate was reduced to 0.46%. Most
e negatives resulted from one or two pings at the beginning of a successfully detected bout that were missed (and
the length of the bout increased slightly), or cases where the sonar had used parameters different from those that
e used to set the detector. Additionally, the automatic gain control settings on the hydrophones in operation prior
012 occasionally resulted in received levels which did not meet the parameters set in the sonar detector.
e 6, Line 17: This seems to be more suited for the discussion section.
and it was originally there. However, several co-authors felt we should point out in the results that
se short dives were also atypical in their depth, and that begged the question of atypical relative to
t. So we opted to provide this small amount of background here as well as in the Discussion.
e 6, Line 22: Is this near or far? unless the reader goes to the figure it is not clear if the effect is found when
whale is closer or further away from the mid-power MFAS source. I suggest you edit the text to state "at
er ditances..."
suggested edit would not be quite accurate. According to our model, which did not include an
raction between OL and distance, the effect of OL on dive duration is the same regardless of the
ance. Of course, distance also affects duration, so if we picked a different distance for this prediction,
line on the graph might shift up or down a little, but would keep the same shape for exposures at any
ance. Thus, we have retained the original wording here.

study did not use the Argos location estimates directly, which can be very imprecise and also quite
rse from beaked whales, given their limited time at the surface. We used the Argos locations to model
mal movements on a standardized interval (30 min). Each location estimate did include 95%
fidence intervals on the latitude and longitude, but we did not include a spatial uncertainty term in
model for several reasons. All whales were subject to similar, varying levels of spatial uncertainty in
r location estimates, and there was no reason to expect the level of uncertainty to be associated with
AS use. For each estimated location, there was equal probability that the whale could have been
er or farther from MFAS (sometimes by a little, sometimes by a lot), and we assume that given the
ple sizes in the study these differences will average out. Further, we were interested in trends
ociated with distance more than absolute values, and we assume that spatial uncertainty (in both the
le and the source, given that we were only provided with the starting location and sources can move
siderable distances while transmitting) is just one of many factors that contribute to the precision of
model estimates, which were provided.
e 8, Line 27: While I acknowledge the fact that ships can be likely detected by beaked whales further away
helicopters, and thus an association can be made for ship noise and MFAS emission, assuming surface
s broadcast MFAS for extended periods seems incorrect unless naval exercises at SOAR are very specific
e use of MFAS. Furthermore, sudden emission of MFAS by surface ships was considered a key element in
beaked whale mass stranding in the Canary Islands in 2002.
do not assume ships at SOAR broadcast MFAS for extended periods, we have considerable data to
port this. The SOAR archives have verified detections of ships broadcasting MFAS for up to 449
utes, and multi-hour transmissions are not at all uncommon. That said, we are unclear how the
ation of local MFAS use bouts pertains to the potential for whales to recognize the sound signature of
s with the potential for MFAS use, and to alter their behavior in the presence of these ships even
n they are not broadcasting- which is the possibility we are suggesting.
e 8, Line 31: This is a important point that deserves further discussion. Maybe reading the reports and
lications from the September 2002 stranding in the Canary Islands would help enrich this discussion.
aim of this study was to broadly identify fairly coarse behavioural changes associated with highly
marized sonar use. A detailed exploration of sonar context, which can be quite variable even within
fundamental differences we see between ships and helicopters, is beyond the scope of this paper and
g undertaken separately.
e 8, Line 37: This is perhaps the most interesting point of the study. Other studies on the effect of sonar
beaked whales have shown the opposite, abrupt abortion of deep dives (although not always the case),
ch in turn could be the mechanistic pathway through which sonar may lead to stranding and/or death of
ked whales. See Jepson et al., 2003; 2005; Fernandez et al., 2004; 2005; Cox et al., 2006.
have an excellent dataset and series of results to further expand the discussion towards enriching our
erstanding on the potential for behavioural mediated mechanisms for mass strandings.
are aware of only four behavioral response studies of beaked whales exposed to sonar, all of which
ed on scaled source playbacks of 1-2 individuals, none of which showed cessation of deep dives, but in
increased dive duration (see DeRuiter et al. 2013 for Cuvier’s beaked whales, Tyack et al. 2010 for
nville’s beaked whale, Miller et al. 2015 for Northern Bottlenose Whales, and Stimpert et al. 2014 for
d’s beaked whale). We are aware that earlier authors have suggested rapid ascent as the most
ious behavior change that could lead to DCS-like symptoms based on our understanding of DCS in
an divers, but this has never been documented as a sonar response (you may be thinking of Aguilar
o et al. (2006) who suggested a tagged Cuvier’s had truncated a dive due to a noisy ship).
ortunately, our tags cannot provide ascent rate data, which precludes our ability to say more than
t it is less likely to be occurring here based on trends in our data.
e 8, Line 39: You have not considered the fact that these whales need short dives down to 100-400 m to
pensate for the nitrogen supersaturation after long deeper dives. This study hits right in the middle of the
troversial discussion on behaviourally mediated rather than physiologically mediated mass strandings, but
do not connect your results to the risks of altering the very specialized dive profiles in this species, likely
ped by gas saturation limits in blood and release mechanisms.
e 8, Line 43: Do you think these changes could also help dealing with nitrogen supersaturation?
llow dives are no longer believed to be biologically necessary to manage nitrogen loads in beaked
les, at least not in an immediate way. Tyack et al. (2006) discussed this issue in the context of their
G recordings of the diving of Ziphius and M. densitrostris, and pointed out how in fact the shallow
s of the IDDI are more likely to increase DCS risk than to decrease it. Both Baird et al. (2008) and
orr et al. (2014) noted significant diel patterns in the use of water midwater and surface depths, but
in deep diving, suggesting that behaviors in the IDDI are less physiologically constrained than initially
ught. Furthermore, deep dives with no intervening shallow dives have been documented numerous
es in this species as data collection has expanded. As noted previously, our coarse dive data are not
lly suited to address this topic with current physiological models. Fahlman et al. (2014) is the best
ilable summary of potential risk mechanisms, but there is insufficient data here or elsewhere to
firm if any of them are actually occurring.
ever, we agree with the reviewer’s suggestion that we should connect our results with the
otheses about sonar-induced behavioral response and nitrogen management. Therefore, we have
red this paragraph and the following one to address the reviewer’s numerous comments about
ogen. We have replaced the following:
le the behavioural records used in this analysis did not provide a detailed record of precisely where in the water
mn a whale was at a given time, abruptly surfacing from either deep or shallow dives, which would have
umably led to shorter than expected dive durations, did not appear to be a typical response to MFAS for these
les.
h:
mechanism of sonar-induced behavioural response that has been proposed to explain the coincidence of
ndings and sonar has been rapid ascent from a deep dive, resulting in the deleterious effects of gas bubble
ation especially when tissues are supersaturated with nitrogen [5,7]. The dive data from this study do not
ude ascent rates, so we cannot directly address this hypothesis, other than to observe that none of the tagged
les displayed any post-MFAS behaviour that was indicative of morbidity. However, one might hypothesize that
e typical response to MFAS was to abort a dive and surface abruptly, then when MFAS exposure is frequent,
durations would tend to be shorter than average, which we did not observe.
we have replaced the beginning of the next paragraph:
re may be limits to the extent whales use depth to mitigate exposure, however.
h:
aining at depth during MFAS exposure may reduce received levels, but that response could increase the risk of
S symptoms, especially if the whales were at depths above the presumed depth of alveolar collapse, in the region
re nitrogen continues to be transferred from the lungs to the tissues [13,34]. Spending additional time below the
h of lung collapse can also exacerbate DCS risk by increasing the transfer of nitrogen from tissues with fast
ke rates (e.g., muscle, heart) to slow tissues (i.e., fat), which will lead to greater levels of nitrogen accumulation
. These negative impacts of increasing time at depth may therefore limit the extent whales use depth to mitigate
r exposure.
e 8, Line 46: Mediated by?
oted above, this paragraph was modified to explain how physiological mechanisms for decreasing
ogen accumulation may limit how much a whale can avoid the highest received levels simply by
nding more time at depth.
e 8, Line 56: Consider if increase in pressure has a stronger effect on gas saturation than increase in
tion but constant pressure...
ond the depth of alveolar collapse, depth, and therefore ambient pressure, has no effect on nitrogen
ration overall because there is no longer any additional nitrogen uptake from the lungs.
e 9, Line 19: Why do you assume they are physiologically advantageous? you are not considering the risk
ecompression sickness due to nitrogen supersaturation. Shorter but more common surfacings could be
ained by longer dive periods triggered by MFAS exposure.
his sentence, we have replaced the term “oxygen demands” with “gas exchange demands”. Long
s will reduce oxygen stores and increase carbon dioxide partial pressures. There’s a limit to how fast
se gases can be exchanged at the surface, so in some case increasing surface interval duration is
uired in order to reach a reasonable pre-dive level of these gases, as well as nitrogen.
e 9, Line 29: This paragraph would be a good place to expand the discussion with important missing points:
beaked whales in this area residents? are they habituated to MFAS and thus their behavioural responses
r from what has been described in other regions? is naivety an important factor in the risk of exposure?
prefer to leave this paragraph as is, focusing on our data specifically. However, we will expand our
tment of implications of habituation and risk to the species elsewhere in the Conclusion.
e 9, Line 55: Which is directly related to experience, habituation, or naivety. It would be nice if this subject
scussed further as you have a unique dataset to explore it.
agree that this is an interesting subject, but don't believe we currently have the dataset with which
o into great detail. While we do have long-term sighting histories for many whales in our population,
do not know their specific exposure history, nor how it might have shaped their behavior. We only
w that some whales do not conform to the pattern predicted by the aggregate dataset, and this
tributes to variability in the model predictions. Further, we do not have a comparable dataset from
cologically-similar, presumably “naïve” population to compare these behaviors against, we can only
ak to how these whales, who are likely exposed fairly regularly, deal with sonar here.
e 9, Line 59: I find this sentence hard to understand. Page 10, 2: Also confusing, what do you mean by
osed IDDIs?
phrase “exposed IDDIs” was meant to indicate IDDIs that overlapped at least partly with MFAS use. We’ve
ified the text to clarify this point:

rated by these aberrant deep dives should actually be summed into a single extended IDDI, at least where IDDI

revised this section:
iability in predictions was likely associated with how the source was used (continuous vs. intermittent
smission bouts),

ch can also be assumed to be a disruption of what we think is "normal" feeding behaviour. You might want
xpand this statement. Page 10, Line 35: Don't you think that disruption of deep dives too?
revised these statements:

re IDDI was instead reduced during MFAS use, there is evidence that the whale did not actually resume
ging on its next deep dive, and thus the foraging disruption effect may be even stronger than these results
gest.
e 10, Line 49: as well as environmental, it might not just be based on behaviour but also on sound
agation conditions, prey accessibility, etc.
final paragraph was substantially revised in response to comments by reviewer 1. We also added the
owing to the end of the preceding paragraph to highlight the role environmental factors might play in
diating response and its effects:
