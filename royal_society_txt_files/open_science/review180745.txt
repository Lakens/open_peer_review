The manuscript describes a comparison between several methods for modelling low Reynolds
number swimming cells, in particular resistive force theory, regularized stokeslets and the finite
element method. The principal novelty is claimed as establishing that resistive force theory fails
to capture the effect of the cell body, which is referred to as a subject of 'debate' in the
introduction.
However, detailed comparisons between resistive force theory and slender body theory, with and
without the cell body, were published by Johnson and Brokaw (Biophys J 1979). Moreover, Ramia
et al. (Biophys J 1993) compared boundary element methods (a more accurate version of
regularized stokeslets) with slender body theory, and also extracted resistance coefficients. These
two papers more or less resolved completely the question of the accuracy of resistive force theory
and slender body theory relative to a highly accurate scheme for swimming cells (also, slender
body theory is not 'the same class of approximation as RFT' despite what the authors claim in
their introduction).
It is also claimed that the zero Reynolds number approximation is a subject of debate for sperm
flagella, because the standard calculation does not refer to the wavelength. However the
wavelength is on the order of the flagellar length, so this is also completely uncontroversial.
For these reasons I do not believe the manuscript advances scientific knowledge and I do not
recommend for publication.

This is a useful contribution for researchers who wish to use computational fluid dynamics to
model flagellar motility. Simple resistive force theory is widely used to approximate flagellar
swimming velocity based upon given wave kinematics. However, for some body geometries, this
approximation has been shown to be very inaccurate. This manuscript compares results from
RFT to high fidelity regularized Stokeslet calculations and finite element calculations.
Characteristics of flagellar forms where RFT gives good results are discussed. Moreover, the
comparisons between methods are also performed for a full cell body/flagellum system.
This manuscript should be published after the following points are addressed:
1. It took this reader some time to realize that both the surface of the cell body *and* the
flagellum were being discretized in the regularized Stokeslet system, rather than
just representing the flagellum by its centerline and using the blob size to reflect flagellar radius.
This should be made clear up front in the section on reg Stokeslets.
2. There have been other works that have elucidated the waveforms where RFT fails to give
reasonable results (compared to regularized Stokeslets). These two manuscripts, for instance,
should be cited:
a) Martindale, Jabbarzadeh, Fu. Phys. Fluids, 28, 2016.
b) Jung, Mareck, Fauci, Shelley. Phys. Fluids, 19, 2007.
3. The writing is sometimes grammatically incorrect , and oftentimes notation is not sufficiently
defined. Examples: Page 1, line 52 "Bacterias flagella". Page 3, line 10. "To answer the first two
questions..." There are no questions posed above this.
Page 3, r_nm not defined. Careful proofreading needs to be done.

The manuscript studies sperm-like flagellar motility using different numerical methods and
approximations. It then discusses their accuracies in a comprehensive way. Such a comparative
research provides useful information in the community and also fits well with the journal aims
and purposes. I thus recommend the manuscript for publication. Here I am listing some
comments, most of which are at the presentation level.
(1) p1 Third line of Section 1, typo: Bacterias -> Bacterial?
(2) p3 Eq(2.3) diadic expression rr^T is different from tt in p12 Eq.(3.2)
(3) p3 Eq(2.4) Usually, a boundary integral expression of the Stokes flow requires the double layer
potential (see textbook of Pozrikidis 'Boundary Integral and Singularity Methods for Linearized
Viscous'). I could not find this expression from Ref[9].
(4) p3 Sentence just after Eq(2.5), I do not understand 'The Stokeslets are singular non-integrable
kernels'. The single-layer integral of Eq.(2.4) is weakly singular and thus can be integrated (see
also Pozrikidis' textbook).
(5) P5 Eq (2.8) \omega should be a vector, but not written in boldface. We find the same typos in
Eq.(3.1)
(6) P9, Fig4. typos: lefta, righta.
(7) p10 It is difficult to distinguish the plots. I would rather suggest that the figure should be
enlarged. Probably legends (as in Fig1) are helpful for readers. The three plots for the spherical
head cases (solid-blue, circle-magenta, dashed-green) would correspond to the results with
different numerical methods, but the details are not shown.
(8) P11 Table 1. I could not find explanations on the numbers of the second low. Are these orders
of magnitude of the coefficients? (also in Table 4 in P14)
(9) P16 Fig10 last line of the caption. 'The red triangle' is a bit confusing, as magenta triangles are
also shown in the same plot. Here, legends as in the left top panel are also helpful for readers.
(10) Subsections are referred only by alphabets, eg. just after Eq(3.4) in p12 such as Section (c).
This makes it difficult to read. Please add the section number as well as subsection number, such
as Section 2(c).

Comments to the Author(s)

First of all, I'd like to emphasise that I think the authors are a good group, are building capability
in useful techniques (finite element models of swimmers, regularized stokeslet methods) and I
can see them using these techniques to great effect in the field of microscale propulsion. I
appreciate my opinion on the present manuscript may seem negative, however I have to give a
scientifically honest view. Given that the other reviewers were positive, and that the authors
disagree with my comments, I should explain myself in more detail. I will then leave it to the
editor to decide which way to call it.
To recap, the authors have revisited a fairly intensively-studied problem, the zero-Reynolds
number propulsion of flagellated microorganisms. It is shown that two versions of resistive force
theory are inaccurate compared with the authors' implementations via finite elements and
regularized stokeslets. The latter methods are not novel, but this is not my main criticism. Rather,
my original review pointed out earlier uncited work by Johnson and Brokaw (1979), in addition
to some BEM studies (1987, 1994) which showed that RFT has substantial errors relative to more
accurate methods, which dealt with the question already. The authors' response is along the lines
that these were 'semi-analytical studies from the 1970s', they 'lacked a realistic description of the
flexible flagellum' and involved 'BEM rigid-body solutions on coarse grids', compared with their
own 'high fidelity resolution'. I've considered their comments along with revisiting these papers,
but my view is still firmly that their paper is not novel. Moreover, their characterization of the
earlier work ('coarse, semi-analytical 1970s') relative to their own ('high fidelity') is lapsing into
rhetoric somewhat. I've also identified a few other more recent papers and a thesis that contain
similar findings and discussion. More detailed comments follow, but in summary my view is
unchanged: the present manuscript does not present new information, so I do not recommend for
publication.
Detailed comments:
The modern study of microscale propulsion started in the early 1950s, with key papers by
Hancock (Proc R Soc 1953) and Gray & Hancock (J exp Biol 1955), which developed Slender Body
Theory and its algebraic approximation Resistive Force Theory. These theories were refined and
revisited throughout the 1960s and 70s. In particular, Lighthill's 1976 Jon von Neumann lecture
discussed in detail the issue of the accuracy of resistance coefficients, and indeed the idea of
'suboptimal' coefficients that compromised accuracy for a range of beat patterns. Certainly there
was no illusion that RFT was particularly accurate - rather it was convenient and provided
reasonable estimates.
A little later, Higdon (a student of Lighthill) published several papers in 1979 developing finite
amplitude slender body theory, and taking into account head-flagellum interaction (albeit with a
spherical head). Flexing flagella as well as helical rigid rotators were considered. Higdon [JFM 90,
685-711, 1979] compared RFT with Lighthill's coefficients to his own SBT. In Higdon's words 'we
conclude that resistance coefficients are unsatisfactory for a complete description of the
swimming of micro-organisms. Their values can be optimized for one quantity such as
10
swimming speed, but they cannot give an accurate estimate for power consumption... thus we
feel that it is not worthwhile attempting to devise ever 'improved' coefficients when the problem
can be solved in a straightforward manner as described above'. At this point we could stop, but if
you are in doubt, please read on...
Around the same time, R.E. Johnson developed a beautiful version of slender body theory
through matched asymptotic expansions, the error term being quadratic in slenderness. This is
_very_ accurate for most applications, and I think it is unfair of the authors to try to dismiss this
as a 'semi-analytical study from the 1970s'. Johnson's mathematical theory was used in the paper
of Johnson and Brokaw (dated one year earlier) which showed that for some quite realistic
flexible flagellar beats, RFT can give reasonably accurate forces and moments, but only with an
empirical adjustment to the coefficients, and it fails in the presence of a significant-sized cell
body.
It may be possible to improve incrementally on the accuracy of these (already very accurate)
benchmark studies (although modern results are not necessarily more accurate just because they
involve modern computers). However, incremental improvements in accuracy don't really
provide any new information regarding the question at hand: it was absolutely clear in 1980 that
RFT was inaccurate.
A few subsequent studies have benchmarked against SBT and RFT, generally as part of a larger
study - the comparison alone is not enough to hang a paper on. I mentioned the BEM work of
Phan-Thien et al. [JFM 1987] and Ramia et al. [Biophys J 1993]. I agree these involved rigid body
motions of the flagellum, however the introduction of flexibility hardly changes the conclusion
that RFT is inaccurate. What this paper did do was emphasize (it was at all doubted) that
Higdon's SBT was very trustworthy indeed. The present authors try to characterize this work
rather disparagingly as 'BEM rigid-body solutions on coarse grids' however the grids are not
particularly coarse and convergence was tested carefully against known analytics, showing close
to 1% error. The fact is that BEM is a much more efficient method than either FEM or regularized
stokeslets for microscale motility, and so it was possible to get accurate results with 1980s
computers and programming languages. (By the way, the strategy of trying to create doubt
around work of the standing of Higdon, Johnson, Brokaw and Phan-Thien is not a good one in
my book).
There are a few other more recent papers that present very similar results to the present authors
in the more modern setting of FEM and regularized stokeslets. Tabak's recent work (Computers
and Fluids 99, 190-198, 2014) compares RFT with constant and variable coefficients to FEM, just
like the present authors. They find that 'resistance coefficients do not address the effect of
hydrodynamic interactions between the body and the tail'. Rodenborn et al. [PNAS 110, E338–
E347, 2013] compare regularized stokeslets to RFT (two different coefficients) and also SBT. Also
Rodenborn et al's paper shows just how uncertain convergence of regularized stokeslet methods
can be (see figure 8) - arguably the real 'high fidelity' work was done in the 1980s with BEM!
Finally, Jesus Gonzalez's thesis is also worth a look (University of Manchester 2017 - see pages 49-
57 for review and 144-148 for new results comparing RFT and regularized stokeslet methods) -
url here: https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/numerical-analysis-of-
fluid-motion-at-low-reynolds-numbers(4cf30194-0155-439d-879a-c49787549e8c).html
...so even if we weren't persuaded by the 70s/80s work, these more modern studies also have it
covered.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
Thank you for submitting this revision. The majority of referees are in favour of publication;
however, given the comments of the second referee in particular, the Editors are issuing an
'accept with minor revisions' decision. The explanation for this is below:
1) The second referee feels that the literature review and discussion you have conducted misses
some important earlier works that set the scene for your research, and in particular why your
work represents an advance on the existing state of the art. With this in mind, we would ask that,
in submitting your revision, you discuss in your introduction and/or discussion sections at least
the most pertinent of the earlier works mentioned by the referee. This will help situate your work
in the wider context of the field, and will add value to readers, without placing undue burdens on
you as authors. As Royal Society Open Science lacks a word limit, you have the space to ensure a
fuller context is provided.
2) It has been observed that, while you indicate in your data accessibility statement the data/code

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
First of all, I'd like to emphasise that I think the authors are a good group, are building capability
in useful techniques (finite element models of swimmers, regularized stokeslet methods) and I
can see them using these techniques to great effect in the field of microscale propulsion. I
appreciate my opinion on the present manuscript may seem negative, however I have to give a
scientifically honest view. Given that the other reviewers were positive, and that the authors
disagree with my comments, I should explain myself in more detail. I will then leave it to the
editor to decide which way to call it.
To recap, the authors have revisited a fairly intensively-studied problem, the zero-Reynolds
number propulsion of flagellated microorganisms. It is shown that two versions of resistive force
theory are inaccurate compared with the authors' implementations via finite elements and
regularized stokeslets. The latter methods are not novel, but this is not my main criticism. Rather,
my original review pointed out earlier uncited work by Johnson and Brokaw (1979), in addition
to some BEM studies (1987, 1994) which showed that RFT has substantial errors relative to more
accurate methods, which dealt with the question already. The authors' response is along the lines
that these were 'semi-analytical studies from the 1970s', they 'lacked a realistic description of the
flexible flagellum' and involved 'BEM rigid-body solutions on coarse grids', compared with their
own 'high fidelity resolution'. I've considered their comments along with revisiting these papers,
but my view is still firmly that their paper is not novel. Moreover, their characterization of the
earlier work ('coarse, semi-analytical 1970s') relative to their own ('high fidelity') is lapsing into
rhetoric somewhat. I've also identified a few other more recent papers and a thesis that contain
similar findings and discussion. More detailed comments follow, but in summary my view is
unchanged: the present manuscript does not present new information, so I do not recommend for
publication.
Detailed comments:
The modern study of microscale propulsion started in the early 1950s, with key papers by
Hancock (Proc R Soc 1953) and Gray & Hancock (J exp Biol 1955), which developed Slender Body
Theory and its algebraic approximation Resistive Force Theory. These theories were refined and
revisited throughout the 1960s and 70s. In particular, Lighthill's 1976 Jon von Neumann lecture
discussed in detail the issue of the accuracy of resistance coefficients, and indeed the idea of
'suboptimal' coefficients that compromised accuracy for a range of beat patterns. Certainly there
was no illusion that RFT was particularly accurate - rather it was convenient and provided
reasonable estimates.
A little later, Higdon (a student of Lighthill) published several papers in 1979 developing finite
16
amplitude slender body theory, and taking into account head-flagellum interaction (albeit with a
spherical head). Flexing flagella as well as helical rigid rotators were considered. Higdon [JFM 90,
685-711, 1979] compared RFT with Lighthill's coefficients to his own SBT. In Higdon's words 'we
conclude that resistance coefficients are unsatisfactory for a complete description of the
swimming of micro-organisms. Their values can be optimized for one quantity such as
swimming speed, but they cannot give an accurate estimate for power consumption... thus we
feel that it is not worthwhile attempting to devise ever 'improved' coefficients when the problem
can be solved in a straightforward manner as described above'. At this point we could stop, but if
you are in doubt, please read on...
Around the same time, R.E. Johnson developed a beautiful version of slender body theory
through matched asymptotic expansions, the error term being quadratic in slenderness. This is
_very_ accurate for most applications, and I think it is unfair of the authors to try to dismiss this
as a 'semi-analytical study from the 1970s'. Johnson's mathematical theory was used in the paper
of Johnson and Brokaw (dated one year earlier) which showed that for some quite realistic
flexible flagellar beats, RFT can give reasonably accurate forces and moments, but only with an
empirical adjustment to the coefficients, and it fails in the presence of a significant-sized cell
body.
It may be possible to improve incrementally on the accuracy of these (already very accurate)
benchmark studies (although modern results are not necessarily more accurate just because they
involve modern computers). However, incremental improvements in accuracy don't really
provide any new information regarding the question at hand: it was absolutely clear in 1980 that
RFT was inaccurate.
A few subsequent studies have benchmarked against SBT and RFT, generally as part of a larger
study - the comparison alone is not enough to hang a paper on. I mentioned the BEM work of
Phan-Thien et al. [JFM 1987] and Ramia et al. [Biophys J 1993]. I agree these involved rigid body
motions of the flagellum, however the introduction of flexibility hardly changes the conclusion
that RFT is inaccurate. What this paper did do was emphasize (it was at all doubted) that
Higdon's SBT was very trustworthy indeed. The present authors try to characterize this work
rather disparagingly as 'BEM rigid-body solutions on coarse grids' however the grids are not
particularly coarse and convergence was tested carefully against known analytics, showing close
to 1% error. The fact is that BEM is a much more efficient method than either FEM or regularized
stokeslets for microscale motility, and so it was possible to get accurate results with 1980s
computers and programming languages. (By the way, the strategy of trying to create doubt
around work of the standing of Higdon, Johnson, Brokaw and Phan-Thien is not a good one in
my book).
There are a few other more recent papers that present very similar results to the present authors
in the more modern setting of FEM and regularized stokeslets. Tabak's recent work (Computers
and Fluids 99, 190-198, 2014) compares RFT with constant and variable coefficients to FEM, just
like the present authors. They find that 'resistance coefficients do not address the effect of
hydrodynamic interactions between the body and the tail'. Rodenborn et al. [PNAS 110, E338–
E347, 2013] compare regularized stokeslets to RFT (two different coefficients) and also SBT. Also
Rodenborn et al's paper shows just how uncertain convergence of regularized stokeslet methods
can be (see figure 8) - arguably the real 'high fidelity' work was done in the 1980s with BEM!
Finally, Jesus Gonzalez's thesis is also worth a look (University of Manchester 2017 - see pages 49-
57 for review and 144-148 for new results comparing RFT and regularized stokeslet methods) -

...so even if we weren't persuaded by the 70s/80s work, these more modern studies also have it
covered.

Appendix A
Dear Editor,
We thank all reviewers for the insightful comments which we have used to further
improve the quality of the original manuscript. Following these, a few new paragraphs of
discussion have been included in the text as well as several more references. Our point-
to-point replies to the reviewers’ comments are below
Reviewer 1
1. The manuscript describes a comparison between several methods for modelling low
Reynolds number swimming cells, in particular resistive force theory, regularized
stokeslets and the finite element method. The principal novelty is claimed as establishing
that resistive force theory fails to capture the effect of the cell body, which is referred to
as a subject of 'debate' in the introduction.
However, detailed comparisons between resistive force theory and slender body theory,
with and without the cell body, were published by Johnson and Brokaw (Biophys J 1979).
Moreover, Ramia et al. (Biophys J 1993) compared boundary element methods (a more
accurate version of regularized stokeslets) with slender body theory, and also extracted
resistance coefficients. These two papers more or less resolved completely the question of
the accuracy of resistive force theory and slender body theory relative to a highly
accurate scheme for swimming cells
We thank the reviewer for pointing out these two classical papers to us which discussion
we have included in the introduction. However, we disagree with the reviewer that these
two papers, which in combination may appear to suggest that RFT is as good as SBT,
SBT is as good as BEM, and the BEM rigid-body solutions on coarse grids, which were
affordable in the 1990s, are as good as the direct solution of the Stokes equation with a
high-fidelity resolution of the moving swimmer body, completely resolve the question of
applicability of RFT as implied by the reviewer. Indeed, the semi-analytical models
which were developed in the 1970s lack a realistic description of the flexible flagellum
motion including the end parts and the early computational studies in the 1990s were also
limited by numerical resolution of the flagellum body. The required numerical resolution
has now become available thanks to the increase of computing power, hence, our current
work to use it for a systematic comparison of different models. Our work is also
consistent with the state-of-the art literature which shows that the accuracy of RFT is no
longer satisfactory at the current stage of development of computational and experimental
methods. To emphasise this, a new discussion paragraph is also added in the conclusions.
2. (also, slender body theory is not 'the same class of approximation as RFT' despite what
the authors claim in their introduction).
We have rephrased the offending sentence.
3. It is also claimed that the zero Reynolds number approximation is a subject of debate
for sperm flagella, because the standard calculation does not refer to the wavelength.
However the wavelength is on the order of the flagellar length, so this is also completely
uncontroversial.
We have modified the paragraph for clarity.
Our assertion is that the Reynolds number scaling based on the wavelength and that based
on the linear swimmer size is only accurate for idealised swimmer models such as the one
considered by Johnson and Brokaw (1979).
Reviewer 2
This is a useful contribution for researchers who wish to use computational fluid
dynamics to model flagellar motility. Simple resistive force theory is widely used to
approximate flagellar swimming velocity based upon given wave kinematics. However,
for some body geometries, this approximation has been shown to be very
inaccurate. This manuscript compares results from RFT to high fidelity regularized
Stokeslet calculations and finite element calculations. Characteristics of flagellar forms
where RFT gives good results are discussed. Moreover, the comparisons between
methods are also performed for a full cell body/flagellum system.
This manuscript should be published after the following points are addressed:
1. It took this reader some time to realize that both the surface of the cell body and the
flagellum were being discretized in the regularized Stokeslet system, rather than
just representing the flagellum by its centerline and using the blob size to reflect flagellar
radius. This should be made clear up front in the section on reg Stokeslets.
A new sentence is included for clarity after equation (2.5).
2. There have been other works that have elucidated the waveforms where RFT fails to
give reasonable results (compared to regularized Stokeslets). These two manuscripts, for
instance, should be cited:
a) Martindale, Jabbarzadeh, Fu. Phys. Fluids, 28, 2016.
b) Jung, Mareck, Fauci, Shelley. Phys. Fluids, 19, 2007.
The new references are included in the manuscript and discussed in section 4
“Conclusions”.
3. The writing is sometimes grammatically incorrect , and oftentimes notation is not
sufficiently defined. Examples: Page 1, line 52 "Bacterias flagella". Page 3, line 10.
"To answer the first two questions..." There are no questions posed above this.
Page 3, r_nm not defined. Careful proofreading needs to be done.
We have corrected the typos, proofread the text and edited it where needed.
Reviewer 3
The manuscript studies sperm-like flagellar motility using different numerical methods
and approximations. It then discusses their accuracies in a comprehensive way. Such a
comparative research provides useful information in the community and also fits well
with the journal aims and purposes. I thus recommend the manuscript for publication.
Here I am listing some comments, most of which are at the presentation level.
(1) p1 Third line of Section 1, typo: Bacterias -> Bacterial?
Corrected
(2) p3 Eq(2.3) diadic expression rr^T is different from tt in p12 Eq.(3.2)
Corrected
(3) p3 Eq(2.4) Usually, a boundary integral expression of the Stokes flow requires the
double layer potential (see textbook of Pozrikidis 'Boundary Integral and Singularity
Methods for Linearized Viscous'). I could not find this expression from Ref[9].
Corrected
(4) p3 Sentence just after Eq(2.5), I do not understand 'The Stokeslets are singular non-
integrable kernels'. The single-layer integral of Eq.(2.4) is weakly singular and thus can
be integrated (see also Pozrikidis' textbook).
Thank you for pointing this out, we were referring to the more general case of when
forces may also be applied along curves or discrete points as commented in Cortez R,
Fauci L, Medovikov A. Phys. Fluids 17, 1–14 (2005) as opposed to the case of close
Lyapunov surfaces, which is the requirement for the kernel of the single-layer potential to
be weakly singular (Pozrikidis, section 4.1). Since the specification “non-integrable” can
indeed generate confusion without a proper discussion we now removed it.
(5) P5 Eq (2.8) \omega should be a vector, but not written in boldface. We find the same
typos in Eq.(3.1)
Corrected
(6) P9, Fig4. typos: lefta, righta.
Corrected
(7) p10 It is difficult to distinguish the plots. I would rather suggest that the figure should
be enlarged. Probably legends (as in Fig1) are helpful for readers. The three plots for the
spherical head cases (solid-blue, circle-magenta, dashed-green) would correspond to the
results with different numerical methods, but the details are not shown.
Corrected
(8) P11 Table 1. I could not find explanations on the numbers of the second low. Are
these orders of magnitude of the coefficients? (also in Table 4 in P14)
Corrected
(9) P16 Fig10 last line of the caption. 'The red triangle' is a bit confusing, as magenta
triangles are also shown in the same plot. Here, legends as in the left top panel are also
helpful for readers.
Corrected
(10) Subsections are referred only by alphabets, eg. just after Eq(3.4) in p12 such as
Section (c). This makes it difficult to read. Please add the section number as well as
subsection number, such as Section 2(c).
Corrected
Appendix B
Dear Editor,
We thank Reviewer 1 for pointing us to the useful references in the literature now
discussed in the text: see page 3 of the manuscript, third paragraph onward. In the new
text we also stress the novelty aspects of our work.
