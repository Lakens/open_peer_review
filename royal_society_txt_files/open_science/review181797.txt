Title: Differences in stress reactivity between zebrafish with alternative stress coping styles
Individuals vary in their behavioral responses to stressful conditions and, in some cases, may
show consistent individual responses across contexts. The frameworks of 'behavioral syndromes'
and 'animal personality,' predict that it may be possible to categorize animals qualitatively by
consistent behavioral responses into 'proactive' and 'reactive' stress-coping styles. Despite these
styles potentially representing only part of a broader spectrum of individual variation in
behavior, and the expectation that such discrete behavioral phenotypes should only be expected
when distinct adaptive behavioral peaks are present in the selective landscape, several studies
have attempted to identify the genetic, neuroendocrine, or endocrine differences between fish
expressing 'proactive' or 'reactive' behavioral phenotypes, with the ultimate goal of
understanding the proximate mechanisms that underlie these phenotypic differences.
This manuscript describes the results of an experiment testing for differences in glucocorticoid
stress reactivity profiles in 'proactive' and 'reactive' zebrafish (Danio rerio) using artificially-
selected genetic lines that were bred to differ in behavioral responses to an acute stressor.
Specifically, genetic lines had been selected to show either high or low stationary behaviors
during an 'open field assay' test. In this study, the authors exposed these genetic lines of zebrafish
to a 'Novel Tank' stressor test and then recorded their behavioral responses including the amount
of time spent swimming/moving and the duration of time spent within the bottom or top half of
the tank. The authors then used that behavioral data to identify a subset of fish from each genetic
line with consistent responses based on those behavioral measures, and therefore could be
categorized into discrete 'proactive' or 'reactive' coping styles; fish that spent more than 151 s of
the first 6 min in the bottom zone of the tank were classified as 'reactive', while fish spending
more than 151 s in the top zone of the tank were considered 'proactive.' The authors then
sacrificed fish and measured whole-body cortisol levels to evaluate whether these 'reactive' and
'proactive' fish difference in glucocorticoid reactivity to the 'novel tank' test.
In brief, 'reactive' zebrafish were observed to have higher whole-body cortisol than 'proactive'
fish 6 min after exposure to the 'novel tank' test. Since 'reactive' and 'proactive' fish no longer
differed in whole-body cortisol 30 min after stressor exposure, these differences at 6 min suggest
that the groups differ in HPI axis reactivity. The authors also observed a sex difference in whole-
body cortisol response, with males zebrafish having higher whole-body cortisol concentrations at
the 6 min sampling time following stressor exposure.
While the overall aim of this study - to test whether differences in the behavioral response to
stressors are underlain by differences in reactivity of the HPI endocrine axis - the manuscript in
its present form should be revised to clarify several issues. Those issues are outlined below.
Major Issues (listed in order of importance for revision)
1) Baseline group. Individual zebrafish sampled at the 6 min and 30 min time points to generate
the stress reactivity data were subsets of the High Stationary Behavior (HSB) and Low Stationary
Behavior (LSB) artificially-selected lines. Those subsets were fish identified as showing consistent
3
differences in depth preference in the 'novel tank' test (described in lines 118-126). Fish used for
the baseline time point, however, were haphazardly selected from home tanks holding fish of the
HSB and LSB lines (lines 131-133), and did not appear to be the same subset of fish classified as
'proactive' or 'reactive' based on the depth preferences. As such, the baseline fish are not a valid
indicator of what baseline whole-body cortisol levels would be in the 'proactive' and 'reactive'
groups, as they were likely to include a large scope of behavioral and (based on the author's
hypothesis) neuroendocrine phenotypic variation.
Ideally, the authors would have used previously identified 'proactive' and 'reactive' fish for the
baseline sample. Since this may not be possible at this time, the authors should revise Figures 1
and 2a to clearly indicate that the baseline fish are not equivalent to the 6 min and 30 min fish
(perhaps by adding a dotted line between the baseline and 6 min samples, or gray shading the 0
min area of the plot). Similarly, the statistical analyses should be conducted for the 6 min and 30
min alone, and a separate analysis conducted for the two groups of baseline fish.
2) Clarity of HSB/LSB versus proactive/reactive phenotypes. The authors need to revise the
manuscript to make the distinction between these phenotypes more clear to the reader. If I
understand correctly, the genetic lines of zebrafish were artificially selected for HSB/LSB
behaviors. The authors then are using those lines to identify individuals from each line showing
'extremes' of depth preference phenotypes following stress, and are referring to those phenotypes
as "proactive' (for select fish coming from the LSB line) and "reactive" (for select fish coming from
the HSB line). That needs to be made more clear to the reader in a revised version of the
manuscript. I think that this could be done by revising the sentences describing the experimental
design (Lines 82-93). Part of the confusion arises because the authors state that they are testing
the HSB line versus the LSB line (see Lines 90-91, for instance), but are actually testing a
particular phenotypic subset of the HSB line ("reactive" fish) versus a subset of LSB line
("proactive" fish).
3) Use of the term 'neuroendocrine.' At several places in the manuscript, the authors refer to their
study examining "neuroendocrine responses" (see lines 24, 82, 199, 206, etc.). However, the
current study looked at whole-body cortisol levels…which is not a neuroendocrine response,
despite the HPI axis containing neuroendocrine signaling components such as CRH/CRF. This
needs to be revised throughout the manuscript. The response variable measured in the present
study should just be referred to as 'endocrine', given the data presented.
Minor comments:
1) Lines 20-21. For clarity, perhaps revise to the following: "Animals experience stress in a variety
of contexts, and the behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to stress can vary among
conspecifics."
2) Line 28. Which behaviors? Since the specific behavior of depth preference isn't described in the
Abstract, the reader has a difficult time evaluating the relevance of this manuscript to their own
interests/research.
3) Line 30. The term 'cortisol' release isn't really accurate here, as these are whole body cortisol
measures and not circulating. Hence, cortisol released from the interrenal is indistinguishable
from cortisol produced but not released. Please reword.
4) Line 42. Please add citations here.
5) Lines 68-69. The point made in this sentence should be made more explicitly: that circulating
cortisol concentrations may be influenced by several factors. Perhaps revise to: "Circulating
cortisol concentrations also have been shown to vary with other factors including sex and recent
behavioral experience, and such factors can contribute to individual variation in the temporal
responses of glucocorticoids following the perception of a stressor."
6) Lines 73-74. Revise to: "Other closely linked traits may also be selected indirectly."
7) Lines 80-81. This sentence is worded awkwardly. Please revise.
4
8) Line 83. Revise "selected to display divergent" to "selected for divergent"
9) Line 105. The stressor here in the Novel Tank Diving Test (NTDT) is just moving the fish to a
novel tank, is that correct? Perhaps make this explicit in this sentence for readers unfamiliar with
this test.
10) Lines 126-136. Please provide some number (n = ?) on how many fish were tested overall in
order to identify the fish used for cortisol sampling (aka, how many fish from each the HSB and
LSB lines were 'rejected' for not showing behaviors adhering to the "proactive" and "reactive"
types as outlined in Lines 118-128?)
11) Lines 170-173. Were Pearson correlations run on all fish combined, or "reactive" and
"proactive" groups separately? Or both?
12) Line 197. It's also possible that the reactive line shows a difference in glucocorticoid clearance
rate. That should be mentioned as an alternative hypothesis here.
13) Line 206. The use of "neuroendocrine stress response" here should be revised to "HPA/HPI
axis stress response", given that the present cortisol data and other studies being referenced refer
to circulating glucocorticoids, and not hypothalamic-pituitary pathways.
14) Lines 206-208. This claim that reactive individuals have a fasted cortisol release rate doesn't
seem to be well supported given the present data. Can the authors back this up further?
Otherwise, the statement is too speculative based on the data presented to this point in the
manuscript and should be revised. However, the date from reference [42], appears applicable
here. Please revise.
15) Line 235. Delete the extra "be" between "further" and "modulated"
16) Lines 236-237. Revise to "…differences in the duration.."
17) Lines 238-239. This phrase about coping styles and different fitness optima is speculative, so
should be worded as such. Perhaps revise to the following: "It has been proposed that discrete
coping styles may be maintained in a population…"
18) Line 251. By "strain" do you mean "line"? I don't think this term has been used previously in
the manuscript. For clarity, please use "line" here in Line 251 and in Line 301.
19) Lines 252-254. For clarity, revise to: "Our observation of higher stress-induced cortisol
concentrations in males than females was not expected. Instead, female-based elevation of post-
stressor cortisol levels has been seen across several taxa."
20) Lines 292-293. Do males of the HSB and LSB lines generally show greater movement? Is this
phenotypic difference seen even in the absence of partitioning HSB fish into "reactive" and "non-
reactive" HSBs? Similar for LSBs?
21) Figure 1. The authors need to indicate whether these are mean +/- SEM values, or +/-SD for
this and the other figures.
22) Table 1. It needs to be stated somewhere that these are p values being presented.

I have completed my review of the manuscript titled “Differences in stress reactivity between
zebrafish with alternative stress coping styles “ by Wong et al. The authors have executed a
brilliant, but simple, experiment that demonstrates differences in cortisol reactivity between two
coping styles. If I had one criticism, I would have like to see physiological data related to more
parts of the HPA axis (e.g., gene responses of cortisol receptors). This would help to identify what
parts of the pathway have been changed (perhaps the authors are currently working on this). I
typically do not have any “negative” major comments, but I am at a lost to find anything serious
enough to warrant any. I do, however, have some minor comments that the authors should be
able to address in a timely manner. My recommendation is to accept with minor revisions.
Minor comments
1) Review manuscript to ensure the past tense is being used. For example, line 82, “we investigate
…” where further in the paragraph the past tense is used.
2) Line 83 – it isn’t clear to me the purpose. I think the confusing part of the sentence is the
inclusion of the words after the colon.
3) More details needed on the HSB and LSB lines. For example, how long have they been
divergent (i.e., how many generations). What were the original parents (wild type?)? What was
the original selection experiment that assigned fish to the two lines?
4) 80 references is a bit much for a data focused paper.
5) Line 184 – should a reference be included?
6) The authors mention exposing zebrafish to a novel stressor. Unless I’m missing it, I didn’t see
in the methods why was used as the stressor.

In this manuscript, the authors quantified the whole-body cortisol levels in zebrafish that show
different behaviours in novel tank diving test. The authors found differences in cortisol levels at 6
min between the animals that show „reactive“ vs. „proactive“ stress coping style as measured by
the amount of time they spent in upper vs. lower zones in a novel tank. The authors also
measured the differences in male vs. female zebrafish in their cortisol response.
The study addresses interesting question of the relationship between neuroendocrine stress
response and coping style. While the question itself is interesting, I do have several major issues
with this manuscript.
1. The authors conclude „differences in cortisol levels between the alternative stress coping styles
are not just restricted to magnitude but also extends to the temporal dynamics.“ However the
authors only analysed 3 time points, 0, 6, and 30 min and showed that there is a difference only at
6. In so far as the temporal dynamics is the only thing that is measured in this manuscript, it
would be important for authors to show more data points to demonstrate the actual temporal
dynamics. They need to complete the time points at 12, 18, and 24 in addition to 6 and 30 min to
show the peak values and the rate of decrease.
2. One important question is whether different cortisol temporal dynamics shown in this
manuscript is a general feature of selectively bred lines with different coping styles regardless of
stressor type. Authors should test the temporal dynamic of the cortisol response of the lines to at
least another stressor.
3. How reactive and proactive lines defined by the authors other behavioural criteria (such as
open field test) fare in the NTDT need to be shown. Do reactive lines always show significantly
more bottom-dwelling behaviour compared to the proactive lines? For this study, the authors
chose a reactive line fish if it spent greater than 151 seconds of the first 6 minutes. They also need
to show the cortisol temporal profile of reactive line fish that may not show such a pronounced
behaviour. Such a fish may classify as “reactive” according to other behavioural criteria. In short
a more comprehensive analysis is required to compare how reactive and proactive fish line
behaves overall in NTDT test. Also the authors need to compare the cortisol response of different
reactive and proactive fish and their behaviour in the NTDT not only the ones that show most
pronounced behavioural differences in novel tank.
4. Somewhat related to the point 3, both in abstract and in the text the authors mention that they
couldn’t find correlations between individual variation of cortisol levels and behaviour, but this
important point is not shown. The authors need to show this data and address the point of
individual variation.

While the overall aim of this study - to test whether differences in the behavioral response to

20) Lines 292-293. Do males of the HSB and LSB lines generally show greater movement? Is this
phenotypic difference seen even in the absence of partitioning HSB fish into "reactive" and "non-
reactive" HSBs? Similar for LSBs?

Comments to the Author(s)
I have completed my review of the manuscript titled “Differences in stress reactivity between
zebrafish with alternative stress coping styles “ by Wong et al. The authors have executed a
brilliant, but simple, experiment that demonstrates differences in cortisol reactivity between two
coping styles. If I had one criticism, I would have like to see physiological data related to more
parts of the HPA axis (e.g., gene responses of cortisol receptors). This would help to identify what
parts of the pathway have been changed (perhaps the authors are currently working on this). I
typically do not have any “negative” major comments, but I am at a lost to find anything serious
enough to warrant any. I do, however, have some minor comments that the authors should be
able to address in a timely manner. My recommendation is to accept with minor revisions.
Minor comments
1) Review manuscript to ensure the past tense is being used. For example, line 82, “we investigate
…” where further in the paragraph the past tense is used.
12
2) Line 83 – it isn’t clear to me the purpose. I think the confusing part of the sentence is the
inclusion of the words after the colon.
3) More details needed on the HSB and LSB lines. For example, how long have they been
divergent (i.e., how many generations). What were the original parents (wild type?)? What was
the original selection experiment that assigned fish to the two lines?
4) 80 references is a bit much for a data focused paper.
5) Line 184 – should a reference be included?
6) The authors mention exposing zebrafish to a novel stressor. Unless I’m missing it, I didn’t see
in the methods why was used as the stressor.

Comments to the Author(s)
In this manuscript, the authors quantified the whole-body cortisol levels in zebrafish that show
different behaviours in novel tank diving test. The authors found differences in cortisol levels at 6
min between the animals that show „reactive“ vs. „proactive“ stress coping style as measured by
the amount of time they spent in upper vs. lower zones in a novel tank. The authors also
measured the differences in male vs. female zebrafish in their cortisol response.
The study addresses interesting question of the relationship between neuroendocrine stress
response and coping style. While the question itself is interesting, I do have several major issues
with this manuscript.
1. The authors conclude „differences in cortisol levels between the alternative stress coping styles
are not just restricted to magnitude but also extends to the temporal dynamics.“ However the
authors only analysed 3 time points, 0, 6, and 30 min and showed that there is a difference only at
6. In so far as the temporal dynamics is the only thing that is measured in this manuscript, it
would be important for authors to show more data points to demonstrate the actual temporal
dynamics. They need to complete the time points at 12, 18, and 24 in addition to 6 and 30 min to
show the peak values and the rate of decrease.
2. One important question is whether different cortisol temporal dynamics shown in this
manuscript is a general feature of selectively bred lines with different coping styles regardless of
stressor type. Authors should test the temporal dynamic of the cortisol response of the lines to at
least another stressor.
3. How reactive and proactive lines defined by the authors other behavioural criteria (such as
open field test) fare in the NTDT need to be shown. Do reactive lines always show significantly
more bottom-dwelling behaviour compared to the proactive lines? For this study, the authors
chose a reactive line fish if it spent greater than 151 seconds of the first 6 minutes. They also need
to show the cortisol temporal profile of reactive line fish that may not show such a pronounced
behaviour. Such a fish may classify as “reactive” according to other behavioural criteria. In short
a more comprehensive analysis is required to compare how reactive and proactive fish line
behaves overall in NTDT test. Also the authors need to compare the cortisol response of different
reactive and proactive fish and their behaviour in the NTDT not only the ones that show most
pronounced behavioural differences in novel tank.
4. Somewhat related to the point 3, both in abstract and in the text the authors mention that they
couldn’t find correlations between individual variation of cortisol levels and behaviour, but this
important point is not shown. The authors need to show this data and address the point of
individual variation.

: Differences in stress reactivity between zebrafish with alternative stress coping styles
viduals vary in their behavioral responses to stressful conditions and, in some cases, may show
sistent individual responses across contexts. The frameworks of 'behavioral syndromes' and 'animal
onality,' predict that it may be possible to categorize animals qualitatively by consistent behavioral
onses into 'proactive' and 'reactive' stress-coping styles. Despite these styles potentially
esenting only part of a broader spectrum of individual variation in behavior, and the expectation
such discrete behavioral phenotypes should only be expected when distinct adaptive behavioral
ks are present in the selective landscape, several studies have attempted to identify the genetic,
roendocrine, or endocrine differences between fish expressing 'proactive' or 'reactive' behavioral
notypes, with the ultimate goal of understanding the proximate mechanisms that underlie these
notypic differences.
manuscript describes the results of an experiment testing for differences in glucocorticoid stress
tivity profiles in 'proactive' and 'reactive' zebrafish (Danio rerio) using artificially-selected genetic
s that were bred to differ in behavioral responses to an acute stressor. Specifically, genetic lines had
n selected to show either high or low stationary behaviors during an 'open field assay' test. In this
y, the authors exposed these genetic lines of zebrafish to a 'Novel Tank' stressor test and then
rded their behavioral responses including the amount of time spent swimming/moving and the
tion of time spent within the bottom or top half of the tank. The authors then used that behavioral
to identify a subset of fish from each genetic line with consistent responses based on those
avioral measures, and therefore could be categorized into discrete 'proactive' or 'reactive' coping
es; fish that spent more than 151 s of the first 6 min in the bottom zone of the tank were classified as
ctive', while fish spending more than 151 s in the top zone of the tank were considered 'proactive.'
authors then sacrificed fish and measured whole-body cortisol levels to evaluate whether these
ctive' and 'proactive' fish difference in glucocorticoid reactivity to the 'novel tank' test.
rief, 'reactive' zebrafish were observed to have higher whole-body cortisol than 'proactive' fish 6 min
r exposure to the 'novel tank' test. Since 'reactive' and 'proactive' fish no longer differed in whole-
y cortisol 30 min after stressor exposure, these differences at 6 min suggest that the groups differ in
axis reactivity. The authors also observed a sex difference in whole-body cortisol response, with
es zebrafish having higher whole-body cortisol concentrations at the 6 min sampling time following
ssor exposure.
le the overall aim of this study - to test whether differences in the behavioral response to stressors
underlain by differences in reactivity of the HPI endocrine axis - the manuscript in its present form
uld be revised to clarify several issues. Those issues are outlined below.
or Issues (listed in order of importance for revision)
Baseline group. Individual zebrafish sampled at the 6 min and 30 min time points to generate
stress reactivity data were subsets of the High Stationary Behavior (HSB) and Low Stationary
avior (LSB) artificially-selected lines. Those subsets were fish identified as showing consistent
rences in depth preference in the 'novel tank' test (described in lines 118-126). Fish used for the
line time point, however, were haphazardly selected from home tanks holding fish of the HSB and
lines (lines 131-133), and did not appear to be the same subset of fish classified as 'proactive' or
ctive' based on the depth preferences. As such, the baseline fish are not a valid indicator of what
line whole-body cortisol levels would be in the 'proactive' and 'reactive' groups, as they were likely
clude a large scope of behavioral and (based on the author's hypothesis) neuroendocrine
notypic variation.
lly, the authors would have used previously identified 'proactive' and 'reactive' fish for the baseline
ple. Since this may not be possible at this time, the authors should revise Figures 1 and 2a to clearly
cate that the baseline fish are not equivalent to the 6 min and 30 min fish (perhaps by adding a
ed line between the baseline and 6 min samples, or gray shading the 0 min area of the plot).
larly, the statistical analyses should be conducted for the 6 min and 30 min alone, and a separate
ysis conducted for the two groups of baseline fish.
ommented by this and the other two reviewers, it is obvious that we were not clear in describing
lines and the use of the terminology of proactive and reactive groups. In our previous study
:10.1163/1568539X-00003018) we showed that differences in behavioral performance in the open
test (OFT) between the HSB and LSB lines are consistent across 5 other behavioral stress assays
uding the novel tank diving test (NTDT) used here). That is, on average individuals of the LSB lines
wed significantly lower amounts of stationary time in the OFT and significantly higher amounts of
e in the top half of the NTDT compared to individuals of the HSB lines. From several other studies
mining the behavioral consistency between and within individuals, molecular profiles, morphology
hese lines (DOIs: 10.1163/1568539X-00003018, 10.1186/1471-2164-14-348, 10.1186/s12864-015-
6-x, 10.1038/s41598-018-30630-3, 10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.04.007), and endocrine responses from
current study, we believe that on average each line exhibit characteristics of either the proactive
eactive stress coping styles as described in the literature. Hence in the manuscript we call any
vidual from the HSB line as having the reactive stress coping style and any individual from the LSB
as having the proactive stress coping style; the coping style is a general characteristic of the line.
pite the commonplace binary designation descriptor, it has been shown in the broader field of
mal personality types that there is inter-individual variation in behaviors within a personality type
stress coping style). However, on average the two differ in their responses. We have shown that
lines are consistent with the observation of showing between-individual variation of behavior
in a line but on average the two lines are significantly different from each other. Thus, we believe
proactive and reactive stress coping style descriptor is appropriate for any individual belonging to
LSB and HSB lines, respectively. We have included further description of our lines and justification
e use of the terms proactive and reactive stress coping style in the methodology (see lines 102-
).
reviewer makes an astute observation regarding the baseline fish. The baseline fish may certainly
esent individuals that do not have the same pronounced depth preferences in their respective
s. However, there is no feasible way to obtain such a comparable baseline group. As the reviewer
ted out, our methodology is such that we captured an individual from their home tank and
ediately tested the fish in the NTDT. Only if the fish met the criteria stated in the methods did we
ifice afterwards to examine the endocrine response. In other words, we did not pre-screen
viduals beforehand; we also may not be able to pre-screen them in the NTDT as this would reduce
novelty stressor part on a subsequent test in the same assay. We would like to note that we also
yed a random assortment of individuals from each line and measured cortisol levels at 6-minute
e point (see lines 128-131 of original submission). With those randomly selected individuals, we
larly saw (1) significantly higher cortisol levels in both the reactive (t(22) = -3.122, p = 0.051 * 10-
nd proactive (t(22) = -3.122, p = 0.005) line compared to baseline and (2) that the reactive line had
ificantly higher cortisol levels than the proactive line at the 6 minute time point (t(22) = 2.487, p =
1). There was also no significant difference in cortisol levels between the randomly selected
viduals and those behaviorally screened within each line at the 6 minute time point. We therefore
eve that inclusion of the baseline timepoint in the statistical model with the other time points is
d. In the revised manuscript we note the possibility of baseline fish being behaviorally different
those at the 6 and 30 minute time point in the discussion but we believe it does not alter our
lts and interpretations (lines 224-229).
Clarity of HSB/LSB versus proactive/reactive phenotypes. The authors need to revise the
uscript to make the distinction between these phenotypes more clear to the reader. If I understand
ectly, the genetic lines of zebrafish were artificially selected for HSB/LSB behaviors. The authors then
using those lines to identify individuals from each line showing 'extremes' of depth preference
notypes following stress, and are referring to those phenotypes as "proactive' (for select fish coming
the LSB line) and "reactive" (for select fish coming from the HSB line). That needs to be made more
r to the reader in a revised version of the manuscript. I think that this could be done by revising the
ences describing the experimental design (Lines 82-93). Part of the confusion arises because the
ors state that they are testing the HSB line versus the LSB line (see Lines 90-91, for instance), but
actually testing a particular phenotypic subset of the HSB line ("reactive" fish) versus a subset of LSB
("proactive" fish).
apologize for the confusion and have responded to this in our response to the first comment of
reviewer. In brief any fish from the HSB line is referred to as reactive and any fish from the LSB
is referred to as the proactive. We are not calling the extremes of each line as proactive or
tive. Rather they represent individuals of the proactive (LSB) and reactive (HSB) lines with the
t pronounced depth preference. We have added substantial text describing the lines in the
sed manuscript (lines 102-124).
Use of the term 'neuroendocrine.' At several places in the manuscript, the authors refer to their
y examining "neuroendocrine responses" (see lines 24, 82, 199, 206, etc.). However, the current
y looked at whole-body cortisol levels…which is not a neuroendocrine response, despite the HPI axis
taining neuroendocrine signaling components such as CRH/CRF. This needs to be revised throughout
manuscript. The response variable measured in the present study should just be referred to as
ocrine', given the data presented.
have changed the wording through to the more accurate terminology of “endocrine” as
ropriate.
or comments:
Lines 20-21. For clarity, perhaps revise to the following: "Animals experience stress in a variety
ontexts, and the behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to stress can vary among conspecifics."
Line 28. Which behaviors? Since the specific behavior of depth preference isn't described in the
tract, the reader has a difficult time evaluating the relevance of this manuscript to their own
rests/research.
Line 30. The term 'cortisol' release isn't really accurate here, as these are whole body cortisol
sures and not circulating. Hence, cortisol released from the interrenal is indistinguishable from
isol produced but not released. Please reword.
Line 42. Please add citations here.
Lines 68-69. The point made in this sentence should be made more explicitly: that circulating
isol concentrations may be influenced by several factors. Perhaps revise to: "Circulating cortisol
centrations also have been shown to vary with other factors including sex and recent behavioral
erience, and such factors can contribute to individual variation in the temporal responses of
ocorticoids following the perception of a stressor."
Lines 73-74. Revise to: "Other closely linked traits may also be selected indirectly."
Lines 80-81. This sentence is worded awkwardly. Please revise.
Line 83. Revise "selected to display divergent" to "selected for divergent"
Line 105. The stressor here in the Novel Tank Diving Test (NTDT) is just moving the fish to a
el tank, is that correct? Perhaps make this explicit in this sentence for readers unfamiliar with this
.
have made the suggested changes.
Lines 126-136. Please provide some number (n = ?) on how many fish were tested overall in
er to identify the fish used for cortisol sampling (aka, how many fish from each the HSB and LSB lines
e 'rejected' for not showing behaviors adhering to the "proactive" and "reactive" types as outlined in
s 118-128?)
tested a total of 44 reactive individuals and 219 proactive individuals. We have included the
ber of individuals that were “rejected” in the main text (line 151-152)
Lines 170-173. Were Pearson correlations run on all fish combined, or "reactive" and "proactive"
ps separately? Or both?
are grateful for the reviewer for this question. We originally just ran correlations with fish
bined but not separately. When analyzing separately, we observed that there was a significant
tive correlation between percent time spent in the upper zone and cortisol levels only in the
tive line. All other correlations run on the lines separately were not significant. We have revised
text to include these results (lines 31-32, 200, 359-381).
Line 197. It's also possible that the reactive line shows a difference in glucocorticoid clearance
. That should be mentioned as an alternative hypothesis here.
Line 206. The use of "neuroendocrine stress response" here should be revised to "HPA/HPI axis
ss response", given that the present cortisol data and other studies being referenced refer to
ulating glucocorticoids, and not hypothalamic-pituitary pathways.
have made the suggested changes.
Lines 206-208. This claim that reactive individuals have a fasted cortisol release rate doesn't
m to be well supported given the present data. Can the authors back this up further? Otherwise, the
ement is too speculative based on the data presented to this point in the manuscript and should be
sed. However, the date from reference [42], appears applicable here. Please revise.
appreciate the reviewer’s comment to limit description and interpretation to only what we
ed. As mentioned in response to another reviewer (see below), we did not originally intend our
y to be a comprehensive time-series analysis of the endocrine response but had a priori
ivations to select time points serving as a proxy for the rising and falling phases of the
ocorticoid stress response. We have now rephrased here and in other spots in the manuscript to
learer that we just see significantly different cortisol levels during the rising phase of the
ocorticoid stress response.
Line 235. Delete the extra "be" between "further" and "modulated"
Lines 236-237. Revise to "…differences in the duration.."
Lines 238-239. This phrase about coping styles and different fitness optima is speculative, so
uld be worded as such. Perhaps revise to the following: "It has been proposed that discrete coping
es may be maintained in a population…"
Line 251. By "strain" do you mean "line"? I don't think this term has been used previously in the
uscript. For clarity, please use "line" here in Line 251 and in Line 301.
Lines 252-254. For clarity, revise to: "Our observation of higher stress-induced cortisol
centrations in males than females was not expected. Instead, female-based elevation of post-
ssor cortisol levels has been seen across several taxa."
have made the suggested changes.
Lines 292-293. Do males of the HSB and LSB lines generally show greater movement? Is this
notypic difference seen even in the absence of partitioning HSB fish into "reactive" and "non-
tive" HSBs? Similar for LSBs?
have previously documented that in an earlier generation of the proactive and reactive lines,
es in both lines show greater movement than females.
Figure 1. The authors need to indicate whether these are mean +/- SEM values, or +/-SD for this and
other figures.
Table 1. It needs to be stated somewhere that these are p values being presented.
figures are +/- SEM values and we have included that in the figure legend. We also indicated on
e 1 that the numbers are p-values.

cism, I would have like to see physiological data related to more parts of the HPA axis (e.g., gene
onses of cortisol receptors). This would help to identify what parts of the pathway have been
nged (perhaps the authors are currently working on this). I typically do not have any “negative”
or comments, but I am at a lost to find anything serious enough to warrant any. I do, however, have
e minor comments that the authors should be able to address in a timely manner. My
mmendation is to accept with minor revisions.

The authors mention exposing zebrafish to a novel stressor. Unless I’m missing it, I didn’t see in

apologize for the confusion. The NTDT assay is itself the stressor (i.e. exposure to a novel

is manuscript, the authors quantified the whole-body cortisol levels in zebrafish that show different
aviours in novel tank diving test. The authors found differences in cortisol levels at 6 min between
animals that show „reactive“ vs. „proactive“ stress coping style as measured by the amount of time
spent in upper vs. lower zones in a novel tank. The authors also measured the differences in male
emale zebrafish in their cortisol response.
study addresses interesting question of the relationship between neuroendocrine stress response
coping style. While the question itself is interesting, I do have several major issues with this
uscript.
The authors conclude „differences in cortisol levels between the alternative stress coping styles
not just restricted to magnitude but also extends to the temporal dynamics.“ However the authors
analysed 3 time points, 0, 6, and 30 min and showed that there is a difference only at 6. In so far as
temporal dynamics is the only thing that is measured in this manuscript, it would be important for
ors to show more data points to demonstrate the actual temporal dynamics. They need to complete
time points at 12, 18, and 24 in addition to 6 and 30 min to show the peak values and the rate of
ease.
appreciate the reviewer pushing us to think more critically about the terminology used to describe
conclusions we draw from our study. We agree that having additional timepoints will result in a
e detailed view of the actual temporal dynamics and that the reviewer is inferring the use of the
mporal dynamics” descriptor is not appropriate for our manuscript. At the outset, our study was
designed to be a comprehensive examination of cortisol levels over time. Instead of examining the
monly used peak cortisol level time, we wanted to examine the cortisol levels during periods
esenting the rising (6 min) and recovery phases (30 min) of the glucocorticoid stress response in
afish. Hence, the inclusion of the additional time points would alter the original goal of our study.
ur substantially revised manuscript, we have modified text throughout to make the goals and
clusions of the study more accurately aligned with each other. Additionally, we use more precise
asing such as “changes in cortisol levels at time points occurring in the rising and falling phases of
glucocorticoid stress response” instead of “temporal dynamics” as appropriate.
One important question is whether different cortisol temporal dynamics shown in this
uscript is a general feature of selectively bred lines with different coping styles regardless of
ssor type. Authors should test the temporal dynamic of the cortisol response of the lines to at least
ther stressor.
is an insightful question by the reviewer. As with many studies examining cortisol stress
onses within a population, typically only one stressor is used in each study. Our results certainly
only be limited to the novelty stressor and not extend to other stressor types. It is outside the
e of this study to examine whether the cortisol response observed here is restricted to the
ssor used or if it is characteristic of all/other stressors (e.g. social stressor, food deprivation,
nic isolation, etc.). We hypothesize that the endocrine responses we observed are a general
ure due to the observation of consistent differences in behavior between the lines across multiple
ys. However, cortisol levels will need to be measured in response to other stressors. We have
ed this limitation in our revised manuscript (lines 272-275).
How reactive and proactive lines defined by the authors other behavioural criteria (such as open
test) fare in the NTDT need to be shown. Do reactive lines always show significantly more bottom-
lling behaviour compared to the proactive lines? For this study, the authors chose a reactive line fish
spent greater than 151 seconds of the first 6 minutes. They also need to show the cortisol temporal
ile of reactive line fish that may not show such a pronounced behaviour. Such a fish may classify as
ctive” according to other behavioural criteria. In short a more comprehensive analysis is required to
pare how reactive and proactive fish line behaves overall in NTDT test. Also the authors need to
pare the cortisol response of different reactive and proactive fish and their behaviour in the NTDT
only the ones that show most pronounced behavioural differences in novel tank.
reviewer asks important questions that we think also overlaps with concerns brought up by the
er reviewers. We believe the confusion is due to our lack of thoroughness in summarizing what we
others have published regarding our lines and our use of the terms proactive and reactive. As
ed in response to another reviewer we have generated two selectively bred lines of zebrafish
ting from wild caught individuals. These lines were generated by selectively breeding groups of
viduals displaying high stationary behavior in an open field test with each other and those with
stationary behavior together. We identify individuals that meet this criteria in each generation to
duce the next generation (see doi:10.1163/1568539X-00003018 for more details). Hence, the fish
d in our study have been selectively bred in this manner for 9 consecutive generations.
ur previous study (doi:10.1163/1568539X-00003018) we showed that differences in behavioral
ormance in the OFT between the HSB and LSB lines are consistent across 5 other behavioral stress
ys (including the NTDT used here). That is, individuals of the HSB line displayed more risk-averse
aviors relative to individuals from the LSB line across 5 other assays. More pertinent to the
ewer’s point, individuals of the LSB lines showed significantly lower amounts of stationary time in
OFT and significantly higher amounts of time in the top half of the NTDT compared to individuals
he HSB lines on average. We refer the reviewer to this previous study for a more thorough
acterization of the behaviors of both lines and sexes in the NTDT (and 5 other behavioral assays).
m several other studies examining the behavioral consistency, molecular profiles, and morphology
hese lines (DOIs: 10.1163/1568539X-00003018, 10.1186/1471-2164-14-348, 10.1186/s12864-015-
6-x, 10.1038/s41598-018-30630-3, 10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.04.007), we have multiple lines of
ence to suggest that the LSB and HSB lines exhibit characteristics of the proactive or reactive
ss coping styles, respectively, as described in the literature (sensu DOIs:
016/j.yfrne.2010.04.001, 10.1016/j.tree.2004.04.009, 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2006.10.006). Hence,
e manuscript we call any individual from the HSB line as having the reactive stress coping style
any individual from the LSB line as having the proactive stress coping style. As we have shown in
er studies and in the data seen in the current manuscript, our lines certainly have variation within
e. However as mentioned above, on average the two lines differ in numerous behavioral,
ecular, and morphological characteristics consistent with the either the proactive or reactive
ss coping style. We have added substantial text that further describes our previous studies using
e lines and how these lines are generated and maintained (102-124).
fish chosen for our data represent the “extreme” ends of the spectrum within each of our HSB
ctive) and LSB (proactive) lines. As mentioned in the methods, this was done under the
mption that these individuals would have the most robust glucocorticoid responses. We
reciate the reviewer’s suggestion that the results observed here may only be limited to those on
extreme end of each line or perhaps represents a state response (rather than a trait). We too were
cerned of this possibility. As such we tested individuals of each line that did not undergo any time
ria (they were randomly selected) for 6 minutes in the NTDT (see lines 224-229). We still observed
nificant difference in cortisol with the reactive (HSB) individuals having significantly higher
isol levels than the proactive (LSB) individuals. Further these individuals did not show any
ificant difference in cortisol levels with those who were behaviorally screened at the 6 minute
e point. Hence, we have evidence to suggest that the glucocorticoid responses are a general trait
he line and not representative of a subpopulation.
Somewhat related to the point 3, both in abstract and in the text the authors mention that they
dn’t find correlations between individual variation of cortisol levels and behaviour, but this
ortant point is not shown. The authors need to show this data and address the point of individual
ation.
entioned in reviewer #1 response, we originally ran the correlations on both lines combined. At
suggestion of reviewer #1 we also ran correlations on the lines separately. When analyzing
arately, we observed that there was a significant positive correlation between percent time spent
e upper zone and cortisol levels only in the reactive line. All other correlations run on the lines
arately were not significant. We have revised the text to include these results (lines 31-32, 200,
-381). We also now include a figure of these results (Figure 4).
