Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper. I believe that the topic is appropriate to the
journal and that the paper is overall well written. That said, there are several gaps that make the
paper difficult to evaluate. First, I think that the method is a bit unclear. The problem may be that
the authors are relying on the readers to have read their previous work, but since we cannot rely
on readers to do that a lot of details are missing that make it difficult to interpret what was
actually done. For example, I have no idea what the four syllables used were and where they
came from. Nor do I understand how the pictures and syllables were aligned. Did the onset of the
target syllable align with the onset of the picture? I know when it ended, but not when it began.
You say that playback with initiated synchronously with the image, but do you mean the syllable
or the utterance? If you mean the syllable, then temporal synchrony would be a cue to word
learning, but if you mean the utterance then it's only sometimes a cue to word learning. You see
why I am confused here?
A second concern is that I feel as if you are reading into the literature a bit too much. The
literature you cite really has very little to say about which mechanisms might facilitate word
extraction or word learning at sentence edges. You talk about about recency/primacy, but the
advantage found for edge words in the literature could just as much be acoustically related (e.g.,
words at edges are louder or longer). In fact your results seem to suggest both factors play a role,
so why not mention at the outset that the literature on the topic is actually pretty agnostic here.
All they find is an advantage for learning or segmentation from IDS and edge words and its not
clear *why* they find this. One advantage your study has is that you attempt to tease these apart.
That's a solid contribution that I think is worth stating early on. More details on this can be found
in smaller comments below:
3, 30 I would be careful about the "hyperarticulated vowels" thing. Much recent work seems to
call this result into question (e.g., Martin et al., Mcmurray et al., Seidl & Cristia, etc...)
3, 32-33 You cite Filippi et al, but you should also cite Ma, Golinkoff, Houston & Hirsh-Pasek
(2011) here since I think this is the first study showing this finding.
3, 39-40 Actually Seidl and Johnson (2006, 2008) didn't really find anything about salience or
"processing", they just found that infants segmented words better at edges than sentence-
internally. This effect *could* have been due to salience, but their work doesn't really tease out
the causes of this effect or whether it was cognitive bias (e.g., recency) or something more
acoustically-driven (e.g., initial strengthening).
5, 20 It is worthy of note that cross-modal statistical learning may be challenging for children
(e.g., Thiessen, 2010). Also, I'm a bit confused about the method. Were the picture and the
syllable temporally aligned such that e.g., the onset of the tree was coincident with the onset of
the playing of FU? In general the method is very unclear. You say four syllables, but which 4
syllables?

This paper examines children’s abilities to learn new words in a cross-situational learning
paradigm using artificial lexicons and grammars. During training, subjects heard four-word
sentences. Only one of the words is the intended referent for the displayed image. Four groups of
8-year olds are tested, with the cues to word learning (word image co-occurrence probability
only, co-occurrence probability + pitch contrast, co-occurrence probability + target word position,
and co-occurrence probability + pitch contrast + target word position) manipulated across
groups. It was found that co-occurrence probability alone was insufficient for word learning in
this procedure and that children require at least one additional cue to perform above chance.
However, only performance of those children who heard all cues combined differed from that of
children receiving probability information alone. The authors conclude that only the combination
of cues boosts children’s success in this task.
The researchers argue that while much research has focused infants’ abilities to learn novel
words, school-age children’s word learning skills are understudied. I agree, and believe that this
work could help address this gap in the literature. However, I do have some concerns about the
manuscript, outlined in detail below. I also thought I should indicate that I could not access the
data from the website listed in the manuscript.
1. The introduction is very sparse and only highlights parts of the research question.
Restructuring and expanding the introduction could increase the impact of this paper.
Specifically, it would be helpful to discuss the available evidence of cross-situational learning.
Restructuring the description of the word learning cues could be useful as well. The current
description appears to include a somewhat random selection of cues, and it is currently unclear
which cues might be beneficial for which aspects of word learning. Could the authors be more
specific here?
2. While a difference was found between children in the control condition and children in
the pitch peak & utterance final condition, no differences were observed between any other two
conditions. If participants were spread evenly across conditions (please indicate if this is the
case), then that would mean that there were 14 children per condition. Was a power analysis
conducted to ensure that this is a high enough number? In other words, can we be relatively
certain that the lack of other differences is not due to insufficient power?
3. To what extent are the error bars on Figure 2 informative? The statistical analyses
indicate that this condition differs from chance, yet the error bar displaying the confidence
interval crosses the 33%-line.
4. In the General Discussion, the authors conclude that children differ from adults in that
they need more than one cue for successful word learning. At the same time, however, word
learning was statistically above chance in these conditions.
5. Relatedly, could the overall difference between children and adults be due to children’s
reduced cognitive resources? In other words, might children have performed at levels
4
comparable to adults (or at least above chance in the control condition) if had the task been easier,
the pronunciations of the words more variable, or the training phase longer?
6. Would it be possible that children have no trouble learning these words but experience
difficulty generalising their learned words to novel exemplars? Could this be distinguished from
their ability to learn word-object pairs by using the images used during training (but novel test
sentences) at test?
7. Please clarify description of the materials. Are the transitional probabilities between
“words” identical for target words and non-target words? Are they identical across conditions? Is
the combination of the syllables more likely to be perceived as a sentence or as a word? Were test
sentences identical for children tested on the same target word sets, even if the word-image
associations differed?
8. While I could generally follow most of the paper, the manuscript contains quite some
language errors and idiosyncrasies (especially in the introduction). I have noted some of those
below, but would recommend to have it proofread by a native English speaker prior to
publication.
Other comments:
• Abstract, line 11: Was the target word varied or the position of the target word?
• Abstract, line 12 and 16-17: Please consider “with a different pitch contrast” instead of
“with a pitch differential contrast.”
• Abstract, line 13-14 and line 15-16: Please delete “the” from “occurred at the utterance-
final position” and replace “at” with “in.”
• Abstract: If possible I would avoid numbering the conditions. The meaning of the
penultimate sentence of the abstract only became clear to me after having read the full paper.
• Abstract, final sentence: I would consider rewriting this sentence and focus more on the
benefit of combining pitch and location information.
• Introduction, page 3, line 6-7: “employ” may not be the best word here.
• Introduction, page 3, line 9-10: I wouldn’t consider “storing” to be part of “extracting”.
• Introduction, page 3, line 10-11: This assumes all words have referents in the visual
scene, which is not necessarily true (grammatical words, for instance, might not directly map
onto visual information).
• Introduction, page 3, line 35-36: “pitch differential contrast” sounds strange to me. Please
consider rephrasing this.
• Introduction, page 3, line 38-39: Please change “also can” by “can also.”
• Introduction, page 3, reference 32-33: Please add a reference of primacy and recency
effects in children. I would also replace “priming effects” by “serial position effects.”
• Introduction, page 3, line 46: Please consider replacing “focusing” by “allocating.”
• Introduction, page 3, line 61: “on the final edge” sounds strange.
• Participants: Please provide the age range. Were all participants typically developing
children? Why were 8- to 9-year olds recruited rather than any other age group?
• Materials, line 51-52: “In order to […] to other children”: Please consider rephrasing.
• Materials, page 5, line 4-5: “Each word’s intensity was adjusted to mean 69.97 dB (SD =
.08) relative to peak amplitude.” I am not quite sure what this means. Do the authors mean that
the maximum intensity was 69.97 dB? Also, please describe how the PSOLA procedure alters the
signal.
• Materials: The pitch level measures would fit better in the materials section.
• Learning conditions, line 31: Please rephrase “a large magnitude cross-linguistically
typical of IDS.”
• Training and test procedure, line 55-56: Please replace “in order to familiarize with” by
“in order to familiarize themselves with.”
• Training and test procedure, page 6, line 16-19: From the description, I understand that
the auditory materials at test were different from those during training. However, I do not see
how each utterance being associated with a set of three probe images yields 36 (or any other
number of) trials.

• Discussion: Could the authors speculate as to what would happen in the case other (i.e.
non-target) words are prosodically marked or when target words occur sentence-initially.
• Discussion: To what extent do we know that utterance-final target words can be helpful
(in combination with pitch contrasts) due to serial position reasons rather than statistical
probability reasons?
• Discussion, line 55-56: I am not sure how this study shows that children exploit pitch
enhancement and sentence-final word position as cues that mark visual categories?
• Discussion, line 56-60: Please rephrase this sentence. It seems to me that these findings
align with previous work underlining the importance of utterance edges, but they do not speak to
phonotactic and phonological rule learning.

The paper is much improved. I just have a few minor comments below.
4, 145 "only little research" --> little research
9, 389 "In fact, our results complement previous
findings on word learning, showing that processing multiple sources of information (e.g.
unfamiliar,
but statistically regular phonetic variations and word-objects associations) at the same time is
challenging for infants (48,62)." I don't get this at all. First, neither of these studies cited is a word
learning study. Second, yes, you could say that learning from multiple input streams can be
challenging for infants (though see Seidl et al., 2014 where it can be helpful), but then in the next
sentence you say these multiple cues help children (with no supporting evidence from other
work saying cues from multiple domains can be helpful). So which one is it? Do you want to say
that (a) multiple cues can be hard for babies, but is easier for older children (but not adults) or (b)
that multiple cues are hard for everyone or (c) that multiple cues are actually helpful when they
support learning structure. Point being, somehow your point is totally lost here and I think this
section just needs to be rewritten. It's complex because the data that you cite seems to suggest
that multiple cues are hard for adults and for infants, but maybe not for kids (your study). But I
also think that perhaps you are oversimplifying the data here because there is a literature
showing that multiple cues can be helpful to learning when there is e.g. redundancy across two
modalities (e.g., Bahrick and Lickliter's work).

In general, I believe this revised manuscript has substantially improved, and most of my earlier
concerns have been addressed. One remaining issue, though, is the sample size. In their response,
the authors argue that the finding that one group is different from control means that their power
is sufficient for all of their comparisons. This does not necessarily have to be the case. It seems
quite plausible that the size of the effect may be different for each comparison (perhaps indicative
of a stepwise pattern), and that comparisons of the two intermediate conditions to the control
group require a greater sample size to ensure a similar power level. The authors also argue that
they do not conclude that there is no difference between levels where no significant differences
were observed, but it seems to me that a conclusion such as “Hence, our data indicate that
performance in this EIM task is significantly boosted only when the two cues (words’ pitch
enhancement and utterance-position) are combined” (line 364-366) makes that inference.
Relatedly, the authors argue that the 95% confidence intervals show an overlap between the
Control and the other conditions (except the Pitch Peak + utterance final condition) and that this
confirms their findings. First, given that the confidence interval is dependent on the sample size
(with fewer subjects displaying a consistent pattern leading to larger confidence intervals), this
cannot really be considered a confirmation. Second, an overlap in confidence intervals between
conditions does not necessarily mean that there are no differences between those conditions.
Minor concerns:
Line 97: Please consider using “are subjected to” instead of “use.”
Line 110: Even lexical words (e.g. abstract nouns (love, gratitude); certain verbs (infer, hear);
certain adjectives (smart, tolerant) may not have clear referents in the visual scene.
Line 128: “Research suggests that the general property of primacy and recency in memory
abilities may focus attention on words at the edges of an utterance in infants (37–39) and adults
(36).” How does this align with the argument made later in the paragraph that this might either
be due to serial position or to prosodic modifications? Doesn’t research simply suggest that
attention is more easily directed toward the edges of utterances?
Line 131-133: “Although cognitive bias to the edges of utterances might be related to prosodic
modifications such as initial strengthening and final lengthening of words at utterance
boundaries” Would a greater tendency to learn from the edges of phrases as a result of prosodic
modifications be better described as greater attention to prosodically salient items?
12
Line 138-141: What does it mean for statistical regularities (and eye gaze) to “orient”
categorization of visual objects or object-word associations? Do they authors mean “guide”?
Line 141: How does the claim that prosody guides infants’ attention in label-referent mapping
scenarios relate to the claim that statistical patterns do? Are they simply different cues that could
affect what is paid attention to?
Line 173-174: Please provide the number of excluded children.
Line 310: “They could thus make their choice from the end of the auditory stimulus playback to
up to 4 s after the sound ended.” How would this work if the image remained on screen for only
1500 ms after the end of the sound?
Line 373-376: “suggesting that recency effects alone may not be sufficient to ease word
segmentation” It seems to me that it is currently unclear what process drives the observed effect
in this study. That is, while serial position and pitch contour might have affected segmentation, it
might also have affected word object-label mapping.

Comments to the Author:
Thank you for submitting your work to the RSOS.
Two reviewers who reviewed the previous version of your manuscript have evaluated this
revised version. Both reviewers indicate that they are pleased with the way you have addressed
their final concerns, and I am therefore happy to recommend that your manuscript be accepted,
assuming that the final minor remaining issues that each reviewer highlights can be addressed. In
particular, Reviewer 2 notes that some conclusions should be more carefully articulated in order
to more accurately reflect the limitations of what the current data set (i.e., with a relatively small
sample size) can actually support.

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper is much improved. I just have a few minor comments below.
15
4, 145 "only little research" --> little research
9, 389 "In fact, our results complement previous
findings on word learning, showing that processing multiple sources of information (e.g.
unfamiliar,
but statistically regular phonetic variations and word-objects associations) at the same time is
challenging for infants (48,62)." I don't get this at all. First, neither of these studies cited is a word
learning study. Second, yes, you could say that learning from multiple input streams can be
challenging for infants (though see Seidl et al., 2014 where it can be helpful), but then in the next
sentence you say these multiple cues help children (with no supporting evidence from other
work saying cues from multiple domains can be helpful). So which one is it? Do you want to say
that (a) multiple cues can be hard for babies, but is easier for older children (but not adults) or (b)
that multiple cues are hard for everyone or (c) that multiple cues are actually helpful when they
support learning structure. Point being, somehow your point is totally lost here and I think this
section just needs to be rewritten. It's complex because the data that you cite seems to suggest
that multiple cues are hard for adults and for infants, but maybe not for kids (your study). But I
also think that perhaps you are oversimplifying the data here because there is a literature
showing that multiple cues can be helpful to learning when there is e.g. redundancy across two
modalities (e.g., Bahrick and Lickliter's work).

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
In general, I believe this revised manuscript has substantially improved, and most of my earlier
concerns have been addressed. One remaining issue, though, is the sample size. In their response,
the authors argue that the finding that one group is different from control means that their power
is sufficient for all of their comparisons. This does not necessarily have to be the case. It seems
quite plausible that the size of the effect may be different for each comparison (perhaps indicative
of a stepwise pattern), and that comparisons of the two intermediate conditions to the control
group require a greater sample size to ensure a similar power level. The authors also argue that
they do not conclude that there is no difference between levels where no significant differences
were observed, but it seems to me that a conclusion such as “Hence, our data indicate that
performance in this EIM task is significantly boosted only when the two cues (words’ pitch
enhancement and utterance-position) are combined” (line 364-366) makes that inference.
Relatedly, the authors argue that the 95% confidence intervals show an overlap between the
Control and the other conditions (except the Pitch Peak + utterance final condition) and that this
confirms their findings. First, given that the confidence interval is dependent on the sample size
(with fewer subjects displaying a consistent pattern leading to larger confidence intervals), this
cannot really be considered a confirmation. Second, an overlap in confidence intervals between
conditions does not necessarily mean that there are no differences between those conditions.
Minor concerns:
Line 97: Please consider using “are subjected to” instead of “use.”
Line 110: Even lexical words (e.g. abstract nouns (love, gratitude); certain verbs (infer, hear);
certain adjectives (smart, tolerant) may not have clear referents in the visual scene.
Line 128: “Research suggests that the general property of primacy and recency in memory
abilities may focus attention on words at the edges of an utterance in infants (37–39) and adults
(36).” How does this align with the argument made later in the paragraph that this might either
be due to serial position or to prosodic modifications? Doesn’t research simply suggest that
attention is more easily directed toward the edges of utterances?
Line 131-133: “Although cognitive bias to the edges of utterances might be related to prosodic
modifications such as initial strengthening and final lengthening of words at utterance
16
boundaries” Would a greater tendency to learn from the edges of phrases as a result of prosodic
modifications be better described as greater attention to prosodically salient items?

categorization of visual objects or object-word associations? Do they authors mean “guide”?
Line 141: How does the claim that prosody guides infants’ attention in label-referent mapping

Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper. I believe that the topic is
appropriate to the journal and that the paper is overall well written. That said,
there are several gaps that make the paper difficult to evaluate. First, I think
that the method is a bit unclear. The problem may be that the authors are
relying on the readers to have read their previous work, but since we cannot
rely on readers to do that a lot of details are missing that make it difficult to
nterpret what was actually done. For example, I have no idea what the four
syllables used were
We apologize for the lack of clarity in our initial submission of the manuscript. In
he supplementary material section, we have now included Table 1, which lists all
he utterances we used in our experiment in both training and test phases, and
across conditions. In addition, we have substantially edited section „Sounds“
starting on line 198) in Material and Methods.
and where they came from.
As we now explain in lines 201-203: “ The CV syllables came from a pool of five
vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and twelve consonants, namely four stops (p, t, k, g), four
ricatives (f, v, s, sh) and four sonorants (m, n, l, r).” In line 198 we now specify
hat our language was invented.
Nor do I understand how the pictures and syllables were aligned. Did the
onset of the target syllable align with the onset of the picture? I know when
t ended, but not when it began.
Following this comment, we now rephrased this part of the introduction, which
now reads as follows: “For each slide, the onset of the utterance was aligned with
he onset of image presentation. Consequently, only in the control and pitch peak
conditions, where the target word’s position was varied systematically across each
utterance, onset of the target word coincided with onset of image presentation in
9 out of 36 trials.” (lines 297-300)
You say that playback with initiated synchronously with the image, but do
you mean the syllable or the utterance? If you mean the syllable, then
temporal synchrony would be a cue to word learning, but if you mean the
utterance then it's only sometimes a cue to word learning. You see why I am
confused here?
We apologize for the confusion. Indeed, we refer to the playback of the four-
word utterance. In addition to the paragraph cited in the previous reply, in order
o avoid confusion between the terms “utterance” (which could in principle refer
o a monosyllabic word and to a four-word sentence), “target word” or “syllable”,
n lines 198-199, we now clarify that with the term “utterance” we refer to a string
of four words.
A second concern is that I feel as if you are reading into the literature a bit
too much. The literature you cite really has very little to say about which
mechanisms might facilitate word extraction or word learning at sentence
edges. You talk about about recency/primacy, but the advantage found for
edge words in the literature could just as much be acoustically related (e.g.,
words at edges are louder or longer). In fact your results seem to suggest
both factors play a role, so why not mention at the outset that the literature
on the topic is actually pretty agnostic here. All they find is an advantage for
earning or segmentation from IDS and edge words and its not clear *why*
they find this.
Thank you for this excellent suggestion. We have now highlighted this point (lines
131-136): “Although cognitive bias to the edges of utterances might be related to
prosodic modifications such as initial strengthening and final lengthening of
words at utterance boundaries (39), very little attention has been paid to the role
of prosodic modulation of the target words in word learning. Another explanation
might be that serial position effects such as recency or primacy seen in studies on
working memory and implicit learning (42,43) facilitate word segmentation and
storing“
One advantage your study has is that you attempt to tease these apart. That's
a solid contribution that I think is worth stating early on.
We now emphasize the contribution of our work in this respect (lines 152-156): “
n the present work, we disentangled, for the first time, the relative effect of two
critical cues on word learning, prosody and position of the target words in a
sentence, within a cross-situational statistical word-learning task. Specifically, we
ested the prediction that pitch enhancement typical of IDS and word position at
he final edge of utterances significantly support word learning across multiple
visual contexts, both alone and when combined. ”
More details on this can be found in smaller comments below:
3, 30 I would be careful about the "hyperarticulated vowels" thing. Much
recent work seems to call this result into question (e.g., Martin et al.,
Mcmurray et al., Seidl & Cristia, etc...)
We have now added these references in line 124.
3, 32-33 You cite Filippi et al, but you should also cite Ma, Golinkoff, Houston
& Hirsh-Pasek (2011) here since I think this is the first study showing this
finding.
Please note that while Filippi et al 2014 addressed the role of IDS acoustic
parameters in facilitating word learning in adults, Ma, Golinkoff, Houston & Hirsh-
Pasek (2011) addressed the role of IDS in children’s word learning process. We
have now added this reference in lines 144 (Introduction) and 384 (Discussion), in
he context of research on the positive effects of IDS in children’s word learning.
3, 39-40 Actually Seidl and Johnson (2006, 2008) didn't really find anything
about salience or "processing", they just found that infants segmented words
better at edges than sentence-internally. This effect *could* have been due to
salience, but their work doesn't really tease out the causes of this effect or
whether it was cognitive bias (e.g., recency) or something more acoustically-
driven (e.g., initial strengthening).
We have now edited the description of findings from Seidl and Johnson (2006)
according to this comment (lines 129-136). As reported in the related response
above, we have highlighted the significance of our study in shedding light onto
he relative effect of memory constraints and of acoustic modifications (lines 152-
156).
5, 20 It is worthy of note that cross-modal statistical learning may be
challenging for children (e.g., Thiessen, 2010).
Following this comment, we now discuss how our findings complement previous
indings showing that using multiple sources of information may be challenging
or children (lines 386-394): “ In fact, our results complement previous findings on
word learning, showing that processing multiple sources of information (e.g.
unfamiliar, but statistically regular phonetic variations and word-objects
associations) at the same time is challenging for infants (48,62). Our data suggest
hat for school-age children, the combination of specific cues aiding memory and
enhancing word perception – namely cross-situational statistical regularities
between acoustic signal and visual image, pitch enhancement and utterance final
position - facilitate word learning. More work will be needed to explore the
combination of other types of cues enhancing the target word (e.g. word
engthening, or vowel hyperarticulation) with word position in utterances within a
cross-situational word-learning task. ”
Also, I'm a bit confused about the method. Were the picture and the syllable
temporally aligned such that e.g., the onset of the tree was coincident with
the onset of the playing of FU? In general the method is very unclear.
As we now clarify in lines 307-308, the onset of four-word utterance was aligned
with the onset of images presentation. In other words, the temporal alignment
was between the (four-word) utterances and the image presentation.
You say four syllables, but which 4 syllables?
We have now added Table 1 (as supplementary Material), listing all the
utterances we used in our experiment in both training and test phases, and across
conditions.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
This paper examines children’s abilities to learn new words in a cross-
situational learning paradigm using artificial lexicons and grammars. During
training, subjects heard four-word sentences. Only one of the words is the
ntended referent for the displayed image. Four groups of 8-year olds are
tested, with the cues to word learning (word image co-occurrence probability
only, co-occurrence probability + pitch contrast, co-occurrence probability +
target word position, and co-occurrence probability + pitch contrast + target
word position) manipulated across groups. It was found that co-occurrence
probability alone was insufficient for word learning in this procedure and that
children require at least one additional cue to perform above chance.
However, only performance of those children who heard all cues combined
differed from that of children receiving probability information alone. The
authors conclude that only the combination of cues boosts children’s success
n this task.
The researchers argue that while much research has focused infants’ abilities
to learn novel words, school-age children’s word learning skills are
understudied. I agree, and believe that this work could help address this gap
n the literature. However, I do have some concerns about the manuscript,
outlined in detail below.
We have thoroughly addressed the reviewer’s criticisms, paying special attention
o clarity in presentation of background studies. We provided more fine-tuned
nformation on materials and methods, with the aim to enable the replication of
his study. Please find our detailed responses below.

1. The introduction is very sparse and only highlights parts of the research
question. Restructuring and expanding the introduction could increase the impact of
his paper. Specifically, it would be helpful to discuss the available evidence of cross-
situational learning.
Following this suggestion, we have now expanded the introduction, providing
more information on cross-situational processes underpinning word learning and
we have added references to research on this topic (lines 97-111).
Restructuring the description of the word learning cues could be useful as
well. The current description appears to include a somewhat random selection
of cues, and it is currently unclear which cues might be beneficial for which
aspects of word learning. Could the authors be more specific here?
We have included a more detailed description of empirical evidence on each of
he three processes involved in word learning (word segmentation, inferring one
or more possible referents within the visual scene, and word-referent mapping)
and the cues affecting each of these processes (lines 119-151).
2. While a difference was found between children in the control condition
and children in the pitch peak & utterance final condition, no differences
were observed between any other two conditions. If participants were spread
evenly across conditions (please indicate if this is the case), then that would
mean that there were 14 children per condition.
Yes, 14 participants were tested in each learning condition. This information has
now been added in lines 258-259.
Was a power analysis conducted to ensure that this is a high enough
number? In other words, can we be relatively certain that the lack of other
differences is not due to insufficient power?
Our aim was to draw conclusions from a census of third graders of one (actually
he largest) elementary school in Vienna, so no power analysis was performed to
determine the optimal sample size. Our analyses revealed significant differences
between groups (at the alpha = 0.05 significance level). In addition, please note
hat the 95% confidence intervals indicated in Figure 2 confirm our findings,
showing an overlap between the Control Condition and all other conditions,
except the Pitch Peak + Utterance-final condition. We are certainly aware that a
ack of significance does not mean that there is actually no difference between
evels. Consequently, such conclusions were not drawn in the paper.
3. To what extent are the error bars on Figure 2 informative? The
statistical analyses indicate that this condition differs from chance, yet the
error bar displaying the confidence interval crosses the 33%-line.
Thank you for this crucial remark. The previous graph was erroneously created by
calculating the percentage of correct responses over 36 trials, i.e. over the total
number of test trials included in the design. This was a mistake: the graph did not
match the analyses we performed within the generalized linear model, where we
ncluded only trials in which participants provided a response, i.e. the number of
otal trials minus timeouts. We did not include timeouts since they could not be
analyzed neither as correct or incorrect responses. This is now explained in lines
322-323, 331-333. We have fixed the graph accordingly (Figure 2).
4. In the General Discussion, the authors conclude that children differ
from adults in that they need more than one cue for successful word
earning. At the same time, however, word learning was statistically above
chance in these conditions.
Following this comment, we have rephrased this paragraph: “ It can be argued
hat, in contrast to word learning in adults, word learning in school-age children
s significantly boosted only when multiple cues and/or salient perceptual
modifications mark target words” (lines 384-386).
5. Relatedly, could the overall difference between children and adults be
due to children’s reduced cognitive resources? In other words, might children
have performed at levels comparable to adults (or at least above chance in
the control condition) if had the task been easier, the pronunciations of the
words more variable, or the training phase longer?
Yes, it may be the case that overall difference between children and adults stems
rom children’s reduced cognitive resources. We now address this issue in lines
383-384.
6. Would it be possible that children have no trouble learning these words
but experience difficulty generalising their learned words to novel exemplars?
Could this be distinguished from their ability to learn word-object pairs by
using the images used during training (but novel test sentences) at test?
ndeed, this is a question that our study, which specifically focuses on word
earning, as defined in lines 109-118, 177-178 leaves unanswered. We address this
point as suggestion for future work in lines 401-405.
7. Please clarify description of the materials. Are the transitional
probabilities between “words” identical for target words and non-target
words? Are they identical across conditions?
Following this valuable comment, in lines 211-220, we now explain: “ All non-
arget words were systematically shared across utterances of the three semantic
categories, and therefore had no consistent referential link to the visual stimuli
Table 1). Within each learning condition, all non-target words were identical and
systematically occurred in the same position across semantic categories. Consider,
or instance, the utterance “loFUsheti”. The “lo” and “sheti” parts of the utterance
occurred also within the utterances “loGAsheti” and “loMIsheti”. Hence, only the
monosyllabic words shared within each semantic set of utterances constituted
arget words mappable to a specific visual semantic category. Across learning
conditions, within each semantic category, forward transitional probabilities
between monosyllabic words, i.e. the probability of one word given the
occurrence of the preceding word within each utterance, were 0, .25 or .50.”
n line 394-396 of the discussion, we now suggest future work related to this
opic: “ Crucially, further work disentangling the role of statistical regularities
within the utterances and the relative contribution of other learning cues is
suggested.”
s the combination of the syllables more likely to be perceived as a sentence
or as a word?
Since there was no coarticulation between syllables (line 226-227), each syllable
was more likely to be perceived as a word. Following this comment, we have now
ncluded sound samples for each condition in the supplementary materials.
Were test sentences identical for children tested on the same target word
sets, even if the word-image associations differed?
Yes, test utterances were the same for all participants within each learning
condition. This has now been added in lines 313-314.
8. While I could generally follow most of the paper, the manuscript
contains quite some language errors and idiosyncrasies (especially in the
ntroduction). I have noted some of those below, but would recommend to
have it proofread by a native English speaker prior to publication.
The last author, who is an English native speaker has proof-read and approved
he last version of the manuscript.
Other comments:
• Abstract, line 11: Was the target word varied or the position of the
target word?
The target word’s position was varied systematically within each utterance. This
has now been fixed.
• Abstract, line 12 and 16-17: Please consider “with a different pitch
contrast” instead of “with a pitch differential contrast.”
We now use the terms “pitch contrasts typical of infant-directed speech”, rather
han “with a different pitch contrast typical of infant-directed speech”. We believe
his phrasing is simpler and more effective in conveying information. We now use
“pitch contrast” rather than “pitch differential contrast” also in the main text.
• Abstract, line 13-14 and line 15-16: Please delete “the” from “occurred
at the utterance-final position” and replace “at” with “in.”
This has been fixed.
• Abstract: If possible I would avoid numbering the conditions. The
meaning of the penultimate sentence of the abstract only became clear to me
after having read the full paper.
We now refer to each learning condition by their names (as described in section
2.3 „Learning conditions“). Please note that as a matter of consistency throughout
he manuscript, we have also changed the order of condition presentation in the
abstract, keeping it the same as in the description outlined in section „Learning
conditions“.
• Abstract, final sentence: I would consider rewriting this sentence and
focus more on the benefit of combining pitch and location information.
We have now rephrased this sentence as follows: “ We conclude that, for school-
age children, the combination of words’ utterance-final alignment and pitch
enhancement boosts word learning.”
• Introduction, page 3, line 6-7: “employ” may not be the best word here.
We have substituted “employ” with “use”
• Introduction, page 3, line 9-10: I wouldn’t consider “storing” to be part
of “extracting”.
We agree. We now refer to “storing” as separate from “extracting” (lines 110-111).
• Introduction, page 3, line 10-11: This assumes all words have referents
n the visual scene, which is not necessarily true (grammatical words, for
nstance, might not directly map onto visual information).
n lines 110-111, we now specify that we refer to lexical word learning.
• Introduction, page 3, line 35-36: “pitch differential contrast” sounds
strange to me. Please consider rephrasing this.
We removed the word “differential”. Please see related reply above.
• Introduction, page 3, line 38-39: Please change “also can” by “can also.”
This has been fixed.
• Introduction, page 3, reference 32-33: Please add a reference of
primacy and recency effects in children.
A line on these effects and corresponding references has been added (lines 134-
136).
would also replace “priming effects” by “serial position effects.”
This has been fixed.
• Introduction, page 3, line 46: Please consider replacing “focusing” by
“allocating.”
This has been fixed.
• Introduction, page 3, line 61: “on the final edge” sounds strange.
This has been changed into “in utterance-final position” (line 163).
• Participants: Please provide the age range.
This is now provided in line 170.
Were all participants typically developing children?
Yes, this has now been added in lines173-174.
Why were 8- to 9-year olds recruited rather than any other age group?
We had piloted our experiment on younger kids (6- to 7-year-olds), but found
hat this task was too challenging for participants at that age, who struggled to
ocus on the task. Consequently we decided to aim at third graders, who are still
very actively acquiring new vocabulary. Following this comment, we now suggest
unning simpler or more engaging versions of our experiment also with younger
participants (lines 397-401): “ In addition, future research should aim at improving
he experimental design making the task easier for children, possibly testing also
younger participants on the same task. This may be achieved, for instance, by
mplementing the experiment into a videogame paradigm - thus making the task
more involving for children (see 62,63), by including more acoustic variation, or by
elongating the training phase.”
• Materials, line 51-52: “In order to […] to other children”: Please
consider rephrasing.
We have now rephrased this sentence as follows: “ We wanted to avoid that
children who were tested would reveal the correct word-meaning associations to
children who still had to go through the experiment.” (lines 221-222).
• Materials, page 5, line 4-5: “Each word’s intensity was adjusted to mean
69.97 dB (SD = .08) relative to peak amplitude.” I am not quite sure what
this means. Do the authors mean that the maximum intensity was 69.97 dB?
As we now clarify in lines 254-255: “Mean intensity of target and non target
monosyllabic words was 69.97 dB (SD = .08) relative to peak amplitude”.
Also, please describe how the PSOLA procedure alters the signal.
This has been added in lines 229-243:“ PSOLA is a method based on
decomposition of a signal into a series of elementary waveforms in such a way
hat each waveform represents one of the successive pitch periods of the signal
and the sum (overlap-add) of them reconstitutes the signal. The basic algorithm
or the PSOLA technique consists of three steps. First, the speech waveform is
divided into smaller, short-term analysis segments. Secondly, a mathematical
unction is applied to the signal, centering it on the successive instants tm , called
“pitchmarks”. These marks are set at a pitch-synchronous rate on the voiced parts
of the signal and at a constant rate on the unvoiced parts. Finally, these segments
are modified, by either repeating or leaving out speech segments, depending on
whether the target fundamental frequency of the signal is higher or lower than
he fundamental frequency of the source signal. The remaining segments are
ecombined into a synthesized signal through overlapping and adding. The
synthesized signal has the same spectral envelop as the source signal, but a
different fundamental frequency. To change the duration of the signal, the speech
segments may be repeated multiple times, to increase the duration - or
eliminated, to decrease the duration. The segments are then combined into a
synthesized signal using the overlap add technique.“
• Materials: The pitch level measures would fit better in the materials
section.
We have moved the description of prosodic modifications to the Sounds section
n “Material and Methods”, lines 244-255.
• Learning conditions, line 31: Please rephrase “a large magnitude cross-
inguistically typical of IDS.”
We have now changed this into “We adopted a pitch deviation of one octave, a
pitch excursion typical of IDS across multiple languages.” (lines 251-252).
• Training and test procedure, line 55-56: Please replace “in order to
familiarize with” by “in order to familiarize themselves with.”
This has been fixed.
• Training and test procedure, page 6, line 16-19: From the description, I
understand that the auditory materials at test were different from those
during training.
This is correct.
However, I do not see how each utterance being associated with a set of
three probe images yields 36 (or any other number of) trials.
To clarify this, we have now rephrased this paragraph as follows: “In the test
phase, participants were presented with a novel four-word utterance, containing
one of the three target words. Here, we used 12 novel utterances per semantic
category, for a total of 36 novel utterances. In each test trial, one utterance was
played, and 3 images were simultaneously shown on screen (again, one image per
semantic category). Each utterance was associated once with a set of three probe
mages presented simultaneously, yielding 36 test trials. ” (lines 302-307)
• Discussion: Could the authors speculate as to what would happen in the
case other (i.e. non-target) words are prosodically marked or when target
words occur sentence-initially.
These points have been addressed in lines 368-372: “ We may speculate that
urther cues aiding memory, for instance placing the target word in utterance-
nitial position - if combined with cross-situational co-occurrence of target word
and visual semantic category and with pitch marking of the target word - would
ease word learning in school-age children.”
• Discussion: To what extent do we know that utterance-final target
words can be helpful (in combination with pitch contrasts) due to serial
position reasons rather than statistical probability reasons?
As we now emphasize in lines 183-185: “The co-occurrence between target words
and their intended referent was the only consistent statistical cue that could help
participants learn the target word-referent mapping. ”. This cue is present in all
experimental conditions (lines 263-264).
Please see reply on transitional probability above: we now clarify the statistical
properties of our artificial language as follows (lines 211-220): “All non-target
words were systematically shared across utterances of the three semantic
categories, and therefore had no consistent referential link to the visual stimuli
Table 1). Within each learning condition, all non-target words were identical and
systematically occurred in the same position across semantic categories. Consider,
or instance, the utterance “loFUsheti”. The “lo” and “sheti” parts of the utterance
occurred also within the utterances “loGAsheti” and “loMIsheti”. Hence, only the
monosyllabic words shared within each semantic set of utterances constituted
arget words mappable to a specific visual semantic category. Across learning
conditions, within each semantic category, forward transitional probabilities
between monosyllabic words, i.e. the probability of one word given the
occurrence of the preceding word within each utterance, were 0, .25 or .50.”
n lines 294-296 of the discussion we now suggest future work related to this
opic: “Crucially, further work disentangling the role of statistical regularities within
he utterances and the relative contribution of other learning cues is suggested.”
• Discussion, line 55-56: I am not sure how this study shows that children
exploit pitch enhancement and sentence-final word position as cues that
mark visual categories?
We have now modified the wording using “co-occur” instead of “mark”:
“Moreover, the present study contributes additional evidence suggesting that 8-
o 9-year-old language learners exploit pitch enhancement and word utterance-
inal position as cues that co-occur with the intended target words and visual
categories across learning contexts.“ (lines 413-415)
• Discussion, line 56-60: Please rephrase this sentence. It seems to me
that these findings align with previous work underlining the importance of
utterance edges, but they do not speak to phonotactic and phonological rule
earning.
We have rephrased this part as follows: “ These findings align with previous
esearch on natural languages, underlining the importance of positional
egularities for language acquisition and processing (1).” (lines 415-417)

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper is much improved. I just have a few minor comments below.
4, 145 "only little research" --> little research
This is now fixed.
9, 389 "In fact, our results complement previous findings on word learning, showing that processing
multiple sources of information (e.g. unfamiliar, but statistically regular phonetic variations and
word-objects associations) at the same time is challenging for infants (48,62)." I don't get this at all.
First, neither of these studies cited is a word learning study. Second, yes, you could say that
earning from multiple input streams can be challenging for infants (though see Seidl et al., 2014
where it can be helpful), but then in the next sentence you say these multiple cues help children
with no supporting evidence from other work saying cues from multiple domains can be helpful).
So which one is it? Do you want to say that (a) multiple cues can be hard for babies, but is easier for
older children (but not adults) or (b) that multiple cues are hard for everyone or (c) that multiple
cues are actually helpful when they support learning structure. Point being, somehow your point is
otally lost here and I think this section just needs to be rewritten. It's complex because the data that
you cite seems to suggest that multiple cues are hard for adults and for infants, but maybe not for
kids (your study). But I also think that perhaps you are oversimplifying the data here because there
s a literature showing that multiple cues can be helpful to learning when there is e.g. redundancy
across two modalities (e.g., Bahrick and Lickliter's work).
Thank you for pointing this out. What we meant is that multiple cues are useful in supporting cross-modal
earning. We have now clarified this section, and added the suggested reference.
Figure 2: The caption says there is a * in Figure 2, but I do not see one.
This is now fixed.

Comments to the Author(s)
n general, I believe this revised manuscript has substantially improved, and most of my earlier
concerns have been addressed. One remaining issue, though, is the sample size. In their response,
he authors argue that the finding that one group is different from control means that their power is
sufficient for all of their comparisons. This does not necessarily have to be the case. It seems quite
plausible that the size of the effect may be different for each comparison (perhaps indicative of a
stepwise pattern), and that comparisons of the two intermediate conditions to the control group
equire a greater sample size to ensure a similar power level. The authors also argue that they do
not conclude that there is no difference between levels where no significant differences were
observed, but it seems to me that a conclusion such as “Hence, our data indicate that performance
n this EIM task is significantly boosted only when the two cues (words’ pitch enhancement and
utterance-position) are combined” (line 364-366) makes that inference.
Thank you for pointing this out. These conclusions have now been toned down.
Relatedly, the authors argue that the 95% confidence intervals show an overlap between the Control
and the other conditions (except the Pitch Peak + utterance final condition) and that this confirms
heir findings. First, given that the confidence interval is dependent on the sample size (with fewer
subjects displaying a consistent pattern leading to larger confidence intervals), this cannot really be
considered a confirmation. Second, an overlap in confidence intervals between conditions does not
necessarily mean that there are no differences between those conditions.
We accept this point.
Minor concerns:
Line 97: Please consider using “are subjected to” instead of “use.”
This has been fixed.
Line 110: Even lexical words (e.g. abstract nouns (love, gratitude); certain verbs (infer, hear); certain
adjectives (smart, tolerant) may not have clear referents in the visual scene.
We have now rewritten this sentence as follows: ‘Indeed, humans are naturally predisposed to acquire
words in their native language, a capacity that may involve the triple challenge of [...]”.
Line 128: “Research suggests that the general property of primacy and recency in memory abilities
may focus attention on words at the edges of an utterance in infants (37–39) and adults (36).” How
does this align with the argument made later in the paragraph that this might either be due to serial
position or to prosodic modifications? Doesn’t research simply suggest that attention is more
easily directed toward the edges of utterances?
Thank you for pointing this out. We accept that the two sentences didn’t align. We have now rephrased this
section accordingly.
Line 131-133: “Although cognitive bias to the edges of utterances might be related to prosodic
modifications such as initial strengthening and final lengthening of words at utterance boundaries”
Would a greater tendency to learn from the edges of phrases as a result of prosodic modifications
be better described as greater attention to prosodically salient items?
Yes. We have now clarified this in lines 133-136.
Line 138-141: What does it mean for statistical regularities (and eye gaze) to “orient” categorization
of visual objects or object-word associations? Do they authors mean “guide”?
Yes. We have now substituted “orient” with “guide” in the edited version.
Line 141: How does the claim that prosody guides infants’ attention in label-referent mapping
scenarios relate to the claim that statistical patterns do? Are they simply different cues that could
affect what is paid attention to?
Yes. To clarify this, we now introduce sentence in line 139 with “in addition”.
Line 173-174: Please provide the number of excluded children.
These exclusion criteria were advertised during the recruitment phase. Only children that met these criteria
applied to take part to the study.
Line 310: “They could thus make their choice from the end of the auditory stimulus playback to up
o 4 s after the sound ended.” How would this work if the image remained on screen for only 1500
ms after the end of the sound?
We apologized for the confusion. We have clarified that the images remained on screen for 1500 ms during
raining trials. In the test trials, they remained on screen 4000 ms.
Line 373-376: “suggesting that recency effects alone may not be sufficient to ease word
segmentation” It seems to me that it is currently unclear what process drives the observed effect in
his study. That is, while serial position and pitch contour might have affected segmentation, it
might also have affected word object-label mapping.
We accept this point. We have now substituted “segmentation” with the more general “learning”.

The horizontal line referred to in the caption has now been added.
