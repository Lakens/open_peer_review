This is a minor work, yet interesting and nicely written. In general, I feel some data are over
interpreted. For instance, it may have happened that Asian / pacific pigs may have been brought
by European colonizers also, and not initially by the Hawaian initial founders. It is well
documented that ships were uploading local animals as well. A short sentence on this could be
added, eg, when discussing in first paragraph of page 8. Could something be said on other feral
Pacific pigs, eg New Zealand or Australia?
Are all pigs black? (except for the spotted ones)
Could the new haplotype be produced by recombination? I would guess this is possible if only
one recombination event is required between the three synonymous and the non synonymous
mutations.
Page 6 'and are located on other east Asian MC1R alleles' --> found instead of located? haplotypes
instead of alleles?
page 8: 'Our data demonstrate' --> 'Our data show' ?
page 8, line 55: This is dubious, pigs can thrive almost everywhere and I am sure there were
fleshy fruits in Hawaii forests before the 20th century.

The authors used modern DNA (mitochondrial control region and nuclear MC1R) to elucidate
the genetic make up of the modern Hawaiian feral pig population - Polynesian or European. This
paper is an important contribution to the literature on the colonisation of the Pacific by
Polynesians, whether these genetic signitures can still be found in modern populations, and the
consequent conservation implications. I recommend this manuscript be accepted with minor
revisions, which are detailed below:
Page 2 Line 46: Please provide references for the east Asian origins of pigs (e.g. Larson et al.),
dogs (e.g. Greig et al.) and chickens (e.g. Gongora et al., Thomson et al.) in Polynesia. Please also
detail whether ancient DNA studies have been done on pigs in Hawaii, and what these studies
have found.
Page 4 Line 47: Please change to "A 700bp portion of the 5` end of the mtDNA control region was
amplified..."
Page 5 Line 3: Please only state final concentration of Betaine.
Page 5 Line 52: Please change to "published MC1R sequences obtained from published..."
Page 6 Lines 7-13: 34 + 4 + 10 = 48, not 47. In addition, you state that you tried 57 samples, yet the
Methods you sate 47 samples were attempted. Can you please clarify these numbers.
Page 7 Line 62: "This clade includes modern and ancient pig samples from across Island South
East Asia (ISEA) and the Pacific". It would be good to state whether this includes Hawaii.
Page 7-8: Patterns of geneflow amongst pigs introduced to Hawaii: How do the ancient (e.g.
Larson et al.) and modern results regarding pigs compare to Thompson et al. (2014 PNAS) work
on ancient and modern Hawaiian chickens (e.g. supposed feral Hawaiian chickens hypothesised
to descend from Polynesian stock were European - mitochondrial haplogroup E), and to
Dancause et al. (2011) work on Vanuatu chickens (predominantly Polynesian origin -
mitochondrial haplogroup D). What common patterns and contrasts are there regarding the
patterns of geneflow in Polynesian/European domesticates on the Pacific Islands.

Response to Reviewers
We thank the reviewers for their comments. We have revised the manuscript for clarity and
consistency. Below we list our responses to the specific comments of the two reviewers.
Reviewer: 1
This is a minor work, yet interesting and nicely written. In general, I feel some data are over
interpreted. For instance, it may have happened that Asian / pacific pigs may have been
brought by European colonizers also, and not initially by the Hawaian initial founders. It is
well documented that ships were uploading local animals as well. A short sentence on this
could be added, eg, when discussing in first paragraph of page 8.
Yes, we agree that ships were moving pigs from island to island, but it is clear that pigs were
originally introduced to Hawaii by Polynesians and we feel this point is made in the text as
written.
Could something be said on other feral Pacific pigs, eg New Zealand or Australia?
Perhaps, but these introductions are beyond the scope of this paper and for the sake of brevity and
clarity we have opted not to include these populations in this manuscript.
Are all pigs black? (except for the spotted ones)
No, the colouring of each sample (where known) is listed in Table S1.
Could the new haplotype be produced by recombination? I would guess this is possible if
only one recombination event is required between the three synonymous and the non
synonymous mutations.
No, the fact that the mutation occurs between two synonymous mutations associated with the
Asian sequence means the SNP is unlikely to be the result of recombination. We have amended
the text to anticipate this question.
Page 6 'and are located on other east Asian MC1R alleles' --> found instead of located?
haplotypes instead of alleles?
These are suggestions for style and we prefer our current wording.
page 8: 'Our data demonstrate' --> 'Our data show' ?
We prefer demonstrate.
page 8, line 55: This is dubious, pigs can thrive almost everywhere and I am sure there were
fleshy fruits in Hawaii forests before the 20th century.
The idea that earthworms and invasive fleshy-fruited plants enabled feral pigs to proliferate in
native habitats was put forth by some of the most experienced ecologists working in Hawaiian
ecosystems at the time. The idea is not speculation of our own, but rather it was formally
proposed in a review paper that we feel we must cite. We adjusted the last sentence of the
paragraph in minor ways, to clarify that the hypothesis comes from cited reference, and that it
does not require that there were no fleshy fruits in native Hawaiian forests beforehand.

Page 2 Line 46: Please provide references for the east Asian origins of pigs (e.g. Larson et
al.), dogs (e.g. Greig et al.) and chickens (e.g. Gongora et al., Thomson et al.) in Polynesia.
Please also detail whether ancient DNA studies have been done on pigs in Hawaii, and what
these studies have found.
We have added these in.
Page 4 Line 47: Please change to "A 700bp portion of the 5` end of the mtDNA control
region was amplified..."
We have made this change.
Page 5 Line 3: Please only state final concentration of Betaine.
We have made this change.
Page 5 Line 52: Please change to "published MC1R sequences obtained from published..."
We have made this change.
Page 6 Lines 7-13: 34 + 4 + 10 = 48, not 47. In addition, you state that you tried 57 samples,
yet the Methods you sate 47 samples were attempted. Can you please clarify these numbers.
We have checked and corrected these values throughout the manuscript.
Page 7 Line 62: "This clade includes modern and ancient pig samples from across Island
South East Asia (ISEA) and the Pacific". It would be good to state whether this includes
Hawaii.
It does, and we have amended the text to say so.
Page 7-8: Patterns of geneflow amongst pigs introduced to Hawaii: How do the ancient (e.g.
Larson et al.) and modern results regarding pigs compare to Thompson et al. (2014 PNAS)
work on ancient and modern Hawaiian chickens (e.g. supposed feral Hawaiian chickens
hypothesised to descend from Polynesian stock were European - mitochondrial haplogroup
E), and to Dancause et al. (2011) work on Vanuatu chickens (predominantly Polynesian
origin - mitochondrial haplogroup D). What common patterns and contrasts are there
regarding the patterns of geneflow in Polynesian/European domesticates on the Pacific
Islands.
The papers the reviewer is referring to relate to chickens and while this is an interesting question,
none of these publications are able to address to issue of gene flow since they only investigated
mitochondrial sequences. A more general discussion of patterns of gene flow found in domestic
animals across the Pacific would be interesting, but is beyond the scope of this manuscript.
Page 9: Can you please state where the Lanyu pig is.
We have done this.
We look forward to your consideration of this newly revised manuscript.
