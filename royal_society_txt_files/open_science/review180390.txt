Dr. Vadillo and colleagues:
I recently had the pleasure of reviewing your manuscript “Searching for the bottom of
the ego well: Failure to uncover ego depletion in Many Labs 3.” As the paper notes, I gave
comments on an earlier draft of this paper and, at that time, mainly focused on the description of
Many Labs 3 in this paper. I gave the paper a much more thorough reading this time. I’m not an
expert in the field of ego depletion, so my comments are mainly focused on the design of the
tasks in Many Labs 3 and the handling of the data.
Overall, I like how you have described and discussed the Stroop task that was used in
Many Labs 3. Although d = .91 is a rather large effect, it is small by some Stroop comparisons.
You rightly note that this could be due to the smaller number of trials. Another factor that was
pointed out to us during the review of Many Labs 3 is that the balance of congruent to
incongruent trials might have also dampened the effect. In our study, 2/3 of trials are
incongruent. When incongruent trials are rarer, they can be harder to detect for participants.
Since incongruent trials were more common in our study, it’s possible that participants were
more “on guard” for these trials and thus showed a smaller Stroop effect. I don’t believe that this
is a problem for the conclusions of this paper, but it may be worth noting alongside the relatively
brief length as a reason for a relatively small Stroop effect.
My main concern with this paper is with the selection of participants for analysis. At
present, you select participants who completed the critical tasks between slots 6 and 22. The slots
that you use to indicate task order correspond to the page numbers of the Many Labs 3
procedure. The replication studies (where both the anagrams task and Stroop task were
administered) fell between slots 2 and 26. Some studies took up multiple pages. For instance, the
Stroop task occurred over 4 pages. Therefore, as the authors point out, if participants completed
the anagram task in slot 2, 3, 4, or 5, we know that the Stroop task came after. However, since task
order was randomly assigned, all participants had just as much chance to have one of the critical
tasks before the other, even if that involved the anagram task being one of the earliest or latest
pages. I think it would help to explain the logic of these exclusions more in the paper or consider
using all participants in the analyses (e.g., not only selecting participants who completed the
anagrams between slots 6 and 22). Running the analyses without this exclusion criteria produces
the same results, but with greater precision (it adds about 1200 participants by my calculations;
you can see my reanalysis at osf.io/f62b7).
In considering the exclusion criteria, I thought of other ways to operationalize task order
in the study. For Many Labs 3, we looked at order effects by slot (from 2-26) but also by order of
study (from 1-10, the number of replications we conducted). Interestingly, when rerunning your
models using study order, instead of slot order, you do find a small effect of order of the Stroop
task with participants persisting a little longer when doing the anagram task first, p = .015, <U+03B7>p2 =
.0018 (you can see these analyses in my script as well). It’s important to note that this effect is
pretty tiny, with a relatively high p value given the sample size, and the effect is not detected in
the meta-analysis when using study order instead of slot order. I also think that slot order is a
better operationalization of task order, given that it takes into account the fact that some studies
took up more slots than others (in fact, study order is a much worse predictor of persistence
compared to slot order). Regardless, I think it would strengthen the paper to speak more about
your rationale for using slot order, as compared to something like study order, as the
operationalization of task order, given that there are multiple ways to operationalize this
variable.
As a more minor point, I like that you provide power analyses for various possible
3
values of depletion effects using both the Stroop and unsolvable anagrams paradigms. Certainly,
the current sample size should give you the power to detect the effects reported in the previous
meta-analyses. However, as you also point out, it looks like studies using the anagrams task
might have some evidence of selective reporting and publication bias. This makes the power
analyses you ran potentially optimistic (even considering the fact that you used the lower bounds
of the confidence intervals for those effects). Given that you make both of these claims, I think it
would help to link the two in your discussion; that if this literature is suffering from publication
and reporting biases, it is possible that there are true effects that are just much smaller than we’ve
estimated, making even samples in the thousands underpowered to detect them. I think this
would say much more about those effects than your current investigation, but this seems a
plausible interpretation of what you found given your assessment of this field.
Finally, I just wanted to say thank you for making your analysis scripts available. They
were very easy to follow and helped immensely with my review.

label_comment_2
This is an interesting study looking at ED in a large sample. The method for exploring it is (as the
authors acknowledge) not ideal due to the lack of control in timing of tasks etc. The authors are
however open with these issues and attempt to control for them in the analyses. They are indeed
very open with the limitations and despite these issues I think this paper makes a contribution to
the literature. I have some broad comments on the study as written
Page three author state - Seemingly minor feature “of investing more effort into a task”. Within
the framework of the model is not a minor feature, rather a critical feature. If increased effort is
put into a task surely this would be more depleting (according to the model). A participant that
puts no effort into the task would not show a depleting effect. I think this comment conflates task
4
related-issues (whether a dominant response was developed or not) and whether effort mediates
the effect of the manipulation. Take an individual who did not have the dominant response
trained but still found the task very hard and worked their hardest to complete the task (by no
means and impossibility)- according to the model they would show effects of the manipulation
(whether by the proposed mechanism or simply because they cannot be bothered trying
anymore).
Re statistics: Was the data used in the regressions normally distributed it seems from the
description of the tasks (with a timeout) it could be skewed or bimodal), it would be good to see a
statement from the authors about this is inappropriate regression analyses are commonplace.
Was collinearity an issue with the data at all? (VIFs>3)
-Another limitation with the study and indeed much of the ego deletion research is the
assumption that the participants are, in some way, motivated to try hard on the task used as the
DV. Unless there is a good reason for them doing so e.g. monetary reward, sticking with a diet etc
I cannot see a reason why there would be a motivation to try. In the context of this study after a
large battery of tests this could be a problem, lack of effort in a no-consequence task is a plausible
reason for null findings. I think this represents a limitation of the current study and indeed a
plausible explanation for null in many studies findings.

Comments to the Author:
Thank you for submitting this work to RSOS. I've now received reviews from two expert referees,
and have read the manuscript myself both prior to and after receiving their comments. There is
broad enthusiasm for this work, as it addresses a timely and important question, namely, the
replicability of so-called ego-depletion effects on measures of self-control. The primary concern
voiced among the reviewers relates to the suitability of the methods employed here for providing
a strong test of ego-depletion. While these issue do limit the impact of the work somewhat, you
are quite candid about these limitations and, for the most part, appropriately consider how the
might affect the strength of inferences drawn from these data. On the whole, I am comfortable
proceeding after the remaining, relatively minor, concerns raised in review are addressed. Please
respond to both reviewers' points in detail, with additional data, analyses or textual revisions as
appropriate.

review of Many Labs 3 is that the balance of congruent to

analysis when using study order instead of slot order. I also
think that slot order is a better operationalization of task order,
given that it takes into account the fact that some studies took
up more slots than others (in fact, study order is a much worse
predictor of persistence compared to slot order). Regardless, I
think it would strengthen the paper to speak more about your
rationale for using slot order, as compared to something like
study order, as the operationalization of task order, given that
there are multiple ways to operationalize this variable.
As a more minor point, I like that you provide power analyses True, our power calculations may be too optimistic if the effect

current sample size should give you the power to detect the
effects reported in the previous meta-analyses. However, as
you also point out, it looks like studies using the anagrams task
might have some evidence of selective reporting and
publication bias. This makes the power analyses you ran
potentially optimistic (even considering the fact that you used
the lower bounds of the confidence intervals for those effects).
Given that you make both of these claims, I think it would help
to link the two in your discussion; that if this literature is
suffering from publication and reporting biases, it is possible
that there are true effects that are just much smaller than we’ve
estimated, making even samples in the thousands
underpowered to detect them. I think this would say much more
about those effects than your current investigation, but this
seems a plausible interpretation of what you found given your
assessment of this field.

put into a task surely this would be more depleting (according to
the model). A participant that puts no effort into the task would
not show a depleting effect. I think this comment conflates task

not) and whether effort mediates the effect of the manipulation.
Take an individual who did not have the dominant response
