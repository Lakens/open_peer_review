plasticity rules that act on top of this model and observe there are no stable fixed points which is
consistent with standard notion of run away Hebbian plasticity. However, interestingly, they
find the overall effect of these plasticity rule , whether net LTD or LTD depends on the region
parameter space. Thus they show that synaptic efficacies can be stabilized by cycling between

label_comment_2
This paper uses a neural field model to consider changes in plasticity and the sleep wake cycle.
This builds on previous work, and in fact at least half of the paper and 3 of the 6 figures appear to
be a review of existing work of the second author. The key contributions of this paper are then
lost in the detail at the end and it is not at all clear to me how robust the results are - or really
support their conclusion that sleep and wake are necessary. For example, they argue that the
parameters need to take values such that regions of opposite flow occur, and then give a table of
values that give such a condition - but how constrained is this? Are there many such parameter
sets? Would different values change their conclusions? I wasn't clear where from the dynamics
one can see that the AAS pushes the system between wake and sleep.
I also note that the figures could be improved (and numbered!).

The authors state that they have reduced the theory section "by about 10% and combined Figs 2&
3". Since changes are not indicated on the manuscript, it was hard to see that many alterations
have been made to the text. I could see that 1 sentence (2 and a half lines had been deleted), but
could not identify any other changes.
The authors state that fixed points do not exist. They do not show this but instead state that "it is
very unlikely". This statement of likelihood then seems to be transmuted into a much stronger
8
statement on the existence of fixed points. In addition, it is stated that there are no limit cycles,
but I cannot see any real support for this statement.
The authors argue that the sign of plasticity are opposite in wake and sleep - but this seems to
hold only for eyes closed and not for eyes open.

Response to Reviewer 1:
We thank the reviewer for their feedback and comments. Our responses to the points raised
by the reviewer are interleaved and placed in the indented sections in the text below.
Reviewer comment: 1.1:
In this study the authors present analysis of the effect of plasticity in neural field (NF) model
of a corticothalamic system. The parameters of the NF model model are chosen to
qualitatively reflect EEG recording from major brain states. They then study the stability of
simplified synaptic plasticity rules that act on top of this model and observe there are no
stable fixed points which is consistent with standard notion of run away Hebbian plasticity.
However, interestingly, they find the overall effect of these plasticity rule , whether net
LTD or LTD depends on the region parameter space. Thus they show that synaptic
efficacies can be stabilized by cycling between subregions. And further that an appropriate
set of subregions that could be involved are consistent with the sleep and wake cycle. This is
very interesting paper which is carefully discussed and analysed and is also well written and
enjoyable to read. I have no substantive criticisms of this work and would like to see it
published ASAP. Below I list some minor correction and comments that could improve the
manuscript further
Linearisation of the population-average response function, eq 3, allows the author to
express several function analytically which definitely provides nice insight into the
dynamics. However, it would have been nice to see simulations of how sensitive the
dynamics are to the relaxations of this approximation. Furthermore in the presence of strong
plasticity is it likely that this assumption will breakdown anway?. It would nice to see some
discussion of this and more generally complications that could rise by introduction of
significant nonlinear interactions.
Author’s Response 1.1:
Fast dynamics are not sensitive to long term nonlinear effects and there is a strong
match between the linear approximation and the full nonlinear model (seen by the
match between the power spectra of the models). Because plastic changes happen
on a much slower timescale than the dynamics (weak plasticity) we can thus use
instantaneous linearizations of the system to track and estimate the long-term
evolution of average synaptic strengths. As mentioned in section 3.1 of the
manuscript, the rate of change of synaptic strengths depends on the spectral features
of the system at any given moment. To add further clarification, we have added a
description of our methodology in section 3.4. In summary, the rate of change of
synaptic strengths is used to calculate the new strengths at the next time step, where
the system is linearized again to obtain the new gains. The plasticity at the next time
step is then a function of the new gains.
Reviewer comment: 1.2:
While the phenomenology is appealing could the authors comment on functionality of the
plasticity, would the system lead to something like associate learning and appropriate
normalisation of the synapses during sleep?
Author’s Response 1.1:
The study of memory and learning requires analysis at the synaptic level, which is a
much finer scale than our equations are intended to model. While we cannot
conclude that individual synapses are normalized during sleep, our results show that
average strengths do return to within approximately 10% of their original values
after sleep, as mentioned in section 3.4 of the manuscript. While our conclusion is
consistent with the hypothesis of sleep-induced memory reinforcement via synaptic
normalization, we do not directly simulate that in this paper.
Reviewer comment: 1.3:
A major distinction between eyes closed and and open is the presence of sensory input, and
some authors suggest that these difference could be accounted for by action of input,
perhaps as the result of a displaced nonlinear system [1], rather than than it reflecting a
direct change parameters by a modulatory influence. Indeed shifts between EO and ES are
fast so shift in parameter regime seem unlikely. Could the authors comment on this.

Corrado, G. S., ... & Bradley, D. C. (2010). Stimulus onset quenches neural variability: a
widespread cortical phenomenon. Nature neuroscience, 13(3), 369.
Author’s Response 1.3:
We do indeed observe a change of input strength between EC and EO. The external
input (stimulus) gain is captured by the <U+0001D43A><U+0001D460><U+0001D45B> parameter and varies between states. All
the gains in the system, including <U+0001D43A><U+0001D460><U+0001D45B> have been previously estimated by fits to
experimental spectra, without any prior assumptions about their expected values
(only ranges); nonetheless, they reflect physiologically meaningful values and are
able to reproduce the observed dynamics in each state. In Table 2 of the manuscript
we have listed the gains of the representative arousal states and in the case of <U+0001D43A><U+0001D460><U+0001D45B> , it
can be seen that the value is larger in EO (=14.2) than in EC (=8.1), as expected.
Concerning the fast parameter changes, they are due to modulatory influences, rather
than changes in external stimuli. Our reasoning is as follows: (i) the inputs to the
system only account for a small fraction of the total neural activity, since most of the
activity stems from neural feedbacks within the system [2]. Thus external inputs
themselves are not sufficient to significantly perturb the state of the system. (ii) In
the work of Churchland et al. a stimulus onset was shown to shift neuronal firing
states, but only momentarily and only for the duration of the stimulus. This
mechanism would shift the system for a short time, but not during a whole sleep or
wake episode. (iii) The parameter changes between wake and sleep are reported to
be due to the indirect modulatory influences on the AAS. It has previously been
established that neurons that cause sleep are located in the ventrolateral pre-optic
area of the hypothalamus (VLPO) and that they inhibit the arousal system by
releasing GABA and Galanin neurotransmitters. When the arousal system is active,
the VLPO neurons become silent and the subject is awake [32].
We have modified the manuscript section 3.4 to clarify the neuromodulatory
influence of the AAS in the observed parameter shifts.

Reviewer comment: 1.3:
1.4) Minor correction: For completeness please define \bf{r} in equation 1. Obviously this is
completely germaine for NF people but would be nice for completeness.
Author’s Response 1.3: Done.
Response to Reviewer 2:
We thank the reviewer for their feedback and comments. Our responses to the points raised
by the reviewer are interleaved and placed in the indented sections in the text below.
Reviewer comment: 2.1:
This paper uses a neural field model to consider changes in plasticity and the sleep wake
cycle. This builds on previous work, and in fact at least half of the paper and 3 of the 6
figures appear to be a review of existing work of the second author.
Author’s Response 2.1:
Our methodology is based on a number of applications of NFT, including plasticity,
and the parametrization of the arousal state space, both of which are necessary for
understanding the results of the paper. We have therefore provided a self-contained
but brief outline of previous work to make the article accessible to a broad
multidisciplinary audience. However, we have further reduced the Theory section of
the manuscript by about 10% and combined Figs 2 and 3.
Reviewer comment: 2.1:
The key contributions of this paper are then lost in the detail at the end and it is not at all
clear to me how robust the results are - or really support their conclusion that sleep and
wake are necessary. For example, they argue that the parameters need to take values such
that regions of opposite flow occur, and then give a table of values that give such a
condition - but how constrained is this? Are there many such parameter sets? Would
different values change their conclusions?
Author’s Response 2.1:
As stated in section 3, our findings are that: (i) Once plasticity dynamics are turned
on, there are no fixed points in the system, for any parameter combinations. (ii) Thus
a parametric stabilization scenario is necessary, regardless of the parameters, where
flows are opposite. (iii) As we have elaborated in section 3.3, the existence of
opposite flow regions requires the plasticity parameters similar to the ones listed in
Table 3. The set of plasticity parameters provided in Table 3 are estimates that yield
the opposite flow regions and they are robust to small perturbations. Small changes
in their values shift the nullclines of the system, thereby growing or shrinking the
opposite sign flow regions in Fig.5. The plasticity windows themselves are
physiologically constrained, and within experimentally found ranges [10]. As
mentioned in the same table caption, A+ is positive and A- is negative, i.e. LTP and
LTP occur for +t and –t, respectively. (iv) Without imposing any constraints on the
location of the opposite flow zones, they are found to exist within parameter
subregions that are associated with wake and sleep.
We have clarified the constraint and robustness of the plasticity parameters in
section 3.3 of the manuscript.
Reviewer comment: 2.1:
I wasn't clear where from the dynamics one can see that the AAS pushes the system between
wake and sleep.
Author’s Response 2.1:
We do not include the equations of the dynamics of the AAS in our model. As
mentioned in the manuscript, the action of the AAS in pushing the system between
wake and sleep parameter regions is based on finding from previous works which
estimated the locations of sleep and wake in XYZ space. It has been established that
neurons that cause sleep are located in the ventrolateral pre-optic area of the
hypothalamus (VLPO) and that they inhibit the arousal system by releasing GABA
and Galanin neurotransmitters. When the arousal system is active, the VLPO
neurons become silent and the subject is awake [32].
We have modified the manuscript section 3.4 to clarify the neuromodulatory
influence of the AAS in the observed parameter shifts. The action of the AAS
provides the necessary step in cycling the system between opposite-flow plasticity
regions that are found to exist within wake and sleep.
Reviewer comment: 2.1:
I also note that the figures could be improved (and numbered!).
Author’s Response 2.1:
Due to the submission guidelines of the journal, the figures were separated from
their captions. Figures have now been placed with their captions in the text.

Response to Reviewer
We thank the reviewer for their feedback and help in improving the manuscript. Our responses to
points raised by the reviewer are interleaved in the text below, along with the reviewer’s comments.
Reviewer comment: The authors state that they have reduced the theory section "by about 10% and
combined Figs 2& 3". Since changes are not indicated on the manuscript, it was hard to see that
many alterations have been made to the text. I could see that 1 sentence (2 and a half lines had been
deleted), but could not identify any other changes.
Author response: The theory section is self-contained, and we have reduced it as much as
possible. Combining Figs 2 & 3 reduced the length of the section along with cuts in the
corresponding text from about 11.5 pages to 10 pages. Further reductions in the theory text
in the current submission are listed below.
Old Manuscript changes: pp. 5, lines 18-19, 46-47. pp. 6, line 12, lines 18-20, 31-32.
Referee comment: The authors state that fixed points do not exist. They do not show this but
instead state that "it is very unlikely". This statement of likelihood then seems to be transmuted into
a much stronger statement on the existence of fixed points. In addition, it is stated that there are no
limit cycles, but I cannot see any real support for this statement.
Author response: In our plasticity parameter exploration, we varied the ratio of LTP and
LTD in each plasticity window, with 0.1 increments, and found no combinations that
produced a fixed point. Also, as stressed in the manuscript (lines 3-8 on page 17), even if the
nullclines intersect at a single point by tightly fixing the parameters, this fixed point will not
be robust to small parameter changes. The statement about the non-existence of limit cycles
follows from the fact that a fixed point must exist inside a limit cycle [1].
[1] Steven H. Strogatz, "Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos", Westview Pr, 2000.
Changes in manuscript: We have thus removed the strong aforementioned statement, and
state instead that we found no fixed points for different combinations of the plasticity
parameters (pp. 16-17).
Referee comment: The authors argue that the sign of plasticity are opposite in wake and sleep - but
this seems to hold only for eyes closed and not for eyes open.
Author response: Note that the eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) states are parameter
zones, rather than single points, as illustrated in Fig. 2C and Fig. 2D, and these two zones
largely overlap. The parameter regions where the sign of plasticity are opposite in wake and
sleep are marked in Fig. 4, and the region in wake resides inside a subset of EC and EO
zones, and this could constrain the EC and EO zones to narrower regions of the parameter
space.
The example EO state was used in Fig. 3, because it is a common example of EO parameters
in older studies. This particular point does not fall within the region constrained by sleep-
wake plasticity; however, later analysis (Fig. 4) shows that parts of the EO zone do fall
within the plasticity constrained region.
We have added a statement in the manuscript to clarify this point (pp 16, lines 25-26).
