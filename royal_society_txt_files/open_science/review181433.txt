Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
Schroeter et al. build in the current manuscript on their earlier works in an effort to mitigate a
potentially major issue in palaeoproteomics - the presence of large amounts of humics in fossil
bone interfering during protein extraction and MS analysis. This is a relevant question to resolve,
as is indicated by the recent literature on this topic as well.
The major issue with the manuscript is that an internal control is lacking. That is, claims of
relevance made in the paper of enhanced protein extraction through either Method 1 and Method
2 refer to extractions and data presented in a previous paper (Cleland et al., 2016, PRSB; Cleland
et al., 2012, Plos One). However, recent research in protein preservation has shown remarkable
variation of within-bone protein preservation, necessitating that extraction comparisons are
performed on homogenized bone powders. Further issues with comparing the enhanced results
derive from an absence in protein or peptide quantification, differences in MS set-up, and column
chemistry. Therefore, the main conclusion of the paper could be seen as suggestive.
Minor comments:
-Lines 54-65. This is one massive sentence. Please break up in smaller sentences.
-Lines 85-98. The four elements of the used extraction methods are presented as novel. However,
each of these has already appeared in the palaeoproteomic literature at least once. To avoid the
suggestion that all four elements are introduced here for the first time, references to relevant
literature are justified.
-Line 96: The re-occurring claim that this bone specimen has a particularly high humic content
requires quantification.
-Line 126 vs line 147: You mention "a small piece", but later refer to approx. 250 mg., which is a
large piece of bone, especially of this age. These two statements are in conflict, especially as
"small" frequently refers to samples under 20mg in the isotope, collagen, and bone proteome
literature.
-Line 257: I think you mean smaller than 3 kDa, not larger than 3 kDa.

I have reviewed the revisions made by the authors in order to address the first round of reviews.
The authors have responded in an adequate way to all queries.
I do not wish to add any more comments as it would not be fair on the authors, but I would
strongly suggest to change the title as follows "A proteomic method to extract, concentrate, digest
and enrich peptides from from sub-fossil bones with colored (humic) substances for mass
spectrometry analyses". This is because: a) the paper only deals with bone, which has different
characteristics than other substrates for paleoproteomics (for example skipping demineralization
is not appropriate in all cases); b) "fossil" is a difficult word and often implies no organics and old
age - using "sub-fossil" is useful to indicate that you do have organics; c) "abundant" still implies
quantitation, which is not available in the paper; d) technically the authors do not provide
chemical evidence that the colored substances are in fact "humics" - better to focus on the color
aspect.

Editorial office comments:
Unfortunately, in an earlier round of review, the comments supplied by a reviewer that were
intended for the author as well as the Editor were not communicated to the authors, as the
comments had been included in the comments to the Editor. Following our standard processes,
these comments were not forwarded to the authors (comments supplied in confidence to the
Editor are not generally communicated to the authors); however, from the comments of the
reviewer, it would seem these comments were intended for the author as well. With this in mind,
we now supply the substantive elements of these comments immediately below, with the current
round of comments provided below this. We apologise for this state of affairs, and hope you'll
address the comments in this round of review.
==Original comments==
there are inconsistencies between different statements in the materials and methods section. For
example, on page 6 it is stated that the bone sample was divided into 10 aliquots of which 5 were
treated with NaOH and then all 10 samples were treated with the 400/200/4 solution. But on the
following page (p7) it is stated that there were three sample sets, one of which had NaOH but no
400/200/4 treatment, which is inconsistent with the description given on the preceding page.
Figure 1 is of little help in undestanding the experimental protocol. Overall, this article if revised
could make a useful contribution to the palaeoproteomics literature but as submitted I think that
it fails to meet the journal's requirement that published work should be "scientifically sound, in
which the methodology is rigorous and the conclusions fully supported by the data".

In the manuscript entitled "A proteomic method to extract, concentrate, digest, and enrich
peptides from fossils with colored (humic) substances for mass spectrometry analyses", Schroeter
11
and co-authors describe an protocol to extract ancient protein residues from bone samples highly
infiltrated with coloured (humic) substances. As the authors point out, the challenge the method
aims at addressing is significant. The study clearly describes how the method presented clearly
leads to higher recoveries in terms of proteins peptides and PSMs. In the current version the
manuscript is clearly readable, the experimental protocol is described with enough detail to
guarantee its reproducibility and the literature review is pertinent and exhaustive. The evidence
presented is solid and reliable and it fully supports the conclusions reported. I have no major
comments, just a very few minor suggestions to marginally improve clarity. Specifically:
Line 121: "Two extraction methods were tested; one that..." could be replaced with: "Two
extraction methods were tested: one that..."
It could be useful to specify the pH of some of the buffers and solutions used for sample
preparation, e.g. ABC.
Line 194: "... an adapted, centrifugal..." could be replaced with: "... an adapted centrifugal...".
Line 317: The title "Efficiency and Modifications" is in my opinion a bit vague and does not
effectively describe the content of the following paragraph. I suggest to replace it with something
a bit more specific, such as: "Efficiency and Possible Variations of the Experimental Workflow".
Globally, I think the authors did a very good job.

Appendix A
We thank both reviewers for their comments and suggestions. Below, we have detailed the edits
we’ve made to the manuscript in response to their suggestions. Additionally, we have uploaded a
“tracked changes” version of the current manuscript that shows all of these changes in the
document (as well a few minor typos we have corrected).
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Schroeter et al. build in the current manuscript on their earlier works in an effort to mitigate a
potentially major issue in palaeoproteomics - the presence of large amounts of humics in fossil
bone interfering during protein extraction and MS analysis. This is a relevant question to resolve,
as is indicated by the recent literature on this topic as well.
The major issue with the manuscript is that an internal control is lacking. That is, claims of
relevance made in the paper of enhanced protein extraction through either Method 1 and Method
2 refer to extractions and data presented in a previous paper (Cleland et al., 2016, PRSB; Cleland
et al., 2012, Plos One). However, recent research in protein preservation has shown remarkable
variation of within-bone protein preservation, necessitating that extraction comparisons are
performed on homogenized bone powders. Further issues with comparing the enhanced results
derive from an absence in protein or peptide quantification, differences in MS set-up, and
column chemistry. Therefore, the main conclusion of the paper could be seen as suggestive.
We thank reviewer 1 for their comments. We agree that a direct comparison is needed to
quantify the relative contributions the many differences between the old study and the new study
each had to the increase in protein identification, and to account for intra-bone variation.
However, the main contribution of this paper is that this combined method allows protein
extracts dark with humics to be concentrated and clarified without losing low-abundance proteins
(e.g., NCPs). Thus, to address the reviewer’s concerns we have softened the language to shift
focus from relative “improvement” over an older method, to the fact that this combined
workflow allows sensitive analyses of low-abundance proteins in fossils containing abundant
humics (as supported by its retrieval of 12 non-collagenous proteins). Additionally, we have
added a statement acknowledging the limits of the comparison that can be made between the two
methods.
Modifications to the text include:
Abstract—We have changed “This method allows better and more sensitive analyses of low-
abundance proteins in fossils containing humics” to “This workflow allows analyses of low-
abundance proteins in fossils containing humics.”
Results—We have added the following sentence to the paragraph comparing the 2015 study with
the current study:
“A direct comparison of the HCl-ABC method employed in Cleland 20151 and this
combined method is needed to quantify the relative contributions to the observed increase
in efficiency from the various differences in their workflows (e.g., extraction buffers, MS
instrument, column packing) and to fully account for possible intra-bone variation in
protein preservation in this specimen.2-3 Regardless, this combined workflow obtained 15
additional proteins previously unreported for this specimen, supporting its overall
improvement in recovery.”
Conclusion—We have changed “Because this method allows better and more sensitive MS
analyses of low-abundance proteins in fossils with a high humic content” to “Because this
workflow allows MS analyses of low-abundance proteins in fossils with abundant humic
content”
Minor comments:
-Lines 54-65. This is one massive sentence. Please break up in smaller sentences.
We have separated this list into individual sentences. That section now reads as follows:
“For example, these substances interfere with colormetric assays used for protein
quantitation (e.g., Bradford and bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assays),8 preventing accurate
measurement of protein for subsequent analyses. They also bind silver-stain, generating
false-positives in SDS-PAGE gels, or can pre-stain gel lanes and obscure chemical stains
applied to separated proteins.9-10 They can contaminate the isotopic content of ancient bone
and interfere with stable isotope analyses.2, 11 In mass spectrometry experiments, humic
substances can cause ion-suppression during electrospray ionization (ESI),3, 12 leading to
either depressed signal intensity or no signal (regardless of the presence of protein in the
sample). Further, they can clog analytical columns or spray tips during liquid
chromatography,3 causing unstable spray and/or the loss of samples, columns, or spray tips.
Even when these substances do not clog analytical columns, they can generate a build-up of
particulate matter on the ion optics, which can suppress or prevent signal during analyses of
all subsequent samples, necessitating expensive and time-consuming instrument cleaning.”
-Lines 85-98. The four elements of the used extraction methods are presented as novel. However,
each of these has already appeared in the palaeoproteomic literature at least once. To avoid the
suggestion that all four elements are introduced here for the first time, references to relevant
literature are justified.
To clarify that this is a method combined from elements previously utilized in paleoproteomics
and adapted for humic removal, we have added the following sentence to the introduction:
“Although the individual components of this method have been variously applied in
previous paleoproteomic studies (e.g., non-demineralizing buffer,4-5 FASP6-7) their
combination and adaptation for humic removal has not yet been explored.”
Addtionally, because during the course of this review a new paper was published discussing the
removal of humics from fossil bones for proteomics, we have added the following sentence to
the paragraph of the introduction that talks about previous methods to remove humics from
protein extracts:
“Cleland et al.5 employed a method utilizing both a non-demineralizing buffer and
magnetic beads to separate humics from proteins in unconcentrated protein extracts.”
-Line 96: The re-occurring claim that this bone specimen has a particularly high humic content
requires quantification.
A quantitative comparison of the humic content of this moa fossil versus typical fossil specimens
is beyond the scope of this paper. Thus, we have modified sentences in the abstract, introduction,
and conclusion to avoid suggesting the humic content of this fossil is exceptionally high rather
than simply abundant.
Modifications to the text include:
• Title—We have changed “fossils with high humic content” to “fossils with abundant
humics”
• Abstract—We have changed the phrase “a moa fossil with very high humic content” to “a
moa fossil dark with humic content”
• Abstract—We have changed the phrase “in fossils with high humic content” to “fossils
with humic content”
• Introduction—We have changed the phrase “a moa fossil with high humic content” to “a
moa fossil with humic content”
• Conclusion—We have changed the phrase “protein extracts from a moa fossil with a very
high humic content” to “protein extracts from a moa fossil inferred from their dark color
to have a high humic content”
• Conclusion—We have changed “fossils with high humic content” to “fossils with
abundant humic content.”
-Line 126 vs line 147: You mention "a small piece", but later refer to approx. 250 mg., which is a
large piece of bone, especially of this age. These two statements are in conflict, especially as
"small" frequently refers to samples under 20mg in the isotope, collagen, and bone proteome
literature.
We have removed “small” from line 126, and now simply refer to “a piece of dark cortical
bone.”
-Line 257: I think you mean smaller than 3 kDa, not larger than 3 kDa.
We did indeed mean “less than.” We have corrected this typo.

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
It is suggested that the methods section of the article should be revised to improve its clarity.
We thank reviewer 2 for this recommendation. Because the reviewer did not provide specific
instructions or recommendations, to improve clarity, we constructed a supplemental table
(Supplemental Table 1) that breaks down each phase of the extraction and sample preparation
procedures into a series of steps. The location of each action (e.g., in tube, in filter), the reagent
used and the volume of it added, the incubation time and temperature, the centrifugation time
and speed, and the number of times an action is performed/repeated, are listed in a concise
format, to complement the more detailed description provided in the text.
To direct readers to this table, we have added the sentence, “Supplementary Table 1 provides a
concise breakdown of the steps comprising the extraction, FASP, and stage tipping procedures,”
to the end of the first paragraph in the Protein Extraction Section of the Methods.
Additionally, the previous Supplementary Table 1 has now been changed to Supplementary
Table 2.

26 ABSTRACT
27
28 Humic substances are break-down products of decaying organic matter that co-extract with
29 proteins from fossils. These substances are difficult to separate from proteins in solution, and
30 interfere with analyses of fossil proteomes. We introduce a method combining multiple recent
31 advances in extraction protocols to both concentrate proteins from fossil specimens with high
32 humic content, and remove humics, producing clean samples easily analyzed by mass
33 spectrometry (MS). This method includes: 1) a non-demineralizing extraction buffer that
34 eliminates protein loss during the demineralization step in routine methods; 2) filter-aided
35 sample preparation (FASP) of peptides, which concentrates and digests extracts in one filter,
36 allowing the separation of large humics after digestion; 3) centrifugal stage-tipping, which
37 further clarifies and concentrates samples in a uniform process performed simultaneously on
38 multiple samples. We apply this method to a moa fossil (~800–1000 yr) dark with humic

48 BACKGROUND
54
55 Humic substances are break-down products of decaying organic matter1 that, to the frustration of
56 many protein researchers, co-extract with proteins from fossils (e.g.,2) and soil (e.g.,3). These
57 complex, hydrophilic, dark-colored substances have a large molecular weight range (< 10 kDa to
58 > 100 kDa), and are notoriously difficult to separate from proteins in solution.1, 4-7 This causes a
59 host of problems for a number of down-stream chemical analyses when conducting
E. Schroeter 12/12/2018 11:34 AM
60 paleoproteomics of fossil tissues. For example, these substances interfere with colormetric assays104 Deleted: trying to …onducting ... [1]
61 used for protein quantitation (e.g., Bradford and bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assays),8 preventing
62 accurate measurement of protein for subsequent analyses. They also bind silver-stain, generating
63 false-positives in SDS-PAGE gels, or can pre-stain gel lanes and obscure chemical stains applied
64 to separated proteins.9-10 They can contaminate the isotopic content of ancient bone and interfere
65 with stable isotope analyses.2, 11 In mass spectrometry experiments, humic substances can cause
66 ion-suppression during electrospray ionization (ESI),3, 12 leading to either depressed signal
67 intensity or no signal (regardless of the presence of protein in the sample). Further, they can clog
68 analytical columns or spray tips during liquid chromatography,3 causing unstable spray and/or
69 the loss of samples, columns, or spray tips. Even when these substances do not clog analytical
70 columns, they can generate a build-up of particulate matter on the ion optics, which can suppress
71 or prevent signal during analyses of all subsequent samples, necessitating expensive and time-
72 consuming instrument cleaning.
73
74 Although the analytical problems generated by humic substances can be quite severe, fossilized
75 bone containing high amounts of humic substances may potentially be valuable sources of
76 paleoproteomic information. Humic acids can play a role in diagentically cross-linking collagen
105 molecules in a manner similar to leather tanning or fixation with formaldehyde.1 This suggests
106 that fossils with humic content may be more likely to preserve original, minimally altered
107 collagen molecules incorporated into diagenetic complexes with exogenous humics.1 However,
108 any such preserved proteins are not readily accessible by MS, requiring them to be both extracted
109 and separated from interfering humic substances.
110
111 A number of approaches have been employed to remove humic substances from bone2, 13 and
E. Schroeter 11/30/2018 3:04 PM
112 soil3 samples. For example, Szpak et al.2 tested the efficiency of both sodium hydroxide (NaOH) 128 Deleted: pH adjustment and ultrafiltration
113 and ultrafiltration to remove humics from archaeological bone for isotopic analyses, and found
114 that post-demineralization with HCl, sequential incubations with NaOH could be used to remove
115 the alkali-soluble fraction of humic substances from samples. Qian et al.3 developed a method
116 that, subsequent to enzymatic digestion of soil protein extracts, used ultrafilters to remove
117 humics that had been precipitated from an acidified (~pH 3) peptide digest. Cleland et al.13
118 employed a method utilizing both a non-demineralizing buffer and magnetic beads to separate
119 humics from proteins in unconcentrated protein extracts.
120
121 Here, we introduce a method that builds on these findings and several recent advances in protein
122 extraction protocols to optimize the recovery of ancient proteins for paleoproteomics from fossils
123 that contain a high amount of humic substances. This method: 1) utilizes a non-demineralization
124 extraction buffer,14 because the demineralization phase of traditional bone protein extractions has
125 been shown to be a source of loss,15 particularly for non-collagenous proteins; 2) allows for the
126 concentration of a relatively large amount of extraction supernatant into a small sample volume,
127 which is crucial for fossil specimens with a low abundance of preserved protein, but challenging
129 for those that also contain humic substances, which co-elute with protein; 3) uses a modified
130 filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) protocol16 to filter humic substances from
131 proteins/peptides both before and after digestion; 4) removes remaining humic substances with
132 centrifugal stage-tip protocol17 that can prepare multiple samples simultaneously and
133 consistently. Although the individual components of this method have been variously applied in
134 previous paleoproteomic studies (e.g., non-demineralizing buffer,13, 18 FASP19-20) their
135 combination and adaptation for humic removal has not yet been explored. We apply this
136 combined method to a moa fossil21 with humic content, from which preserved proteins were

140 MATERIALS & METHODS
141
142 Specimen
143
144 We analyzed fossilized (800–1000 yr) moa cortical bone (MOR OFT255, courtesy J. Horner and
145 Museum of the Rockies) recovered from New Zealand cave deposits.21 This specimen was used
146 because: 1) despite its relatively young age, the dark coloration of both the whole cortical
147 fragments (described as very dark brown to nearly black)23 and the extraction supernatants
148 produced in previous studies22-23 suggests a high content of humic substances; 2) Previous
149 studies of this specimen using different extraction methods23 and MS analyses22 successfully
150 produced evidence of protein preservation, including collagen I alpha 1 and alpha 2 sequences
151 with biological and diagenetic post-translational modifications (PTMs). Thus, MOR OFT255
153 represents an ideal test case, in which both bone proteins and humic substances are known to be
154 present in the tissue, allowing us monitor the effect of humic removal on peptide recovery.
155
156 Protein Extraction
157
158 Two extraction methods were tested; one that used a single incubation in a non-demineralization
159 reagent14 for protein solubilization, and one that incorporated a brief pre-treatment of the bone
160 powder with NaOH, followed by an extraction identical to the first in all other respects. NaOH
161 has been used to remove “pigments” from bone prior to collagen extraction24, humic acids from
162 archaeological bone2, or to improve the efficiency of some bone protein extraction methods.15
163 Therefore, we tested this extraction method both with and without an NaOH pre-treatment step
164 to assess its usefulness in both removing humics and extracting peptides. Figure 1 illustrates the
165 basic workflow of the developed extraction procedure (NaOH pretreatment step not shown).
166 Supplementary Table 1 provides a concise breakdown of the steps comprising the extraction,
167 FASP, and stage tipping procedures.
168
169 A piece of dark cortical bone was ground to a fine powder in a sterilized mortar and pestle. Bone
E. Schroeter 11/28/2018 11:57 AM
170 powder (50-55 mg/tube) was aliquoted into 10, 1.5 ml Protein LoBind centrifugation tubes 175 Deleted: small
171 (Eppendorf). An equal number of empty tubes, containing no bone powder but treated identically
172 to bone samples in every way, were also prepared (i.e., “blank” control samples). Five tubes of
173 each set received 1 ml of 0.1 M NaOH, were vortexed to mix, then were incubated at 4°C for 4 h
174 with rocking. The remaining five aliquots and blanks were stored dry at 4°C for the same length
176 of time. Samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 rcf for 15 min, and NaOH fractions were
177 collected and frozen at -80°C to await concentration.
178
179 All 10 aliquots of bone powder then received 600 µL of a solution containing 400 mM
180 ammonium phosphate diabasic (APD), 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC), and 4 M
181 guanidine HCl (GuHCl)14, hereafter referred to as “400/200/4” for brevity. Samples were
182 vortexed to mix, incubated at 75°C in a heat block overnight, then subsequently centrifuged at
183 15,000 rcf for 15 min and the 400/200/4 supernatant was collected. Fractions of 400/200/4 that
184 followed NaOH pretreatment were kept separate from those that had been incubated with
185 untreated bone to enable comparison. Supernatants were frozen at -80°C to await concentration.
186
187 Extract Concentration and Digestion
188
189 Supernatants were pooled into three distinct samples, each representative of the extract from
190 ~250 mg of bone powder (or five blank tubes): 1) 0.1 M NaOH (~5 ml of supernatant), 2)
191 400/200/4 that had been applied after the NaOH pretreatment (~3 ml, hereafter “NaOH-
192 400/200/4”), and 3) 400/200/4 from untreated bone (~3 ml). The NaOH and NaOH-400/200/4
193 samples, together, comprise “Method 1,” and the 400/200/4 sample from untreated bone
194 represents the sole incubation of “Method 2.” All samples were concentrated and buffer
195 exchanged at RT using 3 kDa MWCO centrifugal filters (Amicon-Ultra; Millipore). For each
196 sample, ~400 µL of supernatant was added to a filter, then centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 rcf.
197 The flow-through was then discarded and the process repeated in increments of 300 µL (to
198 accommodate sample held back in filter without overfilling to the lip of the seal) until all
199 supernatant (3–5 ml) had been concentrated into a single filter unit. Only one filter was used per
200 sample to reduce the adsorptive loss of protein on the filter membranes. After the last
201 centrifugation, filters containing concentrated sample received 300 µL of 50 mM ABC and were
202 then stored overnight at 4°C, in a humidity chamber wrapped in parafilm to prevent filters from
203 drying. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rcf for 30 min at RT, then buffer exchanged into 300
204 µL ABC twice more, mixing the ABC in the solvent reservoir of the filtration device prior to
205 centrifugation by pumping the solution in and out of the pipette tip several times to ensure the
206 whole sample had been mixed.
207
208 Concentrated samples were prepared for LC-MS/MS analysis using a modified version of the
209 standard filter aided sample preparation (FASP) protocol.16 Each sample received 50 µL of 10
210 mM DTT, were incubated in a heating oven at 60°C, then centrifuged at 14,000 rcf for 15 min,
211 followed by two exchanges of 200 µL of 8 M urea (in 100 mM Tris, pH 8.5) and centrifugation
212 for 15 min at 14,000 rcf. Samples were alkylated with 100 µL of 50 mM ioadacetamide (in 8 M
213 urea) for 20 min in the dark at RT, then incubated with 3 exchanges of 200 µL of 8 M urea
214 followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 rcf. Samples were then exchanged three times
215 into 300 µL of 50 mM ABC followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 14,000 rcf.
216
217 Filters were transferred into new collection tubes, and each sample received 500 ng of trypsin
218 solubilized in 50 µL of 50 mM ABC (well-mixed with the sample in the filter by pumping the
219 pipette as described above). Samples were allowed to digest overnight in a humidity chamber at
220 37°C in a heating oven. After digestion, filters were centrifuged at 14,000 rcf for 30 min. Then,
221 40 µL of 50 mM ABC were added to the filter, mixed with the pipette to suspend any sediment
222 at the bottom, and samples were centrifuged again at 14,000 rcf. This step was then repeated
223 twice, and the final filtered sample of ~150 µL was transferred to a new 1.5 ml Protein LoBind
224 centrifugation tube and received 3 µL of formic acid (FA) to quench any further digestion and
225 precipitate any remaining acid-insoluble humics out of solution while allowing peptides to
226 remain suspended.3 Samples were then frozen at -80°C to await stage-tipping.
227
228 Sample Purification and Concentration
229
230 Samples were stage-tipped using self-made tips following a protocol by Rappssilber et al.25, and
231 an adapted, centrifugal protocol proposed by Yu et al.17 Briefly, stage tips were assembled by
232 placing two discs of C18 membrane (Empore, 3M), perforated from a larger sheet with a blunt-
233 point, 16 gauge needle (I.D. 1.19 mm, Hamilton), in the tip of a 200 µL pipette tip (Figure S1A).
234 Stage tips were then placed in a collection tube made by perforating the top of a 1.5 ml Protein
235 LoBind tube with a heated glass pasture pipette (Fisher) (Figure S1B). By placing stage tips in
236 collection tubes (Figure S1C), multiple samples were stage tipped simultaneously and uniformly
237 using a centrifuge. Three stage-tip assemblies received 20 µL of methanol, then centrifuged for
238 30 s at 1,000 rcf. Tips were wetted with 20 µL of 80% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.2% FA followed by
239 centrifugation for 30 s at 1,000 rcf, then equilibrated with 20 µL of 0.2% FA and centrifuged for
240 1 min at 1,000 rcf. Tips were placed in new collection tubes, and each concentrated sample
241 (~150 µL each) was then passed through a stage tip by centrifugation at 1,000 rcf for 3 min. The

244 pass, the flow-through (2x filtered sample) was collected and stored at 80°C. Stage tips were then
247 washed with 40 µL of 0.2% FA, centrifuged for 2 min at 1,000 rcf, then the tips were moved to
248 new collection tubes and peptides were eluted with 20 µL of 80% ACN/0.2% FA. The peptide
249 elution step was repeated, resulting in a final sample volume of 40 µL. The final sample was
250 dried under vacuum centrifugation, then stored at -80°C until LC-MS/MS analysis could be
251 performed.
252
253 Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) Analysis
254
255 Samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS analysis using an Easy-nLC 1000 UHPLC (Thermo
256 Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Samples were
257 reconstituted in 25 µL of 0.1% FA, then 5 µL injections were loaded onto a new nanoViper nano
258 trap column (Thermo Scientific; I.D. 100 µm, 2 cm, PepMap C18, 5 µm particles) and in-line
259 separated with a new PicoFrit capillary column (New Objective; I.D. 75 µm x 25 cm) with an
260 integrated PicoTip emitter, packed in-house with Reprosil C18-AQ (3 µm) stationary phase
261 using a flow rate of 300 nl/min. For separation the following linear gradients were applied,
262 where mobile phase A is 0.1% FA and mobile phase B is 100% ACN/0.1% FA: t = 0 min, 0% B;
263 t = 1 min, 7% B; t = 120 min, 40% B; t = 121 min, 95% B, t = 136 min, 95% B. The MS
264 acquisition was performed in positive ion mode with the following parameters: the 10 most
265 intense precursor ions were fragmented using HCD (35% normalized collision energy); isolation
266 window was 3 m/z; precursor and product ion resolution was set to 60,000 and 15,000,
267 respectively; precursor scan range was m/z 400–2000; both precursor and product ions were
268 analyzed in the orbitrap. Dynamic exclusion was enabled, with a repeat count of 2, a repeat
269 duration of 30 s, and an exclusion duration of 120 s. Three injections of each sample were
270 performed, and identification results across these injections were combined for each sample.
271
272 Data Analyses
273
274 Raw data files from the LC-MS/MS acquisitions were processed using Proteome Discoverer
275 1.4.1.14 (Thermo Scientific) and searched against the NCBI Aves protein database (retrieved
276 May 19, 2015) using Mascot (Matrix Science, version 2.5) and X!Tandem (The GPM, version
277 CYCLONE 2010.12.01.1) using the following parameters: precursor mass tolerance = 10 ppm,
278 fragment ion tolerance = 0.02 Da; missed cleavages = 2; non-specific cleavage = one end; fixed
279 PTMs = carbamidomethylation (C); variable PTMs = oxidation (P), oxidation (K), deamidation
280 (NQ). X!Tandem searched the additional variable PTMs: Glu > pyro-Glu @N; Gln > pyro-Glu
281 @N; ammonia-loss @N. Protein/peptide identifications were validated in Scaffold (Proteome
282 Software, version Scaffold_4.8.6). Peptide identifications established at > 95% probability26
283 were accepted; protein identifications established at > 99% probability27 and containing at least 2
284 unique peptides were accepted.

286 RESULTS & DISCUSSION
287
288 Sample Clarity
289
290 Although the initial moa bone extract, particularly the 400/200/4 supernatants, were dark in color
291 even before concentration, the final MS-ready samples were nearly colorless (Figure 2) and
292 virtually indistinguishable from blank controls that were processed using (initially) empty tubes
293 as samples (Figure S2). Initial humic-containing supernatants (Figure 2, Row 1) became
294 increasing dark and opaque during concentration, and the flow-through during filtering was
295 markedly lighter than the portion of the supernatant held back in the filter (Figure 3).
296 Additionally, although 3 kDa MWCO, 500 µL Amicon Ultra filter units can concentrate 500 µL
297 samples into a ~30 µL volume (and did so in the negative controls), the in-filter volume of
298 concentrated 400/200/4 bone samples was approximately ~150 µL (Figure 3). These
299 observations indicate that the humic substances that co-extracted with the protein from the bone
300 largely remained in the filter instead of passing through, which is consistent with the reported
301 size of these substances (e.g., mostly >10 kDa3) and the findings of Szpack et al.2 that pre-
302 digestion ultrafiltration is not useful for separation of humics from protein extract. These humic
303 substances remained in the filter even after digestion using the FASP protocol, allowing
304 tryptically digested peptides (now = 3 kDa) to be separated from these substances when passed
E. Schroeter 11/28/2018 11:54 AM
305 through the filter during centrifugation. This separation was indicated by the drastic reduction in 315 Deleted: =
306 color and opaqueness between the concentrated samples before (Figure 3) and after (e.g., Figure
307 2E-F) digestion.
308
309 Post-FASP (and pre-stage tip) concentrated samples, while lighter in color than the initial
310 extracts, still possessed some coloration, suggesting that some humic and/or other substances that
311 might cause interference in MS were still present. Subsequent stage tipping of the samples
312 removed these last vestiges of color, and the final eluted samples were nearly colorless (Figure 2,
313 Row 3).
314
316 Notably, although NaOH pretreatment has been reported as an effective method of removing
317 humic substances from fossil bone,2 the single NaOH pretreatment incubation employed here
318 was not effective at removing a substantial amount of humics from the moa bone prior to protein
319 solubilization, as evidenced by the pale color of this fraction (Figure 2A), and the lack of
320 difference in color between pretreated and non-pretreated 400/200/4 fractions (Figure 2B-C).
321 This difference may be because Szpack et al.2 applied the NaOH treatment to demineralized
322 bone, whereas we applied it directly to ground bone powder.
323
324 Mass Spectrometry
325
326 Across all injections of moa extractions analyzed by LC-MS/MS, 20 bone proteins were
327 identified, including eight collagen alpha chains (six different collagen types) and 12 non-
328 collagenous proteins (NCPs) (Table 1). The total number of unique peptides, total peptide
329 spectral matches (PSMs), and sequence coverage for each fraction and method by protein are
330 listed in Supplementary Table 2. Only keratins (and no bone proteins) were identified in any of

331 the blank (reagent) control extract injections. 339 Deleted: (
E. Schroeter 11/28/2018 3:35 PM
332 340 Deleted: 1)
333 Nearly all the proteins identified were recovered from both methods, which shared 18 of the 20
334 proteins (Table 1). The exceptions were periostin, which was only found in the “NaOH-
335 400/200/4” fraction of Method 1, and prolargin, which was found in the “400/200/4 only”
336 extract, or Method 2. However, because these proteins were both identified by a relatively low
337 number of PSMs from their respective fractions (3–4 PSMs; Table 1), this is likely a stochastic
338 variation caused by data dependent acquisition28 and not a true difference between the methods.
341 In fact, when the number of unique (non-overlapping) peptides and percent sequence coverage
342 identified from each protein is considered, the results from Methods 1 and 2 are nearly identical,
343 with only slight variations that do not consistently favor either method (Figure 4). This suggests
344 that both methods recover roughly the same subset of the moa bone proteome.
345
346 When the two fractions of Method 1 are considered separately, the “NaOH-400/200/4” fraction
347 contains all the proteomic diversity obtained by this method; analysis of the “NaOH”
348 pretreatment extract did not identify any unique proteins compared to the subsequent fraction
349 (Table 1). Although the “NaOH” fraction possessed a greater number of collagen I PSMs than
350 the NaOH-400/200/4 fraction (Table 1), the number of unique peptides and percent sequence
351 coverage for all proteins were either substantially greater in the NaOH-400/200/4 fraction, or
352 roughly equal between the two (STable 1). This suggests that unlike demineralization
353 treatments,15 the NaOH pretreatment is not extracting a different subset of proteomic information
354 than the following solubilization step. Further, the nearly identical results obtained from the
355 pretreated (NaOH-400/200/4) and non-treated (400/200/4) fractions (Table1 and STable 1)
356 indicate that NaOH pretreatment under these conditions does not improve the capacity of the
357 400/200/4 to solubilize proteins from the bone matrix.
358
359 Efficiency and Modifications
360
361 Previous LC-MS/MS analyses of this fossil produced sequences of collagen I, collagen II, and
362 collagen V.22 The current method resulted in 15 additional proteins, including 12 NCPs, which
363 ranged from 1.3% to 18.4% sequence coverage for a given protein (STable 1, Figure 4B). This
364 represents a substantial improvement over the previous study, which used a more common HCl
365 demineralization followed by ammonium bicarbonate solubilization, and utilized an entire gram
366 of fossil tissue as opposed to 250 mg.22 A direct comparison of the HCl-ABC method employed

368 the observed increase in efficiency from the various differences in their workflows (e.g.,
369 extraction buffers, MS instrument, column packing) and to fully account for possible intra-bone
370 variation in protein preservation in this specimen.29-30 Regardless, this combined workflow
371 obtained 15 additional proteins previously unreported for this specimen, supporting its overall
372 improvement in recovery.
373
374 The design of this protocol as described here could potentially be modified to suit the needs of
375 individual studies. For example, we used conical 3 kDa MWCO ultrafilters (Milipore), to ensure
376 that small bone proteins or protein fragments were not potentially being lost. However,
377 researchers that utilize 10 kDa MWCO filters for their studies (e.g.,19-20) might consider using
378 flat-bottomed filters, as there is some evidence that flat-bottomed ultrafilters may produce better
379 results by eliminating the dead space in the bottom of the filter.31 Additionally, larger centrifugal
380 filters (e.g., 2 ml or 4 ml) may be used to reduce the concentration time, though the depth of the
381 larger filters may be more difficult for performing FASP.
382
383 CONCLUSIONS
384
385 The method presented here combined a non-demineralization extraction buffer,14 filter-aided
386 concentration and digestion of extracts, and a centrifugal stage tip protocol17 to successfully
388 concentrate protein extracts from a moa fossil inferred from their dark color to have a high humic

390 interference from these substances. These analyses produced peptides from 20 bone proteins, 15

392 approach.22 Because this workflow allows MS analyses of low-abundance proteins in fossils with

396 Although NaOH has been shown to aid in the removal of humic substances from a fossil bone
397 pellet that has been demineralized with HCl prior to NaOH treatment,2 we found that a version of
398 this method that incorporates a NaOH pre-treatment step to the protocol (Method 1) does not
399 remove more humics, recover more proteins, or recover a substantially greater portion of the
400 sequence of any protein than the method utilizing only 400/200/4 (Method 2). This indicates that
401 NaOH pretreatment is not effective for humic removal in methods that utilize non-
402 demineralizing14 solubilization reagents to avoid loss of NCPs in the demineralization fraction.15
403 We therefore recommend Method 2, as it produces nearly identical results with less cost in terms
404 of time, supplies, and instrument fees.

Appendix B
We thank both reviewers for their comments and suggestions. Below, we have detailed the edits
we’ve made to the manuscript.
Reviewer: 2
There are inconsistencies between different statements in the materials and methods section. For
example, on page 6 it is stated that the bone sample was divided into 10 aliquots of which 5 were
treated with NaOH and then all 10 samples were treated with the 400/200/4 solution. But on the
following page (p7) it is stated that there were three sample sets, one of which had NaOH but no
400/200/4 treatment, which is inconsistent with the description given on the preceding page.
Figure 1 is of little help in undestanding the experimental protocol. Overall, this article if revised
could make a useful contribution to the palaeoproteomics literature but as submitted I think that
it fails to meet the journal's requirement that published work should be "scientifically sound, in
which the methodology is rigorous and the conclusions fully supported by the data."
We apologize for the lack of clarity on how our sample sets were obtained. First, we will explain
here where we think the confusion arose from:
This paper tests two different methods for extraction.
• Method 1: incubates 5 aliquots of bone in NaOH, then collects and pools that NaOH.
Then, the 400/200/4 solution is added to the same 5 aliquots of NaOH-treated bone,
which is then collected and pooled into a separate sample. This generates 2 types of
samples; a NaOH sample that was incubated with fresh, untreated bone (because it was
the first step), and a 400/200/4 sample that is derived from the same, now NaOH-treated
bone.
• Method 2: incubates 5 aliquots of fresh, untreated bone in the 400/200/4 solution and
collects it. This generates 1 type of sample, a 400/200/4 sample that is derived from fresh,
untreated bone.
Overall, Method 1 generates two sample types (NaOH treatment and NaOH-400/200/4
treatment) and Method 2 only one sample type (400/200/4 treatment). This is how we generated
3 sample types from 2 methods, and this is how we have a sample that has NaOH with no
400/200/4—it is generated as part of a two step method in which the first step (NaOH) and the
second (400/200/4) are analyzed separately. Importantly, the NaOH-400/200/4 sample generated
by this method does not combine the NaOH fraction and the 400/200/4 fraction of Method 1, it is
only labeled this way to distinguish the 400/200/4 sample from bone that has had a NaOH pre-
treatment from the 400/200/4 sample from bone that did not have the NaOH pre-treatment
(Method 2).
We agree this has the potential to be confusing, and is not elucidated by the workflow figure we
provided previously. Thus, to illustrate the origin of these three samples more plainly, we have
added the following diagram and figure caption to the supplemental material:
Figure S1. Diagram of proteomic samples generated by this study. (A) Method 1: 5 aliquots of
50 mg ground moa bone powder were incubated in 0.1 M NaOH. The NaOH supernatant was
subsequently collected and concentrated into a single sample, “NaOH.” These NaOH-treated
bone pellets were then incubated in 400/200/4 solution, which was collected and concentrated
into a second sample, “NaOH-400/200/4.” This label denotes that it was generated from bone
that received 400/200/4 after pretreatment with NaOH. (B) Method 2: 5 aliquots of 50 mg
ground moa bone powder were incubated directly in 400/200/4. The 400/200/4 supernatant was
subsequently collected and concentrated into a solitary sample, “400/200/4.”
To direct readers to this diagram, we have added the following sentence to the first paragraph of
the “Protein Extraction” section (lines 130-131):
“Supplementary Figure 1 illustrates a diagram of supernatant collection steps and sample
generation for each method.”
We hope that this figure, combined with the previously provided workflow diagram and
supplementary table detailing the steps of the procedure, is sufficiently clear for all readers.
Reviewer 3
I have reviewed the revisions made by the authors in order to address the first round of reviews.
The authors have responded in an adequate way to all queries.
I do not wish to add any more comments as it would not be fair on the authors, but I would
strongly suggest to change the title as follows "A proteomic method to extract, concentrate,
digest and enrich peptides from from sub-fossil bones with colored (humic) substances for mass
spectrometry analyses". This is because: a) the paper only deals with bone, which has different
characteristics than other substrates for paleoproteomics (for example skipping demineralization
is not appropriate in all cases); b) "fossil" is a difficult word and often implies no organics and
old age - using "sub-fossil" is useful to indicate that you do have organics; c) "abundant" still
implies quantitation, which is not available in the paper; d) technically the authors do not provide
chemical evidence that the colored substances are in fact "humics" - better to focus on the color
aspect.
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and have adopted most of these comments into the
new title:
“A proteomic method to extract, concentrate, digest, and enrich peptides from fossils with
colored (humic) substances for mass spectrometry analyses”
We agree with the reviewer that “fossil” is a difficult word. There is not really a consensus in the
paleo community whether “fossil” implies the complete lack of organics, or how much time can
be encompassed by the term “sub-fossil.” Thus, we are concerned that if we use the term “sub-
fossil” it will give readers the mistaken impression that this method is only applicable to very
recently extinct species (i.e., the moa itself, as this sample is only 1000 years old). Because
proteomic methods are increasingly applied to specimens tens to hundreds of thousands of years
old without controversy, which few would categorize as “sub-fossil,” we think it is more
appropriate to leave the term “fossil” in the title. We have made the other changes in both the
main text and the supplement.
Appendix C
We thank the reviewer for their comments and suggestions. Below, we have detailed the
edits we’ve made to the manuscript in accordance with their recommendations.

Comments to the Author(s)
In the manuscript entitled "A proteomic method to extract, concentrate, digest, and enrich
peptides from fossils with colored (humic) substances for mass spectrometry analyses",
Schroeter and co-authors describe an protocol to extract ancient protein residues from
bone samples highly infiltrated with coloured (humic) substances. As the authors point
out, the challenge the method aims at addressing is significant. The study clearly
describes how the method presented clearly leads to higher recoveries in terms of
proteins peptides and PSMs. In the current version the manuscript is clearly readable, the
experimental protocol is described with enough detail to guarantee its reproducibility and
the literature review is pertinent and exhaustive. The evidence presented is solid and
reliable and it fully supports the conclusions reported. I have no major comments, just a
very few minor suggestions to marginally improve clarity.
Line 121: "Two extraction methods were tested; one that..." could be replaced with: "Two
extraction methods were tested: one that..."
The semicolon in line 121 has been replaced with a colon.
It could be useful to specify the pH of some of the buffers and solutions used for sample
preparation, e.g. ABC.
We agree, and have added the following pH information to the methods section:
• The pH for the 0.1 M NaOH solution has been added to line 127. The sentence
now reads: Five tubes of each set received 1 ml of 0.1 M NaOH (pH ~12.8), were
vortexed to mix, then were incubated at 4°C for 4 h with rocking.
• The pH for the 400/200/4 solution has been added to line 144. The sentence now
reads: “All 10 aliquots of bone powder then received 600 µL of a solution14
containing 400 mM ammonium phosphate diabasic (APD), 200 mM ammonium
bicarbonate (ABC), and 4 M guanidine HCl (GuHCl) (pH 8.2), hereafter referred
to as “400/200/4” for brevity.”
• The pH for the 50 mM ABC solution has been added to line 164. The sentence
now reads: After the last centrifugation, filters containing concentrated sample
received 300 µL of 50 mM ABC (pH 7.8) and were then stored overnight at 4°C,
in a humidity chamber wrapped in parafilm to prevent filters from drying.
Line 194: "... an adapted, centrifugal..." could be replaced with: "... an adapted
centrifugal...".
The comma between ‘adapted’ and ‘centrifugal’ in line 194 has been removed.
Line 317: The title "Efficiency and Modifications" is in my opinion a bit vague and does
not effectively describe the content of the following paragraph. I suggest to replace it
with something a bit more specific, such as: "Efficiency and Possible Variations of the
Experimental Workflow".
We agree, and have changed this heading (line 317) to the following:
“Efficiency and Potential Variations of the Experimental Workflow”
Globally, I think the authors did a very good job.
We thank the reviewer for their time and insights!
