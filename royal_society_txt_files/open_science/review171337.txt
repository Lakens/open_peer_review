Guo et al. built a junction DNA nanostructure consisting of G-rich and C-rich component strands
that can form G-quadruplex and i-motif upon addition of K+ and proton. The authors employed
PAGE, CD, and AFM to demonstrate the structural changes. Here are my suggestions.
(1) The PAGE results are quite poor. In Figure 3a, there are broaden bands in lanes 2-3. It
indicates that the two structure unites are not so stable. Why? How to improve it?
(2) Figure 3, what are samples 2-6? I guess they are those in Figure 2. However, it' difficult to read
the manuscript in such a organization. I suggest the authors indicate them in Figure 1.

This manuscript reports a molecular switch based on DNA duplex-quadruplex transition. It is
trigger by the change of solution pH value and cations. The authors have characterized the switch
via multiple techniques: PAGE, CD spectra, and AFM imaging. The structural transition (the
main claim) is clearly observed. It is a solid study. It is conceivable to apply this strategy to more
complicated DNA nanostructures or be exploited for biosensing.
One minor comment: In Fig S2 (a), all features in the images have similar shape and orientation.
This referee believe that this similarity is an artifacts. Though it won’t affect the conclusion, the
authors may consider delete this image as it doesn’t positively add any to this manuscript.

Dear Dr. Power,
Please find attached a revised version of our manuscript “Construction of a junction
DNA nanostructure and modulation of the junction switching to quadruplexes”, which
we would like to resubmit for publication as a research article in Royal Society Open
Science.
We are grateful to you and two reviewers. The comments to our manuscript are highly
valuable that enabled us to improve the quality of our manuscript greatly. The
following pages are our point-by-point responses to each of the comments of the
reviewers. Revisions in the text are shown using red highlight for additions and
changes. In accordance with reviewer 1’s suggestion, the Native-PAGE experiment
was resumed and extra experimental data were provided to demonstrate the structural
switch from "duplex + quadruplex"-typed DNA nanostructures to junction DNA
nanostructures. We hope that the revisions in the manuscript and our accompanying
responses will be sufficient to make our manuscript suitable for publication in Royal
Society Open Science.
This manuscript has been proofed by all of authors previously and there are no
conflicts of interest.
We shall look forward to hearing from you at your earlier convenience.
Sincerely yours,

First of all, we sincerely thank the editor and two reviewers for their valuable
feedback that we have used to improve the quality of our manuscript.
NOTE: The revised contents in the manuscript were highlighted in red. Our responses
were written in BLUE just after each comment (BLACK) of the reviewers. The
revised content of manuscript was shown briefly following our response.
Reviewer1:
(1) The PAGE results are quite poor. In Figure 3a, there are broaden bands in lanes
2-3. It indicates that the two structure unites are not so stable. Why? How to improve
it?
Response: We feel great thanks for your professional review work on our article.
According to the report in literatures [Chapter 1: Synthesis and characterization of
self-assembled DNA nanostructures in the book of DNA Nanotechnology-methods
and protocols: P1-P11&J. Zhou et al. / Methods 67 (2014) 159–168], the band
smearing may be caused by different reasons, including the loading rate of samples,
floating color of the dye and selection of proper power during the electrophoresis (3
W/gel or less), etc. Hence, we resumed the Native-PAGE experiment at 100 V (˜3.2
W) for 3.5 h and then destained the gels in distilled water for 8 min, which obtained
relatively satisfied PAGE results, as shown in the following Figure.
Figure 3. 8% native PAGE images of the mentioned DNA samples; (a) lane 1: a molecular
mass ladder with 20 bp step ladder from 20 bp to 200 bp and 100 bp step ladder from 200 bp
to 500 bp; lanes 2, 3 and 4 correspond to DNA samples 1, 2 and 3; (b) lanes 1 and 2: DNA
samples 5 and 6; lane 3: DNA sample 4; lane 4: the molecular mass ladder
(2) Figure 3, what are samples 2-6? I guess they are those in Figure 2. However, it's
difficult to read the manuscript in such an organization. I suggest the authors indicate
them in Figure 1.
Response: We sincerely thank the reviewer for careful reading. As suggested by the
reviewer, the DNA samples (from 1 to 6) have been indicated in Figure 1 caption.
Figure 1. Schematic descriptions of (a) a four-way junction structure, (b) designed slipped
junction structures, DNA samples 1 and 2; (c) the DNA nanostructure assembled by two
slipped junction structures in pH 6.7 lithium acetate solution, DNA sample 3; (d)"duplex +
quadruplex"-typed DNA nanostructures generated from the structural switch of the junction
DNA nanostructure in pH 4.5 potassium acetate solution, DNA sample 4 contains two kinds
of newly generated nanostructures: “duplex + i-motif”-typed (DNA sample 5) and “duplex +
G-quadruplex”-typed DNA nanostructures (DNA sample 6).
(3) Figure 5, How did the structure switch work? There are no data to demonstrate it.
Response: We are truly grateful to your critical comments and thoughtful suggestions.
It has been known that the dissociation of i-motif and G-quadruplex stabilized by K+
could be realized by the alkaline environment [23] and the addition of
18-crown-6-ether [30], respectively. Here, to simplify the experiment, we directly
mixed two C-rich and two G-rich strands at the rate of 1: 1 in 50 mM LiOAc buffer
(pH 6.7), respectively. They were annealed for 4 days to obtain the dissociated
structures of “duplex + quadruplex”-typed DNA nanostructures, and then the two
samples were mixed using the same method for mixing DNA samples 1 and 2. As
shown in Figure S2, the yield of mismatched DNA nanostructures for the DNA
sample 7 is less than that generated by the DNA sample 3, and more species around
60 bp seem to be formed, which may be due to the formation of interlocked duplexes
or other complex DNA structures. These results also indicate a low structural
conversion efficiency from "duplex + quadruplex"-typed DNA nanostructures to
junction DNA nanostructures.
We also studied the possibility of the structural switch from "duplex + quadruplex"-typed
DNA nanostructures to junction DNA nanostructures. Since the i-motif and G-quadruplex
stabilized by K+ could be dissociated by the alkaline environment [23] and the addition of
18-crown-6-ether [30], respectively. Here, to simplify the experiment, we separately mixed the
two C-rich and the two G-rich strands at the rate of 1: 1 in 50 mM LiOAc buffer (pH 6.7) to
obtain the dissociated structures of “duplex + quadruplex”-typed DNA nanostructures. They
were annealed for four days, and DNA sample 7 was obtained by mixing the two samples
and using the same method for preparing DNA sample 3. The native-PAGE and AFM
experimental results indicated that more species around 60 bp seem to be formed for the
DNA sample 7 while the yield of mismatched DNA nanostructures is less than the DNA
sample 3 (Figure S2). This may be due to the formation of interlocked duplexes or other
complex DNA structures, as shown in Figure 5.
Figure S2. (a) the formation of junction DNA nanostructures with two mixing methods in 8%
native polyacrylamide gel, lane 1: DNA sample 3, lane 2: the molecular mass ladder, lane 3: DNA
sample 7 (the 1: 1 mixtures of two C-rich and two G-rich DNA strands were annealed respectively
in 50 mM LiOAc buffer at pH 6.7 for four days, and then the two samples were mixed and
equilibrated using the method for preparing DNA sample 3); (b) the AFM image with the scale bar
of 500 nm for various DNA structures assembled from the DNA sample 7
Figure 5. The possibility of structural switch from "duplex + quadruplex"-typed DNA
nanostructures to junction DNA nanostructures; two types of structures may be formed: the
junction DNA nanostructure (right up) and "closed" duplex DNA structure (right down)
(4) AFM is not so clear, especially the labels. Although we can conclude that the
structures are there from the AFM images, no clear structure shape is observed due to
the poor resolution.
Response: We sincerely appreciate the valuable comments. The resolution of AFM
images mainly depends on the precision of AFM probes. Here, to give clearer
structures, the labelled DNA structures in Figure 4 were enlarged with the scale bar of
200 nm and the Figure 4 has been reformatted in revised manuscript.

indicated with the blue arrow in Figure 4b, e and h, respectively; (c), (f) and (i) the height and
length profiles of the DNA samples 1, 3 and 4, respectively
Reviewer 2:
One minor comment: In Fig S2 (a), all features in the images have similar shape and
orientation. This referee believes that this similarity is an artifacts. Though it won’t
affect the conclusion, the authors may consider delete this image as it doesn’t
positively add any to this manuscript.
Response: Thank you very much for your positive comments and valuable
suggestions. According to your instructions, we have deleted the corresponding Figure
in Supplementary Material.
