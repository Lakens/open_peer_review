A key question is how to reduce deforestation via improving agricultural yields on existing
farmlands (i.e., spare land). This is an especially important question in oil palm production,
which is the most widely produced and rapidly expanding deforestation crop in the tropics.
This article illustrates yield gaps in small-holder oil palm, which represents a critical opportunity
to enhance yields and thus help to spare further deforestation by meeting demand through
improvements. The article then uses rigorous analyses to show why these yield gaps exist and
thus methods that can be used to close yield gaps. There is an appropriate discussion of their
findings and notes on mechanisms that can be applied to improve small-holder yields. I find this
to be a very well conducted and presented study, and congratulate the authors. My comments are
all very minor.
L46-50 rewrite as follows: ‘Land sparing involves intensifying land use for agricultural
commodities so as to minimize the area of land needed to meet demand, even though the
increased use of some agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers and insecticides, can have negative
impacts on local biodiversity and freshwater quality when compared to conventional practices
[14].’
Results - It would be good to repeat the acronyms here for clarity since there are quite a few to
remember.

The users may benefitted from this analysis.
However, the following comment may be useful to enhance the quality of the paper.
Response
We thank the reviewer for the comments. We have tried to address all of them below.

line 24. the keywords are recommended to be revised because most of them are less discussed in the
text. the selection of keyword is must base on the most highest 'word' in the overall discussion.
Response
We have changed the keywords to reflect better the discussion as suggested.
Action
The new keywords are:
biodiversity, efficiency analysis, Indonesia, land sparing, oil palm, smallholders

Response
We have downloaded and used the Royal Society Open Science Endnote citing style. We
note that more authors appear under this style but et al. is still used after 10 authors.
Comment
1. analysis can be divided into specific categories as per mentioned in the research title.
Response
We agree that sub-categories would help. We have added sub-sections to the results section
to help the reader identify the outcomes of the first and second stage data analyses.
Action
Two sub-section headings were added to results:

Website: www.dbs.nus.edu.sg
First stage data analysis: efficiency of production
Second stage data analysis: correlates of efficiency
Comment
2. the method must be included on how the survey was performed and any other significant influent if
the data just focus by monthly base.
Response
We have added more information on the randomization process of the survey in choosing the
respondents.
Action
The following text was added to the methods:
“Maps of main roads and landmarks were used in each village to locate random starting
points for transect lines that were followed to choose the households entering the study. The
head of the household responded to the survey unless the head was away [20].”
Comment
3. sub-section for conclusion is required to sum up the overall research findings.
Response
We agree and have identified the conclusions section with a new heading.
Comment
4. the future plan for research also recommended to highlight to show the contiunity work on the
research.

Website: www.dbs.nus.edu.sg
Response
We concur and describe now future research directions.
Action
The following text was added:
“Besides studying the land-use implications of closing yield gaps among Indonesian
smallholders in six villages, future research could attempt to widen the scope of the analysis
to smallholders and oil palm companies across the whole of Indonesia. An integrated network
of data collection and monitoring on inputs and outputs in oil palm production could help
improve management practices real-time via similar analytical methods to those we used
here. The inclusion of biodiversity levels in plantations as an output together with yields
could also help identify practices that both lead to production and environmental benefits
[e.g. 43]. In addition, further research could also investigate the factors affecting the
probability of a farmer joining industry schemes and ways to estimate the entrepreneurship
capacity of different smallholders.”
