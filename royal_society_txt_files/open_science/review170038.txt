Your experiment is still pseudoreplicated despite the fact that your setup hasn’t yet been
described in a methods paper. Your statement: “We are not aware of any existing system that
allows for stable (in equilibrium), independent aquarium pH control. If this is a new standard, no
papers simulating ocean acidification can be published” is incorrect and a lazy cop-out of my
original criticism. If you had bothered to read to Cornwall and Hurd (2015), as suggested, you
would have noticed that as of 2014, there were 27 published studies that employed an
appropriate experimental design in OA studies. Your setup is what Cornwall and Hurd (2015)
label “B-4”, or a setup that is randomized, but the replicates are interdependent within
treatments. Your statistical analyses are incorrect because you only have an n=2 for your
seawater pH treatments, which is insufficient replication.
The Cornwall and Hurd (2015) paper actually has an entire section that discusses how to solve
the pseudoreplication of your setup. You need to own this caveat in your paper and
transparently discuss this drawback in design.
The discussion of response to elevated temperature is now more appropriate, but something that
jumped out at me is that the maximum monthly mean temp (MMM) you reported in the previous
version of this manuscript has changed. In the prior version of the paper, you reported MMM as
27.2, which makes the threshold 28.2. However, in this version of the paper, the MMM value is
26.8? It doesn’t seem to be reported, I’m inferring from Figure 2b. Why has this changed?
Its also confusing that you say that pH was lowered once your ramped up temps exceeded the
MMM given that the original manuscript didn’t consider temperature stress in this way and the
MMM value you reported previously was different…

General Comments
This is a well-written manuscript where the coral Stylophora pistillata from the northern Red Sea
was subjected to end of century warming and acidification conditions in a fully factorial tank
experiment for several weeks. The authors demonstrated using an impressive number of
response variables that this coral species is highly resistant to temperature and pH stress. This is
an interesting finding given that most corals respond to similar changes in temperature and OA
with severe bleaching and declines in calcification, respectively. Although it has been known that
corals in the northern Red Sea are unusually resistant to such conditions due to their unique
evolutionary history, this is the first study to highlight this resistance using realistic climate
change scenarios and an extremely comprehensive physiological approach. The authors have also
done a great job in describing the thermal history of these corals and putting the experimental
heat stress in the context of DHW and other relevant NOAA terminology (e.g. bleaching alert
level). Although I have some minor questions and comments, I believe that this manuscript
should be accepted provided that minor revisions are made.
Specific Comments
I think the word “resistant” would be more appropriate in the title and throughout the
manuscript. The term resilience is really over-used in the literature and typically not used in the
appropriate context or according to its definition. This applies throughout the manuscript as the
two terms seem to be used interchangeably (e.g. lines 345-351).
Abstract
I think it would be important to add that there were no declines in calcification due to low
seawater pH.
L30: I’m not sure what you mean by morphometrics?
Introduction
L56: what do you mean by the “mosaic nature” of the coral holobiont? Also, holobiont should be
defined.
L65: Many corals have much lower bleaching tresholds, e.g. on subtropical reefs.
L90: a dot is missing at the end of the sentence.
L92: please define GoA before using this acronym
Methods
L122: please state the length of the photo-period in the text and the kind of lights that were used.
L168: please clarify whether corals were dark-acclimated before doing the respiration incubations
L199: please define CV
4
Discussion
I think it should be briefly discussed here that corals were kept at one fifth of ambient light levels.
I’m not sure why this was the case but given that photosynthesis was saturated under these
conditions, I don’t see any problem with this. However, these lower than ambient light levels
could have contributed to the lack of a heat stress response and this should be discussed. Again, I
don’t doubt that these corals are unusually resistant to high temperatures but light plays a big
role in mitigating or exacerbating heat stress.
L450: Stylophora pistillata should be in italics and the genus name could be abbreviated.
L452: should be “stems”
L454/455: why only list pCO2 here?
Supplement
The choice of units for reporting seawater carbonate chemistry is somewhat unusual (e.g.
microequivalents kg-1 or pH on NBS scale). Please review the recommendations in the OA Best
Practice Guide as pH, for example, should be reported on the total scale.

Summary:
Krueger et al. studied the physiology of the reef-building coral Stylophora pistillata and its
photosynthetic symbionts in the Gulf of Aqaba. Presumably, this population evolved strong
thermotolerance in the past as it migrated through the Red Sea, and currently experiences
temperatures below its thermal maximum. While such corals have been discussed as potentially
5
resilient to climate change, few studies have investigated both host and symbiont physiology to
explore the mechanisms behind such tolerance.
Krueger et al. found that the corals do in fact feature unprecedented thermotolerance, capable of
withstanding temperature and pH changes that lead to mortality in most other populations.
Interestingly, the coral symbionts actually performed better under the stress treatments, and host
physiology did not change significantly. These results imply that corals in the Gulf are capable of
persisting longer under climate change than other populations, making them a conservation
priority.
Recommendation:
This is a solid body of work; well-written, novel findings, timely, and relevant for the journal’s
readership (particularly reef scientists, but also anyone interested in the impacts of climate
change on biological systems). My assessment is short because I see that the manuscript has
already gone through several rounds of review. The authors have addressed these earlier
comments and I have little to add. I’ve noted a few minor points where additional clarification
would be helpful. Otherwise, the data seem solid and support the main conclusions, so I
recommend publication without further revision.
Minor edits:
L120: Acclimated at what temperature?
L139: Clarify the gradual increase in temperature if possible (e.g. 1C per day?)
L142: Check the date here; I think you mean 22/04/14
L146: Please provide the control temperatures in the text here.
L334: This is nitpicky, but with so much variability I’d phrase this section differently. An average
“reduction of 6% (+26% to -30%)” seems silly. Instead I’d say “an average change of -6% (+26%
to -30%).”

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have appropriately addressed my concerns
We appreciate the comments made by the reviewers in this second round and have modified the paper
accordingly. However, we point out that the first reviewer’s comment about laziness is unjustified and
frankly unprofessional; especially considering the extremely large body of systematic work that our
study represents, which makes it quite unique.
We hope that this version of the paper satisfies the requirements for acceptance and look forward to
hearing from you again soon.

Reviewer comments
Reviewer 1:
Design comment
We appreciate the great expertise of the reviewer regarding the experimental design. In response, we
have amended the M&M section and now explicitly point to the design layout based on Cornwall & Hurd
(2015), and provide information on testing the pH mixing tank effect for a subset of the data:
Line 140-145: “Note that this experiment represents a randomized setup, but replicates are
interdependent within the pH treatment factor (sensu B-4 design; [27]) and independent pH treatment
replication is thus N=2. However, we demonstrate the absence of mixing tank effects in the low pH
treatment by testing main physiological variables of the DEF triplet (chosen randomly; mixing tank 1
supply) against the GHI triplet (mixing tank 2 supply) in a balanced Two-Way ANOVA (Fig. S2, Table
S6).”
Thus, we now demonstrate the absence of any consistent effect of mixing tank in the low pH treatment
in a separate analysis for all the main physiological variables.
Temperature and pH comment:
These comments rest on a misunderstanding. The MMM is based on the complete available temperature
record (in our case 30 years), thus it is slightly lower than the previously used current 10-year summer
maximum, because summer temperatures were lower in the past (see Fig. S1).
Reviewer 2:
Title comment: We agree on the specific issue with the term “resilience” and have replaced it with
“resistance” throughout the manuscript.
Abstract comment: There were declines in calcification as can be seen in Fig. 3; however, they were not
statistically significant. For this reason, we do not feel that it deserves a place in the abstract.
L. 30. The word has been removed since the term morphometrics strictly refers to shape-related
parameters. We meant to use it in the context of overall colony appearance (pigmentation as product of
Chl content and symbiont density).
L. 56. The term “holobiont” has been defined now and it should become clear that the different
combination of host species, symbiont genotypes, and microbial communities that define the
superorganism coral can be viewed as a mosaic.
L. 65. Agreed. But, the 1-2°C bleaching threshold refers primarily to tropical corals. We have added the
word “tropical”
L. 90. Thanks.
L. 92. Done.
L. 122. Done. The corals were kept outdoors as line 117 indicates.
L. 168. We are aware of the issue of light-enhanced dark respiration. Corals were first incubated in the
light followed by darkness. However, for the respiration slopes only the linear part with the maximum
slope was used (typically 30-40 min at the end of the total incubation time). The text was revised to
make this clear.
L. 199. CV is the coefficient of variation. As this seems to be ambiguous, we have changed this to
SD/mean, assuming that SD for standard deviation is common knowledge.
Discussion of lower light: Raising this point is justified. However, a very recent systematic study on the
same coral in the same location (Bellworthy, Fine et al. under revision in Coral Reefs Journal) has
addressed this and shown that the light levels used in this study do not in any way affect the bleaching
process.
L. 450. Done.
L. 452. Thanks.
L. 454/455. The text was altered to refer to the general terms of ocean warming and acidification now.
Supplement comment: We have changed the units accordingly. Since pH meters that monitored the
system were calibrated with pH NBS buffers, a conversion to the total scale was done for Fig S1 by
subtracting -0.11 pH units from the pHNBS value (Zeebe and Wolf-Gladrow, 2001). We have added a
description of this to the Extended M&M section in the supplements.
Reviewer 3.
L. 120. Corals were acclimated to the aquarium setting with ambient flow-through seawater. The text
has been slightly altered to make this clearer.
L. 139. The actual temperature ramp can be seen in Fig. 2. Temperature was ramped quicker in the
beginning to reach the range of typical summer temperatures and then slowed down. A precise ramping
rate cannot be provided, due to the daily temperature variations. The system ultimately maintained a
delta in temperature between ambient and elevated treatment of ca. 5°C.
L. 146. Done.
L. 334. Thank you for the suggestion. The text was altered accordingly.
