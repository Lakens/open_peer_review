Excellent job all around on getting these important new data from a difficult to interpret
specimen. I would select "publish as is" but in the discussion of heterodonty the authors choose to
highlight the later occurring (Permain) Pantylus but neglect the earlier (Westphalian) microsaurs
from Joggins and Nyrany that show some heterodonty. It doesn't really take away from the
substance of the discussion but the timing would shave some time off between them and
Acherontiscus. I am pleased to see the tetrapod stem group continues to gather these little guys
and increased morphological disparity, but I think all would agree we have a lot more anatomy
to describe and specimens to find before that part of the tree topology will stabilize.

This is an important paper, well written and I support its publication. However, I do have some
recommendations that I think would improve it.
In particular, they relate to the phylogenetic analysis section and the discussion. Also, some
changes to the figures are recommended.
Phylogenetic analysis: How does inclusion of Acherontiscus in the Pardo et al. (2018) data matrix
effect that tree topology? It is generally unhelpful if previous publications and analyses of early
tetrapod phylogenies are largely ignored, as you do here. I would suggest that the issue of how
Acherontiscus fits in the analysis of Pardo et al Nature paper should be discussed. The tree
3
topology of that analysis is very different from what is presented here, and I am wondering how
does Acherontiscus fit into that tree, especially since the main topic of that paper is another
limbless early tetrapod.
Discussion:
1) I highly recommend using the CT data for analyzing the dental morphology of the large teeth.
Since it is not possible to do thin sections of the dentary teeth, I am strongly recommending
visualizing the “durophagous” teeth in cross and vertical section using the tomographic data.
Internal anatomy of the teeth should provide information about whether this represents teeth that
are designed to break through hard tissues. If they have thick dentine, then you would have a
very strong case for durophagy.
2) I agree that the combination of heterodonty and durophagy is rare in amphibians and their
stem group, but size based heterodonty is known in trematopids, but of course no durophagous
dentition. I would mention that.
3) Discussion from line 250-254 is a bit too simplistic. Heterodonty is widespread in early
amniotes and stem amniotes, not just synapsids, as you well know. It is a widespread
phenomenon among eureptiles, parareptiles, and even early diapsids (e.g. Araeoscelis) and
beyond. So, I would restructure this portion of the discussion to include early non-synapsid
amniotes and some microsaurs in this segment.
Figures and figure captions:
Figure 1 has two (c), please correct. Please identify/label the teeth in Fig. 1c (d).
I am also not in favor of the abbreviations used in this manuscript. The more commonly used
codings are: f-frontal, l-lacrimal, m-maxilla, pmx-premaxilla, l-lacrimal, p-parietal, qj-
quadratojugal, pt-pterygoid, etc. (this is the style of A.S. Romer and others for tetrapods and
amniotes). Sorry, I am betraying my NA prejudice, but I think these figure labels are more
compact and still informative.
What is lr, lower?? This is only part of labels used in figures and, and is therefore confusing. I
personally find the use of -L lr jaw- inappropriate.
More importantly, if you can reconstruct completely the lower jaws and much of the skull, you
should be able to label the constituent bones in figures 1 and 2. Same for the reconstructions. This
is important for the more general reader, since only a handful of readers would know the
difference between the coronoids, angular, surangular, etc. These are reconstructed but not
labelled.

Comments to the Author:
Dear Prof Clack,
Thank you for your submission to RSOS. Both reviewers find the paper to be well written and
support its publication and I am therefore very happy to recommend its publication subject to
minor revisions. The requested revisions are very minor in the most part. Reviewer 2 queries the
choice of phylogenetic matrix (and highlights Pardo et al 2018 as an alternative). I would suggest
that in the revised manuscript that the taxon is added to that matrix as well as the one already
analysed, or more simply still, a statement is added to the MS to justify your choice of your
updated former matrix over that of Pardo et al 2018.
I look forward to receiving those revisions.

I think all would agree we have a lot more anatomy to describe and specimens

Response: The time difference we mentioned refers specifically to the
crown amniote Opisthodontosaurus, as being the most comparable
type of heterodonty and durophagy. We have added 'Late
Carboniferous' at line 201, to cover the microsaurs.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
This is an important paper, well written and I support its publication.
However, I do have some recommendations that I think would improve it.
In particular, they relate to the phylogenetic analysis section and the
discussion. Also, some changes to the figures are recommended.
Phylogenetic analysis: How does inclusion of <i>Acherontiscus</i> in the
Pardo et al. (2018) data matrix effect that tree topology? It is generally
unhelpful if previous publications and analyses of early tetrapod phylogenies
are largely ignored, as you do here. I would suggest that the issue of how
<i>Acherontiscus</i> fits in the analysis of Pardo et al <i>Nature</i> paper
should be discussed. The tree topology of that analysis is very different from
what is presented here, and I am wondering how does <i>Acherontiscus</i>
fit into that tree, especially since the main topic of that paper is another
limbless early tetrapod.
Response: We used our previous matrix rather than that of Pardo et al.
for a number of reasons. First, our data includes new and unique data
on a range of Tournaisian tetrapods that could not be included in
Pardo et al.. These taxa have thrown up some novel arrangements of
early tetrapod taxa (Clack et al. 2017). We further feel that our range of
taxa, with fewer more derived forms and including more basal forms is
the appropriate one for placing taxa from the Early Carboniferous. That
of Pardo et al. seems to us to be overbalanced with those more
derived taxa, including large groupings whose inter-relationships have
been relatively stable over time. This set of taxa and characters
swamps and rather undervalues the basal forms. We chose the range
of taxa we felt better reflected that from the Carboniferous, especially
the Early Carboniferous. It also includes more 'lepospondyls', whose
inter-relationships remain controversial, and with which Acherontiscus
has been previously associated.
Discussion:
1) I highly recommend using the CT data for analyzing the dental
morphology of the large teeth. Since it is not possible to do thin sections of the
dentary teeth, I am strongly recommending visualizing the “durophagous”
teeth in cross and vertical section using the tomographic data. Internal
anatomy of the teeth should provide information about whether this represents
teeth that are designed to break through hard tissues. If they have thick
dentine, then you would have a very strong case for durophagy.
Response: Unfortunately, although we had the specimen scanned in
the highest resolution microCT machine available in the UK (the NHM
Zeiss Versa), there was insufficient resolution to see cross sections of
the teeth. We do state something about the resolution in the text, but I
have added a phrase referring to the large teeth. Only a synchrotron
scanner would give us sufficient resolution, and we do not have
resources or ready access to such a machine. We absolutely agree
that it would be desirable to do this, and hope that some group will do
this in the future. They may also be able to make more sense of the
skull as a whole!
2) I agree that the combination of heterodonty and durophagy is rare in
amphibians and their stem group, but size based heterodonty is known in
trematopids, but of course no durophagous dentition. I would mention that.
Response: Trematopids and heterodonty. This person is not familiar with
temnospondyls. Phonerpeton as figured by Dilkes has a pseudocanine, but
similar disproportionately large marginal teeth can be found in the colosteid
Greererpeton, the dvinosaurian Erpetosaurus, and clumps of pseudocanines
can be found in Cochleosaurus, Eryops and many more. Balanerpeton had
different sized lowers and uppers. This type of heterodonty is widespread.
Response: Done
3) Discussion from line 250-254 is a bit too simplistic. Heterodonty is
widespread in early amniotes and stem amniotes, not just synapsids, as you
well know. It is a widespread phenomenon among eureptiles, parareptiles, and
even early diapsids (e.g. <i>Araeoscelis</i>) and beyond. So, I would
restructure this portion of the discussion to include early non-synapsid
amniotes and some microsaurs in this segment.
Response: Discussion of these groups occurs between lines 236 and
241. I have added trematopids on lines 242 and 243. I have mentioned
'microsaurs' at line 201-202 and changed 'recumbirostrans' for 'Late
Carboniferous'. (See also for Referee 2)
Figures and figure captions:
Figure 1 has two (c), please correct. Please identify/label the teeth in Fig. 1c
(d).
Response: Done
I am also not in favor of the abbreviations used in this manuscript. The more
commonly used codings are: f-frontal, l-lacrimal, m-maxilla, pmx-premaxilla,
l-lacrimal, p-parietal, qj-quadratojugal, pt-pterygoid, etc. (this is the style of
A.S. Romer and others for tetrapods and amniotes). Sorry, I am betraying my
NA prejudice, but I think these figure labels are more compact and still
informative.
Response: I am afraid that I (JAC) absolutely disagree with this
suggestion. I have used longer abbreviations for my entire career, as I
think they are generally easier for readers to understand without have
to go back to the abbreviations list. I seem to remember years ago that
someone said to me that there was a standard usage for
abbreviations, but I never found it to be the case among the papers I
read. Indeed, consider this. When I first started my career, and in times
previous to that, lettering on figures was manually added: by
handwritten labels; by attached type-written lettering; or by 'Letraset' or
its equivalent. Naturally, people needed the abbreviations to be a short
as possible. Now that we have software to do the job for us, we can
easily make them longer and more intuitive. If there is space, we
needn't use abbreviations at all, as I have done in some places.
What is lr, lower?? This is only part of labels used in figures and, and is
therefore confusing. I personally find the use of -L lr jaw- inappropriate.
Response: We are really not sure what the objection is. We have
corrected one of the labels in Figure 1 which needed an added space.
This objection is really just personal preference.
More importantly, if you can reconstruct completely the lower jaws and much
of the skull, you should be able to label the constituent bones in figures 1 and
2. Same for the reconstructions. This is important for the more general reader,
since only a handful of readers would know the difference between the
coronoids, angular, surangular, etc. These are reconstructed but not labelled.
Done, with proviso added in the legend. I have not added further labels
to Figure 1 apart from labelling the teeth in part c; otherwise I have
labelled all the bones whose identity we can be sure of.
