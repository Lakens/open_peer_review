General comments to the authors
This study "Body size–trophic position relationships among fishes of the
Lower Mekong Basin" quantifies the body size-trophic position relationship among fishes from
four rivers in the lower Mekong River. The authors evaluate this relationship across two habitat
categories (benthic and pelagic), four dietary categories (detritivores, invertivores, omnivores,
and piscivores), and three taxonomic orders (Cypriniformes, Percifromes, and Siluriformes).
There was a significant positive size-TP relationship in two of the four rivers (Sesan and Seprok),
in two of the three Orders (Perciformes and Siluriformes), and in two of the four guilds
(piscivores and omnivores). I think the results are intuitive and that the manuscript is well
written. I think the purpose of the study could be clarified in the introduction by providing the
rationale for using the chosen classifications (habitat and guild). For example, I assume that the
role of gape limitation is intuitively variable across the guilds, but this is not clearly presented in
the text. The representativeness of the sample (143 species) of the >1000 species in the lower
Mekong is not mentioned. If small/large taxa or particular guilds are poorly sampled, the
potential influence of that should be mentioned in the text. The vast majority of the sampled
species are cypriniforms and relatively few perciforms, is this consistent with the fractions of
those lineages that occur in the lower Mekong?
The authors also evaluated the influence of phylogeny on the body size-trophic position
relationship using phylogenetic distance and mantel tests. This was mentioned in the Methods
and the results were stated in the Results section, but these results were not interpreted in the
Discussion. What does it mean that phylogeny did not influence the size-TP relationship? I think
this is an interesting component to manuscript, but its importance should be addressed in the
Discussion.
Specific comments to authors
Summary
Page 2 (Lines 24-25): This sentence specifies that the Cypriniformes are species-rich and
ecologically diverse. Does this statement intend to use this to distinguish the Cypriniformes from
the Siluriformes and Perciformes? This sentence should be rephrased because the Perciformes are
the most speciose Order of vertebrates and arguably the most ecologically diverse. The
Siluriformes are also species-rich and ecologically diverse, so I’m not convinced that those are
factors that explain the different size-TP relationships among them. If you’re referring specifically
to the representation of these Orders in the Mekong basin, that needs to be clarified.
2 (27): “but not for detritivores and insectivores”… do you mean that they are not positive or
strong? Be more specific here. It’s not clear if that means they are not statistically significant, are
negative, or just not strongly positive.
Background
3 (52): I don’t think you need the comma after “associated”
3 (53-54): Is gape limitation an example of the morphological constraints mentioned in the
previous sentence? If so, I would reword to indicate that. If not, clarify why not.
3
4 (63): With the caveat that I do not have experience with applied ecology, it is not clear to me
how the relationship between body size and trophic position of the fish community would
inform resource management applications. I understand the functional aspect as described in the
last paragraph in the Discussion), but I can’t put together how this ultimately would influence
management decisions. If negative and positive relationships would result in different fishery
management strategies, this would be interesting and is worth clarification/explanation.
4 (70): It is not clear why gape limitation is mentioned here, especially since gape was not
measured in this study. This statement almost sounds as if gape limitation is being considered the
null expectation? I assume, that the role of gape limitation is highly dependent upon the trophic
guild classification (i.e., important among piscivores)? If this is the rationale for using the guild
classifications, that could be clarified in the text.
Methods
6 (122): I think that “standard values of atmospheric for nitrogen as dX” should be “standard
values for atmospheric nitrogen as dX”.
7 (128-129: I think that “is the signature of d15N fishes” should be “is the d15N signature of
fishes”
8 (153): Are these 143 species representative of the body size diversity and ecological diversity of
the >1000 species present in the Mekong? If so, this should be clarified. If not, potential
implications of unsampled taxa should mentioned in the Discussion.
8 (160-161): what correction for multiple comparisons were made during these statistical
procedures? I see that you mention it in the Results, but it should be clarified here.
10 (198): clarify that these relationships were positive.
Discussion
10 (209): Cypriniformes is the order, cypriniforms are the species within that order. Need to
rephrase or use Cypriniformes.
10 (212-213): I think “and representing broad range” should be “and also represent a broad
range”.
11 (219-226): Are there any ideas, maybe morphologically or physiologically, why cypriniforms
don’t appear to conform to the general positive size-TP relationship?
13 (264): I assume this may explain why the body sizes were significantly smaller in the Sesan? If
so, please specify that here while the topic is mentioned. This paragraph (261-268), may also be a
good place to mention possible reasons why the TP was significantly higher in the Mekong?
Supplementary Material
Add a column to the table that clarifies which river(s) the taxa are from. Also, including ±SD with
the mean for body size and trophic position will help readers evaluate the variation and range of
individuals included in the analyses. The meaning of the habitat and trophic guild letter codes
need to be defined in the legend.

The article submitted by Ou and coauthors analyze the trophic position-body size relationship in
fishes of four tropical rivers. The frequent claim for a generally positive association between body
size and trophic position is not supported on empirical and theoretical grounds, where a wide
range of empirical patterns was reported including positive, but also negative, no-association or
humped trends. Consequently, identifying determinants of the trophic position-body size
relationship (TP-M) may be a central aim in food web ecology. The present ms represent a
contribution to this aim. The authors reports the TP-M relationship in four rivers, showing that
the observed trend depends on the river, species’ habitat, and feeding guild considered;
accounting for the variation in observed TP-M relationship. In addition, the authors focus in
tropical rivers, which are comparatively under represented in the literature. In general, I enjoy
the time considering the present submission, which, in my opinion, represent a valuable
contribution.
I have some general comments:
I think that a weak point of the ms is the focus on gape limitation as the putative underling
mechanisms without explicit consideration of alternative mechanisms and its interaction with
ecosystem properties. In this sense, an explicit consideration of alternative mechanisms to gape
limitation may improve the framework for the present study—e.g. energetic constrains
(Benavides et al. 1994; Arim et al. 2007); and its relationship with ecosystem size, food web
diversity and availability of different energy sources (Layman et al. 2007; Arim et al. 2010);
species movement through the river (Arim et al. 2016) or the spatial and taxonomic level at which
the analysis is performed (Segura et al. 2015). This point should be considered in both
introduction and discussion. In addition, discussion almost exclusively focuses on the study
system with minor attention to the general theoretical framework.
One of the reason to be signing this review is because the attention to previous mechanisms could
be biased by my interests. Consequently, the suggested literature should be considered as an
arbitrary selection.
I think that the statistical approach could be improved. The expected association between trophic
position and body size could be more related to trends in maximum (Arim et al. 2007) or
minimum (Benavides et al. 1994) trophic position rather than to average values. In this sense, the
addition of analyses of percentiles regressions (see Cade et al. 2003) and segmented regression
(Segura et al. 2015) are strongly recommended. In addition, I strongly consider that the authors
may consider the use of mixed model or a single model combining all the tests. In a Mixed model
the river may be included as random effect (intercept and/or slope). However, if enough data are
available (I think that is the case) I strongly consider that a single lineal model is recommended.
In this model trophic position is the response variable and river, habitat, guild and body size are
5
the independent variables. Interactions between categorical variables and body size have to be
included. In addition, a quadratic term for body size may be also included because non-linear
trend is an expected pattern. The final model could be simplified by standard methods for model
selection (Zuur et al. 2009). Finally, the power of this model could be further improved
considering families as a random variable.
The analysis of the interrelationship among phylogeny, body size and trophic position is a main
contribution of the ms, but this is not considered in the abstract or introduction, it just appear in
methods. Even if the result is not statistically significant the attention to this lack of association
should be highlighted.

neral comments to the authors
s study "Body size–trophic position relationships among fishes of the
wer Mekong Basin" quantifies the body size-trophic position relationship among fishes from
r rivers in the lower Mekong River. The authors evaluate this relationship across two habitat
egories (benthic and pelagic), four dietary categories (detritivores, invertivores, omnivores,
piscivores), and three taxonomic orders (Cypriniformes, Percifromes, and Siluriformes).
re was a significant positive size-TP relationship in two of the four rivers (Sesan and
rok), in two of the three Orders (Perciformes and Siluriformes), and in two of the four guilds
civores and omnivores). I think the results are intuitive and that the manuscript is well
tten. I think the purpose of the study could be clarified in the introduction by providing the
onale for using the chosen classifications (habitat and guild). For example, I assume that the
of gape limitation is intuitively variable across the guilds, but this is not clearly presented in
text. The representativeness of the sample (143 species) of the >1000 species in the lower
kong is not mentioned. If small/large taxa or particular guilds are poorly sampled, the
ential influence of that should be mentioned in the text. The vast majority of the sampled
cies are cypriniforms and relatively few perciforms, is this consistent with the fractions of
se lineages that occur in the lower Mekong?
have clarified why we chose these habitat and trophic guilds, the potential influence of
uth gape limitation on trophic positions of the various trophic guilds, and our sample
(143 species) in relation to the total fish diversity in the Lower Mekong (LM). Also, we
e provided further explanation in relation to the sites surveys and sample
resentation (see below in point 8 [153]) and the dominance of Cypriniformes in relation
Perciformes in the LM. Please, see our responses below regarding to these points.
authors also evaluated the influence of phylogeny on the body size-trophic position
tionship using phylogenetic distance and mantel tests. This was mentioned in the Methods

e 2 (Lines 24-25): This sentence specifies that the Cypriniformes are species-rich and
logically diverse. Does this statement intend to use this to distinguish the Cypriniformes from
Siluriformes and Perciformes? This sentence should be rephrased because the Perciformes
the most speciose Order of vertebrates and arguably the most ecologically diverse. The

have revised this paragraph to clarify the gape limitation – body size relationship, but
o to indicate that mouth gape limitation is an example mentioned in the previous
tence.
s paragraph now reads:
The relationship between animal body size and trophic position has long been a
jor topic of discussion among ecologists, and a hierarchy of increasing body size with
reasing trophic level has been broadly accepted since Charles Elton’s work in the early
0s [4,10]. Trophic position might increase with body size because larger prey satisfy the
her metabolic demands of larger consumers more efficiently [11], or because consumer
uth gape constrains the upper limit of prey sizes that can be ingested [12,13], or both.
pirical studies in marine and freshwater ecosystems have supported the positive
ationships between body size and trophic position. For example, analysis of a global
aset of 8,361 fish species from 57 orders found a significant positive relationship
ween body size and trophic position [14]. Similar findings are reported by Nakazawa et
[15] who investigated relationship between body size and d 15N (an index of relative
phic position) using long-term data (40 yr) for freshwater fishes from Lake Biwa, Japan.
hough there is ample evidence of positive relationships between body size and trophic
ition of fishes, other studies have shown no relationship between trophic position and
[16,17,18] or a negative relationship [19,20], which suggests that phylogeny and
ociated morphological and behavioral constraints also influence how body size affects
cies interactions [21,20]. Thus, even though the body size–TP relationship in fishes
ears to be strongly influenced by gape limitation [22, 13], other morphological traits
ld play roles [14].
3): With the caveat that I do not have experience with applied ecology, it is not clear to me
the relationship between body size and trophic position of the fish community would inform
ource management applications. I understand the functional aspect as described in the last
agraph in the Discussion), but I can’t put together how this ultimately would influence
nagement decisions. If negative and positive relationships would result in different fishery
nagement strategies, this would be interesting and is worth clarification/explanation.
have expanded the last paragraph of the discussion to describe the importance of TP-
y size relationships to inform resource management applications.
eads:
etter understanding of the relationship between body size and trophic position in these
systems has immediate resource management applications. For instance, ontogenetic
fts toward higher trophic positions are generally assumed based on the larger absolute
of mouth gape of larger conspecifics. In some cases, trophic position declines as fishes
w (e.g. herbivorous and detritivorous fishes). When fisheries remove large herbivorous
detritivorous fishes from these food webs, diets of predatory fishes may shift and
sequently affect secondary production [18]. A strong relationship between body size and
phic position is often assumed in food web and ecosystem models of stock or biomass
amics used to inform fisheries management [e.g. [63]. Likewise, a strong relationship is
erally assumed when estimating bioaccumulation of toxins, such as heavy metals and
ticides, in fish tissues. Our findings indicate that, at least in the case of biodiverse fish
emblages of tropical rivers, this assumption does not hold, and it likely requires further
dy for verification in other systems.
0): It is not clear why gape limitation is mentioned here, especially since gape was not
asured in this study. This statement almost sounds as if gape limitation is being considered the
l expectation? I assume, that the role of gape limitation is highly dependent upon the trophic
ld classification (i.e., important among piscivores)? If this is the rationale for using the guild
sifications, that could be clarified in the text.
s is an excellent comment, and although we did not measure and analyze mouth gape,
do have general knowledge of the morphology and behavior of these fishes. Essentially,
findings counter the traditional idea that fish mouth gape determines the size of prey
sumed, thereby driving a strong positive relationship between TP and body size. This
ees with what Burress et al. (2016) found in North American cyprinids. It seems that
predators and omnivores, mouth gape limitation may contribute to the positive
ationship (findings from this study), but for detritivores and invertivores, it seems that it
s not. The null hypothesis would be no relationship between TP and body size, so we
nd support for the alternative for two guilds, and for the null in two guilds. Also, for
orders and river assemblages, the body-size-TP relationships varied, and we discussed
reasons for this variation.

Mekong do not coexist in the same habitat -- most species are restricted to particular

(219-226): Are there any ideas, maybe morphologically or physiologically, why cypriniforms
’t appear to conform to the general positive size-TP relationship?
revised this paragraph to explain some ideas about the lack of body size-TP
ationship in cypriniforms. The paragraph now reads:
e lack of relationship between body size and TP in cyprinids has been attributed to their
lutionary history [46,47,20]. German et al. [47] suggested that certain
rphological/physiological traits of cyprinids have allowed them to overcome constraints
t generally yield a positive body size–TP relationship. Cyprinids possess well-developed
ryngeal teeth used for processing food prior to digestion [46], and many have long
estive tracts that increase gut passage time to increase efficiency of plant material
estion. These two anatomical modifications appear to have played significant roles in the
lution of dietary specialization within the family [46,47]. Most of the largest cyprinids in
Lower Mekong are detritivores or omnivores that consequently have low trophic
itions, and smaller cyprinids encompass a broad range of feeding habits and trophic
itions. One can only speculate why large predatory cyprinids are not more common in
Mekong. The largest piscivorous cyprinid in our local assemblages was
crochirichthys macrochirus (mean SL 22.5 cm, mean TP 3.9); two larger piscivorous
rinids (Aaptosyax grypus maximum SL 130 cm, Luciocyprinus striolatus max. SL 200
) occur in the middle Mekong (Laos, Thailand), where they now are rare.
(264): I assume this may explain why the body sizes were significantly smaller in the Sesan?
o, please specify that here while the topic is mentioned. This paragraph (261-268), may also

chanisms without explicit consideration of alternative mechanisms and its interaction with
system properties. In this sense, an explicit consideration of alternative mechanisms to gape

acknowledge the reviewer suggestions in exploring further statistical analyses such as
ar mixed models with trophic level as the response variable, and river, habitat, and
ld as independent variables. However, given the focus of our study, we believe we used
ficient statistical analysis to test our main hypothesis. Fore example, we treated each
er and each major fish order as separate datasets to test the relationship between body
and trophic level. Rivers, orders and guilds would be expected to differ in this
ationship, and we see little advantage of citing p-values in support of what appears
ious. We are more interested in exploring this variation, and we feel that direct
parisons of patterns among rivers, orders, and guilds yield valuable insights. Also, we

agree. We have provided further explanation in the discussion of the influences of
logeny on the body size-TP relationships.
e body size-TP relationship of Lower Mekong fishes differed among the three major
onomic orders, but there also exists phylogenetic, body size and trophic variation within
h order that was not formally analyzed given the lack of a phylogeny for all taxa. Use of
onomic distance as a proxy for phylogenetic distance in the Mantel tests did not reveal a
nificant relationship with body size. Neither body size nor TP distributions differed
nificantly among the three major taxonomic orders (Supplementary material 2). For
mple, Cypriniformes in this dataset ranged in size from 3 cm (e.g. Schistura sp.) to 41
SL (Incisilabeo behri), and Siluriformes also have very small (Glyptothorax lampris, 4
) and large species (Hemibagrus wyckioides, 45 cm). The most species-rich families
hin these orders (e.g., Cyprinidae, Siluridae, Bagridae) had broadly overlapping
tributions for both body size and TP distributions (figure 4). Some closely related
cies had divergent trophic positions that might reflect adaptative divergence [58]. For
mple, Channa gachua and Ch. micropeltes, two snakeheads, had different body sizes
.6 vs. 51.8 cm SL, respectively) and trophic levels (2.7 vs. 4.1, respectively). Costa (59)
o used taxonomy as a proxy for phylogeny of marine predators, and found no effect of
logeny on the body size–TP relationship. In contrast, recent study by Naisbit et al. (21),
which taxonomy was used to represent phylogeny, found that closely related species had
ilar trophic levels. Based on analysis of molecular phylogenetic information for sharks,
zende et al. (60) found that phylogeny significantly influenced the body size–TP
ationship. Without further analysis using robust phylogenetic data, it is not possible to
ermine if phylogenetic relationships explain some of the variation in our datasets.

think the reviewer misunderstood what were trying to say here. It is not that a few
e species skewed the distributions (at least this is not apparent for cypriniforms and
riforms in figure 4), it is that we can find examples of fishes in both of these diverse
ers that are counter to the trend of larger fish having higher trophic positions.
revised this text as follows:
addition to large cypriniforms that feed at low trophic positions, the lack of correlation
ween body size and TP in the cypriniform assemblage dataset (figure 4) also is
uenced by the presence of small species with relatively high trophic positions. For
mple, small loaches (e.g. Cobitidae, Nemacheilidae) that feed on benthic invertebrates

), Interestingly, one of the largest freshwater fishes in the world, the Mekong giant
fish (Pangasianodon gigas, 3 m) is described as an omnivore [40].
