The work presents evidences for the changes that are induced by an accelerated selection process
over the dynamics in the top-list of music charts (Billboard, UK, German and Dutch). Convincing
data is given for visualizing the difference in the top-list dynamics and statistics of music charts
between 1960-90 and 1990-2018. The accelerated rhythm is nicely visible in the chart diversity
evolution. The distribution time for the time periods in which an album persist in the top 40
positions has also visible differences between these two time-periods. While in the period 1960-
1990 one observes a lognormal distribution, in the 1990-2018 period a scaling is observable
(power-law trend). The authors analyze also the differences in the evolutionary trends of an
album in the top-list. In the period 1960-90 mostly an increasing trend is dominating (albums
start at lower positions and climb towards the top....), while in the 1990-2018 period a decreasing
trend is observable (albums start right in the top and slowly descends in the list). In contrast with
albums, single songs do not have such a clear trends and statistics. The findings are explained in
the context of information-theoretical approaches using entropy maximizing principles and the
Weber-Fechner law. The manuscript is clearly presented and the topic is of broad interest. It is
definitely a work that should be published, however before publication I would suggest the
authors to take into account the following recommendations:
1. Why the authors focus only on the Western world. I assume that Asia is nowadays a leading
market. Are there long-term charts available also for Japan, South Korea, etc...? Maybe some
comments in this sense would help us.
2. The notation "log" is used for logarithm throughout the manuscript, without specifying if it is a
ten based or "e" based logarithm. In some graphs, I had the filling it is a ten based one, however
in the equations I would tend that it is an "e" based one. Please use either the accepted notations:
"lg" and "ln" or specify it.
3. The term "unique album" could be a little confusing and not necessarily pointing to what the
authors mean by that. Maybe some other expression or some explanations would be OK.
4. Equation 3.1 is incorrect. the P(S) scaling assuming the Weber-Fechner law should be
P(S)=1/S^a with a=s_0/s_bar-1.
5. In Equation 3.2 is not totally convincing for me the manner in which the coupling is taken into
account. I do understand that one needs a coupling between the "h" and "s" variables, but why in
the exponent (?) only for the sake of analytical simplicity?

I overall liked this paper and I thought the data was interesting and the modelling in section 3
was good. My two main quibbles:
1. The term "cultural time" implies to me that there is some underlying phenomenon that is
making all cultural things accelerate at about the same rate. This seems pretty unlikely to me, but
I guess you could demonstrate it by looking at data from many different cultural domains. The
paper only looks at one cultural domain. And even if many domains were considered, wouldn't it
just be straightforward to say many cultural processes are speeding up. That this is even true
seems to be belied by Figure 1 where cultural time was accelerating until 2014, and then switched
to decelerating. I know that what was measured changed in that year, but that is my point: if
there was a "cultural time" that was accelerating, it wouldn't matter what we measured, we
should still see it.
2. Given my skepticism about cultural time, I don't see what relevance the paper has to politics.
But politics appear in the first sentence of the abstract. If you want to claim that political opinions
are changing faster, then I think you really just have to look at political opinions.
So in my opinion the paper would be improved by deleting "cultural time" and downplaying
politics as a motivation.
smaller comments/questions:
page 1. in the abstract you use the phrase "unique phenomenon". How do you know this is a
unique phenomenon? Something going from a lognormal distribution to a power law
distribution has never happened before?
page 2 "a unique observation" Again, can you say a little more about this? It's never been
observed before in cultural data? Or any kind of data? What typically happens then.
page 2 sentence beginning with "It is postulated that human activities...." was hard to understand.
Maybe delete "to" after "viz".
page 4. "1990th" -> "1990s"
in lines 56 and 57 replace 1.0 with 1. (When I see 1.0 I assumed it was from data)
page 5. "The trend to become more diverse was dramatically reversed..." I don't think any real
thing reversed trend. You just switched from looking at one thing that was increasing to another
thing that was decreasing. It might be better just not to include the latter data.
page 6. "raising prominence" -> "rising prominence"
page 11. "give raise" -> "give rise"
page 13 "90th" -> "90s"

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The paper "Five decades of US, UK, German and Dutch music charts show that cultural time is
accelerating" provides an analysis of the song dynamics on top charts. Several interesting trends
are found, including an accelerated turnover of songs on charts, the increased likelihood of songs
entering as #1, and a change in the songs' lifetime distribution. I think this is an interesting study,
but I find some of the interpretations made by the authors problematic. Also, below I give
comments on how the analysis and presentation can be made clearer.
The main claim of the authors is that the observed statistical results that they obtain inform us
about the changes in cultural time. Perhaps the authors should explain exactly what this means.
The changes they observe are intuitively explained by the advent of the internet and information
accessibility. Is this what they mean by cultural time? It is clear that information has become
much more accessible across all cultural domains, and a detailed chart study is not necessary to
claim this. Therefore, I would not try to interpret the findings in the general ``cultural time"
framework, but rather concentrate on the identifying the role of the technology on chart behavior
and music consumption. I would not interpret the results as significant for democracy, politics,
and other unrelated things. It is far fetched and distracts the reader from the interesting results of
the paper.
Further, I think a more in-depth study of the chart rules should be presented. There have been a
lot of changes in the ways the charts were formed, especially in the 90s and 2000s. These changes
will obviously affect the observables such as longs lifespan, entry ranks, etc. This information
should be presented and used to explain the data.
Below are detailed comments.
Abstract: The abstract starts with statements about electoral cycles and modern democracies, but
this seems somewhat removed from the main topic of the research. I suggest removing any
mention of politics and motivate the research in a more direct way, by talking about the time
scales if music preference changes.
Page 3 line 20 - 25: connecting some results from dynamics systems with political instabilities is
very far fetched. It is not clear why these particular results should be applicable. At this point in
the paper we don't know what the observations are exactly, and further it is unclear why an
instability in a dynamics system has any relevance for "democracy in crisis". I suggest to either
explain exactly how your results are connected with political instabilities (not in the intro, but in
the discussion, after we know what the results are), or remove this part completely.

Page 3 lines 42-44: "We believe that these empirical findings constitute quantitative evidence that
the time scales determining cultural penetration and opinion formation processes have shortened
substantially, in particular since the early 90th." What is cultural penetration? Also, how do we
know that the observations are caused by the shortening of the opinion formation, and not by any
number of other reasons, much more mundane (e.g. the way the charts are created, the way
music is consumed these days compared to the past, etc)?
Page 3, line 48: what does "a unique observation" refer to?
Page 3, line 54: what are "sensori stimuli" (a typo?) In general, this whole paragraph is not clear. It
explains results that have not been presented yet, and it does so in a way that is not accessible to
people not working directly in this type of problems. I suggest to move this to the discussion and
provide more in-depth explanations.
Page 4, sales vs airplay, e.g. line 48: ``In this study we concentrate mostly on sales, viz album
charts." It appears that US top 100 charts contain information on both sales and airplay; please
clarify.
Page 6, line 34: ``Note in this respect, that there are different routes on how to include streaming
and song downloads" -- please clarify what this means.
Page 6, line 56: please remove "astonishing", and use a more quantitative description of the
goodness of fit.
Page 7, line 55: ``has been normalized such that the climbing time for albums entering at the top
is zero" -- please explain this normalization procedure.
Page 8, figure 5: It could be informative in addition to show the probability distribution (a
histogram) of the initial rank of songs that ended up as #1, for example, for 1985 and for 2015.
Pages 7-8: Number one entries. From Wikipedia: ``During the 1990s, <...> accusations began to fly
of chart manipulation as labels would hold off on releasing a single until airplay was at its
absolute peak, thus prompting a top ten or, in some cases, a number one debut. In many cases, a
label would delete a single from its catalog after only one week, thus allowing the song to enter
the Hot 100, make a high debut and then slowly decline in position as the one-time production of
the retail single sold out." -- can this have something to do with an increased tendency to debut at
number one position?
Page 8: Exit ranks. There is a rule (in Billboards charts) that albums cannot remain on the charts
for more than 20 weeks (they are taken off the charts). This will influence the exit ranks.
Page 11 figure 8: Even though the fits are not as good as in figure 3, the tendency is very similar:
the lines straighten out from being parabola-like. Should one interpret the worse fit as a
qualitative, fundamental difference, or a quantitative one?
Page 12-13, sections (b) and (c) : what is the meaning of the hidden variable, h, in the context of
music charts? In (c) it is stated that this is individual time horizons, but it is not very clear what
this means. Please clarify this connection, otherwise the derivation in (b) does not apply.
Page 15, section 4, last paragraph: again, I think the relevance of this study to politics is not clear.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
It is perplexing that the authors have submitted to Royal Society Open Science a manuscript that
is evidently in the cultural evolution space. This is not a comment on the paper's quality (indeed,
the reviewers have provided extensive queries on this front), but rather a comment on whether
the authors have selected the correct journal for their work. If the authors are able to satisfy the
reviewers that their required changes have been made, we will certainly consider the paper for
publication, but the authors might consider a more field-specific journal for other papers in this
realm.

The paper "Five decades of US, UK, German and Dutch music charts show that cultural time is
accelerating" provides an analysis of the song dynamics on top charts. Several interesting trends
are found, including an accelerated turnover of songs on charts, the increased likelihood of songs
entering as #1, and a change in the songs' lifetime distribution. I think this is an interesting study,
but I find some of the interpretations made by the authors problematic. Also, below I give
comments on how the analysis and presentation can be made clearer.
The main claim of the authors is that the observed statistical results that they obtain inform us
about the changes in cultural time. Perhaps the authors should explain exactly what this means.
The changes they observe are intuitively explained by the advent of the internet and information
accessibility. Is this what they mean by cultural time? It is clear that information has become
much more accessible across all cultural domains, and a detailed chart study is not necessary to
claim this. Therefore, I would not try to interpret the findings in the general ``cultural time"

and music consumption. I would not interpret the results as significant for democracy, politics,
and other unrelated things. It is far fetched and distracts the reader from the interesting results of

Further, I think a more in-depth study of the chart rules should be presented. There have been a
lot of changes in the ways the charts were formed, especially in the 90s and 2000s. These changes
will obviously affect the observables such as longs lifespan, entry ranks, etc. This information
should be presented and used to explain the data.

I am satisfied with most of the answers provided in the new version of the manuscript, however
the authors should still consider the following comments:
1. In the second half of one version of the manuscript references are not appearing in the PDF

2. Concerning the problem with P(S) my point is:
P(S,S+dS)=P(s,s+ds) --> P(S)dS=p(s)ds
so: p(S)=p(s) (ds/dS) => P(S)=1/S^a with a=s_0/s_bar+1.
this should be corrected in equation (3.1)

Thanks very much for revising the paper in line with my comments. I think it makes some very
valuable contributions, and I was glad I had the opportunity to review it.
Here are just some minor corrections.
(I still find the first paragraph of the abstract insufficiently motivated. But we can agree to
disagree.)
page 3, line 11 "they allow US to study..."
line 20, "SUCH as the overall..."
line 23, "by a factor OF two or more"
page 5, line 57. I think they misunderstood my comment here. I meant replace "1.0" with "1", not
with "1.". The "1." still makes me think it's data.
page 6, line 32, missing period before "For"
line 35 "as detailed in the Appendix" remove "out"
page 7, line 50, I would prefer "reversal" to "reversion"
page 14, line 55, democracies become inevitabLY unstable"
page 15, line 32, need to delete extra period between "information" and "increasingly"
lines 29 to 33. You lost me here. I thought according to your theory the power law was because of
people basically being able to buy an album they want instantly. One time scale is taken out of
the problem. So I guess "individuality" has been lost, in that there are now not different lengths of
time for people to buy albums. And I didn't think that had anything to do with "personal
preferences for musical variety". I think "growing irrelevance of individuality" begs for a
romantic misinterpretation.
line 36. "information travels nowadays substantially faster". Of course, as you know, this is not
literally true. Nothing travels faster than a radio wave. Can you say something more accurate at
the risk of being less poetic?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_6
The authors have made some changes in the manuscript, but I was somewhat disappointed that
some of my central comments were brushed off. In particular, the authors still start their abstract
by talking about democracies and elections. This has nothing to do with the work they have
performed (unless they somehow demonstrate clearly that there is a connection). A careful
analysis of chart behavior is what this paper presents, and this should not be over-interpreted as
something significant for politics. Perhaps some connections could be drawn in the discussion
section, but one cannot put this in the abstract. It is misleading.
With regards to political instabilities, the authors replied to my previous comment: "A reference
is given, [37], where the theory is developed and everything is explained exactly. It is actually a
very robust relation, time delay systems become necessarily unstable when the time delay (which
is of the order of the electoral cycle) becomes larger than the instantaneous driving, opinion
dynamics."
If the authors insist on making this connection, they should present the mathematical argument.
What in their own work represents electoral cycles? What is the time delay? What are the
equations? As the authors will agree with me, a mathematical statement that is true for one
system of equations will not necessarily hold for another system of equations. So, when they say
that everything is explained "exactly" in ref [37], it is necessary to explain how this is relevant to
the current study, which does not discuss any dynamical system explicitly.

I am satisfied with most of the answers provided in the new version of the manuscript, however
the authors should still consider the following comments:
1.In the second half of one version of the manuscript references are not appearing in the PDF
version, please double-check again what happened...And why there are two PDF-s of the
manuscript in the submission?
2. Concerning the problem with P(S) my point is:
P(S,S+dS)=P(s,s+ds) --> P(S)dS=p(s)ds
so: p(S)=p(s) (ds/dS) => P(S)=1/S^a with a=s_0/s_bar+1.

this should be corrected in equation (3.1)
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
Thanks very much for revising the paper in line with my comments. I think it makes some very
valuable contributions, and I was glad I had the opportunity to review it.
Here are just some minor corrections.
(I still find the first paragraph of the abstract insufficiently motivated. But we can agree to
disagree.)
page 3, line 11 "they allow US to study..."
line 20, "SUCH as the overall..."
line 23, "by a factor OF two or more"
page 5, line 57. I think they misunderstood my comment here. I meant replace "1.0" with "1", not
with "1.". The "1." still makes me think it's data.
page 6, line 32, missing period before "For"
line 35 "as detailed in the Appendix" remove "out"
page 7, line 50, I would prefer "reversal" to "reversion"
page 14, line 55, democracies become inevitabLY unstable"
page 15, line 32, need to delete extra period between "information" and "increasingly"
lines 29 to 33. You lost me here. I thought according to your theory the power law was because of
people basically being able to buy an album they want instantly. One time scale is taken out of
the problem. So I guess "individuality" has been lost, in that there are now not different lengths of
time for people to buy albums. And I didn't think that had anything to do with "personal
preferences for musical variety". I think "growing irrelevance of individuality" begs for a
romantic misinterpretation.
line 36. "information travels nowadays substantially faster". Of course, as you know, this is not
literally true. Nothing travels faster than a radio wave. Can you say something more accurate at
the risk of being less poetic?
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have made some changes in the manuscript, but I was somewhat disappointed that
some of my central comments were brushed off. In particular, the authors still start their abstract
by talking about democracies and elections. This has nothing to do with the work they have
performed (unless they somehow demonstrate clearly that there is a connection). A careful
analysis of chart behavior is what this paper presents, and this should not be over-interpreted as
something significant for politics. Perhaps some connections could be drawn in the discussion
section, but one cannot put this in the abstract. It is misleading.
With regards to political instabilities, the authors replied to my previous comment: "A reference
is given, [37], where the theory is developed and everything is explained exactly. It is actually a
very robust relation, time delay systems become necessarily unstable when the time delay (which
is of the order of the electoral cycle) becomes larger than the instantaneous driving, opinion
dynamics."
If the authors insist on making this connection, they should present the mathematical argument.
What in their own work represents electoral cycles? What is the time delay? What are the
equations? As the authors will agree with me, a mathematical statement that is true for one
16
system of equations will not necessarily hold for another system of equations. So, when they say
that everything is explained "exactly" in ref [37], it is necessary to explain how this is relevant to
the current study, which does not discuss any dynamical system explicitly.

is perplexing that the authors have submitted to

the cultural evolution space. This is not a comment on
e paper's quality (indeed, the reviewers have provided
tensive queries on this front), but rather a comment on
hether the authors have selected the correct journal for
eir work. If the authors are able to satisfy the reviewers
at their required changes have been made, we will certainly
nsider the paper for publication, but the authors might consider
more field-specific journal for other papers in this realm.
appreciate the concern. However several in-depth studies

sitions has also visible differences between these two time-periods.
hile in the period 1960-1990 one observes a lognormal distribution, in
e 1990-2018 period a scaling is observable (power-law trend). The
thors analyze also the differences in the evolutionary trends of

minating (albums start at lower positions and climb towards the top....),
hile in the 1990-2018 period a decreasing trend is observable (albums start
ght in the top and slowly descends in the list). In contrast with albums,
ngle songs do not have such a clear trends and statistics. The findings are
plained in the context of information-theoretical approaches using entropy
aximizing principles and the Weber-Fechner law. The manuscript is clearly
esented and the topic is of broad interest. It is definitely a work that
ould be published, however before publication I would suggest the authors
take into account the following recommendations:
thank the reviewer for his/her supporting comments.
realized in the meantime, that the original Billboard
s charts have been retained after the 2014/15 update,
it under a new name: Top Album Sales. We explain this now
he paragraph above section 2.(a). We updated all figures,
g now the Billboard sales charts as our data source.
ig. 1/3 results from both ranking metrics are shown, from
official Top 200 and from the Top Album Sales.
also added a new table, Table 1.
Why the authors focus only
the Western world. I assume that Asia is nowadays a leading market. Are
ere long-term charts available also for Japan, South Korea, etc...? Maybe
me comments in this sense would help us.
s is correct. There are, however, very practical obstacles to
native speakers when it comes to downloading Asian data, such
eing able to read Kanji. We hope that our manuscript will motivate
sequent studies.
The notation "log" is used for logarithm throughout the manuscript,
ithout specifying if it is a ten based or "e" based logarithm. In some
aphs, I had the feeling it is a ten based one, however in the equations
would tend that it is an "e" based one. Please use either the accepted
tations: "lg" and "ln" or specify it.
ll formulas we have substituted \log by \ln. In the Figures
_10 has bee used, as indicated now in the respective captions.
The term "unique album" could be a little confusing and not necessarily
inting to what the authors mean by that. Maybe some other expression or
me explanations would be OK.
number of 'unique albums' listed in a year is
number of 'distinct albums'. We have changed the wording correspondingly.
Equation 3.1 is incorrect. the P(S) scaling assuming the Weber-Fechner law
ould be P(S)=1/S^a with a=s_0/s_bar-1.
actually cannot see why. To us 3.1 seems to be
ectly fine. Maybe a \log_10 versus \ln issue?
did not include the normalization factor, if this is the issue.
In Equation 3.2 is not totally convincing for me the manner in which the
upling is taken into account. I do understand that one needs a coupling
tween the "h" and "s" variables, but why in the exponent (?) only for the
ke of analytic simplicity?
added to the section, 3.(b), a short explanation of how
imum entropy distributions are derived, see the new Eq.(3.2).
ould be now evident that the coupling a+\kappa h used
ew 3.3 (old 3.2) represents that album lifetimes are
arying importance to people. We hope that this
ifies the issue.

omments to the Author(s)
overall liked this paper and I thought the data was interesting and the
odeling in section 3 was good. My two main quibbles:
thank the referee for his/her thoughts and comments.
note that we added a new table, Table 1.
The term "cultural time" implies to me that there is some underlying
enomenon that is making all cultural things accelerate at about the same
te. This seems pretty unlikely to me, but I guess you could demonstrate it
looking at data from many different cultural domains. The paper only looks
one cultural domain. And even if many domains were considered, wouldn't it
st be straightforward to say many cultural processes are speeding up. That
is is even true seems to be belied by Figure 1 where cultural time was
celerating until 2014, and then switched to decelerating. I know that what
as measured changed in that year, but that is my point: if there was a
ultural time" that was accelerating, it wouldn't matter what we measured,
e should still see it.
custom to use the terms cultural and political time in the
ature examining the phenomenon of social acceleration. The
ree is however correct that this would imply, strictly
aking, that a single time scale exists. This is of course
the case and has never been intended.
rder to clarify the terminology the term 'cultural processes'
ow used in conjunction with 'distinct' cultural time scales.
also changed the introduction at several places in order
ake clear, that only a ''set of culturally and
ologically relevant time scales'' contribute to
rt dynamics.
would also like to point out that a previous study, [1],
used music charts (together with text-mining tools)
xamine how musical styles have been changing. The author
ented their analysis on the backdrop of cultural
nge in general, arguing that "Like any cultural
act, ..., music is the result of a
ational-selection process"
Given my skepticism about cultural time, I don't see what relevance the
per has to politics. But politics appear in the first sentence of the
stract. If you want to claim that political opinions are changing faster,
en I think you really just have to look at political opinions. So in my
inion the paper would be improved by deleting "cultural time" and
wnplaying politics as a motivation.
of course correct, that the cultural time scales may be
rly independent of political time scales, at least as a
ter of principles. For this to be true, political opinion
mation and cultural processes would however need to be
% decoupled, which seems to be unlikely.
dies would suggest otherwise, namely that "cultural and
tical processes condition each other", for which
rences have been added in what is now the 'Discussion'
ion.
ny case, following the suggestion of the referee we
e rewritten the conclusion, downplaying politics as
otivation. We also tuned down its importance in the
oduction, taking out the paragraph explaining the
to dynamical instabilities. We transferred this
graph into a new 'Discussion' section (before the
clusions).
maller comments/questions:
ge 1. in the abstract you use the phrase "unique phenomenon". How do you
ow this is a unique phenomenon? Something going from a lognormal
stribution to a power law distribution has never happened before?
, we have never seen that before. We have written an authoritative
ew on "Power laws and self-organized criticality in theory and
re", which is cited [16], but never encountered such a phenomenon.

ry, it is really very interesting.

age 5. "The trend to become more diverse was dramatically reversed..." I
on't think any real thing reversed trend. You just switched from looking
t one thing that was increasing to another thing that was decreasing. It
ight be better just not to include the latter data.

he paper "Five decades of US, UK, German and Dutch music charts show that
ltural time is accelerating" provides an analysis of the song dynamics on
p charts. Several interesting trends are found, including an accelerated
rnover of songs on charts, the increased likelihood of songs entering as
, and a change in the songs' lifetime distribution. I think this is an
teresting study, but I find some of the interpretations made by the authors
oblematic. Also, below I give comments on how the analysis and presentation
n be made clearer.
thank the referee for carefully reading and interesting comments.

ig. 1/3 results from both ranking metrics are shown, from

he main claim of the authors is that the observed statistical results that
ey obtain inform us about the changes in cultural time. Perhaps the authors
ould explain exactly what this means. The changes they observe are
tuitively explained by the advent of the internet and information
cessibility. Is this what they mean by cultural time? It is clear that
formation has become much more accessible across all cultural domains, and
detailed chart study is not necessary to claim this. Therefore, I would not
y to interpret the findings in the general ``cultural time" framework, but
ther concentrate on the identifying the role of the technology on chart
havior and music consumption. I would not interpret the results as
gnificant for democracy, politics, and other unrelated things. It is far
tched and distracts the reader from the interesting results of the paper.
agree that the term 'cultural time' is not specific enough,
ay have caused misunderstandings. We changed it in the
, and throughout the paper, to 'time scale' and/or
tural process'. We believe that this term does not need further
lanation. In our view it seems evident that the buildup of
erences for a given song is a cultural process, at least
art. This does not exclude sociological and economical
ponents.
took care to clearly state that our interpretations
interpretations and not conclusions. We went another
e through the manuscript to make sure that our arguments
re formulated carefully, correcting several instances.
ortantly, we have rewritten the conclusion. The link
pinion dynamics is now substantially less prominent.
owing the suggestion of the referee, we transferred
part of the introduction explaining the link to
amical instabilities to a new 'Discussion' section
ht before the conclusions).
referee is of course correct that 'it is clear that
rmation has become much more accessible across all
ural domains'. Studies showing quantitatively that
ural processes are accelerating are however rare,
y motivation for the present investigation.
urther, I think a more in-depth study of the chart rules should be
esented. There have been a lot of changes in the ways the charts were
rmed, especially in the 90s and 2000s. These changes will obviously
fect the observables such as longs lifespan, entry ranks, etc. This
formation should be presented and used to explain the data.
ompendium has been added in the appendix.
elow are detailed comments.
bstract:
he abstract starts with statements about electoral cycles and modern
mocracies, but this seems somewhat removed from the main topic of the
search. I suggest removing any mention of politics and motivate the
search in a more direct way, by talking about the time scales if
usic preference changes.
s is a thoughtful comment. We believe however that it is important to
nt out that charts provide a rare instance of long-term consistently
piled data. Even though details changed, the fundamental criterion,
cess, stayed the same. Such kind of data will necessarily reverberate
effects of societal process at large. In effect we believe that it
view of perspective which starting point to select.
age 3 line 20 - 25:
nnecting some results from dynamics systems with political instabilities
very far fetched. It is not clear why these particular results should
applicable. At this point in the paper we don't know what the
servations are exactly, and further it is unclear why an instability in
dynamics system has any relevance for "democracy in crisis". I suggest
either explain exactly how your results are connected with political
stabilities (not in the intro, but in the discussion, after we know what
e results are), or remove this part completely.
eference is given, [37], where the theory is developed and everything
xplained exactly. It is actually a very robust relation, time delay
ems become necessarily unstable when the time delay (which is of
order of the electoral cycle) becomes larger than the instantaneous
ing, opinion dynamics. We are sorry to disagree on this point. We
ected a typo in the section mentioned by the referee, which may
e caused a misunderstanding.
age 3 lines 42-44:
We believe that these empirical findings constitute quantitative evidence
at the time scales determining cultural penetration and opinion formation
ocesses have shortened substantially, in particular since the early 90s."
hat is cultural penetration? Also, how do we know that the observations are
used by the shortening of the opinion formation, and not by any number of
her reasons, much more mundane (e.g. the way the charts are created, the
ay music is consumed these days compared to the past, etc)?

During the 1990s, <...> accusations began to fly of chart manipulation
labels would hold off on releasing a single until airplay was at its
solute peak, thus prompting a top ten or, in some cases, a number one
but. In many cases, a label would delete a single from its catalog
ter only one week, thus allowing the song to enter the Hot 100, make
high debut and then slowly decline in position as the one-time production

creased tendency to debut at number one position?
nks for the comment.
s applies, if the `accusations' are true, to the Billboard Hot
Single charts. We tried to find reliable sources for these
usations', but could not find any. For the album charts no
od of increase #1 entries can be found, it is a continuous
sition. We do not find indications that these manipulation,
ey existed, have had a lasting effect.
age 8: Exit ranks.
here is a rule (in Billboards charts) that albums cannot remain

arts). This will influence the exit ranks.
