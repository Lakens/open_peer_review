This paper studied the supercapacitor performance using CoS as electrode material. Three
solvents were used to prepare the electrode materials, and three CoS materials were carefully
compared in the paper. The result demonstrates clearly the importance of the choice of the
solvent to the supercapacitor performance. The paper is recommended to be published with
major revision after the questions listed below being addressed:
1. On Figure 5, all current density should use the unit of ‘mA/g’ instead of ‘mA’. Please
normalize the current by the mass of electrode active materials.
2. Although the discharge curve is more important on GCD curve, the charging curve must
also be reported. The authors should report the data from 0-10s on Figure 6.
3. In order to get published, the authors should plot all figures into a same format,
Especially, Figure 2. it is distorted and unable to read the x,y label values!

4. It can be understood that using high current density to test the cycling stability will save
experimental time. But 100A/g is really far beyond the testing region. Comparing the capacitance
of current density 1.5 and 9 A/g, the degradation of capacitance is already obvious. The referee
suggest the authors test the cycling stability under the current density of 10 A/g. It will not take a
very long time for supercapacitor, but it will make your cycling stability result more reasonable.
5. The referee also suggests the authors be more careful when using the ‘high performance’
to describe their supercapacitor. It is correct that the capacitance using ethanol solvent is higher
than other two solvents, but 41 F/g in aqueous system is a low performance comparing to the
majority of the reported values.

this paper the author’s prepared cobalt sulfide using chemical bath deposition method
h different solvents such as water, ethanol and water: ethanol for super capacitor
lication. It is a nice piece of work and acceptable after minor corrections.
The author’s should explain the role of solvents on the performance of the super
acitors.
We comply with the referee’s comments. We have used pure deionized water as the solvent,
ledged nanoflakes formed because of its high nucleation and fast increasing rate, implying
the electrochemical reversibility was not good if only water was solvent. From the results,
ether with the SEM images it can be concluded that with the employment of ethanol as a
vent, active material can grow more firmly on the Ni foam substrate. In other words, the
tact between the material and the substrate for the sample prepared employing ethanol is
re intimate than that of the samples prepared in water and water/ethanol. It is observed that
interlaced nanoparticles were uniformly coated over almost the entire skeleton of the Ni foam
strate. The unique feature as material grown in the presence of ethanol is that each
oparticle has its own electrical/mechanical contact with the current collector. The
centrations of Water:Ethanol, the nanoparticles were distributed and coverage was not good
low surface area, which are able slow transportation and slow accessible sites for ions. This
ulted in poor electrochemically reactivity between the electrode and electrolyte.
Abstract” is missing from the manuscript. The authors should add it.
We appreciate the referee’s comments. Thank you for the suggestions. The mentioned abstract
included in the revised manuscript as follows:
n this study, cobalt sulfide (CoS) electrodes are synthesized using various solvents such as
er, ethanol, and a combination of the two via a facile chemical bath deposition method on Ni
m. The crystalline nature, chemical states, and surface morphology of the prepared CoS
oparticles are characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
nning electron microscopy, and transition electron microscopy. The electrochemical
perties of CoS electrodes are also evaluated using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-
charge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. When utilized as an electrode for a
ercapacitor, CoS prepared with ethanol as a solvent exhibits a capacitance of 41.36 F/g at 1.5
, which is significantly better than that prepared using water and ethanol (31.66 and 18.94 F/g
.5 A/g, respectively). This superior capacitance is attributed to the ideal surface morphology
he solvent, which allows for easy diffusion of electrolyte ions into the inner region of the
ctrode. High electrical conduction enables a high rate capability. These results suggest that
S nanoparticles are highly promising for energy storage applications as well as photocatalysis,
ctrocatalysis, water splitting, and solar cells, among others. These results show that the CoS is
mising positive electrode materials for practical supercapacitor.
YWORDS: Cobalt sulfide; Supercapacitors; Energy storage devices; cyclic voltammetry;
arge-discharge.
t is better to provide electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results to analyze the
ctrode resistance.
We comply with the referee’s comments. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis
conducted in the revision time and the results are provided in the revised manuscript.
ure 7. Impedance Nyquist plots of CoS electrode with different solvents Ethanol, Water and
ter:Ethanol.
EIS measurements were further carried out to investigate the electrochemical behaviour of
ious solvents of the CoS electrode. Figure 7 shows the Nyquist plots of the various electrodes
r the frequency range of 100 mHz to 500 kHz. Figure 7 depicts that the ethanol solvent of
S electrode exhibited a small semicircle in the high frequency range and more vertical line in
low frequency range than the water and Water:Ethanol as a solvents, implying good
acitive behaviour with the ion diffusion transport and interfacial charge transfer resistance.
se results demonstrated that the combination of electron transfer and fast ion diffusion
ulted in remarkably electrochemical performance of the ethanol as a solvent of CoS electrode.

ee CoS materials were carefully compared in the paper. The result demonstrates clearly
importance of the choice of the solvent to the supercapacitor performance. The paper is
ommended to be published with major revision after the questions listed below being
ressed:
On Figure 5, all current density should use the unit of ‘mA/g’ instead of ‘mA’. Please
malize the current by the mass of electrode active materials.
We appreciate the referee’s comments. In the revised manuscript we have provided the current
sity unit as the mA/g.

lthough the discharge curve is more important on GCD curve, the charging curve must

t can be understood that using high current density to test the cycling stability will save
erimental time. But 100A/g is really far beyond the testing region. Comparing the
acitance of current density 1.5 and 9 A/g, the degradation of capacitance is already
ious. The referees suggest the authors test the cycling stability under the current density
0 A/g. It will not take a very long time for supercapacitor, but it will make your cycling
bility result more reasonable.
We appreciate the referee’s comments. In the revision time we have provided the cycling
ility of the electrode at the 6 A/g. The relevant data is shown in below:
ure 8 Cycling performance of the ethanol based CoS electrode at a high current density of 6
-1 for 2000 cycles.
The long term cycling stability of electrode is also most important for practical
ercapacitor applications. Figure 8 shows electrochemical stability of CoS electrode as a
vent of ethanol by GCD at a current density of 6 A/g for 2000 cycles. For the ethanol solvent
he CoS electrode the real capacitance is 31.2 F/g in the first cycle, and it gradually decrease
5.1 F/g after 2000 cycles, showing 19.2% loss after 2000 cycles, indicating the good cycle
perty as an good electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitor.
he referee also suggests the authors be more careful when using the ‘high performance’
describe their supercapacitor. It is correct that the capacitance using ethanol solvent is
her than other two solvents, but 41 F/g in aqueous system is a low performance
paring to the majority of the reported values.
We really appreciate your suggestion and it is not correct sentence “Influence of solvents in
preparation of cobalt sulfide for high performance supercapacitors”.
w we changed the title from “Influence of solvents in the preparation of cobalt sulfide for
h performance supercapacitors” to “Influence of solvents in the preparation of cobalt
fide for supercapacitor” in the revised manuscript.
