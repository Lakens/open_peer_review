label_comment_1
The manuscript by Günther et al. provides a detailed description of the roosting and mating
behavior of a Neotropical bat, based on a large number of observations and a very good sample
coverage. While the data collected are very valuable, there are some important issues that I
believe should be addressed before the paper is suitable for publication. First, I recommend that
the authors provide a clear explanation of how they define groups and roosts, because at the
moment they seem to be based on personal experience and subjective assignment. The use of a
Mann-Whitney-U-test is not necessarily suitable for comparisons of site fidelity since the
assumption of independence within and between groups may be violated (see below). There are
also many details presented in the results which in my opinion make it difficult to pinpoint the
most important results of the study. For example, I do not see how estimates of group and roost
fidelity are relevant to the study. Also, some of the conclusions are not necessarily supported by
the results presented.
Other comments and suggestions:
Line 84-85: Ectophylla alba should not be included in this list, since females are primarily
responsible for roost construction. Also, I do not believe there is direct evidence that male
Uroderma bilobatum and Artibeus cinereus construct tent-roosts.
Line 165: Do you mean Figure S2?
Lines 320-322: Could you provide a further explanation about how you are defining a cluster?
Basically, it would be good to have an explanation of the distance required for a cluster to be
considered distinct from another.
Lines 344-351: How do you define a group? Normally, it is defined as individuals using the same
roost at the same time. However, this is not the way you are defining it. Because your study relies
so heavily on this property of the colony, you should provide a clear explanation of why you
decided that the colony was formed by 2 groups, and not 5 as the number of roost sites defined
would suggest.
Line 351: Do you mean Fgroup?
Lines 367-394: One of the assumptions of the Mann-Whitney-U-test is that there is no relationship
between the observations in each group of the independent variable. You use this test to compare
site fidelity between males and females, yet quite likely the position of a particular individual in a
site will affect the choice of position of other individuals (males and females) in the roost. If the
latter is true, you should consider other statistical methods that do not rely on this assumption to
test these differences.
Lines 402-403: If you provide data on the relatedness between these two “territorial” males, you
should also provide relatedness data on all males in the colony. This statement is suggesting that
territoriality can be shared among highly related males, yet with missing information this is just
providing an incomplete picture of what may be happening. For example, are other father-son
pairs more or less likely to share a territory?
Lines 412-426: You are extrapolating your definition of a territorial male, which is based on
observations of behaviors performed at night, to your daytime observations of mating behavior.
For this extrapolation to be meaningful, you would need to demonstrate that this territorial
behavior extends also to the daytime (i.e. the same males would be consistently found to be
territorial at day and night), but you have not done so. Can you provide evidence of why
territoriality at night is relevant for explaining mating behavior during the day?
3
Lines 434-448: I do not see how all these details are relevant. Perhaps they can just be
summarized in a supplementary table.
Lines 484-486: I am not entirely convinced, based on your results, that the mating system can be
defined as resource-defense polygyny. First, you did not observe active defense of particular
territories; yet an argument can be made that exclusive use of a restricted area can also be
regarded as territoriality. Despite this, why would females approach a male at a specific site and
not others? What is the value of that particular resource that makes it “attractive” (i.e. increase
reproductive success) for females? I would also argue that females are “non-defendable” at night,
and that success of “territorial” males is based on female preferences. Regardless of the
mechanism, I believe you need to present different alternatives and the evidence that supports
each one, since your data may not allow you, at the moment, to draw a firm conclusion.
Line 518: I believe you are exaggerating the difference between these two mating strategies. I
would suggest deleting the word “strikingly”.
Lines 541-542: This is extremely speculative! First, it is not well known how many individuals are
necessary to maintain crypsis at a day roost; and second, why is it necessary to add more males, if
the same effect could potentially be acquired by adding more females?
Lines 551-553: I am having difficulties understanding what you mean here.
In figure S2 you label the 5 areas in the house where bats form distinct clusters as “sites”.
However, In the text you call them “roost sites”. Since you are using measures of roost and site
fidelity, it would help to make it clear what you refer to as a roost or a site, and to maintain
consistency of these terms throughout the text.
Good luck with the revision!

label_comment_2
This manuscript examines differences in the social structure of a bat species, Rynchonycteris
naso, during the day and night. This is an especially interesting species to examine for
4
differences in social structure across a 24-hour period since colonies roost at highly exposed sites
where crypsis via large group size and reduced movement is important for avoiding predation.
The authors find striking differences in the behavior of the animals between diurnal and
nocturnal sampling periods, suggesting that ecological factors related to predation have had a
strong influence on the social structure observed in this species. This work is very novel and
reflects an ecologically interesting case that can help us better understand evolutionary
transitions in social structure. The manuscript is very well written and the research is elegant
and highly sound. As a result, I have very few comments, which follow below:
Line 30: Could you give an example of such a roost type at the end of the sentence. Something
like “…, such as a…”
Line 95: Can you explain a bit what you mean by “derived” in terms of roosting types? I'm
guessing there are a certain standard set that most bats of this taxonomic group use, and these
bats are oddities compared to others in terms of the roosting sites they select.
Lines 131-135: Can you provide a figure depicting your hypothesis? I imagine that the bats are
clumped to some extent when roosting at all times, so I'm having trouble picturing how this
would be different between night and day, other than one male and a group of females at night
versus a mix of both sexes during the day.
Line 376: What site numbers are you referring to when you say “second site”?

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-160503.R1)
See Appendix B.
e would like to thank the two reviewers for their thoughtful and helpful comments. We appreciate their
etailed and constructive input and believe that these comments have substantially improved our
anuscript.
e have now fully addressed each of the reviewers’ concerns and have discussed each comment in
etail below. In line with the reviewers’ comments our responses and changes refer to the line numbers
f the previously submitted manuscript version. We highlighted our responses in italics and additionally
nderlined changes made to text.
he main changes are (for further detail see ‘responses-to-referees file’):
. Clarified definitions of ‘roost’, ‘site’, ‘group’ and ‘cluster’ in our study set up.
. Following the suggestion by reviewer 2 we added a figure (S2) of our main hypothesis regarding day
nd night differences of social dispersion in the roost to the supplementary information.
. Considering the possibility of dependence between two tested groups (males and females) regarding
heir site fidelity, we decided to follow reviewer 1 and excluded the test. This is possible without loosing
ny line of evidence, since the key point of our study is the difference in the roosting behaviour among
ales at night, rather than differences between the sexes.
. We also followed reviewer 1 by abandoning roost fidelity from our manuscript because of redundancy
ith site fidelity and a lack of necessity in our discussion.
. We further justified our interpretation of the nocturnal social dispersion and mating strategy by
dding anecdotal evidence of male territory defence actions and further clarifications (i.e. explaining and
ustifying our choice to define territoriality).
n addition, some spelling and wording errors identified by the reviewers and authors during the revision
ave now been corrected (see below in the ‘responses-to-referees file’).
