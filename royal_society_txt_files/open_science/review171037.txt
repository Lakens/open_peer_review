Major comments:
Authors investigated an interesting problem about submerged recirculating jets. However, the
current conclusion doesn't have a high academic value since it is quite trivial. I don't need to run
the experiments; I still can claim the configurations 3 and 4 will provide shorter mixing time than
configuration 1 and 2. To improve it, authors should investigate this problem by considering all
variables, such as:
a) rejection and suction are at different vertical position
b) different nozzle direction (different angels)
c) different type nozzles
d) circulation flowrate
Above variables can also be used to control the mixing time if they are important for mixing.
Authors made conclusions based on a single experiment for each condition, what are experiment
repeatabilities.

1) remove the suction from key words

Major comments:
1. Authors investigated an interesting problem about submerged recirculating jets.
However, the current conclusion doesn't have a high academic value since it is
quite trivial. I don't need to run the experiments; I still can claim the configurations
3 and 4 will provide shorter mixing time than configuration 1 and 2.
Response to reviewer’s comments: We would like to thank the reviewer for
commenting that the problem we have investigated is interesting. We also appreciate the
reviewer’s comments on the academic value of our conclusions and we would like present
our sincere explanations to address the comments. We feel that the reviewer’s comment that
one can predict that configurations 3 and 4 will lead to shorter mixing time than
configurations 1 and 2 is probably applicable for Newtonian media. For example, Orfaniotis
et al. [1] conducted several experiments in Newtonian media altering the jet location in
relation to suction location and concluded that mixing performance depends solely on jet
momentum and not on the competing flow phenomena of jet and suction. It is our sincere
view that such conclusions cannot be drawn for non-Newtonian media without carrying out
experimental work. Mixing of a mildly viscoelastic non-Newtonian liquid such as the one
used in our work using submerged jet recirculation at low Reynolds number has seldom
been studied previously. Even the mere fact that this liquid is mixing under laminar condition
used in this work is a worthwhile reporting, in our humble opinion.
Our study clearly shows that the interactions of flows due to injection and suction do impact
mixing performance. It is our view that, if these experiments were not carried out, the
literature would lead us to suggest that configurations 3 and 4 would provide longer mixing
time than configurations 1 and 2 due to larger distance between the two nozzles in 3 and 4.
But the results obtained in our work are opposite of that trend. It should also be noted that
while mixing time decreases from configuration 1 to 3 in a linear fashion, there is a negligible
difference in the mixing times of configurations 3 and 4. We would like to sincerely
emphasise that our finding that the mixing time decreases in a linear fashion with an
increase in the nozzle separation distance (<U+039B>* ) only up to a critical value and remains
constant beyond that is a crucial one and has not been reported previously.
We have not made any amendments to the manuscript in response to the above comments
of the reviewer because we feel sincerely that all the above points have been already
addressed in the manuscript adequately.

fluidic mixing in a cylindrical reactor. The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering, 74 (2),
203-212. (doi: 10.1002/cjce.5450740205)
2. To improve it, authors should investigate this problem by considering all
variables, such as:
a) rejection and suction are at different vertical position
b) different nozzle direction (different angels)
c) different type nozzles
d) circulation flowrate
Above variables can also be used to control the mixing time if they are important
for mixing.
Response to reviewer’s comments: We would like to thank the reviewer for making
the above suggestion to improve our manuscript. We certainly agree that circulation flow
rate, nozzle position, its orientation and design will have significant influences on the mixing
time and therefore on the mixing regimes. The work presented in the current manuscript
focuses on the influence of separation distance between injection and suction nozzles
located at mid-liquid height in a tank with an aspect ratio of 1:1. This work seeks to isolate
the issue of flow field interactions by simplifying the analysis with 1:1 tank geometry whilst
maintaining nozzle orientation to simplify quantitative analysis. This work is also an attempt
to analyse the interaction phenomenon so that the results can be utilised for design
purposes.
However, we have studied other nozzle configurations in our previous works. The
impact of altering the nozzle orientation has been explored by us in one of our previous
works where we found that a jet from an upward facing nozzle led to larger mixed volume
compared to the one from downward facing nozzle, when both nozzles located at the same
liquid height [2]. This was ascribed to a complimentary relationship between injection and
suction flow fields when the nozzles are facing different directions and the favourable impact
of upward facing jet on to the flexible surface of the air-liquid interface.
We have also explored the impact of varying liquid recirculation rates on mixing time
previously, where we found that, within a range of recirculation rates studied, a lower
recirculation rate results in shorter mixing time over a dimensionless timescale [3, 4].
We believe that, once the injection-suction interaction phenomena for 1:1 tank
geometry for fixed nozzles locations are analysed and understood, it will be logical to study
the other dependencies for variables such as the ones mentioned by the reviewer. We are
currently carrying out experiments varying nozzle vertical position and angles. These works
will be reported in due course.
The following sentences have been included in the manuscript at the end of the
Results & Discussion in response to the reviewer’s comments:
‘It is possible that nozzle vertical location and angle could also have considerable influence
on the interaction between the flow fields of injection and suction nozzles and therefore on
the mixing time. These dependencies will be reported in due course.’
