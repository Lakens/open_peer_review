This research deals with an important and timely question regarding sensitivity to social
influence and its determinants. Many recent experimental studies have revealed substantial and
consistent individual differences in responses to social information, but the causes of these
differences are poorly understood. I believe that this research can provide some important
insights into this issue. Early life adversity is known to have a lasting impact on various aspects
of human cognition and the authors develop quite plausible hypotheses on how this might
impact susceptibility to social information too.
The study is described in sufficient detail to replicate the procedures and analysis. These
descriptions include sufficient control conditions, and are also detailed enough to prevent
undisclosed flexibility in this process. In sum, the methodology seems sound and feasible, and
the experimental design seems to yield sufficient statistical power to address the hypotheses.
Although I am generally sympathetic to this work, I do have a number of concerns and
suggestions which I would like to see addressed.
(1) Development of the hypotheses
• The authors use a foraging model to develop their hypothesis that environmental adversity
(composed of harshness and unpredictability) will increase individuals’ reliance on social
information in judging interaction partners. ‘Unpredictability’ is measured with methods from
Mittal et al (2015), using questionnaire items about childhood concerning daily household chaos
and whether it was easy or hard to tell what parents / family were going to say or do. The
authors hypothesize that this unpredictability leads to a focus on short-term benefits, which in
turn fosters reliance on social rather than individual information. Although the pilot data is
consistent with this argument, one could also make the opposite a priori prediction: in
unpredictable environments, other people tend to be a less reliable source of information and
provide less reliable social cues, intentionally or unintentionally. In turn, this might reduce social
trust (cf Koenig and Harris 2005). As a result, people growing up in unpredictable environments
might be expected to have a reduced rather than an increased reliance on social information.
• One interesting aspect of the design is that it allows for analysing asymmetries between social
information deviating in positive vs negative ways from individual ratings. Do/did the authors
have any a priori hypotheses about how the relative impact of positive vs negative information
depends on early life adversity (see e.g. Dillon et al 2009)? I can imagine that early life adversity
could foster a particularly pronounced sensitivity for negative deviations.
(2) Experimental design
• From the descriptions it is not clear to me that information participants have about the ‘Other
participants’ that provide the social information. The extent of social influence should vary with
the number of individuals the displayed modal rating is based on, and what their identity is (e.g.
demographics, gender, age, similarity to the participants themselves, etc).
Results
• In section 2.3.1. what do the numbers after the ‘+/-‘ sign refer to? Are these standard deviations
or standard errors? I do not really see how they match with the values (error bars) displayed in
Figure 2.
• In section 2.3.2. ‘Moderate’ and ‘strong’ disagreement are modelled as two different factors,
while they might be more naturally modelled as a continuous variable. Moreover, social
influence could be measured as the distance that a participant moves in the direction of the social
information as a fraction of the point disagreement. Following on from that, I am not sure
whether one could really conclude that social influence is greater under strong disagreement. I
think that such a claim could only be supported if there was some disproportional effect of a
3
disagreement of 3 versus a disagreement of 2.
• In section 2.3.3. I would have expected some representation of the raw data: a graph plotting
the mean rating change in each of the conditions as a function of childhood environment. This
could give the reader a feel for the distributions of individuals’ mean rating adjustments, and this
would, in my opinion, be more informative than figures showing details of model comparisons.
(3) Generalizability
• For good reasons, the hypotheses are tested in a task with a strong social component. To what
extent would the results from this task be generalized to other domains? Would the authors
expect that early life adversity might lead to higher susceptibility to social influence in general
(e.g. in non-social ‘bandit’ tasks; e.g. McElreath et al 2005), or would this be largely confined to
social decision making?

REV#1 COMMENT #1: DEVELOPMENT OF THE HYPOTHESES
The authors use a foraging model to develop their hypothesis that environmental
adversity (composed of harshness and unpredictability) will increase individuals’
reliance on social information in judging interaction partners. ‘Unpredictability’ is
measured with methods from Mittal et al (2015), using questionnaire items about
childhood concerning daily household chaos and whether it was easy or hard to tell
what parents/family were going to say or do. The authors hypothesize that this
unpredictability leads to a focus on short-term benefits, which in turn fosters reliance
on social rather than individual information.
a. Although the pilot data is consistent with this argument, one could also make the
opposite a priori prediction: in unpredictable environments, other people tend to be a
less reliable source of information and provide less reliable social cues, intentionally or
unintentionally. In turn, this might reduce social trust (cf Koenig and Harris 2005). As a
result, people growing up in unpredictable environments might be expected to have a
reduced rather than an increased reliance on social information.
b. One interesting aspect of the design is that it allows for analysing asymmetries
between social information deviating in positive vs negative ways from individual
ratings. Do/did the authors have any a priori hypotheses about how the relative impact
of positive vs negative information depends on early life adversity (see e.g. Dillon et al
2009)? I can imagine that early life adversity could foster a particularly pronounced
sensitivity for negative deviations.
RESPONSE TO REV#1 COMMENT #1
a. Our prediction that harshness should lead individuals to give more weight to social
information is based on the idea that social information is cheaper than individual
exploration (Boyd and Richerson 2005, Nettle, 2018). The reviewer suggests that the
opposite prediction could be made because, in harsh environments, individuals tend to
be less cooperative (Nettle, 2010) and therefore should be trusted to a lesser extent
(Petersen 2015). We totally agree with the reviewer on this last point. However, our
task is not a cooperative task, and it does not involve social trust. In our task,
individuals are not producing information for the benefit of the participants. Peers’
behavior is simply available, and the observer may choose to copy them or not, just as
in most real-life situations. There is no cooperation between the participants and the
individuals she is observing, and thus no conflict of interest.
In other words, it is important to distinguish between a situation of epistemic trust (i.e.
believing in someone’s expertise) and a situation of social trust (i.e. believing that
someone is not going to cheat). The benefits of epistemic trust and social trust are not
the same in a harsh environment: in a harsh environment, epistemic trust should be
high because information is expensive but social trust should be low because
cooperation is limited.
b. We agree with the reviewer on that point. One could indeed make the prediction that
childhood adversity has a selective effect on the sensitivity to negative social
information, given that this information favors false-negative, i.e., decisions which are
likely to have the smallest cost in adverse environments where cooperation is low
(avoiding a potentially positive social interaction by judging a stranger as not
approachable is less costly that taking the risk of being harmed or cheated) (Haselton &
Funder, 2006; Schaller, 2008).
These two issues will be covered in the discussion section of the final article.
______________________________________
REV#1 COMMENT #2: EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
From the descriptions it is not clear to me that information participants have about the
‘Other participants’ that provide the social information. The extent of social influence
should vary with the number of is based on, and what their identity is (e.g.
demographics, gender, age, similarity to the participants themselves, etc).
RESPONSE TO REV#1 COMMENT #2
Participants only know that ‘other participants’ are other members of the MTurk
community. This design was chosen on purpose. For a matter of design simplicity and
clarity of hypotheses, we thought it was more appropriate to limit the number of
independent variables in order to focus on the relationship between environment and
susceptibility to social influence. This strategy was further motivated by the fact that,
to the best of our knowledge, the present study is the very first one to systematically
test these relations. Note however that we fully agree with the reviewer on the fact that
a number of factors characterizing peers who display the modal rating is likely to affect
participants’ performance. The potential impact of these moderators on the relation
environment/social influence will be addressed in the discussion section of the final
article.
______________________________________
REV#1 COMMENT #3: RESULTS
a. In section 2.3.1. what do the numbers after the ‘+/-‘ sign refer to? Are these
standard deviations or standard errors? I do not really see how they match with the
values (error bars) displayed in Figure 2.
b. In section 2.3.2. ‘Moderate’ and ‘strong’ disagreement are modelled as two different
factors, while they might be more naturally modelled as a continuous variable.
Moreover, social influence could be measured as the distance that a participant moves
in the direction of the social information rather than as a fraction of the point
disagreement. Following on from that, I am not sure whether one could really conclude
that social influence is greater under strong disagreement. I think that such a claim
could only be supported if there was some disproportional effect of a disagreement of 3
versus a disagreement of 2.
c. In section 2.3.3. I would have expected some representation of the raw data: a
graph plotting the mean rating change in each of the conditions as a function of
childhood environment. This could give the reader a feel for the distributions of
individuals’ mean rating adjustments, and this would, in my opinion, be more
informative than figures showing details of model comparisons.
RESPONSE TO REV#1 COMMENT #3
a. In section 2.3.1. the values appearing after the ‘±’ refers to standard deviations,
while in the graphs of Figure 2 the error bars refer to standard errors. We now replaced
the SD values reported in the 2.3.1. section by the SEM values, and referred to them
as ‘SEM’ instead of ‘±’.
b. Our apologies for the lack of clarity. First of all, we agree with the reviewer that
ideally, disagreement with the group would be better operationalized as a continuous
variable. In the present study we chose to capitalize on a well-established social
influence task, whose effects are well-documented and robust across studies. This is
the first reason why we operationalized group disagreement as a two-level factor. The
second reason is that it allowed us to limit the number of trials in the on-line task, an
important condition to minimizing noise in on-line data (in on-line experiments
participants are usually less motivated and more distracted than in a laboratory
setting).
That being said, we believe that the reviewer is right in warning us against the
interpretation we made of the effect of disagreement in the section 2.3.2. We share the
idea that moderate and strong disagreements affect rating adjustment scores, not
social influence per see. In line with her/his recommendation, we found appropriate to
replace the label ‘social influence score’ by the label ‘social alignment score’ all along
the text, which is now defined as follows in the section 2.1.3. :
“Social influence was defined as cases where participants aligned their post-test ratings
in the direction of the information provided by the group or, said differently, adjusted
their ratings in line with the group (e.g., a positive mean rating change in positive
disagreement trials and a negative mean rating change in negative disagreement
trials).”
Regarding the modelling part (section 2.2.5.), we modified the description of the social
influence parameter as follows:
“The model consists of two free parameters, fitted to each participant’s answers: 1) a
social influence parameter d corresponding to the weight attributed by the participant
to the group rating with respect to her own initial rating, and which determined the
adjustment of the post-test rating, here measured as the signed fraction of the distance
(i.e., disagreement) between the initial rating and the subsequent group rating
(positive for adjustments in line with the group’s rating, negative for adjustments away
from the group’s rating), and 2) …”
We hope this new formulation is clearer than the previous one. We bring to the
attention of the reviewer that, in line her/his comment, the social influence parameter
was fitted to all trial types, regardless of the valence and strength of the disagreement.
The imperative of building the most parsimonious model, including a single parameter
rather than several parameters to model social influence therefore, led us to consider
post-test ratings as the signed fraction of the distance between the initial rating and
the group rating, rather than as the distance in point disagreement between the initial
rating and each type of group rating.
c. In accordance with the reviewer’s suggestions, we added in the Supplementary
Information: i) a figure representing the correlations of mean rating change obtained in
each condition (disagreement trials of each type, agreement trials, no feedback trials)
with each environmental variable (childhood harshness, childhood unpredictability,
childhood adversity); ii) a figure representing the correlations of social alignment score
obtained in disagreement trials with each environmental variables; and iii) a correlation
matrix in which all r coefficients are reported.

REV#1 COMMENT #4: GENERALIZABILITY
For good reasons, the hypotheses are tested in a task with a strong social component.
To what extent would the results from this task be generalized to other domains?
Would the authors expect that early life adversity might lead to higher susceptibility to
social influence in general (e.g. in non-social ‘bandit’ tasks; e.g. McElreath et al 2005),
or would this be largely confined to social decision making?
RESPONSE TO REV#1 COMMENT #4
Our opinion is that early life adversity might indeed lead to higher susceptibility to
social influence in a variety of decision-making domains (e.g., social, perceptual,
economic, politics). As we have pointed out in our response to rev#1’s first comment,
other people’s decisions can be judged as reliable in several domains. In the present
work, social decisions about strangers were favored over other types of decisions for
two main reasons. First, they are ecologically relevant and, second, humans are highly
competent in making such judgements (Oosterhof & Todorov, 2008).

REVIEWER #2
COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR(S)
This is an interesting study examining the effects of early life adversity on the
susceptibility for social influence, which is an important and interesting topic. The study
is well-designed, pilot data are available, and analyses are sound. I have only a few
questions.
a. Is it possible to provide more details (if possible) of the biological parameters that
are correlated with early life adversity (such as cortisol levels; amylase) and whether
these parameters correlate with behavior.
b. Do the authors consider gender differences?
RESPONSE TO REV#2
a. Early life adversity causes stress, here understood as « an umbrella term, meant to
capture times when a person has been exposed to a stimulus and judged it to be a
threat he or she cannot manage » (Miller et al., 2011). Stressful events are processed
by the organism through different pathways, and produce significant changes in
behaviour. For example, it has been recently suggested that exposure to stressors in
early life (both before and after birth) generates proinflammatory tendencies,
exacerbated by poor health behaviours, driving chronic inflammation and thereby later-
life disease (Miller et al., 2011). The candidate biological mechanisms mediating
responses to stressors involve epigenetic changes (Loucks et al. 2010; Miller et al.
2009; Taylor et al. 2006), posttranslational modification and tissue remodelling
(Borghol et al. 2011; Esposito et al. 2016).
But the effects of stress can also be embedded through endocrine pathways, such as
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, whose key product is cortisol, a
hormone peaking in response to stressful experiences (Gustafsson et al. 2010). Studies
have linked early-life stress to average cortisol output, diurnal cortisol patterns, and
cortisol responses to acute stress tests (Gustafsson et al. 2010; Hajat et al. 2010;
Lupie et al. 2001; Wright & Steptoe 2005). Increased cortisol responses to early life
stressors are notably thought to be associated with social and behavioural issues later
in life (Ouellet-Morin et al. 2011).
Finally, recent works identified structural and functional alterations of the brain in
response to adverse life conditions (Ansell et al., 2014; Arnsten, 2009; Arnsten, 2015;
McEwen & Morrison, 2013; see also Brito and Noble for a review, 2014) in several
regions (amygdala, hippocampus, frontal and parietal cortices. If evidence of functional
alterations caused by early life adversity are still scarce, it is likely that structural
changes trigger cognitive changes, since the regions involved cover various functions
such as working memory, episodic memory, processing of emotions or cognitive
control.
It is therefore reasonable to target the mechanisms covering stress responsivity as
mediators through which individuals exposed to adversity early in life switch their time-
orientation towards the present (Pepper & Nettle, 2017).
This issue will be covered in the discussion section of the article.
b. We did not consider gender differences in our study because existing evidence for an
effect of gender on susceptibility to social influence are rather meager (for a list of
recent works reporting negative results, see Bond et al., 2016 ; De Witt & Bekkers,
2016 ; Panagopoulos, 2013 ; Carli, 2017 ; Weinschenk et al., 2018).
However, the reviewer is right in pointing out the fact that gender should be integrated
in our statistical models as a control factor as it is thought to affect a number of social
decisions (Buss, 2005).
In line with the reviewer’s suggestions, we now report analyses in which models
including childhood harshness, unpredictability and adversity are compared with models
in which gender and age are successively entered as the main predictor. Results
showed that models with environmental variables always perform better than age and
gender models. These results are reported in section 2.3.3. as follows:
“Note that all type 1 models including environmental variables as main predictors
performed better than similar models that included age (Adversity vs. Age: BF10 =
3.75 ± 7.28%; Unpredictability vs. Age: BF10 = 11.92 ± 3.76%; Adversity vs. Age:
BF10 = 22.5 ± 5.08%) or gender as predictors (Adversity vs. Gender: BF10 = 1.79 ±
7.12%; Unpredictability vs. Gender: BF10 = 5.69 ± 3.45%; Adversity vs. Gender:
BF10 = 10.745.51 ± 4.86%). Models’ parameters confirmed that neither age, nor
gender, had a significant effect on social alignment scores (age: ß = -0.006 ± 0.006,
t(119) = -1.04, p = .30; gender: ß = -0.18 ± 0.10, t(119) = -1.79, p = .08).”
Similar results were obtained when the social influence parameter d was taken as the
dependent variable of the models. These results are now described in section 2.3.5 as
follows:
“Again, all models including environmental variables as main predictors performed
better than similar models including age (Adversity vs. Age: BF10 = 3.75 ± 7.28%;
Unpredictability vs. Age: BF10 = 11.92 ± 3.76%; Adversity vs. Age: BF10 = 22.5 ±
5.08%) or gender (Adversity vs. Gender: BF10 = 1.79 ± 7.12%; Unpredictability vs.
Gender: BF10 = 5.69 ± 3.45%; Adversity vs. Gender: BF10 = 10.745.51 ± 4.86%).
Models’ parameters confirmed that neither age, nor gender, had a significant effect on
social alignment scores (age: ß = -0.002 ± 0.002, t(119) = -0.79, p = .42; gender: ß
= -0.08 ± 0.04, t(119) = -1.86, p = .07).”
