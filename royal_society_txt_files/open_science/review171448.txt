The present study examines a Behaviour Systems approach to earlier controversial reports of
“causal reasoning” in rats. The topic has generated interest in the field because it grapples with
the basic question of what constitutes evidence for “causal reasoning” in animal species other
than humans. Thus, the paper could be of general interest. In the present paper, the authors
creatively apply Behaviour Systems theory to the main finding in the causal reasoning
experiment, originally reported by Blaisdell, Sawa, Leising, & Waldmann (2006), that has
generated interest. In particular, Blaisdell, et al (2006) originally reported that if rats had acquired
a causal model of experimental events, whereby event A was seen as a common cause of event B
and also of Food reward, the animals might come to expect Food when event B is tested on its
own. This follows from the inference that event A must have been around at some point to
produce event B during the test session, and, if that were true, then Food is likely to follow.
However, the key manipulation was an “intervention” one in which another set of rats pressed a
response lever in order to produce event B. Under those circumstances, a causal model approach
might assume that event B was produced by the animal’s own actions and not by event A.
Therefore, the animal should not anticipate Food reward under these circumstances. Blaisdell et
al (2006) assessed this “expectation” of food reward by monitoring the animals nose-poke
responses directed to the food trough, and, indeed, they observed reduced levels of responding
3
during this intervention test compared to a control in which event B occurred on its own,
independent of the animal’s lever press response.
The present analysis departs from the causal model theory approach (as well as a rival competing
response theory) by explaining the main finding as arising from different behavioural sequences
produced in these two circumstances. Importantly, this approach anticipates that while the level
of nose-poke responding should be low during event B in the intervene condition, it should be
relatively high when looking in a short time period preceding the execution of the lever press
response. The authors report empirical data from an experiment performed with rats to confirm
this expectation, and they provide further analytical work contrasting various quantitative
models with these time-stamped data.
Overall, I very much like the ideas expressed in this report, however, I also have some fairly
substantial reservations about the contribution as a whole. These are detailed below.
1. One problem is that key aspects of the “causal reasoning” effect reported by Blaisdell et al
(2006) have not been consistently replicated in the literature. This means there is uncertainty
concerning the empirical status of the basic phenomenon. The present contribution, while
offering an interesting take on the problem does not really shed too much light on this
uncertainty.
2. A related concern I have is that Leising et al (2008, Experiment 2) reported no differences in
nose-poke response levels during the pre-stimulus period in their intervene and observe groups.
Thus, one wonders whether the present analysis even applies to those earlier results. This is not a
trivial concern because the main finding of interest here that justifies the Behaviour Systems
analysis (i.e., increased nose-poke responding in the intervene condition during the pre-stimulus
period) appears to be unnecessary to produce the effect during the stimulus presentation.
3. Another concern is that the empirical work in the present report is only from a single
experiment without any additional controls beyond the most basic one. Therefore, I am not so
sure it adds a lot beyond the interesting theoretical ideas. One would like to see, for instance, a
test of a unique hypothesis that goes beyond the basic intervene vs observe comparison to assess
the Behaviour Systems approach more fully. For instance, by focusing on the momentary
transitions between behavioural modes across the test session, the analysis would seem to
anticipate that pairing the Light with the Tone in the first phase of the experiment should be
inconsequential to obtaining the effect. However, there are clear demonstrations in the literature
that such L-T pairings are critically important. Moreover, earlier reports in the literature of no
differences in nose-poke responding when the lever response produces a “direct” cause of food
during the critical test (as opposed to the indirect one of interest here), seems to pose additional
problems with the Behaviour Systems analysis. The same applies to the “associative chain”
condition in the original report. In other words, this reader is left with the problem of wondering
whether the clever analysis offered here has any generality at all when considering the
phenomenon together with its variety of control conditions.
4. The paper is far too long and should be made much more succinct. I suspect, only the very
committed will get through this one to the end. The main empirical contribution is seen in the
pre-stimulus period, and the extensive theoretical analysis with different quantitative models
would not appear to add much beyond that basic fact.
5. The authors interpret lever press responding as consummatory and nose-poking as a focal
search response. However, consider a situation where you teach the rat to press the lever for
food reward. Under those circumstances, the rat will press the lever first and then nose-poke into
the food trough to retrieve its food. Since nose-poking is most temporally proximal to the receipt
4
of food, one could just as easily imagine that general pacing reflects general search, lever pressing
is a focal search behaviour, whilst nose-poking is consummatory. I wonder if the rat licks at the
food trough and gnaws at its opening…. In short, the justification for thinking that lever
responding is really consummatory and nose-poking is focal is lacking. This would at the very
least complicate the analysis.
All of these concerns, notwithstanding, the paper offers some interesting ideas that have the
potential to advance our understanding of “causal reasoning” in rats. However, the paucity of
data and the more general applicability of the theory to other aspects of the phenomenon reduce
the impact of the paper. If additional empirical data could be presented, especially relevant to
unique predictions of Behaviour Systems theory, that could substantially improve the report.

Associate Editor's comments:
While both reviewers are generally positive about the potential contribution of this study to the
literature, both brought up that (a) the article was very long and (b) the mathematical modelling
was of questionable additional value. Therefore, as well as answering the other specific points,
the authors should ensure a resubmission is much more concise and should make a strong
argument if they wish to keep the models.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
This revised manuscript only partially addresses my earlier concerns. The main finding is that
the two groups of a “causal reasoning” study differ in opposite ways during pre-stimulus and
stimulus periods. The large pre-stimulus difference presents problems for causal reasoning and
response competition models that fail to anticipate such a difference. However, the finding is
consistent with a Behaviour Systems approach.
While the manuscript has been reduced from 46 pages to 38+ pages of text, given the apparent
simplicity of the experiment and the main findings it is hard to justify the current length of the
manuscript. I still am of the view that there are interesting ideas expressed here, but I also think
the mathematical modeling is highly distracting and should be eliminated from the manuscript.
My more specific suggestions are as follows:
1. After describing in the Introduction the causal model theory and the response competition
9
views in qualitative terms, perhaps the same can be done for the Behaviour Systems view (e.g., as
is depicted in Figure 2). Then after about 5 pages, the Methods section can appear. The lengthy
and difficult, assumption-rich quantitative descriptions of the various models can be avoided.
The essential idea is that the Behaviour Systems approach views behavior in these situations as
an ongoing stream of transitions from one behaviour mode to another, and that justifies
providing a more fine-grained time series analysis than is typically done.
2. With this approach, the Results section can also be stream-lined. For instance, Figures 5 and 6
can be eliminated. It is sufficient to show that the data do reveal important pre-stimulus
differences. That fact alone is not anticipated by the models of interest. It does little to convince
the reader of this problem for these theories by applying some curve-fitting models to show poor
quantitative fits to the data. The reason for the poor fits is the major response differences in the
pre-stimulus period. The empirical time series data in Figures 4, 7, and 8 seem important to
emphasize what would be expected of the model shown in Figure 2. But I don’t think the data
actually need to be fit quantitatively to make the important points.
3. The alternative causal model depicted in Figure 9 seems quite odd. Since this approach is
rejected anyway, I wonder whether this is essential.
4. The “direct cause (simultaneous conditioning)” and “causal chain (sensory preconditioning)”
control procedures should be spelled out when they are first introduced. This way it would be
easier for the reader to follow the points being raised.
5. The Behaviour Systems approach seems to make a rather strange prediction, namely, that the
same results should be found in groups trained initially with L – T pairings in phase 1 as well as
one given unpaired presentations of L and T in phase 1. Since all the action depends upon the
behavioural mode the animal is in just prior to and after a lever press during the test session, then
it seems that giving L-T pairings in phase 1 should not be required. There should be some
discussion about this prediction. I earlier suggested that some empirical test of it would be ideal,
but, failing that, at the very least some concrete predictions should be offered to the reader. Also,
I wonder if there is anything in the literature that would bear on this prediction. This is a
critically important issue because if the single result described here is anomalous, for some
reason, then maybe the current framework only applies to this one circumstance.
6. Similarly, the apparent inconsistency with the earlier Leising et al (2008, Expt 2) study should
be discussed. By my reading these authors failed to find any nose-poke differences in the pre-
stimulus period between their key groups. Discussing the present results in view of earlier ones
speaks to the generalizability of the findings.
7. I didn’t find the logical arguments in the discussion section against the response competition
approach very compelling. Furthermore, the negative correlations observed by Dwyer et al
during the stimulus periods only seems sensible if there might be range restriction problems at
other times due to overall low response levels. Thus, I also didn’t find the supplemental
correlational analysis (Figure 10) very helpful.
8. Finally, the fact that self-pacing behaviors showed no between-group differences makes them
hard to interpret. The authors assume that these reflect “feeding-related” behaviors, but there is
no evidence to support this. They could merely be non-specific, randomly occurring behaviors.
In short, I remain convinced that the creative extension of Behaviour Systems theory to the
“causal reasoning” experiment is interesting and newsworthy. However, I think the authors
should still considerably streamline their paper and make it more readily digestible. Only the
most essential features of the data and ideas should be conveyed to have maximal impact. Also,
10
a better integration with the literature in terms of unique predictions by this approach would be a
welcomed addition.

7. I didn’t find the logical arguments in the discussion section against the response competition
approach very compelling. Furthermore, the negative correlations observed by Dwyer et al
during the stimulus periods only seems sensible if there might be range restriction problems at
other times due to overall low response levels. Thus, I also didn’t find the supplemental
correlational analysis (Figure 10) very helpful.
8. Finally, the fact that self-pacing behaviors showed no between-group differences makes them
hard to interpret. The authors assume that these reflect “feeding-related” behaviors, but there is
no evidence to support this. They could merely be non-specific, randomly occurring behaviors.
In short, I remain convinced that the creative extension of Behaviour Systems theory to the
“causal reasoning” experiment is interesting and newsworthy. However, I think the authors
should still considerably streamline their paper and make it more readily digestible. Only the
most essential features of the data and ideas should be conveyed to have maximal impact. Also,
a better integration with the literature in terms of unique predictions by this approach would be a
welcomed addition.

I am pleased to provide some thoughts on Causal Reasoning in Rats’ Behaviour Systems.
Bowers and Timberlake have provided a unique and very interesting approach to examining
causal reasoning abilities in rats. They have offered an alternative hypothesis to causal model
theory (CMT). According to the authors behaviour systems theory generates an alternative
hypothesis to CMT, and their data support this alternative. One of the most impressive
contributions of behaviour systems theory is its focus on fine grained detailed analyses of
behaviour within the experimental context. Furthermore, behavioral responses are recorded on a
greater than usual temporal scale, to include responses that precede, coincide, and follow
stimulus presentations. Bowers and Timberlake studied fine grained behavioural detail in their
experiment, and conclude that behaviour systems theory provides a better account of CMT in
explaining causal reasoning in rats. This is an important contribution to the animal
learning/cognition literature. I recommend publication. I have two general comments.
The introduction, and to some extent the discussion, would benefit considerably from some
trimming. I would rather the authors get to the point more quickly. Otherwise I fear this article
will only be of interest to a relatively small fraction of the readership.
At times, especially in the discussion, I felt I was reading a transcript from an argument between
the authors and Blaisdell et al. The tone that the authors take in the discussion, in terms of the
certainty by which they believe Blaisdell et al are incorrect, to be a bit strong. The behaviour
systems hypothesis may provide a better account of the data than causal model theory, but then
as is the case in science another alternative hypothesis will probably come along.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Mark Walton):
As requested, I solicited opinion from an additional independent reviewer. As you will see, they
agreed that the work was interesting and worthy of publication. However, in agreement with the
previous reviewer (and my opinion too), they also found the Introduction and Discussion to be
lengthy, dense and argumentative. I would therefore recommend one more round of revisions
with a particular eye to trimming the Introduction (which, to my estimate, is longer even than the
Discussion) such that the background, hypotheses and aims of the study are set out *succinctly*.
Moreover, the Discussion should be toned down in line with R3's comments.

e: An analysis of causal reasoning in rats’ behavior systems
current manuscript is a comprehensive research article that focuses on re-evaluating causal
oning theory based on one study that provides scientific evidence for the theory. The
arch design of the experiment includes a continuous and finer-grained measurement of a
ader range of behaviours. Overall, the outcome of the experiment indicated that altering the
cedures as such result in a richer explanation in the context of the Behaviour Systems Theory,
what would otherwise be characterized as causal reasoning in rat behavior.
manuscript is of high quality and makes a meaningful contribution to the literature. The
clusions are supported by the data and the experimental procedures and statistical analyses
methodologically and scientifically sound. Therefore, I find the paper to be acceptable for
lication with some revision. Below, I list some minor to moderate concerns/suggestions that
ht help improve the quality of the manuscript.
While I appreciate the extensive review of theories and models to assess and describe the rats
aviour, the manuscript could be much more condensed and concise. There is redundancy of
rmation at the front end and toward the middle (i.e., bottom of pg. 4 and p. 10). In addition,
ems that the theories could be introduced first and then a description of the study of interest,
owed by the experiment. The manuscript currently reads like a review article until the
entation of the experiment.
nother question is whether the mathematical models add anything to the conclusions. Their
usion does provide further support for the Behaviour Systems account in explaining the data
it is unclear whether this is compelling enough to include. Perhaps, it could be better tied in
h the outcome of the behavioural data, in a more concise fashion, it might be suitable to
ude.
er minor:
. 3, bottom paragraph, the second sentence seems to be missing something
he authors describe the outcome of nose-poking in the food hopper as a focal result but it is
lear what is meant by this and it could get confused with focal search behavior (Behaviour
tems)
Appendix B
Our replies to the reviewers' and editor’s comments are marked by * in the context of each
comment.
Associate Editor's comments:
While both reviewers are generally positive about the potential contribution of this study to the
iterature, both brought up that (a) the article was very long and (b) the mathematical modelling was
of questionable additional value. Therefore, as well as answering the other specific points, the
authors should ensure a resubmission is much more concise and should make a strong argument if
they wish to keep the models.
*a) The slightly greater than average length of the initially submitted draft was due to our attempts
to walk the reader through each perspective, and clarify the assumptions of each. In the context of
resilient confusion surrounding the Blaisdell et al. 2006 demonstration, we felt this to be important.
However, we also see the benefits of brevity. In our revision, we have managed to reduce the length
substantially by tightening the language at several points, and by cutting some repetition. The
revised manuscript is 9 pages lighter.
n addition, we took to heart Reviewer 1’s comment that the introduction appeared pedagogical. In
the initially submitted draft, we had introduced the three hypotheses in sequence first, then went
through the sequence a second round to discuss the specific predictions of each for the experiment;
we now suspect this may have made the introduction seem longer, or repetitive. In the revised
version, we have reduced the initial introduction of each hypothesis to a bare minimum. We expect
that this simple restructuring of the introduction will improve readability.
*b) We feel strongly that the modelling is essential to our analysis, and to this manuscript. Although
we see the reviewers’ point that the strongest single empirical observation we present may be the
pre-stimulus peak in responding, and that this may seem sufficient to counter the causal model and
response competition hypotheses, it is only one part of our argument that animals in the two
circumstances in focus (LD and RI) differ in specific motivational terms, which produces an
understandable difference in patterns of interrelated response forms, not just on the single
dimension that previous workers have highlighted. The modelling is the basis of our positive
argument concerning behaviour systems. The modelling shows how the theory predicts our results
n specific terms, and also makes our assumptions for all of the views transparent. Please note that
we are arguing against not only causal model and response competition interpretations, but
associative models (that have attempted to incorporate Blaisdell et al.’s results) as well. Proponents
of all these views will need to see the specific grounds on which we are finding against them.
Amid rising recognition in psychology of a general problem concerning imprecision of predictions,
we furthermore feel that the specificity provided by our use of modelling methods is an important
strength of our analysis, and one that we would especially like to reach the readers. We expect that
many readers will appreciate the specificity and depth we were able to provide, and that some may
be able to use that specificity in their own future research. The discourse surrounding the Blaisdell et
al. (2006) demonstration in particular has been disappointing from the beginning—polarising and
unproductive—largely because of imprecise and unarticulated assumptions. Our interest is not in
saying that Blaisdell et al. 2006 were wrong, but to help the community to see how to move forward.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
The present study examines a Behaviour Systems approach to earlier controversial reports of “causal
reasoning” in rats. The topic has generated interest in the field because it grapples with the basic
question of what constitutes evidence for “causal reasoning” in animal species other than
humans. Thus, the paper could be of general interest. In the present paper, the authors creatively
apply Behaviour Systems theory to the main finding in the causal reasoning experiment, originally
reported by Blaisdell, Sawa, Leising, & Waldmann (2006), that has generated interest. In particular,
Blaisdell, et al (2006) originally reported that if rats had acquired a causal model of experimental
events, whereby event A was seen as a common cause of event B and also of Food reward, the
animals might come to expect Food when event B is tested on its own. This follows from the
nference that event A must have been around at some point to produce event B during the test
session, and, if that were true, then Food is likely to follow. However, the key manipulation was an
“intervention” one in which another set of rats pressed a response lever in order to produce event
B. Under those circumstances, a causal model approach might assume that event B was produced
by the animal’s own actions and not by event A. Therefore, the animal should not anticipate Food
reward under these circumstances. Blaisdell et al (2006) assessed this “expectation” of food reward
by monitoring the animals nose-poke responses directed to the food trough, and, indeed, they
observed reduced levels of responding during this intervention test compared to a control in which
event B occurred on its own, independent of the animal’s lever press response.
The present analysis departs from the causal model theory approach (as well as a rival competing
response theory) by explaining the main finding as arising from different behavioural sequences
produced in these two circumstances. Importantly, this approach anticipates that while the level of
nose-poke responding should be low during event B in the intervene condition, it should be
relatively high when looking in a short time period preceding the execution of the lever press
response. The authors report empirical data from an experiment performed with rats to confirm
this expectation, and they provide further analytical work contrasting various quantitative models
with these time-stamped data.
Overall, I very much like the ideas expressed in this report, however, I also have some fairly
substantial reservations about the contribution as a whole. These are detailed below.
* This reviewer made many very good points. Although several of these we were only able to
concede or rebut, disagreements not withstanding, we want to acknowledge the obvious care and
perspicuity of this reviewer’s treatment of our manuscript.
1. One problem is that key aspects of the “causal reasoning” effect reported by Blaisdell et al (2006)
have not been consistently replicated in the literature. This means there is uncertainty concerning
the empirical status of the basic phenomenon. The present contribution, while offering an
nteresting take on the problem does not really shed too much light on this uncertainty.
* What we argue are the key aspects have been replicated numerous times by multiple laboratories
(Leising et al., 2008; Dwyer et al., 2009), including our own as reported in the present manuscript.
What has been less consistently replicated concerns the data of the control conditions that Blaisdell
et al. (2006) stressed, which were important for their purposes, but which we argue (at length, in a
dedicated section) are ambiguous with respect to the theories under consideration. We agree with
the reviewer that our data shed little light on that particular uncertainty, but argue that that is not
where we should be directing our attention. We also note that Dwyer et al. 2009 have sufficiently lit
that aspect or problem, and we accept their results. The fact that we drew different conclusions is
testament of the value of our taking a different approach.
n our revision, we have put this point more centrally. We feel that doing so has made our target and
strategy for addressing it clearer in the revised draft.
2. A related concern I have is that Leising et al (2008, Experiment 2) reported no differences in nose-
poke response levels during the pre-stimulus period in their intervene and observe groups. Thus,
one wonders whether the present analysis even applies to those earlier results. This is not a trivial
concern because the main finding of interest here that justifies the Behaviour Systems analysis (i.e.,
ncreased nose-poke responding in the intervene condition during the pre-stimulus period) appears
to be unnecessary to produce the effect during the stimulus presentation.
* On this point, we would direct the reviewer’s attention to the differences in the way the data were
treated in Leising et al. (2008). In particular, they counted feeder entries whereas we measured
durations. Also, they log-transformed their data, dropped the substantial proportion of subjects with
zeros, and used the resultant transformed values to calculate discrimination ratios. We have added
citation of the Leising et al. 2008 data in the relevant section of the discussion in the revised
manuscript.
3. Another concern is that the empirical work in the present report is only from a single experiment
without any additional controls beyond the most basic one. Therefore, I am not so sure it adds a lot
beyond the interesting theoretical ideas. One would like to see, for instance, a test of a unique
hypothesis that goes beyond the basic intervene vs observe comparison to assess the Behaviour
Systems approach more fully. For instance, by focusing on the momentary transitions between
behavioural modes across the test session, the analysis would seem to anticipate that pairing the
Light with the Tone in the first phase of the experiment should be inconsequential to obtaining the
effect. However, there are clear demonstrations in the literature that such L-T pairings are critically
mportant. Moreover, earlier reports in the literature of no differences in nose-poke responding
when the lever response produces a “direct” cause of food during the critical test (as opposed to the
ndirect one of interest here), seems to pose additional problems with the Behaviour Systems
analysis. The same applies to the “associative chain” condition in the original report. In other
words, this reader is left with the problem of wondering whether the clever analysis offered here
has any generality at all when considering the phenomenon together with its variety of control
conditions.
* We feel that, by providing comparison with a baseline and pre-stimulus measures, we provided
better controls than the ostensible controls of the original Blaisdell et al. (2006) study, which we
argue are dissatisfying for several reasons. We argue explicitly that the “direct” (i.e. simultaneous
conditioning) or “associative chain” (i.e. sensory preconditioning) procedures are not informative for
our account. They are well-suited for dealing with a different set of concerns (like response
competition), but Dwyer et al. 2009 have already solved that problem (as mentioned above) by
showing that analogous results obtain in those conditions as well. In short, the variety stressed by
Blaisdell et al. 2006 was insufficiently established, and then shown to be regular by Dwyer et al.
2009. We believe that we have been able to make our reasoning with respect to these earlier results
(and its orthogonality to our question) clearer in the revised draft.
Regarding adding further experiments to test the generality of our behaviour systems-based
hypothesis, we would certainly like to, but find ourselves unable due to the closing of our laboratory.
n any case, we have found that the present experiment has given us much to say.
4. The paper is far too long and should be made much more succinct. I suspect, only the very
committed will get through this one to the end. The main empirical contribution is seen in the pre-
stimulus period, and the extensive theoretical analysis with different quantitative models would not
appear to add much beyond that basic fact.
* See our reply to this concern above.
5. The authors interpret lever press responding as consummatory and nose-poking as a focal search
response. However, consider a situation where you teach the rat to press the lever for food
reward. Under those circumstances, the rat will press the lever first and then nose-poke into the
food trough to retrieve its food. Since nose-poking is most temporally proximal to the receipt of
food, one could just as easily imagine that general pacing reflects general search, lever pressing is a
focal search behaviour, whilst nose-poking is consummatory. I wonder if the rat licks at the food
trough and gnaws at its opening…. In short, the justification for thinking that lever responding is
really consummatory and nose-poking is focal is lacking. This would at the very least complicate the
analysis.
* The reviewer is stressing temporal determinants, much like is presented in several of Silva’s
papers, with whose thinking we are sympathetic. We stressed the form of behaviour, and the
functional significance of that form. A consummatory predatory response form is conceptualised as
one that serves the rat well at the moment of a kill, such as the bite and grab that characterises lever
contact. Timberlake & Washburne (1989) showed a striking correspondence between the bite and
grab of a food-predictive rolling ball bearing, and the bite and grab of a live cricket for a number of
rodent species varying in terms of reliance on predation. The lever contact is similar in form to how
rats handle the ball bearings as described in Timberlake & Washburne (1989) and in other studies.
Focal search is conceptualised as an intermediate response form by which the animal is brought into
close proximity with an identified food source. Having a single food source in our apparatus permits
us to accentuate this manifestation of focal search.
The reviewer’s hypothesis that checking a feeder can be trained to take a consummatory role is an
nteresting one, but it should not be considered uncontroversial. The ease with which a rat can be
trained to press a lever before nosing a feeder is not only consistent with viewing the lever contact
as consummatory and the feeder checking as focal search, but predicts it, especially by the specific
view we are stressing, as presented in Silva et al. (1998). While we agree with the reviewer that the
question warrants its own direct treatment as interesting specifically to behaviour systems
researchers, we feel that is a separate study. Future research might, for instance, ask whether a
ever-feeder-lever sequence is more frequent than feeder-lever-feeder. However, in the present
study, presentations are contingent on lever contact for one group, and so our experiment does not
permit the kind of comparison that would be necessary to address the question empirically.
Some authors have talked about “consuming” in place of consummatory. This may be just as
accurate in many feeding circumstances, but it permits readers to confuse two notions that overlap
only superficially. If one thinks of this category of behaviour as ‘consuming’, nosing the feeder might
seem closer than grabbing the lever. However, consuming and consummatory are not to be
conflated. We have made this point elsewhere, but we have added such a note to the present
manuscript (p.13) in recognition that the word ‘consummation’ is uncommon, not in everyone’s
vocabulary, and has shown itself to be easy to confuse with the unrelated word ‘consumption’.
Also, it is important to note that what counts as a consummatory or focal search behaviour depends
on the apparatus and procedure. There is no claim that these behavioural forms are strictly pre-
specified. For instance, a pigeon’s key peck will be different if the key is on a wall versus a floor, and
may be expression of different motivational states even though they are both pecks. There are
eating pecks, drinking pecks, filial pecks, sexual pecks, and aggressive pecks, and perhaps even
operant pecks (Skinner, 1980). We have made note of this in the revised manuscript (p. 13).
What we can show is that lever contact occurs in quicker bouts than feeder checking. This bears on
the question because consummation is conceptualised as occurring in shorter bouts than focal
search (as visible in Figure 2 in the manuscript). This can be quantified with autocorrelations over a
range of time scales, with attention paid to the scale at which autocorrelations approach zero. This
should happen at some scale for any behaviour. For instance, in 2-second bins talking on the
telephone is strongly self-predictive, but this will lessen with larger time scales. My talking on the
telephone during the period 10-11am is barely predictive of my doing the same 11am-noon. There
may be other patterns at longer time scales (e.g. more telephone use in winter than summer), but
anything that occurs in a spurt will be high at short time scales, and drop before it does anything
else. Quantifying the initial decline to baseline gives a measure of the relevant time course. The
following excerpt from my thesis expresses the point in the context of the present data:
Positive autocorrelations (delay of one unit of time) for all three behaviours are significant ... at
shorter time scales, becoming uncorrelated at longer scales. Thus, all three behaviours occur in
spurts, but these spurts follow different time courses. Lever contact is the quickest, with significant
correlations only up to adjacent 50 or 60-second periods [NB. There were two criteria]. Nosing the
food trough persists longer, self-predictive in up to 2-minute periods, and the longest time course is
seen in presence on the far platforms, with significant autocorrelations among adjacent periods of
up to 4 minutes. The relative difference in time course of the three behaviours fits predictions of BST
[behaviour systems theory], by which consummatory, focal search, and general search behaviours
are, respectively, short, intermediate, and longer-termed response forms.
We have added a concise note to the revised manuscript making this point (p. 25).
More strongly than this, however, we feel that the conceptual argument is compelling, well founded
on prior research, and easy to communicate to a broad audience. We furthermore note that our
study adds its own “proof in the pudding” support.
All of these concerns, notwithstanding, the paper offers some interesting ideas that have the
potential to advance our understanding of “causal reasoning” in rats. However, the paucity of data
and the more general applicability of the theory to other aspects of the phenomenon reduce the
mpact of the paper. If additional empirical data could be presented, especially relevant to unique
predictions of Behaviour Systems theory, that could substantially improve the report.

1) While I appreciate the extensive review of theories and models to assess and describe the rats
behaviour, the manuscript could be much more condensed and concise. There is redundancy of
information at the front end and toward the middle (i.e., bottom of pg. 4 and p. 10). In addition, it
seems that the theories could be introduced first and then a description of the study of interest,
followed by the experiment. The manuscript currently reads like a review article until the
presentation of the experiment.
* Please see our reply to this point above.
2) Another question is whether the mathematical models add anything to the conclusions. Their
inclusion does provide further support for the Behaviour Systems account in explaining the data but
it is unclear whether this is compelling enough to include. Perhaps, it could be better tied in with the
outcome of the behavioural data, in a more concise fashion, it might be suitable to include.
* Please see our reply to this point above.
Other minor:
3) p. 3, bottom paragraph, the second sentence seems to be missing something
* We did not see anything missing in that or nearby sentences.
4) The authors describe the outcome of nose-poking in the food hopper as a focal result but it is
unclear what is meant by this and it could get confused with focal search behavior (Behaviour
Systems)
* We see the reviewers point. We were using ‘focal’ in two contexts within the manuscript. We have
replaced instances of the non-technical usage with a synonym (or sometimes ‘in focus’).

Comments to the Author(s)
This revised manuscript only partially addresses my earlier concerns. The main finding is that the
two groups of a “causal reasoning” study differ in opposite ways during pre-stimulus and stimulus
periods. The large pre-stimulus difference presents problems for causal reasoning and response
competition models that fail to anticipate such a difference. However, the finding is consistent with
a Behaviour Systems approach.
* We feel we should clarify one point in the reviewer’s summary. It is not accurate to say that we
have presented our data as problematic for causal reasoning models in general. Although others
have presented ‘causal reasoning’ as a capacity, and its presence or absence as a hypothesis itself,
such approaches have not proven to be very productive. This is not how we think, and not what we
have written. Rather, we approach theories of causal reasoning as a perspective, a way of
understanding the rat’s internal processes, which furthermore provides theoretical tools for analysis
n such terms. We are trying to move the study of causal reasoning forward by finding how terms of
this perspective can inform analyses in terms of a behaviour systems perspective. We have stressed
that these two perspectives are complementary, in principle, and that an integrative approach which
acknowledges the growing breadth and maturity of contemporary theories of causal reasoning
carries more promise than ‘us versus them’ thinking, even though the latter has been more
prevalent. We have laboured to make this clear, as well as which specific views are discouraged by
our data, and have stressed that this is only a subset of views of causal reasoning. In particular, we
find against CMT (Causal Model Theory), which is a specific theory, the set of views at the centre of
the storm that followed the Blaisdell et al. 2006 demonstration. There is a movement in psychology
now in which scientists are setting aside simplistic and divisive approaches that place whole
perspectives and scientific communities in conflict, in favour of integrative approaches, which
welcome insights from allied fields and communities, and take those insights seriously. We want our
work presented as part of this positive move forward, which is how it was conceived.
n this regard, we resist the reviewer’s recommendation that we focus on the pre-stimulus peak in
responding, and present it as evidence against “causal reasoning models”.
While the manuscript has been reduced from 46 pages to 38+ pages of text, given the apparent
simplicity of the experiment and the main findings it is hard to justify the current length of the
manuscript. I still am of the view that there are interesting ideas expressed here, but I also think the
mathematical modeling is highly distracting and should be eliminated from the manuscript. My
more specific suggestions are as follows:
* The modelling is not an inessential part of our analysis. We strongly disagree with the reviewer’s
suggestion that it can be cut. Regarding length, our paper is not long, and our previous revision
nvolved a major restructuring of the manuscript to get it as short as possible. We feel that any
further attempts to shorten would sacrifice readability and clarity. Contrary to the reviewer’s
suggestion, our analysis is not simple, and the problem we are addressing is not simple.
Furthermore, it has been quick treatments that leave assumptions unarticulated that have permitted
the controversies concerning the Blaisdell et al. study to flower and spread, largely at the expense of
genuine progress. If the editor requests, we would be willing, in principle, to cut some of the
discussion points included in order to anticipate objections (such as the section entitled “Control
conditions of Blaisdell et al., 2006”, which takes a sizeable share of the discussion with 519 words),
or perhaps move such text to a supplementary file.
Please note that the reviewer repeats his/her suggestion to cut our modelling in points 1 and 2
below (as well as in the above introductory note). These points are not independent.
1. After describing in the Introduction the causal model theory and the response competition views
n qualitative terms, perhaps the same can be done for the Behaviour Systems view (e.g., as is
depicted in Figure 2). Then after about 5 pages, the Methods section can appear. The lengthy and
difficult, assumption-rich quantitative descriptions of the various models can be avoided. The
essential idea is that the Behaviour Systems approach views behavior in these situations as an
ongoing stream of transitions from one behaviour mode to another, and that justifies providing a
more fine-grained time series analysis than is typically done.
* Behaviour systems theory is indeed introduced in qualitative terms immediately following similar
treatments of the other two hypotheses early in the introduction (under the heading “Three
explanations”).
The description of the models cannot be avoided. A primary motive for modelling is the articulation
of assumptions. A fault in contemporary science is that hypotheses often pass by being
underspecified, and this favours looser hypotheses over tighter ones. This has been amply noted. As
contemporary science is slowly moving forward on this point, the reviewer is asking us to step
backward.
2. With this approach, the Results section can also be stream-lined. For instance, Figures 5 and 6
can be eliminated. It is sufficient to show that the data do reveal important pre-stimulus
differences. That fact alone is not anticipated by the models of interest. It does little to convince
the reader of this problem for these theories by applying some curve-fitting models to show poor
quantitative fits to the data. The reason for the poor fits is the major response differences in the
pre-stimulus period. The empirical time series data in Figures 4, 7, and 8 seem important to
emphasize what would be expected of the model shown in Figure 2. But I don’t think the data
actually need to be fit quantitatively to make the important points.
* We responded above to the reviewer's suggestion to cut the modelling. Regarding Figures 5 and 6,
we concede that, in principle, we do not need to show graphically how every model fits the data.
However, we feel that all of these graphs are helpful, particularly for visually oriented readers, and
that their presence is worth their weight. We would be content to make these figures smaller, or
combine them in a figure with 4 panels (Figure 6 has 3 panels), or perhaps combine the three graphs
of Figure 6 into a single plot, if the editor requests.
3. The alternative causal model depicted in Figure 9 seems quite odd. Since this approach is
rejected anyway, I wonder whether this is essential.
* No such rejection was made. This kind of easy jumping to conclusions is a primary problem in our
field, which owes its existence to too-short explanations that leave assumptions unarticulated
permitting intuitions and preconceptions to take their place. Again, we reject CMT, and throwing out
all models like Figure 9 in the name of rejection of CMT is a clear case of throwing the baby out with
the bathwater, which we explicitly warn against. We included a section in the discussion that
explains the place of Figure 9.
4. The “direct cause (simultaneous conditioning)” and “causal chain (sensory preconditioning)”
control procedures should be spelled out when they are first introduced. This way it would be easier
for the reader to follow the points being raised.
* Simultaneous conditioning and sensory preconditioning are known procedures, with consensual
names, which allows them to be readily referred to. For extra clarity, in line with the reviewer's
suggestion, we have added a concise explication of these procedures in parentheses when they are
first mentioned.
5. The Behaviour Systems approach seems to make a rather strange prediction, namely, that the
same results should be found in groups trained initially with L – T pairings in phase 1 as well as one
given unpaired presentations of L and T in phase 1. Since all the action depends upon the
behavioural mode the animal is in just prior to and after a lever press during the test session, then it
seems that giving L-T pairings in phase 1 should not be required. There should be some discussion
about this prediction. I earlier suggested that some empirical test of it would be ideal, but, failing
that, at the very least some concrete predictions should be offered to the reader. Also, I wonder if
there is anything in the literature that would bear on this prediction. This is a critically important
issue because if the single result described here is anomalous, for some reason, then maybe the
current framework only applies to this one circumstance.
* We thank the reviewer for the suggestion, but we do not think the described experiment-results to
be a prediction of behaviour systems, depending on what he/she means by “the same results”. In
the described “unpaired” experiment, why does the reviewer expect subjects to nose a feeder above
baseline in response to T? We would gratefully include a prediction if the reviewer has another
suggestion. However, we think our analysis does not lack in terms of generativity, if that was the
reviewer's charge. One novel prediction we did present, with empirical support, is that the OBS
subjects' data at the time of lever contact could be modelled similarly (Figure 8). This was in addition
to our ability to anticipate our subjects' behaviour in greater specificity than alternative views and
prior to lever contact.
6. Similarly, the apparent inconsistency with the earlier Leising et al (2008, Expt 2) study should be
discussed. By my reading these authors failed to find any nose-poke differences in the pre-stimulus
period between their key groups. Discussing the present results in view of earlier ones speaks to the
generalizability of the findings.
* Leising et al (2008) did not report the untransformed data, so it is not clear how their subjects
behaved in the pre-stimulus period. In any case, we do direct the reader to that study in the context
of our discussion of the pre-stimulus peak (p. 35, first paragraph of the section “Anticipation of lever
contact”), and in the current revision, we have added a note to clarify the point the reviewer is
noting.
7. I didn’t find the logical arguments in the discussion section against the response competition
approach very compelling. Furthermore, the negative correlations observed by Dwyer et al during
the stimulus periods only seems sensible if there might be range restriction problems at other times
due to overall low response levels. Thus, I also didn’t find the supplemental correlational analysis
(Figure 10) very helpful.
* The negative correlation observed by Dwyer et al (and us) is expected given nothing other than the
result in focus. The result in focus is that nosing the food trough is lower during lever-initiated
stimulus periods than response-independent stimulus periods. Thus, if you just look at those
periods, you will obtain a negative correlation with lever contact, so that result alone is not only
sensible, but is actually trivial.
Figure 10 shows, however, that overall correlations are negative only in the smallest time frames. In
particular, in order for the response competition hypothesis to be able to explain the effect, which
has been phrased in 10-second periods of measurement, the correlation must be negative in 10-
second periods. As we show, it is not, a result that Dwyer et al. Also reported. Figure 10 shows the
time scale on which these response forms actually compete and the extent. Again, the response
competition explanation for the Blaisdell et al. 2006 results was intuitive but was underspecified.
Dwyer et al.'s argument in favour of response competition relied on that intuition even though the
evidence did not support it. Figure 10 helps the reader resolve how those intuitions were correct,
while being not enough to explain the observed group difference. We are confident that many
readers will appreciate the inclusion of Figure 10.
8. Finally, the fact that self-pacing behaviors showed no between-group differences makes them
hard to interpret. The authors assume that these reflect “feeding-related” behaviors, but there is no
evidence to support this. They could merely be non-specific, randomly occurring behaviors.
* General locomotion was measured because it was conceptualised (in advance) as a feeding-related
behaviour, based on prior research and theory (e.g. Timberlake, 2001). This is made clear in the
introduction. We always measure general locomotion in a feeding experiment, and always for this
reason. Such behaviours are indeed conceptualised as non-specific and probabilistic indicators of
feeding-related motivation. Note, however, that not much weight rests in this specific study on how
general locomotion is conceptualised, especially since the group difference was not significant.
Neither the CMT nor response competition views are greatly affected by whether general
locomotion is viewed as feeding-related or not. In particular, patterns of general locomotion conflict
with the response competition hypothesis irrespective of how such behaviour is conceptualised.
In short, I remain convinced that the creative extension of Behaviour Systems theory to the “causal
reasoning” experiment is interesting and newsworthy. However, I think the authors should still
considerably streamline their paper and make it more readily digestible. Only the most essential
features of the data and ideas should be conveyed to have maximal impact. Also, a better
integration with the literature in terms of unique predictions by this approach would be a welcomed
addition.
* We are glad to read that the reviewer appreciates our study. We appreciate the reviewer's
suggestions from both rounds of review, several of which led to improvements of our manuscript.
However, we have run aground on a fundamental difference of heart which appears to lie at the
core of the remaining points of disagreement. We disagree that his/her remaining suggestions
would be improvements.

Manuscript ID RSOS-171448.R2 entitled "Causal reasoning in rats' behaviour systems"
Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Mark Walton):
As requested, I solicited opinion from an additional independent reviewer. As you will see, they agreed that the work was
interesting and worthy of publication. However, in agreement with the previous reviewer (and my opinion too), they also
found the Introduction and Discussion to be lengthy, dense and argumentative. I would therefore recommend one more
round of revisions with a particular eye to trimming the Introduction (which, to my estimate, is longer even than the
Discussion) such that the background, hypotheses and aims of the study are set out *succinctly*. Moreover, the
Discussion should be toned down in line with R3's comments.

Comments to the Author(s)
I am pleased to provide some thoughts on Causal Reasoning in Rats’ Behaviour Systems.
Bowers and Timberlake have provided a unique and very interesting approach to examining causal reasoning abilities in
rats. They have offered an alternative hypothesis to causal model theory (CMT). According to the authors behaviour
systems theory generates an alternative hypothesis to CMT, and their data support this alternative. One of the most
impressive contributions of behaviour systems theory is its focus on fine grained detailed analyses of behaviour within
the experimental context. Furthermore, behavioral responses are recorded on a greater than usual temporal scale, to
include responses that precede, coincide, and follow stimulus presentations. Bowers and Timberlake studied fine grained
behavioural detail in their experiment, and conclude that behaviour systems theory provides a better account of CMT in
explaining causal reasoning in rats. This is an important contribution to the animal learning/cognition literature. I
recommend publication. I have two general comments.
The introduction, and to some extent the discussion, would benefit considerably from some trimming. I would rather the
authors get to the point more quickly. Otherwise I fear this article will only be of interest to a relatively small fraction of the
readership.
At times, especially in the discussion, I felt I was reading a transcript from an argument between the authors and
Blaisdell et al. The tone that the authors take in the discussion, in terms of the certainty by which they believe Blaisdell et
al are incorrect, to be a bit strong. The behaviour systems hypothesis may provide a better account of the data than
causal model theory, but then as is the case in science another alternative hypothesis will probably come along.
**********************************************
We appreciate Reviewer 3's comments. We found the reviewer's two critical points feasibly dealt
with, and feel that applying them has improved the manuscript.
1. We certainly do not want to sound dismissive of Blaisdell’s study, or overconfident in our own
explanation, and so we thank the reviewer for pointing out that we were coming across as such.
One hope we have for this study is that it will reinvigorate Blaisdell’s interesting question, which
lost some inertia with the Dwyer et al. (2009) study. One point we do want to communicate to
readers that there is value in looking beyond CMT to other graphical-models-based views, which
we argue may be complementary to a behaviour systems approach. In an earlier version of the
manuscript, some readers were confused by this: Were we accepting or rejecting causal
reasoning in rats? This has moved us to stress that it is specifically CMT’s explanation for the
effect that we are finding against. One consequence is that we strengthened our language, and
began to refer to our conclusion concerning the CMT explanation as a rejection. In order to
move forward, we do find it important that we identify some specific faults of CMT, especially as
these have proven easily missed, but that does not require us to appear dismissive or
argumentative (not intended, of course). The challenge we face is to express unambiguously what
we find against, without appearing to throw stones, and while attempting to make the manuscript
shorter (short + critical is often hard to sweeten). We have gone through the manuscript again
and restated points that may have sounded dismissive. We also believe that a description in
behaviour systems terms is not a complete or final explanation, but more accurately, a starting
orientation, and hope that this is apparent in the manuscript (stressed elsewhere).
2. The reviewer's second point was that the the introduction should be more succinct. The
introduction is the seat of the rationale and descriptions of the relevant theory, and it can be the
toughest part to shorten. Nevertheless, we have managed to reduce the introduction drastically.
This was achieved in part from trimming, and in part by moving content to increase efficiency of
presentation. We found that some points were raised in both the introduction and discussion,
and some points were raised twice in the introduction. For instance, there was a section in the
previous draft, “The prediction in focus”, dedicated to outlining the theoretical basis for how the
pattern of behaviour Blaisdell’s group documented was predicted, and by what view. Obviously,
that content was important, but the reader may have felt that they were revisiting covered
ground, as there was an even earlier mention of the prediction, in the opening paragraphs. In the
revised draft, the reader gets the full story the first time. We also trimmed and moved the details
of the modelling to its own section, lest those details encumber the introduction, and trimmed
the manuscript throughout. The manuscript is now much shorter, and this weight loss has
especially affected the introduction, which dropped from over 4000 words to a featherweight of
less than 1800 words.
