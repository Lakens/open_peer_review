Dear Editor,
The MS ”Adopted daughters with the lowest contributions to biological lineages have the lowest
mortality in historical Taiwan” is an original and interesting paper that seeks to test whether
there are patterned differences in mortality based on the various types of adoption practices that
are associated with differential fitness contributions to the adoptive parents. Predictions depart
from kin selection theory and to test them the authors use data from historical Taiwan where
adoption was very common but also diverse. The authors claim that results suggest that the
adopted daughters (with lowest fitness contributions) have the lowest mortality, contrary to
predictions.
I think this research is original and would be of great interest to the readership of RSOS but I
have some requests for modifications and clarifications before publication. In particular I am
concerned with the presentation of the main results, and whether the findings are robust enough
(authors discuss this themselves).
The main prediction of this paper is that adopted daughters in law (ADIL) (who will marry a son
in the household) should have lower mortality risk because they contribute more to parent’s
fitness than adopted daughters (who would not produce any biological grandchildren).
However, this result-the comparison between AD ADIL-is not tested in the MS itself but one has
to go to the ESM. Please put these in the main paper. There are some figures, but these are not
adjusted for confounders and figures themselves are difficult to read. The tables in the
Supplementary material are the ones where mortality risks between AD and ADIL are compared,
and when parity is controlled for, there is no difference between these groups. Parity seems to be
an important control variable, and results suggest that women with higher number of children
have higher survival- a result that held for all classes of daughter. But for this reason, I’m curious
as to whether the authors have decided to interpret the model without parity included as their
main result. Especially as it doesn’t even support predictions. Would it not be more logical (and
honest) based on these results, to say that there were no statistical differences between AD and
ADIL in mortality risk?
Also, one has to ask if the framework is the most suitable given that previous work cited
(Mathison et al 2015) has shown that AD have higher survival than biological daughters. What is
going on that means that kin selection in its traditional form seems insufficient to explain seen
patterns? I am not saying that this invalidates a kin selection approach, but find it a bit odd that
the paper is written as if this previous result were in the predicted direction without much
discussion.
One does wonder if there are selection processes into adoption that are acting here and that
couldn’t be accounted for in the analyses. The authors do acknowledge selection issues (e.g.
having an adoption cancelled is associated with higher mortality), but given how central the
question is and my doubts still remain, it would be advisable if this issue was tackled more
thoroughly.
The other thing I’m wondering about is the timing of death. It appears as if most deaths occur to
girls younger than 5 years after which it is fairly constant and only small differences between
3
different classes of daughters (Figure 1). Only a handful of AD or ADIL would die after
childbearing years have begun -the vast majority of the results must concern adopted daughters
as children. Yet, there is this strong relationship with the woman’s parity in later life. This issue
has to be clarified and resolved. Could you- as a robustness check restrict analyses to whether
women survive until age 5, and age 10 (binary) and see whether results hold? if mortality
differences are due to neglect of parents, you are most interested in mortality in younger ages
anyway so this wouldn't even have to be a drawback methodologically.
Specific points:
• The title could be improved (and I’m not so sure I have been convinced of the main result
conveyed here)
• Something has happened with the annotations in tables 2-4, not all explanations are given
• Not all decimals are needed in results tables. please make it more readable by rounding off
• Figure 1 and 2 are difficult to read, especially in black and white- and in figure 1, why is this
based on raw data (the models that are part of the main hypothesis is found only in the ESM).
• Page 9, line 31. It is incorrect to say that Odds ratios of 2.99 is 2.99 times as likely to die, they
have 2.99 higher odds of…
• CPH acronym is not explained. Not all will be familiar with it.
• Table S1 shows there are many 0s in the yearly age-specific mortality rates in AD and ADIL-
make age categories broader? How many inds are dying in raw numbers- please present this too.
• The focus changes across the MS. The first sentence of the conclusion starts with summarising
comparisons between bio and adopted daughters, but the set-up, and the novel analysis here is
all about the AD and ADIL differences
• Please make it clear whether in the previous paper, are results net of parity or not?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors present an interesting case of adoption among non-kin, using a large, historical
dataset from Taiwan. The data include cases of adoption that occur via "minor marriage" as well
4
as adoptions that occur for other reasons, and the main goal of the paper is to understand
whether and how these two forms of adoption differ in terms of the risks to adoptees and the
benefits to the adopting families. The most interesting finding in the paper is one that has been
previously published, that there is a protective effect of adoption for both types of adoptees,
compared to daughters raised in their natal homes. They further find that daughters who were
adopted for reasons other than for minor marriage have lower mortality risks than daughters
adopted for marriage. This latter finding is modestly interesting, but would be more so if the
authors had more ethnographic information that they could use to explain this finding. Further, I
have some reservations about the sample selection, which I think should be clarified (and
possible analyses re-run) before publication. Overall, this paper adds to the literature citing
benefits to fostering/adopting other than inclusive fitness. Here are some specific comments that
expand upon these points:
1. More information on who the AD are (as compared to ADIL) and why they have been adopted
would be welcome, if the authors do have access to this information (I recognize they may not
given that they are using an existing dataset). I imagine they are likely a very mixed category, and
so it would be interesting to see the variance in their results as compared to the ADIL.
2. I do not understand why children adopted by kin are being excluded. First, including these
children would help to answer questions about the role of kin in buffering against any potential
negative effects of adoption (e.g. of the AD are those with closer kin doing better than those with
more distant or non-kin?). I understand that the authors are trying to emphasize that there is
more than kin selection going on here (clearly with the inclusion of the ADIL) but why can't there
be multiple factors affecting mortality risk?
3. Further, the authors state that the number of AD being raised by kin is very small. However,
my calculations show that this is ~1680 girls (21,511 adoptions in the original dataset and .8% of
those are adopted by kin = 1680). The total number of adoptions included in this analysis is 1904.
So even though .8% is a small number, adding those cases back in could almost double the
number of adoptions to be analyzed!
4. In the list of kin those adoptees were adopted to, many types of kin were listed, but not
grandparents. Grandmothers are in many societies one of the most common types of adoptive
parent. Are grandparental adoptions not common in Taiwan? Why? If grandparents are being
classified differently from other kin, why? Please explain.
Some additional Points:
1. The authors make an interesting point that where minor marriage is common, the daughters
being raised by the biological parents may actually be the least desirable (and therefore it is
unsurprising that they would have a higher mortality risk) because the higher quality daughters
are the ones who have been adopted through marriage. Is there a way to test this prediction?
2. There has been quite a bit of work done looking at adoption as beneficial to the adoptive
parents. These citations should be read and cited in this paper, most notably the famous work of
Caroline Bledsoe. For example:

grannies in Sierra Leone." [Unpublished] 1985. Presented at the Annual Meeting of the

ar Editor(s),
ank you and the two anonymous reviewers for your constructive comments and
ommendations on our manuscript, now titled “Adopted daughters and daughters-in-law
aiwan: A mortality analysis.” We have made extensive revisions to the manuscript in
t of the reviewers’ suggestions. The main areas of revision are as follows:
1) We have performed additional analyses that reinforce our main result – that
adopted daughters (AD) out-survive adopted daughters-in-law (ADIL). In retaining
this as the central result, we have nonetheless reorganized the introductory
material to streamline our arguments and focus more strongly on the differences
between types of adoption in mortality outcomes.
2) We have provided some additional ethnographic information on the general context
of parenting and adoption in Taiwan that serves to bolster the speculation that
biological daughters who remained in the care of their parents may have been
disfavored relative to adopted daughters.
merous additional changes were made to improve the quality and coherence of the
nuscript. These are detailed in the point-by-point response, below.
ank you for this opportunity to resubmit our revised manuscript. We hope that it is now
ropriate for publication in Royal Society Open Science, but continue to welcome
gestions to improve the manuscript further.

e main prediction of this paper is that adopted daughters in law (ADIL) (who will marry
on in the household) should have lower mortality risk because they contribute more to
ent’s fitness than adopted daughters (who would not produce any biological
ndchildren). However, this result-the comparison between AD ADIL-is not tested in the
itself but one has to go to the ESM. Please put these in the main paper.
have added the analysis to the main paper and note that the result is significant until we
parity as a co-variate, which results in a significant loss of power, because it is time-
endent.
ere are some figures, but these are not adjusted for confounders and figures themselves
difficult to read.
have redrawn figures to be clearly interpretable in black and white. We have added a new
re that summarizes the comparison of AD to ADIL while controlling for covariates, based
Model 5 in the main text.
e tables in the Supplementary material are the ones where mortality risks between AD
ADIL are compared, and when parity is controlled for, there is no difference between
se groups. Parity seems to be an important control variable, and results suggest that
men with higher number of children have higher survival- a result that held for all
sses of daughter. But for this reason, I’m curious as to whether the authors have decided
nterpret the model without parity included as their main result. Especially as it doesn’t
n support predictions. Would it not be more logical (and honest) based on these results,
ay that there were no statistical differences between AD and ADIL in mortality risk?
believe that the result that AD out-survive ADIL is real and this is bolstered by the
itional analyses performed in association with this revision in response to R1’s suggestions
e below). We include the analysis with parity in the ESM and refer to it several times in the
nuscript so that readers may make direct comparisons to assess how parity affects the
del.
o, one has to ask if the framework is the most suitable given that previous work cited
athison et al 2015) has shown that AD have higher survival than biological daughters.
at is going on that means that kin selection in its traditional form seems insufficient to
lain seen patterns? I am not saying that this invalidates a kin selection approach, but
d it a bit odd that the paper is written as if this previous result were in the predicted
ection without much discussion.
discussed in the manuscript (e.g., lines 59-74), the kin selection framework is the most
mon evolutionary framework used to explore the effects of adoption (and related
nomena) on life history outcomes. We appreciate that this is perhaps too narrow an
roach and, indeed, that the attempt to salvage kin selection through the prediction about
IL was not successful. We have completely reorganized the introductory material to clarify
y we have chosen to test a narrow version of kin selection theory and to foreshadow
rnative explanations that are discussed in the discussion section.
e does wonder if there are selection processes into adoption that are acting here and
t couldn’t be accounted for in the analyses. The authors do acknowledge selection issues
. having an adoption cancelled is associated with higher mortality), but given how
tral the question is and my doubts still remain, it would be advisable if this issue was
kled more thoroughly.
re are two potential sources of selection bias in these data – the first and arguably most
ortant in terms of inferences about mortality is relevant only to the comparison between
logical daughters and adopted daughters. In this case, because a girl has to live long
ugh to be adopted, it is possible that mortality that would ultimately belong to a daughter
rked for adoption would be attributed to biological daughters. This issue was dealt with in
ttison et al. 2015 by using both time-dependent covariates and by restricting the analyses
irls that had lived to at least age 6 months (before which, the largest fraction of deaths
uld have occurred).
ause adopted daughters (both AD and ADIL) in our data are being tracked solely from the
nt of adoption forward, the mortality selection that causes inferential problems for the
parison between BD and AD does not arise. Rather, the selection bias that may arise in the
parisons performed in this paper is due to the possibility that healthier girls are being
cted as AD. This selection bias does not affect inferences about the actual patterns of
rtality, but about the sources of mortality. We have clarified possible selection issues in the
thods section in a new footnote.
e other thing I’m wondering about is the timing of death. It appears as if most deaths
ur to girls younger than 5 years after which it is fairly constant and only small
erences between different classes of daughters (Figure 1). Only a handful of AD or ADIL
uld die after childbearing years have begun -the vast majority of the results must
cern adopted daughters as children. Yet, there is this strong relationship with the
man’s parity in later life. This issue has to be clarified and resolved. Could you- as a
ustness check restrict analyses to whether women survive until age 5, and age 10
nary) and see whether results hold? if mortality differences are due to neglect of
ents, you are most interested in mortality in younger ages anyway so this wouldn't even
e to be a drawback methodologically.
thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have performed these analyses, which are now
luded in the ESM. Four sets of analyses were conducted: 1) Whether an adopted girl who
vived at least to six months survives to age 10 (relative log odds for ADIL v. AD -0.338*); 2)
ether an adopted girl who survived to at least six months survives to age 5 (relative log
s for ADIL v. AD -0.394**); whether an adopted daughter survives to age 10 (relative log
s for ADIL v. AD -0.343*); and whether an adopted daughter survives to age 5 (relative log
s for ADIL v. AD -0.391**). In every case, adopted daughters out-survive adopted
ghters-in-law. The effect is stronger for survivorship to age 5 than to age 10, which is
sistent with the largest differences in mortality arising early in life. As per our response
ut selection biases, above, the sample of adopted daughters is affected little by truncating
ge 6 months, so the removal of girls who did not survive to 6 months has little effect on
ameter estimates. We agree with the reviewer that this is not a methodological drawback
en the distribution of mortality.
result that parity and fertility are related is discussed at lines x-y and is not a main focus
his manuscript, but is discussed because parity is widely hypothesized to affect mortality
ing and following the childbearing years. We have underscored throughout the
nuscript that our emphasis is on early-life mortality.

mments to the Author(s)
e authors present an interesting case of adoption among non-kin, using a large, historical
aset from Taiwan. The data include cases of adoption that occur via "minor marriage" as
ll as adoptions that occur for other reasons, and the main goal of the paper is to
derstand whether and how these two forms of adoption differ in terms of the risks to
ptees and the benefits to the adopting families. The most interesting finding in the
er is one that has been previously published, that there is a protective effect of adoption
both types of adoptees, compared to daughters raised in their natal homes. They further
d that daughters who were adopted for reasons other than for minor marriage have
er mortality risks than daughters adopted for marriage. This latter finding is modestly
eresting, but would be more so if the authors had more ethnographic information that
y could use to explain this finding.
have drawn upon additional ethnographic information that describes the quality of care
aiwan during this time period and suggests that treatment of both biological and non-
logical offspring was often harsh.
ther, I have some reservations about the sample selection, which I think should be
rified (and possible analyses re-run) before publication. Overall, this paper adds to the
rature citing benefits to fostering/adopting other than inclusive fitness.
thank the reviewer for their comments. Indeed, there is a very small literature on adoption
fosterage that considers approaches other than kin selection. The fact that AD out-survive
IL contributes to that perspective and also demonstrates that adoption arises for different
poses in different contexts and is not a monolithic category.
re are some specific comments that expand upon these points:
More information on who the AD are (as compared to ADIL) and why they have been
pted would be welcome, if the authors do have access to this information (I recognize
y may not given that they are using an existing dataset). I imagine they are likely a very
ed category, and so it would be interesting to see the variance in their results as
mpared to the ADIL.
nographic evidence suggests that the AD were typically adopted to households to serve as
nd-ins for lacking biological children. We confirmed that they were adopted to households
h fewer adoptive siblings, which may also account for some of why they fare better than
IL. We have added this information to the discussion section.
do not understand why children adopted by kin are being excluded. First, including
se children would help to answer questions about the role of kin in buffering against
potential negative effects of adoption (e.g. of the AD are those with closer kin doing
ter than those with more distant or non-kin?). I understand that the authors are trying
mphasize that there is more than kin selection going on here (clearly with the inclusion
he ADIL) but why can't there be multiple factors affecting mortality risk?
s is an excellent question. Unfortunately, after applying exclusion criteria, there are only
girls who were adopted by family members. The sample size precludes a robust statistical
lysis.
urther, the authors state that the number of AD being raised by kin is very small.
wever, my calculations show that this is ~1680 girls (21,511 adoptions in the original
aset and .8% of those are adopted by kin = 1680). The total number of adoptions
luded in this analysis is 1904. So even though .8% is a small number, adding those cases
k in could almost double the number of adoptions to be analyzed!
ase see above. Additionally, this is 188 adopted girls prior to exclusions (0.87% of 21,511
al cases), again resulting in too small a sample to perform robust analyses.
n the list of kin those adoptees were adopted to, many types of kin were listed, but not
ndparents. Grandmothers are in many societies one of the most common types of
ptive parent. Are grandparental adoptions not common in Taiwan? Why? If
ndparents are being classified differently from other kin, why? Please explain.
thank the reviewer for drawing this to our attention. There were, indeed 7 cases of
dren (both boys and girls) being officially adopted by grandparents. We have excluded
se cases from our analyses to retain the focus on non-kin adoption and given issues of
ple size. The small number of official adoptions by grandparents is consistent with the
tural context of adoption in Taiwan at this time where near-kin adoptions were more
mon to aunts and uncles.
me additional Points:
he authors make an interesting point that where minor marriage is common, the
ghters being raised by the biological parents may actually be the least desirable (and
refore it is unsurprising that they would have a higher mortality risk) because the
her quality daughters are the ones who have been adopted through marriage. Is there a
y to test this prediction?
as far as we are aware using the data that we have available to us. We do show in the
plemental material that it is the biological daughters’ whose mortality deviates most
ongly from the anticipated mortality patterns in the first five years of life, with ADILs
wing excess deaths in the following five. This provides suggestive, but certainly not
clusive, evidence that biological daughters were disfavored. We also cite an additional
nographic source that speaks to the harsh treatment of biological children in Taiwan
ing this time period.

ents. These citations should be read and cited in this paper, most notably the famous
