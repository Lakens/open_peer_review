Abstract: Information theory is gaining popularity as a tool to characterise performance of
biological systems. However, information is commonly quantified without reference to whether
4
or how a system could extract and use it; as a result, information-theoretic quantities are easily
misinterpreted. Here we take the example of pattern-forming developmental systems which are
commonly structured as cascades of sequential gene expression steps. Such a multi-tiered
structure appears to constitute sub-optimal use of the positional information provided by the
input morphogen because noise is added at each tier. However, one must distinguish between
the total information in a morphogen and information that can be usefully extracted and
interpreted by downstream elements. We demonstrate that quantifying the information that is
accessible to the system naturally explains the prevalence of multi-tiered network architectures as
a consequence of the noise inherent to the control of gene expression. We support our argument
with empirical observations from patterning along the major body axis of the fruit fly embryo.
We use this example to highlight the limitations of the standard information-theoretic
characterisation of biological signaling, which are frequently de-emphasized, and illustrate how
they can be resolved.

SPONSE TO REVIEWERS
IEWER #1
thank the reviewer for identifying several issues with the presentation of the model and the
nuscript more generally. These issues are fully addressed in the revised version and the primary
ntion of the manuscript is clarified.
following two points are related and we address them together below:
found the title a bit too colloquial and not descriptive enough of the actual work in the paper.
he authors try too hard in the introduction to imply that their findings explain a very broad category
iochemical networks. This is quite off-putting. The text should instead focus on gradient-sensing
works where the author's experiments and theory are directly applicable. To me, this would increase
er than decrease the impact of the work.
reviewer is correct: our results section focuses on a very specific class of biochemical networks. The
nuscript is very explicit about this, formulating the specific problem very narrowly as explaining the
ttern of broad subdivision followed by short-range refinement” observed in multiple developmental
grams (lines 63, 71). However, for us, this specific result is less important than the very general point
ustrates, and the manuscript is structured accordingly. The main message of the manuscript is that
essing the usefulness of a signal must always take into account the so-called input noise of the
nstream circuit interpreting this signal. This is a completely general point, which is not controversial
ong specialists (lines 95, 365-369, references [3, 42, 52]), and whose relevance extends far beyond
ded-signal-responsive networks. Our intention was to provide a particularly instructive illustration.
neither state nor imply that our results directly “explain a broad category of biochemical networks”.
he contrary, we emphasize repeatedly that our results are derived in a highly simplified context
es 93, 117, 253, 370) where the difference between raw and accessible information becomes
ecially clear; however, our goal was to communicate the generality of the caveats our example
trates (lines 365-369).
these reasons, we believe that the title of the work reflects its intention exactly. To clarify this
ntion and address the reviewer’s concerns, we toned down the abstract (it no longer contrasts our
roach with “conventional theory”; and “we exhibit limitations” was replaced by “we highlight the
tations that are frequently de-emphasized”), and edited the main text to better separate the specific
mple we use and the general point it illustrates. In particular, we entirely re-wrote the final
agraph of the discussion summarizing our work (lines 365-369).
n general, I found the description of the model (in words) to be overly complicated and hard to
ow. The authors should consider simplifying it or, better yet, using analogies to other types of circuits
ctronics comes to mind) and standardized terms (gain, noise, readout noise, etc.) to make the
ings easier to understand.
agree with the reviewer. In the revised manuscript, we resolve the ambiguity of wordy descriptions
ocusing on clarity of mathematical expressions. We introduced a consistent notation for all random
ables and provide explicit expressions for all variables we construct. We also modified Fig. 2,
anding it to improve clarity. With regard to using other standard terms for noise, see next point.
elated to #3, I believe that there is a mistake in the authors description of the different types of
e being considered. The central result of the paper (Eq 6) relies on the two-tier model having both
-dependent and gain-independent sources of noise. These are introduced in line 146 and Eq 4,
pectively. The former (line 146) is listed as gain dependent and the authors explain it as reflecting
e intrinsic stochasticity of transcription and, in principle, many other noise sources." This sounds to
like output noise which should be gain *independent*. The later, Eq 4, a noisy estimate of the input
he circuit, is input noise and should be gain *dependent*, again the opposite of what is implied in
derivation of Eq 6. In the end, both noise sources are present in Eq 6 which is then correct. But, the
vation of where these terms come from in a realistic biological network is explained in too sloppy a
nner.
thank the reviewer for bringing our attention to this point, which was very important to clarify in the
. Our model considers only one type of noise; it is denoted <U+0001D702> and always corresponds to the input
e of a readout circuit. Its biochemical origin is the intrinsic noise of transcriptional regulation, e.g.
dom arrival of molecules at their targets or the promoter switching noise. Its description in the
inal manuscript was imprecise and caused confusion. In the revised manuscript, this mistake was
ected (lines 115-116).
q. 6, this same noise enters twice, corresponding to the two readout operations required in the two-
strategy. The second of these readouts occurs after amplification. Therefore, in this expression, the
ut noise of the hypothetical circuit that will be interpreting signal <U+0001D450>^ (<U+0001D706>) formally appears in the same
as would the output (“gain-independent”) noise of the amplification step <U+0001D450>^ <U+2192> <U+0001D450>^ (<U+0001D706>) .
shows that in our case, when the output of one circuit is the input to another, using terms such as
n-dependent” or “gain-independent” noise would create more confusion than it would clarify. Since
y one type of noise is considered, it is sufficient to be clear about its nature. In the revised
nuscript, we:
1) Stress that <U+0001D702> is the only noise source considered in our model (line 117).
2) Describe its biochemical origin (lines 115-116), and use the standard term “input noise” of a
circuit (lines 96, 117, 184, 313, 320, 368).
3) Revised our notations for consistency and spelled out the expressions for all stochastic variables
we use (e.g., Eqs. 1-2).
resolves the confusion identified by the reviewer.
IEWER #2
thank the reviewer for pointing out the instances where our notation was sloppy and the shortcuts
lear. These technical concerns are fully addressed in the revised manuscript, notations were made
sistent with standard usage, and this did in fact substantially improve the clarity of the argument.
he revised manuscript, the confusing notation c(x) was eliminated entirely (except in the
oductory cartoon where it is appropriate, as it labels the concentration profile rather than a random
able). Following the suggestion of the reviewer, we introduced a consistent “hat” notation for all
dom variables and follow it throughout the text, replacing <U+0001D43C>[<U+0001D450>(<U+0001D465>), <U+0001D465>] by <U+0001D43C>[<U+0001D450>^ , <U+0001D465>^], etc. The calculation in
SI was corrected (see next item). All usage of subscript “i” was removed.
to a typo in this section of SI, averaging over <U+0001D465> was missing from the definition of mutual
rmation (second equation, in the second term). We corrected this mistake. The rest of the math is
n correct.
reviewer is correct that <U+0001D443>(<U+0001D465>) and <U+0001D443>(<U+0001D450>) cannot both be exactly uniform; we clarified that our
ression for information content of a linear gradient is derived under the assumption of small noise.
is also the case for the rest of the manuscript, and is now stated explicitly (lines 146, 222).
ike the discrete entropy, the differential entropy, which extends the notion of entropy to continuous
bability distributions, can be negative and indeed tends to -8 for perfectly deterministic functions.
articular, a perfectly deterministic continuous function of a continuous input would carry an infinite
ount of information. In the limit <U+0001D70E>0 <U+2192> 0, the formula calculated in this section of the SI yields this
ect result.
he same time, the reviewer correctly points out that for a finite number of cells, the amount of
rmation is always finite. Using the expressions from the continuous case in our argument constitutes
mplicit assumption, namely that the number of cells is sufficiently large that their discreteness can
neglected, and the explicit expression for the validity of this assumption invokes the magnitude of
e. This is an important point; it is now explicitly mentioned in the main text (line 146) and detailed in
SI. We comment on the validity of this assumption for the Drosophila system we consider (same
ion of the SI).
apologize for the confusing notation. The reviewer is exactly correct: <U+0001D43C><U+0001D44E><U+0001D450><U+0001D450> 0
= <U+0001D43C>[<U+0001D450>^ (0) + <U+0001D702>^ ; <U+0001D465>^]. We
ne the accessible information in <U+0001D450>^ as the raw information of <U+0001D450>^ <U+0001D452><U+0001D460><U+0001D461> = <U+0001D450>^ + <U+0001D702>^ , and the accessible
rmation in <U+0001D450>^ (0) as the raw information of <U+0001D450>^ (0) <U+0001D452><U+0001D460><U+0001D461> = <U+0001D450>^ (0) + <U+0001D702>^ , etc. We agree with the reviewer that
use of superscript “estimate” was not clear. Writing out the full expressions for all random variables
h which we operate, as the reviewer did in their comments, is the clearest approach. The revised
nuscript follows this strategy throughout the text (new Eqs. 1, 2, 5 and the unnumbered equation
owing line 212 ). The step from Eq. 4 to Eqs. 5 and 6 is now straightforward.
reviewer is again correct. The manuscript was revised to clarify this issue (new Eqs. 2 and 6).
is a valid point, also made by Reviewer #1. The revised manuscript stresses that our simplified
del considers only one type of noise; it is denoted <U+0001D702> and always corresponds to the input noise of a
dout circuit. Its biochemical origin is the intrinsic noise of transcriptional regulation, e.g. random
val of molecules at their targets or the promoter switching noise. Its description in the original
nuscript was imprecise and caused confusion. In the revised manuscript, this mistake was corrected
es 115-116). The extra figure suggested by the reviewer describing “each noise source” appears
ecessary, since the model considers only one source of noise, as the revised manuscript clarifies (line
).
IEWER #3
reviewer is correct: the difference between raw and accessible information as we defined it is due
nput noise, whose importance has been realized in the past (lines 95-96, 365-376). The manuscript
ctly states that the main message of the work “is implicit in the theoretical work investigating input
e, but has not been emphasized” (lines 312-313). It is our view that this point, although understood
nformation theorists, is not sufficiently appreciated by all practitioners; we discuss this in the
oduction and provide references (lines 13-16, 87-93). The reviewer is correct that in the example we
se, the difference between raw and accessible information is especially clear; this is precisely why we
se it. Our goal was to emphasize a theoretical point and demonstrate its implications in a biologically
vant example that speaks to everyone who uses information theory, or encounters it in the
ature. The revised manuscript stresses that the caveats of over- or mis-interpreting standard
rmation-theoretic concepts, and their relevance reaching far beyond Drosophila is not controversial
ong specialists and is supported by other studies (lines 312-313, refs. [3, 42, 52]). Our intention was
rovide a particularly instructive illustration; we believe this is timely. We edited the introduction
es 95-96) and rewrote the concluding paragraph of the paper (lines 365-376) to clarify this intention.
our knowledge, our noise estimation technique is indeed new, and it is our hope that this aspect of
work will also be useful to some readers. However, the manuscript is primarily not about Drosophila,
about information theory, and the emphasis is placed accordingly.
manuscript states that we focus on this region and these genes because “other inputs to eve are
ligible in this region at this time” (results, line 258); references [46,47] are provided. The reviewer is
ect that focusing on one small region would be a poor approach to understanding the details of
ulation of eve or its specific role in patterning of Drosophila. However, it is a perfectly valid setting to
trate the conceptual point made in the manuscript: a downstream gene may be noisier and carry
raw information, yet its presence can serve to make this information more accessible (lines 295-
). Elaborating on this point, line 300 in the Results states: “our framework demonstrates that even if
were regulated by Hb and Kr only, and so were fully redundant in the standard information-
oretic sense, the additional tier would still confer an advantage, because transcription is intrinsically
y.” Note that we do not claim that Eve is indeed regulated by Hb and Kr only, in fact it need not be
case; once again, our focus is on the theoretical point, not on Drosophila specifically.
re are two possible answers. The shortest is that in our model, each time window of length <U+0001D70F> gives
s access to an independent sample of the random variable <U+0001D450>^ (lines 111, 124-125, 130). The
rmediate signal established by time T is based on past drawings of <U+0001D450>^ . Therefore, the two signals
^ (<U+0001D706>) } to which a cell has access at a given moment in time, and whose joint information we consider,
wholly independent (within our simplified model). Accounting for correlations is possible, but not
essary to prove the qualitative statement that serves as the title of that section: “Multiple tiers can
rove gradient interpretation even when raw information decreases”.
ore subtle observation is that the argument presented in this section of the manuscript can be
rmulated so as to become immune to the problem of correlations, even if they were present. For
, we can introduce a discrete “segment” variable <U+0001D460>^ which is a binning of the original morphogen into
ns, and use it instead of <U+0001D450>^ in joint information calculations. We added a new section to the SI
ailing this argument (“Joint accessible information and the zigzag profile z”). Since <U+0001D460>^ is a discrete
able, in the small-noise approximations it has no correlations that could reduce the joint information
tent.
also added a mention of the issue of correlations in another place where it is relevant (lines 269-271,
-281) and added a reference [49] that investigates it in Drosophila for the genes we consider.
reviewer is correct that the DV dependence of gene expression has a confounding effect on noise
mation. Our method, whereby we compare expression in a given nucleus only with its immediate
hbors rather than with all nuclei along the imaginary DV axis, was developed precisely to mitigate
effect. The residual systematic errors of this procedure can be quantified by observing the residual
ematic trends in the scatter plot of inferred expression fluctuations vs AP location, as we do in the SI
s. S2, S3; see SI for details). The fact that the magnitude of the residual systematic bias (Fig. S3B,
d black line) is significantly smaller than the magnitude of measured noise (root-mean-square scatter
ed datapoints) confirms that the procedure we developed successfully eliminates most of the
ematic errors due to DV dependence of expression profiles, so that the residual deviations are
inated by a DV-independent component of the noise. We expanded this section of the SI to clarify
point. This verification is the best test available with static data.
ss-validating this experimental method using live imaging data would be a good test appropriate for
rosophila-centered study, but is beyond the scope of this work where our main point is theoretical.
is a valid point. Our term “gradient response problem” was meant as a shorter equivalent of
ponse to a graded input signal”, but we now see that this shorthand terminology is somewhat
leading. We corrected our phrasing to avoid ambiguity.
