Title: Acute biotoxicity assessment of heavy metals in sewage sludge based on the glucose
consumption of Escherichia coli
This manuscript deals with acute biotoxicity assessment of heavy metals in sewage sludge in
basis on the glucose metabolism of E. coli. Results indicated that the biotoxicity of five single
heavy metals in sewage to E. coli following the order: Hg2+ > As3+ > Cu2+ > Zn2+ > Cd2+. The
combined biotoxicity of Cu2++Zn2+, Cu2++Cd2+ and Cu2++Hg2+ exhibited synergistic effects,
while the antagonistic effects were produced by Cu2++As3+ and Cd2++Zn2+. It is meaningful
for exploring a sensitive and potable method for acute biotoxicity assessment of heavy metals in
sewage sludge. However, the language is a big problem. Moreover, correct format and pretty
language are important for article published. Therefore, I recommend this paper can be accepted
after major revision. Specific suggestions are provided below.
Specific comments:
1. E. coli was the model bacterium studied in this study. Why did parameter optimization of
bioassay in terms of B. subtilis investigate? Can you explain?
2. In page 8, lines 50-55, “In order to facilitate the setting of binary heavy metal concentration, the
concentrations of Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+ and As3+ were defined as A at 10, 20, 20, 10 and 3 mg
L-1, respectively.”. The authors are suggested to explain why there are significant differences in
the concentrations of these heavy metals, and clarify the influences of concentration parameters
on their biotoxicity assessment.
3. In section of 3.4 “Joint biotoxicity assessment of binary heavy metals in sewage”, the authors
evaluated the joint biotoxicity assessment of binary heavy metals; however, comparative
experiments, such as the control and the single heavy metal groups, should be carried out.
4. In the parts of ‘Abstract’, ‘4. Discussion’, and ‘conclusion’, authors should make the article
more visualized, accurate, and rigorous.
5. Statistical analyses on data in Figs. 3, 4, 7 and S1 were not carried out using ANOVA. I suggest
the authors to add the statistical analysis.
6. Many grammatical mistakes in the paper should be carefully corrected, tenses of sentences
need to be consistent and corrected.
7. Many language expressions should be polished during the revision. Please improve the
language greatly.
8. I also recommend that authors add some newly references concerning removal of heavy
metals, such as Journal of Hazardous Materials 289 (2015) 174-183, Journal of Hazardous
Materials 321 (2017) 37-46, Chemosphere 196 (2018) 575-584, Chemosphere 203 (2018) 199-208,

This is an interesting paper. I have following suggestion or comments:
1. English should be further improved thorough the paper.
2. Metal ions like Cu2+, Zn2+ should be written as Cu(II), Zn(II), because the former refers to free
metal ions, which are not right here;
3. You spiked high concentration of metals to the sludge. But, fresh metal in sludge is different
from the aged metal. So, your results are difficult to scale-up to real metal contaminated sludge.
4. Beside sludge metal, some salts also affect the enzymatic activity, and consequently changed
the metabolism of glucose by E. Coli. So, it will be better to provide data about the salt in the
sludge.

Response to Reviewers:
Reviewer: 1
(1) Page 6, 15-19: The presented reason of mixing real sludge and fresh
soil is inaccurate.
Response: We have checked the presented reason of mixing real sludge
and fresh soil as “Due to the high content and strong biotoxicity of heavy
metals in the sewage sludge, the toxicants have exceeded the detection
range by microbial method. To improve the sensitivity of the PGM method,
spiked sludge was prepared by industrial park sludge and fresh soil with
different mixed ratio. Then, added the reagents (CuSO4•5H2O,
ZnSO4•7H2O, CdSO4•8/3H2O and NaAsO2) into the heavy metal extract
solution to obtain different concentrates of spiked sludge, respectively.” In
the supplement material, we have replaced “the mixed ratio of real sludge
and fresh soil were prepared as 1: 5, 1: 10 and 1: 20” by “the mixed ratio
of real sludge and fresh soil were prepared as 1: 4, 1: 9 and 1: 19”.
(2) Page 7, 35-37: The statement that “[a]t the nontoxic environment, E.
coli can consume less glucose than a toxic environment” is
contradictory to the information presented in picture 1.
Response: We have checked the mistake and it has been described as
“At the nontoxic environment, E. coli can consume more glucose than a
toxic environment.”
(3) Page 7, 47: the lack of description of “OD600”
Response: We have descripted “OD600” in section of 2.2. “OD600” is the
meaning of “the optical density of bacterial suspension solution at 600 nm”.
Therefore, we didn’t descript it again in the following sections.
(4) Page 8, 33-41: the lack of comment for table 1, i.e. the value IC50 for
Cd2+ which is almost twice as high as the literature data no 23.
Response: In table 1, we have compared the IC50 values by measuring
glucose consumption with other methods. Different methods and
experimental condition have different IC50 values for the same heavy
metal. In the section of 3.3, we have added some references [29,30,33,35]
to demonstrated that lots of IC50 values of Cd2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Hg2+ to E. coli
by using glucose consumption inhibition method were lower than other
methods. And, it also can be seen that Hg2+ had the highest biological
toxicity for different microbial species with different methods.
(5) Page 9, 39: The sentence “The mixed ratio of real sludge and fresh
soil were 1:10” is the repetition of the information from page 6, 17-18.
Response: We have checked the mistakes in page 6, 17-18 and deleted
those phrases. In Page 9, 39, we have replaced “The mixed ratio of real
sludge and fresh soil were 1: 10” by “The mixed ratio of real sludge and
fresh soil were 1: 9”.
(6) Page 10, 29-30: The sentence “PGM is usually used to measure the
blood glucose through the electric flow of glucose produced in blood
samples in the medicine studies.” is the repetition of the information from
page 3, 8-13
Response: We have deleted those repeated phrases and make the part
of “Discussion” more accurate. The first paragraph of the “Discussion”
was amended as” In recent years, some researches have indicated that
heavy metals and other pollutants inhibited the glucose oxidase or
glucose dehydrogenase of bacteria, which were related with glucose
production [30,38,39]. A higher PGM signal was detected with the
increase of Cu2+ and Zn2+ concentration [40]. Under the consistent
parameter optimization of bioassay in terms of E. coli and B. subtilis
concentration, culture temperature and OD600 values [41,42], E. coli were
more sensitive and suitable for heavy metal biotoxicity assessment in the
following studies.”
(7) Reference: Publications (i.e. 33,43,45) are too old; they were
published before 2010.
Response: We have updated the [45] to the [47]. In order to compared
IC50 values of heavy metal and the combine effect of Cd2++Zn2+ and
Cu2++Cd2+, some publications needed to be older and it can shows the
sensitivity of this new method. In this paper, there are only two
publications were published before 2010.
(8) Figures 2-4: Unclear markings of points with Cu2+ and without Cu2+.
Response: We have marked the points in Figures 2-4 again. For
example:
Figure 2. Principle analysis of biotoxicity assessment based on the
microbial glucose metabolism: (a) the glucose concentration-time curve
with or without the existence of Cu2+ (20 mg L-1); (b) the final glucose
concentration-Cu2+ concentration curve when samples were incubated for
60 min.
Reviewer: 2
1. E. coli was the model bacterium studied in this study. Why did
parameter optimization of bioassay in terms of B. subtilis investigate?
Can you explain?
Response: At the beginning of the experience, we don’t know which
bacteria were more suitable for the following research. In the experience
of the inhibition rate of microbe to Cu2+ and Zn2+, we have demonstrated
that E. coli was more sensitive for the heavy metal biotoxicity assessment.
For the following parameter optimization of bioassay experiences, we just
used E. coli as the model microbe.
2. In page 8, lines 50-55, “In order to facilitate the setting of binary heavy
metal concentration, the concentrations of Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+ and
As3+ were defined as A at 10, 20, 20, 10 and 3 mg L-1, respectively.”.
The authors are suggested to explain why there are significant
differences in the concentrations of these heavy metals, and clarify
the influences of concentration parameters on their biotoxicity
assessment.
Response: Different heavy metal ions have different toxic equivalent to
the bacteria at the same concentration. In addition, different heavy metal
ions have exhibited different toxic concentrations in the environment. In
our study, the acute biotoxicity assessment of single heavy metal in
sludge has also showed that the biotoxicity order of single heavy metal to
E. coli was Hg2+ > As3+ > Cu2+ > Zn2+ > Cd2+. In order to explain the
combined effect between binary heavy metals, we should make different
single heavy metal showed as almost same toxicity. Therefore, the
concentrations of Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+ and As3+ were defined as A at 10,
20, 20, 10 and 3 mg L-1, respectively.
3. In section of 3.4 “Joint biotoxicity assessment of binary heavy metals
in sewage”, the authors evaluated the joint biotoxicity assessment of
binary heavy metals; however, comparative experiments, such as the
control and the single heavy metal groups, should be carried out.
Response: The evaluated of joint biotoxicity assessment of binary heavy
metals was based on the compare between single and binary heavy metal
groups. And, it has showed as synergy effect or antagonism effect
between two heavy metals. For example, synergistic effect response to E.
coli occurred when Cu2++Zn2+ mixed together. It was means that the joint
biotoxicity of Cu2++Zn2+ was greater than the single heavy metal (Cu2+ or
Zn2+) at the same concentration. In addition, we have also explained why
it was showed as synergy effect or antagonism effect between two heavy
metals in the third paragraph of the “Discussion”. It was described as “This
might be ascribed that Cu2+ was more bioavailable than other ions, which
could enlarged the cell membrane permeability when Cu2+ and Cd2+
coexistence in binary mixture. On the other hand, Zn2+ and Cd2+
coexistence would decrease the system toxicity due to the formation of
less bioavailable complex than both single heavy metals [27].” Therefore,
we think that it didn’t need to do some comparative experiments between
the single and binary heavy metal groups. If we do, there will be many
repeated data and conclusions in this paper.
4. In the parts of ‘Abstract’, ‘4. Discussion’, and ‘conclusion’, authors
should make the article more visualized, accurate, and rigorous.
Response: We have checked the grammatical mistakes and adjusted the
article statement in the parts of “Abstract”, “Discussion” and “Conclusion”,
and make the article more visualized, accurate, and rigorous. For example,
we have amended the “Conclusion” as “The systems of PGM and E. coli
can detected the single and joint biotoxicity of heavy metal ions in sewage
sludge. The IC50 values of Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+ and As3+ were 10.3, 12.9,
24.3, 2.8 and 6.9 mg L-1 in sewage, respectively, revealing that Hg2+ was
the most toxic ion to E. coli. The biotoxicity of binary heavy metals and
four real sludge samples were also successfully assessed. In conclusion,
our study offered an economic, timely and sensitive alternative for acute
bio-toxicity assessment of pollutants monitoring in sewage sludge.”
5. Statistical analyses on data in Figs. 3, 4, 7 and S1 were not carried out
using ANOVA. I suggest the authors to add the statistical analysis.
Response: We have added the statistical analysis on data in Fig. 3, 4, 7
and S1. For example:
Figure 3. The inhibition rate of microbe to heavy metals under different
experimental conditions: (a) E. coli and B. subtilis to Cu2+ and Zn2+; (b)
The incubation temperature of E. coli with 10 mg L-1 Cu2+; (c) The OD600
values of E. coli with 10 mg L-1 Cu2+. Data points represent the average of
three replicates.
6. Many grammatical mistakes in the paper should be carefully corrected,
tenses of sentences need to be consistent and corrected.
Response: We have checked the grammatical mistakes in this paper by
ourselves and an expert who can effectively write and convey in English.
For example, we have replaced the “Abstract: As a simple and feasible
method for acute biotoxicity assessment, personal glucose meter (PGM)
has been stared used in the early warning of environmental pollutants in
sewage. Based on the glucose metabolism of Escherichia coli (E. coli),
our study described acute biotoxicity of single and joint heavy metal in
sewage and real sludge samples. The biotoxicity order of five single
heavy metals in sewage to E. coli was Hg2+ > As3+ > Cu2+ > Zn2+ > Cd2+.
The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of Hg2+ was 2.8 mg
L-1. The joint heavy metals of Cu2++Zn2+, Cu2++Cd2+ and Cu2++Hg2+
produced synergistic effects and Cu2++As3+ and Cd2++Zn2+ produced
antagonistic effects for the combined biotoxicity. In spiked sludge with
heavy metal, Cd2+ and Zn2+ have the higher biotoxicity than Cu2+ and As3+.
With the real sludge biotoxicity assessment, the electroplate factory and
housing estate sludges showed the highest and lowest inhibition rates
were 57.4 % and 17.7 %, respectively. All the results indicated that PGM
was a sensitive and potable method and could be widely used for acute
biotoxicity assessment of heavy metals in sewage sludge.” by “Abstract:
As a simple and feasible method for acute biotoxicity assessment,
personal glucose meter (PGM) can be successfully applied in the early
warning of environmental pollutants in sewage. In this paper, the acute
biotoxicity of single and joint heavy metals in sewage and real sludge
samples was systematically described based on the glucose metabolism
of Escherichia coli (E. coli). Results indicated that the biotoxicity order of
five single heavy metals in sewage was Hg2+ > As3+ > Cu2+ > Zn2+ > Cd2+.
The joint heavy metals of Cu2++Zn2+, Cu2++Cd2+, and Cu2++Hg2+ produced
synergistic effects, while Cu2++As3+ and Cd2++Zn2+ possessed
antagonistic effects for the combined biotoxicity. In spiked sludge, Cd2+
and Zn2+ owned higher biotoxicity than Cu2+ and As3+. Notably, the
electroplate factory and housing estate sludge respectively showed the
highest and lowest inhibition rates as 57.4% and 17.7% under the real
sludge biotoxicity assessment. These results demonstrated that PGM was
a sensitive and potable method, which could be widely used for acute
biotoxicity assessment of heavy metals in sewage sludge”.
7. Many language expressions should be polished during the revision.
Please improve the language greatly.
Response: We have improved the language expressions in this paper by
an expert who can effectively write and expression in English. For
example, at the last paragraph of the “Discussion”, we have replaced “On
the whole results, it were successfully testified that heavy metal pollution
has higher inhibition on the microbial glucose metabolism in this study.
Based on the glucose consumption by E.coli acute biotoxicity assessment
can be consistent and accurate reflected by using PGM.” by “On the
whole results, it was successfully testified that heavy metal pollution had
higher inhibition on the microbial glucose metabolism in this study. Based
on the glucose consumption by E.coli, acute biotoxicity assessment can
be consistent and accurate reflected by using PGM.”.
8. I also recommend that authors add some newly references concerning
removal of heavy metals, such as Journal of Hazardous Materials 289
