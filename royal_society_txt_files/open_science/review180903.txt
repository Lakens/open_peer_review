This clever paper demonstrates what happens to complex phenotypes, specifically teeth, when
distantly related mammals hybridize. Its significance is that it focuses on a trait that is important
in the fossil record and that is well understood from functional and development perspectives.
The authors apply several state of the art methods, several of which they developed themselves:
analysis of four-fold degenerate sites from more than 4,000 genes to produce a robust estimate of
genetic distances between the hybrid species; geometric morphometrics and trigonometric
parameters to quantify the parent and offspring phenotypes; 3D scanning of phenotypes for
measuring and visualizing the results; and an interactive morphodynamic model of the cellular
level processes in tooth development to identify what signalling parameters are likely to explain
the differences between the parent species and the hybrid.
The authors capitalize on museum specimens of what was a putative hybrid seal (the veracity of
which they confirm with genomic analysis). Using the genetic distances they show that the
parent species of seal are more divergent than human and Neanderthals, the implication of which
is that the hybrid event they are studying could conceivably have happened between species in
the Genus Homo, which in turn implies that tooth phenotypes found in the hominin fossil record
could be hybrids. They then show that the hybrid seal is indeed a hybrid using genome analysis
of DNA extracted from the museum specimen and data from the two parent species. They then
examine the tooth (and cranial) phenotypes using morphometrics to show that the hybrid has an
intermediate morphology (see comment below about that) and use the morphodynamic
developmental model to suggest that the dental differences between the parent species and
between them and the hybrids are likely to be in the level of expression of one of the inhibitor
molecules involved in the gene cascade that produces the tooth crown pattern, which by analogy
to mouse models they suspect is SHH (sonic hedgehog).
The paper is appropriate for Open Science. With the exceptions described below, I find the paper
to be well analysed. I have paid especially close attention to the morphometric analyses, but I am
passingly familiar with the other kinds of analysis used in the paper. I have three minor
suggestions that I hope will improve the paper:
1. The idea of hybrid “bracketing” is not as fully developed as it might be given that the paper’s
title focuses on it. By bracketing, the authors appear to mean a phylogenetic framework for
assessing the morphological effects of hybridization between increasingly distantly related parent
species. The idea seems to be that very closely related species are so similar that hybrid teeth are
likely to be similar to both parents, but that distantly related parent species would start with teeth
that are visibly differentiated and therefore their hybrid offspring could have a third morphology
that could easily be confused for an intermediate species (e.g., a missing link in a lineage). One
would, in principle, be able to compare teeth whose hybrid status is unknown to the differences
observed in the bracket dataset to evaluate the probability that it is a hybrid. The authors use
genetic distances instead of phylogeny since the former are not only indicative of closeness of
relationship but they also provide a measure for how much the genomes have actually diverged.
This idea is similar in concept to the ones developed by Alan Wilson and colleagues (Wilson et
3
al., 1974; Prager and Wilson,1975) to calibrate the rates of genomic evolution and the possibility of
hybridizing or to one I developed for assessing how close the fit between upper and lower teeth
is likely to be (Polly et al., 2005).
The bracketing idea is partially developed in the first part of the manuscript, especially in the
comparison of genetic distances between Human-Neanderthal, Seal-Seal, Lion-Tiger, and
Donkey-Horse, but the authors never really return to it to discuss the implications for tooth
phenotypes between increasingly divergent taxa. In fact, they can’t really discuss those
implications because the only teeth that are analysed are the seal teeth. There are two solutions:
reducing the emphasis on bracketing, especially in the title or to add analyses of the teeth of
mules and ligers. I recommend the first. Instead of presenting the data as a “bracket” on
hybridization, instead focus on the fact that the seals are more divergent than the Homo species
therefore we might expect such hybrid events, and their resulting tooth phenotypes, in the
human fossil record. If this strategy is followed it would only require cosmetic changes to the
wording used in the paper.
2. The authors show that the hybrid phenotypes are generally intermediate between the
phenotypes of the parent species, but I wonder whether they are truly intermediate. It is not
uncommon for hybrids to have phenotypes that are not simply a linear intermediate between the
parents, something that is most obvious when multivariate traits are analysed. For example, in
hybridizing shrews, the cranium and mandibles of hybrid phenotypes are not simple
intermediates (Polly et al. 2013). This phenomenon can be caused by overdominance, epistasis, or
other non-additive effects that I would think would be more likely the more distant the parent
species are from one another. With univariate traits such as the tooth cusp angles measured in
this paper the effects may not be obvious, but in the multivariate cranial data it may be the case.
Quick inspection of the PC scores provided in the supplemental files suggests it. PC 1 and PC 2
show two long arcs for the sequence of juvenile to adult in the two parent species (probably PC 1
is dominantly the ontogenetic change and PC 2 the between species difference, but this is hard to
say for certain from Figure 3). The hybrid is definitely intermediate on those axes, but it is at one
extreme on PC 3. It is entirely possible that the third axis broadly describes the unique difference
of the hybrid from both parent species. Calculation of morphometric distances between the
juvenile means for the two parent species and between them and the hybrid specimen yields the
following numbers: Hal-Pusa=0.072, Hal-hybrid=0.053, Pusa-hybrid=0.041. Thus the total
distance between the hybrid and the two parents is greater than the distance directly between the
two parent species, which suggests that the hybrid doesn’t lie directly intermediate between the
parents. This isn’t a problem per se, because the authors’ logic only depends on the hybrid being
approximately intermediate. The only change needed is to add an explanatory caveat to the
places where the intermediate status is mentioned. This also means that the lovely animation of
the parent-hybrid trajectory in the supplemental files is only an approximation, but that’s
perfectly acceptable.
3. Hybridization between vertebrates that are classified in different genera is more common than
is implied in the introduction. Natural hybridization in fish is very common compared to
amniote taxa, probably because internal fertilization in the latter increases the number of
behavioral barriers. But hybrids between species classified in different genera is also fairly
common. That the seals are not an extreme exception should be mentioned in the text. Some
entry points into the relevant literature are Hubbs (1955), Schwartz (1972, 1981), Wilson et al.

This is a well-done study that addresses the interesting biological phenomena of interspecies
hybridization in mammals. The authors sequence a hybrid zoo seal specimen (along with both
parental species), carry out a morphological analysis of hybrid dentition, model how the
intermediate morphologies seen can best be generated by intermediate levels of developmental
parameters, and carry out additional sequencing that suggests that wild Baltic sea ringed seals
may carry some introgressed alleles from Baltic grey seals.
5
The manuscript adds significant new genomic and morphological data to the literature on
interspecific hybridization. The manuscript is written very clearly and does an excellent job of
framing the current results in a broader framework ranging from Neandertal-human
hybridization to hybridization between lions and tiger, and donkeys and horses.
I think that Figure 1 should be redrawn to more clearly emphasize the range of genetic distances
bracketed by the different examples of interspecific hybrids shown. Right now, the branch
lengths of the recent divergences between human-neandertal, seal-seal, lion-tiger, and donkey-
horse species are swamped by the longer branch lengths between the different distantly related
clades. In addition, simple swiveling of the carnivore clade would not change the overall
phylogenetic relationships, but would result in a visual order that more clearly displays how the
seals fit in the overall rank order of inter-specific divergence (Horse-donkey most diverged, then
lion-tiger, then seal-seal, then human-neandertal).
It would also be useful to comment on whether regions of the wild Baltic Sea ringed seal genome
that show evidence of introgression from grey seals may be enriched in particular biological
functions, and to further discuss how the extent of introgression in Baltic seals compares with
levels of introgression reported in previous studies of human, bear, and horse populations that
also appear to have been influenced by previous hybridization with divergent species.

Appendix A
Dear Editors,
Thank you very much for provisionally accepting our manuscript. We found the
referee comments very useful in revising the paper. We have uploaded a colour coded
version of the manuscript highlighting changes in response to referee comments as
also a 'clean' version of the text without the colour coding.
Both referees were enthusiastic about the study, but pointed out specific areas that
should be improved, detailed below.
Reviewer: 1 (we have highlighted the changes in the ms)
This clever paper demonstrates what happens to complex phenotypes, specifically
teeth, when distantly related mammals hybridize. Its significance is that it focuses on
a trait that is important in the fossil record and that is well understood from functional
and development perspectives. The authors apply several state of the art methods,
several of which they developed themselves: analysis of four-fold degenerate sites
from more than 4,000 genes to produce a robust estimate of genetic distances between
the hybrid species; geometric morphometrics and trigonometric parameters to
quantify the parent and offspring phenotypes; 3D scanning of phenotypes for
measuring and visualizing the results; and an interactive morphodynamic model of the
cellular level processes in tooth development to identify what signalling parameters
are likely to explain the differences between the parent species and the hybrid.
The authors capitalize on museum specimens of what was a putative hybrid seal (the
veracity of which they confirm with genomic analysis). Using the genetic distances
they show that the parent species of seal are more divergent than human and
Neanderthals, the implication of which is that the hybrid event they are studying
could conceivably have happened between species in the Genus Homo, which in turn
implies that tooth phenotypes found in the hominin fossil record could be hybrids.
They then show that the hybrid seal is indeed a hybrid using genome analysis of DNA
extracted from the museum specimen and data from the two parent species. They
then examine the tooth (and cranial) phenotypes using morphometrics to show that
the hybrid has an intermediate morphology (see comment below about that) and use
the morphodynamic developmental model to suggest that the dental differences
between the parent species and between them and the hybrids are likely to be in the
level of expression of one of the inhibitor molecules involved in the gene cascade that
produces the tooth crown pattern, which by analogy to mouse models they suspect is
SHH (sonic hedgehog).
The paper is appropriate for Open Science. With the exceptions described below, I
find the paper to be well analysed. I have paid especially close attention to the
morphometric analyses, but I am passingly familiar with the other kinds of analysis
used in the paper. I have three minor suggestions that I hope will improve the paper:
1. The idea of hybrid “bracketing” is not as fully developed as it might be given that
the paper’s title focuses on it. By bracketing, the authors appear to mean a
phylogenetic framework for assessing the morphological effects of hybridization
between increasingly distantly related parent species. The idea seems to be that very
closely related species are so similar that hybrid teeth are likely to be similar to both
parents, but that distantly related parent species would start with teeth that are visibly
differentiated and therefore their hybrid offspring could have a third morphology that
could easily be confused for an intermediate species (e.g., a missing link in a lineage).
One would, in principle, be able to compare teeth whose hybrid status is unknown to
the differences observed in the bracket dataset to evaluate the probability that it is a
hybrid. The authors use genetic distances instead of phylogeny since the former are
not only indicative of closeness of relationship but they also provide a measure for
how much the genomes have actually diverged. This idea is similar in concept to the
ones developed by Alan Wilson and colleagues (Wilson et al., 1974; Prager and
Wilson,1975) to calibrate the rates of genomic evolution and the possibility of
hybridizing or to one I developed for assessing how close the fit between upper and
lower teeth is likely to be (Polly et al., 2005).
The bracketing idea is partially developed in the first part of the manuscript,
especially in the comparison of genetic distances between Human-Neanderthal, Seal-
Seal, Lion-Tiger, and Donkey-Horse, but the authors never really return to it to
discuss the implications for tooth phenotypes between increasingly divergent taxa. In
fact, they can’t really discuss those implications because the only teeth that are
analysed are the seal teeth. There are two solutions: reducing the emphasis on
bracketing, especially in the title or to add analyses of the teeth of mules and ligers. I
recommend the first. Instead of presenting the data as a “bracket” on hybridization,
instead focus on the fact that the seals are more divergent than the Homo species
therefore we might expect such hybrid events, and their resulting tooth phenotypes, in
the human fossil record. If this strategy is followed it would only require cosmetic
changes to the wording used in the paper.
RESPONSE: This was indeed a shortcoming of the analyses, and to address this
issue we have examined the phenotypes further. Specifically, because the
distinctive aspect of the grey-ringed seal comparison is their disparate dentitions,
we now report cusp number disparities for the seals and other taxa studied.
Together with the genetic data, these analyses underscore the 'bracketing' aspect
of the study (lines 128-136, 269-272 in discussion). Also to address reviewer 2
comments on Figure 1, we revised the figure to show the genetic differences more
clearly, as also showing the dental disparaties (lines 657-667). We feel that this
figure and the dental disparity comparisons finally capture the scope and
significance of the study and the hybrid seal. The disparity tabulations are
detailed in the methods (lines 370-386) and the relevant data are in a new table
S7.
In reference to the concepts, we now cite these papers (Wilson, Prager..) in
conclusions (lines 242-244 and 255-258). These changes make the general and
dental contexts clearer.
2. The authors show that the hybrid phenotypes are generally intermediate
between the phenotypes of the parent species, but I wonder whether they are truly
intermediate. It is not uncommon for hybrids to have phenotypes that are not simply
a linear intermediate between the parents, something that is most obvious when
multivariate traits are analysed. For example, in hybridizing shrews, the cranium and
mandibles of hybrid phenotypes are not simple intermediates (Polly et al. 2013). This
phenomenon can be caused by overdominance, epistasis, or other non-additive effects
that I would think would be more likely the more distant the parent species are from
one another. With univariate traits such as the tooth cusp angles measured in this
paper the effects may not be obvious, but in the multivariate cranial data it may be the
case. Quick inspection of the PC scores provided in the supplemental files suggests
it. PC 1 and PC 2 show two long arcs for the sequence of juvenile to adult in the two
parent species (probably PC 1 is dominantly the ontogenetic change and PC 2 the
between species difference, but this is hard to say for certain from Figure 3). The
hybrid is definitely intermediate on those axes, but it is at one extreme on PC 3. It is
entirely possible that the third axis broadly describes the unique difference of the
hybrid from both parent species. Calculation of morphometric distances between the
juvenile means for the two parent species and between them and the hybrid specimen
yields the following numbers: Hal-Pusa=0.072, Hal-hybrid=0.053, Pusa-
hybrid=0.041. Thus the total distance between the hybrid and the two parents is
greater than the distance directly between the two parent species, which suggests that
the hybrid doesn’t lie directly intermediate between the parents. This isn’t a problem
per se, because the authors’ logic only depends on the hybrid being approximately
intermediate. The only change needed is to add an explanatory caveat to the places
where the intermediate status is mentioned. This also means that the lovely animation
of the parent-hybrid trajectory in the supplemental files is only an approximation, but
that’s perfectly acceptable.
RESPONSE: We now state this implicitly as requested (lines 210-211). One
limiting factor in the detailed inferences is that we do not have the actual parents
of the hybrid (also stated on lines 208-210).
3. Hybridization between vertebrates that are classified in different genera is
more common than is implied in the introduction. Natural hybridization in fish is
very common compared to amniote taxa, probably because internal fertilization in the
latter increases the number of behavioral barriers. But hybrids between species
classified in different genera is also fairly common. That the seals are not an extreme
exception should be mentioned in the text. Some entry points into the relevant
literature are Hubbs (1955), Schwartz (1972, 1981), Wilson et al. (1974) and Prager
and Wilson (1975).
RESPONSE: This is now mentioned (with references) in the beginning of the
conclusions (lines 242-243).
Reviewer: 2 (we have highlighted the changes in the ms)
This is a well-done study that addresses the interesting biological phenomena of
interspecies hybridization in mammals. The authors sequence a hybrid zoo seal
specimen (along with both parental species), carry out a morphological analysis of
hybrid dentition, model how the intermediate morphologies seen can best be
generated by intermediate levels of developmental parameters, and carry out
additional sequencing that suggests that wild Baltic sea ringed seals may carry some
introgressed alleles from Baltic grey seals.
The manuscript adds significant new genomic and morphological data to the literature
on interspecific hybridization. The manuscript is written very clearly and does an
excellent job of framing the current results in a broader framework ranging from
Neandertal-human hybridization to hybridization between lions and tiger, and
donkeys and horses.
I think that Figure 1 should be redrawn to more clearly emphasize the range of genetic
distances bracketed by the different examples of interspecific hybrids shown. Right
now, the branch lengths of the recent divergences between human-neandertal, seal-
seal, lion-tiger, and donkey-horse species are swamped by the longer branch lengths
between the different distantly related clades. In addition, simple swiveling of the
carnivore clade would not change the overall phylogenetic relationships, but would
result in a visual order that more clearly displays how the seals fit in the overall rank
order of inter-specific divergence (Horse-donkey most diverged, then lion-tiger, then
seal-seal, then human-neandertal).
RESPONSE: We have rearranged the Figure 1 as requested (lines 657-667). To
address referee 1 comments, we now include dental disparity values, and they
are shown in the same figure. Together these changes make the point and
significance of the hybrid much clearer.
It would also be useful to comment on whether regions of the wild Baltic Sea ringed
seal genome that show evidence of introgression from grey seals may be enriched in
particular biological functions, and to further discuss how the extent of introgression
in Baltic seals compares with levels of introgression reported in previous studies of
human, bear, and horse populations that also appear to have been influenced by
previous hybridization with divergent species.
RESPONSE: These are both important questions but unfortunately cannot be
addressed with our existing data because current analyses are based on sequence
data mapped to the Weddell seal genome and, due to relatively low sequencing
coverage, performed using genotype likelihoods. We are in the process of
assembling a reference genome that will enable detailed study of the
introgression, and with additional data from a second grey seal population one
can address questions about gene flow (e.g. using the D Foil method). We now
state the needed direction of future studies in the conclusions (lines 258-259).
We thank again the referees for their comments and look forward to hearing from you.
