be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.

Response to the reviewers
Reviewer: 1
1.In the end of introduction : no clear goal of the paper. It is rather scope. So it is
advised to change the construction of the sentences.
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. According to the comment, the construction of
the sentences in the end of introduction has been changed. The goal of the paper has
been illustrated as follows: We believe that the results will benefit the fundamental
understanding of the wear behavior of thermoplastic polymers, providing theoretical
and technical guidance for the design, material selection and protection of friction
components serving in deep sea.
2. Why only 10 % compositions were tested?
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. CF/PEEK composites with different fiber
volume fraction have been studied and reported in our previous work (Chen B, Wang
J, Yan F. Tribol Int, 2012, 52, 170).
In section 2.3, page 6, a sentence of “A carbon fiber of 10% was chosen due to
its optimum balance between stiffness, toughness, thermal stability, and more
importantly, the tribological performance in seawater[17]” has been added to describe
the reason why only 10% CF/PEEK composite was tested.
3. How was measured hydrostatic pressure-it should be added, what kind of
device…? How was it simulated?
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. According to the comment, in section 2.4, page
6, the sentences “Hydrostatic pressure was controlled by manually operated high
pressure control valves, which are supplied with the valve panel assembly. Two are
provided to be used with the inlet and outlet ports. The hydrostatic pressure was
measured by a pressure gauge, which is attached to the top of the pressure vessel. The
value of hydrostatic pressure was recorded by a pressure transducer. The pressure
transducer output is 4~20 mA” have been added.
4. Give the code of balance
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. According to the comment, in section 2.4, page
7, the sentence “Then the wear mass loss of the pin was measured using an electronic
balance with an accuracy of 0.1 mg” has been revised to “Then the wear mass loss of
the pin was measured using an electronic balance with an accuracy of 0.1 mg (Ohaus,
AdventureTM No. 121240520)”.
5. It was mentioned that the temp. of sample drying was room temp. Please give
more precisely, as different lab. Have different temp.
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. In section 2.6, page 9, the room temperature in
the laboratory has been added. The sentence “Mechanical properties measurements
were performed after the saturated samples had been fully dried at room temperature
to constant weights” has been revised to “Mechanical properties measurements were
performed after the saturated samples had been fully dried at room temperature to
constant weights (~25<U+2103>)”.
7. It would be valuable to add the crystallization temp. as general information
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. In section 2.3, page 6, the sentence “The
crystallization temperature of PEEK was reported to be 303.6<U+2103>[26]” has been added.
8. No methodology, device of morphological studies (Fig. 6). No data about the
roughness measurements- nowadays there are many instruments to measure it
and give the statistical data.
Response: Thanks for the good suggestion. According to the comment, section 2.7 in
page 10 has been rewritten. After revision, the methodology and device of
morphological studies has been studied. The paragraph “The worn surfaces of
CF/PEEK and the counterpart 316 SS were observed by JEM-1200EX scanning
electron microscope (SEM). In order to increase the resolution of SEM observations,
the worn surfaces were plated with gold coating to render them electrically conductive”
has been revised to “In order to research how the worn surface morphology of
CF/PEEK and the counterpart 316SS changes in different hydrostatic pressure, SEM
analysis was conducted by a JEM-1200EX scanning electron microscope (JEOL Ltd.,
Japan). The accelerating voltage for the SEM observations is 20 kV and the load
current is approximately 70 µA. Before observation, worn surface of the samples have
been coated with a thin film of gold by an auto fine coater (JFC-1600, JEOL Ltd.,
Japan). 3 samples worn in one specific hydrostatic pressure were utilized. For each
sample, 5 places on the surfaces of each sample were selected at random. SEM
micrograph was magnified to a magnification of 1000 for CF/PEEK and 500 for
316SS, and the characteristic morphology of worn surface has clearly been visible.”
There is no doubt that it is necessary and imperative to quantitatively evaluate
the surface roughness and give the statistical data. However, it is beyond the scope of
this paper. In fact, in our previous work, the worn surfaces of the CF/PEEK composite
lubricated by seawater had been examined by an atomic force microscopy (AFM)
with the lateral and vertical resolutions of 1 nm and 0.1 nm, respectively (Chen B,
Wang J, Yan F. Tribol Int, 2012, 52, 170). It is concluded that the surface roughness
of sliding CF/PEEK composite will increase with the increase of carbon fiber exposed
thereon.
Reviewer: 2
The work is application oriented. There are minor corrections.
1. In many places sentence begin with "And". Kindly avoid it.
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. We have carefully checked the whole paper,
and 6 modifications have been made to the phrases started by “And”. The word “And”
has been deleted directly. For instance, in section 2.6, page 9, the sentence “And the
mechanical properties of PEEK and its composites unaffected by seawater absorption
were also examined using the same methods” has been revised to “The mechanical
properties of PEEK and its composites unaffected by seawater absorption were also
examined using the same methods”.
2. In table 2 the constant a, b and c decrease with initial and saturated state for
the PEEK and composites. Can any reason be proposed for this decreasing
trend.
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. The physical interpretation of the constants, a,
b and c is not clear yet. According to the comment, we will pay more attention in the
follow-up study. To determine the exact reason of this decreasing trend, the specimens
in intermediate states with different seawater absorption amount between the dry state
and the saturated state will be tested.
3. Why only water connected to macromolecules by hydrogen bond cause change
in properties? Why not other absorbed water molecules cause this change?
Response: Thanks for the suggestion. It is well studied that the absorbed water
usually exists in two states within the polymer, which can be defined as follows: free
water, which undergoes similar thermal phase transitions to that of bulk water;
freezable bound water, which interacts with the polymer chains due to hydrogen bond
(Hodge R M, Polymer, 1996, 37, 1371). The absorbed free water can also induce
property changes in polymers. For example, at RT and above, dry specimens are
stiffer than wet ones since water is considered to act as a softening agent (spacer
between chains) (Baschek G, Polymer, 1999, 40, 3433). However, when water is
desorbed, the toughness can recover. Therefore, it is better to use “irreversible
changes in properties” rather than “changes in properties”. In section 3.2, page 14, the
sentence “…previously indicated that only water connected to macromolecules by
hydrogen bonds can cause changes in properties of PEEK materials[33, 34]” has been
revised to “…previously indicated that only water connected to macromolecules by
hydrogen bonds can cause irreversible changes in properties of PEEK materials[33,
34]”.
