Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
Theses are very interesting data and potentially tell us a lot about an important topical problem.
However, I think the framing of the paper is very confused and needs a radical revision. There
are three major issues here. (1) there seems to be a muddle between (a) the case where humans
switch grooming type in order to increase network size (that’s why baboons only have small ego-
centric networks and small groups) and (b) the case where individuals come in two types (those
who opt for grooming style light and those who opt for heavy). Clarifying this would go a long
way to allowing this paper to have the impact it deserves. (2) The purpose of the simulations
isn’t entirely clear, and it is not obvious to me that they tell us anything more than what we learn
from the empirical data. If the simulations are to have any value, this needs to be made clear. (3) I
think the paper misses the crucial point that everything hinges around the size of network an
individual wants to create: in other words, there is a phase transition from heavy to light
grooming when network size exceeds a certain N. This is the essential claim being made here, but
no attempt is made to actually show that this is the case – OR, and this is much the most
potentially interesting finding, the size of network at which this transition occurs.
The English is in need of a major revision. At the moment, the writing makes the paper difficult
to read and almost impossible to follow.
p. 2, l. 25-26: presumably this relationship (C=Nma) holds because C (the gross cost) is constant
across individuals? Another way of looking at this is that C represents the available social
capital an individual has (whether measured as emotional investment or time) (see Dunbar 2017).
If this is fixed for all individuals, it can be distributed thinly among many alters, or thickly among
a few alters.
P. 2, l. 36: Throughout the MS, the plural is used (“We aim to….” etc). Since there is only one
author, it is better to use the singular (“I aim to….” etc). Please change throughout.
P. 2, l. 41ff: if these represent two qualitatively different types of social grooming (weak vs
strong), should it not be the case that there is a switch point (phase transition) at which
individuals shift from using one to using the other? If so, it would be interesting to know at what
network size this switch occurs. Does this transition occur between individuals who have large
networks treat ALL their alters differently to the way people with small networks do (ie there is a
complete switch) OR because those with large networks treat SOME of their alters this way? In
other words, everyone with network size 1 to M use grooming method 1, and everyone with
network size M to N uses method 2; OR everyone uses method 1 for the first M alters in their
network and then method 2 for the remainder (N-M) IF they have a larger network.
P. 3, l. 58ff: it is true that SNS and email have appeared only recently, but these have not
increased the size of people’s networks as such (e.g. Pollet et al. 2011a; Dunbar 2016; see also
http:// blog.stephenwolfram.com/2013/04/ data-science-of-the-facebook-world/). Rather they
seem to have reduced the costs of maintenance, or even just replaced other forms of weak
relationship maintenance that humans already had (e.g. group singing, or storytelling). So the
only difference is simply the relaxation on the normal time/distance constraints.
3
P. 3, l.68: “dij was the days on which i did social grooming to individual j” is ambiguous. Is this
the total number of days?
P. 3, l.94: “inversely with the strength of their relationships”?
P. 3, l.96-98 (Fig. 2 and Table 1): but some of the datasets where a<1 are modern (SMS, phone) not
ancient! It is surely odd that the three phone samples should be differ in the way they do? One
explanation might be that this is just statistical variation around a=0; another might be that the
network sample sizes differ. I think you need to tell us what the average network sizes are for all
these samples, and then ask whether weak and strong grooming is determined by network size
(cf. Roberts et al. 2009).
P. 3, l. 87-88. As the graphs are given the other way around, it would be better to have a-g first
and h-m second (OR reverse order of the graphs in Fig 2).
P. 5, l. 137ff: the description of the model is so opaque that I cant figure out what’s being done
(despite being a modeller). Indeed, it is not entirely clear to me what these simulations are telling
us that we don't already know from the data. This needs clarifying.
P. 5, l. 154 and 180: since these are simulation experiments and not experiments with real people,
it might be better to label these as “Simulation experiment 1” and “Simulation experiment 2” (or
just plain “Simulation 1”) in order to avoid confusing readers, many of whom will not be
computer scientists (and hence will find the use of the term “experiment” here confusing).
P. 5, l. 166: what is a “relationship form (dij)”?
P. 6, l. 194 and Fig. 8: the switch in parameter a is known from Fig 1, isn’t it? So that isn’t such a
novel finding (given that the simulation is constrained by the observed data)? The real issue here
is surely where this occurs in respect of N (individual’s number of alters).
P. 6, l. 195-6: The sentence starts “Because….” but there is no main clause to follow. Such a
sentence should read “Because X is the case, so we do/find/suppose Y”.
P. 7, l. 230-250: (1) Care needs to be taken here. Humans and baboons have structured networks
with both weak and strong ties (network layers). It is not that humans have weak ties and
monkeys only have strong ties. It is true that human networks have more layers than monkey
networks, but this is simply a matter of degree, not a qualitative difference. (2) That said, there is
a genuine distinction (in the human data, at least) between those who characteristically have few,
deep relationships and those who have many weak ones (Pollet et al. 2011b; Roberts et al. 2009);
we normally distinguish these people as introverts and extraverts.
Fig. 5: can you clarify exactly what is meant by the Y-axis label: is this individual I’s total
grooming to ALL alters, or total grooming to an individual alter (or the average alter). Does
summed grooming to all alters increase with number of alters – OR is there a limit on the
summed amount of grooming that an individual can do? In other words, is the reason that some
individuals opt for weak grooming a consequence of the fact that they want to have a larger
network, when summed grooming is fixed? This is an important point to establish, because it
bears on the question of whether there is a limit of social capital (or time), as suggested by
Roberts et al. (2009) and Miritello et al. (2013). Again, this brings us back to the question as to
whether it is network size that drives this – thereby explaining why baboons only have small
groups (they don't have the capacity to use light grooming to create extra relationships in the way
humans do).

ESM1 (Data): (1) The data are not accessible via the ESM. This is partly because there are no
sources given in ESM1 (studies are referenced, but there is not list of references). By the way,
there is no particular reason for using Vancouver style (i.e. numbered) referencing in ESM: it is
MUCH easier for everyone if you use name+date format in the ESM. (2) What we would really
like to know is the average+variance number of alters per subject. I have no idea what min, max
and the %iles refer to, and I suspect they aren’t very interesting for us.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In the manuscript (RSOS-180148), the author studies a model of social relationship “social
grooming” by data analyses and numerical simulations. The author has investigated 13 datasets
of social grooming and tried classifying social grooming into two types, called “elaborate” and
“lightweight,” by using a trade-off model of the number and strength of social relationships on
social grooming.
The results are interesting and important in the on-going extensive interdisciplinary efforts to
understand the evolution of human social relationships. To my knowledge, little is known about
the exact role of cost constraints in the evolving social grooming. Therefore, the author’s data-
driven approach could have lots of implications for not only specialists but also broad readership
of Royal Society Open Science.
There are however some issues I feel the author need to address to improve the manuscript.
These are listed in what follows. The main issues to concern about are the accessibility to datasets
and the reuse of previous results, as in (i) and (ii) included below.
(i) Datasets are not accessible. It would be required to provide more detailed information
regarding the 13 datasets. The author introduces some proper names of the datasets, such as “755
group chat,” “Ameba Pigg,” and “Pachur” in the first paragraph of page 3, without providing
any support information and link to general repositories. In addition, the author frequently cites
ESM (p2 line 6, p4 line 64, p5 lines 108, 120, 127, p6 line 135, p8 line 254, and p16 Fig3 caption),
which yet I could not find it in the submission package.
(ii) Some results of data analyses and experiments, reported, seem to have been published in ref.
[9] (see the attached: M. Takano and I. Fukuda, Limitations of time resources in human
relationships determine social structures. Palgrave Communications 3, 17014 (2017),
doi:10.1057/palcomms.2017.14). To my knowledge, in ref. [9] the author has already published
the results for a > 1 (as in Table 1 and Figs. 2, 3, 4, 7, 8), with the same data analysis and
individual-based simulations. That is, one of the two types of social grooming methods based on
the trade-off has been found in ref. [9]. Therefore, the statement “In this paper, we show that two
types of social grooming (…) were discovered in a model constructed by thirteen communication
data-sets …” could be misleading. It would be strongly recommended for the author to more
clarify what the main results are and to more explain its background: what issues have been
solved/unsolved by previous literatures, such as ref. [9].
I would also have the following minor comments to add:
+ In p4, line 106. The author provides function G in Eq. (1), which describes the total amount of
social grooming. To me, it is not easy to understand the right hand side of the equation. It would
be helpful also to the general audience to add a few sentences that explain how to derive the
equation.
+ In Fig. 5 and Fig. 9. Fig. 5 and the panel (d) in Fig. 9 look same. If so, it would be desirable for
the author to merge the two figures into one.
Some typos etc.:
+ In Fig. 6, line 178. It reads “The difference between … may have been because of the
approximations of this model did not work with small a.” In which should “because of” be
“because”?
+ In Fig. 9, axis label of panel (c). Should “Sodial Grooming” be “Social Grooming”?

Theses are very interesting data and potentially tell us a lot about an important topical problem.
However, I think the framing of the paper is very confused and needs a radical revision. There

P. 5, l. 154 and 180: since these are simulation experiments and not experiments with real people,
it might be better to label these as “Simulation experiment 1” and “Simulation experiment 2” (or
just plain “Simulation 1”) in order to avoid confusing readers, many of whom will not be
computer scientists (and hence will find the use of the term “experiment” here confusing).
P. 5, l. 166: what is a “relationship form (dij)”?
P. 6, l. 194 and Fig. 8: the switch in parameter a is known from Fig 1, isn’t it? So that isn’t such a
novel finding (given that the simulation is constrained by the observed data)? The real issue here
is surely where this occurs in respect of N (individual’s number of alters).
P. 6, l. 195-6: The sentence starts “Because….” but there is no main clause to follow. Such a

P. 7, l. 230-250: (1) Care needs to be taken here. Humans and baboons have structured networks
with both weak and strong ties (network layers). It is not that humans have weak ties and

In the manuscript (RSOS-180148), the author studies a model of social relationship “social
grooming” by data analyses and numerical simulations. The author has investigated 13 datasets
of social grooming and tried classifying social grooming into two types, called “elaborate” and

The results are interesting and important in the on-going extensive interdisciplinary efforts to

(ii) Some results of data analyses and experiments, reported, seem to have been published in ref.
[9] (see the attached: M. Takano and I. Fukuda, Limitations of time resources in human
relationships determine social structures. Palgrave Communications 3, 17014 (2017),
doi:10.1057/palcomms.2017.14). To my knowledge, in ref. [9] the author has already published
the results for a &gt; 1 (as in Table 1 and Figs. 2, 3, 4, 7, 8), with the same data analysis and
individual-based simulations. That is, one of the two types of social grooming methods based on
the trade-off has been found in ref. [9]. Therefore, the statement “In this paper, we show that two

clarify what the main results are and to more explain its background: what issues have been
solved/unsolved by previous literatures, such as ref. [9].
I would also have the following minor comments to add:
+ In p4, line 106. The author provides function G in Eq. (1), which describes the total amount of
social grooming. To me, it is not easy to understand the right hand side of the equation. It would
be helpful also to the general audience to add a few sentences that explain how to derive the
equation.
+ In Fig. 5 and Fig. 9. Fig. 5 and the panel (d) in Fig. 9 look same. If so, it would be desirable for
the author to merge the two figures into one.
Some typos etc.:
+ In Fig. 6, line 178. It reads “The difference between … may have been because of the
approximations of this model did not work with small a.” In which should “because of” be
“because”?
+ In Fig. 9, axis label of panel (c). Should “Sodial Grooming” be “Social Grooming”?

Response for the First Reviewer
I would like to express my appreciation to the reviewer for his or her insightful
comments, which have helped me significantly improve the paper.
Comment 1
Theses are very interesting data and potentially tell us a lot about an important
topical problem. However, I think the framing of the paper is very confused and
needs a radical revision. There are three major issues here.
(1) there seems to be a muddle between (a) the case where humans switch
grooming type in order to increase network size (that’s why baboons only have
small ego-centric networks and small groups) and (b) the case where individuals
come in two types (those who opt for grooming style light and those who opt
for heavy). Clarifying this would go a long way to allowing this paper to have
the impact it deserves.
(2) The purpose of the simulations isn’t entirely clear, and it is not obvious
to me that they tell us anything more than what we learn from the empirical
data. If the simulations are to have any value, this needs to be made clear.
(3) I think the paper misses the crucial point that everything hinges around
the size of network an individual wants to create: in other words, there is a phase
transition from heavy to light grooming when network size exceeds a certain N.
This is the essential claim being made here, but no attempt is made to actually
show that this is the case – OR, and this is much the most potentially interesting
finding, the size of network at which this transition occurs.
Response 1
Thank you for your positive evaluation of my findings.
(1) I have discussed (a) and (b), respectively, according to the following com-
ments for clarification. For (a), I have added details as responses to comment
5, 9, 14, 16 (1), and 17. For (b), I have added details as a response to comment
16 (2).
(2) I have explained the purpose and results of the simulation experiments.
Please see the response to comment 11.
(3) I have discussed why a had a threshold for individuals’ social grooming
behaviour and social relationship forms (including network size). Please see the
response to comment 5, 6, 9, 15, 16, and 17.
Comment 2
The English is in need of a major revision. At the moment, the writing makes
the paper difficult to read and almost impossible to follow.
Response 2
The manuscript has been carefully reviewed by an experienced editor whose first
language is English and who specializes in editing papers written by scientists
whose native language is not English.
Comment 3
p. 2, l. 25-26: presumably this relationship (C = N ma ) holds because C (the
gross cost) is constant across individuals? Another way of looking at this is that
C represents the available social capital an individual has (whether measured
as emotional investment or time) (see Dunbar (2018)). If this is fixed for all
individuals, it can be distributed thinly among many alters, or thickly among a
few alters.
Response 3
There was diversity on C, not constant across individuals. I agree that C
represents the available social capital. Therefore, the previous work (Takano
and Fukuda, 2017) and this paper entered ub (C) to the regression C = N ma
(log N ~ N ormal(-a log m + b log u, s)) as a covariate to control the usage
frequency of social grooming methods.
In accordance with this comment, I have described the diversity of C in the
Introduction section (L. 26). I have added the reason of ub in this regression to
the Data Analysis section (L. 85, 92). I have added the distributions of C of
each social grooming method as Fig. 3.
Comment 4
P. 2, l. 36: Throughout the MS, the plural is used (“We aim to….” etc). Since
there is only one author, it is better to use the singular (“I aim to….” etc).
Please change throughout.
Response 4
In accordance with this comment, I have modified the first person.
Comment 5
P. 2, l. 41ff: if these represent two qualitatively different types of social grooming
(weak vs strong), should it not be the case that there is a switch point (phase
transition) at which individuals shift from using one to using the other? If so,
it would be interesting to know at what network size this switch occurs. Does
this transition occur between individuals who have large networks treat ALL
their alters differently to the way people with small networks do (ie there is a
complete switch) OR because those with large networks treat SOME of their
alters this way? In other words, everyone with network size 1 to M use grooming
method 1, and everyone with network size M to N uses method 2; OR everyone
uses method 1 for the first M alters in their network and then method 2 for the
remainder (N-M) IF they have a larger network.
Response 5
I think that humans with large networks use both social grooming types. A typ-
ical person who has various strengths of social relationships, which have several
hierarchies (Zhou et al., 2005; Dunbar, 2018), uses elaborate social grooming
(a < 1) for constructing a few close relationships and lightweight social groom-
ing for having many weak social relationships. This is caused by the change of
the peak of the function G around threshold a = 1.
The number of social relationships (network size) for each social grooming
method did not show clear relationships to a. This seemed to be caused by the
problem of data gathering for evaluating the number of social relationships. Ad-
ditionally, the number of social relationships which were smaller than the general
number (about 150 (Pollet et al., 2011a; Dunbar, 2016)) supports this problem.
There may be not a clear difference in the number of social relationships among
the data-sets because the previous studies (Pollet et al., 2011a; Dunbar, 2016)
showed that the number of social relationships did not particularly depend on
social grooming methods.
On the other hand, I think that a switch point at which individuals shift
from using one to using both types of social grooming may be due to the number
of very weak social relationships an individual wants to create. First, I describe
the data analysis of the relationship between a and social relationship forms.
Next, I state the individual-based simulations for finding a threshold on a for
social relationship forms.
a affected the ratio of very weak social relationships. Fig. 7 shows the size ra-
tio between neighboring hierarchies of social relationships, i.e. Hk /Hk+1 , where
Hk is the number of social relationships when social relationship strength d = k.
These ratios increased with a when k = 1 and 2. In contrast, there were no
correlations between the ratio and a when k = 3. That is, the trade-off param-
eter a only affected Hk /Hk+1 when k was small. In this analysis, a threshold
on a was not observed on social relationship forms due to the insufficiency of
the number of data-sets.
I conducted individual-based simulations to analyze changes of social rela-
tionship forms depending on a under the same conditions. These simulations
showed that the ratio between neighboring hierarchies of very weak social rela-
tionships H1 /H2 significantly changed around a = 0.8 (Fig. 11), where Hk is
the number of social relationships when d > k, i.e. H1 includes all social rela-
tionships excluding relationships of d = 1 (one time interactions). On the other
hand, Hk /Hk+1 on k = 2 gradually increased with a. This was due to the fact
that H1 increased with the increase of a and Hk when k = 2 decreased with the
increase of a (Fig. 12). Thus, very weak social relationship forms were especially
affected by trade-off parameter a compared with strong social relationships.
I have added that people tend to use both types of social grooming methods
to construct various strengths of social relationships to the Introduction section
(L. 53). I have discussed that people have various social relationships which
have several hierarchies (Zhou et al., 2005; Dunbar, 2018) in the Introduction
section (L.36). I have added the relationships between the number of social
relationships and a to the Data Analysis section (L. 144) and Fig. 6. I have
added the analysis of the ratio of very weak social relationships and a to the
Data Analysis section (L. 153) and Fig. 7. I have added the discussion of the
above results of individual-based simulations to the Simulation Experiment 2
section (L. 278), Fig. 11, and Fig. 12. I have discussed the way of usage of both
social grooming methods based on the function G in the Discussion section
(L. 328). I have discussed the switch point on social grooming methods and the
ratio of very weak social relationships in the Discussion section (L. 342).
Comment 6
P. 3, l. 58ff: it is true that SNS and email have appeared only recently, but
these have not increased the size of people’s networks as such (e.g. Pollet et al.
(2011a); Dunbar (2016); see also http:// blog.stephenwolfram.com/2013/04/
data-science-of-the-facebook-world/). Rather they seem to have reduced the
costs of maintenance, or even just replaced other forms of weak relationship
maintenance that humans already had (e.g. group singing, or storytelling).
So the only difference is simply the relaxation on the normal time/distance
constraints.
Response 6
As you pointed out, the previous works (e.g. Pollet et al. (2011a); Dunbar
(2016); http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2013/04/data-science-of-the-facebook-world/)
showed that online social grooming has not increased the number of social re-
lationships. This is important for discussing the effects of lightweight social
grooming. I have added this discussion to the Data Analysis section (L. 144).
Comment 7
P. 3, l.68: “dij was the days on which i did social grooming to individual j” is
ambiguous. Is this the total number of days?
Response 7
In accordance with the reviewer’s comment, I have changed this to “dij was the
total number of the days on which i did social grooming to individual j” (the
Data Analysis section L. 84)
Comment 8
P. 3, l.94: “inversely with the strength of their relationships”?
Response 8
This sentence was described with the intention that people invested more time
in their closer social relationships, i.e. Fig. 4 and 5. I have changed this sentence
to remove ambiguity (the Data Analysis section L. 111).
Comment 9
P. 3, l.96-98 (Fig. 2 and Table 1): but some of the datasets where a<1 are
modern (SMS, phone) not ancient! It is surely odd that the three phone samples
should be differ in the way they do? One explanation might be that this is just
statistical variation around a=0; another might be that the network sample
sizes differ. I think you need to tell us what the average network sizes are for all
these samples, and then ask whether weak and strong grooming is determined
by network size (cf. Roberts et al. (2009)).
Response 9
As you pointed out, some online (modern) social grooming methods (Mobile
phone (friends & family), SMS (friends & family), and Phone (Pachur)) were
a < 1. a of “Mobile phone (friends & family)” and “Phone (Pachur)” were
not significant with level of significance p = 0.05 (Table 1), i.e. they may have
statistical variation around a = 0.
The number of social relationships for each social grooming method did not
show clear relationships to a (Fig. 6; see also Response 5 for details). This
seemed to be caused by the differences in data gathering on the data-sets. This
could be possible by comparing diverse communication data-sets which are gath-
ered by similar methods.
a affected the ratio of very weak social relationships (Fig. 7; see also the
Response 5). This suggests that online social grooming methods in a < 1
might have been used for constructing non-weak social relationships. This was
caused by the following. The subjects of “Mobile phone (friends & family)” and
“SMS (friends & family)” were members of a young family living in a residential
community which was constructed of kin and neighbors. “Phone (Pachur)” was
used more for communication closer relationships than E-mails when people use
phone and E-mails (ESM Fig. 1).
I have shown the relationship between a and the number of social relation-
ships in the Data Analysis section (L. 144) and Fig. 6. Additionally, I have
added the analysis of a and the ratio of very weak social relationships to the
Data Analysis section (L. 153) and Fig. 7. I have discussed a and social relation-
ship forms (especially very weak social relationships) in the Discussion section
(L. 342, 353).
Comment 10
P. 3, l. 87-88. As the graphs are given the other way around, it would be better
to have a-g first and h-m second (OR reverse order of the graphs in Fig 2).
Response 10
In accordance with this comment, I have reversed them.
Comment 11
P. 5, l. 137ff: the description of the model is so opaque that I cant figure out
what’s being done (despite being a modeller). Indeed, it is not entirely clear to
me what these simulations are telling us that we don’t already know from the
data. This needs clarifying.
Response 11
In accordance with this comment, I have revised to clarify the explanation of
my model and the results as the following. I have added 1) the motivation of the
simulation experiments followed by data analysis (the Model section L. 163), 2)
the explanation for clarifying my model and results (the Model section L. 171,
175, 187, 191, 192, 199 and the Simulation Experiment 2 section L .254), and
3) the paragraph titles for the two-step processes of my model (Model L. 195,
204).
Comment 12
P. 5, l. 154 and 180: since these are simulation experiments and not experiments
with real people, it might be better to label these as “Simulation experiment 1”
and “Simulation experiment 2” (or just plain “Simulation 1”) in order to avoid
confusing readers, many of whom will not be computer scientists (and hence
will find the use of the term “experiment” here confusing).
Response 12
In accordance with this comment, I have changed section titles to “Simulation
Experiment 1 (2).” (L. 213, 234)
Comment 13
P. 5, l. 166: what is a “relationship form (dij)”?
Response 13
As you pointed out, this expression is ambiguous. I have changed this to “re-
lationship forms (distributions of dij )” (the Simulation Experiment 1 section
L. 225).
Comment 14
P. 6, l. 194 and Fig. 8: the switch in parameter a is known from Fig 1, isn’t it?
So that isn’t such a novel finding (given that the simulation is constrained by
the observed data)? The real issue here is surely where this occurs in respect of
N (individual’s number of alters).
Response 14
As you pointed out, I found the threshold a = 1 for individuals’ social behaviour
(function G) in the Data Analysis section. In contrast, a threshold was not ob-
served on social relationship forms due to the insufficiency of the number of
the data-sets (Fig. 7; see Response 5 for details). In simulation experiments,
I conducted individual-based simulations to analyze the changes of social rela-
tionship forms depending on a under the same conditions. As a result, I have
found the switch in parameter a may be due to the number of very weak social
relationships an individual wants to create (H1 /H2 ), not N .
I have explained this purpose of the individual-based simulations in the
Model section (L. 163). I have added data analysis and simulation experiments
for the number of social relationships to the Data Analysis section L. 153 and
the Simulation Experiment 2 section L. 278 (see also Response 5).
Comment 15
P. 6, l. 195-6: The sentence starts “Because….” but there is no main clause to fol-
low. Such a sentence should read “Because X is the case, so we do/find/suppose
Y”.
Response 15
In accordance with this comment, I have revised this sentence to explain the
causes of the previous sentence (the Simulation Experiment 2 section L. 260).
Comment 16
P. 7, l. 230-250: (1) Care needs to be taken here. Humans and baboons have
structured networks with both weak and strong ties (network layers). It is not
that humans have weak ties and monkeys only have strong ties. It is true that
human networks have more layers than monkey networks, but this is simply a
matter of degree, not a qualitative difference. (2) That said, there is a genuine
distinction (in the human data, at least) between those who characteristically
have few, deep relationships and those who have many weak ones (Pollet et al.,
2011b; Roberts et al., 2009); we normally distinguish these people as introverts
and extroverts.
Response 16
(1) According to this comment, I have added the following discussion to the
Discussion section (L. 317). As you pointed out, there may not have been a
qualitative difference of social relationship forms between (primitive) humans
and baboons because constructing methods for the forms (social grooming meth-
ods) were the same, i.e. elaborate social grooming. I have showed the minor
changes of elaborate social grooming did not reveal the qualitative changes of
social relationship forms (Fig. 11). On the other hand, the changes from elab-
orate methods to lightweight methods revealed the qualitative changes of the
forms.
(2) According to this comment, I have added the following discussion to the
Discussion section (L. 389). As you pointed out, there are differences of human
characteristics between introverts and extroverts. This difference is important
to discuss social grooming and social relationship forms.
The diversity of C on each social grooming method may reflect the difference
(Fig. 6; see also Response 3). That is, extroverts tended to use lightweight social
grooming for having many weak social relationships, in other words, their C of
lightweight methods may be higher than that of elaborate methods. In contrast,
introverts tended to use elaborate social grooming for having a few close social
relationships, in other words, their C of elaborate methods may be higher than
that of lightweight methods.
Comment 17
Fig. 5: can you clarify exactly what is meant by the Y-axis label: is this
individual I’s total grooming to ALL alters, or total grooming to an individual
alter (or the average alter). Does summed grooming to all alters increase with
number of alters – OR is there a limit on the summed amount of grooming
that an individual can do? In other words, is the reason that some individuals
opt for weak grooming a consequence of the fact that they want to have a
larger network, when summed grooming is fixed? This is an important point to
establish, because it bears on the question of whether there is a limit of social
capital (or time), as suggested by Roberts et al. (2009); Miritello et al. (2013).
Again, this brings us back to the question as to whether it is network size that
drives this – thereby explaining why baboons only have small groups (they don’t
have the capacity to use light grooming to create extra relationships in the way
humans do).
Response 17
The function G in Fig. 5 in my previous manuscript, which has been merged into
Fig. 13d for responding to reviewer 2’s comment 4 in my manuscript, represents
the total amount of social grooming to all relationships depending on sociality
trend m and trade-off parameter a of social grooming. That is, individuals’
total amount of social grooming are limited, and these limits (G(a, a; C, m))
depend on m and a. Thus, some individuals opt for lightweight social grooming
(a > 1) a consequence of the fact that they want to have a larger network
(small m and large N ), unlike baboons. In other words, two types of social
grooming have emerged as a consequence of social grooming strategies, which are
how individuals distribute their limited resources using several social grooming
methods depending on trade-off parameter a of the social grooming.
I have revised the expression of the caption of Fig. 13d (Fig. 5) as follows:
“the total amount of social grooming of each individual” to “the total amount
of social grooming to reinforce social relationships G of each individual.” I have
added the above discussion to the Discussion section (L. 333).
Comment 18
ESM1 (Data): (1) The data are not accessible via the ESM. This is partly
because there are no sources given in ESM1 (studies are referenced, but there
is not list of references). By the way, there is no particular reason for using
Vancouver style (i.e. numbered) referencing in ESM: it is MUCH easier for
everyone if you use name+date format in the ESM. (2) What we would really
like to know is the average+variance number of alters per subject. I have no idea
what min, max and the %iles refer to, and I suspect they aren’t very interesting
for us.
Response 18
(1) In accordance with this comment and the second reviewer’s comment 1,
I have added URLs of the data-sets as footnotes (the Data Analysis section
L. 66). In accordance with this comment, I have added references to the ESM
Section 1.
(2) In accordance with this comment, I have added the following data for the
distribution information: the distributions of individuals’ N to Fig. 6 and the
distributions of individuals’ C which is the summation of d about each individual
to Fig. 3. The quartiles of v for d of each relationship were shown in Fig. 4 and
5. The distributions of d were shown in Fig. 9.
Response for the Second Reviewer
I would like to express my appreciation to the Reviewer for his or her insightful
comments, which have helped me significantly improve the paper.
Comment 1
Datasets are not accessible. It would be required to provide more detailed
information regarding the 13 datasets. The author introduces some proper
names of the datasets, such as “755 group chat,” “Ameba Pigg,” and “Pachur”
in the first paragraph of page 3, without providing any support information and
link to general repositories. In addition, the author frequently cites ESM (p2
line 6, p4 line 64, p5 lines 108, 120, 127, p6 line 135, p8 line 254, and p16 Fig3
caption), which yet I could not find it in the submission package.
Response 1
In accordance with this comment, I have added URLs of the data-sets as foot-
notes (the Data Analysis section L. 66). I uploaded ESM files. Therefore, could
you ask the editors if you do not find these files? “ESM_Section1.pdf” has
described the details of all data-sets including proper names of the data-sets.
Comment 2
Some results of data analyses and experiments, reported, seem to have been pub-
lished in ref. [9] (see the attached: M. Takano and I. Fukuda, Limitations of time
resources in human relationships determine social structures. Palgrave Commu-
nications 3, 17014 (2017), doi:10.1057/palcomms.2017.14). To my knowledge,
in ref. [9] the author has already published the results for a > 1 (as in Table
1 and Figs. 2, 3, 4, 7, 8), with the same data analysis and individual-based
simulations. That is, one of the two types of social grooming methods based on
the trade-off has been found in ref. [9]. Therefore, the statement “In this paper,
we show that two types of social grooming (…) were discovered in a model con-
structed by thirteen communication data-sets …” could be misleading. It would
be strongly recommended for the author to more clarify what the main results
are and to more explain its background: what issues have been solved/unsolved
by previous literatures, such as ref. [9].
Response 2
As you pointed out, my explanation of the model was ambiguous. I extended
the model (Takano and Fukuda, 2017) for C = N ma from a > 1 to a > 0 by
introducing individuals’ total amount of social grooming G. G depending on
sociality trend m in social grooming methods has the threshold a = 1. As a
result, my model explains not only a = 1 but also 0 < a < 1.
In accordance with this comment, I have added this discussion to the Intro-
duction section (L. 48) and the Discussion section (L. 307). I have described
cited figures in Fig. 2, 4, 5, and ESM Fig. 2.
The following are Reviewer 2’s minor comments.
Comment 3
In p4, line 106. The author provides function G in Eq. (1), which describes the
total amount of social grooming. To me, it is not easy to understand the right
hand side of the equation. It would be helpful also to the general audience to
add a few sentences that explain how to derive the equation.
Response 3
In accordance with this comment, I have added how function G was developed
to the Data Analysis section (L. 127). Details of the development of the function
were in the ESM Section 2 (the Development of Eq. 1 Section).
Comment 4
In Fig. 5 and Fig. 9. Fig. 5 and the panel (d) in Fig. 9 look same. If so, it
would be desirable for the author to merge the two figures into one.
Response 4
In accordance with this comment, I have used Fig. 13d (Fig. 9 in the previous
manuscript) as Fig. 5 and have removed Fig. 5.
Comment 5
Some typos etc.:
• In Fig. 6, line 178. It reads “The difference between … may have been
