Manuscript describe mass spectrometric studies pertaining peptidomic analysis of potato
hydrolysate. I find several basic deficiencies in this manuscript.
1. Why potato is chosen as a model? Authors donot discuss literature available with the current
findings. It is therefore difficult to ascertain the exact aim of this study. At present the work
described just looks like routine method development for mass spectrometric analysis.
2. What was the status of potato tuber? Fresh tubers were used right after harvesting or
commercially available tubers were used. How can one quantify the effect of aging on the levels
of peptides and PTM in potato tubers?
3. Are there such studies available for any other vegetable or fruit? What is the significance of
PTM for nutritonal aspects of potato tubers? When author writes "their bitterness" are they
reffering to peptides or the potato?
At present, the manuscript is not clearly written, there is not specific aim for which this particular
study has been carried out. In the absence of the specific aim, the manuscript reads like technical
material in the present form. The work carried out has potential but the manuscript need major
revision before it can be accepted for publication.

The manuscript entitled "Peptidomics analysis of potato protein hydrolysates: Implications of
post-translational modifications in food peptide structure and behaviour" reports on the
application of shotgun peptidomic approach to study peptides and their PTM generated by a
simulated gastrointestinal digestion. The topic of this work is interesting since the modified
peptides are usually not studied in this type of articles.
The manuscript is well organized and written in English; nevertheless, some doubts should be
cleared before publication.
Introduction is a little bit long and scholastic: could be shortned but at the same time some
paragraphs about the importance of bioactive peptides should be added, because this concept is
completely neglected. For examples, authors are strongly recommended to add some recent
references about bioactive peptides in food matrices: Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry 2018
10.1007/s00216-018-0852-x and Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry 2016 10.1007/s00216-016-

Functional Foods 2016 10.1016/j.jff.2016.09.010, Journal of Functional Food
10.1016/j.jff.2018.02.022.
Page2 line 17: precipitation of the most abundant potato proteins, patatin, was performed at the
pH value corresponding to the pI of patatin. Patatin is for sure the major protein in potato, but we
are talking about less of 40%. Similar protocol has been used in Journal of Proteomics 119, pp. 21-
29 10.1016/j.jprot.2015.01.020, but this work was carried out on milk samples (where caseins
represent almost 80% of the protein mass).In the paper above mentioned, two precipitation
methods was compared (precipitated by organic solvent using cold acetone and precipitation of
the most abundant milk proteins, caseins) showing that the best protocol was still the protocol
employing an organic solvent for precipitate all proteins presented in the sample. Author should
discuss this point. Did they tested a precipitation with an organic solvents? Did they considered
this fact? The authors should compare their results with other paper in which precipitation of
more protocols were compared and the should justify their choice.
Furthermore it is interesting to add some information about real amount used: how many grams
of potato were extracted? 0.1 , 1 or more grams of potato? A quantification, by Bradford assay or
BCA assay was performed? After an extraction and precipitation step is always useful and
necessary quantify the total amount of extracted proteins.
Line20: why a portion was picked up?
Line 25: did authors do any replicates? And by the way it would be interesting to upload raw
files (and PEAKS ones) to a data repository (PRIDE for example).
Line 39: is not clear if authors were looking for some specific PTMs or they reported ones are the
only found.
Line50: to calculate peptide properties I would personally suggest to use Peptides package in R
https://github.com/dosorio/Peptides/
Page3 Line6: please add a Supporting File with a list of all identified proteins and peptides. It is
necessary anyway to add in the actual Sup File the columns with the parent protein and the
intensity in all the excel sheets.
Line 16: this part is very interesting, but It would be important to make some statistical analysis.
Table 2, 3 and 4 reports only some cases: do they represent the entire group? It would be better to
have some distribution of values (with histograms, boxplot or violinplot). The three tables can
also be merged since columns are mainly the same and they are small.
Line 30: many modifications can happen both in vivo and in vitro. Have authors checked in
Uniprot if they found already studied modification sites? By the way, Met oxidation is for sure a
possible modification in vivo, but it also comes quite often with high temperature. Since authors
heated to 90 °C samples for 15 minutes, is probable that the majority of this oxidations are heat
induced. To prove this point, it would be interesting and necessary repeat the experiment
without any heating but just by lowering pH with formic acid and directly inject in nanoLCMS.

Manuscript describe mass spectrometric studies pertaining peptidomic analysis of potato
hydrolysate. I find several basic deficiencies in this manuscript.
1. Why potato is chosen as a model? Authors donot discuss literature available with the
current findings. It is therefore difficult to ascertain the exact aim of this study. At present the
work described just looks like routine method development for mass spectrometric analysis.
Response: The aim of the present study was clearly stated in the introduction:
“In the present study, we further investigated, using shotgun
peptidomics workflow, the occurrence of a variety of specific PTMs in
amino acid residues of peptides generated during the processing of
potato proteins with gastrointestinal proteases, pepsin and pancreatin,
and discussed the influence of such PTMs of the peptide structural
properties and behaviour”.
The reason for choosing potato protein as a model is because we were studying
antioxidant peptides from digested potato proteins, and our recent study also showed
that the peptides can be modified by oxidation and deamidation (Rajendran RCK,
Mason B, Udenigwe CC. 2016 Peptidomics of peptic digest of selected potato tuber
proteins: post-translational modifications and limited cleavage specificity. J. Agric. Food
Chem. 64:2432-2437. doi: 10.1021/acs.jafc.6b00418).
Our study findings and conclusions are critical for those working on this topic to
understand the structure-function relationship, bioavailability, and physiological effects
of food-derived peptides.
2. What was the status of potato tuber? Fresh tubers were used right after harvesting or
commercially available tubers were used. How can one quantify the effect of aging on the
levels of peptides and PTM in potato tubers?
Response: We used commercially available potato tubers. The effect of aging on the
levels of peptides and PTMs was not the focus of the present study. Food proteins are
subjected to different types of conditions before being used to generate bioactive
peptides, and we are discussing the need to consider that the peptides may not all be in
their natural state. Therefore, our findings support our hypothesis and can inform
future studies on how to better handle the food protein sources to limit such
modifications, or how to explore the modifications further to derive beneficial effects
where applicable.
3. Are there such studies available for any other vegetable or fruit? What is the significance of
PTM for nutritional aspects of potato tubers? When author writes "their bitterness" are they
referring to peptides or the potato?
Response: There are several studies on PTM of proteins in the biological sciences,
especially related to their regulatory roles. However, there is a dearth of such studies for
food protein sources, vegetable or fruit. Currently, we do not know the significance of
the PTM on nutritional quality, as it is outside the scope of our study, but this is an
important question for future research. When we discussed bitterness, we were referring
to the property of food protein-derived peptides in general, not potato or potato
peptides. We hope that our revised document has provided clarification on the specific
purpose of this study and significance of our findings for food protein/peptide research.
4. At present, the manuscript is not clearly written, there is not specific aim for which this
particular study has been carried out. In the absence of the specific aim, the manuscript reads
like technical material in the present form. The work carried out has potential but the
manuscript need major revision before it can be accepted for publication.
Response: We appreciate the reviewer’s comments but would disagree on this issue. As
mentioned above, the specific aim was provided in both the original and revised
manuscript. This study is the first to identify several PTMs in food protein-derived
peptides, and to discuss the implications of such modification in altering the behavior
and bioactivity of the peptides. It is notable that these PTMs may have been formed
during enzymatic proteolysis that mimic the process in the digestive tract. This work is a
pioneer study in the field of food peptides, as noted to some degree by Reviewer 2.

1. Introduction is a little bit long and scholastic: could be shortned but at the same time some

is completely neglected. For examples, authors are strongly recommended to add some recent
references about bioactive peptides in food matrices: Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry

Journal of Functional Food 10.1016/j.jff.2018.02.022.
Response: Thank you for the suggestions. We are familiar with these important articles
and some of our group members have referred to them. However, the papers are review
articles on bioactive peptide analysis and, therefore, do not particularly address the
specific topic (PTM) of the current manuscript. After critically reading the suggested
articles, we decided not to include them and hope that the reviewer agrees with our
reason.
2. Page2 line 17: precipitation of the most abundant potato proteins, patatin, was performed at
the pH value corresponding to the pI of patatin. Patatin is for sure the major protein in potato,
but we are talking about less of 40%. Similar protocol has been used in Journal of Proteomics
119, pp. 21-29 10.1016/j.jprot.2015.01.020, but this work was carried out on milk samples

sample. Author should discuss this point. Did they tested a precipitation with an organic
solvents? Did they considered this fact? The authors should compare their results with other
paper in which precipitation of more protocols were compared and the should justify their
choice.
Response: The aim of the extraction step in this type of study with food proteins is
usually for subsequent enzymatic processing and use of the resulting peptide mixtures as
bioactive component of food. The peptides are subsequently tested in vitro or in vivo for
the relevant bioactivities. Hence, the precipitation of food proteins by isoelectric
precipitation is preferred as this is intended for use as food and organic solvents are
usually difficult to remove completely. Moreover, we are mimicking the steps usually
taken to produce food peptides, in order evaluate if they contribute to the formation of
PTM.
3. Furthermore it is interesting to add some information about real amount used: how many
grams of potato were extracted? 0.1, 1 or more grams of potato? A quantification, by Bradford
assay or BCA assay was performed? After an extraction and precipitation step is always
useful and necessary quantify the total amount of extracted proteins.
Response: Protein content was assayed by Lowry method. Extensive details on the
isolation and characterization of the protein, including SDS-PAGE profile, amino acid
composition, surface hydrophobicity, as well as the bioactivity of the hydrolysates, have
been published previously, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2015.11.004. We focused the
present study on only peptidomics to evaluate the occurrence of PTMs and their possible
effects on the peptide properties.
4. Line20: why a portion was picked up?
Response: We have revised the sentence for clarity.
5. Line 25: did authors do any replicates? And by the way it would be interesting to upload
raw files (and PEAKS ones) to a data repository (PRIDE for example).
Response: Thank you for the comment. We agree that replicates are critical for
quantitative peptidomics (or proteomics), which is beyond the scope of the present study.
We performed a parallel experiment using the same materials and same procedure,
except that the protease was pepsin, and also found numerous PTMs in the peptides (not
reported in the manuscript). We made an extensive supplemental Table (Supplemental
Table S1) containing all the supporting information useful for the present study, such as
peptide sequence, -10lgP, mass, length, molecular weight, m/z, PTM, Ascore (the
parameter evaluating the reliability of PTM location). A new version of the
Supplemental Table has been included in the revised manuscript. We hope that this is
useful to the readers in understanding our findings and further studying this topic.
6. Line 39: is not clear if authors were looking for some specific PTMs or they reported ones
are the only found.
Response: We were looking for the PTMs specified in the method section. We have
revised relevant parts of the manuscript for clarity.
7. Line50: to calculate peptide properties I would personally suggest to use Peptides package
in R https://github.com/dosorio/Peptides/
Response: Thank you for the suggestion. We use the Peptides package on R in our lab,
but we find that this software is not able to deal with modified peptides. It requires the
native amino acid residues as input. We will consider using the software when it is
capable of calculating the properties of modified peptides.
8. Page3 Line6: please add a Supporting File with a list of all identified proteins and peptides.
It is necessary anyway to add in the actual Sup File the columns with the parent protein and
the intensity in all the excel sheets.
Response: We have made an extensive supplemental Table (Supplemental Table 1)
containing all the supporting information useful for the present study, such as peptide
sequence, -10lgP, mass, length, molecular weight, m/z, PTM, Ascore (the parameter
evaluating the reliability of PTM location).
9. Line 16: this part is very interesting, but it would be important to make some statistical
analysis. Table 2, 3 and 4 reports only some cases: do they represent the entire group? It
would be better to have some distribution of values (with histograms, boxplot or violinplot).
The three tables can also be merged since columns are mainly the same and they are small.
Response: Thank you for the suggestions. We have combined Table 2, 3 and 4 into the
new version of Table 2. In the new Table 2, five typical peptides of each PTM were
presented. Further, we have calculated all the peptides modified by either pyro-Glu
(glutamine) or deamidation (Asn), which substantially altered both pI and
hydrophobicity, and the distribution of values (with histograms) are shown in the new
Figure 1.
10. Line 30: many modifications can happen both in vivo and in vitro. Have authors checked
in Uniprot if they found already studied modification sites? By the way, Met oxidation is for
sure a possible modification in vivo, but it also comes quite often with high temperature.
Since authors heated to 90 °C samples for 15 minutes, is probable that the majority of this
oxidations are heat induced. To prove this point, it would be interesting and necessary repeat
the experiment without any heating but just by lowering pH with formic acid and directly
inject in nanoLCMS.
Response: We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful opinion. Firstly, it is true that many
modifications could happen both in vivo and in vitro. Some of the PTMs may be formed
in vivo, which was mentioned in the manuscript. However, the main idea in the present
study was that in vitro conditions, including protein extraction and proteolytic
processes, might also be responsible for the formation of the various PTMs. The 15-
minute heating of samples was part of the in vitro condition, and hence it is reasonable
for the present study to use heating for termination enzymatic reactions. Studies on
approaches to identify the causes and ways of limiting the formation of peptide PTMs is
necessary, but this is outside the scope of the current manuscript.
11. Line 50: I see 7 acetyl Lys in table 1, not 6. Please, correct it.
Response: There were seven acetylated Lys sites in total, one of which was located at the
N-terminal of a peptide. We have now corrected this by mentioning six acetylated sites
for lysine in Table 1.
