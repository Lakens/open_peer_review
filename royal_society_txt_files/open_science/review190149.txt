The paper describes some experiments about the detection of the respiration rate in neonates
using an IR-UWB RADAR. The work is interesting, but I have sme comments to improve the
quality of the work:
1. More details about the IR-radar must be included in the text. The only reference to the radar is
the company that manufacture it (Xethru X4M06; Xandar Kardian, Delaware, USA).
2. In the formula of the movement M(t), the difference must be defined including an absolute
value of the difference abs(m(t)).
3. The signal processing described in fig.2 must be described better. For example, the interference
signal removal or vital sign extraction or noise reduction. The detection of RR must be described
better. For example, if a FFT is used, what is the time-window period used, the windows used or
if another algorithm is used (periodogram, ...).
In order to understand better the procedure, a new figure could be included showing a sample
raw signal and the signal after each step (interference reduction, noise reduction and Fourier
transform).
4. In order to understand the effect the movement, the Fourier transform for a period with and
without movement could be included. It is expected that the signal-to-noise ratios will be worst
during movements.
5. The proposed method have two main drawbacks: random movements of the body and the
orientation of the body. In the case of neonates the movement is small and the body falls in the
illumination area of the body, therefore it is expected that is not a big problem compared with
other applications, for example, a person walking. This drawback is studied in the work. The
radar detects changes in the chest movement. Therefore, the signal detected in the back or lateral
orientation is very small and the signal-to-noise ratio increases. In these situations, the error could
be high. Some tests with different orientations of the body with respect to the radar (in lateral
orientation or by back) should be included. A solution with two antennas is proposed in [18] to
solve the problem. Some additional comments should be included in the discussion about this
problem or potential solutions.The results given are only for the most favorable orientation. Some
additional results should be included for other body orientations.

Manuscript: Noncontact Respiration Monitoring Using Impulse
Radio Ultrawideband (IR-UWB) Radar in Neonates
P1L37 “Neonatal movements” -> Authors probably mean “neonatal voluntary movements“
instead of “neonatal chest movements”
P1 Please add information in the abstract about the respiratory status of the PICU neonates: e.g.
non-mechanically assisted spontaneous breathing neonates?
P1L39 The authors describe their finding as “excellent agreement” for M0 measurements. But
what do define as excellent, because the LOA are rather wide [-9.6–10.0] for a vital parameter
with normal values between 30-60 breaths per minute for a neonate.
P2L33 This should be considered as part of your results: “Six neonates were eligible for the
experiments among 42 full-term neonates (= 37 weeks of gestational age)” and is not a description
of the study plan.
P2L36 Why would you exclude neonates with “dyspnea, sustained tachypnea (RR > 60
breaths/min)”? These are the interesting ones, on P2L7 the authors describe that these devices are
seldom evaluated in actual clinical practices and I read this as that they are aiming to evaluate IR-
UWB in a clinical setting. A device should also perform well in abnormal clinical situations.
P2L40 Did the authors preplanned how long the experiment would take per neonate? Did the
authors predefine what they would consider acceptable limits of agreement?
P3L9 Is the averaging time also 10 seconds?
P3L14 I like the way the authors were able to define the extent of movement. I hope that the
authors can reassure us that this method does not classify a deep breath as an M1. After all,
motion of breathing is not constant, with regular changes between shallow breathing and deep
breaths.
P3L37 For this type of data, with repeated measurements for every participant, it is unusual and
misleading to present correlation coefficients. This very nicely explained by Bland and Altman.
They also wrote an article about methods comparison studies with multiple observations per
individual and how this data should be handled differently.
http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10543400701329422
P3L59 I agree with the authors that this breathing trace represents matched respiratory signals.
However, this does not explain why, even if only M0 measurements pairs are selected, there is
still some considerable spread around the bias (represented by the rather wide LOA), especially
at an average breathing rate of 40 breaths/minute. Have the authors looked into detail to these
traces to understand why there’s such a large discrepancy between the devices in other
measurements? Consider for example cardiac rhythm disturbances that interfere with IP signals?
4
If the authors suspect that a large proportion of the measurement error is due to “failure” of IP
measurements it would be worthwhile to look the editorial written by Myles in the Br J
Anaesthesia 2007.
P4L10 I would suggest removing the correlation coefficients from the paper and also the
correlation plots in Figure 4. Because correlation in this type of research is misleading.
P4L54 I am not fully convinced by the results that IR-UWB can accurately measure respiratory
rate in neonates. The bias measurement is excellent, however the LOA are rather wide also when
M1 an M2 measurements are removed. A 10 breaths/minute difference can be clinically relevant.
Personally, I am not so disturbed by artifacts due to voluntary movement, this indicates that the
neonate is active and thus alive. I would suggest that the authors think of clinical situations in
which the IR-UWB would detect breathing but the neonate is at risk of respiratory failure. E.g.
upper airway obstruction, or epileptic activity. These situations should be recognized and should
not produce falsely reassuring respiratory rate numbers.

Appendix A
Responses to the Reviewers’ Comments
We thank the editors for their constructive comments and critical review of the content. After
considerable thought and discussion, we have performed additional experiments, revised the
existing statistical errors, added some of our comments and edited the manuscript accordingly, as
detailed below.
Reviewer: 1
1. More details about the IR-radar must be included in the text. The only reference to the radar
is the company that manufacture it (Xethru X4M06; Xandar Kardian, Delaware, USA).
Thanks for your comment. The IR-UWB radar sensor is capable of detecting motions of an object
using the ultra-wideband without interference from other sensors and measuring the distance to
the objects. The radar module used has a center frequency of 7.29 GHz and a bandwidth of 1.5
GHz. it also uses a small power about -41.3dBm/MHz that meets Federal Communications
Commision (FCC) standards (A Lazaro et al, Sensors 2014;14:2595-2618). In addition, it is a sensor
suitable for extracting the vital signal of the patient in a non-contact method without giving any
influence to the patient's body with low power. Recently, there have been researches on heart rate
monitoring and arrhythmia detection using the same IR-UWB radar sensor (Y Lee et al, Scientific
reports 2018;8: 13053-13062). And we've applied IR-UWB radar sensors to extract the respiration
rate of the newborn.
As you comment, we have described more detail explanation regarding the IR-UWB radar sensors
that we used.
(page 3, section 3.4, 1st paragraph)
2. In the formula of the movement M(t), the difference must be defined including an absolute
value of the difference abs(m(t)).
Thank you for taking a closer look. The difference between the frame X(t,k) received from the radar
and the previous frame X(t-1,k), that is X(t,k)-X(t-1,k) is firstly taken as an absolute value and then
all the corresponding array components are added. We modified the formula correctly.
(page 3, section 3.5)
3. The signal processing described in fig.2 must be described better. For example, the
interference signal removal or vital sign extraction or noise reduction. The detection of RR
must be described better. For example, if a FFT is used, what is the time-window period used,
the windows used or if another algorithm is used (periodogram, ...).
In order to understand better the procedure, a new figure could be included showing a sample
raw signal and the signal after each step (interference reduction, noise reduction and Fourier
transform).
Thanks for your comment. In addition to radar signals received from the neonate, there are clutter
signals that are received by various objects. This is because the beamforming angle of the radar
antenna is wide and unwanted signals need to be removed. Background subtraction is a technique
for separating the foreground from the background, where walls of static objects correspond with
the background, while the neonate’s chest or abdomen corresponds with the foreground. With this
algorithm, background signals can be removed, and only the signal components of a respiration
signals can be detected. In addition, low-pass filtering corresponding to the respiratory frequency
band of the newborn has eliminated unwanted noise in the high frequency band. The time-window
period is 8 seconds and the FFT Size is 4096, sampling rate is 40. I will attach an additional figure
to understand the signal for each step.
In correspondence with your comment, we revised our manuscript and included a new figure (Figure
3) depicting the representative data from each step described in the block diagram. (RS Rakibe et
al, Int. J Sci Res Publ 2013;3:2250–3153)
(page 3, section 3.4, 2nd paragraph)
4. In order to understand the effect the movement, the Fourier transform for a period with
and without movement could be included. It is expected that the signal-to-noise ratios will
be worst during movements.
Thanks for your comment. Since the radar basically extracts the breathing signal based on the
movement of the abdomen of the newborn, the SNR of the signal drops when there is
movement. Therefore, it becomes difficult to extract an accurate breathing signal while moving. I
attach below breathing signals when there is movement and when there is no movement. For M0,
which has little movement in the following figure, it is easy to extract the corresponding
component in the frequency domain, whereas M1, M2, where movement exists, has a number of
candidate points that can be the respiratory rate in the respiratory frequency band. Therefore,
finding the correct respiration rate is ambiguous if movement exists.
<U+F0E0>
5. The proposed method have two main drawbacks: random movements of the body and the
orientation of the body. In the case of neonates the movement is small and the body falls in
the illumination area of the body, therefore it is expected that is not a big problem compared
with other applications, for example, a person walking. This drawback is studied in the work.
The radar detects changes in the chest movement. Therefore, the signal detected in the back
or lateral orientation is very small and the signal-to-noise ratio increases. In these situations,
the error could be high. Some tests with different orientations of the body with respect to the
radar (in lateral orientation or by back) should be included. A solution with two antennas is
proposed in [18] to solve the problem. Some additional comments should be included in the
discussion about this problem or potential solutions. The results given are only for the most
favorable orientation. Some additional results should be included for other body orientations.
Thanks for your comment. We also believe that SNR will vary depending on the orientation of
newborns. We have recently tried measurement in the supine position of newborns. Similar to those
tested in the prone orientation, the figure below shows that there is good correlation between radar
sensor and IP if there is no voluntary movement of the neonates in the back position. From a signal
processing point of view, the SNR in the prone orientation may be lower than the front orientation,
but there is no significant effect on detecting respiration rate. However, it is dangerous and
burdensome for a newborn to experiment for a long time in a prone position. Later, studies will be
conducted to detect the respiration rate in various positions in different ways. Moreover, the
proposal to conduct an experiment using two or a number of radar sensors is greatly appreciated.
However, the use of multiple radars does not significantly improve accuracy or performance, so
they were not applied.

P1L37 “Neonatal movements” -> Authors probably mean “neonatal voluntary
movements“ instead of “neonatal chest movements”
Thanks for your comment. As your comment, “Neonatal movements” means "neonatal voluntary
movement". To help understand, we have changed all the "neonatal movement" in the text to
"neonatal voluntary movement".
(Summary and section 3.5)
P1 Please add information in the abstract about the respiratory status of the PICU neonates:
e.g. non-mechanically assisted spontaneous breathing neonates?
Thanks for your comment. As your comment, we have added the respiratory status of the neonates
in the summary of manuscript as follows; “Neonate without any respiratory support”.
(Summary section)
P1L39 The authors describe their finding as “excellent agreement” for M0 measurements. But
what do define as excellent, because the LOA are rather wide [-9.6–10.0] for a vital parameter
with normal values between 30-60 breaths per minute for a neonate.
Thank you for the comment. We have changed the term “excellent” to “good”.
(Summary and Result section)
In terms of the wide LOA issue you pointed out, we’d like to give some additional explanation. In
newborn babies, periodic breathing, which is regular cycles of short apneic pauses and breaths, is
a normal variation of breathing and common. Therefore, these wide LOA values can be clinically
acceptable can be explained. (JV Kraaijenga et al, Pediatric Pulm 2015;50:889-895, M Patino et al,
Pediatric Anesthesia 2013;23:1166-1173, JC Cobos-Torres et al, Sensors 2018;18:4362-4375)
P2L33 This should be considered as part of your results: “Six neonates were eligible for the
experiments among 42 full-term neonates (= 37 weeks of gestational age)” and is not a
description of the study plan.
Thank you for your comment. In accordance with your comment, we transferred description about
the number of selected subjects to the result part.
(Result section)
P2L36 Why would you exclude neonates with “dyspnea, sustained tachypnea (RR > 60
breaths/min)”? These are the interesting ones, on P2L7 the authors describe that these devices
are seldom evaluated in actual clinical practices and I read this as that they are aiming to
evaluate IR-UWB in a clinical setting. A device should also perform well in abnormal clinical
situations.
Thanks for your comment. Our study is the first pilot investigation and the aim is to study whether
the IR-UWB radar is feasible and accurate enough to be used as a continuous noncontact vital sign
monitoring in the NICU environment.
In cases of sustained tachypnea, it was difficult to obtain data continuously for sufficient durations
because clinical interaction and interventions between the clinical staff and the patients such as
blood sampling, feeding, dressing and injections were too frequent. Although we excluded patients
with sustained tachypnea, our data still have 4% of samples (N=118) with respiratory rates > 60
breaths/min since the respiratory rates of patients were fluctuating. The results (revised Figure 5
and Table 2) showed that the agreement level in patients with mean RRs = 40 breaths/min was
even higher than the patients with mean RRs < 40 breaths/min. In the range of respiratory rates
>60 breaths/min, Bland-Altman plot showed that the mean bias level was non-significant and the
width of LOAs was even narrower than those results from the whole samples (please see the figure
below). Therefore, although the radar should be evaluated in the wider range of respiratory rate in
future, we think that agreement between the radar and IP would be similar in the range of
respiratory rates > 60 breaths/min. Moreover, we are planning for the future clinical trials in which
the performance of the radar will be tested in more complicated clinical situations such as
mechanical ventilation and in various patients with cardiorespiratory diseases. In accordance with
your comment, we discussed about this issue more in the Discussion section.
(Discussion section, page 5, 4th paragraph).
P2L40 Did the authors preplanned how long the experiment would take per neonate? Did the
authors predefine what they would consider acceptable limits of agreement?
Thanks for your comment. Before recording by the radar, we have planned to measure at least 100
min as long as the surrounding conditions of the patients were permitted. The recording was
terminated while the patients met family members or visitors, or in any situations requiring a long
pause of the recording. However, in short interruptions during the recording such as feeding, diaper
change or injections the recording was continued. Then, we excluded the data obtained during the
short interruptions from the final analysis, as we have described in the method. In accordance with
your comment, the total recoding times and valid recording times, in which the interrupted
moments were excluded, were described in Supplementary Table 1.
P3L9 Is the averaging time also 10 seconds?
Thanks for your comment. The averaged value of respiratory rate is calculated using the values of
the last 30 seconds. Samples used in actual statistics were updated every 10 seconds with the
averaged values derived during the last 30 seconds.
(page 3, section 3.4, last paragraph)
P3L14 I like the way the authors were able to define the extent of movement. I hope that the
authors can reassure us that this method does not classify a deep breath as an M1. After all,
motion of breathing is not constant, with regular changes between shallow breathing and deep
breaths.
Thanks for your comment. The logic to differentiate baby’s breathing from movement as follows.
When detecting patient’s movements, we use autocorrelation function. Autocorrelation is the
analysis of a periodic signal with noise in a given signal. When checking autocorrelation on a given
respiration signal, if there is little movement, the main lobe of autocorrelation will be large by the
respiratory waveform, and vice versa, if the periodic component of the waveform is eliminated by
the motion due to the large movements, the main lobe will be greatly reduced. The size of the
main lobe means the initial zero-crossing width of the respiratory signal through the autocorrelation
function. Therefore, if the periodicity of the signals extracted from the radar is checked even with
deep breathing, autocorrelation can determine that there is no movement by other bodies. Also,
video recording was performed during the experiment to verify the degree of movement. The
picture below is an experimental environment that combines video recording.
(Discussion section, last paragraph)
P3L37 For this type of data, with repeated measurements for every participant, it is unusual
and misleading to present correlation coefficients. This very nicely explained by Bland and
Altman. They also wrote an article about methods comparison studies with multiple
observations per individual and how this data should be handled differently.
http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10543400701329422
Thank you for the comment. As you have commented, these data are repeated measure data with
unequal numbers of replicates and in pair. Because the heterogenesity that might be lurking in the
data could increase the variation of the biases between the two measurements, we agree that we
need to use a different analysis method. As you have recommended, we have adopted the method
for the assessment of agreement with multiple observation per individual to analyze our data and
revised the limits of agreement in the results. First, we performed the analysis of variance (ANOVA)
test for the differences between the RRRadar and RRIP (Y) and subjects (X) to estimate the mean
square within subjects (MSw) and the mean square between subjects (MSb), then calculated the
variance of the difference between the RRRadar and RRIP, using the following formula as previously
described in the article written by Bland and Altman that you have recommend.
The following R output presents the calculation of the new standard deviation for the RR in all
movement levels.
As you can see in the analysis results, the newly calculated standard deviation is actually very similar
to the original standard deviation (0.05 in difference). We think that this result occurred because
there is only a small amount of heterogenesity in the data as you can see in the following figures.
We revised the results in our manuscript using the newly calculated standard deviations in
accordance with your comments.
(page 3, section 3.6)
P3L59 I agree with the authors that this breathing trace represents matched respiratory signals.
However, this does not explain why, even if only M0 measurements pairs are selected, there
is still some considerable spread around the bias (represented by the rather wide LOA),
especially at an average breathing rate of 40 breaths/minute. Have the authors looked into
detail to these traces to understand why there’s such a large discrepancy between the devices
in other measurements? Consider for example cardiac rhythm disturbances that interfere with
IP signals? If the authors suspect that a large proportion of the measurement error is due to
“failure” of IP measurements it would be worthwhile to look the editorial written by Myles in
the Br J Anaesthesia 2007.
First, In terms of wide LOA issue, we already described earlier.
As you pointed out, there is a short segment of discrepancies at 52 to 54 minutes as shown in Fig
3B. Interestingly, a closer look through the video camera and manual counting could verify signal
perturbation in the CM in contrast to the stable radar signal. Calculation time lag could also be
another cause of this discrepancies, because there is a difference between two methods to calculate
the new baseline value from real-time respiratory signals whenever a big change in rate occurs.
Moreover, since the time-window used to obtain respiration rate from the IR-UWB radar sensor is
8 seconds, once a movement is detected, it takes at least 8 seconds to exclude the effects of
movement from the respiratory rate. Another possible explanations are an overestimation of small
superficial diaphragmatic contraction or underestimation of true small breathing movement by the
IP.
(Discussion section, last paragraph)
In IR-UWB radar system, interference by cardiac rhythm can be rarely occurred because RR and
heartbeats are selected from the different frequency domain as follows.
P4L10 I would suggest removing the correlation coefficients from the paper and also the
correlation plots in Figure 4. Because correlation in this type of research is misleading.
Thank you for the comments. As you commented, Pearson’s correlation coefficients are not
appropriate indexes for evaluating the levels of agreement between two raters. Therefore, we have
calculated intraclass correlation coefficients and presented those for all comparisons. We agree the
presentation of the Pearson’s correlation r could be misleading, and we decided to remove those
altogether. The scatterplot of the data was simply used to graphically present the distribution of
the data. But we also agree that the drawing the pitting lines and confidence interval lines with
Pearson’s correlation coefficients would have misled the readers. Therefore, as you have
recommended, we decided to remove the all the correlation plot in the results and replace the one
correlation plot for all data to a simple scatterplot with graphical presentation of data points from
individual subjects. Furthermore, we also decided to report concordance correlation coefficient
alongside with the intraclass correlation coefficients. Concordance correlation coefficient is a well-
established semi-quantitative statistics to measure an agreement level between two raters for data
with multiple measurements in a subject just as ours (TS King et al, Stat Med, 2007;26:3095-3113)
P4L54 I am not fully convinced by the results that IR-UWB can accurately measure respiratory
rate in neonates. The bias measurement is excellent, however the LOA are rather wide also
when M1 an M2 measurements are removed. A 10 breaths/minute difference can be clinically
relevant. Personally, I am not so disturbed by artifacts due to voluntary movement, this
indicates that the neonate is active and thus alive. I would suggest that the authors think of
clinical situations in which the IR-UWB would detect breathing but the neonate is at risk of
respiratory failure. E.g. upper airway obstruction, or epileptic activity. These situations should
be recognized and should not produce falsely reassuring respiratory rate numbers.
Thank you for the comment. As we mentioned early, we used the specified Logic to differentiate
between voluntary movement and breathing. Besides, the monitor can display distinctive waveforms
derived from the radar. For your information, our team has recently published the paper about
detection and quantification of movement of various scenarios by the IR-UWB radar (Quanti<U+FB01>ed
Activity Measurement for Medical Use in Movement Disorders through IR-UWB Radar Sensor.
Sensors (Basel). 2019;19(3). pii: E688. doi: 10.3390/s19030688)
Even conventional, standard IP itself has begun to be used with similar drawbacks (TC Li, J Perinat
Med 1977;5:223-227). Above all, the radar has the advantage of noncontact and noninvasive sensor
and it can be used as a back-up cardiorespiratory monitor for a more secure monitor system, or as
a main monitor for a relative healthier neonate who does not necessarily require full ECG
information. As waveforms from the IR-UWB radar depict information on diaphragmatic activity and
chest wall kinetics, it might address the additional value to detect and classify apnea of prematurity,
wake and sleep cycles in neonates, neonatal seizures, and lung mechanics (an index of respiratory
discomfort) in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. This novel perspective may enable a crucial
means of home monitoring for high-risk infants and early prevention of sudden infant death
syndrome.
Figure 5. I do not see the additive value of this figure.
Thank you for the comment. It does seem for Figure 5 to have no addictive value to the article,
because it repeats the same data already shown in the other figures, including ICC and difference
between the RRRd and the RRIP. But actually, we have shown this figure because we would have like
to show the influences of movements and RR on the bias levels and accuracy of the radar
measurements. Therefore, we revised the figure so that we could present the influences of
movements and RR on the bias levels and accuracy of the radar measurement more clearly, by
dividing the subjects using the mean RR = 40 bpm.
