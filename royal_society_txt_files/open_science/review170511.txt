***************************
Appendix A
The paper “Modelling the role of correctional services on gangs: Insights through a
mathematical model” introduces an infection-type ODE model to describe gang
populations. The total population varies over time and is divided into at-risk and not at-risk
individuals, active gang members and those who are incarcerated.
Induction into a gang is due to interactions with already established gang members, but
becoming at risk is solely due to socio-economic status, which, the authors claim, is
important in the South African context.
The paper is suitable for publication provided the following are addressed:
1. Does the quadratic behavior in the f(S_r, G) form affect the dynamics? Meaning would
things change if \eta = 0?
3. To people who are not familiar with reproduction numbers, the quantity R_g will emerge
as a total surprise. A better discussion should be included on how to calculate R_g from Eqs.
2.1. When R_g is introduced, there are lots of references but still, the paper should be self-
explicatory. Also, the dependence of R_g on all parameters (\theta, \sigma etc) should be
discussed even before performing the sensitivity analysis. Why does it increase or decrease
with given parameters? Is there anything unexpected about these dependencies?
4. The authors spend some time proving that a backwards (subcritical) bifurcation
emerges from their ODE model. Why is this important? There should be a discussion on the
implication of this result for crime prevention, spread or other kinds of practical outcomes
that this subcritical bifurcation entails.
5. In the discussion more emphasis should be placed on the “useful and practical results
that can be of help to policy makers in fighting against gangsterism, gang violence and its
related crimes”. What are these practical results, except for sufficiently large \epsilon is
necessary to stop gang proliferation? A list that non-math specialists could use, would be
very important to include
6. In figures 3,4,5 what are the times? Years? Months? What can we say about the time
scales involved? In Figure 6 is this R_g? If so, it should be specified in the caption.
7. Table 1 should be moved earlier, and an entry on the table should be the definition of all
parameters so that the reader has an easier time navigating through their meaning, in case
he/she needs an immediate reminder. Like: \gamma | sentencing rate | 0.8. Also the
maximum allowed value should be included. Are they all assumed to be < 1?
7. Since one of the main conclusions of this work is that the efficiency of correctional
services is of primary importance in stopping gang proliferation, the paper should
reference other mathematical work in the context of crime, punishment and deterrence,
especially all the work that has been done using game theoretic models, such as
Recidivism and rehabilitation of criminal offenders: a carrot and stick evolutionary game,

acknowledged as part of crime and should be considered in
prevention and policy designs when developing interventions

ponses to the Review of our Manuscript #RSOS-170511
are grateful for the review on our manuscript Number: RSOS-170511 and the insightful comments
ed by the anonymous reviewers.
ow are our responses to the concerns raised by the reviewer(s);
1. Does the quadratic behavior in the f(S_r,G) form affect the dynamics? Meaning would things
change if \eta = 0?
Yes, the quadratic form of the incidence function is the source of backward bifurcation
and leads to the existence of multiple gang-persistent equilibria whereas for \eta = 0 the
system will have a forward bifurcation and a unique gang-persistent equilibrium. We have
added a paragraph to explain this.
2. To people who are not familiar with reproduction numbers, the quantity R_g will emerge as a total
surprise. A better discussion should be included on how to calculate R_g from Eqs. 2.1. When
R_g is introduced, there are lots of references but still, the paper should be self-explicatory. Also,
the dependence of R_g on all parameters (\theta, \sigma etc) should be discussed even before
performing the sensitivity analysis. Why does it increase or decrease with given parameters? Is
there anything unexpected about these dependencies?
Thank you for this important comment. We have added the calculations of R_g and the
explanations are given, see subsections 3(b) and 3(c).
3. The authors spend some time proving that a backward (subcritical) bifurcation emerges from their
ODE model. Why is it important? There should be a discussion on the implication of this result for
crime prevention, spread or other kinds of practical outcomes that this subcritical bifurcation
entails.
Done. Study of backward (subcritical) bifurcation is of interest because in epidemic modeling,
the basic reproduction number, R_0, which is the key concept in epidemiology, should be
decreased to below unity to eradicate the disease. However, in our model the existence of
backward bifurcation entails that gangs may persist in the population even with values of R_g
less than unity. A discussion of the implications of such a scenario has been included in the
Backward Bifurcation section.
4. In the discussion more emphasis should be placed on the “useful and practical results that can be
of help to policy makers in fighting against gangsterism, gang violence and its related crimes”.
What are these practical results, except for sufficiently large \epsilon is necessary to stop gang
proliferation? A list that non-math specialists could use, would be very important to include.
Done.
5. In figures 3,4,5 what are the times? Years? Months? What can we say about the time scales
involved? In Figure 6 is this R_g? If so, it should be specified in the caption.
The time is in months and we have added some comments in the captions of the figures.
6. Table 1 should be moved earlier, and an entry on the table should be the definition of all
parameters so that the reader has an easier time navigating through their meaning, in case
he/she needs an immediate reminder. Like: \gamma | sentencing rate | 0.8. Also the maximum
allowed value should be included. Are they all assumed to be < 1?
Done.
7. Since one of the main conclusions of this work is that the efficiency of correctional services is of
primary importance in stopping gang proliferation, the paper should reference other mathematical
work in the context of crime, punishment and deterrence, especially all the work that has been
done using game theoretic models, such as Recidivism and rehabilitation of criminal offenders: a
carrot and stick evolutionary game.
Done.
