Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
I like this paper: I think it suitably focussed and well written, covering the relevant topic and
providing support for arguments well. I have marked up the PDF with various minor comments,
and include those below. Additionally, I have the immediately following considerations meant in
the spirit of clarifying and supporting the authors conclusions.
# Considerations
## Dorsal view images
While the authors have described the skull as highly laterally compressed – and seemingly
concertinaed – I wonder whether having a dorsal view image of the anterior (preorbital) rostrum
would be useful to delineate sutures between contralateral elements. I'm particularly thinking
about the extant of the medial premaxilla-frontal contacts between the external naris and orbit. I
am uncertain from the images and description, but it may be that this region is
obliterated/difficult to interpret. Fig. 2c includes part of this, but may be extended anteriorly.
## Phylogenetic analyses
I was not able to analyse the phylogenetic data in PAUP* with PAUPRat, so I cannot confirm this
with the exact methodology used. Analysing in TNT with PAUP*-like settings I do get the same
results. However, I don't get the same results analysing with the default settings in TNT. This
largely stems (I think) from the different collapsing rules and the thus the different optimizations
of characters based on this. From the TNT analysis, the tree is less well resolved. This does not
affect the discussion of Occultonectia, but may influence the optimizations done for the
macroevolutionary component. The different collapsing methods may be more of less applicable
given the relevant coding schemes (Brazeau 2011, doi:10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01755.x).
While this likely will not greatly affect the argument made, I think that adding various support
values to the presented trees – particularly related to Occultonectia as a newly named clade – will
lend support to the authors' argument for this erection and definition.
## New clade: Occultonectia
The new clade is defined as the stem that includes _Plesiopleurodon wellesi,_ but excludes
_Palmulasaurus quadratus._ This is specifically to include _Sulcusuchus erraini, Plesiopleurodon
wellesi,_ and the 'Richmond pliosaur' (as indicated in Fig. 7). However, given the two
phylogenetic hypotheses presented (Fig. 7a, b) this is not presented consistently. In Fig. 7a, given
the prescribed definition _Pahasapasaurus haasi_ should also be included in Occultonectia. Also,
I think that displaying the clade as referring to a node in Fig. 7 a & b is a bit iffy given the stem-
based definition.
# Minor issues
A few spelling and grammatical errors are found throughout. I've also made some suggestions to
clarify the meaning of the text (e.g. pp 8, 10).
The abbreviation 'QM' (for QM F18041) is not included in the list of abbreviations.
3
The description of the taphonomy of MHNGr PA 11710 may need to be done more clearly. I
suggest against using 'transversely' as a description of the compression direction(s) as this
represents an anatomical plane, so could potentially refer to any vector within that. (I may be
being dense here, but it confused me initially.) Later 'laterally' is used, which I favour. Additional
qualification and relative movement of elements is made at the relevant parts and is clearer. If
there is oblique crushing (i.e. both lateral and dorsoventral), this should be described as best can
be.
A few labels in the figures are close together and should be separated for clarity.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
I think this is a fine contribution, and have only minor comments below.
They are roughly arranged from most concerned to the least.
1) L635-637: I am very skeptical about the establishing this clade
Occultnectia in which two of three OTUs have very limited information due to
the lack of adequate material (more than 50% missing data in Sulcisuchus and
Plesiopleurodon, according to ESM 2), whereas the remaining OTU is a
specimen without formal description or taxonomic designation so the readers
have no ways to check the scoring ('Richmond pliosaur'). In addition, this
4
analysis does not provide confidence levels of the clades (bootstrap, decay
index etc), and we do not know how confident we can be about the presence of
this clade.
I am also concerned about the stability of the clade, because of the use of
the fragmentary Sulcisuchus as a specifier in definition. The large
percentage of missing data means we know so little about this taxon. Do not
try too hard to put little known things together wtihout a solid set of
confirmed shared derived features.<br>
2) L161-164: As a reader who is not very familiar with the mathematical
basis of the softwares used in this study, I wonder how the precision of
their stratigraphic data affects the conclusion. The authors states their
phylogeny fits the stratigraphic data, but I am concerned about the effects
of the ranges. Age data for most Late Cretaceous forms use full ranges of
the "ages" in timescale (e.g., Cenomanian), but many OTUs are represented by
single specimens from a single horizon, and it does not mean the OTU lived
throughout the geological age(s). I also noted that the age of D.
herchelensis is given as Campanian, but it is from Campanian-Mastrichtian
border, and it is impossible to choose one age over the other.
3) L181-189 etc (use of juvenile specimens): Like Manemergus, the holotype
of D. osborni is clearly a juvenile but included in this analysis. Is it
justified?
4) L612-620: Then, "the a posteriori method to identify wildcard taxa" are
not quite functional, and it may have removed other non-wildcard taxa a
well, I'm afraid. Have the authors considered Adams consensus (in theory,
the single OTUs in the polytomy are possible wild cards) or other methods if
there are any?
5
5) L623-625: It is certainly possible, but the very low reduced consistency
indexes indicate frequent reversal or parallelism. The assumption of
"juvenile = primitive = basal in phylogeny" is a bit too simplistic and
subjective interpretation.
6) For Figures 1 and S1, no need for two almost same two figs in one paper.
Decide whether or not you need the phylogeny in Druckenmiller and Russell
for the conclusion of this paper.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Robert Sansom):
This is a substantial contribution for which the reviewers raised only minor revisions. Both
suggested that the definition of "Occultonectia" needed more precision/caution, and that support
values should be added to the phylogeny. I agree on both counts (indeed "stem-based clade" has
very little meaning for an entirely extinct group). I would also like to see the TNT settings and
search parameters stipulated in the manuscript. I am happy to recommend publication of this
manuscript in RSOS once these minor revisions have been made.

==> We understand all the reviewers' concerns and we thank them for their fair and constructive
comments and suggestions. Please see the individual responses for each of their queries below.
==> We have replaced 'stem-based' with 'branch-based' in our definition of Occultonectia as it could
be confusing. This referred to the schema for phylogenetic clade definitions from work in the 1990s by
de Querioz and Gauthier (now 'phylocode'). We did not intend this in the sense of crown-/stem-group
names as used in other contexts, and especially more recently.

see below for individual responses to each major concern.
# Considerations
## Dorsal view images
While the authors have described the skull as highly laterally compressed - and seemingly
concertinaed - I wonder whether having a dorsal view image of the anterior (preorbital) rostrum would
be useful to delineate sutures between contralateral elements. I'm particularly thinking about the
extant of the medial premaxilla-frontal contacts between the external naris and orbit. I am uncertain
from the images and description, but it may be that this region is obliterated/difficult to interpret. Fig.
2c includes part of this, but may be extended anteriorly.
==> This is a valuable suggestion; we have created a new figure for this region (the new figure 4).
## Phylogenetic analyses
I was not able to analyse the phylogenetic data in PAUP* with PAUPRat, so I cannot confirm this with
the exact methodology used. Analysing in TNT with PAUP*-like settings I do get the same results.
However, I don't get the same results analysing with the default settings in TNT. This largely stems (I
think) from the different collapsing rules and the thus the different optimizations of characters based
on this. From the TNT analysis, the tree is less well resolved. This does not affect the discussion of
Occultonectia, but may influence the optimizations done for the macroevolutionary component. The
different collapsing methods may be more of less applicable given the relevant coding schemes
(Brazeau 2011, doi:10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01755.x).
While this likely will not greatly affect the argument made, I think that adding various support values
to the presented trees - particularly related to Occultonectia as a newly named clade - will lend
support to the authors' argument for this erection and definition.
==> There might be a confusion here, as we also used TNT, not PAUP* and PAUPRat. This confusion
certainly arose because our methods section was not complete enough and we substantially completed
it in the present revised version of the manuscript. We have mentioned all the options we used for
tree search. Moreover, we compute the consensus directly in R using the ape package as the
collapsing behaviour of TNT appears sometimes unreliable for reasons that are totally unclear to us.
We have also added this information in the Methods section.
## New clade: Occultonectia
The new clade is defined as the stem that includes _Plesiopleurodon wellesi,_ but excludes
_Palmulasaurus quadratus._ This is specifically to include _Sulcusuchus erraini, Plesiopleurodon
wellesi,_ and the 'Richmond pliosaur' (as indicated in Fig. 7). However, given the two phylogenetic
hypotheses presented (Fig. 7a, b) this is not presented consistently. In Fig. 7a, given the prescribed
definition _Pahasapasaurus haasi_ should also be included in Occultonectia. Also, I think that
displaying the clade as referring to a node in Fig. 7 a & b is a bit iffy given the stem-based definition.
==> We fully agree here as well. We have modified the definition accordingly and have added a
remark stating that the name should not be used in cases where specifiers of Palmulasaurinae or
Polycotylinae are found to be more closely related to Sulcusuchus than to Plesiopleurodon or the
Richmond plesiosaur
# Minor issues
A few spelling and grammatical errors are found throughout. I've also made some suggestions to
clarify the meaning of the text (e.g. pp 8, 10).
The abbreviation 'QM' (for QM F18041) is not included in the list of abbreviations.
==>We have added this abbreviation.
The description of the taphonomy of MHNGr PA 11710 may need to be done more clearly. I suggest
against using 'transversely' as a description of the compression direction(s) as this represents an
anatomical plane, so could potentially refer to any vector within that. (I may be being dense here, but
it confused me initially.) Later 'laterally' is used, which I favour. Additional qualification and relative
movement of elements is made at the relevant parts and is clearer. If there is oblique crushing (i.e.
both lateral and dorsoventral), this should be described as best can be.
==> We have modified the text accordingly; all instances of "transverse(ly)" have been modified
when discussing the crushing / taphonomy / diagenesis of the skull.
A few labels in the figures are close together and should be separated for clarity.
==> We have modified the figure accordingly.

percentage of missing data means we know so little about this taxon. Do not
try too hard to put little known things together wtihout a solid set of
confirmed shared derived features.
==> We fully understand the concerns of reviewer 2. We chose to erect this clade and we propose to
stand by this decision because of the close relationship between Plesiopleurodon and the 'Richmond
pliosaur', which has been recovered in a series of distinct analyses prior to ours [1-5]. The
completeness of taxa does not necessarily correlate with chance of erroneous phylogenetic placement,
since an OTU can, for example, preserve the crucial synapomorphies of a clade, yielding credible
phylogenetic placement (but obviously low bootstrap and Jacknife values). This is also why the a
posteriori method to identify wildcard taxa is probably a better idea that just suppressing taxa with
X% missing data to cope with poorly resolved consensus trees.
The inclusion - in a phylogenetic dataset - of specimens that have not been formally described in a
published paper is a common practice, notably because phylogenetic accurateness is probably
improved by a wider taxon sampling [6,7]. Discarding the publicly available data (in the sense that the
specimen can be accessed and studied by anyone) on the 'Richmond pliosaur' might thus be
detrimental to the quality of our phylogenetic results, even if we fully agree that a thorough
morphological description of the 'Richmond pliosaur' is long due and would be ideal.
The suggestion to add support values is sensible and these should indeed be present. We have
computed bootstrap and Jacknife values, as well as Bremer Decay indices for our consensus trees and
the relevant information has been added to the corresponding figure. As expected, the amount of
missing data results in a poor support of Occultonectia (and most plesiosaurian clade, for the matter,
such as Pliosauridae, Elasmosauridae, etc.) because the available methods in maximum parsimony
(resampling and Bremer decay) are directly affected by the sheer amount of missing data in basal
lineages.
2) L161-164: As a reader who is not very familiar with the mathematical
basis of the softwares used in this study, I wonder how the precision of
their stratigraphic data affects the conclusion. The authors states their
phylogeny fits the stratigraphic data, but I am concerned about the effects
of the ranges. Age data for most Late Cretaceous forms use full ranges of
the "ages" in timescale (e.g., Cenomanian), but many OTUs are represented by
single specimens from a single horizon, and it does not mean the OTU lived
throughout the geological age(s). I also noted that the age of D.
herchelensis is given as Campanian, but it is from Campanian-Mastrichtian
border, and it is impossible to choose one age over the other.
==> The methods that estimate stratigraphic congruence are affected by branch lengths, so indeed, a
better precision on taxon ranges will yield more accurate values. However, it would change the results
marginally as (i) the value for the most parsimonious trees is always compared to random trees that
use the same taxon ranges. Thus, increased precision in the dataset will yield different values for the
random trees as well. We speak of stratigraphically-congruent results when the most parsimonious are
clearly better than the random trees. (ii) The changes in branch lengths by the increased precision
would need to be distributed asymmetrically in time to change the absolute congruence value, which
we do not expect.
We have also corrected the age uncertainty for D. herschelensis. This has minor ramifications in the
diversity over time figure (Figure 8) and result tables in the supplementary information, which have all
been modified accordingly.
3) L181-189 etc (use of juvenile specimens): Like Manemergus, the holotype
of D. osborni is clearly a juvenile but included in this analysis. Is it
justified?
==> We thank the referee for bringing this to our attention, and it clearly warrants further
explanation. It is true that D. osborni, and potentially other taxa in our analysis, are represented by
somewhat immature individuals. But these are all generally quite large, and have at least some signs
of approaching maturity. The holotype of Manemergus, by contrast, is very small, and has the
osteological signs of a relatively early-stage juvenile. There is a difference between these stages of
development. We have added this text to the Methods: "Some other polycotylids, which are included
in our analysis, may be represented by subadult or slightly immature specimens. However, M.
anguirostris has very small body size, and bears osteological indicators of young juvenile status,
including the extremely incomplete ossification of girdle elements, and the presence of a large cranial
fontanelle."
4) L612-620: Then, "the a posteriori method to identify wildcard taxa" are
not quite functional, and it may have removed other non-wildcard taxa a
well, I'm afraid. Have the authors considered Adams consensus (in theory,
the single OTUs in the polytomy are possible wild cards) or other methods if
there are any?
==> We are not aware of a systemic bug in the algorithm of the Pol & Escapa [8] method and this
method is widely used in maximum parsimony analyses [5,9,10]. We were simply willing to emphasise
the fact that a well resolved tree is recovered even if we keep Thililua in the dataset and that the
removal of Manemergus is the key to obtain a well resolved tree for polycotylids- we have modified
the text accordingly. An Adams consensus gives, in our opinion, a false impression by placing some
taxa systematically more basally than the true range of the most parsimonious solutions and should
be used to identify wildcard taxa, first and foremost. This, added to the issues we highlight with the
holotype of Manemergus (sharing a long series characters with Thililua but exhibiting a juvenile
morphology) results in an Adams consensus with, as expected, Thililua an Manemergus recovered in
polytomy of early leptocleidians. We think the a posteriori method is superior in recovering the
probably genuine phylogenetic signal linking the OTUs of our analyses. The only other method we are
aware of that can resolve polytomies in a maximum parsimony framework is the a posteriori time
calibration method Cal3 [11,12]. This method resolves some polytomies based on a stochastic process
that uses taxon ranges to estimate the position of nodes in time. Given the generally wide and
somewhat artificial 'ranges' available for most Mesozoic vertebrates, we think this option is also
suboptimal compared to the a posteriori method of Pol & Escapa [8].
5) L623-625: It is certainly possible, but the very low reduced consistency
indexes indicate frequent reversal or parallelism. The assumption of
"juvenile = primitive = basal in phylogeny" is a bit too simplistic and
subjective interpretation.
==> This interpretation is notably based on our experience with derived ichthyosaurs, where juvenile
ophthalmosaurids systematically exhibit a primitive condition, notably in the appendicular skeleton
[13,14]. It is also directly substantiated by our results: Thililua and Manemergus share several
features (which are not included in the phylogenetic dataset) that collectively suggest a very close
relationship, possibly congeneric, as we argue in the paper. The inclusion of Manemergus in the
phylogenetic dataset drags Thililua basally in Leptocleidia while its removal places Thililua close to the
polycotyline radiation. Generally, we propose that very juvenile specimens should not be included in
phylogenetic datasets for the sake of quality control.
6) For Figures 1 and S1, no need for two almost same two figs in one paper.
Decide whether or not you need the phylogeny in Druckenmiller and Russell
for the conclusion of this paper.
