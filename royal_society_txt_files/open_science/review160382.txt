Page 5, lines 209-210, and Figure 2C and 2F. Something is very wrong here. The narrative of the
results reports 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios, whereas the units of Figure 2C and 2F reverse the numerator
and denominator (ie. 5-HT/5-HIAA ratios). The data in the sentence (209-210) does not match
the graphs. Is the label on the y axis of Figure 2C and 2F incorrect? Also, data in Figure 2E
reports 5-HIAA levels (not ratios), and according to Figure 2F, there is a strong tendency for
higher ratios (not lower ratios).
The authors need to re-phrase/re-emphasize their conclusions to better represent their data, as
follows:
Page 6, line 231-234: The authors state that salmon exposed to stress during early life display a
mitigated monoaminergic response in all 3 monoaminergic systems examined. This conclusion is
NOT supported by the data. According to the data, there is no significant effect on the
serotonergic system. The author's need to better qualify this conclusion statement by
emphasizing that only 2 of the systems were significantly effected by stress, and that these effects
were limited to the hypothalamus, not the brainstem.
The above comment also applies to conclusions made on Page 1 (lines 24-26), Page 7 (lines 292-
293), Page 9 (lines 348-349). Again, authors should qualify their conclusions to emphasize only
some, not all monoaminergic systems were mitigated by stress and that not all brain regions
examined were affected.
Page 7, line 278-280: The authors state that salmon exposed to stress during early life displayed
"better growth performance". I do not agree with this statement. Stressed salmon did NOT
exhibit "better growth performance", they exhibited "compensatory" growth, due to reduced
feeding/slower growth during the period of stress. It is true that they were able to shift
allocation of resources to speed up growth, but I believe "better growth performance" implies this
group was significantly "bigger" at the end of the experiment, which was not the case. The
authors should rephrase this statement, removing reference to "better growth performance".

The manuscript by Vindas and colleagues show important findings suggesting that early life
stress (UCS) has long-term effects in responses to acute stress later in life. These results suggest
that UCS in early rearing of Atlantic salmon induced overall lower brain monoaminergic
response to stress compared to controls. This is a very interesting effect, because early life UCS
protocol appears to convey beneficial effects on coping with acute stress. In addition, salmon
growth rates were compared to UCS and unstressed controls after smoltification, a particularly
challenging life stage, and after seawater transfer
Overall, the manuscript is well written, the methodological approach is sound, and the analysis
of monoamine neurochemistry to determine stress reactivity in the hypothalamus and brain stem
appears to be well performed. The data are solid and able to test the authors’ proposed
hypothesis. However several points would need to be better clarified and discussed in this paper.
A question that arises in light of the results is about the long-term alterations provoked by the
early UCS experience by the fish. What has been changed by the early repetitive stress that leads
to the mitigated stress response later? How the activation of the stress axis is involved in this
effect modulating hypothalamic monoamine levels in UCS groups? The authors should propose
possible underlying mechanisms mediating this effect. Could a causal effect of monoamine levels
be tested?
Please discuss the different roles for brain stem and hypothalamic monoaminergic transmission
in early UCS and acute stress responses, are different neural circuits involved?
The effects of UCS on the aspects studied are clear. However, the authors do not report the effects
of any behavioural parameters. Are there any available relevant behavioral data to correlate with
biometric/neurochemical?
UCS fish had a significantly higher growth rate during smoltification and after seawater transfer
compared to control fish. The authors suggest a better use of resources during this time-period
and a compensatory growth rate in UCS groups and the role of serotonin, but they do not discuss
any underlying mechanism, e.g. how serotonin may participate in stress habituation or coping?
Methods
The experimental protocol is quite complicated and to my opinion would be nice to prepare a
figure (including sampling time-points) to be more clearly illustrated.
In Methods (part 2.3 Final sampling protocol), please provide the density of fish, when fish were
left to recover, after acute stress, for 1 hour before sampling in a 400 L tank.

Reviewer #3 (Comments to the authors):
1. Page 5, lines 209-210, and Figure 2C and 2F. Something is very wrong here. The narrative of the
results reports 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios, whereas the units of Figure 2C and 2F reverse the numerator and
denominator (ie. 5-HT/5-HIAA ratios). The data in the sentence (209-210) does not match the
graphs. Is the label on the y axis of Figure 2C and 2F incorrect? Also, data in Figure 2E reports 5-HIAA
levels (not ratios), and according to Figure 2F, there is a strong tendency for higher ratios (not lower
ratios).
There was indeed a mistake in the figure legend for the y axis in figures 2C and 2F. We calculated all
monoamine ratios as the relationship between the catabolite in terms of the neurotransmitter (as
explained in page 7 L 281-284) and the mistake in figures 2C and 2F was only at the level of the y axis
legend, not the actual ratio calculations. We are grateful to the reviewer for pointing this out and have
now corrected this (the figures are now 3C and 3F in the current manuscript version). In addition, we
have rewritten the statements presented on page 5 L 211-212, so that there are no inconsistencies
between the results section and figures.
2. Page 6, line 231-234: The authors state that salmon exposed to stress during early life display a
mitigated monoaminergic response in all 3 monoaminergic systems examined. This conclusion is NOT
supported by the data. According to the data, there is no significant effect on the serotonergic
system. The author's need to better qualify this conclusion statement by emphasizing that only 2 of the
systems were significantly effected by stress, and that these effects were limited to the hypothalamus,
not the brainstem. The above comment also applies to conclusions made on Page 1 (lines 24-26), Page
7 (lines 292-293), Page 9 (lines 348-349). Again, authors should qualify their conclusions to emphasize
only some, not all monoaminergic systems were mitigated by stress and that not all brain regions
examined were affected.
All statements (page 1 L 24-26L, page 6 L 233-235, page 7 L 291-292, page 9 L 354-356) have now
been rewritten in order to be more precise in what are findings are. That is, we found post-stress
mitigated hypothalamic catecholaminergic and brain stem serotonergic activity in UCS fish.
3. Page 7, line 278-280: The authors state that salmon exposed to stress during early life displayed
"better growth performance". I do not agree with this statement. Stressed salmon did NOT exhibit
"better growth performance", they exhibited "compensatory" growth, due to reduced feeding/slower
growth during the period of stress. It is true that they were able to shift allocation of resources to speed
up growth, but I believe "better growth performance" implies this group was significantly "bigger" at the
end of the experiment, which was not the case. The authors should rephrase this statement, removing
reference to "better growth performance".
The statement has been rewritten (page 7, L 278-280)
4. Figure 1A, Y axis (weight) is missing units.
The units have now been included (now figure 2A)
Reviewer 2 (Comments to the authors)
UCS experience by the fish. What has been changed by the early repetitive stress that leads to the
mitigated stress response later? How the activation of the stress axis is involved in this effect
modulating hypothalamic monoamine levels in UCS groups? The authors should propose possible
underlying mechanisms mediating this effect. Could a causal effect of monoamine levels be tested?
It would be indeed intriguing to try and elucidate possible mechanisms by which UCS may be mediating
a mitigated stress response. It is believed that through constant activation (due to stress) of neural
systems a desensitizing of key receptors may eventually lead to a mitigated response., CA systems
respond to novel stressful situations (as explained in page 8 L 325-328) and these systems are
particularly targeted in the mid brain (specifically in key regions of the hypothalamus), therefore through
constant activation of these systems during UCS, it is possible that CA receptors acquired a higher
activation threshold when responding to stressful stimuli. Meanwhile, the major nuclei for serotonin
synthesis are found in the brain stem (the raphe nuclei) and projections from these nuclei innervate all
brain regions, again it would be expected that serotonin receptors within the raphe could be desensitized
due to constant activation and that this would lead to a lower stress response by this system. However,
in the present work we do not have data on monoaminergic receptors and we can merely speculate on
possible mechanisms at play. We therefore feel that it is beyond the scope of this paper to include a
discussion on possible mechanisms and we therefore have only included in page 9 L365-371, a brief
note on the fact that the mechanism behind stress coping to repeated stressors is proposed by the
allostasis theory. However, if the editor/reviewer feels like including a more thorough discussion of this
topic would improve the manuscript we will be happy to comply.
2. Please discuss the different roles for brain stem and hypothalamic monoaminergic transmission in
early UCS and acute stress responses, are different neural circuits involved?
Generally speaking, the hypothalamus is the main neural multiregion hub controlling the stress
response. The hypothalamic-pituitary interrenal axis controls the stress response and as the name
implies, it is directly controlled by the hypothalamus. However, as explained in page 8 L 328-330 the
organization of monoamine systems and neural circuits is intricate and includes complex interactions in
the regulation of key-brain functions. For example, the negative feedback of the stress hormone cortisol
is regulated at several levels including a direct control by the hippocampus (in the telencephalon) via
glucocorticoid and serotonergic receptors.
While the serotonergic system innervates all brain regions and is involved in a myriad of physiological
processes, CA systems appear to target mainly midbrain and telencephalic areas, particularly neural
networks that are involved in novel stimuli salience (e.g. reward). In this context it could be proposed
that while CA transmission would mainly be affected in midbrain areas (e.g. hypothalamus),
serotonergic transmission could be affected throughout the whole brain, but this would be particularly
evident in the brain stem (since this area includes the Raphe nuclei). We feel that this discussion is
however beyond the scope of the present manuscript, since we are focusing on a more general
physiological view and less on neurobiological mechanisms (which we are planning to pursue in later
experiments). However, we are happy to include a discussion of this topic if the editor/reviewer feels
that it would improve the manuscript
3. The effects of UCS on the aspects studied are clear. However, the authors do not report the effects of
any behavioural parameters. Are there any available relevant behavioural data to correlate with
biometric/neurochemical?
We unfortunately have no behavioural data on these individuals
4. UCS fish had a significantly higher growth rate during smoltification and after seawater transfer
compared to control fish. The authors suggest a better use of resources during this time-period and a
compensatory growth rate in UCS groups and the role of serotonin, but they do not discuss any
underlying mechanism, e.g. how serotonin may participate in stress habituation or coping?
In page 7 L 296-299 we explain how it is believed that serotonin has a role in energy regulation. In fact,
it is believed that under stress, serotonin regulates the reallocation of energy from other process, such
as growth, towards coping with stress. We have now included some proposed specific mechanisms in
page 8 L 312-318: Interestingly, it has been proposed that the serotonergic system regulates energy
metabolism through several pathways including the regulation in the production of ATP from glucose by
stimulating the breakdown of glycogen from astrocytes via 5-HT1A heteroreceptors, the regulation of
glucagon and insulin secretion from pancreatic cells, the regulation of stored body fat through leptin
control of neuronal activity (neurons are major consumers of energy in the brain)
5. Methods
The experimental protocol is quite complicated and to my opinion would be nice to prepare a figure
(including sampling time-points) to be more clearly illustrated.
We have now included a figure for the experimental protocol (Figure 1)
6. In Methods (part 2.3 Final sampling protocol),
please provide the density of fish, when fish were left to recover, after acute stress, for 1 hour before
sampling in a 400 L tank.
We have now included the density (approximately 1.6 kg fish/tank) in the recovery tank after subjecting
individuals to the acute stressor in page 3 L 113.
