Appendix A
Response to reviewer comments
(Manuscript ID: RSOS-190351)
We highly appreciate the valuable comments of reviewers that are helpful for
significantly improving the manuscript quality. The manuscript has been thoroughly
revised accordingly. Each points of the comments are responded as follows.
Reviewer #1:
1. Indicate the purity of each chemical reagent used
Revised.
After revision:
Page 2 in the part of materials and chemical agents: Methylene blue (98.5%), acetic
acid (99.8%), sodium acetate (98%), sodium hydrogen phosphate (99%), hydrochloric
acid (36-38%), and sodium hydroxide (96%) are not further purified and are
purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai). Natural
manganese ore (MnOx, with a relative content of MnO2 75.38%)…
2. Characterize MnOx by FTIR spectroscopy
We have added the FTIR spectroscopy and analyzed the crystalline of MnOx.
After revision:
Page 4 in the characterization of MnOx section: The sample of MnOx was also
characterized using FTIR spectroscopy, which was the powerful tool to study
vibrational behavior of lattices and provide crystalline phases of MnOx in amorphous.
The FTIR spectra of MnOx were shown in figure 1b. MnOx has two strong band
located at 538.16 cm-1 and 580.59 cm-1, which were the characteristic adsorption
peaks of MnO2 (Mn-O) and the presence of two broad bands attributed to Mn3+-O
bending stretching vibration of todorokite could also be detected, which were located
at 468.72cm-1 and 1033.89 cm-1 [43-46]. In addition, the vibration peak at 3291.66
cm-1 was attributed to the symmetrical stretching vibration of hydroxyl (-OH) formed
by physical adsorption of water molecules or ion exchange.
3. Indicate the structure of crystalline MnOx based on XRD and FTIR
The article presented a natural manganese ore whose composition is more complex
and consists of manganese oxides, manganese hydroxides and some natural organic
compounds, as shown in XRD patterns. The FTIR was added to further reveal the
structure of crystalline MnOx.
The result was followed by comment 2.
4. Fit the experimental data to adsorption isotherms such as Langmuir and
Freundlich
Surely the removing process of MB must start with adsorption onto MnOx. However,
the adsorbed MB should be subsequently oxidized, as demonstrated in our study with
the shifted UV spectrum, the desorption test, and the identified intermediates.
Therefore, the adsorption isotherms were not applied.
5. It would be interesting to study the effect of temperature on the adsorption process
The temperature may give an effect in the degradation of MB. But, the work was
focus on exploring the reaction style and the degradation pathway in room
temperature. What’s more, the experiment data has proved that the removal of MB
was due to the chemical oxidation degradation by MnOx in low pH.
6. If possible, propose a mechanism for MB degradation by MnOx
The degradation mechanism for MB by MnOx has been suggested in the section 4 of
the manuscript. We concluded that the degradation of MB was initiated with the
demethylation, and the detection results of the intermediates also have verified the
hypothesis.
Reviewer #2:
1. Abstract is too shallow. It should be re-written.
We have revised the abstract.
After revision:
Page 1 in the abstract section. Though the surface area of MnOx was only 7.17 m2/g,
it performed well in the degradation of MB with a removal percentage 85.6% in pH 4.
Furthermore, several transformation products of MB were identified with HPLC-MS,
which was linked with the bond energy theory to reveal that the degradation was
initiated with demethylation.
2. Introduction is too short. Content is lag for the provided number of references.
Many new references were cited in the introduction section.
After revision:
Page 2 in the introduction part. New articles (14, 15, 17, 18, 29, 30, 37) were cited to
better support the introduction and other articles (40, 52) were cited to discuss.
3. Novelty is missing.
The purpose of the study was to supply a potential environmental material with cheap
price, easy to operation and from nature to treat wastewater. The research has
revealed an environment friendly material (MnOx) used to degraded the dyestuffs
wastewater with a huge reserves in nature.
4. Manuscript seems like a report rather than a scientific article.
The research has reported an available environmental material for treating dyestuffs
wastewater and proved the active style between the MnOx and MB in low pH. The
single factor experiments (pH, the dosage of MnOx and the concentration of MB)
were also conducted to study their effects on the removal of MB and the dynamic
process. On the other hand, the probable degradation course was supposed followed
the checked intermediates and the bond energy theory, from which the study
concluded that the degradation was initiated with demethylation.
5. Scientific discussions are missing throughout the manuscript.
In the discussion part of the article, we firstly make the reaction form clear that the
chemical oxidation degradation was stimulated in low pH, which was proved as
following: (1) the full wavelength scanning of the samples; (2) the concentration of
Mn2+ in the sample; (3) the desorption experiment was conducted. Then the effects on
the degradation of dosage of MnOx and the concentration of MB were also discussed,
respectively. The single factor experiments were performed to reveal the dynamic
process which would be benefit for its application.
6. Confirmation of MnOx ore is not enough.
We have added the FTIR spectroscopy of MnOx to further confirm the crystalline of
MnOx.
After revision:
Page 4 in the characterization of MnOx section: The sample of MnOx was also
characterized using FTIR spectroscopy, which was the powerful tool to study
vibrational behavior of lattices and provide crystalline phases of MnOx in amorphous.
The FTIR spectra of MnOx were shown in figure 1b. MnOx has two strong band
located at 538.16 cm-1 and 580.59 cm-1, which were the characteristic adsorption
peaks of MnO2 (Mn-O) and the presence of two broad bands attributed to Mn3+-O
bending stretching vibration of todorokite could also be detected, which were located
at 468.72cm-1 and 1033.89 cm-1 [43-46]. In addition, the vibration peak at 3291.66
cm-1 was attributed to the symmetrical stretching vibration of hydroxyl (-OH) formed
by physical adsorption of water molecules or ion exchange.
7. Application part is only emphasized in the manuscript.
In the practical application, MnOx has been extensively used in drinking water
treatment for the removal of iron and manganese. The degradation mechanism and
pathway of organic contaminants was seldom discussed, which would be the
theoretical basis for its application. And the next step was to explore that MnOx
degrade municipal wastewater under the research.
8. Significance of the material and its preliminary strong evidence for confirmation is
lagging thoroughly.
Beside XRD, we added FTIR into the manuscript to provide more info about the
material. The result of FTIR was followed by comment 6.
9. Conclusion is also being as lack of scientific summary of the entire manuscript.
The work was designed to investigate the oxidation property of MnOx for
environmental containments and its influenced factors. The conclusion was supported
by the following:
(1) the study of the full wavelength scanning found new absorption peaks, and the
characteristic absorption peaks of MB do not decrease proportionally;
(2) the concentration of Mn2+ in the sample was simultaneous increasing with MB
removal rate;
(3) the contribution of adsorption was only 0.36% of the total removal percentage
90.5% in low pH value;
(4) the results of LC-MS give a strong support to the chemical degradation of MB by
MnOx, and those intermediates were also checked.
10. Why does the reaction need low pH values?
For the Nernst equation MnO2+H+=Mn2++H2O, increasing the concentration of H+
would promote the reaction, which means that increasing the concentration of H+
would raise the oxidability of MnO2 and to degrade the contaminant. However, the
alkaline condition would restrain the redox reaction, which would be not conducive to
the containment removal.
11. Comparison of the results with earlier literature will make the article sensible.
The results of the article have been further revised under the earlier literatures.
After revision:
Page 5 in discussion part. Firstly, the value of pH would affect the surface charge of
MnOx and finally influences the removal behavior of MB on MnOx [51]. The zero
point charge (pHzpc) of MnOx was measured and shown in Fig. S2. When pH was
lower than 6.13, the surface charge of the MnOx was positive due to the protonation.
Then the adsorption could be held back by the electrostatic repulsion between the
cationic methylene blue (MB+) and the surface active sites of MnOx. When pH was
higher than 6.13, the surface of MnOx was negatively charged due to the
de-protonation reaction, which would lead to the formation of precursors between
MB+ and MnOx by a mutual attraction. However, the result showed that the removal
of MB by MnOx in acidic condition was much higher than that of alkaline condition.
In addition, a small amount of MB adsorbed to the surface of MnOx would
subsequently be rapidly transferred by oxidizing at low pH environment. As shown in
Fig 3b, the photo-spectra of the sample at pH 4 presented a blue shift after the
reaction with a decrement of the absorbance peak at 664 nm and an emerging peak at
605nm, which might belong to the intermediates from the degradation process [40,
52]. On the contrary, the absorbance peak patterns have not changed under alkaline
conditions for it would restrain the oxidicability of MnOx. A further proof came from
the increased concentration of Mn2+ with the removing of MB in reaction solution
(Fig. 4a) as a reduced product of MnOx.
Page 7 in conclusion part. Compared to other synthetic oxidants, Feton or ozone
technology, the current study demonstrates that this kind of natural manganese oxide
could be a potentially efficient low-cost oxidant for the degradation of methylene blue
in aqueous solution.
12. No new information could obtain from this manuscript.
The element Mn is an important participant involved in the earth biochemical cycle,
which is the second largest metal element after iron and possess high redox potential.
Abundant reserves of manganese ore have been surveyed on the earth's crust and
ocean. The manuscript reported have proved the degradability of natural manganese
ore for MB, and also revealed the mechanisms of MnOx degrading MB, which would
be theoretical significance for its application.
13. Reference style is very random and non-uniform. Make it in uniform order
corresponds to the journal reference style.
We have unified the format of reference.
