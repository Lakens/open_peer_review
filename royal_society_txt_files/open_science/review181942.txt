I salute you all on such an excellent contribution. The topic is so alluring and yet has received so
little attention. Thank you for sorting this out.
I do, of course, have a couple of suggestions.
First, please put more information into the abstract …give the numbers of bats tagged (8) and the
time spent in contact with them …… this will put the size of the data base in clear context and it
is appropriate to make it easier for the reader to get an idea of what is to come.
Second. Consider articulating the hypothesis that guided the work. I like the specific
predictions, but if they arose from a guiding hypothesis, the impact of the work would be clearer
to everyone. This will increase the impact and readership of the contribution.
Great work, lovely contribution

This paper describes the altitudinal movements of common noctule bats using pressure-sensitive
radio-transmitters. The study is very well-written, and it provides novel and valuable
information about how bats use the vertical dimension. The bats ascended briefly over 100 m in
most foraging sessions, but they stayed >1 minute above that height in only 2 of 25 observed
foraging sessions. The results made sense given what we know about how these bats forage. The
authors did not detect that the bats increased their wingbeats during these ascents, but the bats
did skip wingbeats and also glided. This information could be useful for informing policies for
3
mitigating bat mortality at wind turbines. It is also terrific to see what animals are doing in places
where we cannot normally observe them.
There were just a couple of places that I think the manuscript could be improved. First, it would
be nice to get a bit more detail of the accuracy of the tags (given the possible change of air
pressure caused by wingbeats). I suspect this information is somewhere and it would just be nice
to provide it for the reader since so much depends on a rough idea of their accuracy. One way to
do this (maybe) would be to put some standard-size error bars on the altitude data so one could
infer what is a bat moving up and down versus what is simply error. Or if the tags are high-
resolution enough, perhaps there would be no visible error bars?
Second, it would help to draw a better distinction between results of “no relationship” that the
authors think actually means a relationship of zero (biologically irrelevant) versus when “no
relationship” means something like “we detected no relationship probably due to a small effect
size and a lot of noise”. My line comments for each section are below. For more powerful
nonparametric tests, I provide some R code for an alternative to rank tests.
INTRO
First paragraph: Regarding the “aerosphere” niche, can you briefly clarify what you mean using
some concrete examples? Is an insect flying one foot above the ground in “airspace” or are we
only talking about very high up? (e.g. birds and bat feeding on migrating insects/birds/bats).
What is the difference between airspace and aerosphere? How high does it need to be?
50-53 Sentence needs revision.
69 Define “higher conflict zones”
77 missing parenthesis
126 bats at our study site
129 A bit confusing: the first part is the hypothesis, and the second part is the prediction? Maybe
reword as:
“If high-elevation ascents are a response to increased foraging effort, then ascents to higher
altitudes should be preceded by increased variation in altitude changes caused by the bat
searching for prey vertically.”
METHODS AND RESULTS
161 Can you briefly clarify how you measured the general foraging location? (e.g. using radio
signal strength to get distance and direction?)
168 “The transmitters had been previously calibrated for accuracy using the altimeter of a small
aircraft with r2 = 0.99 [38].” Can you give more information here? What is the scale or unit of
analysis for r2=0.99? Given the wingbeats affect on air pressure, what is the error bars (roughly
speaking) that are associated with altitude measures for a flying bat? For example, are these tags
accurate to 0.1 meter, 1 meter, 10 meter, 40 meters?
197 Sample size is 4546 air pressure measures?
Figure 1. This plot is your method for counting wingbeats? If so, maybe say that in Figure legend.
219 “we assume that flights with large changes in height indicate greater foraging effort.”
Does dropping in altitude also indicate foraging?
4
Figure 2. I think it would help to connect the dots with a line so we can see the variation over
time (or the error) more clearly, and to expand the x-axis and stack the plots in 4 rows. Figure 2
might be a good place to illustrate how you interpret the data. How many ascents are counted in
each panel?
Fig. 3A says “there are no differences” but the distributions looks different. By ranking the data,
you cannot detect that the high values are much higher in the descending rates, because the exact
values are lost. Data look lognormal, and might be better to visualize and analyze them after a log
transformation like log(x+1).
A nonsignificant test doesn’t show that two variables are similar or drawn from the same
distribution. So I think it’s better to say “no differences detected” rather than saying “the same”,
“no effect”, “no differences” or “no relationship” when not detecting a difference with low power
(unless the mean effect is precisely near zero). This also applied to lines 294, 302, or 305 and first
paragraph of discussion.
Many readers do know when to translate “no effect” as “inconclusive”, but many do not. If you
do think the effect is about zero, I think it makes sense to say “no effect” but then you should
present a near-zero effect size and confidence interval that is close around zero.
Also, I think ranked data tests like Mann-Whitney U tests are just too low power to argue
convincingly for differences or lack of differences between two groups. Below is some R code for
a more powerful non-parametric permutation test that can be used of Mann-Whitney instead to
test differences between two means drawn from any distribution.
I think the Figure 4 caption (line 285 or 286) is missing some words (e.g. “are shown”)
Besides my comment above about “no relationship” vs “not detecting a relationship” , the
discussion reads well to me.

or unit of analysis for r2=0.99? Given the wingbeats affect on
air pressure, what is the error bars (roughly speaking) that
are associated with altitude measures for a flying bat? For
example, are these tags accurate to 0.1 meter, 1 meter, 10
meter, 40 meters?
>This was an altitude-altitude calibration (L182). Tag
sensitivity has been included at L177 and the error of each
measurement is so small that visualizing it on the scales of
our figures would not be productive.
Also, while it is possible that wing movements of the bat
could impact air pressure, this is so small (bat wingbeats are
relatively low power) that it can be ignored.
197 Sample size is 4546 air pressure measures?

Figure 1. This plot is your method for counting wingbeats? If
so, maybe say that in Figure legend.

219 “we assume that flights with large changes in height
indicate greater foraging effort.”
Does dropping in altitude also indicate foraging?
>We assume yes.
Figure 2. I think it would help to connect the dots with a line
so we can see the variation over time (or the error) more
clearly, and to expand the x-axis and stack the plots in 4
rows. Figure 2 might be a good place to illustrate how you
interpret the data. How many ascents are counted in each
panel?
> We have re-formatted to stack the panels vertically and
provided a bit more interpretation in the text.
Fig. 3A says “there are no differences” but the distributions
looks different. By ranking the data, you cannot detect that
the high values are much higher in the descending rates,
because the exact values are lost. Data look lognormal, and
might be better to visualize and analyze them after a log
transformation like log(x+1).
A nonsignificant test doesn’t show that two variables are
similar or drawn from the same distribution. So I think it’s
better to say “no differences detected” rather than saying
“the same”, “no effect”, “no differences” or “no relationship”
when not detecting a difference with low power (unless the
mean effect is precisely near zero). This also applied to lines
294, 302, or 305 and first paragraph of discussion.
Many readers do know when to translate “no effect” as
“inconclusive”, but many do not. If you do think the effect is
about zero, I think it makes sense to say “no effect” but then
you should present a near-zero effect size and confidence
interval that is close around zero.
Also, I think ranked data tests like Mann-Whitney U tests are
just too low power to argue convincingly for differences or
lack of differences between two groups. Below is some R
code for a more powerful non-parametric permutation test
that can be used of Mann-Whitney instead to test differences
between two means drawn from any distribution.
> We have rephrased accordingly & used Gerry’s suggested
permutation test – we agree about the low power, but as a
first approximation it’s not a bad start. Thanks for including
the code! We’ve detected differences in means that were not
immediately detectable before but are line with what one
would predict.
I think the Figure 4 caption (line 285 or 286) is missing some
words (e.g. “are shown”)
> Corrected
Besides my comment above about “no relationship” vs “not
detecting a relationship” , the discussion reads well to me.
