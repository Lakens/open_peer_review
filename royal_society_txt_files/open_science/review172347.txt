Niamh Moran and colleagues report that regions from peptides derived from the juxtamembrane
domains (JMD) of the E- and N-cadherin proteins inhibit platelet function. Upon bioinformatics
and experimental analyses, the authors found that a motif 756-KEPLLP-763, within JMD, inhibits
platelet function. Furthermore, K756, L761, and L762 are critical for peptide activity.
The manuscript is well written and organized. It is quite interesting the finding that the KEPLLP
sequence shows inhibition of platelet aggregation and inhibition of ATP secretion. However, I
have some questions and concerns as indicated below:
Major comments:
1. Fig. 2 shows the inhibitory effect of the E- and N-cadherin-derived peptides in ATP secretion.
Have the authors seen any effect of peptides without palmitoylation?
2. I disagree with the title of the section that describes Fig. 2. Peptides seem to inhibit ATP
secretion only. The authors have not looked at, for example, alpha granule secretion too.
3. Data obtained in Fig. 4 and 5 should be compared against scrambled peptides to validate
specificity.
4. Have the authors evaluated the activity of the KEPLLP peptide (let's say at 12.5 uM) over the
time to see stability and efficacy in both inhibition of platelet aggregation and ATP secretion?
5. The peptides are, in principle, unable to penetrate the platelet membrane unless there is a
mechanism o internalization of them. Therefore, the peptides will not be able to interact with
P120 catenin. What is the purpose of showing the presence of P120 catenin in the WB of Fig. 5C?
6. The hypothesis regarding how the peptide acts on E-cadherin internalization is interesting.
However, how this relates with the inhibition of platelet aggregation and the inhibition of ATP
secretion?
Minor comments:
1. The role of K-cadherin in platelet function is mentioned twice in page 4 (Introduction). Please
edit the text accordingly.

The manuscript describes the activity of cadherin-derived peptides in platelets. The authors
demonstrate that cadherin peptides inhibit the activation of platelet induced by the thrombin
receptor activating peptide (TRAP). They demonstrated that the C-terminus residues of the E-cad
2 peptide critical for the inhibitory properties and they identify the smallest peptide sequence
requirement for the inhibition of the platelet inhibitory activity. The results are interesting for the
increased knowledge of the role of cadherin in the platelet function as well as for the
development of anti-thrombotic compounds. In a previous manuscript from the same authors
[ref. 16] investigated the role of cadherin-derived peptides in TGF-beta response in epithelial
cells. The paper is concise and well written.
There are a few small suggestions.
Page 8 at the end of the page the authors indicate that “Similar peptides were able to block TGF-
beta 1 induced gene expression in epithelial cells”, I believe they can say “The same peptides are
able to block….” as I cannot see any difference between the peptides studied in the previous
paper and the actual manuscript.
Page 14, second phrase at the discussion the author say “We synthesized overlapping …” but in
page 6 under Materials they say that “Peptide were custom synthesized by a company”. Also
they say that the peptides were synthesized as previously described [ref 16] and ref 16 does not
contain any description of the synthesis and characterization. If the authors want to provide
information of the synthesis of peptides the information or the source of information should be
accurate. They can include details on purity (they say 90% pure) and characterization data (MS)
in the supplementary section.
Figure 1. The authors can include the formula of Ttds linker and Palmitamide
Figure 2. Please define PAL-NH2 (Most probably is Hexadecanamide or Palmitamide or Palmitic
amide).
In Figures 3, 4 and 5 the authors introduce several peptide series in order to localize the bioactive
residues of the most active E-cad 2 and N-cad 1 peptides. Figure 3 have 12 new peptides; Figure 4
has 12 new peptides and Figure 5 has 10-11 new peptides. There is no enough information
regarding the chemical entity of the novel peptides. Are all of these peptides palmitoylated at the
N-terminus and amide peptides at the C-terminal position? It will be nice to have all this
information at least in the figure legend.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors report that peptides from the JMD of E- and N-cadherins exert sequence-specific
inhibitory activity on TRAP-activated human platelets, which was primarily mapped to a
KEPLLP motif. The experiments appear to have been performed with care and yielded
convincing results. The following may, however, require further attention.
1. The authors suggest that E-cad 2 peptide may mimic the p120-catenin binding region to inhibit
platelet function. Testing the inhibitory action of this peptide against platelet agonists other than
TRAP could lend additional support to this notion.
2. Would KEPLLP preserve surface expression of E-cadherin following platelet activation?
3. The Student`s t test is inappropriate to perform multiple comparisons. Description of statistical
analysis should be included. How was the normality of data (a prerequisite for the Student`s t
test) tested at n=3?

Response to reviews:
The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their time and
comments. We have made suggested changes to the manuscript to
address the reviewers concern. Below are detailed responses to each
comment. The reviewer’s comments are in bold and our responses are
found in normal text.
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Niamh Moran and colleagues report that regions from peptides derived
from the juxtamembrane domains (JMD) of the E- and N-cadherin
proteins inhibit platelet function. Upon bioinformatics and experimental
analyses, the authors found that a motif 756-KEPLLP-763, within JMD,
inhibits platelet function. Furthermore, K756, L761, and L762 are
critical for peptide activity.
The manuscript is well written and organized. It is quite interesting the
finding that the KEPLLP sequence shows inhibition of platelet
aggregation and inhibition of ATP secretion. However, I have some
questions and concerns as indicated below:
Major comments:
1. Fig. 2 shows the inhibitory effect of the E- and N-cadherin-
derived peptides in ATP secretion. Have the authors seen any
effect of peptides without palmitoylation?
Response: We include additional results showing the effect of non-
palmitoylated KEPPLP peptide on TRAP induced platelet secretion.
We inserted data showing that non-palmitoylated peptide fails to have
any effect on TRAP-induced ATP secretion (Supplemental figure IV).
We have added the following text on page 13:
“To further confirm the specificity of KEPLLP peptide activity, we
tested the effect of peptide with no palmitoylation. Non-palmitoylated
KEPLLP peptide fail to inhibit the TRAP induced platelet ATP secretion
(Supplemental figure IV). This suggests that palmitoylation is
necessary to direct the peptide towards the cell membrane”.
2. I disagree with the title of the section that describes Fig. 2.
Peptides seem to inhibit ATP secretion only. The authors have
not looked at, for example, alpha granule secretion too.
Response: We agree with reviewer that our peptides inhibit ATP
secretion which is a marker for platelet dense granule secretion. We
have edited text accordingly in page 10 and 11, as follows: The title of
the section is now “Cadherin peptides inhibit Thrombin receptor
activating peptide (TRAP) induced platelet ATP secretion”
In addition, we added the following information “Having established the
effects on ATP secretion of the E-cad 2 and N-cad 1peptides, we then
additionally tested their ability to alter the adhesion of platelets to
immobilized fibrinogen. Platelets treated with E-cad 2 and N-cad 1
peptides were fail to adhere to immobilized fibrinogen, suggesting that
these peptides could affect platelet function other than ATP secretion
(Supplemental figure III)”.
3. Data obtained in Fig. 4 and 5 should be compared against
scrambled peptides to validate specificity.
Response: We compared parent peptide data against scrambled
peptide as per suggestion. We inserted new text on page 15 that
performs the comparison requested: “In addition, we synthesized the
randomly scrambled peptide (PLLPKE) along with a peptide which
reversed the charges of the two N-terminal residues (EKPLLP). The
EKPLLP peptide retain partial inhibitory activity (Fig 5B). This is not
surprising, since EKPLLP peptide still has a positive charged residue
at its N-terminus. However, the fully scrambled PLLPKE peptide failed
to inhibit platelet ATP secretion in response to TRAP (Fig. 5B)”. We
inserted following text figure 5’s legend: “Significance was compared to
scrambled peptide (PLLPKE) vs each individual peptide treatment”.
4. Have the authors evaluated the activity of the KEPLLP peptide
(let's say at 12.5 uM) over the time to see stability and efficacy in
both inhibition of platelet aggregation and ATP secretion?
Response: We present additional data regarding a longer time period
where we observed inhibition of TRAP induced platelet ATP secretion
following 1hr incubation with peptides and included these results as
Supplemental figure II in the manuscript. We inserted the following text
in page 11:
“Longer incubation of E-cad 2 and N-cad 1 (for 1hr prior to TRAP
stimulation) did not affect the peptide activity (Supplemental figure II)”.
Thus, we can see no appreciable decline in efficacy but cannot
comment on the stability as we were not able to measure the peptide
levels.
5. The peptides are, in principle, unable to penetrate the platelet
membrane unless there is a mechanism o internalization of them.
Therefore, the peptides will not be able to interact with P120
catenin. What is the purpose of showing the presence of P120
catenin in the WB of Fig. 5C?
Response: To clarify our rationale, previous studies (Koloka et.al. 2008
Platelets, 19:7, 502-511, DOI: 10.1080/09537100802266875;
Stephens. et.al 1998 JBC doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.32.20317 August 7,
1998) have demonstrated that palmitoylated peptides are likely to be
delivered to the internal side of the platelet membrane, where they may
interact with proteins. It is assumed that the palmitoyl remains
embedded in the membrane, and the peptide therefore is anchored.
Our peptides are derived from the E-cadherin juxtamembrane region
which can bind to P120-catenin, and we speculate that our peptides
interfere with E-cadherin and P120-catenin interaction to alter platelet
function. However, they will not be able to that if p120 catenin is not
present at appreciable levels in the platelet, and Fig 5C is simply a
check that p120 is present in both the resting and activated platelets.
We have revised our text as follows (end of results):
“Of relevance, we identified expression of P120-catenin in both resting
and TRAP activated platelet lysates (Fig. 5C), indicating that the most
likely interaction partner of the KEPLLP peptide is indeed present and
available for interaction.”
6. The hypothesis regarding how the peptide acts on E-cadherin
internalization is interesting. However, how this relates with the
inhibition of platelet aggregation and the inhibition of ATP
secretion?
Response:
We have added the following text to the discussion in response to the
reviewer’s query:
“Adhesion molecules not only participate in regulation of cell junctions
but are also involved in intracellular signaling. E-cadherin cross-talks
with integrins in the progression of cancer, via several signaling
molecules including Src, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Rho-family
of GTPases. P120-catenin is a key molecule for E-cadherin function
and plays a role in the regulation of Rho-GTPases, which are involved
in platelet function. Interruption of E-cadherin/P120-catenin in platelets
using the palmitoylated peptide derived from E-cadherin
juxtamembrane domain could affect key signaling molecules involved
platelet secretion and aggregation.”
Minor comments:
1. The role of K-cadherin in platelet function is mentioned twice in
page 4 (Introduction). Please edit the text accordingly.
Edited the introduction accordingly in page 4 (Introduction).

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript describes the activity of cadherin-derived
peptides in platelets. The authors demonstrate that cadherin
peptides inhibit the activation of platelet induced by the thrombin
receptor activating peptide (TRAP). They demonstrated that the C-
terminus residues of the E-cad 2 peptide critical for the inhibitory
properties and they identify the smallest peptide sequence
requirement for the inhibition of the platelet inhibitory activity.
The results are interesting for the increased knowledge of the role
of cadherin in the platelet function as well as for the development
of anti-thrombotic compounds. In a previous manuscript from the
same authors [ref. 16] investigated the role of cadherin-derived
peptides in TGF-beta response in epithelial cells. The paper is
concise and well written.
There are a few small suggestions.
Response: We thank the reviewer for positive feedback and
suggestions.
Page 8 at the end of the page the authors indicate that “Similar
peptides were able to block TGF-beta 1 induced gene expression
in epithelial cells”, I believe they can say “The same peptides are
able to block….” as I cannot see any difference between the
peptides studied in the previous paper and the actual
manuscript.
Response: We agree with reviewer and changed text accordingly in
page 9.
Page 14, second phrase at the discussion the author say “We
synthesized overlapping …” but in page 6 under Materials they
say that “Peptide were custom synthesized by a company”. Also
they say that the peptides were synthesized as previously
described [ref 16] and ref 16 does not contain any description of
the synthesis and characterization. If the authors want to provide
information of the synthesis of peptides the information or the
source of information should be accurate. They can include
details on purity (they say 90% pure) and characterization data
(MS) in the supplementary section.
Response: We are apologise for the confusion. Peptides in this study
were custom synthesized by a company Peptide 2.0, USA. We have
changed the text accordingly in page 16, to read:
Purity for our peptides have now been included in the manuscript as
supplementary table I. As an example, we included MS data of
KEPLLP peptide.
Figure 1. The authors can include the formula of Ttds linker and
Palmitamide
Response: We have included the formula as per reviewer’s suggestion
in figure legend 1 in page 21.
Figure 2. Please define PAL-NH2 (Most probably is
Hexadecanamide or Palmitamide or Palmitic amide).
Response: We included definition of “Palmitic amide (PAL-NH2)” in
figure legend 2.
In Figures 3, 4 and 5 the authors introduce several peptide series
in order to localize the bioactive residues of the most active E-cad
2 and N-cad 1 peptides. Figure 3 have 12 new peptides; Figure 4
has 12 new peptides and Figure 5 has 10-11 new peptides. There
is no enough information regarding the chemical entity of the
novel peptides. Are all of these peptides palmitoylated at the N-
terminus and amide peptides at the C-terminal position? It will be
nice to have all this information at least in the figure legend.
Response: We thank reviewers for pointing this out for us. We edited
legends of figure 3, 4 and 5 with details of peptides saying that “all
peptides are N-terminally palmitoylated and C-terminally amidated”.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors report that peptides from the JMD of E- and N-
cadherins exert sequence-specific inhibitory activity on TRAP-
activated human platelets, which was primarily mapped to a
KEPLLP motif. The experiments appear to have been performed
with care and yielded convincing results. The following may,
however, require further attention.
We appreciate the reviewer’s feedback and helpful comments. We
addressed the reviewer’s comments to make further changes, as
follows.
1. The authors suggest that E-cad 2 peptide may mimic the p120-
catenin binding region to inhibit platelet function. Testing the
inhibitory action of this peptide against platelet agonists other
than TRAP could lend additional support to this notion.
Response: We included an assay of peptide inhibition of platelets to
fibrinogen in the methods section, as a figure in Supplemental figure
III, and we included interpretation of these results as follows on page
11:
“Having established the effects on ATP secretion of the E-cad 2 and
N-cad 1 peptides, we then additionally tested their ability to alter the
adhesion of platelets to immobilized fibrinogen. Platelets treated with
E-cad 2 and N-cad 1 peptide inhibited the adherence to immobilized
fibrinogen. This indicates that the effects of these peptides are not
limited to the alteration of ATP secretion.”
2. Would KEPLLP preserve surface expression of E-cadherin
following platelet activation?
Response: We thank reviewer for this valuable question. We have
included the following in the discussion:
“The KEPLLP peptide may well alter the distribution of E-cadherin and
p120-catenin in the platelet on activation, and it will be of interest to
determine if either of these proteins show substantial alterations in
abundance or in their surface or internal localization, following peptide
inhibition.”
3. The Student`s t test is inappropriate to perform multiple
comparisons. Description of statistical analysis should be
included. How was the normality of data (a prerequisite for the
Student`s t test) tested at n=3?
Response: We apologise for confusion. To clarify, statistical
significance was compared between TRAP alone or
TRAP+0.5%DMSO (vehicle control) vs each individual peptide
treatment. To address this, we have included the following text in the
methods section which describes the statistical analysis:
“Data was analyzed using Graph Pad Prism 6. Data represented as
±S.E.M of individual donors. Significance was compared between each
treatment of peptide+TRAP vs TRAP alone or TRAP +0.5%DMSO
(vehicle control) using student’s t-test. For KEPLLP control peptides
(Fig. 5B) significance was compared between scrambled peptide vs
each individual peptide treatment.”

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have addressed my previous concerns, and he revision has
further strengthened this manuscript. However, one issue require further
attention.
Please indicate how did you assess the normality of your data (a
prerequisite for the Student's t test) at n=3-4. Please also check spelling

Response: We apologies for confusion. For data in our study we used
Student’s t-test to perform multiple comparisons. Student’s t-test in
appropriate to perform multiple comparisons. Therefore, we reanalyzed our
data using One-wayANOVA, which suitable for multiple comparisons. We
made following change in statistical analysis in methods section.
“Significance was compared between each treatment of peptide+TRAP vs
TRAP alone or TRAP+DMSO (vehicle control) using one-way ANOVA
(Tukey's multiple comparisons test)”.
