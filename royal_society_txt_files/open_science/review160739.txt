Dear Authors:
I appreciated the opportunity to read this manuscript and to review this study. Overall, this
examining pedestrian safety and behavior differences between countries is a potentially
interesting area to help assess differing rates of pedestrian injuries and to examine potential
cultural factors, as indicated. I have several critiques and suggestions that I believe should be
addressed:
Abstract
1) I would suggest including quantitative findings here rather than only qualitative
descriptions of such findings.
2) Is this really the first study to examine culture on pedestrian crossing behavior, as
stated? Perhaps specifically on social information, but it seems a bit misleading to state this
considering that these data appear to have been used to answer a different, but similar, study
questions previously.
Introduction
3) There are many close similarities in the text of this section to the previous manuscript
(reference 16). I believe it would be beneficial to differentiate this manuscript as much as possible
from that previous manuscript.
4) I disagree with Page 3, line 47 where it is stated that walking is a “high-risk behaviour.”
Walking is not high risk, but the circumstances, environment, and types of road use behaviors
(both pedestrians and drivers) can make it high risk. Considering how many times people cross
the road without getting struck by a vehicle, even despite risky behaviors, demonstrates walking
is a normally safe behavior. Even examining the rate of pedestrian injury per population it is a
rare occurrence (<20 fatalities per 100,000 population/year in most countries & <10 fatalities per
100 million person-trips/year), though it can result in terrible, yet avoidable, consequences. I do
agree that the most of the risk occurs when crossing the road, however.
5) Page 4, lines 55-57: I think this statement is setting up a false dichotomy. Pedestrian can
cross the road quickly and safely; it does not have to be one or the other. If this is being set up to
contrast green (safely) and red (quickly) crossings, then that is incorrect. Many pedestrians are
even struck in green due to turning conflicts (and some driver red-light runners), both by right
and left turners, thus even a green crossing is not completely safe. I would say the decision comes
down more to waiting or not waiting and evaluating the time/cost/safety benefit of each of
those.
6) Please define informational cascades & amplification processes. While it can be intuited
what these refer to, based on their context, they are not explicitly defined.
Methods
7) Please describe study data, sites, time (years), etc. Assuming these data are the same
from the previous publication (ref 16), then please add that as a reference and provide a brief
description in this manuscript.
8) DOI for data do not appear to exist
9) Crossing against the red light: it is somewhat hard to follow exactly how these were
identified based on the information provided. A schematic/diagram of the logic for eligibility for
analysis would be helpful. It seems like there may be some conflicting information, e.g.: Line 175
vs line 176-177. Was collective crossing during only reds or greens or both?
3
10) Line 177-178: Why less than the mean? It seems it should be defined more about
distance/visibility of the leading pedestrian to the following pedestrians to get at social cues &
influence rather than just a cutoff time.
11) Line 187: by the first 10 pedestrians, is it meant the first 10 pedestrians after each initial
pedestrian crossing against red are analyzed?
12) Did statistical analyses use clustering of any sort? Observations at each location and
within country are not independent, thus clustering should be included within the analysis. A
multilevel/hierarchical/random effects model could be considered, though there may not be
enough clusters to be worth doing that.
Results
13) Results are difficult to follow since there are no tables containing them to present them in
an organized fashion
Discussion
14) I think making the leap between different countries meaning there are cultural influences
on road crossing behaviors may be a bit too far based on the study design. I believe it would be
better to stick with the difference by country and suggest that perhaps these are a reflection of
different cultures rather than a statement of fact (line 426). I think more would need to be done to
measure road design differences, identifying measureable cultural behaviors, and getting a larger
sample would be important. Some qualitative work assessing perspectives on some of the
behaviors observed may be helpful as well to get some context (in a future study, of course).

I find your results quite interesting, especially the fact that people in Japan and in France behave
so differently, it seems. But, as a skeptic, I must ask, is it differences between the people of the
countries or differences in roadway and control design that differ? As a start, you need to
describe what ‘green’ pedestrian light means. Is that an exclusive phase with no turning vehicles
crossing the crosswalk? If there are turning vehicles, pedestrians may not be that much safer
4
during the green phase than they are during the red phase during times when there are no
vehicles approaching. You discuss the time from previous vehicle passage, but I did not read
about time (in seconds) until next vehicle is arriving.
I have lived roughly half my life in Sweden and half my life in the USA. In Sweden, if a
pedestrian calls for green (push button), most signals immediately give them green, and at most
locations there are no gaps to jaywalk in until the green light (or just before it). In the US, the
situation is typically the opposite, if you push the button, you still have to wait a minute or two
even if there are no cars approaching and once you get the walk light there will typically be
turning vehicles crossing all [4] crosswalks at an intersection since right-turn-on-red is the norm.
In the US, it is definitely safer to cross during red if there are no cars within sight distance than
wait for green and cross when there are stopped cars around that may start up at any time. I do
not know if France and Japan see similar differences since I have never been to Japan and spent
only limited time in France. And, even in Sweden, turning cars vs green walking pedestrians are
involved in more pedestrian crashes than red-walking pedestrians are except for in Stockholm,
the biggest city in Sweden. Well, those results are old and may no longer be quite accurate. They
are from my own research as discussed in the next paragraph.
Since this journal recommends non-blind reviews, I will go into my own research. Back
in 1989, I published a paper in Accident Analysis and Prevention called Pedestrian safety at
Traffic Signals: A study Carried out with the Help of a Traffic Conflict Technique (by Per Gårder).
One part of that paper (Section 7. The Influence of Various Factors on the Percentage of
Pedestrians Crossing on Red) discusses red-light walking. In that study, I found that people in
bigger cities jaywalk (walk against red) much more than in smaller towns. And, like you, I found
that refuge islands increase the rate by 5.4 percentage points. But unlike you, I still concluded that
refuge islands make it significantly safer for pedestrians to cross streets. I also found that bad
weather increases jaywalking and, like you, that long wait times increase jaywalking, at least
some. For every second longer red time, jaywalking increased by 0.017%. I also found that men
walk against red about 40% more than women and that young men do it three times more than
the average pedestrian, so many of your results are supported by my studies. And I reference
studies that the risk may be 20 times greater for red walkers than green walkers. (Cameron,
Stanton and Milne 1976). However, I am also aware of the fact that a pedestrian may be at higher
risk if walking with the light both in the beginning of a walk phase and throughout the phase
when turning cars have high speeds than if they walk against the red light at times when there
are no cars around.
You write that French pedestrians cross against the lights much more often (41.9%) than Japanese
(2.1%). It would be interesting to know what percentage walk against red of those arriving during
red (the don’t walk phase) (rather than of all pedestrians). This number may in France be as high
as 99% of those arriving when there is a red light. Can you give that number.
You write, “Twice as many pedestrians followed another crossing against the red light in France
as in Japan” This surprises me. If only 2.1% cross on red and we assume that it is red half the
time, than 4 out of 100 coming to red cross on red in Japan. And fewer than half is following
someone, so fewer than 2 in 100 follow someone. If that number is double in France, fewer than 4
out of a hundred would follow someone. That seems impossible if we have roughly 80% going
against red and 20% waiting for green (again, if it is green half the time). Please explain.
You write in the abstract, “However, Japanese pedestrians are less influenced by social
information, as fewer of them followed others crossing at the red light and those who did so
crossed faster, indicating their risk awareness.” Why is that ‘less’ influenced? It seems like only
about half of French pedestrians followed the others’ lead [or much fewer according to my
discussion in the paragraph above] whereas a vast majority of Japanese pedestrians did what
their fellow citizens did, that is if someone else was waiting, they also decided to wait, since
97.9% did not cross on red. To make your point, you will need to show separate numbers for
French and Japanese pedestrian behavior of what happens when one person jaywalks versus
5
when all previously arrived pedestrians are waiting. And, then you need to control that for the
influence of traffic volume (gaps) and possibly speed, etc. And, you do some of that in the main
text.
“The number of lanes increased the acceptable distance of the next car for pedestrians, but they
considered the safe distance to be shorter when in the presence of pedestrian refuge island
[28,30]. This kind of infrastructure may therefore be advantageous in so far that it prevents
accidents but could also encourage pedestrians to cross against the light and increase this
behaviour. A compromise needs to be found in order to know when and where these pedestrian
refuges should be built.” I believe that people who are in a great hurry are the most likely to cross
during the red phase, and are also the most likely to be hit (exempting intoxicated people who are
at even greater risk). These people in a hurry benefit from refuge islands more than other people
lose from them in safety. This is speculation by me, but I urge you to not recommend cities to
stop building refuge islands. Many evaluations show that the actual number of pedestrian
crashes are cut in half or more by their existence.
“This means that the number of pedestrians crossing against the red light is much lower when
other pedestrians are present … indicating a strong social influence” Yes, probably that people do
not want to be bad role models, especially in front of children. Also, if jaywalking is illegal and
enforced, people will think there is a higher risk of being fined if there are other humans around.
The English is very good, but a few sentences need to be fixed, such as “Men were also started
crossing sooner than women…” and “a decrease in the number of accidents could be attained
through a better understanding how human beings behave…” changed to “Men also started
crossing sooner than women…” and “a decrease in the number of accidents could be attained
through a better understanding of how human beings behave…”
Finally, you discuss the animal ‘humans’ and primates. You could also discuss Raccoons living in
big North American cities. I read in (I think) the National Geographic magazine many years ago
that mothers teach their children (offspring) to wait until there are no vehicles close by, and then
when she crosses, the children follow just behind, something she learned from her mother. Then
they run across as fast as possible to avoid getting hit in the ‘last’ lane. Also, their territories are
usually delineated by arterials, so they never cross the big streets.

Dear Authors:
Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript again. I believe you have responded to
my critiques from the first review quite thoroughly.
My only remaining comment is regarding my previous critique #12 about the need for clustering.
By clustering I was referring to clustering and correlated data I was referring to individual
observations being related to one another within a location and a country rather than collinearity
between variables. This type of correlation needs to be accounted for by clustering in the
estimates of the standard error or in multilevel/hierarchical models (e.g., generalized estimating
equations or generalized linear mixed models).

Dear Authors:
Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript again. I believe you have responded to
my critiques from the first review quite thoroughly.
My only remaining comment is regarding my previous critique #12 about the need for clustering.
By clustering I was referring to clustering and correlated data I was referring to individual
14
observations being related to one another within a location and a country rather than collinearity
between variables. This type of correlation needs to be accounted for by clustering in the
estimates of the standard error or in multilevel/hierarchical models (e.g., generalized estimating
equations or generalized linear mixed models).

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Dear Authors:
appreciated the opportunity to read this manuscript and to review this study. Overall,
his examining pedestrian safety and behavior differences between countries is a
potentially interesting area to help assess differing rates of pedestrian injuries and to
examine potential cultural factors, as indicated.
Thank you very much for these comments. We tried to answer all your comments in a
positive manner, and we hope that you will find this revision satisfactory.
have several critiques and suggestions that I believe should be addressed:
Abstract
1) I would suggest including quantitative findings here rather than only qualitative
descriptions of such findings.
We have added some quantitative findings to the abstract in this new version of the
manuscript: “Individuals deciding to cross the road were strongly influenced by the
behaviour and the presence of other pedestrians, especially in Japan, where a stronger
conformism was noted. However, Japanese pedestrians were half as likely to be
nfluenced by social information as their French counterparts when crossing at the red
ight, as they were more respectful of rules. Men show riskier behaviour than women
(40.6% vs. 25.7% of rule-breaking, respectively).” Lines 20-26
2) Is this really the first study to examine culture on pedestrian crossing behavior, as
stated? Perhaps specifically on social information, but it seems a bit misleading to state
his considering that these data appear to have been used to answer a different, but
similar, study questions previously.
We have removed this claim from the manuscript.
ntroduction
3) There are many close similarities in the text of this section to the previous
manuscript (reference 16). I believe it would be beneficial to differentiate this
manuscript as much as possible from that previous manuscript.
This was not intentional; we did refer to oour former paper when writing this
manuscript. It is relatively difficult to change this text, as the factors affecting crossing a
road alone or in group are more or less identical. We have however changed some parts
of the introduction to differentiate this manuscript as much as possible from that of
previous manuscript.
4) I disagree with Page 3, line 47 where it is stated that walking is a “high-risk
behaviour.” Walking is not high risk, but the circumstances, environment, and types of
road use behaviors (both pedestrians and drivers) can make it high risk. Considering
how many times people cross the road without getting struck by a vehicle, even despite
risky behaviors, demonstrates walking is a normally safe behavior. Even examining the
rate of pedestrian injury per population it is a rare occurrence (<20 fatalities per
100,000 population/year in most countries & <10 fatalities per 100 million person-
rips/year), though it can result in terrible, yet avoidable, consequences. I do agree that
he most of the risk occurs when crossing the road, however.
We agreed with you. We have changed the sentence, which now reads as follows:
Walking in the street is a daily necessity for the majority of humans. Although walking
can be considered a safe behaviour in light of the number of times people cross the road
without getting struck by a vehicle, the circumstances, environment, and types of road
use behaviours (both pedestrians and drivers) can make it a high-risk behaviour.”, lines
46-49.
5) Page 4, lines 55-57: I think this statement is setting up a false dichotomy.
Pedestrian can cross the road quickly and safely; it does not have to be one or the other.
f this is being set up to contrast green (safely) and red (quickly) crossings, then that is
ncorrect. Many pedestrians are even struck in green due to turning conflicts (and some
driver red-light runners), both by right and left turners, thus even a green crossing is not
completely safe. I would say the decision comes down more to waiting or not waiting
and evaluating the time/cost/safety benefit of each of those.
We did not write in a correct way the sentence. We thought about the time to take a
decision and not to cross. We changed the sentence as well: “The faster a pedestrian
decides to cross, the riskier the decision will be, as the pedestrian takes less time to
obtain information before stepping off the kerb. ”, Lines 57-58.
6) Please define informational cascades & amplification processes. While it can be
ntuited what these refer to, based on their context, they are not explicitly defined.
We have added the following definitions: “An information cascade occurs when a
pedestrian observes the actions of others and then, despite possible contradictions in
his/her personal information, does likewise, i.e. crosses the road. The amplification
process is quite similar, except that in this case the probability to cross increases with
he number of individuals crossing. Therefore, even if their decision is wrong, the more
ndividuals are already crossing, the more likely it is that the remaining individuals will
ollow them.” Lines 67-72.
Methods
7) Please describe study data, sites, time (years), etc. Assuming these data are the
same from the previous publication (ref 16), then please add that as a reference and
provide a brief description in this manuscript.
Table 1. We have added more details about the sites. We have also added more details to
he “Study sites” section: “We observed pedestrian behaviours on three sites in
Strasbourg, France and on four sites in Nagoya, Japan. Details about each site are given
n Table 1. Pictures for each site are available on the supplementary information file and
n Google View ®. These sites all permitted the observation of collective road crossings
nvolving at least 10 pedestrians at a time. The speed of vehicles on each site was limited
o 50km/h. There was no difference in pedestrian crossing speed between the sites
(Permutation test for independent samples: maxT = 2.22, p = 0.168). At some sites,
vehicles were allowed to turn left or right despite the green light for pedestrians, but the
drivers were aware that crossing pedestrians had priority. Moreover, turning vehicles
ravel much slower than vehicles that are heading straight on. However, the driver of an
approaching vehicle may be less careful if pedestrians cross at the red light, as he/she
has the right to pass. The risk to pedestrians is therefore much higher when crossing at
he red light. There was no button for pedestrians to trigger the green light at any of the
sites studied.” Lines 132-143.
Finally, we have provided pictures of the sites in the Supplementary Information
section.
8) DOI for data do not appear to exist
This is correct. The DOi will not be functional until the paper is accepted: “Citation is not
yet available for this publication from Royal Society Open Science. It will become available
shortly after the publication appears. »
However, we have modified the address to make it more precise:
http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.tc365
9) Crossing against the red light: it is somewhat hard to follow exactly how these
were identified based on the information provided. A schematic/diagram of the logic for
eligibility for analysis would be helpful. It seems like there may be some conflicting
nformation, e.g.: Line 175 vs line 176-177. Was collective crossing during only reds or
greens or both?
We understand your concern. We have added a paragraph to make this clearer: “Of
course, collective road –crossing can involve crossing at the red light - the two
behaviours are not exclusive. In the first case, i.e. crossing at the red light, we wanted to
analyse the individual rule-breaking behaviour independently of collective behaviours,
whilst in the second part, i.e. “collective road-crossing”, we aimed to analyse the
collective processes and identify the influencing an individual’s decision to follow others
across the road at a green or red light.” Lines 178-182.
We have also modified certain sentences and have added a new one in the following
paragraph in order to avoid any misunderstanding: “We scored the behaviours of
pedestrians during collective crossings, which were defined as those involving two or
more pedestrians at the green light (occurring without prior jaywalking by pedestrians)
or at the red light, when the time between the departures of the two pedestrians was
ower than the mean road crossing time indicated in Table 1 for each site. Any collective
road crossings in which pedestrians crossing at the red light were immediately followed
specific cases it is impossible to confirm whether pedestrians crossing at the green light
were influenced by the pedestrians crossing against the red light. We then separated
collective crossings at the green light from collective crossings at the red light.” Lines
191-200
10) Line 177-178: Why less than the mean? It seems it should be defined more about
distance/visibility of the leading pedestrian to the following pedestrians to get at social
cues & influence rather than just a cutoff time.
You are right. At the beginning of the study, we also wanted criterion for visibility
and/or distance. Pedestrians who crossed were still visible from at least 10 times the
width of the road by pedestrians waiting to cross. We therefore decided to take the
mean time to cross as a proxy of the distance. Moreover, data analysis required time
rather than distance.
11) Line 187: by the first 10 pedestrians, is it meant the first 10 pedestrians after
each initial pedestrian crossing against red are analyzed?
Yes. We analysed the first ten pedestrians’ behaviours, both at the red and the green
ights. We have added this detail on line 204.
12) Did statistical analyses use clustering of any sort? Observations at each location
and within country are not independent, thus clustering should be included within the
analysis. A multilevel/hierarchical/random effects model could be considered, though
here may not be enough clusters to be worth doing that.
We checked before making our analyses whether the data were correlated/collinear
hrough the VIF (Variance Inflation Factor). This is already indicated in the manuscript,
ines 256-261. Moreover, we tested all possible models to check for possible co-
nfluences of the independent factors (multi-inference models and model selection), as
we also tested models with interactions to check how some factors influence the results
and impacts of others. We have added this detail in the statistical analyses part, lines
261-263.
Results
13) Results are difficult to follow since there are no tables containing them to
present them in an organized fashion
We have added a table summarizing the results of each GzLM (table S1). The following
sentence has been added at the beginning of the results section: “The relative
mportance of each variable (rvi) is shown in Table 2. The values indicate the number of
imes a variable was present in the best models (<U+0394>AICc<4). A summary of the Gzlm with
z and p-values is presented in the Supplementary Information section (Table S1).
Lines 267-269.
Discussion
nfluences on road crossing behaviors may be a bit too far based on the study design. I
believe it would be better to stick with the difference by country and suggest that
perhaps these are a reflection of different cultures rather than a statement of fact (line
426). I think more would need to be done to measure road design differences,
dentifying measureable cultural behaviors, and getting a larger sample would be
mportant. Some qualitative work assessing perspectives on some of the behaviors
observed may be helpful as well to get some context (in a future study, of course).
We have changed these sentences and as you suggest, we have added: “The main result
of our study is the great impact of the country of residence on the road-crossing
behaviours of pedestrians. The differences between the two countries are probably a
reflection of different cultures. In order to confirm this, it would be interesting to not
only study different sites in other countries than France and Japan, but also repeat this
study at other sites in the same countries to investigate possible geographical variation
n road crossing behaviour. This will make it possible to better identify measureable
cultural behaviours to adapt road design to the populations using them.” Lines 462-468
and in the rest of the manuscript.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
find your results quite interesting, especially the fact that people in Japan and in France
behave so differently, it seems.
Thank you very much for these comments. We have tried to answer all your comments
n a positive manner, and we hope that you will find this revision satisfactory.
But, as a skeptic, I must ask, is it differences between the people of the countries or
differences in roadway and control design that differ?
The first reviewer made the same comment. We have changed some sentences in order
o be less culture oriented, and the text now reads as follows: ““The main result of our
study is the great impact of the country of residence on the road-crossing behaviours of
pedestrians. The differences between the two countries are probably a reflection of
different cultures. In order to confirm this, it would be interesting to not only study
different sites in other countries than France and Japan, but also repeat this study at
other sites in the same countries to investigate possible geographical variation in road
crossing behaviour. This will make it possible to better identify measureable cultural
behaviours to adapt road design to the populations using them.” Lines 462-468
Our decision to investigate different comparable sites in each country was an attempt to
avoid this site-dependent effect. We provide more information about the sites in the
Supplementary Information section.
As a start, you need to describe what ‘green’ pedestrian light means. Is that an exclusive
phase with no turning vehicles crossing the crosswalk? If there are turning vehicles,
red phase during times when there are no vehicles approaching. You discuss the time
rom previous vehicle passage, but I did not read about time (in seconds) until next
vehicle is arriving.
We have added the turning vehicle variable in Table 1. However, drivers in turning
vehicles know that crossing pedestrians have priority, whilst pedestrians who are
crossing at the red light may be in greater danger, as the driver of a coming vehicle may
be less careful as he/she has the right to pass. So for us the risk is much higher when
crossing at the red light. Moreover, the speed of turning vehicles is much lower than the
speed of vehicles that are going straight on. We have added these sentences in the
manuscript, lines 137-142.
As far as the time until the next vehicle arrives is concerned, this variable is not included
n this paper as it has already been analysed in a previous paper where no interaction
was seen between this variable and light color (on road crossing sites without
pedestrian lights) or collective behavior (analyses on unaccompanied pedestrians):
Sueur, C., Class, B., Hamm, C., Meyer, X. & Pelé, M. 2013 Different risk thresholds in
pedestrian road crossing behaviour: a comparison of French and Japanese approaches.
Accid. Anal. Prev. 58, 59–63. In this previous study, we evaluated individual risk, whilst in
his submitted study we focus more on collectives.
I have lived roughly half my life in Sweden and half my life in the USA. In Sweden, if
a pedestrian calls for green (push button), most signals immediately give them green,
and at most locations there are no gaps to jaywalk in until the green light (or just before
t). In the US, the situation is typically the opposite, if you push the button, you still have
o wait a minute or two even if there are no cars approaching and once you get the walk
ight there will typically be turning vehicles crossing all [4] crosswalks at an intersection
since right-turn-on-red is the norm. In the US, it is definitely safer to cross during red if
here are no cars within sight distance than wait for green and cross when there are
stopped cars around that may start up at any time. I do not know if France and Japan see
similar differences since I have never been to Japan and spent only limited time in
France. And, even in Sweden, turning cars vs green walking pedestrians are involved in
more pedestrian crashes than red-walking pedestrians are except for in Stockholm, the
biggest city in Sweden. Well, those results are old and may no longer be quite accurate.
They are from my own research as discussed in the next paragraph.
There was no button to trigger the green light at any of the sites we studied. This system
does exist in France, and pedestrians have to wait a long time after pushing the button,
but this type of pedestrian crossing is rare. It is true that they are more frequent in the
US than in France. We do not remember seeing this system in Japan (we are not
referring to our study sites, where we are sure that no such buttons existed, but about
any site anywhere else in Japan). We have added this detail to our manuscript. We were
not under the impression that turning vehicles were more dangerous than vehicles
going straight on, but more that the drivers of the latter (going straight on) tried to pass
at the orange light by accelerating, making the situations very risky. This is the reason
we studied the last car, i.e. to show that pedestrians wait for this last car to pass even if
he pedestrian light is green.
Since this journal recommends non-blind reviews, I will go into my own research.
Happy to see it. Thanks.
Back in 1989, I published a paper in Accident Analysis and Prevention called Pedestrian
safety at Traffic Signals: A study Carried out with the Help of a Traffic Conflict Technique
(by Per Gårder). One part of that paper (Section 7. The Influence of Various Factors on
he Percentage of Pedestrians Crossing on Red) discusses red-light walking. In that
study, I found that people in bigger cities jaywalk (walk against red) much more than in
smaller towns. And, like you, I found that refuge islands increase the rate by 5.4
percentage points. But unlike you, I still concluded that refuge islands make it
significantly safer for pedestrians to cross streets.
We have cited your study and added a sentence about this result, lines 387-389.
We have also removed the last sentence about the compromise.
also found that bad weather increases jaywalking and, like you, that long wait times
ncrease jaywalking, at least some. For every second longer red time, jaywalking
ncreased by 0.017%.
We have added a sentence about this result, lines 395-396.
also found that men walk against red about 40% more than women and that young
men do it three times more than the average pedestrian, so many of your results are
supported by my studies. And I reference studies that the risk may be 20 times greater
or red walkers than green walkers. (Cameron, Stanton and Milne 1976).
We have added this reference to the introduction, line 52.
However, I am also aware of the fact that a pedestrian may be at higher risk if walking
with the light both in the beginning of a walk phase and throughout the phase when
urning cars have high speeds than if they walk against the red light at times when there
are no cars around.
Please read our previous reply concerning these turning vehicles.
You write that French pedestrians cross against the lights much more often (41.9%)
han Japanese (2.1%). It would be interesting to know what percentage walk against red
of those arriving during red (the don’t walk phase) (rather than of all pedestrians). This
number may in France be as high as 99% of those arriving when there is a red light. Can
you give that number.
We agree; this is a good idea. We have added the sentence: “). It increases to 76.3% in
France but only 5.7% in Japan when only pedestrians arriving at the kerb at the red light
are considered (we removed data for pedestrians arriving when the light was green, as
hey could not cross against the light).” Lines 274-276
You write, “Twice as many pedestrians followed another crossing against the red light in
France as in Japan” This surprises me. If only 2.1% cross on red and we assume that it is
red half the time, than 4 out of 100 coming to red cross on red in Japan. And fewer than
half is following someone, so fewer than 2 in 100 follow someone. If that number is
double in France, fewer than 4 out of a hundred would follow someone. That seems
mpossible if we have roughly 80% going against red and 20% waiting for green (again,
f it is green half the time). Please explain.
This rate was calculated by taking into account the criterion of what we considered as a
collective crossing and separating two collective crossings. During these collective
crossings at the red light, a pedestrian starting to cross at the red light was followed on
average by one or two persons in Japan but about four persons in France. Then, after a
delay based on the time needed to cross the road on each site, another collective
crossing could begin (or not). We do not have only one collective crossing at each phase
(red or green) but we may have several collective crossings, or individual crossings,
according to the criterion we used. This was maybe a misunderstanding leading to your
remark. We hope that we have answered it clearly.
You write in the abstract, “However, Japanese pedestrians are less influenced by social
nformation, as fewer of them followed others crossing at the red light and those who
did so crossed faster, indicating their risk awareness.” Why is that ‘less’ influenced? It
seems like only about half of French pedestrians followed the others’ lead [or much
ewer according to my discussion in the paragraph above] whereas a vast majority of
apanese pedestrians did what their fellow citizens did, that is if someone else was
waiting, they also decided to wait, since 97.9% did not cross on red. To make your point,
you will need to show separate numbers for French and Japanese pedestrian behavior of
what happens when one person jaywalks versus when all previously arrived
pedestrians are waiting. And, then you need to control that for the influence of traffic
volume (gaps) and possibly speed, etc. And, you do some of that in the main text.
We understand your point. The thing is that Japanese citizens were more influenced by
other pedestrians (their presence and behaviours), except when other pedestrians
crossed at the red light. In this condition, half as many Japanese pedestrians followed as
heir French counterparts, as they respect the rules more. We have changed the
sentences in the abstract, which now reads as follows: “Individuals deciding to cross the
road were strongly influenced by the behaviour and the presence of other pedestrians,
especially in Japan, where a stronger conformism was noted. However, Japanese
pedestrians were half as likely to be influenced by social information as their French
counterparts when crossing at the red light, as they were more respectful of rules.” Lines
20-24
The number of lanes increased the acceptable distance of the next car for pedestrians,
but they considered the safe distance to be shorter when in the presence of pedestrian
refuge island [28,30]. This kind of infrastructure may therefore be advantageous in so
ar that it prevents accidents but could also encourage pedestrians to cross against the
ight and increase this behaviour. A compromise needs to be found in order to know
n a great hurry are the most likely to cross during the red phase, and are also the most
ikely to be hit (exempting intoxicated people who are at even greater risk). These
people in a hurry benefit from refuge islands more than other people lose from them in
safety. This is speculation by me, but I urge you to not recommend cities to stop building
refuge islands. Many evaluations show that the actual number of pedestrian crashes are
cut in half or more by their existence.
We have changed this paragraph to give a more positive view of refuge islands and have
removed the last sentence about the compromise.
This means that the number of pedestrians crossing against the red light is much lower
when other pedestrians are present … indicating a strong social influence” Yes, probably
hat people do not want to be bad role models, especially in front of children. Also, if
aywalking is illegal and enforced, people will think there is a higher risk of being fined if
here are other humans around.
Yes, you are right. We already mention this assumption in the manuscript: “Indeed,
results show a greater decrease in the rate of rule-breaking when other people are
present in Japan compared to France. People who would cross against the red light
when alone do not cross when other pedestrians are present and waiting because they
are more afraid of being criticised than they are of being fined.” Lines 458-461. hope this
will suffice; please tell us if you wish to discuss this point further.
The English is very good, but a few sentences need to be fixed, such as “Men were also
started crossing sooner than women…” and “a decrease in the number of accidents could
be attained through a better understanding how human beings behave…” changed to
Men also started crossing sooner than women…” and “a decrease in the number of
accidents could be attained through a better understanding of how human beings
behave…”
We have corrected these sentences. Thank you very much.
Finally, you discuss the animal ‘humans’ and primates. You could also discuss Raccoons
iving in big North American cities. I read in (I think) the National Geographic magazine
many years ago that mothers teach their children (offspring) to wait until there are no
vehicles close by, and then when she crosses, the children follow just behind, something
she learned from her mother. Then they run across as fast as possible to avoid getting
hit in the ‘last’ lane. Also, their territories are usually delineated by arterials, so they
never cross the big streets.
We could not find the reference you talked about but we found other references about
other animal species . We have added the following paragraph: “It is interesting to note
hat in other animal species, individuals of different age, social status or gender also
cross the road in different ways [42–45]. In meerkats (Suricata suricatta), the dominant
emale is the last one to cross the road and crossing at the last position is the less risky
behaviour [44]. In chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), dominant individuals act
ndividuals paying attention to group members by checking on them or waiting for them
while crossing. Ninety percent of the studied chimpanzees looked right and left before
crossing [42,43]. More detailed studies of the origins of road crossing behaviours in
animals could widen our understanding of behavioural differences between human
beings.” Lines 421-429

Comments to the Author(s)
Dear Authors:
Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript again. I believe
you have responded to my critiques from the first review quite thoroughly.
My only remaining comment is regarding my previous critique #12 about the
need for clustering. By clustering I was referring to clustering and
correlated data I was referring to individual observations being related to
one another within a location and a country rather than collinearity
between variables. This type of correlation needs to be accounted for by
clustering in the estimates of the standard error or in
multilevel/hierarchical models (e.g., generalized estimating equations or
generalized linear mixed models).
Thank you very much for you work and your nice comments. Ok, so now we
understood what you wanted us to add. Sorry, we are not used to this
analysis. We made a hierarchical cluster analysis following a principal
component analysis. This is indicated now in the methods section and tables
and figures are shown in the supplementary information file.
“Hierarchical cluster analysis
We performed a hierarchical cluster analysis following a principal
component analysis in order to explore the distribution of variables and
data. The hierarchical cluster analysis (automatic selection) showed that
the data are clustered in five clusters and this distribution mainly
depends on the arrival order, the waiting time, the closeness to the kerb
and the total number of pedestrians. Figures and Tables about contributions
of each variable as well as statistical values are given in the
supplementary information file(figure S8 and tables S2-S5).” Lines 239-245.
