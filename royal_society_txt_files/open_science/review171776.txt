This manuscript described the Cr(VI) removal capacity by Fe3O4 nanoparticle coated mushroom
source biomaterial. The results may provide some useful informatin for treatment of Cr(VI)
pollution. However, major revisions are required for the improvement of this manuscript. The
comments are as follows:
1. Did the author research the capacity of ACS and Fe3O4 for Cr(VI) removal? Both of them have
lower Cr(VI) removal capacity than ACS-Fe3O4? But there are no experimental data showed that.
2. In figures, remvoal rate is not quite appropriate. Removal rate usually means the change in a
unit time, such as per min, hour.
3. In fig.2A, (a) and (b) were not marked in SEM picture.
4. Duplicate or triplicate were conducted? The relative deviation of parallel samples should be
shown in figures.
5. Revisions are needed in many places for improvement of English level. The following are some
expamples. Please check the whole manuscript carefully and make revisions.

Dear Dr Smith
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our manuscript entitled
“Fe3O4 nanoparticle coated mushroom source biomaterial for Cr(VI) polluted liquid treatment and
mechanism research” (Manuscript ID: RSOS-171776). Those comments are valuable and helpful
for improving our paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our study. We have studied
these comments carefully and have made some corrections which we hope meet with approval. The
revised part has been marked in red in the revised manuscript.
The main corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s comments are as follows.
Responds to Reviewers' Comments
Reviewer: 1
This manuscript described the Cr(VI) removal capacity by Fe3O4 nanoparticle coated mushroom
source biomaterial. The results may provide some useful information for treatment of Cr(VI)
pollution. However, major revisions are required for the improvement of this manuscript. The
comments are as follows:
1. Did the author research the capacity of ACS and Fe3O4 for Cr(VI) removal? Both of them have
lower Cr(VI) removal capacity than ACS- Fe3O4? But there are no experimental data showed that.
Answer: Thank you for your careful work. We have investigated the capacity of ACS and pure
Fe3O4 on Cr(VI) removal, but because of our negligence we did not include all of the data in the
manuscript except the capacity of ACS as shown in Fig. 1. The Cr(VI) removal capacity of ACS-
Fe3O4 was much higher than ACS but slightly lower than pure Fe3O4. With 0.2g of adsorbent
suspended in 50ml of 200mg L-1 Cr(VI) solution (pH 7) in 100ml conical flask at 25°C, 180rpm for
24h, the removal percentage of Cr(VI) by ACS, Fe3O4 and ACS-Fe3O4 was 22.62±0.69%,
43.84±1.64% and 42.06±1.13%, individually. The modification of Fe3O4 dramatically enhanced
Cr(VI) removal capacity of ACS and ACS-Fe3O4 showed limited decrease of Cr(VI) removal
capacity but a lot higher valid time than Fe3O4 as presented in Fig. 5.
The result was shown in Fig. 1 of the revised manuscript. In the revised manuscript, two new
paragraphs were added in Section 2.2 and 3.1:
Section 2.2: “Pure Fe3O4 was also prepared with the same method without ACS. The ability of pure
Fe3O4 and ACS-Fe3O4 for Cr(VI) removal was also tested with the same condition mentioned in
section 2.1.”
Section 3.1: “As shown in Fig. 1, the ability of pure Fe3O4 and ACS-Fe3O4 for Cr(VI) removal was
much better than unmodified materials, and pure Fe3O4 presented a higher but not significant
(P<0.05) removal capacity than ACS-Fe3O4, indicating ACS-Fe3O4 had similar adsorption capacity
with pure Fe3O4 at current experiment condition, but better stability as proved later in the paper.”
2. In figures, removal rate is not quite appropriate. Removal rate usually means the change in a unit
time, such as per min, hour.
Answer: Thank you for your advice. Indeed, “removal rate” usually means the change in a unit time,
and it is not appropriate in this paper. In the revised manuscript, the presentation of “removal rate”
was changed to “removal percentage” in both texts and figures.
3. In fig.2A, (a) and (b) were not marked in SEM picture.
Answer: We are very sorry for our negligence, we have corrected the mistake. In the revised
manuscript, a, b, c were marked in the SEM pictures of Fig. 2A.
4. Duplicate or triplicate were conducted? The relative deviation of parallel samples should be
shown in figures.
Answer: Triplicate parallel tests were conducted in this study. According to the reviewer’s advice,
we repainted the figures. In the revised version of the paper, the relative deviation of parallel samples
was shown in figures. It was noteworthy that no relative deviation was available in “Fig. 4 The
effects of all controllable factors on S/N ratio” as S/N ratio was calculated by JMP 10 (SAS, USA).
5. Revisions are needed in many places for improvement of English level. The following are some
examples. Please check the whole manuscript carefully and make revisions.
Page 2, line 30, Abstract: “heavy metal remove” should be revised as “heavy metal removal” .
Page 11, line 203, “Cr(VI) remove capacity” should be revised as “Cr(VI) removal capacity”.
Page 11, line 215, Cr6+ + Fe2+ Cr6+ + Fe3+ ?
Page 12,line 225, “turn points”?(turning points?)
Page 12, line 226, “were chose” should be correcred as “were chosen”?
Answer: The authors re-checked the manuscript carefully and made some revisions to improve the
grammar. The manuscript was also polished by a professional for the better understanding of the
readers. Parts of the revisions were listed as follows:
Page 2, line 30, “heavy metal remove” was revised as “heavy metal removal”;
Page 7, line 137, “therefor” was changed to “therefore”;
Page 11, line 203, “remove capacity” was revised as “removal capacity”;
Page 11, line 215, “ Cr 6+ + 3Fe2+ <U+2192> Cr 3+ + 3Fe3+ ” was changed to “ Cr 6+ + 3Fe2+ <U+2192> Cr 3+ +
3Fe3+ ”.
Page 12, line 225-226, “The turn points 200, 400, 600mg L-1 were chose as factor levels in optimal
experiment.” was revised as “The turning points 200, 400, 600mg L-1 were chosen as factor levels
in optimal experiment.”;
Page 12, line 225-226, “The effect of pH on was shown in Fig. 3d” was changed to “The effects of
pH were shown in Fig. 3d with 0.2g ACS-Fe3O4 suspended in 50mL Cr(VI) solution (200mg L-1)
for 24h at 180rpm, 25°C”;
Page 12, line 239, “CrO42-+H+<U+2192>Cr6++H2O” was revised as “CrO42-+8H+<U+2192>Cr6++4H2O”;
Special thanks to you for your good comments.

The article describes the use of mushroom to remove the hexavalent chromium ions (Cr(VI)) from
aqueous solution, it is an interesting alternative method. However, the manuscript needs to be
improved.
Some specific comments and recommendations are listed below:
1. The manuscript need to include some real samples
Answer: Thank you for your comments. In my opinion, you might think the adsorbent developed in
this study should be tested using real industrial wastewater instead of simulated wastewater alone.
We agree with your opinion and we have done some additional experiments to enrich the content of
the research using industrial wastewater.
The additional experiments had been added in supplementary material as follows:
Details for verification test
The tannery wastewater was obtained from a tannery from Zhengxing, Tianfu New Area, Chengdu,
Sichuan, China (30°25'28<U+2033> N, 104°0'47<U+2033> E). Before experiment, the wastewater was filtrated to
remove suspended solids. And parameters of the wastewater including CODCr, NH4-N, Cl and Cr(VI)
were determined according to Chinese National Standard GB/T 11914, HJ/T 195, HJ/T 84, GB/T
7467, separately. Crtotal was determined by FAAS.
The test was conducted at optimal treatment condition derived from Taguchi methods except for
initial Cr(VI) concentration (240min, 40°C, pH 3, dosage at 12 g L-1, rpm at 200) with 50mL
wastewater in a 100ml conical flask. The pH was adjusted to 3 with 0.5mol L-1 H2SO4. The
parameters of wastewater were shown in STable 4. According to Chinese National Standard GB
30486-2013 Discharge standard of water pollutants for leather and fur making industry, after
treatment by ACS-Fe3O4, all the parameters were below the standard values except CODCr,
indicating ACS-Fe3O4 was efficient for the practical treatment of tannery wastewater.
Stable 4 Parameters of tannery wastewater before and after treatment
(Units: mg L-1 except pH)
Parameters Limit value Before After Removal percentage
CODCr 300 1200.73 435.24 63.75%
NH4-N 70 124.15 59.67 51.94%
Cl 4000 5157.34 3096.20 39.97%
Cr(VI) 0.20 5.46 0.09 98.35%
Crtotal 1.50 19.78 0.87 95.60%
pH 6-9 7.03 4.36
A new paragraph was added in Section 3.4 to present the supplementary experiment:
Verification test
In real industry process, the parameters of the polluted liquid could be complex, and the
concentration of Cr in wastewater could be different39. To verify the availability of optimal
conditions and feasibility of ACS-Fe3O4 in practice, a verification test was conducted using tannery
wastewater. The detailed experiment process was presented in supplementary material and the result
was shown in STable 4. After treatment, 98.35% of Cr(VI) and 95.60% of total Cr was removed.
The treatment also contributed to the decrease of COD, NH4-N and Cl, verifying the feasibility of
the adsorbent and optimized adsorption conditions from this study in practical use.

using electrocoagulation: Influence of the quality of aluminium used for the electrode.[J]. Journal
of Hazardous Materials, 2016, 319:69-77.
2. In the title replace “biomaterail”
Answer: Sorry for the negligence, in the revised manuscript, “biomaterail” was changed to
“biomaterial”.
3. In page 3, line 16 the superscript is incorrect
Answer: According to the reviewer’s opinion, the superscript in page 3, line 16 was corrected and
the sentence was revised as:
The United States Environmental Protection Agency set the maximum contaminant limits as 100
µg L-1 for total chromium in drinking water3.
4. In the page 6, line 6 explain the aged process
Answer: In the field of material, the aged process usually referred to the stabilization or crystal
formation process during material preparation. The Fe3O4 in this paper was prepared according to
Jiang et al.[1]. In this research, during ACS-Fe3O4 production, the reaction of FeCl2·4H2O,
FeCl3·6H2O and ammonium hydroxide as well as the stabilization of Fe3O4 may not finish
immediately, the mixture was aged at 90±5°C for an additional 30min to make sure the efficient
reaction of the substrate in the system and the stabilization of product.

magnetite.[J]. Environmental Science & Technology, 2014, 48(14):8078.
5. In the page 6, line 57 do not explain the meaning of LES
In the page 7, line 9 do not explain the meaning of LES
In the page 7, line 19 do not explain the meaning of LES
Answer: Thank you for your careful work. The “LES” was a writing error and it should be written
as “ACS”. In the revised manuscript, the mistake was corrected.
6. In the page 7, line 48 replace “therefor”
Answer: Thank you for your careful work. The “therefor” was a writing error and it should be
written as “therefore”. In the revised manuscript, the mistake was corrected.
7. In the page 9 line 15 include space “63days”
In the page 9 line 18 include space “7days”
Answer: According to the reviewer’s advice, corresponding changes had been made in the revised
manuscript.
8. In the page 11 line 21 need to include the experimental conditions of other factors
In the page 11 line 51 need to include the experimental conditions of other factors
Answer: Thank you for your advice, the experimental conditions of other factors had been included
in the revised manuscript.
After revision, the sentence in page 11 line 21 was changed to “Fig. 3a showed that when 0.2g ACS-
Fe3O4 was suspended in 50mL Cr(VI) solution (200mg L-1, pH 7) at 180rpm, 25°C, the adsorption
capacity of ACS-Fe3O4 at different initial concentrations increased fast at the beginning, then
slowed down until reaching equilibrium.”
The sentence in page 11 line 51 was changed to “Profiles for Cr(VI) removal when 0.2g ACS-Fe3O4
was suspended in a series of 50mL Cr(VI) solution (pH 7) at 25°C, 180rpm for 24h was shown in
Fig. 3b.”
9. In the page 12 line 31 use the complex diagram for the explained the pH effect
Answer: Sorry for our negligence. According to the reviewer’s advice, the complex diagram was
used in the revised version of the manuscript.
The sentence was changed to “The effects of pH were shown in Fig. 3d with 0.2g ACS-Fe3O4
suspended in 50mL Cr(VI) solution (200mg L-1) for 24h at 180rpm, 25°C.”
10. In the page 12 line 56 why the percentage decreases?
Answer: Thank you for your comment.
The single factor experiment of Rpm was conducted at 0, 100 and 200rpm, 25°C with 50 ml Cr(VI)
(200 mg L-1, pH 7) and 0.2g ACS-Fe3O4 for 24h, which was much different from the optimal
condition (240min, 40°C, pH 3, Cr(VI) at 200 mg L-1, dosage at 12 g L-1, rpm at 200), that’s why
the removal percentage was relatively low.
In this research, the removal percentage of Cr(VI) was influenced by environmental conditions
including initial concentration, pH, rpm, adsorbent dose, treatment time, temperature (influence
from big to small). The specific environmental conditions conducted in the single factor experiment
of Rpm caused the decreased removal percentage compared with others.
11. In the page 14 line 39 replace 3A by 3a
Answer: We agree to the reviewer’s opinion. According to the reviewer’s advice, “3A” was replaced
by “3a” after revision.
12. In the page 15 line 7 the Stable 4 do not exist
Answer: Sorry for the negligence. The “Stable 4” in the page 15 line 7 was an error and the mistake
was corrected after revision.
<U+0001D439>
In the revised manuscript, page 15 line 7 was changed to “The results of SSF and <U+0001D445><U+0001D458> were shown
in Table 3 and STable 5, respectively.”
13. In the page 15 line 52 the regression coefficient “R2” in the Table 4A are in minuscule
Answer: Sorry for our negligence, after revision, the mistake was corrected and “R2” was changed
to “r2”.
14. In the page 17 line 32 the removal rate is high
Answer: Thank you for your work.
The sentence in page 17 line 32 introduced the maximum removal percentage of Cr(VI) under
optimal environmental conditions (240min, 40°C, pH 3, Cr(VI) at 200 mg L-1, dosage at 12 g L-1,
rpm at 200) derived from Taguchi methods, which was much higher than tests conducted at other
conditions such as the condition in page 12 line 56. In page 12 line 56, the removal percentages
from 36.22-40.59% were obtained from single factor experiment of Rpm, which was conducted at
0, 100 and 200rpm, 25°C with 50 ml Cr(VI) (200 mg L-1, pH 7) and 0.2g ACS-Fe3O4 for 24h, far
from the optimal conditions. That’s why the removal percentage was relative high.
15. In the page 21 line 31 do not exist correct description
Answer: Thank you for your scrupulous work. After revision, the mistake was corrected.
Sentence in the page 21 line 31 was changed to “Fig. 4 The effects of all controllable factors on S/N
ratio.”
Special thanks to you for your good comments.
We tried our best to improve the manuscript and made some changes in the manuscript. These
changes will not influence the content and framework of the paper. And here we did not list the
changes but marked in red in revised paper.
We appreciate for Editors/Reviewers’ warm work earnestly, and hope that the correction will meet
with approval.
