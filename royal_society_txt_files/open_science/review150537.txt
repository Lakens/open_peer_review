Review
Predator olfactory cues generate a foraging-predation tradeoff through distraction
Spiepielski, A., Fallon, E., Boersma, K.
The authors conducted a simple, elegant study to demonstrate that damselfly larvae
show similar antipredator responses to both direct cues from the predator and indirect cues
released by conspecifics in response to a predator. I do not have any major criticisms of the
manuscript and detail only minor comments below.
Line 69: Is this statement meant to be specifically for olfactory/chemical cues or about cue
modalities more general (e.g. visual versus olfactory). Please clarify.
Line 73: I find the use of direct/indirect somewhat confusing in the paragraph because it is
applied to both direct costs (i.e. reduced movement) and direct cues (i.e. from the predator).
Line 90: The phrase ‘identical conditions’ seems inaccurate, as I assume the fish were not kept in
scintillation vials and did not have a perch?
Line 120: Why the change in water temperature?
Line 139 – 141: Seems more appropriate to say that damselflies respond by altering behavior
rather than saying the behaviors respond.
Line 152: Is the “trend towards a reduction” a qualitative or quantitative assessment? If it is
quantitative it would be helpful to include the results of posthoc statistical tests following this
sentence.
Line 161: Could strike number also simply decrease as a function of time (i.e. the damselflies are
less motivated to eat overtime as they get full?).
Line 203: I agree with this argument, although I do not see how it could apply to aggressive
behaviors in this study as damselflies were alone during trails.
Line 212-214: This hypothesis could be quite easily tested using a similar design and adding a
group with combined cues.

This manuscript reports on an experiment in which damselfly larvae are exposed to various
olfactory cues, some of which should indicate increased risk of predation. The results show that
in response to two different types of cues, damselflies reduce activity, capture less prey, and miss
more often when attacking prey, i.e., they become less lethal. The last result is particularly novel
and valuable. I am very enthusiastic about this little study up to this point. But unfortunately,
the conceptual framework is in need of extensive revision, in my opinion. Or at least the
vocabulary that the authors choose to use needs to be changed. The problem is in the choice of
‘distraction’. The idea is that damselflies are poorer predators because they are distracted by
their own predators, as if this response is not adaptive and is something that cannot be helped.
Fortunately the appropriate framework and vocabulary for thinking about this issue already
exists. It is the idea of vigilance and apprehension (Brown et al 1999, J. Mammal; Dall et al 2001
Ann. Zool. Fennici; Kotler et al. 2010 RSPB, Berger-Tal et al 2010 Ecology, Berger-Tal et al. 2010
Ecology Letters, Embar et al. 2011 Oikos, and others). Apprehension is when a forager redirects
attention from foraging tasks to predator detection and gives risk to a penalty of multi-tasking
because the forager ends up making more mistakes in its foraging tasks as a result. It is an
adaptive response and is part of risk management, where the two primary tools of risk
management are time allocation and apprehension/vigilance. What is happening with the
damselflies is risk management in which both time allocation to foraging is reduced and
apprehension is increased. But distraction is not involved. Distraction is when something occurs
to reduce the total amount of attention available to allocation to foraging tasks and predator
detection tasks. See Raveh et al 2011 Ecol Letters for an example where ectoparasites distract
gerbils under risk of predation from foxes, thus reducing the attention they have available, and
making them poorer at both foraging tasks and predator detection and making them manage risk
solely through time allocation. This problem can easily be remedied by appropriately revising
the Introduction and the Discussion.
The second thing I wish to discuss reflects the authors’ possible future work with this system. It
does not reflect on the quality and value of the current work. I noticed that harvest rates always
dropped between the pre-treatment measurement and the treatment measurement, even in the
control treatment. Is this because of prey depletion? If so, you have a powerful approach
available to you for deconstructing risk management into time allocation and
vigilance/apprehension. This is done by constructing harvest rate curves in which harvest rates
are plotted against prey density. The technique is based on Joel Brown’s 1999 Optimal vigilance
theory that appears in Evol. Ecol. Res. It is applied in the papers cited above, starting with Kotler
et al. 2010. Have a look. I think you will find it valuable.

Specific comments:
1. Lines 60-61. Maybe. But not at all necessary. Just limited attention that has to be split
between foraging tasks and predator detection tasks (or detection of any agent that can cause
injury, such as an aggressive interferer) is sufficient.
2. Line 147. If much depletion occurs during the trials, there could have been sufficient
depletion from the first observation period to the second to cause differences that are unrelated to
treatment.
3. Line 169. You have nice support of predation risk doing something to attention that
results in more foraging mistakes, i.e., misses. I would say that it most likely has to do with
greater apprehension or vigilance. You have no support that it has anything to do with number
of cues. And I don't think you have any real evidence that it has anything to do with distraction,
either. These are nice results, but you really need new vocabulary to discuss this.

Keywords: predator, prey cues, predation risk, foraging-predation tradeoff
Abstract: Most animals are faced with the challenge of securing food under the risk of predation.
This frequently generates a tradeoff whereby animals respond to predator cues with reduced
movement to avoid predation at the direct cost of reduced foraging success. However, predators
may also cause prey to be distracted in their foraging activities, which would generate an indirect
“distraction cost”. Here we test this distraction cost hypothesis and show that damselflies miss a
greater proportion of their prey during foraging bouts in response to both olfactory cues
produced by conspecifics that have only viewed a fish predator and olfactory cues produced
directly by fish. This reduced feeding efficiency is in addition to the stereotypical anti-predator
response of reduced activity, which we also observed. These results suggest that costs associated
with anti-predator responses not only arise through behavioral alterations that reduce the risk of
predation, but also from the indirect distraction costs of reduced feeding efficiency under the
threat of predation.

Abstract: Most animals are faced with the challenge of securing food under the risk of predation.
This frequently generates a tradeoff whereby animals respond to predator cues with reduced

may also cause prey to be apprehensive in their foraging activities, which would generate an
indirect “apprehension cost.” Apprehension arises when a forager redirects attention from
foraging tasks to predator detection and incurs a cost from such multi-tasking because the forager
ends up making more mistakes in its foraging tasks as a result. Here we test this apprehension
cost hypothesis and show that damselflies miss a greater proportion of their prey during foraging

These results show that costs associated with anti-predator responses not only arise through

apprehension and multitasking that can reduce feeding efficiency under the threat of predation.

ntion they have available, and making them poorer at both foraging tasks and predator detection and
ing them manage risk solely through time allocation. This problem can easily be remedied by
ropriately revising the Introduction and the Discussion.
thank the reviewer for providing this straightforward explanation of the distinction between
raction and apprehension. During our initial literature review, we did not come across these
ers and were unaware of the existing framework established by the set of papers the reviewer
vided. We agree that our study fits in with this general framework and have revised the ms
ordingly. Namely, we now use the term “apprehension” instead of distraction. We hope it is ok,
we use some of the reviewers own wording here to describe apprehension, as it very succinctly
cribes the phenomenon (Lines 25-27 and 53-55). We now also include several references
gested by the reviewer on this topic.
second thing I wish to discuss reflects the authors’ possible future work with this system. It does not
ect on the quality and value of the current work. I noticed that harvest rates always dropped between
pre-treatment measurement and the treatment measurement, even in the control treatment. Is this
ause of prey depletion? If so, you have a powerful approach available to you for deconstructing risk
agement into time allocation and vigilance/apprehension. This is done by constructing harvest rate
ves in which harvest rates are plotted against prey density. The technique is based on Joel Brown’s
9 Optimal vigilance theory that appears in Evol. Ecol. Res. It is applied in the papers cited above,
ting with Kotler et al. 2010. Have a look. I think you will find it valuable.
thank the reviewer for this suggestion and will adopt this approach in future studies.
cific comments:
Lines 60-61. Maybe. But not at all necessary. Just limited attention that has to be split between
ging tasks and predator detection tasks (or detection of any agent that can cause injury, such as an
ressive interferer) is sufficient.
changed this to “Important.” Line 61.
Line 147. If much depletion occurs during the trials, there could have been sufficient depletion
m the first observation period to the second to cause differences that are unrelated to treatment.
s is a possibility. However, given the experimental design there should be no consistent
erences in depletion among treatments prior to the application of the predator cue treatments.
us, any effect of depletion would be present in all treatments and any differences observed in the
ponse variables would be due to the predator cue treatments, not any depletion. We did add a
tence noting depletion as an explanation for the reduction in the number of strikes we observed
r treatments were applied. Lines 164 - 165.
Line 169. You have nice support of predation risk doing something to attention that results in
e foraging mistakes, i.e., misses. I would say that it most likely has to do with greater apprehension or
lance. You have no support that it has anything to do with number of cues. And I don't think you
e any real evidence that it has anything to do with distraction, either. These are nice results, but you
ly need new vocabulary to discuss this.

dator olfactory cues generate a foraging-predation tradeoff through distraction
epielski, A., Fallon, E., Boersma, K.
authors conducted a simple, elegant study to demonstrate that damselfly larvae
w similar antipredator responses to both direct cues from the predator and indirect cues
ased by conspecifics in response to a predator. I do not have any major criticisms of the
uscript and detail only minor comments below.
e 69: Is this statement meant to be specifically for olfactory/chemical cues or about cue
dalities more general (e.g. visual versus olfactory). Please clarify.
now specified this as a more general statement. Lines 70-71.
e 73: I find the use of direct/indirect somewhat confusing in the paragraph because it is
lied to both direct costs (i.e. reduced movement) and direct cues (i.e. from the predator).
s is why we specified the statement with parenthetical statements specifying the direct or
irect nature. We made no changes.
e 90: The phrase ‘identical conditions’ seems inaccurate, as I assume the fish were not kept
cintillation vials and did not have a perch?
now specify that the identical conditions referred to the temperature and light conditions. Line
e 120: Why the change in water temperature?
s is simply the temperature of the room where the assays were conducted; we now clarify this.
es 121-124.
e 139 – 141: Seems more appropriate to say that damselflies respond by altering behavior
er than saying the behaviors respond.
eed. We revised this sentence accordingly. Lines 143-145.
e 152: Is the “trend towards a reduction” a qualitative or quantitative assessment? If it is
ntitative it would be helpful to include the results of posthoc statistical tests following this
ence.
removed this sentence. It was simply a qualitative statement on the basis of the change shown in
figure.
e 161: Could strike number also simply decrease as a function of time (i.e. the damselflies
less motivated to eat overtime as they get full?).
iewer 1 raised this possibility in a different light by asking about prey depletion in their second
ment. Please see above for our general response, where we now note this possible satiation
ct in lines 164-165 as an explanation for the reduction in the number of strikes.
e 203: I agree with this argument, although I do not see how it could apply to aggressive
aviors in this study as damselflies were alone during trails.
eed, we changed this to simply say reduced foraging success, as that is indeed what we observed.
e 206-207.
e 212-214: This hypothesis could be quite easily tested using a similar design and adding a
up with combined cues.
s is a great suggestion that would make for a good follow-up study.

m pleased with the revision. It is excellent, and the results of reduced predator lethality is very
ortant. You should be proud. Just one minor comment: Lines 163-166. I think simply that
y depletion would lead to lower prey densities and therefore lower encounter rates and
mber of prey attacked and captured prior to the application of the treatments.
addressed this remaining comment by adding a brief clause (Lines 165-166).
