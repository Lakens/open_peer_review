The manuscript described the preparation of a DABCO based di-cationic ionic liquid and the
application of this ionic liquid in a one-pot pseudo-five-component Knoevenagel condensation
reaction. This work is an extension of studies previously published by the authors and appears to
be carefully carried out. This work is publishable.

The results reported are incremental, not proving any significant novelty. Basic iònic líquids are
known and their application for Knoevenagel reaction is well stablished. Indeed, the reaction is
catalysed by commune ILs even in absence of basic sites. The authors failed to demonstrate in
what way is the catalyst (3) better than other IL’s reported by other groups for the Knoevenagel
condensation (i.e. ACS Sustainable Chem. Eng., 2018, 6 (11), pp 13676–13680, Synthetic
Communications 2018 48(9), pp. 1060-1067, ChemistrySelect, 2018, 3(17), pp. 4745-4749, Applied
Catalysis B: Environmental Vol. 223, 2018, Pages 228-233, New J. Chem., 2015, 39, 9132-9142
without being exhaustive). Other ILs may have not been used for the specific reaction in the
paper, but the authros should compare with well stabilised benchmark reaction to stablish the
real potential of the system reported.
Regarding the green metric, are the solvents used for the recovery of the ILs taking into the
account. The calculations should be provided not only the formulas to check the validity of the
numbers.
The recycling of the ILs require the separation of the product, remove the water (energy) washing
with ether and then reuse. This is far to be a green process both water and organic solvent waste
are generated.
There are in the literature simpler and greener methods for the Knoevenagel reactions even under
continuous flow conditions (RSC Adv., 2013,3, 23075-23079, 2018, Asian Journal of Organic
Chemistry 7(10), pp. 2061-2064)

REVIEWER(S) REPORTS:
Associate Editor Comments to Author ():
RSC Associate Editor:
Comments to the Author:
The reported work appears to have been carried out in a careful manner, but the reviewers have
some significant concerns regarding significance and novelty of the work as a whole, and the true
"greenness" of the procedure. I am not quite so critical of the significance/novelty as the
nucleophiles used in these Knoevenagel reactions are rather "non-standard" compared to other
ionic liquid-promoted Knoevenagel reactions.
I suggest the authors modify their manuscript in the following ways:
(1) The authors have compared their new ionic liquid to nanoparticle catalysts, but there does not
appear to be any direct comparison with other, more established, ionic liquids. This must be
done.
(2) They should reconsider the green chemistry message in the manuscript and modify as
appropriate, keeping the reviewers' comments in mind.
5
(3) Clearly state the significance and novelty of the work with respect the the current state-of-the-
art in the area.
I addition to the comments provided by the reviewers, I have a few suggested modifications of
my own:
(1) To clarify Reviewer 1's comments about Scheme 2, the authors should define R1 and R2 for
compounds 7a-d.
(2) Page 11, procedure titled "Synthesis of derivatives 7a–j": The authors state "The catalyst was
recovered from the aqueous layer under vacuum, washed with diethyl ether and reused for the
next reactions." I assume the "catalyst" here is the ionic liquid. While the ionic liquid may very
well play an intimate role in the reaction, I have a hard time considering something that is used in
2-3.5 times excess a "catalyst". It woudl be better to just refer to this as "ionic liquid" in all
procedures.
(3) Edit the entire manuscript for grammar and word usage.

Comments to the Author:
Both the Editor and one of the reviewers asked the authors to provide a comparison between the
new ionic liquids discussed here and existing ionic liquids. The authors did not provide this
comparison. Instead, they have said that because these are new transformations, existing
comparisons in the literature are not present. This may be true, but does not address the concerns
raised. At least one reaction should be attempted using several existing (commercially available)
ionic liquids for comparison.

Comments to the Author:
The authors have included comparison experiments using several, more standard, ionic liquids.
The designer ionic liquids reported in this manuscript appear to offer some modest advantage
with respect to yield and reaction time. Nevertheless, other researchers may find these ionic
liquids useful for other applications. Now that these results are included, I can recommend
publication.
