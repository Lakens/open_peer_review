The manuscript by Charpentier & Cohen describes the effect of acidification and a GABA
antagonist on behavior of a larval crab. The authors convincingly show a mechanism that runs
counter to the prevailing view in the literature, and therefore the results would be useful and of
interest to the ocean acidification and larval behavior communities. Overall, the manuscript is
scientifically sound (see specific comments below) and the authors do not over-interpret their
results. The manuscript is generally well-written, although there are a few areas that could use
clarification, as described below.
Ln. 40 – “outpouring of literature” – it would be helpful to provide more detail here. Besides reef
fish, in what other animals has this been assessed and what were the results of those studies?
Ln. 69-70. The three questions the authors propose are intuitive, but reading further into the
methods, it’s not entirely clear what methods go with what question. I had to re-read the methods
in order to break apart which methods went with which questions. It may be helpful to either
state how each question was assessed at the conclusion of the intro, or separate the methods text
with headings that correspond directly to the 3 questions asked.
Ln. 86. Based on Fig. 1, the high pH appears to be ~7.8. If this is the point of comparison in terms
of diel fluctuations, why was 8.1 used as the “ambient” level?
Ln. 86. Why are the containers sealed?
Ln. 87. Provide details on how and how often pH was measured at the field site. Was this NBS
scale? If so how closely do these correspond to the reported pHT values?
Ln. 92. I’m confused on the seawater conditions for the actual behavioral assays. Were the assays
actually carried out at both pH levels or were the larvae just pre-exposed to the 2 levels of pH and
then assays were conducted at ambient pH? If the latter, this seems like it would affect your
overall conclusions.
Ln. 93 – “= 1 h” – this seems vague. Was there a specific time? It seems as though time would
affect behavioral responses.
Ln. 94 – “Here, we used artificial seawater”. The context is a bit confusing here. Was artificial
seawater used for all experiments or only certain experiments? In these assays, did you adjust
alkalinity of instant ocean to bring it closer to what might be expected in natural seawater?
Ln. 130 – Was the ambient pH level adjusted with the pHstat system as well?
Ln. 155 – It may be helpful early in the results/discussion section to restate what is meant by
behavioral threshold and how this was defined. I had to go back and re-read the methods to
make sense of this.
Ln. 179 – “another crustacean” – which one?
3
Ln. 188 – “appeared higher” – was this significant?
Table 1 – TA is substantially lower at low pH. Could you propose a mechanism for this?
Typically in OA studies, pH remains fairly constant regardless of pH.

See Appendix D.
cidification and GABA independently alter kairomone-induced behaviour”
CL Charpentier & JH Cohen
is manuscript reports on the results of a laboratory study testing for effects of decreased pH
0.5) and gabazine on the ability of crab larvae to detect predator chemical cues (fish
romones) and ultimately initiate a vertical migration to deeper waters. The authors report that
b larvae respond to kairomones by initiating a vertical descent at lower light intensities
ehavioural threshold”; ~2× lower) than larvae not exposed to kairomones under ambient
.1) pH conditions. Exposure to gabazine negated this kairomone response, as the behavioural
eshold with and without kairomones in gabazine-treated crabs was similar to that of control
ditions. The authors also suggest that acidification reduced the kairomone-induced changes in
behavioural threshold, although I cannot see from the statistical analysis and reporting of the
ults where this interpretation comes from (see specific comments).
e manuscript contributes novel information and is quite unique, is fairly well written (with the
eption of some parts of the results that are difficult to follow), and the statistical analyses, for
most part, appear reasonable. I also commend the authors for the addition of measurements
t aid in understanding biological responses to CO2-induced acidification, including the
ailed measurements of Cl- fluxes under different pH conditions.
o have some concerns about aspects of the methodology (use of gabazine) that may have
luenced the results and interpretation in the context of ocean acidification that need to be
ressed. Furthermore, I think that some parts of the manuscript could benefit from increasing
rity and expanding the level of detail provided, given that the manuscript is no longer under
length restrictions of Biology Letters (as per authors’ cover letter). As such, I recommend that
manuscript be accepted after a thorough revision. I have provided some general and specific
mments below that should aid in revising the manuscript.
he introduction is very well written and provides a high level of detail. However, the authors
to introduce (or discuss) results similar to their own which have been reported previously.
milton et al. (2014) found similar effects of gabazine in rockfish, where gabazine treated fish
ibited anxiety responses consistent with those observed under elevated CO2 (also in contrast
he Nilsson et al. hypothesis). This study should be considered in the introduction, discussion,
interpretation of the results.
The Methods section would benefit from a section describing all of the statistical analyses
d to test the various hypotheses, along with significance thresholds and software used. In the
e vein, the reporting of statistical results is currently restricted to p-values, and full statistical
ails are not reported such that the reader cannot replicate the experimental design from
istical output and ensure that proper analyses have been conducted. At the very least, the
hors should report relevant degrees of freedom and test statistic values along with p-values
ughout the manuscript.
o in the methods, some mention of how and when the animals were collected, fed, and
sed is needed.
he results are unclear and a bit confusing at points. Specific examples are highlighted below.
hors should take care to ensure that the reader can fully understand the results and
rpretation.
The Discussion would benefit from some recognition of the limitations of this study along
h a concluding paragraph to consolidate the results and authors’ interpretations/conclusions.
cific comments (P = page, L = lines):
roduction
2, L39: “Decreases of this magnitude can alter sensation…”
P2, L41: “Such changes may…” <U+F0E0> Back this up with a reference. I’d suggest reading
elkergken & Munday (2016).
P3, L53. But see Hamilton et al. (2014)
P4, L77: How long were crabs acclimated in the dark for? What were the seawater chemical
ditions during this acclimation period?
4, L82: With respect to post-hoc tests: I’m not familiar with Holm-Šidák post-hoc tests, but
st post-hoc tests require a p-value correction. Were p-value corrections applied here? These
uld be necessary given the experimental design and use of post-hoc tests to determine
avioural thresholds.
P4, L87: Why only a 24 h acclimation period? Most studies rear animals in experimental
ditions for a period far longer than 24 h, as ocean acidification effects on seawater pH and
2 are likely to be long term. While the authors observed different kairomone-induced
onses under ambient and low pH, could the short acclimation period have influenced the
azine results?
P4, L90: Why was heart rate measured? There is no indication of what this means in light of
core questions of the study.
. P5, L94: Has the pharmacology of gabazine in marine crustaceans been specifically
blished? Theat is, is gabazine definitively known to target GABAA receptors in crustaceans,
ould it simply act as a toxin to larval crabs (though the authors hint at toxicity in the heart
and mortality tests reported on P5, L99-100)? Some recognition of this and justification for
ing the effect of gabazine is necessary.
P5, L94: Were all experiments carried out in seawater with ambient pH, or was experimental
water the same as rearing water?
, L95-96: The seawater temperature of the experiments needs to be reported, as temperature
nown to influence the biological responses to acidification. Also, what was the experimental
perature in relation to the seawater temperature where and when the animals were collected?
me explanation of animal collection and husbandry is needed.
P6, L117: Why did the authors use a different larval stage here? How might this influence the
lts and interpretation? This needs to be considered and discussed.
P6, L125-126: Present evidence that corrections did not alter statistical effects in
plementary data.
. P6, L136: Why did you use both NBS and IUPAC scales rather than just one?
P7, L153: A section outlining the statistical analyses employed is needed.
P7, L152: Missing period.
P7, L157: Present full statistical analyses (df, test stats, p-values) here and throughout
nuscript.
i. P7, L158-160: I’m unclear as to the difference between ambient pH and control seawater. Is
pH of the control seawater the same as the ambient pH? I’m assuming that it is, and I assume
the authors mean that when pH was at ambient levels (~8.1), crabs exposed to kairomones
a lower behavioural threshold than crabs not exposed to kairomones. As written, this
tence is a bit confusing and I’d suggest re-writing it to make it clearer, if indeed my
erstanding of the sentence is correct.
gested rewrite: “Under ambient pH conditions (~8.1), the behavioural threshold of
omone-exposed crabs was nearly two times less than crabs not exposed to kairomones.”
ii. P8, L168: Gabazine had the same effect across treatments in which it was employed (i.e., it
ored the response observed in the ambient control). Is it possible that gabazine acted as an
ctory toxin and simply knocked out olfaction in the crabs such that they could not respond to
environmental stimuli? I would think it is possible. This is important to consider, especially
en the authors’ conclusion that CO2-induced acidification may not be acting on GABAA
ctioning (at least Cl- flux) in these crabs, but may act on kairomone chemoreception.
P9, L197: Although such diel fluctuations are not ubiquitous. From personal experience,
stal and estuarine pH cycles can vary to drastic degree on both small and large spatial scales.
ntrasting cycles are also reported in the primary literature and can be attributed to processes
er than biological activity acting on coastal and estuarine carbonate dynamics.
hould also be noted that the diel cycles that the authors discuss are obtained from what
ears to be 4, single point pH measurements over the course of a single day. I’m assuming that
weather was generally fair during sampling and that it did not rain at any point over their
pling period (otherwise their measurements could not speak to diel cycles). This is by no
ans intensive sampling and the degree of precision to which the authors’ measurements can
dict and describe the diel fluctuations of the area are most certainly limited. This should be
ed in the manuscript where diel pH cycles are discussed given that this was the basis for the
treatments employed.
The manuscript would benefit from a concluding paragraph to consolidate the results and
clusions.

ponse to Reviewers’ Comments
nuscript ID: RSOS-160311
We thank the associate editor and reviewers for their valuable comments on our
nuscript. In response, we have made several changes in this revision. To summarize, first, we
e included additional detail in the introduction to elaborate upon the wide range of recent
rature on our topic. Second, we have attempted to clarify several concerns about seawater
mistry. Specifically, the revised MS includes a more detailed explanation of the experimental
rearing conditions (e.g. seawater type, temperature) and how we selected an appropriate pH
ge. We have also added a document containing supplementary material to address concerns
ut carbonate chemistry and extracellular chloride analysis. Lastly, we have clearly identified
limitations of our study (e.g. unknown aspects of gabazine’s pharmacology) to provide
ders with a realistic sense of potential caveats. For further detail, please see below, where we
e responded to each of the reviewers’ concerns and suggestions. Our responses to each of the
iewers’ comments are denoted in red, underneath the respective reviewer comment.
dressing comments from Reviewer 1:
mments to the Author(s)
manuscript by Charpentier & Cohen describes the effect of acidification and a GABA
agonist on behavior of a larval crab. The authors convincingly show a mechanism that runs
nter to the prevailing view in the literature, and therefore the results would be useful and of
rest to the ocean acidification and larval behavior communities. Overall, the manuscript is
ntifically sound (see specific comments below) and the authors do not over-interpret their
ults. The manuscript is generally well-written, although there are a few areas that could use
ification, as described below.
40 – “outpouring of literature” – it would be helpful to provide more detail here. Besides reef
, in what other animals has this been assessed and what were the results of those studies?
We have added several examples to provide further detail on the range of affected
sory and behavioural processes and the variety of animals in which these effects have been
erved.
“To name a few, these low pH conditions can inhibit or alter olfaction [3,4,5,6], vision
[7], auditory function [8], lateralization [9,10], anti-predator behaviour [11,12], visual
risk assessment [13], foraging behaviour [14,15,16], shell assessment/homing or
settlement ability [17,18,19], and learning [20] in marine fish, crustaceans, and mollusks
from both tropical and temperate environments.” (Lines 41 – 45)
69-70. The three questions the authors propose are intuitive, but reading further into the
hods, it’s not entirely clear what methods go with what question. I had to re-read the methods
rder to break apart which methods went with which questions. It may be helpful to either
e how each question was assessed at the conclusion of the intro, or separate the methods text
h headings that correspond directly to the 3 questions asked.
As suggested, we now describe how each question was assessed at the conclusion of the
oduction:
“With larval H. sanguineus, we assessed (1) if decreases in pH alter the kairomone effect
to photobehaviour over a diel/tidal timescale using a behavioural assay with two pH
treatments, (2) whether GABAergic signalling plays a role in the kairomone effect with a
second assay assessing the dose-response relationship of gabazine to photobehaviour, and
(3) if our results support Nilsson et al.’s GABA hypothesis with the above behavioural
assays and a comparison of extracellular Cl- concentrations.” (Lines 74 – 79)
To further clarify, we have also split up the behavioural experiments section of the
hods into two subsections, entitled, ‘2.2.1 The pH experiment’ (lines 114 – 150) and ‘2.2.2.
gabazine dose-response experiment’ (lines 151 – 156).
86. Based on Fig. 1, the high pH appears to be ~7.8. If this is the point of comparison in
ms of diel fluctuations, why was 8.1 used as the “ambient” level?
Hemigrapsus sanguineus undergo offshore transport during larval development, and
ae of all stages have been found on the continental shelf offshore of Delaware and Maryland
ifanio et al. 2013). In September 2014, when larval H. sanguineus would have been abundant
ifanio et al. 2013), daytime pH ranged from 7.9 to 8.1 on the continental shelf of the mid
antic (New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland; Barbero et al., 2016). In addition, much of the
vious work testing behavioural changes in animals exposed to acidified seawater used an
bient or control pH of 8.0-8.2, including tropical and temperate fish, crustaceans, and
llusks (e.g. Bibby et al. 2007; de la Haye et al. 2012; Dixson et al. 2010; Hamilton et al. 2014;
tson et al. 2014). Hence, our chosen “ambient” treatment reflects relevant pH values for
al H. sanguineus habitat, and can be easily compared to previous work that assesses similar
-mediated changes to behaviour. Further, we chose 7.6 for our low pH treatment, because
httime values of pH may be as low as 7.7 on the shelf (Barbero et al., 2016) and 7.5 at our
ection site (Fig. 1). The manuscript now includes text that outlines how we selected our pH
tments, including relevant references:
“To choose an appropriate pH range, we measured pH at the site of H. sanguineus
collection, Roosevelt Inlet, Lewes, DE, and reviewed open access pH data from a
relevant offshore environment…” (Lines 120 – 122)
“…Our ambient treatment reflects daytime pH values found on the continental shelf of
the mid-Atlantic (7.9-8.1) [33], where H. sanguineus spend much of their larval
development [34]. We chose a low pH of 7.6 to exemplify the minimum pH these
animals may experience during embryonic development, transport, and diel changes in
pH in this coastal environment (figure 1; [33]).” (Lines 128 – 133)

86. Why are the containers sealed?
During the time of exposure to each pH treatment, containers were sealed to reduce
hange of gas or dust particles with the surrounding environment. We have included this
cription in the revised MS to clarify:
“These containers were sealed to reduce exchange of gas or dust particles with the
surrounding environment.” (Lines 119 – 120)
87. Provide details on how and how often pH was measured at the field site. Was this NBS
le? If so how closely do these correspond to the reported pHT values?
In the revised manuscript, we provide details on the procedure used to obtain the pH
asurements shown in Figure 1 (see text below). We deployed a YSI Sonde with fast-response
sensor to measure pH, which uses an NBS scale. When comparing pH values used in our
avioural experiments, the mean standard deviation between values measured on an NBS scale
calculated pHT values was 0.06 in the ambient pH treatment and 0.09 in the low pH
tment. Further, if we assume that pHT is closest to the actual pH value, this translates into a
an percent error of < 2% in both treatments. Admittedly, it is not ideal to include pH values of
different scales. The revised MS summarizes the above error analysis to provide the reader
h an accurate sense of this caveat.
“Further, on July 9th, 2015, we measured pH in Roosevelt Inlet, Lewes, DE at four time
points throughout the day (6600-V2 sonde with 6589 Fast-Response pH sensor; YSI
Incorporated, Yellow Springs, OH, USA) (figure 1). This potentiometric electrode
measures pH on the NBS scale. We recognize that this method is not ideal for
measurement of seawater pH [31,32]. However, when comparing pH values during our
behavioural experiment, the percent error between pH measured on the NBS scale and
the total pH scale (pHT; described in further detail below) was < 2%.” (Lines 122 – 128)

92. I’m confused on the seawater conditions for the actual behavioral assays. Were the
ays actually carried out at both pH levels or were the larvae just pre-exposed to the 2 levels of
and then assays were conducted at ambient pH? If the latter, this seems like it would affect
r overall conclusions.
During behavioural assays, larvae were maintained in the seawater from their respective
treatments. To add clarity to this confusion, the revised MS includes the below text:
“Throughout the experiment, larvae were maintained in their respective pH treatments,
where the “control” signifies no addition of kairomones or gabazine.” (Lines 141 – 142)
93 – “= 1 h” – this seems vague. Was there a specific time? It seems as though time would
ct behavioral responses.
Prior to behavioural experiments, animals were exposed to kairomone and gabazine
tments for 1 – 3 h, exposure durations which we have shown previously to result in an
ivalent kairomone effect. We have clarified this in the text. (Lines 139, 155)
94 – “Here, we used artificial seawater”. The context is a bit confusing here. Was artificial
water used for all experiments or only certain experiments? In these assays, did you adjust
alinity of instant ocean to bring it closer to what might be expected in natural seawater?
In the original MS, we were trying to highlight that two types of seawater were used,
ficial seawater in the pH experiment and filtered/aged seawater in the dose-response
eriment. In the revised MS, we have removed the sentence referenced above and added a
arate paragraph in section ‘2.4. Seawater chemistry’ of the methods, dedicated to clarifying
point.
“In all experiments, we controlled for…” (Lines 185 – 192)
Also, we did not adjust the alkalinity of instant ocean to match expected values in natural
water. Since alkalinity is generally conservative and namely changes with salinity, we
umed that matching the salinities of the ambient and low pH treatment would result in similar
values. Please see our response to the comment about Table 1 below for further explanation.
130 – Was the ambient pH level adjusted with the pHstat system as well?
Due to constraints of laboratory space and sampling time, we were not able to adjust the
bient pH with the pH/CO2 stat system. Rather, we used the same salinity and Instant Ocean
ficial seawater mix to obtain carbonate parameters as similar as possible. This clarification
been added to the revised MS:
“Due to spatial and temporal constraints, the ambient pH was not regulated with the
described pH/CO2 stat system. However, we used the same salinity and artificial seawater
mix in both to obtain similar carbonate parameters.” (Lines 197 – 200)
155 – It may be helpful early in the results/discussion section to restate what is meant by
avioral threshold and how this was defined. I had to go back and re-read the methods to make
se of this.
We agree, and the results and discussion section now opens with:
“We assessed the effect of pH and the role of GABAergic signalling in kairomone-
induced changes to photobehaviour by comparing the behavioural threshold, i.e. the
lowest light intensity to elicit a descent response, between pH and kairomone/gabazine
treatments.” (Lines 223 – 225)
179 – “another crustacean” – which one?
The study referenced here examined the role of GABAergic signaling in olfaction of the
ny lobster. The revised MS now states:
“In the spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, opening of GABAA receptors…” (Lines 255 –
257)
188 – “appeared higher” – was this significant?
The sample size in our paired osmolality-chloride experiment was too low (n = 2) for
ust statistical analysis. We clarify this point in the revised MS:
“Though our small sample size (n = 2) inhibited robust statistical analysis, osmolality
appeared higher at low pH (table 3), suggesting an increase of other osmolytes, which
could include HCO3-.” (Lines 265 – 267)
le 1 – TA is substantially lower at low pH. Could you propose a mechanism for this?
ically in OA studies, TA remains fairly constant regardless of pH.
In the revised MS, we have added a section to propose a mechanism for the observed
erences in TA in the supplementary materials, entitled ‘2.4. Seawater chemistry’. This
ition is referenced in the main document:
“Though values of TA are higher than would be expected at a salinity of 32 in the
ambient pH treatment (table 1), our pH calculations and results should not be affected by
this difference (details in electronic supplementary material).” (Lines 217 – 220)
dressing comments from Reviewer 2:
s manuscript reports on the results of a laboratory study testing for effects of decreased pH
0.5) and gabazine on the ability of crab larvae to detect predator chemical cues (fish
romones) and ultimately initiate a vertical migration to deeper waters. The authors report that
b larvae respond to kairomones by initiating a vertical descent at lower light intensities

.1) pH conditions. Exposure to gabazine negated this kairomone response, as the behavioural
shold with and without kairomones in gabazine-treated crabs was similar to that of control
ditions. The authors also suggest that acidification reduced the kairomone-induced changes in
behavioural threshold, although I cannot see from the statistical analysis and reporting of the
ults where this interpretation comes from (see specific comments).
manuscript contributes novel information and is quite unique, is fairly well written (with the
eption of some parts of the results that are difficult to follow), and the statistical analyses, for
most part, appear reasonable. I also commend the authors for the addition of measurements

ailed measurements of Cl- fluxes under different pH conditions.
have some concerns about aspects of the methodology (use of gabazine) that may have
uenced the results and interpretation in the context of ocean acidification that need to be
ressed. Furthermore, I think that some parts of the manuscript could benefit from increasing
ity and expanding the level of detail provided, given that the manuscript is no longer under
length restrictions of Biology Letters (as per authors’ cover letter). As such, I recommend
the manuscript be accepted after a thorough revision. I have provided some general and
cific comments below that should aid in revising the manuscript.
neral comments:

to introduce (or discuss) results similar to their own which have been reported previously.
milton et al. (2014) found similar effects of gabazine in rockfish, where gabazine treated fish
ibited anxiety responses consistent with those observed under elevated CO2 (also in contrast
he Nilsson et al. hypothesis). This study should be considered in the introduction, discussion,
interpretation of the results.
In the revised MS, we have included the findings of Hamilton et al. (2014) in the
oduction and further assessed their relativity to our study in the results and discussion section
e text below).

“Hamilton et al. [26] similarly found that gabazine did not reverse increases in anxiety after
exposure to acidified seawater in a juvenile fish. However, a GABA agonist, muscimol,

changes to the ‘normal’ function of this agonist ultimately support Nilsson et al.’s
hypothesis of reversed function of GABAA receptors in acidified conditions.” (Lines 238 –

he Methods section would benefit from a section describing all of the statistical analyses

e vein, the reporting of statistical results is currently restricted to p-values, and full statistical
ails are not reported such that the reader cannot replicate the experimental design from

We have added several clarifications to address your concerns below, e.g. confusion

he Discussion would benefit from some recognition of the limitations of this study along
h a concluding paragraph to consolidate the results and authors’ interpretations/conclusions.
The revised MS includes limitations on our interpretation of the role of gabazine as well
ield pH measurements to address this concern (see text below). In addition, we have added a
clusion section following our results and discussion (lines 293 – 309).
“Though, we used gabazine concentrations far below known thresholds for toxicity in
another crustacean zooplankter (Daphnia) [53] and we found no difference in heart rate or
mortality after gabazine exposure, we cannot entirely eliminate the possibility that gabazine
may be acting as an olfactory toxin in these larval crabs.” (Lines 273 – 276)
“We found a similar pattern at our H. sanguineus collection site (figure 1), and the observed
pH effects to behaviour occurred over a timescale similar to these cycles. Since our pH
measurements were taken over the course of one day with fair weather, we recognize that
pH cycles may also vary over small and large spatial scales and change with processes other
than biological activity (e.g. river and groundwater input) [54].” (Lines 278 – 283)

As described in the above general comments section, we have added the findings of
milton et al. (2014) to the introduction.
“…though gabazine did not reverse increases in anxiety after exposure to acidified
seawater in a juvenile rockfish [26].” (Lines 58 – 59)
thods
P4, L77: How long were crabs acclimated in the dark for? What were the seawater chemical
ditions during this acclimation period?
The revised MS includes clarification for both of these questions:
“Animals were dark-acclimated within their respective treatments for 1 – 3 h.“ (Line 95)
“After 12 h of exposure, larvae from both pH treatments were additionally exposed to the
control, kairomones, gabazine (10 µM; SR-95531; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA),
and kairomones with gabazine for 1 – 3 h before we conducted assays to determine
behavioural thresholds for each treatment. …Throughout the experiment, larvae were
maintained in their respective pH treatments, where ‘control’ signifies no addition of
kairomones or gabazine.” (Lines 137 – 142)
4, L82: With respect to post-hoc tests: I’m not familiar with Holm-Šidák post-hoc tests, but
st post-hoc tests require a p-value correction. Were p-value corrections applied here? These
uld be necessary given the experimental design and use of post-hoc tests to determine
avioural thresholds.
We agree, and the Holm-Šidák method does apply a p-value correction.
P4, L87: Why only a 24 h acclimation period? Most studies rear animals in experimental
ditions for a period far longer than 24 h, as ocean acidification effects on seawater pH and
2 are likely to be long term. While the authors observed different kairomone-induced
ponses under ambient and low pH, could the short acclimation period have influenced the
azine results?
We actually acclimated animals to pH treatments for just 12 h (lines 117 – 118). These
rt time periods were meant to reflect timescales over which estuarine and coastal animals
erience diel/tidal changes in pH. Hence, our study focused on present-day pH fluctuations
er than global, long-term ocean acidification. After a longer acclimatisation period, it is
sible that the role of GABAergic signaling, and therefore the effect of gabazine, might differ
he physiology of the animal as a whole has more time to adjust (e.g. acid-base regulation).
wever, such a test is outside of the aim of this study, which was in part to assess whether
creases in pH alter the kairomone effect to photobehaviour over a diel/tidal timescale” (lines
– 75). To clarify at this point in the methods, we have added an additional sentence:
“This exposure represents the timescale over which diel/tidal pH cycles occur [27].”

P4, L90: Why was heart rate measured? There is no indication of what this means in light of
core questions of the study.
Heart rate measurements were taken to ensure that there were no apparent differences in
animals’ health (i.e. physiological condition) after a 12 h of exposure to pH treatments. For
ance, changes to heart rate might indicate differences in condition, metabolism, or stress.
nce, the goal of these measurements was to determine whether animals from both treatments
e in a similar condition before behavioural assays rather than to contribute directly to the core
stions of the study. The revised MS includes further explanation concerning the purposes of
se measurements:
“We randomly selected 10 individuals from each pH treatment and found no difference in
heart rate before and after pH exposure (t(7) = 0.8, P = 0.4; t-test), suggesting that there
was no apparent difference in physiological condition between pH treatments prior to
behavioural assays.” (Lines 134 – 137)
. P5, L94: Has the pharmacology of gabazine in marine crustaceans been specifically
blished? That is, is gabazine definitively known to target GABAA receptors in crustaceans,
ould it simply act as a toxin to larval crabs (though the authors hint at toxicity in the heart
and mortality tests reported on P5, L99-100)? Some recognition of this and justification for
ing the effect of gabazine is necessary.
To our knowledge, little work has been done to determine the pharmacology of gabazine
marine crustaceans. However, we found little reason to assume that the chosen gabazine
centration in this study was toxic, given the results of preliminary experiments assessing
rtality and heart rate over time (referenced below).
Although Barry (2002) found evidence to suggest that gabazine only acts as a GABA
agonist at nearly toxic concentrations in Daphnia, a freshwater crustacean, and Jackel et al.
94) determined that gabazine had no effect on the thoracic neurons of a marine lobster at
se low, non-toxic concentrations, several studies indicate that gabazine functions as a
petitive antagonist in other arthropods, e.g. fruitfly, Drosophila (Hosie and Sattelle, 1996)
locust, Locusta migratoria (Janssen et al., 2010). We have added our justification to the
ised MS:
“Preliminary experiments indicated that 10-µM gabazine had no effect on heart rate or
survival (t(8) = 0.1, P = 0.9; t-test), suggesting that gabazine at this concentration was not
toxic to these crab larvae. Further, we chose to use gabazine to inhibit GABAergic
signaling in this study because gabazine has effectively reversed the effects of
acidification in both vertebrates and invertebrates, e.g. [22,25] and gabazine functions as
a competitive antagonist in other arthropods, e.g. fruitfly, Drosophila [36] and locust,
Locusta migratoria [37].” (Lines 144 – 150)

P5, L94: Were all experiments carried out in seawater with ambient pH, or was experimental
water the same as rearing water?
In the pH experiment, all animals were reared in seawater at ambient pH. As described in
response to the above question about exposure time, 12 h prior to behavioural assays,
mals were exposed to either ambient or low pH. Animals remained in their respective pH
tments throughout the duration of the experiment. In the dose-response experiment, all
mals were reared at ambient pH and remained in this water during experiments. To clarify this
cern in the revised MS, we have included further explanation (see text below):
“…and all animals were reared at ambient pH (~ 8.1).” (Lines 87 – 88)
“Throughout the experiment, larvae were maintained in their respective pH treatments,
where ‘control’ signifies no addition of kairomones or gabazine.” (Lines 141 – 142)
5, L95-96: The seawater temperature of the experiments needs to be reported, as temperature
nown to influence the biological responses to acidification. Also, what was the experimental
perature in relation to the seawater temperature where and when the animals were collected?
me explanation of animal collection and husbandry is needed.
The revised MS includes a description of the temperature during animal collection,
ring, and experiments (see text below). In addition, we have added a section entitled ‘2.1.
mal collection and rearing’ (Lines 82 – 89) to address this comment.
“In September of 2014 and 2015, ovigerous female Hemigrapsus sanguineus (De Haan
1853) were collected from Roosevelt Inlet, DE, USA. Water temperature ranged from 18
– 23 °C during this time. We kept these females in the laboratory under a 14 h:10 h
light:dark cycle at ~ 22 °C in seawater at a salinity of 32 practical salinity units (psu).”

“All experiments were conducted at the same temperature in which animals were reared
(22 °C).” (Lines 97 – 98)
P6, L117: Why did the authors use a different larval stage here? How might this influence the
ults and interpretation? This needs to be considered and discussed.
We used a younger larval stage in the paired chloride-osmolality experiment to increase
number of individuals per sample, and therefore extracellular fluid (ECF) volume. Since zoea
oth beginning and intermediate stages are osmoconformers over the chosen salinity range
ger et al., 2008), the use of younger zoea should not change our interpretation. We have
ed a statement to the revised MS to address this issue:
“Contrary to the behavioural experiments, we used first-stage zoeae in this chloride-
osmolality analysis to increase the ECF sample volume, as some broods experience high
mortality over larval development (e.g. due to maternal effects) [39]. Since zoeae are
osmoconformers at both beginning and intermediate stages of development [38], the use
of younger zoeae should not change our interpretation.” (Lines 179 – 183)

In the revised MS, we have included our full statistical analyses, as suggested. Further,
all RM ANOVAs, the degrees of freedom are the same within each behavioural assay (pH
eriment, dose-response experiment). Hence, we include the range of F-values with
responding degrees of freedom as well as the range of P-values for each of these two

was 1.28 × 1012 photons m-2 s-1 (P = 0.03; Holm-Šidák post hoc test), nearly two times
less than those not exposed to kairomones (2.55 × 1012 photons m-2 s-1; P = 0.006; figure

2b). Addition of gabazine with and without kairomones also resulted in the same
threshold as the control, regardless of pH (P < 0.04; figure 2c,d).” (Lines 225 – 232)
“Again, percentage descending was greater after light stimulation than in darkness
(F(5,6) = 8.0-17.8, P < 0.001, one-way RM ANOVA. Here, the behavioural threshold
was lower in larvae exposed to kairomones (P = 0.013; Holm-Šidák post hoc test) and
kairomones with gabazine at the lowest concentration (0.1 µM; P = 0.017), compared to
those exposed to the control, gabazine-only, and kairomones with gabazine at higher
concentrations (10, 1 µM; P < 0.02; table 2).” (Lines 245 – 250)
“Contrary to this hypothesis, extracellular Cl- did not vary between larvae exposed to
ambient or low pH, with mean ± se concentrations of 292 ± 63 and 282 ± 94 mM,
respectively (n = 5; t-test, t(8) = 0.08, P = 0.9).” (Lines 261 – 263)
i. P7, L158-160: I’m unclear as to the difference between ambient pH and control seawater. Is
pH of the control seawater the same as the ambient pH? I’m assuming that it is, and I assume
the authors mean that when pH was at ambient levels (~8.1), crabs exposed to kairomones
a lower behavioural threshold than crabs not exposed to kairomones. As written, this
tence is a bit confusing and I’d suggest re-writing it to make it clearer, if indeed my
erstanding of the sentence is correct.
gested rewrite: “Under ambient pH conditions (~8.1), the behavioural threshold of
romone-exposed crabs was nearly two times less than crabs not exposed to kairomones.”
The above assumption is correct. We have revised this sentence to clarify, as suggested:
“Under ambient pH conditions (~8.1), the behavioural threshold of kairomone-exposed
larvae was 1.28 × 1012 photons m-2 s-1 (P = 0.03, Holm-Šidák post hoc test), nearly two
times less than those not exposed to kairomones (2.55 × 1012 photons m-2 s-1; P = 0.006;
figure 2a).” (Lines 227 – 230)
In addition, we removed the term “control seawater” from the text entirely. Instead, we
e added a sentence to the ‘2.2.1 The pH experiment’ section of the methods to clarify:
“Throughout the experiment, larvae were maintained in their respective pH treatments,
where the ‘control’ signifies no addition of kairomones or gabazine.” (Line 141 – 142)
ii. P8, L168: Gabazine had the same effect across treatments in which it was employed (i.e., it
ored the response observed in the ambient control). Is it possible that gabazine acted as an
ctory toxin and simply knocked out olfaction in the crabs such that they could not respond to
environmental stimuli? I would think it is possible. This is important to consider, especially
en the authors’ conclusion that CO2-induced acidification may not be acting on GABAA
ctioning (at least Cl- flux) in these crabs, but may act on kairomone chemoreception.
In the revised MS, recognize this possibility (see text below).
“Though, we used gabazine concentrations far below known thresholds for toxicity in
another crustacean zooplankter (Daphnia) [53] and we found no difference in heart rate
or mortality after gabazine exposure, we cannot entirely eliminate the possibility that
gabazine may be acting as an olfactory toxin in these larval crabs.” (Lines 273 – 276)

. P9, L197: Although such diel fluctuations are not ubiquitous. From personal experience,
stal and estuarine pH cycles can vary to drastic degree on both small and large spatial scales.
ntrasting cycles are also reported in the primary literature and can be attributed to processes
er than biological activity acting on coastal and estuarine carbonate dynamics.
hould also be noted that the diel cycles that the authors discuss are obtained from what
ears to be 4, single point pH measurements over the course of a single day. I’m assuming that
weather was generally fair during sampling and that it did not rain at any point over their
pling period (otherwise their measurements could not speak to diel cycles). This is by no
ans intensive sampling and the degree of precision to which the authors’ measurements can
dict and describe the diel fluctuations of the area are most certainly limited. This should be
ed in the manuscript where diel pH cycles are discussed given that this was the basis for the
treatments employed.
In the revised MS, we have made note of this limitation and that multiple processes
act pH cycling in coastal habitats:
“We found a similar pattern at our H. sanguineus collection site (figure 1), and the observed
pH effects to behaviour occurred over a timescale similar to these cycles. Since our pH
measurements were taken over the course of one day with fair weather, we recognize that
pH cycles may also vary over small and large spatial scales and fluctuate due to processes
other than biological activity (e.g. river and groundwater input) [55].” (Lines 278 – 283)

mments to the Author(s)
e manuscript by Charpentier & Cohen describes the effect of acidification and a GABA
agonist on behavior of a larval crab. The authors convincingly show a mechanism that runs
nter to the prevailing view in the literature, and therefore the results would be useful and of
erest to the ocean acidification and larval behavior communities. Overall, the manuscript is
entifically sound (see specific comments below) and the authors do not over-interpret their
ults. The manuscript is generally well-written, although there are a few areas that could use
rification, as described below.
. 40 – “outpouring of literature” – it would be helpful to provide more detail here. Besides reef
h, in what other animals has this been assessed and what were the results of those studies?
Response: We have added several examples to provide further detail on the range of
affected sensory and behavioural processes and the variety of animals in which these
effects have been observed. “To name a few, these low pH conditions can inhibit or alter
olfaction [3,4,5,6], vision [7], auditory function [8], lateralization [9,10], anti-predator
behaviour [11,12], visual risk assessment [13], foraging behaviour [14,15,16], shell
assessment/homing or settlement ability [17,18,19], and learning [20] in marine fish,
crustaceans, and mollusks from both tropical and temperate environments.” (Lines 41 –
45)
Good. The additional information and references to specific studies addresses this
comment well. However, in the first sentence, the authors may want to recognize that
the decrease in oceanic pH is due to an increase in oceanic CO 2 and subsequent
alterations in the marine carbonate system. In addition, the bulk of behavioural
changes are thought to be the result of elevated CO 2 and not necessarily a drop in pH.
Some mention of this would enhance clarification in the paper’s opening.
. 69-70. The three questions the authors propose are intuitive, but reading further into the
thods, it’s not entirely clear what methods go with what question. I had to re-read the methods
order to break apart which methods went with which questions. It may be helpful to either
te how each question was assessed at the conclusion of the intro, or separate the methods text
h headings that correspond directly to the 3 questions asked.
Response: As suggested, we now describe how each question was assessed at the
conclusion of the introduction:
“With larval H. sanguineus, we assessed (1) if decreases in pH alter the kairomone effect
to photobehaviour over a diel/tidal timescale using a behavioural assay with two pH
treatments, (2) whether GABAergic signalling plays a role in the kairomone effect with a
second assay assessing the dose-response relationship of gabazine to photobehaviour, and
(3) if our results support Nilsson et al.’s GABA hypothesis with the above behavioural
assays and a comparison of extracellular Cl- concentrations.” (Lines 74 – 79)
To further clarify, we have also split up the behavioural experiments section of the
methods into two subsections, entitled, ‘2.2.1 The pH experiment’ (lines 114 – 150) and
‘2.2.2. The gabazine dose-response experiment’ (lines 151 – 156).
Good. This comment has been well addressed.
. 86. Based on Fig. 1, the high pH appears to be ~7.8. If this is the point of comparison in
ms of diel fluctuations, why was 8.1 used as the “ambient” level?
Response: Hemigrapsus sanguineus undergo offshore transport during larval
development, and zoeae of all stages have been found on the continental shelf offshore of
Delaware and Maryland (Epifanio et al. 2013). In September 2014, when larval H.
sanguineus would have been abundant (Epifanio et al. 2013), daytime pH ranged from
7.9 to 8.1 on the continental shelf of the mid Atlantic (New Jersey, Delaware, and
Maryland; Barbero et al., 2016). In addition, much of the previous work testing
behavioural changes in animals exposed to acidified seawater used an ambient or control
pH of 8.0-8.2, including tropical and temperate fish, crustaceans, and mollusks (e.g.
Bibby et al. 2007; de la Haye et al. 2012; Dixson et al. 2010; Hamilton et al. 2014;
Watson et al. 2014). Hence, our chosen “ambient” treatment reflects relevant pH values
for larval H. sanguineus habitat, and can be easily compared to previous work that
assesses similar pH-mediated changes to behaviour. Further, we chose 7.6 for our low pH
treatment, because nighttime values of pH may be as low as 7.7 on the shelf (Barbero et
al., 2016) and 7.5 at our collection site (Fig. 1). The manuscript now includes text that
outlines how we selected our pH treatments, including relevant references:
“To choose an appropriate pH range, we measured pH at the site of H. sanguineus
collection, Roosevelt Inlet, Lewes, DE, and reviewed open access pH data from a
relevant offshore environment…” (Lines 120 – 122) “…Our ambient treatment reflects
daytime pH values found on the continental shelf of the mid-Atlantic (7.9-8.1) [33],
where H. sanguineus spend much of their larval development [34]. We chose a low pH of
7.6 to exemplify the minimum pH these animals may experience during embryonic
development, transport, and diel changes in pH in this coastal environment (figure 1;
[33]).” (Lines 128 – 133)

Justification for pH treatments is now addressed, but it is now unclear as to how these
chosen pH levels correspond to future ocean acidification. A short sentence to indicate
that one might expect H. sanguineus to experience pH conditions at or below the
current minimum under future ocean acidification is warranted here.
. 86. Why are the containers sealed?
Response: During the time of exposure to each pH treatment, containers were sealed to
reduce exchange of gas or dust particles with the surrounding environment. We have
included this description in the revised MS to clarify: “These containers were sealed to
reduce exchange of gas or dust particles with the surrounding environment.” (Lines 119 –
120)
Good. A statement to reassure the reader that other abiotic conditions (e.g. oxygen,
temperature, and salinity) did not change over the course of the experiment would be
good to add here (assuming that they didn’t…). If some conditions weren’t measured,
it might be good to find literature using closed containers in similar experiments to
ensure that other confounding variables could not have impacted the results.
. 87. Provide details on how and how often pH was measured at the field site. Was this NBS
le? If so how closely do these correspond to the reported pH T values?
Response: In the revised manuscript, we provide details on the procedure used to obtain
the pH measurements shown in Figure 1 (see text below). We deployed a YSI Sonde with
fast-response pH sensor to measure pH, which uses an NBS scale. When comparing pH
values used in our behavioural experiments, the mean standard deviation between values
measured on an NBS scale and calculated pH T values was 0.06 in the ambient pH
treatment and 0.09 in the low pH treatment. Further, if we assume that pH T is closest to
the actual pH value, this translates into a mean percent error of < 2% in both treatments.
Admittedly, it is not ideal to include pH values of two different scales. The revised MS
summarizes the above error analysis to provide the reader with an accurate sense of this
caveat.
“Further, on July 9th, 2015, we measured pH in Roosevelt Inlet, Lewes, DE at four time
points throughout the day (6600-V2 sonde with 6589 Fast-Response pH sensor; YSI
Incorporated, Yellow Springs, OH, USA) (figure 1). This potentiometric electrode
measures pH on the NBS scale. We recognize that this method is not ideal for
measurement of seawater pH [31,32]. However, when comparing pH values during our
behavioural experiment, the percent error between pH measured on the NBS scale and
the total pH scale (pHT; described in further detail below) was < 2%.” (Lines 122 – 128)

Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
. 92. I’m confused on the seawater conditions for the actual behavioral assays. Were the
ays actually carried out at both pH levels or were the larvae just pre-exposed to the 2 levels of
and then assays were conducted at ambient pH? If the latter, this seems like it would affect
ur overall conclusions.
Response: During behavioural assays, larvae were maintained in the seawater from their
respective pH treatments. To add clarity to this confusion, the revised MS includes the
below text:
“Throughout the experiment, larvae were maintained in their respective pH treatments,
where the “control” signifies no addition of kairomones or gabazine.” (Lines 141 – 142)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
. 93 – “= 1 h” – this seems vague. Was there a specific time? It seems as though time would
ect behavioral responses.
Response: Prior to behavioural experiments, animals were exposed to kairomone and
gabazine treatments for 1 – 3 h, exposure durations which we have shown previously to
result in an equivalent kairomone effect. We have clarified this in the text. (Lines 139,
155)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
. 94 – “Here, we used artificial seawater”. The context is a bit confusing here. Was artificial
water used for all experiments or only certain experiments? In these assays, did you adjust
alinity of instant ocean to bring it closer to what might be expected in natural seawater?
Response: In the original MS, we were trying to highlight that two types of seawater were
used, artificial seawater in the pH experiment and filtered/aged seawater in the dose-
response experiment. In the revised MS, we have removed the sentence referenced above
and added a separate paragraph in section ‘2.4. Seawater chemistry’ of the methods,
dedicated to clarifying this point.
“In all experiments, we controlled for…” (Lines 185 – 192)
Also, we did not adjust the alkalinity of instant ocean to match expected values in natural
seawater. Since alkalinity is generally conservative and namely changes with salinity, we
assumed that matching the salinities of the ambient and low pH treatment would result in
similar TA values. Please see our response to the comment about Table 1 below for
further explanation.
Okay. Although pretty unlikely, it could be possible that the different seawater
conditions resulted in different dose-dependent responses between the pH experiment
and the dose-dependent experiment such that gabazine was toxic in one but not the
other. A mention of this in the discussion surrounding gabazine toxicity is warranted.
. 130 – Was the ambient pH level adjusted with the pHstat system as well?
Response: Due to constraints of laboratory space and sampling time, we were not able to
adjust the ambient pH with the pH/CO2 stat system. Rather, we used the same salinity
and Instant Ocean artificial seawater mix to obtain carbonate parameters as similar as
possible. This clarification has been added to the revised MS: “Due to spatial and
temporal constraints, the ambient pH was not regulated with the described pH/CO 2 stat
system. However, we used the same salinity and artificial seawater mix in both to obtain
similar carbonate parameters.” (Lines 197 – 200)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
. 155 – It may be helpful early in the results/discussion section to restate what is meant by
avioral threshold and how this was defined. I had to go back and re-read the methods to make
se of this.
Response: We agree, and the results and discussion section now opens with:
“We assessed the effect of pH and the role of GABAergic signalling in
kairomoneinduced changes to photobehaviour by comparing the behavioural threshold,
i.e. the lowest light intensity to elicit a descent response, between pH and
kairomone/gabazine treatments.” (Lines 223 – 225)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
. 179 – “another crustacean” – which one? The study referenced here examined the role of
BAergic signaling in olfaction of the spiny lobster.
Response: The revised MS now states: “In the spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, opening of
GABAA receptors…” (Lines 255 – 257)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
. 188 – “appeared higher” – was this significant?
Response: The sample size in our paired osmolality-chloride experiment was too low (n =
2) for robust statistical analysis. We clarify this point in the revised MS: “Though our
small sample size (n = 2) inhibited robust statistical analysis, osmolality appeared higher
at low pH (table 3), suggesting an increase of other osmolytes, which could include
HCO3 - .” (Lines 265 – 267)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
ble 1 – TA is substantially lower at low pH. Could you propose a mechanism for this?
pically in OA studies, TA remains fairly constant regardless of pH.
Response: In the revised MS, we have added a section to propose a mechanism for the
observed differences in TA in the supplementary materials, entitled ‘2.4. Seawater
chemistry’. This addition is referenced in the main document: “Though values of TA are
higher than would be expected at a salinity of 32 in the ambient pH treatment (table 1),
our pH calculations and results should not be affected by this difference (details in
electronic supplementary material).” (Lines 217 – 220)
Good - comment has been addressed sufficiently. However, it should be noted
somewhere in the discussion that the authors cannot isolate the particular carbonate
geochemical parameter driving the results. It might be pH, could be CO2 , and might be
TA (given the stark differences in TA between treatments). A paragraph discussing
how elevated CO2 and associated carbonate parameters impact marine animal
behaviour is warranted in the discussion, along with a mention of treatment-specific
differences in carbonate geochemistry observed in this study. At current, the authors
attribute all effects to pH, but that may not necessarily be the case.

eshold with and without kairomones in gabazine-treated crabs was similar to that of control
ditions. The authors also suggest that acidification reduced the kairomone-induced changes in
behavioural threshold, although I cannot see from the statistical analysis and reporting of the
ults where this interpretation comes from (see specific comments).
e manuscript contributes novel information and is quite unique, is fairly well written (with the
eption of some parts of the results that are difficult to follow), and the statistical analyses, for
most part, appear reasonable. I also commend the authors for the addition of measurements
t aid in understanding biological responses to CO2-induced acidification, including the
ailed measurements of Cl- fluxes under different pH conditions. I do have some concerns
ut aspects of the methodology (use of gabazine) that may have influenced the results and
erpretation in the context of ocean acidification that need to be addressed. Furthermore, I think
t some parts of the manuscript could benefit from increasing clarity and expanding the level
detail provided, given that the manuscript is no longer under the length restrictions of Biology
ters (as per authors’ cover letter). As such, I recommend that the manuscript be accepted after
horough revision. I have provided some general and specific comments below that should aid
evising the manuscript.
neral comments:
The introduction is very well written and provides a high level of detail. However, the authors
to introduce (or discuss) results similar to their own which have been reported previously.
milton et al. (2014) found similar effects of gabazine in rockfish, where gabazine treated fish
ibited anxiety responses consistent with those observed under elevated CO2 (also in contrast
he Nilsson et al. hypothesis). This study should be considered in the introduction, discussion,
interpretation of the results.
Response: In the revised MS, we have included the findings of Hamilton et al. (2014) in
the introduction and further assessed their relativity to our study in the results and
discussion section (see text below).
Introduction “…though gabazine did not reverse increases in anxiety after exposure to
acidified seawater in a juvenile rockfish [26].” (Lines 58 – 59)
Discussion “Hamilton et al. [26] similarly found that gabazine did not reverse increases
in anxiety after exposure to acidified seawater in a juvenile fish. However, a GABA
agonist, muscimol, added to increases in anxiety at low pH. Since muscimol is known to
decrease anxiety [50], changes to the ‘normal’ function of this agonist ultimately support
Nilsson et al.’s hypothesis of reversed function of GABAA receptors in acidified
conditions.” (Lines 238 – 243)

Good, but the authors should note that further work exploring the effects of mucosimol
on crab vertical migratory behaviour might offer more insight into the ubiquity of
Nilsson et al.’s hypothesis in this species and other invertebrates (although they do
discuss the Cl- results very well, the small sample size is somewhat problematic).
The Methods section would benefit from a section describing all of the statistical analyses
d to test the various hypotheses, along with significance thresholds and software used. In the
me vein, the reporting of statistical results is currently restricted to p-values, and full statistical
ails are not reported such that the reader cannot replicate the experimental design from
tistical output and ensure that proper analyses have been conducted. At the very least, the
hors should report relevant degrees of freedom and test statistic values along with p-values
oughout the manuscript. Also in the methods, some mention of how and when the animals
re collected, fed, and housed is needed.
Response: To clarify, the revised MS includes a full explanation of all statistical analyses
at the end of the ‘2.2. Behavioural experiments’ and ‘2.3. Analysis of extracellular fluid’
subsections in the methods (lines 103 – 113 and 163 – 165, respectively) and more
complete statistical reports (e.g. degrees of freedom) in the results section, described
below. In addition, we added a new subsection to the methods section to describe animal
collection and husbandry, entitled ‘2.1. Animal collection and rearing’ (Lines 82 – 90).
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
The results are unclear and a bit confusing at points. Specific examples are highlighted below.
thors should take care to ensure that the reader can fully understand the results and
erpretation.
Response: We have added several clarifications to address your concerns below, e.g.
confusion about the difference between ambient and control seawater (xvii) and addition
of our complete statistical results (xvi). Please see our response to specific comments
below.
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
The Discussion would benefit from some recognition of the limitations of this study along
h a concluding paragraph to consolidate the results and authors’ interpretations/conclusions.
Response: The revised MS includes limitations on our interpretation of the role of
gabazine as well as field pH measurements to address this concern (see text below). In
addition, we have added a conclusion section following our results and discussion (lines
293 – 309).
“Though, we used gabazine concentrations far below known thresholds for toxicity in
another crustacean zooplankter (Daphnia) [53] and we found no difference in heart rate
or mortality after gabazine exposure, we cannot entirely eliminate the possibility that
gabazine may be acting as an olfactory toxin in these larval crabs.” (Lines 273 – 276)
“We found a similar pattern at our H. sanguineus collection site (figure 1), and the
observed pH effects to behaviour occurred over a timescale similar to these cycles. Since
our pH measurements were taken over the course of one day with fair weather, we
recognize that pH cycles may also vary over small and large spatial scales and change
with processes other than biological activity (e.g. river and groundwater input) [54].”

“After 12 h of exposure, larvae from both pH treatments were additionally exposed to the
control, kairomones, gabazine (10 µM; SR-95531; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA),
and kairomones with gabazine for 1 – 3 h before we conducted assays to determine
behavioural thresholds for each treatment. …Throughout the experiment, larvae were
maintained in their respective pH treatments, where ‘control’ signifies no addition of
kairomones or gabazine.” (Lines 137 – 142)

P4, L82: With respect to post-hoc tests: I’m not familiar with Holm-Šidák post-hoc tests, but
st post-hoc tests require a p-value correction. Were p-value corrections applied here? These
uld be necessary given the experimental design and use of post-hoc tests to determine
avioural thresholds.
Response: We agree, and the Holm-Šidák method does apply a p-value correction.
Good – though it might be worth mentioning that this method applies p-value
corrections for the reader.
P4, L87: Why only a 24 h acclimation period? Most studies rear animals in experimental
ditions for a period far longer than 24 h, as ocean acidification effects on seawater pH and
2 are likely to be long term. While the authors observed different kairomone-induced
ponses under ambient and low pH, could the short acclimation period have influenced the
azine results?
Response: We actually acclimated animals to pH treatments for just 12 h (lines 117 –
118). These short time periods were meant to reflect timescales over which estuarine and
coastal animals experience diel/tidal changes in pH. Hence, our study focused on present-
day pH fluctuations rather than global, long-term ocean acidification. After a longer
acclimatisation period, it is possible that the role of GABAergic signaling, and therefore
the effect of gabazine, might differ as the physiology of the animal as a whole has more
time to adjust (e.g. acid-base regulation). However, such a test is outside of the aim of
this study, which was in part to assess whether “decreases in pH alter the kairomone
effect to photobehaviour over a diel/tidal timescale” (lines 74 – 75). To clarify at this
point in the methods, we have added an additional sentence:
“This exposure represents the timescale over which diel/tidal pH cycles occur [27].”

scales. Estuar. Coast. 38, 220–231. (doi:10.1007/s12237-014-9800-y)
Good – but the authors should strictly mention that these tests were not meant to test
for effects of long-term ocean acidification. This should be reiterated in the discussion
surrounding the effects of long-term acidification on marine animal behaviour.
P4, L90: Why was heart rate measured? There is no indication of what this means in light of
core questions of the study.
Response: Heart rate measurements were taken to ensure that there were no apparent
differences in the animals’ health (i.e. physiological condition) after a 12 h of exposure to
pH treatments. For instance, changes to heart rate might indicate differences in condition,
metabolism, or stress. Hence, the goal of these measurements was to determine whether
animals from both treatments were in a similar condition before behavioural assays rather
than to contribute directly to the core questions of the study. The revised MS includes
further explanation concerning the purposes of these measurements:
“We randomly selected 10 individuals from each pH treatment and found no difference in
heart rate before and after pH exposure (t(7) = 0.8, P = 0.4; t-test), suggesting that there
was no apparent difference in physiological condition between pH treatments prior to
behavioural assays.” (Lines 134 – 137)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
. P5, L94: Has the pharmacology of gabazine in marine crustaceans been specifically
ablished? That is, is gabazine definitively known to target GABAA receptors in crustaceans,
could it simply act as a toxin to larval crabs (though the authors hint at toxicity in the heart
e and mortality tests reported on P5, L99-100)? Some recognition of this and justification for
ting the effect of gabazine is necessary.
Response: To our knowledge, little work has been done to determine the pharmacology
of gabazine in marine crustaceans. However, we found little reason to assume that the
chosen gabazine concentration in this study was toxic, given the results of preliminary
experiments assessing mortality and heart rate over time (referenced below).
Although Barry (2002) found evidence to suggest that gabazine only acts as a GABA
antagonist at nearly toxic concentrations in Daphnia, a freshwater crustacean, and Jackel
et al. (1994) determined that gabazine had no effect on the thoracic neurons of a marine
lobster at these low, non-toxic concentrations, several studies indicate that gabazine
functions as a competitive antagonist in other arthropods, e.g. fruitfly, Drosophila (Hosie
and Sattelle, 1996) and locust, Locusta migratoria (Janssen et al., 2010). We have added
our justification to the revised MS:
“Preliminary experiments indicated that 10-µM gabazine had no effect on heart rate or
survival (t(8) = 0.1, P = 0.9; t-test), suggesting that gabazine at this concentration was not
toxic to these crab larvae. Further, we chose to use gabazine to inhibit GABAergic
signaling in this study because gabazine has effectively reversed the effects of
acidification in both vertebrates and invertebrates, e.g. [22,25] and gabazine functions as
a competitive antagonist in other arthropods, e.g. fruitfly, Drosophila [36] and locust,
Locusta migratoria [37].” (Lines 144 – 150)

P5, L94: Were all experiments carried out in seawater with ambient pH, or was experimental
t water the same as rearing water?
Response: In the pH experiment, all animals were reared in seawater at ambient pH. As
described in our response to the above question about exposure time, 12 h prior to
behavioural assays, animals were exposed to either ambient or low pH. Animals
remained in their respective pH treatments throughout the duration of the experiment. In
the dose-response experiment, all animals were reared at ambient pH and remained in this
water during experiments. To clarify this concern in the revised MS, we have included
further explanation (see text below):
“…and all animals were reared at ambient pH (~ 8.1).” (Lines 87 – 88)

where ‘control’ signifies no addition of kairomones or gabazine.” (Lines 141 – 142)

nown to influence the biological responses to acidification. Also, what was the experimental
perature in relation to the seawater temperature where and when the animals were collected?
me explanation of animal collection and husbandry is needed.
Response: The revised MS includes a description of the temperature during animal
collection, rearing, and experiments (see text below). In addition, we have added a
section entitled ‘2.1. Animal collection and rearing’ (Lines 82 – 89) to address this
comment.
“In September of 2014 and 2015, ovigerous female Hemigrapsus sanguineus (De Haan

Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
P6, L117: Why did the authors use a different larval stage here? How might this influence the
ults and interpretation? This needs to be considered and discussed.
Response: We used a younger larval stage in the paired chloride-osmolality experiment to
increase the number of individuals per sample, and therefore extracellular fluid (ECF)
volume. Since zoea at both beginning and intermediate stages are osmoconformers over
the chosen salinity range (Anger et al., 2008), the use of younger zoea should not change
our interpretation. We have added a statement to the revised MS to address this issue:
“Contrary to the behavioural experiments, we used first-stage zoeae in this
chlorideosmolality analysis to increase the ECF sample volume, as some broods
experience high mortality over larval development (e.g. due to maternal effects) [39].
Since zoeae are osmoconformers at both beginning and intermediate stages of
development [38], the use of younger zoeae should not change our interpretation.” (Lines

Response: This has been remedied in the revised MS (line 220).
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
. P7, L157: Present full statistical analyses (df, test stats, p-values) here and throughout
nuscript.
Response: In the revised MS, we have included our full statistical analyses, as suggested.
Further, for all RM ANOVAs, the degrees of freedom are the same within each
behavioural assay (pH experiment, dose-response experiment). Hence, we include the
range of F-values with corresponding degrees of freedom as well as the range of P-values
for each of these two experiments, followed by P-values for each of the Holm-Šidák post
hoc tests. In addition, we have included the degrees of freedom and t-values for all t-tests
(e.g. Cl- analysis). Please see text below:
“For all treatments in the pH experiment, percentage descending was greater after light
stimulation than in darkness (F(6,7) = 2.6-11.2, P < 0.04; one-way RM ANOVA). Under
ambient pH conditions (~8.1), the behavioural threshold of kairomone-exposed larvae
was 1.28 × 1012 photons m-2 s -1 (P = 0.03; Holm-Šidák post hoc test), nearly two times
less than those not exposed to kairomones (2.55 × 1012 photons m-2 s -1 ; P = 0.006;
figure 2a). All those in low pH had the same threshold as the ambient control (P < 0.01;
figure 2b). Addition of gabazine with and without kairomones also resulted in the same
threshold as the control, regardless of pH (P < 0.04; figure 2c,d).” (Lines 225 – 232)
“Again, percentage descending was greater after light stimulation than in darkness
(F(5,6) = 8.0-17.8, P < 0.001, one-way RM ANOVA. Here, the behavioural threshold
was lower in larvae exposed to kairomones (P = 0.013; Holm-Šidák post hoc test) and
kairomones with gabazine at the lowest concentration (0.1 µM; P = 0.017), compared to
those exposed to the control, gabazine-only, and kairomones with gabazine at higher
concentrations (10, 1 µM; P < 0.02; table 2).” (Lines 245 – 250)
“Contrary to this hypothesis, extracellular Cl- did not vary between larvae exposed to
ambient or low pH, with mean ± se concentrations of 292 ± 63 and 282 ± 94 mM,
respectively (n = 5; t-test, t(8) = 0.08, P = 0.9).” (Lines 261 – 263)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
i. P7, L158-160: I’m unclear as to the difference between ambient pH and control seawater. Is
pH of the control seawater the same as the ambient pH? I’m assuming that it is, and I assume
t the authors mean that when pH was at ambient levels (~8.1), crabs exposed to kairomones
a lower behavioural threshold than crabs not exposed to kairomones. As written, this
tence is a bit confusing and I’d suggest re-writing it to make it clearer, if indeed my
derstanding of the sentence is correct.
ggested rewrite: “Under ambient pH conditions (~8.1), the behavioural threshold of
romone-exposed crabs was nearly two times less than crabs not exposed to kairomones.”
Response: The above assumption is correct. We have revised this sentence to clarify, as
suggested:
“Under ambient pH conditions (~8.1), the behavioural threshold of kairomone-exposed
larvae was 1.28 × 1012 photons m-2 s -1 (P = 0.03, Holm-Šidák post hoc test), nearly two
times less than those not exposed to kairomones (2.55 × 1012 photons m-2 s -1 ; P =
0.006; figure 2a).” (Lines 227 – 230)
In addition, we removed the term “control seawater” from the text entirely. Instead, we
have added a sentence to the ‘2.2.1 The pH experiment’ section of the methods to clarify:
“Throughout the experiment, larvae were maintained in their respective pH treatments,
where the ‘control’ signifies no addition of kairomones or gabazine.” (Line 141 – 142)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
ii. P8, L168: Gabazine had the same effect across treatments in which it was employed (i.e., it
tored the response observed in the ambient control). Is it possible that gabazine acted as an
actory toxin and simply knocked out olfaction in the crabs such that they could not respond to
environmental stimuli? I would think it is possible. This is important to consider, especially
en the authors’ conclusion that CO2 -induced acidification may not be acting on GABAA
ctioning (at least Cl - flux) in these crabs, but may act on kairomone chemoreception.
Response: In the revised MS, recognize this possibility (see text below).
“Though, we used gabazine concentrations far below known thresholds for toxicity in
another crustacean zooplankter (Daphnia) [53] and we found no difference in heart rate
or mortality after gabazine exposure, we cannot entirely eliminate the possibility that
gabazine may be acting as an olfactory toxin in these larval crabs.” (Lines 273 – 276)

. P9, L197: Although such diel fluctuations are not ubiquitous. From personal experience,
stal and estuarine pH cycles can vary to drastic degrees on both small and large spatial scales.
ntrasting cycles are also reported in the primary literature and can be attributed to processes
er than biological activity acting on coastal and estuarine carbonate dynamics.
hould also be noted that the diel cycles that the authors discuss are obtained from what
ears to be 4, single point pH measurements over the course of a single day. I’m assuming that
weather was generally fair during sampling and that it did not rain at any point over their
mpling period (otherwise their measurements could not speak to diel cycles). This is by no
ans intensive sampling and the degree of precision to which the authors’ measurements can
dict and describe the diel fluctuations of the area are most certainly limited. This should be
ed in the manuscript where diel pH cycles are discussed given that this was the basis for the
treatments employed.
Response: In the revised MS, we have made note of this limitation and that multiple
processes impact pH cycling in coastal habitats:
“We found a similar pattern at our H. sanguineus collection site (figure 1), and the
observed pH effects to behaviour occurred over a timescale similar to these cycles. Since
our pH measurements were taken over the course of one day with fair weather, we
recognize that pH cycles may also vary over small and large spatial scales and fluctuate
due to processes other than biological activity (e.g. river and groundwater input) [55].”

mments to the Author(s)
e manuscript by Charpentier & Cohen describes the effect of acidification and a GABA
agonist on behavior of a larval crab. The authors convincingly show a mechanism that runs
nter to the prevailing view in the literature, and therefore the results would be useful and of
rest to the ocean acidification and larval behavior communities. Overall, the manuscript is
entifically sound (see specific comments below) and the authors do not over -interpret their
ults. The manuscript is generally well-written, although there are a few areas that could use
rification, as described below.
40 – “outpouring of literature” – it would be helpful to provide more detail here. Besides reef
, in what other animals has this been assessed and what were the results of those studies?
Response: We have added several examples to provide further detail on the range of
affected sensory and behavioural processes and the variety of animals in which these
effects have been observed. “To name a few, these low pH conditions can inhibit or alter
olfaction [3,4,5,6], vision [7], auditory function [8], lateralization [9,10], anti-predator
behaviour [11,12], visual risk assessment [13], foraging behaviour [14,15,16], shell
assessment/homing or settlement ability [17,18,19], and learning [20] in marine fish,
crustaceans, and mollusks from both tropical and temperate environments.” (Lines 41 –
45)
Good. The additional information and references to specific studies addresses this
comment well. However, in the first sentence, the authors may want to recognize that
the decrease in oceanic pH is due to an increase in oceanic CO2 and subsequent
alterations in the marine carbonate system. In addition, the bulk of behavioural
changes are thought to be the result of elevated CO2 and not necessarily a drop in pH.
Some mention of this would enhance clarification in the paper’s opening.
Response: We have made several changes to address the above comment. First, we have
added further detail to the first sentence of the introduction: “…as a result of elevated
oceanic CO2 and subsequent changes to the marine carbonate system.” (Lines 40 – 41)
In addition, we have clarified that elevated CO2 is thought to be the cause of these
behavioural changes in the introduction, “these elevated CO2 conditions can inhibit or
alter…” (line 43), and in the discussion (see below).
“Past studies attribute similar changes in behaviour and sensation to increases in
CO2, reviewed in [2].” (Lines __-__)
Lastly, we restated the direct association between pH and CO2 when explaining the
objectives of our study at the conclusion of the introduction, “(1) if decreases in pH (i.e.
increases in pCO2) alter…” (lines 76 – 77).
69-70. The three questions the authors propose are intuitive, but reading further into the
thods, it’s not entirely clear what methods go with what question. I had to re-read the methods
rder to break apart which methods went with which questions. It may be helpful to either
e how each question was assessed at the conclusion of the intro, or separate the methods text
h headings that correspond directly to the 3 questions asked.
Response: As suggested, we now describe how each question was assessed at the
conclusion of the introduction:
“With larval H. sanguineus, we assessed (1) if decreases in pH alter the kairomone effect
to photobehaviour over a diel/tidal timescale using a behavioural assay with two pH
treatments, (2) whether GABAergic signalling plays a role in the kairomone effect with a
second assay assessing the dose-response relationship of gabazine to photobehaviour, and
(3) if our results support Nilsson et al.’s GABA hypothesis with the above behavioural
assays and a comparison of extracellular Cl- concentrations.” (Lines 74 – 79)
To further clarify, we have also split up the behavioural experiments section of the
methods into two subsections, entitled, ‘2.2.1 The pH experiment’ (lines 114 – 150) and
‘2.2.2. The gabazine dose-response experiment’ (lines 151 – 156).
Good. This comment has been well addressed.
86. Based on Fig. 1, the high pH appears to be ~7.8. If this is the point of comparison in
ms of diel fluctuations, why was 8.1 used as the “ambient” level?
Response: Hemigrapsus sanguineus undergo offshore transport during larval
development, and zoeae of all stages have been found on the continental shelf offshore of
Delaware and Maryland (Epifanio et al. 2013). In September 2014, when larval H.
sanguineus would have been abundant (Epifanio et al. 2013), daytime pH ranged from
7.9 to 8.1 on the continental shelf of the mid Atlantic (New Jersey, Delaware, and
Maryland; Barbero et al., 2016). In addition, much of the previous work testing
behavioural changes in animals exposed to acidified seawater used an ambient or control
pH of 8.0-8.2, including tropical and temperate fish, crustaceans, and mollusks (e.g.
Bibby et al. 2007; de la Haye et al. 2012; Dixson et al. 2010; Hamilton et al. 2014;
Watson et al. 2014). Hence, our chosen “ambient” treatment reflects relevant pH values
for larval H. sanguineus habitat, and can be easily compared to previous work that
assesses similar pH-mediated changes to behaviour. Further, we chose 7.6 for our low pH
treatment, because nighttime values of pH may be as low as 7.7 on the shelf (Barbero et
al., 2016) and 7.5 at our collection site (Fig. 1). The manuscript now includes text that
outlines how we selected our pH treatments, including relevant references:
“To choose an appropriate pH range, we measured pH at the site of H. sanguineus
collection, Roosevelt Inlet, Lewes, DE, and reviewed open access pH data from a
relevant offshore environment…” (Lines 120 – 122) “…Our ambient treatment reflects
daytime pH values found on the continental shelf of the mid-Atlantic (7.9-8.1) [33],
where H. sanguineus spend much of their larval development [34]. We chose a low pH of
7.6 to exemplify the minimum pH these animals may experience during embryonic
development, transport, and diel changes in pH in this coastal environment (figure 1;
[33]).” (Lines 128 – 133)

Justification for pH treatments is now addressed, but it is now unclear as to how these
chosen pH levels correspond to future ocean acidification. A short sentence to indicate
that one might expect H. sanguineus to experience pH conditions at or below the
current minimum under future ocean acidification is warranted here.
Response: In the revised MS, we added a sentence to clarify that our exposures represent
a present-day scenario, and H. sanguineus may experience even greater acidification in
the future:
“We chose a low pH of 7.6 to exemplify the minimum pH these animals may
experience during embryonic development, transport, and diel changes in pH in
this coastal environment at present day (figure 1; [33]). However, H. sanguineus
may be exposed to pH conditions below the current minimum under future ocean
acidification [1].” (Lines 136 – 139)
86. Why are the containers sealed?
Response: During the time of exposure to each pH treatment, containers were sealed to
reduce exchange of gas or dust particles with the surrounding environment. We have
included this description in the revised MS to clarify: “These containers were sealed to
reduce exchange of gas or dust particles with the surrounding environment.” (Lines 119 –
120)
Good. A statement to reassure the reader that other abiotic conditions (e.g. oxygen,
temperature, and salinity) did not change over the course of the experiment would be
good to add here (assuming that they didn’t…). If some conditions weren’t measured,
it might be good to find literature using closed containers in similar experiments to
ensure that other confounding variables could not have impacted the results.
In the revised MS, we include details about abiotic factors (temperature, salinity, and
oxygen):
“Temperature and salinity did not change during this exposure time. Though
oxygen was not measured, potential changes to dissolved oxygen would have
been minimal (see details in electronic supplementary material).” (Lines 123 –
125)
Further, in the revised supplementary material, we discuss a simple calculation that
indicates minimal changes to dissolved oxygen during pH exposure in our sealed
containers (see explanation under ‘2.2.1. The pH experiment’).
87. Provide details on how and how often pH was measured at the field site. Was this NBS
le? If so how closely do these correspond to the reported pHT values?
Response: In the revised manuscript, we provide details on the procedure used to obtain
the pH measurements shown in Figure 1 (see text below). We deployed a YSI Sonde with
fast-response pH sensor to measure pH, which uses an NBS scale. When comparing pH
values used in our behavioural experiments, the mean standard deviation between values
measured on an NBS scale and calculated pHT values was 0.06 in the ambient pH
treatment and 0.09 in the low pH treatment. Further, if we assume that pHT is closest to
the actual pH value, this translates into a mean percent error of < 2% in both treatments.
Admittedly, it is not ideal to include pH values of two different scales. The revised MS
summarizes the above error analysis to provide the reader with an accurate sense of this
caveat.
“Further, on July 9th, 2015, we measured pH in Roosevelt Inlet, Lewes, DE at four time
points throughout the day (6600-V2 sonde with 6589 Fast-Response pH sensor; YSI
Incorporated, Yellow Springs, OH, USA) (figure 1). This potentiometric electrode
measures pH on the NBS scale. We recognize that this method is not ideal for
measurement of seawater pH [31,32]. However, when comparing pH values during our
behavioural experiment, the percent error between pH measured on the NBS scale and
the total pH scale (pHT; described in further detail below) was < 2%.” (Lines 122 – 128)

92. I’m confused on the seawater conditions for the actual behavioral assays. Were the
ays actually carried out at both pH levels or were the larvae just pre-exposed to the 2 levels of
and then assays were conducted at ambient pH? If the latter, this seems like it would affect
r overall conclusions.
Response: During behavioural assays, larvae were maintained in the seawater from their
respective pH treatments. To add clarity to this confusion, the revised MS includes the
below text:
“Throughout the experiment, larvae were maintained in their respective pH treatments,
where the “control” signifies no addition of kairomones or gabazine.” (Lines 141 – 142)
od – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
93 – “= 1 h” – this seems vague. Was there a specific time? It seems as though time would
ect behavioral responses.
Response: Prior to behavioural experiments, animals were exposed to kairomone and
gabazine treatments for 1 – 3 h, exposure durations which we have shown previously to
result in an equivalent kairomone effect. We have clarified this in the text. (Lines 139,
155)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
94 – “Here, we used artificial seawater”. The context is a bit confusing here. Was artificial
water used for all experiments or only certain experiments? In these assays, did you adjust
alinity of instant ocean to bring it closer to what might be expected in natural seawater?
Response: In the original MS, we were trying to highlight that two types of seawater were
used, artificial seawater in the pH experiment and filtered/aged seawater in the dose-
response experiment. In the revised MS, we have removed the sentence referenced above
and added a separate paragraph in section ‘2.4. Seawater chemistry’ of the methods,
dedicated to clarifying this point.
“In all experiments, we controlled for…” (Lines 185 – 192)
Also, we did not adjust the alkalinity of instant ocean to match expected values in natural
seawater. Since alkalinity is generally conservative and namely changes with salinity, we
assumed that matching the salinities of the ambient and low pH treatment would result in
similar TA values. Please see our response to the comment about Table 1 below for
further explanation.
Okay. Although pretty unlikely, it could be possible that the different seawater
conditions resulted in different dose-dependent responses between the pH experiment
and the dose-dependent experiment such that gabazine was toxic in one but not the
other. A mention of this in the discussion surrounding gabazine toxicity is warranted.
Response: In the revised MS, we describe the potential for gabazine toxicity in H.
sanguineus and how the effect and/or toxicity of gabazine may have varied between our
two seawater types:
“Though, we used gabazine concentrations far below known thresholds for
toxicity in another crustacean zooplankter (Daphnia) [55] and we found no
difference in heart rate or mortality after gabazine exposure, we cannot entirely
eliminate the possibility that gabazine may be acting as an olfactory toxin in these
larval crabs. In addition, we recognize the possibility that the effect or even
toxicity of gabazine may have varied between seawater types in the pH and dose-
response experiment (artificial and filtered seawater, respectively). However, this
is unlikely, as we observed similar responses to gabazine (10 µM) at ambient pH
in both.” (Lines 285 – 292)
130 – Was the ambient pH level adjusted with the pHstat system as well?
Response: Due to constraints of laboratory space and sampling time, we were not able to
adjust the ambient pH with the pH/CO2 stat system. Rather, we used the same salinity
and Instant Ocean artificial seawater mix to obtain carbonate parameters as similar as
possible. This clarification has been added to the revised MS: “Due to spatial and
temporal constraints, the ambient pH was not regulated with the described pH/CO2 stat
system. However, we used the same salinity and artificial seawater mix in both to obtain
similar carbonate parameters.” (Lines 197 – 200)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
155 – It may be helpful early in the results/discussion section to restate what is meant by
avioral threshold and how this was defined. I had to go back and re-read the methods to make
se of this.
Response: We agree, and the results and discussion section now opens with:
“We assessed the effect of pH and the role of GABAergic signalling in kairomone-
induced changes to photobehaviour by comparing the behavioural threshold, i.e. the
lowest light intensity to elicit a descent response, between pH and kairomone/gabazine
treatments.” (Lines 223 – 225)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
179 – “another crustacean” – which one? The study referenced here examined the role of
BAergic signaling in olfaction of the spiny lobster.
Response: The revised MS now states: “In the spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, opening of
GABAA receptors…” (Lines 255 – 257)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
188 – “appeared higher” – was this significant?
Response: The sample size in our paired osmolality-chloride experiment was too low (n =
2) for robust statistical analysis. We clarify this point in the revised MS: “Though our
small sample size (n = 2) inhibited robust statistical analysis, osmolality appeared higher
at low pH (table 3), suggesting an increase of other osmolytes, which could include
HCO3-.” (Lines 265 – 267)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
le 1 – TA is substantially lower at low pH. Could you propose a mechanism for this?
pically in OA studies, TA remains fairly constant regardless of pH.
Response: In the revised MS, we have added a section to propose a mechanism for the
observed differences in TA in the supplementary materials, entitled ‘2.4. Seawater
chemistry’. This addition is referenced in the main document: “Though values of TA are
higher than would be expected at a salinity of 32 in the ambient pH treatment (table 1),
our pH calculations and results should not be affected by this difference (details in
electronic supplementary material).” (Lines 217 – 220)
Good - comment has been addressed sufficiently. However, it should be noted
somewhere in the discussion that the authors cannot isolate the particular carbonate
geochemical parameter driving the results. It might be pH, could be CO2, and might be
TA (given the stark differences in TA between treatments). A paragraph discussing
how elevated CO2 and associated carbonate parameters impact marine animal
behaviour is warranted in the discussion, along with a mention of treatment-specific
differences in carbonate geochemistry observed in this study. At current, the authors
attribute all effects to pH, but that may not necessarily be the case.
Response: In the revised MS, we include explanation in the discussion to address the
above concern:
“Hence, exposure to acidified seawater removed kairomone-induced
photosensitivity in H. sanguineus. Past studies attribute similar changes in
behaviour and sensation to increases in CO2, reviewed in [2]. Given differences in
carbonate chemistry between our pH treatments (table 1), we cannot isolate which
particular carbonate parameter(s) may be driving these changes.” (Lines 239 –
242)

s manuscript reports on the results of a laboratory study testing for effects of decreased pH
0.5) and gabazine on the ability of crab larvae to detect predator chemical cues (fish
romones) and ultimately initiate a vertical migration to deeper waters. The authors report that
b larvae respond to kairomones by initiating a vertical descent at lower light intensities
ehavioural threshold”; ~2x lower) than larvae not exposed to kairomones under ambient
.1) pH conditions. Exposure to gabazine negated this kairomone response, as the behavioural
eshold with and without kairomones in gabazine-treated crabs was similar to that of control
ditions. The authors also suggest that acidification reduced the kairomone-induced changes in
behavioural threshold, although I cannot see from the statistical analysis and reporting of the
ults where this interpretation comes from (see specific comments).
e manuscript contributes novel information and is quite unique, is fairly well written (with the
eption of some parts of the results that are difficult to follow), and the statistical analyses, for
most part, appear reasonable. I also commend the authors for the addition of measurements
t aid in understanding biological responses to CO2-induced acidification, including the
ailed measurements of Cl- fluxes under different pH conditions. I do have some concerns
ut aspects of the methodology (use of gabazine) that may have influenced the results and
rpretation in the context of ocean acidification that need to be addressed. Furthermore, I think
t some parts of the manuscript could benefit from increasing clarity and expanding the level
detail provided, given that the manuscript is no longer under the length restrictions of Biology
ters (as per authors’ cover letter). As such, I recommend that the manuscript be accepted after
orough revision. I have provided some general and specific comments below that should aid
evising the manuscript.
neral comments:
he introduction is very well written and provides a high level of detail. However, the authors
to introduce (or discuss) results similar to their own which have been reported previously.
milton et al. (2014) found similar effects of gabazine in rockfish, where gabazine treated fish
ibited anxiety responses consistent with those observed under elevated CO2 (also in contrast
he Nilsson et al. hypothesis). This study should be considered in the introduction, discussion,
interpretation of the results.
Response: In the revised MS, we have included the findings of Hamilton et al. (2014) in
the introduction and further assessed their relativity to our study in the results and
discussion section (see text below).
Introduction “…though gabazine did not reverse increases in anxiety after exposure to
acidified seawater in a juvenile rockfish [26].” (Lines 58 – 59)
Discussion “Hamilton et al. [26] similarly found that gabazine did not reverse increases
in anxiety after exposure to acidified seawater in a juvenile fish. However, a GABA
agonist, muscimol, added to increases in anxiety at low pH. Since muscimol is known to
decrease anxiety [50], changes to the ‘normal’ function of this agonist ultimately support
Nilsson et al.’s hypothesis of reversed function of GABAA receptors in acidified
conditions.” (Lines 238 – 243)

Good, but the authors should note that further work exploring the effects of mucosimol
on crab vertical migratory behaviour might offer more insight into the ubiquity of
Nilsson et al.’s hypothesis in this species and other invertebrates (although they do
discuss the Cl- results very well, the small sample size is somewhat problematic).
We have added a comment to address the importance of assessing muscimol in the future:
“Naturally, further work examining the effects of muscimol on behaviour would
offer greater certainty in confirming or contradicting Nilsson et al.’s hypothesis.”
(Lines 252 – 254)
he Methods section would benefit from a section describing all of the statistical analyses
d to test the various hypotheses, along with significance thresholds and software used. In the
e vein, the reporting of statistical results is currently restricted to p-values, and full statistical
ails are not reported such that the reader cannot replicate the experimental design from
istical output and ensure that proper analyses have been conducted. At the very least, the
hors should report relevant degrees of freedom and test statistic values along with p-values
oughout the manuscript. Also in the methods, some mention of how and when the animals
re collected, fed, and housed is needed.
Response: To clarify, the revised MS includes a full explanation of all statistical analyses
at the end of the ‘2.2. Behavioural experiments’ and ‘2.3. Analysis of extracellular fluid’
subsections in the methods (lines 103 – 113 and 163 – 165, respectively) and more
complete statistical reports (e.g. degrees of freedom) in the results section, described
below. In addition, we added a new subsection to the methods section to describe animal
collection and husbandry, entitled ‘2.1. Animal collection and rearing’ (Lines 82 – 90).
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
he results are unclear and a bit confusing at points. Specific examples are highlighted below.
thors should take care to ensure that the reader can fully understand the results and
rpretation.
Response: We have added several clarifications to address your concerns below, e.g.
confusion about the difference between ambient and control seawater (xvii) and addition
of our complete statistical results (xvi). Please see our response to specific comments
below.
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
he Discussion would benefit from some recognition of the limitations of this study along
h a concluding paragraph to consolidate the results and authors’ interpretations/conclusions.
Response: The revised MS includes limitations on our interpretation of the role of
gabazine as well as field pH measurements to address this concern (see text below). In
addition, we have added a conclusion section following our results and discussion (lines
293 – 309).
“Though, we used gabazine concentrations far below known thresholds for toxicity in
another crustacean zooplankter (Daphnia) [53] and we found no difference in heart rate
or mortality after gabazine exposure, we cannot entirely eliminate the possibility that
gabazine may be acting as an olfactory toxin in these larval crabs.” (Lines 273 – 276)
“We found a similar pattern at our H. sanguineus collection site (figure 1), and the
observed pH effects to behaviour occurred over a timescale similar to these cycles. Since
our pH measurements were taken over the course of one day with fair weather, we
recognize that pH cycles may also vary over small and large spatial scales and change
with processes other than biological activity (e.g. river and groundwater input) [54].”

thods
P4, L77: How long were crabs acclimated in the dark for? What were the seawater chemical
ditions during this acclimation period?
Response: The revised MS includes clarification for both of these questions:
“Animals were dark-acclimated within their respective treatments for 1 – 3 h.” (Line 95)
“After 12 h of exposure, larvae from both pH treatments were additionally exposed to the
control, kairomones, gabazine (10 µM; SR-95531; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA),
and kairomones with gabazine for 1 – 3 h before we conducted assays to determine
behavioural thresholds for each treatment. …Throughout the experiment, larvae were
maintained in their respective pH treatments, where ‘control’ signifies no addition of
kairomones or gabazine.” (Lines 137 – 142)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
4, L82: With respect to post-hoc tests: I’m not familiar with Holm-Šidák post-hoc tests, but
st post-hoc tests require a p-value correction. Were p-value corrections applied here? These
uld be necessary given the experimental design and use of post-hoc tests to determine
avioural thresholds.
Response: We agree, and the Holm-Šidák method does apply a p-value correction.
Good – though it might be worth mentioning that this method applies p-value
corrections for the reader.
Response: In the revised MS, we indicate that the Holm-Šidák method performs the
appropriate p-value correction:
“…Holm-Šidák post hoc tests were used to determine which specific light stimuli
evoked a significant descent response, compared to swimming behaviour in the
dark (P < 0.05; P-values corrected for multiple comparisons).” (Lines 109 – 111)
P4, L87: Why only a 24 h acclimation period? Most studies rear animals in experimental
ditions for a period far longer than 24 h, as ocean acidification effects on seawater pH and
2 are likely to be long term. While the authors observed different kairomone-induced
ponses under ambient and low pH, could the short acclimation period have influenced the
azine results?
Response: We actually acclimated animals to pH treatments for just 12 h (lines 117 –
118). These short time periods were meant to reflect timescales over which estuarine and
coastal animals experience diel/tidal changes in pH. Hence, our study focused on present-
day pH fluctuations rather than global, long-term ocean acidification. After a longer
acclimatisation period, it is possible that the role of GABAergic signaling, and therefore
the effect of gabazine, might differ as the physiology of the animal as a whole has more
time to adjust (e.g. acid-base regulation). However, such a test is outside of the aim of
this study, which was in part to assess whether “decreases in pH alter the kairomone
effect to photobehaviour over a diel/tidal timescale” (lines 74 – 75). To clarify at this
point in the methods, we have added an additional sentence:
“This exposure represents the timescale over which diel/tidal pH cycles occur [27].”
(Lines 118 – 119)

O2 fluctuations in a temperate tidal salt marsh on diel, seasonal, and interannual time
scales. Estuar. Coast. 38, 220–231. (doi:10.1007/s12237-014-9800-y)
Good – but the authors should strictly mention that these tests were not meant to test
for effects of long-term ocean acidification. This should be reiterated in the discussion
surrounding the effects of long-term acidification on marine animal behaviour.
In the revised MS, we reiterate that our pH exposures where chosen to represent present-
day conditions in the methods and the results/discussion sections.
“We chose a low pH of 7.6 to exemplify the minimum pH these animals may
experience during embryonic development, transport, and diel changes in pH in
this coastal environment at present day (figure 1; [33]). However, H. sanguineus
may be exposed to pH conditions below the current minimum under future ocean
acidification [1].” (Lines 136 – 139)
“To date, most studies assess the effects of CO2 and/or pH on behaviour in the
context of future global ocean acidification [2]. However, in estuarine and coastal
habitats, present-day pH fluctuations are influenced by biological activity, where
pH generally decreases at night and increases during the day [54]. We found a
similar pattern at our H. sanguineus collection site (figure 1), and the observed pH
effects to behaviour occurred over a timescale similar to these cycles.” (Lines 293
– 298)
P4, L90: Why was heart rate measured? There is no indication of what this means in light of
core questions of the study.
Response: Heart rate measurements were taken to ensure that there were no apparent
differences in the animals’ health (i.e. physiological condition) after a 12 h of exposure to
pH treatments. For instance, changes to heart rate might indicate differences in condition,
metabolism, or stress. Hence, the goal of these measurements was to determine whether
animals from both treatments were in a similar condition before behavioural assays rather
than to contribute directly to the core questions of the study. The revised MS includes
further explanation concerning the purposes of these measurements:
“We randomly selected 10 individuals from each pH treatment and found no difference in
heart rate before and after pH exposure (t(7) = 0.8, P = 0.4; t-test), suggesting that there
was no apparent difference in physiological condition between pH treatments prior to
behavioural assays.” (Lines 134 – 137)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
. P5, L94: Has the pharmacology of gabazine in marine crustaceans been specifically
ablished? That is, is gabazine definitively known to target GABAA receptors in crustaceans,
ould it simply act as a toxin to larval crabs (though the authors hint at toxicity in the heart
and mortality tests reported on P5, L99-100)? Some recognition of this and justification for
ing the effect of gabazine is necessary.
Response: To our knowledge, little work has been done to determine the pharmacology of
gabazine in marine crustaceans. However, we found little reason to assume that the
chosen gabazine concentration in this study was toxic, given the results of preliminary
experiments assessing mortality and heart rate over time (referenced below).
Although Barry (2002) found evidence to suggest that gabazine only acts as a GABA
antagonist at nearly toxic concentrations in Daphnia, a freshwater crustacean, and Jackel
et al. (1994) determined that gabazine had no effect on the thoracic neurons of a marine
lobster at these low, non-toxic concentrations, several studies indicate that gabazine
functions as a competitive antagonist in other arthropods, e.g. fruitfly, Drosophila (Hosie
and Sattelle, 1996) and locust, Locusta migratoria (Janssen et al., 2010). We have added
our justification to the revised MS:
“Preliminary experiments indicated that 10-µM gabazine had no effect on heart rate or
survival (t(8) = 0.1, P = 0.9; t-test), suggesting that gabazine at this concentration was not
toxic to these crab larvae. Further, we chose to use gabazine to inhibit GABAergic
signaling in this study because gabazine has effectively reversed the effects of
acidification in both vertebrates and invertebrates, e.g. [22,25] and gabazine functions as
a competitive antagonist in other arthropods, e.g. fruitfly, Drosophila [36] and locust,
Locusta migratoria [37].” (Lines 144 – 150)

The literature on hydrozoans is certainly interesting. In the revised MS, we
reference the two suggested publications:
“…gabazine functions as a competitive antagonist in other arthropods, e.g.
fruitfly, Drosophila [36] and locust, Locusta migratoria [37] and in an
aquatic invertebrate, Hydra vulgaris [38,39].” (Lines 156 – 158)
P5, L94: Were all experiments carried out in seawater with ambient pH, or was experimental
water the same as rearing water?
Response: In the pH experiment, all animals were reared in seawater at ambient pH. As
described in our response to the above question about exposure time, 12 h prior to
behavioural assays, animals were exposed to either ambient or low pH. Animals
remained in their respective pH treatments throughout the duration of the experiment. In
the dose-response experiment, all animals were reared at ambient pH and remained in this
water during experiments. To clarify this concern in the revised MS, we have included
further explanation (see text below):
“…and all animals were reared at ambient pH (~ 8.1).” (Lines 87 – 88)
“Throughout the experiment, larvae were maintained in their respective pH treatments,
where ‘control’ signifies no addition of kairomones or gabazine.” (Lines 141 – 142)

5, L95-96: The seawater temperature of the experiments needs to be reported, as temperature
nown to influence the biological responses to acidification. Also, what was the experimental
perature in relation to the seawater temperature where and when the animals were collected?
me explanation of animal collection and husbandry is needed.
Response: The revised MS includes a description of the temperature during animal
collection, rearing, and experiments (see text below). In addition, we have added a
section entitled ‘2.1. Animal collection and rearing’ (Lines 82 – 89) to address this
comment.
“In September of 2014 and 2015, ovigerous female Hemigrapsus sanguineus (De Haan
1853) were collected from Roosevelt Inlet, DE, USA. Water temperature ranged from 18
– 23 °C during this time. We kept these females in the laboratory under a 14 h:10 h
light:dark cycle at ~ 22 °C in seawater at a salinity of 32 practical salinity units (psu).”
(Lines 83 – 86)
“All experiments were conducted at the same temperature in which animals were reared
(22 °C).” (Lines 97 – 98)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
P6, L117: Why did the authors use a different larval stage here? How might this influence the
ults and interpretation? This needs to be considered and discussed.
Response: We used a younger larval stage in the paired chloride-osmolality experiment to
increase the number of individuals per sample, and therefore extracellular fluid (ECF)
volume. Since zoea at both beginning and intermediate stages are osmoconformers over
the chosen salinity range (Anger et al., 2008), the use of younger zoea should not change
our interpretation. We have added a statement to the revised MS to address this issue:
“Contrary to the behavioural experiments, we used first-stage zoeae in this chloride-
osmolality analysis to increase the ECF sample volume, as some broods experience high
mortality over larval development (e.g. due to maternal effects) [39]. Since zoeae are
osmoconformers at both beginning and intermediate stages of development [38], the use
of younger zoeae should not change our interpretation.” (Lines 179 – 183)

. P6, L136: Why did you use both NBS and IUPAC scales rather than just one?
Response: This pH scale is only referred to as “NBS” in the revised MS.
Okay – good.
. P7, L153: A section outlining the statistical analyses employed is needed.
Response: The revised MS includes two additional paragraphs in the methods to
articulate all statistical analyses: (1) at the conclusion of ‘2.2. Behavioural experiments’
subsection (lines 103 – 113) and (2) within the ‘2.3. Analysis of extracellular fluid’ (lines
163 – 165).

ults and Discussion
P7, L152: Missing period.
Response: This has been remedied in the revised MS (line 220).
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
. P7, L157: Present full statistical analyses (df, test stats, p-values) here and throughout
nuscript.
Response: In the revised MS, we have included our full statistical analyses, as suggested.
Further, for all RM ANOVAs, the degrees of freedom are the same within each
behavioural assay (pH experiment, dose-response experiment). Hence, we include the
range of F-values with corresponding degrees of freedom as well as the range of P-values
for each of these two experiments, followed by P-values for each of the Holm-Šidák post
hoc tests. In addition, we have included the degrees of freedom and t-values for all t-tests
(e.g. Cl- analysis). Please see text below:
“For all treatments in the pH experiment, percentage descending was greater after light
stimulation than in darkness (F(6,7) = 2.6-11.2, P < 0.04; one-way RM ANOVA). Under
ambient pH conditions (~8.1), the behavioural threshold of kairomone-exposed larvae
was 1.28 × 1012 photons m-2 s-1 (P = 0.03; Holm-Šidák post hoc test), nearly two times
less than those not exposed to kairomones (2.55 Å~ 1012 photons m-2 s -1 ; P = 0.006;
figure 2a). All those in low pH had the same threshold as the ambient control (P < 0.01;
figure 2b). Addition of gabazine with and without kairomones also resulted in the same
threshold as the control, regardless of pH (P < 0.04; figure 2c,d).” (Lines 225 – 232)
“Again, percentage descending was greater after light stimulation than in darkness
(F(5,6) = 8.0-17.8, P < 0.001, one-way RM ANOVA. Here, the behavioural threshold
was lower in larvae exposed to kairomones (P = 0.013; Holm-Šidák post hoc test) and
kairomones with gabazine at the lowest concentration (0.1 µM; P = 0.017), compared to
those exposed to the control, gabazine-only, and kairomones with gabazine at higher
concentrations (10, 1 µM; P < 0.02; table 2).” (Lines 245 – 250)
“Contrary to this hypothesis, extracellular Cl- did not vary between larvae exposed to
ambient or low pH, with mean ± se concentrations of 292 ± 63 and 282 ± 94 mM,
respectively (n = 5; t-test, t(8) = 0.08, P = 0.9).” (Lines 261 – 263)

i. P7, L158-160: I’m unclear as to the difference between ambient pH and control seawater. Is
pH of the control seawater the same as the ambient pH? I’m assuming that it is, and I assume
t the authors mean that when pH was at ambient levels (~8.1), crabs exposed to kairomones
a lower behavioural threshold than crabs not exposed to kairomones. As written, this
tence is a bit confusing and I’d suggest re-writing it to make it clearer, if indeed my
erstanding of the sentence is correct.
gested rewrite: “Under ambient pH conditions (~8.1), the behavioural threshold of
romone-exposed crabs was nearly two times less than crabs not exposed to kairomones.”
Response: The above assumption is correct. We have revised this sentence to clarify, as
suggested:
“Under ambient pH conditions (~8.1), the behavioural threshold of kairomone-exposed
larvae was 1.28 Å~ 1012 photons m-2 s -1 (P = 0.03, Holm-Šidák post hoc test), nearly
two times less than those not exposed to kairomones (2.55 Å~ 1012 photons m-2 s -1 ; P
= 0.006; figure 2a).” (Lines 227 – 230)
In addition, we removed the term “control seawater” from the text entirely. Instead, we
have added a sentence to the ‘2.2.1 The pH experiment’ section of the methods to clarify:
“Throughout the experiment, larvae were maintained in their respective pH treatments,
where the ‘control’ signifies no addition of kairomones or gabazine.” (Line 141 – 142)
Good – comment has been addressed sufficiently.
ii. P8, L168: Gabazine had the same effect across treatments in which it was employed (i.e., it
ored the response observed in the ambient control). Is it possible that gabazine acted as an
actory toxin and simply knocked out olfaction in the crabs such that they could not respond to
environmental stimuli? I would think it is possible. This is important to consider, especially
en the authors’ conclusion that CO2-induced acidification may not be acting on GABAA
ctioning (at least Cl- flux) in these crabs, but may act on kairomone chemoreception.
Response: In the revised MS, recognize this possibility (see text below).
“Though, we used gabazine concentrations far below known thresholds for toxicity in
another crustacean zooplankter (Daphnia) [53] and we found no difference in heart rate
or mortality after gabazine exposure, we cannot entirely eliminate the possibility that
gabazine may be acting as an olfactory toxin in these larval crabs.” (Lines 273 – 276)

. P9, L197: Although such diel fluctuations are not ubiquitous. From personal experience,
stal and estuarine pH cycles can vary to drastic degrees on both small and large spatial scales.
ntrasting cycles are also reported in the primary literature and can be attributed to processes
er than biological activity acting on coastal and estuarine carbonate dynamics.
hould also be noted that the diel cycles that the authors discuss are obtained from what
ears to be 4, single point pH measurements over the course of a single day. I’m assuming that
weather was generally fair during sampling and that it did not rain at any point over their
pling period (otherwise their measurements could not speak to diel cycles). This is by no
ans intensive sampling and the degree of precision to which the authors’ measurements can
dict and describe the diel fluctuations of the area are most certainly limited. This should be
ed in the manuscript where diel pH cycles are discussed given that this was the basis for the
treatments employed.
Response: In the revised MS, we have made note of this limitation and that multiple
processes impact pH cycling in coastal habitats:
“We found a similar pattern at our H. sanguineus collection site (figure 1), and the
observed pH effects to behaviour occurred over a timescale similar to these cycles. Since
our pH measurements were taken over the course of one day with fair weather, we
recognize that pH cycles may also vary over small and large spatial scales and fluctuate
due to processes other than biological activity (e.g. river and groundwater input) [55].”
