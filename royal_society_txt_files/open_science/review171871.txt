The present is an interesting manuscript studying the value of three SNP as markers for diabetic
nephropathy development.
But in my opinion there are various concerns:
MAJOR concerns:
- The number of patients (subjects) is not enough to establish the conclusions in such a genetic
srudy.
- The authors do not explain why they choosed these three SNP and no other ones.
- In the sequencing verification they took a 10% of the subjects to verify the accuracy of
genotyping I am not convince that this fact should be good enough to this verification
- With regards to the results, the authors affirm that the weight of the subjects was not different at
baseline in both groups, - studied and control group-, bur the BMI was a independent risk factor
for the development of DN in the patients having the 3 SNP. This fact may be conveniently
explained.
MINOR concerns:
Introduction.
-Today the concept of Diabetic Nephropalthy perhaps may be changed to that of "Diabetic
Kidney Disease" (DKD).
- The incidence of DKD in type 2 DM patients may be estimated in a range between 30 to 40%, an
not exactly in 40%, taking into account the data in the Literature.
- RESULTS. tHe references to a non signifficant value for p may be expressed as P= n.s., and not
p> 0.05 in all the results along the text.
- The concepts of TC, HDL-c, LDL-c, BMI and PCR-RFLP may be define previously before the
initials.
- The value of these three SNP may be apliccable to the patients with albuminuria, but can not be
applied to the patients with DKD not developping proteinuria, a form of DKD increasingly
present in our patients. Some comment on that may be added.
- The discussion is not really a deep discussion, without a reference to the weaknesses and
strengths of the findings.
- The conclusions are very poor, in order to the appliccability of this research to the daily clinics.
- Finally, a footnote with the explaination of the initials may be added to all the tables.

This manuscript is well written and addresses a good topic. However, some revisions are
required to substantially improve the manuscript and render it suitable for publication.
1) The Introduction would benefit from the review article on the field. Such example include:
Gheith O, Farouk N, Nampoory N, Halim MA, Al-Otaibi T. Diabetic kidney disease: worldwide
difference of prevalence and risk factors. J Nephropharmacol. 2016; 5(1)49-56.
2) What was the refusal rate for participation in the study among cases and among controls? This
should be added in the respective section.
3) Additional information is necessary regarding the definition of DN patients.Specifically, were
the patients consecutive? Were there any exclusion criteria?
4) Kindly state, how to calculate sample size.
5) Kindly write correct frequency of GA genotype of rs10823108 polymorphism in Table 2.
6) The Table3 in their current form present only unadjusted ORs; adjustment for age, gender,
family history, smoking, blood pressure, HbA1C,TC, TG, HDL, LDL and BMI (all are available to
the researchers) should also be performed. The adjusted ORs and 95%Cls should be presented in
Table 3 in an additional column next to the unadjusted ORs.

Appendix A
Dear editor,
Manuscript: RSOS-171871
Thank the reviewers’ helpful comments and suggestions. Those comments are very
helpful to improve our manuscript. Based on the comments, we have revised the
manuscript accordingly. A list of changes is as below.
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The present is an interesting manuscript studying the value of three SNP as markers
for diabetic nephropathy development.
But in my opinion there are various concerns:
MAJOR concerns:
- The number of patients (subjects) is not enough to establish the conclusions in such
a genetic srudy.
Answer: The current data is selected from patients admitted to our hospital. And the
scope of this study will be expanded and a further experimentation will be conducted
later.
- The authors do not explain why they choosed these three SNP and no other ones.
Answer: Because of our existing research conditions and the quite mature detection
methods for these three SNPs, we choosed them.
- In the sequencing verification they took a 10% of the subjects to verify the accuracy
of genotyping I am not convince that this fact should be good enough to this
verification
Answer: This is revised.
- With regards to the results, the authors affirm that the weight of the subjects was not
different at baseline in both groups, - studied and control group-, bur the BMI was a
independent risk factor for the development of DN in the patients having the 3 SNP.
This fact may be conveniently explained.
Answer: The BMI value is related to body weight, as well as height, which can
reflect whether the patient is overweight or obese. It also can be used as an
independent factor to analyze its relationship with SNPs.
MINOR concerns:
Introduction:
-Today the concept of Diabetic Nephropalthy perhaps may be changed to that of
"Diabetic Kidney Disease" (DKD).
Answer: This is revised.
- The incidence of DKD in type 2 DM patients may be estimated in a range between
30 to 40%, or not exactly in 40%, taking into account the data in the Literature.
Answer: This is revised.
- RESULTS. The references to a non signifficant value for p may be expressed as P=
n.s., and not p> 0.05 in all the results along the text.
Answer: This is revised.
- The concepts of TC, HDL-c, LDL-c, BMI and PCR-RFLP may be defined
previously before the initials.
Answer: This is revised.
- The value of these three SNP may be apliccable to the patients with albuminuria,
but can not be applied to the patients with DKD not developping proteinuria, a form
of DKD increasingly present in our patients. Some comment on that may be added.
Answer: This is added.
- The discussion is not really a deep discussion, without a reference to the weaknesses
and strengths of the findings.
Answer: This is added in the Discussion.
- The conclusions are very poor, in order to the applicability of this research to the
daily clinics.
Answer: This is revised.
- Finally, a footnote with the explaination of the initials may be added to all the
tables.
Answer: This is improved.

Gheith O, Farouk N, Nampoory N, Halim MA, Al-Otaibi T. Diabetic kidney disease:
worldwide difference of prevalence and risk factors. J Nephropharmacol. 2016;

Answer: This is added.
2) What was the refusal rate for participation in the study among cases and among
controls? This should be added in the respective section.
Answer: We selected the patients diagnosed with diabetic kidney disease during the
study as the subjects, and this is added.
3) Additional information is necessary regarding the definition of DN patients.
Specifically, were the patients consecutive? Were there any exclusion criteria?
Answer: This is improved in the Materials.
4) Kindly state, how to calculate sample size.
Answer: All the existing patients were screened from patients admitted to our hospital
during the study period. All patients who met the conditions were involved in the
study.
5) Kindly write correct frequency of GA genotype of rs10823108 polymorphism in
Table 2.
Answer: This is revised.
6) The Table3 in their current form present only unadjusted ORs; adjustment for age,
gender, family history, smoking, blood pressure, HbA1C,TC, TG, HDL, LDL and
BMI (all are available to the researchers) should also be performed. The adjusted ORs
and 95%Cls should be presented in Table 3 in an additional column next to the
unadjusted ORs.
Answer: The patient's age, gender, family history, smoking history, and blood
pressure were all displayed on table 1, and there was no significant difference
between the two groups. In the following studies, these factors were not our focus.
