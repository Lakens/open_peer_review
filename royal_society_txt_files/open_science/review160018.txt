Oliver and McDonald present new data on a lineage of geckos from the central uplands region of
Australia that is shown to be highly endemic and relatively ancient in origin. The authors also
review existing data on the biogeographic history of vertebrates from the same region, and show
that several other taxa show similar patterns of diversification in the Miocene, but many taxa
show more recent origins. In the context of the biogeographic history of the Australian arid zone,
and arid zones of the southern Hemisphere, these findings are significant and of broad interest to
vertebrate biologists and palaeobiologists alike. However, presumably while this manuscript has
been in review, a new paper by Kale Sniderman and colleagues has been published (PNAS) on
paleoclimates of the Australian arid zone and the authors really need to place their findings in the
context of this theory, originally presented in the Byrne et al. (2008) paper, that identifies a major
wet period in the early Pliocene. Interestingly, these dates fit nicely with the contrasting Oedura
lineages that the authors focus on in this paper, with one of the lineages dating to the Miocene,
while the other dates to the Pliocene wet period.
Aside from this above issue, the authors need to make some effort to improve the quality of the
manuscript writing. The abstract is rather loosely worded at times and a bit too conversational in
style (e.g. “it is not completely alone”) and there are quite a few typographical errors throughout
the manuscript. Details of methods are often entirely lacking with reference to other papers that
are not open source and several of the analytical methods are unclear, particularly how the data
were phylogenetically analysed, again with reference to methods, but no actual specific details.
Overall, I regard the changes as minor, although there are quite a lot of them.
I present more detail of these issues in the order they were observed:
Abstract: overall, needs tightening up with some specific information on what was actually done
in this paper.
28: “refugia” to “refugium” (if meant to be singular): perhaps bring in the hypothesis of a return
to wet in the Pliocene, following an arid phase after the late Miocene.
28-30: this sentence doesn’t clearly follow from the previous one and the questions need to be put
into context.
30: “biogeography” to “biogeographic history”
33:34: “We then present and describe a new lineage”: specifically what was done in the current
study? i.e. what are the data and what analyses were done to show that there was a new lineage?
34: “that shows a somewhat contrasting pattern” – it is not clear what it is contrasting with.
36-37- “it is not completely alone” – needs re-phrasing or cutting out altogether.
40: add “vertebrate” before “lineages” and cut “at least amongst vertebrates” on the next line
49- as mentioned above, this paragraph should include information from the Sniderman et al.
(2016) PNAS paper
65: Is this statement in regard to vertebrates or animal and plant taxa in general?
72: Insert “populations” after “conspecific”
75-79: The Sniderman et al. (2016) hypothesis is relevant here as well.
77-79: This sentence is left hanging and is consequently unclear.
87:89: Provide some clear aims of the study, rather than just a broad summary of what was found.
3
Methods:
116: “new samples” of what?
117: “University”
118-120: I do not think it is appropriate to refer to other papers for details of methods used in the
current paper, particularly when referencing manuscripts that are not open source. This can be
particularly annoying when you go to that paper to discover that the same thing has been done –
referring to yet another paper to find out the details. The authors should provide full details of
their molecular methods, primers used, regions amplified, PCR conditions and sequencing
approach. This could be provided as supplementary information if there is insufficient space
available in the main manuscript.
128-129: Some additional details should be provided for the ML and BEAST analyses too: Were
the data concatenated with a separate model of evolution for each partition? If so, what model
was used for each partition? Explain what the acronym GTRGAMMA is and give a citation of
where this model came from.
“We used models and partitions as suggested by Partition finder [23] and described previously
[10].” This is not particularly helpful for someone trying to repeat the analyses. What was
suggested by Partition Finder analyses or described previously?
134: I don’t understand why the authors throw all their mtDNA data away for the dating
analysis, when it is likely that only the 3rd codon positions are saturated. Have they included
these data and discovered that it gives them a different result?
143: “and partitioned as per other Bayesian phylogenetic analyses (two partitions)”- again, this
doesn’t give any of the specific information about what the partitions were.
146-8: What criteria are used to exclude the relaxed clock model in favour of a strict clock model?
188: “extent” to “extant”
216: Distances for what gene?
236: “measurements”
340: “know” to “known”
Discussion: needs to be placed into the context of the Sniderman et al. hypothesis. It would also
benefit from some internationalisation and discussion of other similar systems in Australia (e.g.
the Pilbara) as well, where high endemicity has also been recorded. Are there any comparable
systems outside Australia that have been studied for vertebrate endemicity?
385-387: sentence needs reworking and put into context
392: “that” to “the”
402: cut “of”
404: “endemism” to “endemic taxa”
414: cut a “this”, but what is “this” anyway when multiple things are referred to in the preceding
sentence.
443: “and” to “an”
455: “suggest” to “suggests”

I think that this is a straightforward manuscript about the systematics of Oedura with the
description of a new species from central Australia that has been overly complicated for reasons
that are unknown to me. I found the whole section on the central uplands vertebrates confusing
and unnecessary as it is. Maybe a well-done and thorough study of the biota of the central
uplands including a reanalysis of the phylogenetic data (adding new data when necessary)
would be interesting but unfortunately the kind of study (bibliographic compilation) presented
here is not interesting and makes the manuscript unnecessary long. I think that the systematics of
Oedura, with the description of the new endemic taxon from the southern MRB is very
interesting and therefore the authors should be able to produce a much shorter manuscript
concentrating on this genus and the new discovery. They can obviously put it in the broader
context of the central uplands but just as part of the discussion. All that they have about the
central uplands are a few references that can be commented in the discussion. Moreover, by
deleting the central uplands the paper will not need to put so much stress on the calibration
analyses presented in the manuscript and in other manuscripts cited in Table 1. I do not think
that the methods used in the present paper for the calibration analyses are one of the best parts of
the manuscript (in fact are one of the weakest parts), so it is important not to put too much
weight on the calibrations. If the authors were really interested in the origin of the new species
they should have had to put their taxa into a general context of a major tree of Gekkota and apply
several fossil and biogeographic calibrations available instead of applying node ages obtained
from other studies. In summary, I think that the manuscript should be centered in the interesting
genus Oedura and its biogeography and in the description of this interesting new species from
the central uplands.
Results. The authors present phylogenetic trees and maps with no information on the specimens.
Figures 1 and 2 just show the different species in different colors but it is impossible to correlate a
particular terminal in the phylogenetic trees with a sequenced specimen. The authors must
provide all the data either in the figures or as part of the supplementary material (the original
trees).
I found the morphological analyses well thought, executed and presented. The same with the
new species description, very well done and including all the relevant data, illustrations and
information. As I said before, it is a very nice systematic paper.

Comments to the Author:
This manuscript has now been seen by two expert referees, who both agree that it provides some
novel insights into a gecko lineage from Australia. At the same time, both reviewers raise a
number of concners and provide several suggestions, which should be incorporated into a
reivsed version. In parrticular, the authors will need to resctructure their manuscript to better lay
out the background (e.g. the systematics of the Oedura) and to improve the writing.

I found the revision of Paul Oliver and Peter McDonald much improved. I am very happy with
their revision and how they addressed all the comments (I was Referee 2) with the exception of
one comment to Referee 1. Instead of clarifying the parititions selected by PartitionFinder in the
new version of the manuscript they have decided to partition the dataset and to choose the best
model of sequence evolution "by eye" without using any specific software. I do not think that it is
a good practice and I therefore strongly suggest that they use PartitionFinder (or any other
11
software) to set up their partition scheme and to choose the best model of sequence evolution. If
their nDNA has few variable positions I am sure that PartitionFinder will not select a complex
model like GTR+I+G, it should select a much simpler model. As I said, I do not think that not
using specific software for choosing among different partition schemes but especially for model
selection should be an option.

Comments to the Author(s)
I found the revision of Paul Oliver and Peter McDonald much improved. I am very happy with
their revision and how they addressed all the comments (I was Referee 2) with the exception of
one comment to Referee 1. Instead of clarifying the parititions selected by PartitionFinder in the
new version of the manuscript they have decided to partition the dataset and to choose the best
model of sequence evolution "by eye" without using any specific software. I do not think that it is
a good practice and I therefore strongly suggest that they use PartitionFinder (or any other
software) to set up their partition scheme and to choose the best model of sequence evolution. If
their nDNA has few variable positions I am sure that PartitionFinder will not select a complex
model like GTR+I+G, it should select a much simpler model. As I said, I do not think that not
using specific software for choosing among different partition schemes but especially for model
selection should be an option.

Dear Editor,
Thankyou for taking the time to process our manuscript.
Based on the suggestions of the reviewers we have made three major changes to the
manuscript.
First, reviewer 1 made the excellent suggestion of referring directly to a paper recently
published by Sniderman et al 2016 in PNAS that provides compelling evidence that the
expansion of aridity in the Southern Hemisphere since the late Miocene was punctuated
by a warm wet period in the Pliocene. We now use this to set up our paper in the context
of two explicit and testable hypothesis for the origins of Australian Central Uplands
relicts –a) isolation since the initial onset of aridification in the Miocene, or b) or that
their ancestors were widespread through the Pliocene wet pulse, and then isolated by
more recent aridification.
Second – both reviewers raised some questions about how we did our molecular and
dating analyses, and how much information we provided. We now provide a summary of
primers used and sequencing approaches in the supplementary methods files. While this
paper was in review we have also discussed approaches to dating with some colleagues
and based on this have made some further changes. Most importantly the Yule prior,
which is used as standard in dating analyses of this nature, assumes each tip represents a
distinct lineage (i.e species or ESU). To reflect this assumption we have reduced our
sampling for dating analyses down to single examplars. We also discuss in the text and
present in the supplementary material the results from two pairs of dating analysis, one
pair based on the nuclear genes analysed with both strict and uncorrelated lognormal
clock models, and one pair based on the combined nuclear and mtDNA alignment (with
saturated 3rd codons removed) and again analysed with clock and uncorrelated lognormal
models. The behavior of the data including mitochondrial loci strongly suggests that
(even after removal of third codons) the combination of old calibration ages and
mitochondrial data is inflating date estimates (as we have found in previous analyses), so
we focus on the results of the nuclear dataset analysed with the uncorrelated model (most
highly supported). Most importantly however, while there is variation in dates, across all
these analyses the same general conclusion is supported, that the new species diverged
from all other Oedura during the Miocene, while divergence of the recognised taxon the
central ranges (Oedura cincta) is more consistent with Pliocene processes.
Finally - reviewer 1was positive about the biogeographic summary, while reviewer 2 was
negative. We feel that presenting a summary is useful and provides important context for
the new discoveries we present here, and for further work in the area. However to reflect
the comments of reviewer 2 we have tried to de-emphasise this section of the manuscript
to some extent and move it behind the description of the genetic results and the very
distinctive new species. We have also included more background information on the
taxonomy and distribution of Oedura in the introduction.
Please find our detailed responses to the comments of the reviewers below.
Reviewer: 1
Abstract: overall, needs tightening up with some specific information on what was
actually done in this paper.
*The abstract and introduction have been extensively rewritten, and we have
attempted address all the issue raised above
28: “refugia” to “refugium” (if meant to be singular): perhaps bring in the hypothesis of a
return to wet in the Pliocene, following an arid phase after the late Miocene. – *fixed and
done
28-30: this sentence doesn’t clearly follow from the previous one and the questions need
to be put into context. – *no longer relevant as sentence has been deleted
30: “biogeography” to “biogeographic history” – *no longer relevant as section deleted
33:34: “We then present and describe a new lineage”: specifically what was done in the
current study? i.e. what are the data and what analyses were done to show that there was
a new lineage? – *we now say that we do molecular phylogenetic analyses (including
dating) and present morphological data to examine the distinctiveness of Oedura in
the central ranges
34: “that shows a somewhat contrasting pattern” – it is not clear what it is contrasting
with. – *cut
36-37- “it is not completely alone” – needs re-phrasing or cutting out altogether. - cut
40: add “vertebrate” before “lineages” and cut “at least amongst vertebrates” on the next
line - *fixed
49- as mentioned above, this paragraph should include information from the Sniderman
et al. (2016) PNAS paper - *done
65: Is this statement in regard to vertebrates or animal and plant taxa in general? –
*plants, we have clarified this
72: Insert “populations” after “conspecific” - *done
75-79: The Sniderman et al. (2016) hypothesis is relevant here as well. – *added in
77-79: This sentence is left hanging and is consequently unclear. –v cut
87:89: Provide some clear aims of the study, rather than just a broad summary of what
was found. – *done – ‘Using these samples we here test: a) whether these populations
are conspecific with Oedura cincta elsewhere in the Central uplands and b) whether
the divergence of different populations of Oedura in the Central Uplands is most
likely to post- or predate the Pliocene mesic expansion.’
116: “new samples” of what? – *entire paragraph now cut
Methods:
117: “University” *– fixed
118-120: I do not think it is appropriate to refer to other papers for details of methods
used in the current paper, particularly when referencing manuscripts that are not open
source. This can be particularly annoying when you go to that paper to discover that the
same thing has been done – referring to yet another paper to find out the details. The
authors should provide full details of their molecular methods, primers used, regions
amplified, PCR conditions and sequencing approach. This could be provided as
supplementary information if there is insufficient space available in the main manuscript.
128-129: Some additional details should be provided for the ML and BEAST analyses
too: Were the data concatenated with a separate model of evolution for each partition? If
so, what model was used for each partition?
“We used models and partitions as suggested by Partition finder [23] and described
previously [10].” This is not particularly helpful for someone trying to repeat the
analyses. What was suggested by Partition Finder analyses or described previously?
*As noted above we have extensively rewritten the methods section. We no longer
use models as suggested by Partitionfinder (given advice from both Stamakakis
2006, and from expert in our own lab the GTR+I+G which is so often suggested as
the best model has issues). Instead we take a conservative line and use the HKY+G
model for the unpartitioned nuc dataset with is relatively low number of variable
sites, and the GTR+G model for the mit dataset partitioned by codon.
Explain what the acronym GTRGAMMA is and give a citation of where this model came
from. – *I think the reviewer is referred to the GTR CAT model? – we now give
reference to the manual for RAxML where the justification for using this model is
given.
134: I don’t understand why the authors throw all their mtDNA data away for the dating
analysis, when it is likely that only the 3rd codon positions are saturated. Have they
included these data and discovered that it gives them a different result?
*See comments above, in our experience at the deep nodes we have calibration
nodes for, this data is saturated (even after removal of thirds), so we chose to focus
on nuclear data as conservative baseline, but we do now discuss and present results
from the alternative analyses including this data, which tend to give much older
dates – as expected from saturation.
143: “and partitioned as per other Bayesian phylogenetic analyses (two partitions)”-
again, this doesn’t give any of the specific information about what the partitions were.
*See above
146-8: What criteria are used to exclude the relaxed clock model in favour of a strict
clock model?
*Following sentence now added - ‘For each data alignment we also ran both
uncorrelated and strict clock models and compared model likelihoods using AICM
values as implemented in Tracer v.1.6 (Baele et al. 2012). In both cases the
uncorrelated-lognormal model was favoured (for nuclear dataset 24.4 likelihood
units lower, for combined dataset 156.2 units lower).’
188: “extent” to “extant” - *fixed
216: Distances for what gene? – *we now make it clear these are from ND2
236: “measurements” - fixed
340: “know” to “known” - fixed
Discussion: needs to be placed into the context of the Sniderman et al. hypothesis.
*DONE
It would also benefit from some internationalisation and discussion of other similar
systems in Australia (e.g. the Pilbara) as well, where high endemicity has also been
recorded. Are there any comparable systems outside Australia that have been studied for
vertebrate endemicity?
*We have tried to do this to an extent – with comparison to some similar results
from Madagascar, Asia and Africa – but few studies has focused on the timing and
origin of saxicoline endemics (as opposed to just documenting geographic patterns
of endemism) so there is surprisingly little to compare.
385-387: sentence needs reworking and put into context - *fixed
392: “that” to “the” - *fixed
402: cut “of” - *fixed
404: “endemism” to “endemic taxa” - *fixed
414: cut a “this”, but what is “this” anyway when multiple things are referred to in the
preceding sentence. - *cut
443: “and” to “an” - *fixed
455: “suggest” to “suggests” - *fixed

Comments to the Author(s)
Moreover, by deleting the central uplands the paper will not need to put so much stress
on the calibration analyses presented in the manuscript and in other manuscripts cited in
Table 1. I do not think that the methods used in the present paper for the calibration
analyses are one of the best parts of the manuscript (in fact are one of the weakest parts),
so it is important not to put too much weight on the calibrations. If the authors were really
interested in the origin of the new species they should have had to put their taxa into a
general context of a major tree of Gekkota and apply several fossil and biogeographic
calibrations available instead of applying node ages obtained from other studies. In
summary, I think that the manuscript should be centered in the interesting genus Oedura
and its biogeography and in the description of this interesting new species from the
central uplands.
* As stated above we have tried to address these concerns by shifting the order in
which data is presented, and by presenting the results of suite of dating analyses.
Finally we note that the broad priors we used to constrain the ages in the dating
analyses reflect estimates derived from three different studies that independently
estimated timeframes of diversification across geckos, therefore we are basically
doing the reviewer requested. We are very confident that these secondary priors are
sensible and defendable approach to estimating the age of the lineage in question,
and are certainly no less accurate than recapitulating these previous analyses in
order to generate the same result – ie that mean age estimate for the crown
radiation age of the Australian diplodactylids is about 30-35 million years ago – with
a posterior HPD extending about 10 million years in either direction.
Results. The authors present phylogenetic trees and maps with no information on the
specimens. Figures 1 and 2 just show the different species in different colors but it is
impossible to correlate a particular terminal in the phylogenetic trees with a sequenced
specimen. The authors must provide all the data either in the figures or as part of the
supplementary material (the original trees).
*This is standard practice for many recent phylogenetic papers, nonetheless we have
now added treefiles with the requested data to the supplementary material
I found the morphological analyses well thought, executed and presented. The same with
the new species description, very well done and including all the relevant data,
illustrations and information. As I said before, it is a very nice systematic paper.
Minor comments:
L33:of the large saxicoline - *fixed
L38: divergence and distribution - *fixed
L49: Since the Miocene, arid climates.... - *fixed
L51: extirpated? Maybe “become extinct” is more appropriate - *fixed
L91-92: the sentence starting by “However” is wrong, please rephrase - *fixed
L161: Why not regressing against SVL? – *regressing against PCA1 is a standard
practice that captures both body size, and also the potential for non allometric
growth patterns – e.g. McCoy MW, Bolker BM, Osenberg CW, Miner BG, Vonesh
JR (2006) Size correction: comparing morphological traits among populations and
environments. Oecologia 148, 547-554.
L188: allopatric from extant relatives -* fixed
L199: tend to be - *fixed
L204: within the Central Uplands - *fixed
L216: the authors must indicate here the gene used for inferring the genetic distances -
*fixed
L224: but are not applicable to the new taxon... - *fixed
L247-248: indicate in the map from Fig. 2 the locality of the holotype of Oedura derelicta
and the name of the geographical place (Jessie Gap / Alice Springs – *this map is
already quite complicated – we would prefer not to do this, especially as this
synonym is dealt with in detail elsewhere, it is not standard practice to map out the
location of synonyms, and this is not relevant to the main story in this paper either.
L414: delete one “this” - *fixed
Please use n. sp. after the name of the new species otherwise it is confusing to the reader
as many species of Oedura are mentioned- *not using n. sp after first description
appears to be the standard for RSOS, so we have followed this norm, but we are
happy to do otherwise if the editor requests.
Appendix B
Dear editor,
As requested by reviewer two we have also rerun the dataing analyses using a partitioning scheme
selected by partitionfinder for a very previous analysis of a very similar dataset (Oliver et al. 2014). This
analysis suggested that in addition to our current partitioning scheme for ND2, the nuclear dataset
should be split into two partitions - codons 1 and 2, and codon 3. Rereunning the analyses with this
partitioning scheme did not change the overall story - one lineage diverged in the mid to late Miocene
while one lineage is very late Miocene to pliocene. However the overall dates were somewhat younger,
so we have added a new tree to Figure 1 to reflect this. Dates in supplementary table S2 have also been
updated accordingly.
A seperate statement for funding sources has now been added to the end of this document.
We also read through manuscript several times and made a number of small editorial changes to try and
improve clarity and flow.
Kind regards
Paul Oliver
