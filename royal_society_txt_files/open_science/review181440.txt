Well done. This is an excellent paper. This is one of the better papers I've reviewed in recent
memory.
I have only a few minor comments, and none of these are particularly crucial,
Line 34 Keyword “wind farms” are only mentioned in this paper. Perhaps a more directly
applicable keyword would be better.
Line 36 This is an interesting statement: “All moving animals interact with the surrounding
environment […]” Non-moving animals also interact with the environment
Line 40 “Unlike the aquatic environment, air does not provide constant support against gravity.”
This statement is not strictly accurate. Ocean environments have patterns of upwelling,
downwelling and other fluid movements analogous to air movements.
Line 44-46 Awkward passive phrasing
Line 52 Citation needed.
Line 92-95. This is an awkward sentence with particularly ambiguous phrasing used in the
second clause, “[…] behaviours that are opposites in terms of energy expenditure […]” Consider
rewording.
Line 103 The use of the word “hypothesised” is inapt. The subsequent numbered list does not list
hypotheses (viz., proposed explanations of pattern) per se, but rather predictions.
Line 114 Odd spacing
Line 160 Other than “a.g.l.” acronyms are all capital letters without periods between letters. There
isn’t an apparent reason for this inconsistency.
Line 314 Different from what?
Line 322 Accuracy at the optimum threshold should be reported here in addition to AUC.
Figure 3 The information in figure 3 is redundant to the information in the first paragraph of the

In this manuscript, the authors propose an uplift availability map which they derive from
detailed movement tracks of white storks and widely available environmental data sources. I find
the premise of the manuscript in advancing the understating of migration patterns at regional to
continental scales and movement costs of soaring birds, but also in providing guidelines to
development of renewable energy, such as wind turbines. The authors found that while the
availability of thermals can be predicted with relative high accuracy, the models explained only a
minor part of the variation of uplift intensity. Based on the thermal availability map, the authors
show higher flapping and ODBA values at locations in uplift was not predicted by the uplift
availability model. The paper is well written, the analyses are well established and the paper tells
a clear and coherent story.
One question that arises while reading the manuscript is the credibility of the extrapolation of the
uplift availability and intensity models. There are few factors that may result in bias when
estimating the environment based on the movement of animals and more information on the
decisions made in the analyses and their consequences will help to interpret the results. As the
authors state, experience has also a role in determining climb rate in thermals (L416) and
individuals are expected to gather experience during the migration south. Over these effects,
seasonal variation in the availability of thermals should result in higher uplift intensity with time
during the migration south and presumably higher thermal availability. Therefore, variation in
the composition of land use features along the tracks might result in a bias toward higher thermal
availability and intensity for the dominant land use features found at the southern parts of the
tracks. The use of an additional dataset that was collected at different season or that was retrieved
from different soaring species at the extrapolated range or may help to generalize the results and
to increase the credibility of the proposed maps as proxies for an aerial energy landscape for
soaring birds.
L74 - This statement is true at a global scale.
L80 – I would guess that it would be more correct to state that thermal columns are invisible to us
as humans. There are other signs as clouds or other birds that might be used by soaring birds.
L218 – On low flight altitudes, soaring birds might flap also in thermals – when taking off or to
cross the sink that may be found at the periphery of the thermal. Therefore, at least at low flight
altitudes, flapping flight won’t always reflect the absence of thermals.
L288 – 30 seconds?
L307-309 – Consider to provide individual means.
L358 - The observation that proximity to dumps, water bodies and pastures negatively affected
uplift intensity might be related and taking off or landing at sleeping or foraging sites. Setting a
4
threshold value of flight altitude of few hundred meters may solve this issue (L174).
L410 – Consider to mention here that the performance is affected by the resolution of the dynamic
environmental variables.
L435 - One aspect that may be important to predict uplift suitability and intensity is the local
spatial variation in the variables. While the authors observed how ground surface changes at
local scale (e.g., slope), I would suggest to mention or take into account local changes in land use
– for example, a road in a city will not have the same effect as a road in the middle of an open
area.
Figure 5 – I would consider to show the tracks on this plot instead of figure 1 (or in both).

Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Well done. This is an excellent paper. This is one of the better papers I've
reviewed in recent memory.
I have only a few minor comments, and none of these are particularly crucial,
1. Line 34 Keyword “wind farms” are only mentioned in this paper. Perhaps a
more directly applicable keyword would be better.
We agree with the reviewer that the keyword “wind farm” was not well
justified in the text. However, we think that the output of this study could offer
an important base for further analyses dealing with collision risks and
planning of anthropogenic infrastructure and we would like to make this
study visible for the respective readership. We therefore tried to clarify the
conservation implications of this study in the abstract (lines 29-32) and we
generalized the keywork to “anthropogenic infrastructure”. The implications
of the study are also addressed in the discussion at lines 460-476.
2. Line 36 This is an interesting statement: “All moving animals interact with
the surrounding environment […]” Non-moving animals also interact with the
environment
We agree and we slightly modified the sentence.
3. Line 40 “Unlike the aquatic environment, air does not provide constant
support against gravity.” This statement is not strictly accurate. Ocean
environments have patterns of upwelling, downwelling and other fluid
movements analogous to air movements.
We thank the reviewer for pointing out this incorrect comparison between the
two environments. The modified sentence only focuses on the aerial
environment (lines 40-42).
4. Line 44-46 Awkward passive phrasing
We agree and turned the sentence into active form to improve readability
(lines 45-47).
5. Line 52 Citation needed.
We now rephrased the sentence and added a reference.
6. Line 92-95. This is an awkward sentence with particularly ambiguous
phrasing used in the second clause, “[…] behaviours that are opposites in
terms of energy expenditure […]” Consider rewording.
We rephrased the sentence to improve readability.
7. Line 103 The use of the word “hypothesised” is inapt. The subsequent
numbered list does not list hypotheses (viz., proposed explanations of
pattern) per se, but rather predictions.
We agree and we changed the word “hypothesised” to “predicted”.
8. Line 114 Odd spacing
This was due to a compatibility problem between two operative systems. We
now solved the problem.
9. Line 160 Other than “a.g.l.” acronyms are all capital letters without periods
between letters. There isn’t an apparent reason for this inconsistency.
We agree and we changed it to “height above ground” to avoid confusion.
10. Line 314 Different from what?
The wording was unclear, we now changed the sentence to “multiple
environmental predictors”.
11. Line 322 Accuracy at the optimum threshold should be reported here in
addition to AUC.
As noticed by the reviewer, the AUC values reported at line 328 for the three
models are threshold-independent accuracy measurements. However, at
lines 337 to 339 we also report the sensitivity and specificity, which are
threshold-dependent accuracy measurements which indicate the number of
presences and absences correctly classified by the model. The reported
values of sensitivity and specificity correspond to the optimal threshold of 0.9
and in the text are reported only for the static model. The complete model
evaluation can be found in table S3.1 of the supplementary material. In this
table we report sensitivity, specificity and true skill statistics of the three uplift
suitability models at different threshold values.
12. Figure 3 The information in figure 3 is redundant to the information in the
first paragraph of the results, and should be removed.
We agree and we moved Fig. 3 to the supplementary material (now Figure
S1.3). At lines 314 and 316 we also added individual means to the result as
suggested by reviewer 2 (comment 18).

Comments to the Author(s)
In this manuscript, the authors propose an uplift availability map which they
derive from detailed movement tracks of white storks and widely available
environmental data sources. I find the premise of the manuscript in
advancing the understating of migration patterns at regional to continental
scales and movement costs of soaring birds, but also in providing guidelines
to development of renewable energy, such as wind turbines. The authors
found that while the availability of thermals can be predicted with relative
high accuracy, the models explained only a minor part of the variation of
uplift intensity. Based on the thermal availability map, the authors show
higher flapping and ODBA values at locations in uplift was not predicted by
the uplift availability model. The paper is well written, the analyses are well
established and the paper tells a clear and coherent story.
13. One question that arises while reading the manuscript is the credibility of
the extrapolation of the uplift availability and intensity models. There are few
factors that may result in bias when estimating the environment based on the
movement of animals and more information on the decisions made in the
analyses and their consequences will help to interpret the results. As the
authors state, experience has also a role in determining climb rate in
thermals (L416) and individuals are expected to gather experience during
the migration south. Over these effects, seasonal variation in the availability
of thermals should result in higher uplift intensity with time during the
migration south and presumably higher thermal availability. Therefore,
variation in the composition of land use features along the tracks might result
in a bias toward higher thermal availability and intensity for the dominant
land use features found at the southern parts of the tracks. The use of an
additional dataset that was collected at different season or that was retrieved
from different soaring species at the extrapolated range or may help to
generalize the results and to increase the credibility of the proposed maps as
proxies for an aerial energy landscape for soaring birds.
We thank the reviewer for this consideration. Indeed the use of data from
additional species and different seasons could help generalizing our
prediction and validate our extrapolations, and we now acknowledge this in
the discussion (lines 456-459). Random forest techniques cannot reliably
extrapolate outside the range of predictor values used in the training phase.
For this reason, when extrapolating the predictions of our model to different
areas, we limited our predictions to only the range of predictor values
included in the training phase (this procedure is described in the methods at
lines 238-242 and 276-279).
Latitude was included as predictor in a previous version of both the uplift
suitability and intensity models. In a subsequent step, latitude was however
excluded from the uplift suitability model due to its low contribution, allowing
us to extrapolate our prediction to the entire latitudinal range of the study
area. The same was not possible in the case of the uplift intensity model,
whose extrapolation is in fact constrained to a smaller latitudinal range, since
the latitude remained among the predictors due to its higher contribution.
The positive relationship between the lower latitude values and the uplift
intensity was discussed only in relation to the potential higher availability of
thermals at lower latitudes. Therefore, we now include the additional
perspective of the acquired experience of the young birds, which might have
improved their flight performance (and therefore climbing rate) while
migrating South (lines 448-451).
14. L74 - This statement is true at a global scale.
We agree with the reviewer and we slightly rephrased the sentence to
improve clarity, without changing the overall content (lines 74-78). In fact, our
sentence does not want to refer to a local scale, but rather to a fine-scale
(spatial and/or temporal) turbulence. This is why weather products that are
publicly available, with low spatial and temporal resolution, seem not to be
able to capture these fine-scale variations.
15. L80 – I would guess that it would be more correct to state that thermal
columns are invisible to us as humans. There are other signs as clouds or
other birds that might be used by soaring birds.
We agree with the reviewer, our sentence was inaccurate. We now
rephrased it (lines 82-84).
16. L218 – On low flight altitudes, soaring birds might flap also in thermals –
when taking off or to cross the sink that may be found at the periphery of the
thermal. Therefore, at least at low flight altitudes, flapping flight won’t always
reflect the absence of thermals.
We thank the reviewer for this point. Indeed, the use of flapping flight to
identify the absence of thermals is a big assumption in the uplift suitability
model, and we now made this assumption more explicit at lines 172-177. In
fact, while the soaring behaviour implies the presence of an uplift, the same
cannot be said for the flapping behaviour, which could be triggered in
different situations, such as taking off, entering or centering a thermal or for
instance in response to disturbance from individuals of the same or other
species. Therefore in our presence/absence model we are confident in the
location of the presence of uplift but we cannot be as confident with the
locations of the absences.
We agree with considering a threshold of 100 m above ground as an
arbitrary choice to distinguish the flapping used as a consequence of taking
off or centering a thermal from the flapping used in absence of thermals. We
therefore looked at the altitudinal distribution of flapping (all active bursts,
before applying a threshold), and we weighted it for the altitudinal distribution
of our accelerometry data. Fig. A shows the distribution of our accelerometry
data (ACC bursts) at different altitudes and illustrates how most of these data
were collected at lower altitudes (below 100); Fig. B shows the proportion of
active bursts (flapping) in relation to the distribution of all ACC data collected.
In both barplots, each bin corresponds to 100 m. The figures show that if we
were prone to include erroneous flapping locations, from the proportion of
flapping flight in Fig. B we should expect to have a bias at higher altitudes.
Fig. B suggests that the proportion of flapping flight is quite low below 100 m
and increases towards higher altitudes, with a peak around 2600 m above
ground. It seems that it is difficult to define a non-arbitrary threshold to
distinguish the two types of flapping flight, while the threshold of 100 m that
we used seems to reflect a change in the altitudinal distribution of the
flapping proportion. As we could not find firm evidence that advocated for
another threshold, we decided to keep the threshold we used before.
17. L288 – 30 seconds?
We realized that the sentence could lead to confusion. We actually meant 0
second and we now rephrased the sentence to avoid ambiguity (lines 290-
292).
18. L307-309 – Consider to provide individual means.
We maintained the cumulated values for all individuals as a description of
the complete dataset used in the models. In addition, we calculated and
present now the average proportion and standard deviation of soaring and
flapping time per individual (lines 314 and 316).
19. L358 - The observation that proximity to dumps, water bodies and
pastures negatively affected uplift intensity might be related and taking off or
landing at sleeping or foraging sites. Setting a threshold value of flight
altitude of few hundred meters may solve this issue (L174).
We thank the reviewer for this comment. We now added an additional
interpretation of the model results related to the internal motivation of the bird
(migrating vs foraging) at lines 426-431 of the discussion. However, we
decided not to change the threshold value in the flight altitude, as explained
in response to comment 16.
20. L410 – Consider to mention here that the performance is affected by the
resolution of the dynamic environmental variables.
The results of our uplift intensity model show that not only dynamic (lower
resolution), but also static (higher resolution) environmental variables are
insufficient to predict the intensity of the uplifts (line 417). Therefore, the
resolution of the dynamic variables alone is not a sufficient explanation for
the unexplained variance in the uplift intensity models in our view. This is
why we decided to first address different issues that could justify the
inconsistency of the environment-uplift intensity relationship (such as
experience of the individuals, morpholgy and leadership), that are mainly
related to the use of the birds’ climbing rate as a proxy of uplift intensity
(lines 420-434). Only then we address the resolution of the dynamic
environmental variables as a further source of inconsistency (addressed
from line 434 to 440).
21. L435 - One aspect that may be important to predict uplift suitability and
intensity is the local spatial variation in the variables. While the authors
observed how ground surface changes at local scale (e.g., slope), I would
suggest to mention or take into account local changes in land use – for
example, a road in a city will not have the same effect as a road in the
middle of an open area.
We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comment. Indeed local changes in
land use might have an effect on the uplift availability, which is something we
mention at lines 465-468 of the discussion. In our model we tried not to
include too many variables, as our model was aimed to provide a
simplification of the uplift prediction. In addition, the land data contributed
less than other variables to the final prediction (Suppl. 3 Fig.3.3). However,
in a previous version of the uplift suitability models we did include some local
statistics on NDVI and on topographic variables, also to partially account for
the different scales at which we could have run the model. These resulting
rasters were highly correlated with the original ones, and were therefore
excluded from the models. The local statistics were computed as the
difference between the value of a cell and the mean value of its 8
surrounding cells (3*3 average, 300*300 m) and 48 surrounding cells (7*7
average, 700*700 m). Only three of these layers were mantained in the final
model (aspect unevenness, slope unevennes and roughness), for which the
computing procedure is explained in Suppl. 2.
22. Figure 5 – I would consider to show the tracks on this plot instead of
figure 1 (or in both).
We agree with the reviewer but we thought that overlaying the tracks on the
two maps would have decreased readability. We therefore combined Fig. 1
and Fig. 5 in one figure, in order to provide the reader with a reference of the
position of the tracks (Fig. 1 A) near the two prediction maps (Now Fig. 1 B
and C).
23. Figure S1.2 – What is the source of the data on Griffon vultures?
We are thankful to the reviewer for noticing this error in the supplementary
material. In an early version of the manuscript we included some griffon
vulture data. We then modified the text and the figures but not the figure
caption. We apologize for the oversight which we have now corrected.
