This comment submission concerns what appears to be an on-going dispute in the literature over
the phase transitions in a family of urea inclusion compounds. These are famous examples of
incommensturately modulated structures, and the two “sides” in the dispute include those best
known in this area. I refer to the “sides” as Couzi and Toudic below.
As a reviewer it is difficult to appreciate all the complexities of the scientific and non-scientific
arguments that have lead to this point. Having read this comment, the papers it refers to and the
earlier comment in Europhys Lett [3], my understanding of the situation is that: 1. Couzi et al
published reference [2] on “phase III” of an inclusion compound. 2. Toudic et al published a
comment in reference [3] presenting evidence that the work had in fact been performed on
“phase II”. 3. The comment in reference [3] wasn’t challenged by Couzi at the time. 4. The RSOS
paper by Couzi [1] doesn’t properly acknowledge the comment in [3], and still assumes reference
[2] was indeed on “phase III”, which is at best misleading.
If my understanding in the previous paragraph is correct, then it would seem appropriate that
Toudic et al are given an opportunity to publish this comment. I would hope that its content
would be shared with Couzi so that both sides get an opportunity to publish their comments
and/or rebuttal side-by-side. This would seem the quickest and cleanest way to reach a
conclusion and would give minimum confusion for future workers in the field.
I do have some specific comments on the contents of the submission. Some are scientific and
some more about the tone of the submission. These latter points are more editorial and I am
happy for the editors to decide on what they think is appropriate.
- The comment could perhaps be shorter without losing any content or impact. This would help
the reader. I suggest some areas below.
- The crux of the dispute appears to be the temperature at which Couzi’s work in reference [2]
was performed and the implication on the phase present. The comment contains some reference
to phase transition temperatures as TC1/TC2, but it would be helpful to have a short summary of
the accepted temperature range for each phase, how it was determined, whether it is disupted,
and whether there is any hysteresis involved. There should then be a clear statement on why
they believe Toudic measured phase II. This would allow Couzi et al to explicitly state the
reasons why they believe they are in Phase III.
- In paragraph 1 the word “attempt” should be removed. I would suggest changing “arguments
rest solely” to “arguments seem to rest solely”.
- The final two sentences in paragraph 2 about the “upmost care” and giving details of
instruments used by Couzi don’t seem necessary at this point. For me they seem to imply the
other work wasn’t done carefully; it’s possible for the other work to be carefully performed even
if it proves to be incorrect.
- The wording on P2 “In that Comment….basis for their model” read to me like a letter to the
editor rather than a scientific comment. I feel that the key points can be made without directly
confrontational language.
- The phrase “simply not true” should be replaced by “incorrect”.

situation from the information presented, but this is unlikely to be perfect. If this review is

I have read the authors comments on, and responses to, my first review. I am happy with all the
changes that they have made and strongly recommend prompt publication of this comment.
As I stated in my original review, I hope the comment is shared with Couzi et al so that they have
an opportunity to respond to it. Ideally any response would be published alongside the
comment. My personal view is that it is important that this comment gets published promptly as
the situation seems to have been on-going for some time (I have reviewed within 12 hours for this
reason). If the journal goes down this simultaneous-response route I would therefore strongly
recommend a short deadline be placed on Couzi et al for response (e.g. 4 weeks including
[expedited] review time).
I have to say that I share the authors' feelings about the one-line reviews given by reviewers 2
and 3. Perhaps they made more detailed comments in confidence to the editors? If not, their
reviews (particularly referee 2) seem to significantly underestimate the issues being presented in
the articles and comments. I was personally disappointed at the apparent lack of critical
assessment in these reviews.

February 25th, 2019
Dear Editor,
We are facing an original and quite distressing experience. For more than 20 years, we have
accumulated the highest quality results on the structural instabilities of n-alkane/urea inclusion
compounds, considering particularly the fully deuterated n-nonadecane/urea (deuterated because of the
extensive use of coherent neutron scattering). M. Couzi et al. have made a single, extremely poor
diffraction study on a fully hydrogenated n-nonadecane/urea, with only two temperatures measured to
characterize three phases! And it appears that we are treated almost equally in terms of the work done.
Much more serious, Couzi et al. use their measurements at two temperatures to claim in your journal
hat they have demonstrated that all of our work is incorrect. We maintain that our primary demand is
he withdrawal of their article if they cannot demonstrate, as we have asked from the beginning, that
heir data were measured following a standard scientific protocol that they must provide to the journal.
It is very hard for us to understand why two of the referees limited their responses to one line.
Of course, we cannot comment on these reports, simply stating again that we expect that M. Couzi et
al. will answer the following single question. What control experiments did they perform to ensure
hat they were indeed measuring phase II of n-nonadecane/urea in their study, rather than phase III?
We thank referee 1 for examining our paper carefully. They stress the difficulty of
understanding the problem, and write that a shorter comment would be stronger. As a consequence, we
have decided to slightly shorten this Comment, focusing on what is most important.
Before responding to the referee’s specific comments, we would first like to clarify any
confusion there may be about phase II (which exists between Tc1 and Tc2), and phase III (which exists
at Tc2 and below):
a) Couzi et al. argue that their measurement at 147 K in the fully hydrogenated n-nonadecane/urea is
n phase II. They made a second measurement at 100 K and they found that these two measurements
were identical from the crystallographic point of view. So they have concluded that phase II and phase
II are the same phase.
b) Since Couzi et al. reported diffraction patterns at only two temperatures, it appears that they did not
ry to determine Tc1H (H for the fully hydrogenated n-nonadecane-h40/urea-h4), or at least to calibrate
heir study since Tc1H is rather well established in the literature (Tc1H = 158.8 K). (Note that Tc1D =
149.4 K for n-nonadecane-d40/urea-d4).
And more importantly, they have not tried to determine Tc2H, which has never been determined by
anyone by diffraction. Concerning Tc2H, we must therefore refer to adiabatic calorimetry studies, in
which a second transition was reported at Tc2H = 147.0K.
These values are now given in the Comment:
We have shown that in n-nonadecane-d40/urea-d4 and n-nonadecane-h40/urea-h4, there is a complex
equence of phases that follow crystallographic symmetry conditions. The first phase transition at Tc1
s associated with the symmetry breaking from the hexagonal high temperature phase to a second
phase (phase II); a second transition to a different space group (phase III) occurs at a lower
emperature Tc2.... For n-nonadecane-h40/urea-h4, Tc1 = (158.8 <U+F0B1> 0.1) K and Tc2 = (147.0 <U+F0B1> 0.1) K,
according to adiabatic measurements [10]."
"10. López-Echarri A, Ruiz-Larrea I, Fraile-Rodríguez A, Díaz-Hernández J, Breczewski T,
Bocanegra EH 2007. Phase transitions in the urea/n-nonadecane system by calorimetric techniques, J.
Phys. Condens. Matter, 19, 186221. (doi:10.1088/0953-8984/19/18/186221)"
In paragraph 1...
We have rewritten the introduction since it appears that the problem was a bit difficult to understand
by nonspecialists:
In their recent article [1], M. Couzi et al. develop a standard phenomenological model of coupled
order parameters, which generates one single symmetry-breaking phase transition. They apply it to
he phase transitions of n-nonadecane/urea and n-hexadecane/urea, while knowing that our
measurements have demonstrated, via previously published diffraction experiments [2-6], that both
undergo at least two symmetry breaking events revealed by systematic absences of diffraction peaks."
The final two sentences in paragraph 2...
In fact the "upmost care" and the details of instruments referred to the work by Toudic et al., not that
of Couzi et al. We have shortened these lines:
These results have been discussed extensively in the literature [3,4,6-9] and were obtained using
excellent spatial resolution and temperature calibration, including measurements using cold neutron
cattering on triple axis spectrometers [3,4], and on a synchrotron X-ray diffractometer [7]."
The wording on P2...
We agree that the text is written in such a way that it makes reference at the same time to the first
Comment in EPL (ref. 2) and to their Article in RSOS (ref. 1). Once again, the difficulty comes from
he fact that Couzi et al. totally ignored the content of our Comment in EPL and even worse, they used
our Comment to say in RSOS that they had demonstrated that we were wrong. (In fact, for us this
emains a deliberate lie and an error that the referees of RSOS should have seen.)
To refocus on the present Comment, we have made some slight changes in the new version:
In the same Comment [2], to which there was no reply, we asked Couzi et al. to explain how their
measurements were actually made,...”
"However in their present article [1], Couzi et al. make the following surprising statement..."
The phrase "simply not true"...
The way Couzi et al. treats n-hexadecane/urea is very insidious since they did not even try to make
any new measurements to verify their interpretation. They simply reinterpret our data in an attempt to
demonstrate again that phase II and phase III would be the same, claiming that their Article in EPL
constitutes proof, without them introducing any new evidence. We have already discussed this
extensively in our Comment in EPL, showing that the sequence of phases in n-nonadecane/urea and n-
hexadecane/urea are totally different. Since we have already answered that point in our previous
Comment, and since nothing new concerning n-hexadecane/urea has been discussed by Couzi et al. in
label_version_3
RSOS, we have withdrawn this final part, following the request of the referee to focus on the main
points. We, of course, invite the readers to see our previous detailed answer in the Comment in EPL:
As already extensively argued in our previous Comment [2], we maintain also that two different
ymmetry breaking events are indeed present in n-hexadecane/urea."
We hope that these modifications, following the referee’s advice, will allow the publication of
his Comment.
