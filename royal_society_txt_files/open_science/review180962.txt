This manuscript reports on the chemical synthesis of HAp powders where the pH of the reaction
mixture was controlled as well as the sintering temperature post synthesis. The solution pH and
sintering temperature were found to influence the composition, morphology and crystallinity of
the final product. The products were characterised by a range of techniques. Overall the study is
carried out reasonably well, however none of the results are surprising and mostly to be
expected. In terms of novelty it is not clear what advantage this has over other methods of HAp
synthesis and this point should be strengthened – such as are the chemical, physical and
mechanical properties improved?
The following points should also be considered
There must be consistency when naming HAp – on some occasions it is written as “Hap” or
“HAP”
In the discussion it is mentioned that the “solution becomes more soluble” – this does not make
sense
Also the part of the sentence “Additionally, increased pH…of particles [47-49]…” needs to be re-
phrased.
The section regarding the growth mechanism is speculative and needs to be strengthened. The
authors claim that OH- ions are directing the growth of their material – this is a bit speculative as
there is little evidence of directional growth in the SEM images. The few elongated structures
seen do not indicate that the growth mechanism occurs like this. The main point I believe that can
be drawn from these images is that the particles coalesce and get bigger upon increasing the
temperature.
Figure 1 is a standard chemical synthesis setup and does not need to be included.
The language needs to be addressed throughout the manuscript and at times makes the science
difficult to understand.
Overall this work reports on a synthesis method for HAp with unsurprising results but would be
useful for those interested in making this material.

1. As of now, many reports have been published on the effect of sintering temperature and pH
variation on nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite. Can you point out the significance of your present
study?

nanoparticles, 2. N.Y. Mostafa, Characterization, thermal stability and sintering of hydroxyapatite

not clear”, Can you provide the particles size distribution histograms?

be crystallite size not particle size. Please change the sentence.
5. In discussion section, the sentence you mentioned that “Furthermore, increase in the pH to 11,
widens again the Ca/P ratio and restricts the growth due to the presence of more OH- ions,
which resulted in rod like structure (marked with blue circles in Figure 2i).”

Response to reviewers:
Reviewer: 1
This manuscript reports on the chemical synthesis of HAp powders
where the pH of
the reaction mixture was controlled as well as the sintering temperature
post synthesis. The solution pH and sintering temperature were found
to influence the composition, morphology and crystallinity of the final
product. The products were characterised by a range of techniques.
Overall the study is carried out reasonably well, however none of the
results are surprising and mostly to be expected. In terms of novelty it
is not clear what advantage this has over other methods of
HAp synthesis and this point should be strengthened – such as are
the chemical, physical and mechanical properties improved?
The following points should also be considered
There must be consistency when naming HAp – on some occasions it
is written as “Hap” or “HAP”
Ans: All the manuscript has been revised and changed the “Hap” to
“HAP”.
In the discussion it is mentioned that the “solution becomes more
soluble” – this does not make sense. Also the part of the sentence
“Additionally, increased pH…of particles [47-49]…” needs to be re-
phrased.
Ans: The above sentences and the overall discussion part have been
rephrased.
The section regarding the growth mechanism is speculative and needs
to be strengthened. The authors claim that OH- ions are directing the
growth of their material – this is a bit speculative as there is little
evidence of directional growth in the SEM images. The few elongated
structures seen do not indicate that the growth mechanism occurs like
this. The main point I believe that can be drawn from these images is
that the particles coalesce and get bigger upon increasing
the temperature.
Ans: Authors agree with the referee comments but necessary evidences
for our hypothesis of the growth mechanism and additional explanation
has been added in the discussion part of the article.
Figure 1 is a standard chemical synthesis setup and does not need to
be included.
Ans: According to the reviewer suggestion Figure 1 has been removed.
The language needs to be addressed throughout the manuscript and
at times makes the science difficult to understand.
Ans: Language corrections have been made and improved throughout
the manuscript.
Reviewer: 2
1. As of now, many reports have been published on
the effect of sintering temperature and pH variation nanocrystalline
hydroxyapatite.
Can you point out the significance of your present study?
In this regard, please refer the following articles: “1. Y.X. Pang et al.
Influence of temperature, ripening time and calcination on the
morphology and crystallinity of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, 2. N.Y.
Mostafa, Characterization, thermal stability
and sintering of hydroxyapatite powders prepared by different
routes, 3. Tas et al. An investigation of the chemical synthesis and
high-temperature sintering behaviour of

concentration on the sintering behavior and mechanical properties
of hydroxyapatite, 5. M. Rajkumar et al. Preparation of size controlled,
stoichiometric and bioresorbable hydroxyapatite nanorod by varying
initial pH, Ca/P ratio and sintering temperature”.
Ans: Thanks for the references suggested by the referee, after
considering the references, the novelty or significance of this work has
been added in both introduction and discussion part of the manuscript.
2. In SEM analysis, you have written the sentence “An increase in
the sintering temperature induced the growth of the particle size from
teen of nanometers to some micrometers”, which is not clear”, Can
you provide the particles size distribution histograms?
Ans: Histograms of the particle size distribution were added in the
manuscript as Figure. 2.
3. In table 1, you have listed the calculated Ca/P ratios using EDS
analysis. You didn’t show EDS spectra in the manuscript, it could be
much better if you include EDS spectra.
Ans: EDS spectra was also added in the manuscript as Figure. 4
4. In XRD analysis, you have calculated the particle size using
Scherrer equation, it supposed to be crystallite size not particle size.
Please change the sentence.
Ans: Corresponding changes have been made as per the suggestions.
5. In discussion section, the sentence you mentioned that
“Furthermore, increase in the pH to 11, widens again the Ca/P ratio
and restricts the growth due to the presence of more OH- ions, which
resulted in rod like structure (marked with blue circles in Figure 2i).”
The rod-like morphology is not clearly observed in figure 2(i). If you
provide TEM images that could be more evident.
Ans: TEM images of the samples for observing the rod like morphology
was added as Figure 5 in the manuscript.
• How the residues can change the morphology. Any Ref
Ans: Reference 35 and 36 were added in the manuscript in order to
confirm the effect of residues.
• EDS is not a prescribed tool to confirm Ca/p ratio. Have you
confirmed with ICP.
Ans: According to the literature and different other works suggested by
the referee EDS is a very common technique for obtaining the Ca/P ratio
of the HAP nanostructures. Although we agree with the review that it
is not a prescribed technique but due to the lack of time and other issues
we couldn’t perfume the ICP technique.
• Author mentioned According to the Scherrer equation, the
particle size for HAp was the range from 20 to 56 nm. Is that particle
size or crystallite size.
Ans: Its crystallite size, corresponding changes were made in the
manuscript.
• This sentence is not clear “where the reduction in strain and
defect density of the crystal is corroborated. The presence of CaHPO4
was observed for samples sintered at 700 and 900 oC, and it is due to
the increase of the chemical reaction between the species presents that
resulting in agglomeration and formation of new compounds”.
Ans: The sentence has been changed and rewritten in the manuscript.
