label_comment_1
In the interest of full transparency, I wish to declare that Dr. Bishop and myself are part of a
consortium of researchers who seek to improve the quality and reliability of empirical science.
Nevertheless I have tried to remain objective and impartial, an attempt that was helped by the
fact that Dr. Bishop is critiquing the initiative that I signed onto at an early stage.
Before continuing, I should stress that I believe an open discussion on this issues is highly
desirable. If somebody of Dr. Bishop's track record in Open Science feels the PRO initiative is
flawed, this certainly warrants attention. I do believe that the many arguments made in this
manuscript can be tweaked, better structured, and sometimes entirely omitted.
My main complaint is that after reading the article, I am not really sure what point the author is
making. Yes, researchers may originally not like the extra effort associated with sharing their
data; but what is at issue here is whether data sharing is good scientific practice. If it is, then
researchers should do it, no matter their preference for going to the pub instead. Also, the
author's suggestion for a different initiative appears to be dead on arrival (point 4 below). Finally,
the argument that more data means more opportunity to snoop is as truthful as it is trivial, and
could be used as an argument to stop doing empirical work altogether (point 8 below).
Major comments.
1. "The goal of the PROI is to encourage the editor to go back to the author to ask for the data."
That is not the main goal, at least not for me. The main goal is to convince the journals and editors
that they should encourage data-sharing more than they do now, because that is the only way in
which it will become a generally accepted practice. I believe that several statements in the original
paper strongly convey the idea that the goal is to encourage a broader adoption of data sharing
practices.
2. "It could be said that part of the purpose of PROI is to put pressure on editors." Indeed it is, at
least as far as I'm concerned.
3. "However, they may respond by finding another reviewer, rather than complying with a
reviewer request that does not reflect journal policy. If that happens, nothing is gained other than
ill will from author and editor."
That is a possibility. But even in this case something is gained: the reviewer can dedicate his or
her limited time to contributions that do meet elementary standards of scientific discourse. What
if reviewers were confronted with papers that used inappropriate language, missed entire
method sections, or contained unreadable figures? Clearly reviewers can make some demands
when this happens. Would the author argue that in these cases an immediate request for revision
imposes an unreasonable burden on the authors, who now have to clean their language, write
new method sections, and produce readable figures? They should be happy the paper is not
rejected out of hand. At this point in the paper, I felt myself wondering "where is this going?". I
believe the author needs to structure the arguments better, perhaps even as a numbered list.
3
4. "Peer reviewers could undertake not to review for journals that do not mandate open data –
and if asked to do so, they should make clear the reason for refusing."
This solution is even more radical than PRO. Precious few journals currently mandate data
sharing, and so reviewers who sign on to the author's initiative will have to do almost no
reviewing at all anymore. First, this is not helpful to the field. Second, these reviewers can no
longer submit work to journals they refuse to review for (this would be parasitic and morally
wrong), so they have effectively committed career suicide. The conclusion is that the author's
suggestion is unworkable.
5. "I think the PROI in its current form risks making authors feel unjustly penalised, and editors
feel that reviewers are stepping beyond their remit."
Any author who feels punished for being asked to make the data available should seek a different
profession. The only reason why authors may feel penalised now is because the request can be
viewed as unorthodox. As more reviewers sign PRO, this will change and sharing will
(hopefully) become the default. As far as editors are concerned, I am confident that they will
realize the demand is reasonable, and that reviewers are providing their services gratis. As an
action editor, I have recently had a reviewer refuse an invitation because he did not review for
Elsevier. I think there is nothing wrong with that whatsoever.
Suppose two children walk into a store to steal some candy. One child gets caught and
reprimanded. Perhaps this child may feel unjustly penalised, but that is not a reason to forego the
reprimande. Occasional reprimandes may encourage children to do the right thing. Stealing is
wrong, and so is hiding your data from scrutiny while still seeking to publish the statistical
summary in a peer-reviewed journal.
6. "However, this raises the question of what are valid reasons." This is impossible to assess in
generality and up to the individual reviewer to determine. Submitting an article to a journal also
raises the question of what is a good article.
7. "However, if secondary analysts focus on sensitive issues, such as effects related to gender,
psychiatric status, political allegiance or race, we need to be aware that, unless participants gave
permission for this extension of the analysis, it could be unethical and possibly illegal. This is true
not just of patient data, but also for studies of individual differences in non-patient samples."
I just don't see this (at all). Please provide a more concrete example where the new analysis harms
the participant in any meaningful way.
8. "Any large, multivariate dataset provides ample opportunities for p-hacking – i.e. digging
around in the data to look for ‘interesting’ patterns that give significant results."
Absolutely, and this is why there is preregistration (as the author later acknowledges explicitly).
Knifes provide ample opportunities for stabbing people, but as long as they are used for cooking
they are widely approved. The author's argument would caution against any method of data
collection – more data means more opportunity for snooping. Although this is true, the solution
to stop data collection is throwing away the baby with the bathwater.

This commentary discusses important questions regarding open data sharing. I don't agree that
all of the points the author raises are really major concerns but they are all valid discussion points
that can and doubtless will be debated after publication. Given the fact that the author has long
been a vocal proponent of open science this sober reflection on the issues is a great contribution to
the discussion. I just want to add a few points that could be clarified (although I don't think this is
needed):
1. My understanding of the PROI (and one reason I chose to sign the initiative after some
deliberation) is that reviewers ask for a statement about data availability. It is not about having a
"good reason" for not sharing. That judgement is not one the reviewers should be making. All
they should request is an explanation why data are not available. The hope is that in the longer
run this will lead not only to increased data sharing but greater transparency about when and
why data can't be shared. I don't think delays are a substantial issue given how long the review
process takes in general.
2. I am a bit perplexed by the notion of independent arbiters or preregistered plans for
reanalysing published datasets. This idea implies that data are only being released after such a
preregistration has been received. Is this what the author is arguing? I don't agree that this is a
sensible course for most research (although it can be advisable for controversial research). But in
most situations the logistically simplest form of data transparency is to make the data publicly
available. It is true that biased parties can dredge the data and in my view the best defence
against this is ultimately transparency. If someone fishes in the public data for evidence
supporting their biased assumptions but ignores the large number of null findings this can easily
be demonstrated because the data are visible to all.
