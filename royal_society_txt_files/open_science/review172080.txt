The manuscript by Scrutton-Alvarado and Stevenson describes using massive internet data from
Google Trends to discover daily rhythms in food-seeking behaviour. It is an interesting project
and not without merit but there is a fundamental problem with the reasoning.
Major criticisms:
My main critique is in the conclusions that the authors put forth. For example, the last sentence of
the abstract is: internet-based search terms patterns
reflect a biological rhythm of motivation for energy balance.
I don’t believe this has been demonstrated in the least. “That two peaks in the evening indicate
early and late chronotypes.” And “two well characterized human
chronotypes (Roenneberg et al., 2003).” This is simply incorrect. There are NOT two chronotypes
but rather there is a chronotype distribution with MOST of the people being moderate. (Begging
the question: do most of the people not use the internet when they get hungry?) Earlies and lates
are rare exceptions and adolescents are generally transiently late. Hence the difference in the two
cities with more or fewer students actually speaks FOR a cultural explanation and against a
biological one. So this quote is not well based “we propose the patterns are not culturally-
dependent and instead are biologically motivated.” The data from India is used to support this
but I see it as actually supporting a cultural component.
India has a distinctly different pattern with a major morning peak.
So if the authors still think their position is correct then show it with data and numbers. They say
“The appearance of daily rhythms across diverse cultures and countries supports the probability
for an underlying biological driver for ISB rhythmicity. This is emphasised by the consistent ISB
daily rhythms that exhibit a double evening spike in India (Fig. 2; Table S1, S2). There are slight
differences between India and the other countries, such as a higher level of mid-day ISB and
lower ‘evening’ ISB. Therefore, daily rhythms in food-related ISB cannot solely be accounted for
by Western cultures.” I think there are several issues in here which are getting mixed up. Try
unpacking them, it might make more sense. How slight is the India morning peak relative to all
others? What result would SUPPORT the notion that this is purely a cultural phenomenon?
Concerning the important point, are the search terms reflecting social or clock regulated
behaviour, none of the tests have been performed that would show clock regulation (e.g. within
time zone systematic changes reflecting natural photoperiod in cities that are below a certain
size). The lack of seasonal rhythms suggest that this is not regulated by the clock. Now we get
into complicated territory, where social customs may be so dominant as to mask circadian
regulation.
How does Fig. 2 show seasonal rhythms? They show daily rhythms with no seasonal data.
I suggest using CoG only to identify differences and then using phase markers such as peaks of
the 4harmonic fitted curves to describe search behaviour. I believe that more interesting
information would come out of this: comparing phases of the corresponding peaks between the
populations for the same query and within the same population for different queries. This
method would also be useful for looking at effects of light environment on ISB: is it different in
the eastern vs western side of a time zone?
3
Minor points:
The formulations of simple hypotheses at the end of the introduction that exactly fit the data
seems contrived. Especially since the prediction of exactly two chronotypes – early and late – is
incorrect.
p. 4 line 81 begin not begins
“These two weeks provided the capability to ensure the data were not confounded by
seasonal events.” This is not a correct (or immediately provable) assumption. Biological responses
to seasons as controlled by an annual clock are a continuum. That said, there is nothing wrong
with choosing these particular time points, which might be justified as time points which are
NOT characterised by – and thus not confounded by - extreme photoperiods. This conveniently
permits comparison of north and south hemisphere locations. It also should provide a point of
comparison: it is entirely possible, if an annual biological clock is involved in this process, that
fall and spring would show distinct patterns.
“daily waveforms did not vary across time zones” This is not immediately clear, please explain
from what analysis this stems (the average compared between different time zones or within time
zone analysis, from east to west?). This is relevant since chronotype varies across a time zone,
earlier in the east and later in the west, providing convincing data that chronotype in humans is
regulated by sun time.
“ISB driven evening meal times” Isn’t it more likely that meal times, insofar as they represent
biological demands/hunger, drive ISB?
“and reveals country specific timing of evening meals.” This is not explicitly shown. An internet
proxy for hunger is discussed but extending that assumption to meal time needs to be defended,
discussed, introduced, etc.
p. 8, line 177 “Outwith” is that a word?
Are all of these options open 24hrs a day? People can search for them, but they are likely not
open at 6AM in many cases, thus also refuting the assumption that the query represents
mealtime.
“two different cities were considered. Champaign-Urbana, IL, where the student population
encompasses 21.8% of the population was compared to Chicago IL, where the student population
makes up ~11% of the population (Florida, 2016). Observed pattern indicated that the
phenomenon is not purely explained by large populations of students, as same ISB rhythm was
present in both demographics.” The authors should show the data for this. Quite a statement
without data.
“Night Eating Syndrome (Harb 239 et al, 2012; Sato-Mito et al, 2011).”
What is the prevalence of NES? Perhaps the late peak is simply this group?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This is an interesting manuscript about food seeking behavior. The use of Google Trends to
obtain information is a new and interesting strategy in science.
My concerns regarding the study are related to the terms selection. It is not clear for me how the
authors selected these terms. The authors say "The food-associated search terms interrogated
included general terms (i.e. pizza delivery, chinese delivery) and region specific terms (i.e. Just
eat, panda express, swiggy, zomato and food panda)". As it can be seen, the authors do not list
neither the general terms or the specific terms. All the terms must be listed and the reason for
choosing pizza delivery or food panda, for instance, clearly explained. The readers want to see
the terms that did not show a rhythmic pattern as well (or all of them had the same pattern?).
Another issue is the conclusion regarding the picks at 19:00 and 02:00 h. In many countries (US
for example), most of the restaurants close at 02:00 h, and a person who had dinner at 19:00 h, as
the majority of the population, get more food when they come home from a party at 02:00 h
because the closing time of the restaurants. How do the authors know the users are not ordering
food twice on a specific day/occasion? Does google trends tell us when the search was done by
the same IP number? Please, include this discussion in the manuscript. I am not convinced that
the search at different picks reflects a morning and an evening type, considering 19:00 h is an
usual time for dinner in many places. Could you elaborate this a bit more?

The manuscript entitled “Appetitive information seeking behaviour reveals robust daily
rhythmicity for internet-based food-related key word searches” by Scrutton-Alvarado and
Stevenson reports the analysis of Google Trends data to investigate internet-based information-
searching behaviour for food-related terms to inform models of human foraging strategies. The
authors show stable patterns during the day that were further similar across different countries.
Search patterns across the year and the week, however, did not show a similar predictability.
I have reviewed the revised manuscript in relation to the reviewers' comments. My impression is
that while several comments were well addressed, not all responses were satisfying (e.g.,
reviewer 1, comment 4), and several of the follow-up analyses conducted remain inconclusive. In
several responses, the authors correctly acknowledged limitations of the current study and in the
interpretations that can be derived from the results. Unfortunately, however, in my view this also
shows that the results only make quite limited contributions to the literature and to explaining
human foraging behaviour. I have outlined this concern (and some other minor) concerns below:
1) My major concern is that this study does not reveal anything really novel. The authors
themselves admit that they can neither link the search patterns to consumption, nor to specific
foods, and they also cannot use the data to construct a novel foraging model, as it was the goal of
this study. This leaves the simple result that people google more for foods during the times they
usually eat, as expected. The origin of the other potentially interesting result, the late double-
peak, can also not be resolved and could indeed be the result of a multitude of factors (cultural,
biological, related to time, work shifts, and others), as the authors state themselves in the
manuscript (page 10-11). Unfortunately, this means, these results do not seem to explain much,
and they do not seem to provide any critical or impactful insights into human foraging
behaviours.
Minor
2) The two weeks chosen for the daily analyses, the 19th to 26th of September 2016 and the 14th to
the 20th 107 of March, seem quite arbitrary to me. I understand the (very short) given
explanation, but I don’t understand why not more samples from the 5-year period were taken to
obtain a more representative sample of the behaviour? It seems equally arbitrary to restrict the
analysis to one single search term (pizza delivery), as described on page 8 in the results?
Furthermore, from the figure it looks like a different model would fit these data better than a
linear one. I am wondering how much can actually be learned from these results.
3) The selection of search terms for each country is explained, but I can’t see any analyses
performed to obtain those. It would be beneficial to explain in more detail how this “initial
assessment of various key words” and of the “greatest usage by the population” was conducted.
This seems to be a missed opportunity here, as a wider range of more specific food-related search
terms could potentially have given more insights into different food groups (or factors such as
information vs consumption, etc.). Given that this is crucial for the validity of all analyses
performed in this study, the initial selection should be made more transparent, and details such
as number of search terms, cut-off values and the strategy for assessment should be outlined in
more detail.
4) The authors state that a P-value of 0.001 was used for statistical analyses (page 6). Given that
this threshold is rather unconventional, what was the motivation for this? Was this value always
11
corrected for multiple comparisons (as it seems from the respective section in the results), and
which analyses were considered relevant for the corrections?

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript entitled “Appetitive information seeking behaviour reveals robust daily
rhythmicity for internet-based food-related key word searches” by Scrutton-Alvarado and
Stevenson reports the analysis of Google Trends data to investigate internet-based information-
searching behaviour for food-related terms to inform models of human foraging strategies. The
authors show stable patterns during the day that were further similar across different countries.
Search patterns across the year and the week, however, did not show a similar predictability.
I have reviewed the revised manuscript in relation to the reviewers' comments. My impression is
that while several comments were well addressed, not all responses were satisfying (e.g.,
reviewer 1, comment 4), and several of the follow-up analyses conducted remain inconclusive. In
14
several responses, the authors correctly acknowledged limitations of the current study and in the
interpretations that can be derived from the results. Unfortunately, however, in my view this also
shows that the results only make quite limited contributions to the literature and to explaining
human foraging behaviour. I have outlined this concern (and some other minor) concerns below:
1) My major concern is that this study does not reveal anything really novel. The authors
themselves admit that they can neither link the search patterns to consumption, nor to specific
foods, and they also cannot use the data to construct a novel foraging model, as it was the goal of
this study. This leaves the simple result that people google more for foods during the times they
usually eat, as expected. The origin of the other potentially interesting result, the late double-
peak, can also not be resolved and could indeed be the result of a multitude of factors (cultural,
biological, related to time, work shifts, and others), as the authors state themselves in the
manuscript (page 10-11). Unfortunately, this means, these results do not seem to explain much,
and they do not seem to provide any critical or impactful insights into human foraging
behaviours.
Minor
2) The two weeks chosen for the daily analyses, the 19th to 26th of September 2016 and the 14th to
the 20th 107 of March, seem quite arbitrary to me. I understand the (very short) given
explanation, but I don’t understand why not more samples from the 5-year period were taken to
obtain a more representative sample of the behaviour? It seems equally arbitrary to restrict the
analysis to one single search term (pizza delivery), as described on page 8 in the results?
Furthermore, from the figure it looks like a different model would fit these data better than a
linear one. I am wondering how much can actually be learned from these results.
3) The selection of search terms for each country is explained, but I can’t see any analyses
performed to obtain those. It would be beneficial to explain in more detail how this “initial
assessment of various key words” and of the “greatest usage by the population” was conducted.
This seems to be a missed opportunity here, as a wider range of more specific food-related search
terms could potentially have given more insights into different food groups (or factors such as
information vs consumption, etc.). Given that this is crucial for the validity of all analyses
performed in this study, the initial selection should be made more transparent, and details such
as number of search terms, cut-off values and the strategy for assessment should be outlined in
more detail.
4) The authors state that a P-value of 0.001 was used for statistical analyses (page 6). Given that
this threshold is rather unconventional, what was the motivation for this? Was this value always
corrected for multiple comparisons (as it seems from the respective section in the results), and
which analyses were considered relevant for the corrections?

Appendix A
Response to Reviewer comments:
We thank the Editor and two reviewers for their time and constructive feedback. We have enumerated each
reviewer comment below, endeavoured to incorporate their comments and provided a detailed response. To
facilitate the identification of revisions in the manuscript, text changes are indicated in red font.
Reviewer: 1
Comment #1 - My main critique is in the conclusions that the authors put forth. For example, the
last sentence of the abstract is: internet-based search terms patterns reflect a biological rhythm of
motivation for energy balance. I don’t believe this has been demonstrated in the least. “That two
peaks in the evening indicate early and late chronotypes.” And “two well characterized human
chronotypes (Roenneberg et al., 2003).” This is simply incorrect. There are NOT two chronotypes
but rather there is a chronotype distribution with MOST of the people being moderate. (Begging the
question: do most of the people not use the internet when they get hungry?) Earlies and lates are
rare exceptions and adolescents are generally transiently late.
Response #1 – We agree with the Reviewer’s criticism. Our initial thought for the bi-modal peak
was due to an age-driven ISB, primarily secondary, college and university students. Our analyses
that compared Chicago versus Urbana-Champaign; an attempt to capture low versus high student
demographics (see new FigS6) did not yield a significant difference. The early versus late
conjecture was the result of applying the Occam’s razor philosophical principle. Upon further
reflection, it is likely that early and late chronotypes contribute to the bi-modal peaks, but in
agreement with the Reviewer, are a minority in the population captured by Google Trends data. We
have returned to our initial explanation that the evening ISB is driven by two populations that are
likely age-dependent. For example, adolescent to early career (e.g. 14-30) comprise the late
evening peak whereas individuals 30 and over may be responsible for the early peak.
Unfortunately, at this time, we cannot definitively determine the exact make-up for each
population. We have revised our abstract (lines 41-48) and conclusions (242-248; 251-258 and 262-
266) to include this alternative explanation.
Comment #2 - Hence the difference in the two cities with more or fewer students actually speaks
FOR a cultural explanation and against a biological one. So this quote is not well based “we
propose the patterns are not culturally-dependent and instead are biologically motivated.”
Response #2 – It appears that Reviewer did not correctly interpret the sentence and the findings.
There was no significant difference between the two cities (see new Fig S6). The support for the
biological explanation for ISB rhythms remains the strongest interpretation. The only difference
between Chicago and Urbana-Champaign was the frequency in ISB which reflects the amount of
ISB due to population size.
Comment #3 - The data from India is used to support this but I see it as actually supporting a
cultural component. India has a distinctly different pattern with a major morning peak. How slight
is the India morning peak relative to all others? What result would SUPPORT the notion that this is
purely a cultural phenomenon?
Response #3 – We have conducted a new analysis, created a new Figure and Table to address the
reviewer’s concern. Here, we focused on the phase peaks of 7h, 12h, 19h and 2h for country
specific terms (See Fig S4; Table S3). As expected, there are robust time-of-day and country
differences. However, there was no distinct pattern for India that was not present in other countries
(e.g. US). The result that would support the notion for a cultural phenomenon would be increased
ISB around major festivals such as Thanksgiving in Canada/United States; Christmas or Diwali, to
name a few. No change in ISB patterns was observed during these periods. We have added a
statement on lines 185-193 and 272-276 to emphasis the absence of a cultural ISB pattern.
Comment #4 - So if the authors still think their position is correct then show it with data and
numbers. They say “The appearance of daily rhythms across diverse cultures and countries supports
the probability for an underlying biological driver for ISB rhythmicity. This is emphasised by the
consistent ISB daily rhythms that exhibit a double evening spike in India (Fig. 2; Table S1, S4).
There are slight differences between India and the other countries, such as a higher level of mid-
day ISB and lower ‘evening’ ISB. Therefore, daily rhythms in food-related ISB cannot solely be
accounted for by Western cultures.” I think there are several issues in here which are getting mixed
up. Try unpacking them, it might make more sense.
Response #4 – The concern is not clear to us. The Reviewer has requested that we show the data;
but then references the data presented in the manuscript. The second concern to unpack mixed
concepts is also not clear to us. Given the additional data provided and our initial thoughts, the
statement is consistent with previous positions.
Comment #5 - Concerning the important point, are the search terms reflecting social or clock
regulated behaviour, none of the tests have been performed that would show clock regulation (e.g.
within time zone systematic changes reflecting natural photoperiod in cities that are below a certain
size). The lack of seasonal rhythms suggests that this is not regulated by the clock. Now we get into
complicated territory, where social customs may be so dominant as to mask circadian regulation.
Response #5 – Our analyses and discussion has been very careful to not include the
circadian/circannual clock mechanisms. The methods described in the paper can only assess
daily/seasonal rhythms in ISB; in order to examine the endogenous circadian/circannual clock
mechanisms would require a long-term, experimentally control (e.g. constant dim light/dark)
environments that permit humans to free-run. Our analyses of daily rhythms across time zones in
the United States (as described by the Reviewer) shows a consistent patterns which provide some
evidence that ISB is driven by internal timing mechanisms (Figure S3; Table S2). We have
provided a statement in the conclusions to address this comment. See lines 177-184 and 284-286.
Comment #6 - How does Fig. 2 show seasonal rhythms? They show daily rhythms with no seasonal
data.
Response #6 – The comment is not clear to us. Figure 2 does not show seasonal rhythms; but daily
rhythms as indicated by the reviewer. Fig S2 (now Fig. S5) presents the seasonal rhythms in ISB.
We examined the manuscript to confirm that all references of seasonal rhythms in ISB cite Fig. S3.
Comment #7 - I suggest using CoG only to identify differences and then using phase markers such
as peaks of the 4harmonic fitted curves to describe search behaviour.
Response #7 – We agree with the Reviewer. We have revised the text to state only the values for
the CoG of the various statistical analyses. See lines 156-157 and 162-167.
Comment #8 - I believe that more interesting information would come out of this: comparing
phases of the corresponding peaks between the populations for the same query and within the same
population for different queries. This method would also be useful for looking at effects of light
environment on ISB: is it different in the eastern vs western side of a time zone?
Response #8 – This is a good point and an analysis that we had conducted. The Google Trends data
to compare cities within a time zone was not sufficient for statistical analyses. However, data was
available to compare individual States within the Eastern
time zone for the United States. There was no clear shift in
phase peaks from an East to West direction (see adjacent
figure). There was significant overlap in the peak phase in
Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania and New York. Yet the
phase peaks do not show latitudinal alignment (i.e. New
York, Pennsylvania, Michigan then Indiana). These data
indicate that our current approach of using time zone
comparisons across the United States is the suitable
method for analyses.
Comment #9 - The formulations of simple hypotheses at the end of the introduction that exactly fit
the data seems contrived. Especially since the prediction of exactly two chronotypes – early and
late – is incorrect.
Response #9 – We agree with the reviewer’s perspective here. Our initial hypothesis (see lines 95-
96) was that Google Trends would show daily rhythms in appetitive behaviours. After collecting
the pilot-data, our hypothesis was refined to address the dual evening peaks. We have removed the
sentence and the introductory text only focuses on our original hypothesis.
Comment #10 - p. 4 line 81 begin not begins
Response #10 – The text has been revised.
Comment #11 - “These two weeks provided the capability to ensure the data were not confounded
by seasonal events.” This is not a correct (or immediately provable) assumption. Biological
responses to seasons as controlled by an annual clock are a continuum. That said, there is nothing
wrong with choosing these particular time points, which might be justified as time points which are
NOT characterised by – and thus not confounded by - extreme photoperiods. This conveniently
permits comparison of north and south hemisphere locations. It also should provide a point of
comparison: it is entirely possible, if an annual biological clock is involved in this process, that fall
and spring would show distinct patterns.
Response #11 – The Reviewer has correctly identified our oversight. We originally selected the
days surrounding the equinox so that the time points selected for daily rhythms were not
confounded by extreme photoperiods or a single phase of the year. We have revised the text and the
sentence now states ‘These two weeks provide the capability to reduce the potent of photoperiod
effects to confound daily rhythms and to permit the comparison of northern and southern
hemispheres’. See lines 108-110.
Comment #12 - “daily waveforms did not vary across time zones” This is not immediately clear,
please explain from what analysis this stems (the average compared between different time zones
or within time zone analysis, from east to west?). This is relevant since chronotype varies across a
time zone, earlier in the east and later in the west, providing convincing data that chronotype in
humans is regulated by sun time.
Response #12 – We agree with the Reviewer that it would be helpful to show ISB across the four
time zones. We have provided a new supplementary figure that shows morning, noon and two
evening phases for Eastern, Central, Mountain and Pacific time zones from the United States (See
Fig S3). The two-way ANOVA analysis on the means/variances of the Google Trends data for the
factors 1) time zones (i.e. Eastern, Central, Mountain and Pacific) and 2) phase peaks (morning,
noon, and early & late evening). We have revised the text on lines 177-187 to improve the clarity of
our analyses.
Comment #13 - “ISB driven evening meal times” Isn’t it more likely that meal times, insofar as
they represent biological demands/hunger, drive ISB? “and reveals country specific timing of
evening meals.” This is not explicitly shown. An internet proxy for hunger is discussed but
extending that assumption to meal time needs to be defended, discussed, introduced, etc.
Response #13 – The Reviewer has raised in an important distinction that should be clarified in the
manuscript. Appetitive behaviour captured by ISB; is entirely separate from meal times. There are
two concerns with the use of ‘meal times’ in the previous manuscript. First, there is no
confirmation that ISB would predict meal purchase, and thus an indirect measure of meal time.
This is also confounded that food delivery times vary. We had contacted a number of companies,
such as Just eats, with the goal to determine if there was a daily (and bi-modal evening) pattern of
purchases. Unfortunately, we did not receive a response to our queries. Secondly, there is no
confirmation that a single ISB resulted in a food-related purchase; there could have been a number
of ISB searches before a purchase was completed. Therefore, it is not appropriate to assume ‘meal
times or ‘timing of evening meals’. We have revised the manuscript (see lines: 134, 167-168, 181)
to eliminate the assumption that ISB is directly related with meal times.
Comment #14 - p. 8, line 177 “Outwith” is that a word?
Response #14 – Yes, the Oxford dictionary provides the following definition: ‘outside, or beyond’.
It is a common word used in Northern England and Scotland.
Comment #15 - Are all of these options open 24hrs a day? People can search for them, but they are
likely not open at 6AM in many cases, thus also refuting the assumption that the query represents
mealtime.
Response #15 – For the general search terms, there is no associated restaurant and therefore, these
terms are a reflection of the motivation (i.e. appetitive behaviour) to find food. Our analyses did not
examine the corresponding downstream consummatory behaviour (i.e. eating). For the specific
search terms (e.g. Just eats); these online resources have a number of restaurants/food outlets that
are ‘members’. When we assessed specific restaurants in the London, Aberdeen, Edinburgh and
Manchester databases, 8-22% are open late (i.e. past midnight); 51-70% will take orders for another
delivery time and 21-62% close by midnight. These data indicate that there is an online option
available 24hrs.
Comment #16 - “two different cities were considered. Champaign-Urbana, IL, where the student
population encompasses 21.8% of the population was compared to Chicago IL, where the student
population makes up ~11% of the population (Florida, 2016). Observed pattern indicated that the
phenomenon is not purely explained by large populations of students, as same ISB rhythm was
present in both demographics.” The authors should show the data for this. Quite a statement
without data.
Response #16 – The Reviewer has raised an important point. We plotted the data for both Chicago
and Urbana-Champaign in a new supplementary figure (see Fig.S6). The patterns for both cities
were observed to have significant overlap with lower early and late evening peaks which are likely
driven by the smaller population. There was no significant difference in ISB between Chicago and
Champaign-Urbana.
Comment #17 - “Night Eating Syndrome (Harb 239 et al, 2012; Sato-Mito et al, 2011).” What is
the prevalence of NES? Perhaps the late peak is simply this group?
Response #17 - NES has an average prevalence of 1.5-2.9% in general populations (Lundgren et
al., 2006; Runfola et al., 2014), factoring out other eating-disorders. Given the size of the peak, it is
unlikely they are the sole population inhabiting it. We have revised the text accordingly (See lines
250-258).
Reviewer: 2
Comment #1 - My concerns regarding the study are related to the terms selection. It is not clear for
me how the authors selected these terms. The authors say "The food-associated search terms
interrogated included general terms (i.e. pizza delivery, chinese delivery) and region specific terms
(i.e. Just eat, panda express, swiggy, zomato and food panda)". As it can be seen, the authors do not
list neither the general terms nor the specific terms. All the terms must be listed and the reason for
choosing pizza delivery or food panda, for instance, clearly explained.
Response #1 – We agree with the reviewer that a clear presentation of the rationale for the General
and Specific search terms should be provided. In order to address their concern, we have included a
new Supplementary Figure (i.e. Fig. S2; line 109) that illustrates Google Trends Interest for each
key word search. In the Figure Legend we state that ‘General terms were classified as those that
were observed across most countries and had relatively equal distribution of interest’. Furthermore,
we state that the Specific terms were drawn from the Google Trends ‘Related search terms’ after
he analyses of General terms. The new Fig. S2 lists all the terms and the reason for choosing are
isted in the Figure Legend.
Comment #2 - The readers want to see the terms that did not show a rhythmic pattern as well (or all
of them had the same pattern?).
Response #2 – The remarkable observation from our analyses was that all daily rhythms were
elatively the same across all countries and search terms. On the occasion the terms did not show a
hythmic pattern, this was due to low or non-existent data available in the Google trends database.
When the data were available, and did not show a rhythmic pattern, such as the lack of seasonal
hythms, the data were presented.
Comment #3 - Another issue is the conclusion regarding the picks at 19:00 and 02:00 h. In many
ountries (US for example), most of the restaurants close at 02:00 h, and a person who had dinner
t 19:00 h, as the majority of the population, get more food when they come home from a party at
02:00 h because the closing time of the restaurants.
Response #3 – We agree with the Reviewer concern that the same individuals could conduct the
ood searches for both the evening and midnight peaks (see line 239-240). Given that the pattern
occurs every day of the week; across all countries, we feel that this explanation is unlikely. Indeed
he ability to track whether the same individuals (or electronic devices) are used to perform the
Google searches would address this concern. At this time, we are unable to confirm or deny
whether the same individuals perform the searches at both times. In order to sufficiently
ccommodate this request would require, as one potential venture, an online survey that solicited
eedback from the wider-internet community. Prospective projects such as these would require
dditional resources and ethical permissions, and are beyond the scope of the current project.
Comment #4 - How do the authors know the users are not ordering food twice on a specific
day/occasion? Does google trends tell us when the search was done by the same IP number? Please,
nclude this discussion in the manuscript.
Response #4 – This concern is an extension of the comment above (Comment #3). Google Trends
operates purely on an anonymous basis, so acquisition of which IP searched when is not available.
We have elaborated on our previous discussion to support our position that the majority of the daily
data likely reflects different populations of individuals (See lines 241-248).
Comment #5 - I am not convinced that the search at different picks reflects a morning and an
vening type, considering 19:00 h is an usual time for dinner in many places. Could you elaborate
his a bit more?
Response #5 – We agree with the Reviewer concern here, and a similar point was raised by
Reviewer #1 above (see Comment #1). We have deliberated further on what could account for the
bi-modal peak in evening search rates and have come to the conclusion that our age-driven
hypothesis was limited to analyses of cities that could assess university/college aged populations.
This rather restricted view does not take into consideration adolescent aged, non-higher education
nd early professional age ranges. A more probable outcome is that the populations that driven the
bi-modal variation in Google searches include diverse aged groups and less likely human
hronotypes. We have revised our conjecture accordingly (see lines 250-266).
Appendix B
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
Comments #1: The authors have answered my comments in a satisfactory manner.
Response #1: We appreciate the Reviewers positive assessment.
Reviewer: 3
Comment #1: My major concern is that this study does not reveal anything really novel. The authors
themselves admit that they can neither link the search patterns to consumption, nor to specific
foods, and they also cannot use the data to construct a novel foraging model, as it was the goal of
this study. This leaves the simple result that people google more for foods during the times they
usually eat, as expected. The origin of the other potentially interesting result, the late double-peak,
can also not be resolved and could indeed be the result of a multitude of factors (cultural, biological,
related to time, work shifts, and others), as the authors state themselves in the manuscript (page 10-
11). Unfortunately, this means, these results do not seem to explain much, and they do not seem to
provide any critical or impactful insights into human foraging behaviours.
Response #1: We disagree with the Reviewer’s critic. Our paper does reveal a novel human
behaviour that has not been capture: the motivation to seek food. The patterns of information
seeking behaviour are exciting, can easily be measured/replicated and were identified across
countries. Furthermore, the methods described in the paper also provide a novel approach to
information seeking behaviour that can be extended to a range of human motivations.
These 2 key advancements, in our opinion provide impactful insights into human motivation. The
limitations outlined by the Reviewer, reflect our position described in the manuscript. The capability
to resolve all the limitations of the newly described appetitive behaviour are beyond the scope of
the current project and would require extra financial resources, and overcome some legal
boundaries (i.e. new EU privacy laws). To emphasize the importance of our methodological approach
and findings we have added a couple sentences in the Introduction (see lines 77-79) and Discussion
(222-223).
Comment #2: The two weeks chosen for the daily analyses, the 19th to 26th of September 2016 and
the 14th to the 20th 107 of March, seem quite arbitrary to me. I understand the (very short) given
explanation, but I don’t understand why not more samples from the 5-year period were taken to
obtain a more representative sample of the behaviour? It seems equally arbitrary to restrict the
analysis to one single search term (pizza delivery), as described on page 8 in the results?
Response #2: The dates, as stated in the manuscript, were chosen due to their locations within
seasonal timelines (see lines 109-111), as the fall and spring equinoxes. These dates were chosen to
reduce the impact of a potential confound from other annual photoperiods that show increasing or
decreasing changes in day length. Moreover, the 5-year period was defined by Google Trends and
was the maximum number of samples to incorporate a number of days for the daily rhythms
analyses. The Google Trends algorithm during these periods provides the necessary hourly data
required for robust daily rhythms.
Comment #3: Furthermore, from the figure it looks like a different model would fit these data better
than a linear one. I am wondering how much can actually be learned from these results.
Response #3: There are a number of potential statistical models that could have been selected. We
selected, and provided justification (lines 129-131) for the use of Circawave 1.4 as this software is
commonly used in our field of research (Oster et al., 2006; Adams, et al., 2013; Stevenson, 2017;
Lincoln et al., 2006) and provides an accurate method to examine rhythmic behaviour. The final
statement is not clearly conveyed within the context of the previous comment. The manuscript
provides a series of analyses; reflected in 6 figures that altogether provides novel and impactful
findings.
Comment #4: The selection of search terms for each country is explained, but I can’t see any
analyses performed to obtain those. It would be beneficial to explain in more detail how this “initial
assessment of various key words” and of the “greatest usage by the population” was conducted. This
seems to be a missed opportunity here, as a wider range of more specific food-related search terms
could potentially have given more insights into different food groups (or factors such as information
vs consumption, etc.). Given that this is crucial for the validity of all analyses performed in this study,
the initial selection should be made more transparent, and details such as number of search terms,
cut-off values and the strategy for assessment should be outlined in more detail.
Response #4: It appears the Reviewer is not familiar with Google Trends. The terms selected are
based on ‘related queries’ which is based on an algorithm designed by Google. The ‘Related queries’
were selected because they were the most popular search queries as defined by Google. This
approach to obtain specific search terms for subsequent analyses is common and used previously to
identify the most suitable search terms (Bakker, et al., 2016; Salathé et al., 2013). The methods
section provides sufficient detail for any researcher or the public to replicate data collection. We
have revised lines 111-113 to improve the clarity of the methods and rationale for key word
selection.
Comment #5: The authors state that a P-value of 0.001 was used for statistical analyses (page 6).
Given that this threshold is rather unconventional, what was the motivation for this? Was this value
always corrected for multiple comparisons (as it seems from the respective section in the results),
and which analyses were considered relevant for the corrections?
Response #5: The Reviewer’s comment is quite pedantic here. The use of statistical p-values, even
the P<0.05 is arbitrary. We selected P<0.001 to provide a conservative measure to assess the
significance of the rhythmic data. This value was corrected for multiple comparisons in determining
in two-way ANOVAs, such as those quantifying the effect of geographical region and time zones.
Bonferroni corrections are described for multiple comparisons; see lines 182-185.
