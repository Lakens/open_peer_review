My report is brief. On first reading this manuscript, I was dubious as to what its merits might be.
However, on a second reading (and a third reading), it seemed to be a reasonably acceptable
article – but not spectacular. The application to two data sets is somewhat interesting, though it
would have been nice to have more supporting evidence/justification for what was being
proposed.
On a separate issue, there are numerous typos and related edits that need to be made before any
final acceptance is made.

Authors demonstrated through real examples that gaps and distributional patterns embedded
withinreal-valued measurements are inseparable biological and mechanistic information contents
of thesystem. I have the following comments: Firstly, the review of related works is insufficient,
and only seven references are listed. Secondly, I cannot see the main contributions of this work.
Thirdly, Authors indicated that “It is surprising that a well-known Hierarchical clustering
algorithm, which was first developed in1950’s for taxonomy, can help resolve a complex
computational physical problem with exponentialgrowth of complexity.” How about other
clustering algorithm? In addition, all the symbols in the formulas should be clearly explained.
The English writing should be improved.

critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published.
All contributors who do not meet all of these criteria should be included in the
acknowledgements.
We suggest the following format:
AB carried out the molecular lab work, participated in data analysis, carried out sequence
alignments, participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript; CD carried out
the statistical analyses; EF collected field data; GH conceived of the study, designed the study,
coordinated the study and helped draft the manuscript. All authors gave final approval for
publication.
• Acknowledgements
Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship
criteria.
• Funding statement
Please list the source of funding for each author.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.
Yours sincerely,

omplexity of Possibly-gapped Histogram and Analysis of Histogram

e authors appreciate the two referees for their comments. Since their
mments are stated in general terms. Therefore we response to these
erees simultaneously.
e guiding principle underlying this paper is to make use of graphic
plays to reveal computed information contents contained in data. So that
ch graphic displays can easily and likely stimulate true understanding of
ch information. This is objective of this work.
this revised version, we add several important technical materials and a
w ANOHT on a divorce data.
1) Empirical process theory on complete data. We add this technical
subsection to make explicit the foundation of 2nd phase of ANOHT.
The variance-covariance structure for mimicking the matrix of
frequencies is shown to have rather simple structures. The explicit
form would make the ANOHT more precise. It also confirms that the
degrees of dependence between frequencies of different bins
pertaining to one treatment are relatively small.
2) Empirical process theory on right censored data. We add two
technical subsections for expanding the applicability of ANOHT to
right-censored data setting: a) one from survival function perspective;
b) one from cumulative hazard function perspective. We demonstrate
that the cumulative hazard perspective based on Nelson-Aalen
estimation would render simpler 2nd phase of ANOHT than that based
on Kaplan-Meier survival function. Nonetheless the Kaplan-Meier
survival function estimation is needed in the 1st phase of ANOHT.
3) A New ANOHT on divorce data: Two third of data points of this data
set are right censored. This key characteristics in general causes
severe bias issues in statistical inferences. However we show that
this heavy censoring rate doesn’t cause big problems for applying
ANOHT.
By adding these three subsections, we think that this paper has
become much more substantial than its previous version. And the
applicability of ANOHT is successfully extended to incomplete data
setting.
We have also invested a large amount of time and efforts to smooth
our writing, and correcting our English presentations. We hope that
the overall quality of this manuscript has been significantly improved.
The topics of this paper: possibly-gapped histogram and ANOHT,
likely turn out to be rather fundamental and important in data-driven
computing. We wish such computational techniques can be widely
used to advance our understanding in sciences and real world
business.
