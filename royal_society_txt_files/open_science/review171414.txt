1. Quantitative analysis of actual Pt/Pd atomic ratios (e.g., by ICP-OES) is strongly
recommended, especially for the catalyst with highest hydrogenation degree. This is critically
important since certain diffraction peaks related to Pd were not prominent in XRD patterns of
many samples (p.13, Fig. 5).
2. On p.13, Fig. 5, please plot standard Pd(JCPDS 46-1043) and Pt(JCPDS 04-0802) diffraction
patterns along with current XRD results. Without standard patterns plotted on the same scale as
current XRD results, it is difficult to assign peaks at 2 theta of 66.15~67.89 to Pt(220), without
ambiguity (see p.14, Lines 43-45). In fact, two types of diffraction peaks were observed in this 2
theta range, assignable to Pt(220) and Pd(220).
3. On p.14, Lines 43-45, peak at 2 theta of 45.98-46.66 should be assigned to Pd(200), instead of
Pd(220).
4. On p.9, Lines 24-26, IR peak at wavenumber 1602 was assigned to (C=O). Where was C=O
stretching vibration originated from? What part of structure of MAC or GnM contains carbonyl
groups?
5. On pp.8 and 32, Scheme 4, please correct, from 4mpa to 4MPa, and 600 rpm, instead of rpm600.

The research is useful and conclusions are well supported by data. It is a comprehensive study on
the synthesis, characterization and catalytic activity of Pd-Pt nanoparticles. I recommend

The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days (i.e. by the 04-Nov-2017). If you do not
think you will be able to meet this date please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
4
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Best wishes,
James Moore, Publishing Editor

Appendix A
2-Nov-2017
Dear Editors,
Thank you very much for your supervision of the reviewing process of our manuscript
We also highly appreciate the reviewers’ carefulness, conscientiousness, and the broad
knowledge on the relevant research fields, since he/she has given us a number of
beneficial suggestions. According to the reviewers’ criticisms and instructions, we have
made the following revisions.
1. The reviewer comments 1 suggested by reviewers <U+FE5F>1,
We have supplemented ICP-OES analysis for the actual atomic rations of the catalysts
with higher hydrogenation degree (G2M-(Pt3/Pd7) and G4M-(Pt3/Pd7) ) in Table 3
(see Page 14, Lines 1-11).
2. The reviewer comments 2 suggested by reviewers <U+FE5F>1,
As suggested by this reviewer comments 2, we have plotted the characteristic
diffraction peaks for Pd(JCPDS 46-1043) and Pt(JCPDS 04-0802) with the XRD results
of GnM-(Ptx/Pd10-x) in Fig 5 (see Page 10).
3. The reviewer comments 3 suggested by reviewers <U+FE5F>1,
We really appreciate it that the reviewer pointed out we typed Pd (220) wrongly, we
have typed Pd (200) correctly, instead of Pd (220) (see Page 11, Lines 19-21).
4. The reviewer comments 4 suggested by reviewers <U+FE5F>1,
The characteristic peak at 1602cm-1 should be assigned to (C=C) which was attributed
to double-bonds in the trilefinic macrocycle of MAC and GnM (see Page 6, Lines 11-
13).
5. The reviewer comments 5 suggested by reviewers <U+FE5F>1,
We have changed 4mpa and rpm600 into 4MPa and 600rpm respectively in Scheme 4
(see Page 5).
We hope that these revisions are satisfactory and then the revised version will be
acceptable for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Thank you very much for your work concerning our paper.
Wish you all the best!
Sincerely yours,
Zhijun Jin
