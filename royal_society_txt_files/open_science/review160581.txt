This paper documents a striking pattern of diversity in the distribution of turtles during the
Jurassic and Cretaceous when looked at in a global perspective that mirrors the extant pattern.
The pattern that is documented is well supported, but two questions came to mind that should be
more explicitly addressed to support the conclusion that this is a real reflection of the biological
pattern of the time. One is whether or not the pattern is a result of the pattern of exposure of the
fossil bearing formations, such that most are from mid-latitude regions. A contrast with the
distribution of crocodiles (lines 110 to 113) is presented as the evidence for this, and this seems to
be a good argument but should be presented a little more explicitly. For example, the statement
that the tropical peak for subsampled crocodilian genus richness in the Triassic is located in the
equatorial regions is not really relevant because the distribution of turtles in the Triassic is not
treated in the study. The statement that crocodiles show high diversity in low-palaeolatitude
formations during the Cretaceous is the critical one, and this could be backed up by a little more
data, for example saying what those latitudes are and what the levels of diversity are based on
data in the paper that is being referred to.
Along the same lines, another question that occurs to me is whether or not this is really a global
pattern or whether it is a North American pattern that appears global because the record in North
America, at least for the Late Cretaceous, is so good and has been so intensely studied. Not quite
sure how this could be addressed, but with the data the authors have, I am sure they will be able
to come up with something.
On a more pedantic note, it should be stated clearly that the latitudes given are paleolatitudes,
not current latitudes. This is specified in the supplementary material, but should be stated clearly
in the text. I noticed one place where the term paleolatitude was used, but generally just the
word latitude is used. Also, some comment as to how the paleolatitudes were estimated could be
added to the methods section.
Finally, the other question that came to mind was: What is happening in the southern
hemisphere? Is there no gradient, or is the peak in the tropical region? Or is there just not enough
data to say. A simple statement as to what the situation in the southern hemisphere is would
round out the paper nicely.

Dear authors,
This is a good paper that makes a useful and interesting contribution to our understanding of the
deep time latitudinal biodiversity gradient. I have made lots of (mostly) minor comments on an
annotated version of the PDF of the MS. Many of these are requests for a little more information,
but a couple pertain to aspects of the analyses and are expanded upon below:
(1) The Discussion switches between using the raw and subsampled diversity data to comment
upon certain patterns. Why are the "raw" results considered meaningful, especially as you were
able to produce subsampled diversity for those time intervals discussed? Partly related to this,
you make comparisons between observed diversity and several sampling proxies - do these
relationships remain after subsampling?
(2) It would be good to state that the analyses were carried out at the global scale, and perhaps
caveat the discussion with the possibility that regional (e.g. palaeocontinental) patterns might
deviate from a global signal. Is it possible to produce an LBG for any palaeocontinent for some of
your better sampled time slices (presumably most likely the Late Cretaceous ones)? It would be
good to know whether one region is driving the pattern, for example.
Best wishes,
Philip Mannion

Comments to the Author(s)

First, I commend the authors on a nicely detailed and thorough study investigating
biogeographical patterns for testudinates during the Mesozoic. This paper syncs nicely with more
extensive work in the Cenzoic and provides an excellent background and dataset for future, more
detailed, analysis of Mesozoic biogeographic patterns. The manuscript is exceptionally well
written, detailed, and to the authors’ great credit, succinct. Excellent job!
I recommend this manuscript for publication with only minor revisions. My suggested
revisions include three, basic, analyses, that will, I think, improve the scope of the manuscript
and allow for greater comparison to previously published works. Only one analysis may require
the collection of additional data (see below). In addition to these suggested analyses, I suggest
two citations that the authors may wish to review and cite in the manuscript, which would
provide more evidentiary support for their conclusions. Please see detailed comments below.
Note 1: I noted on the cover page to the manuscript that the lead author, Nicholson, David, has
their affiliation as: The Natural History Museum, Department of Earch Sciences. - This should be
Earth Sciences (as it is written on line 3 of the manuscript). - I suggest the author double check
this one, I am sure they wish to have their affiliation properly spelled!
Line 24: I note that there are superscript notes at the end of the sentence. I believe they
correspond to citations 1 and 2? I do not find a footnote correlated to these superscripts.
__
Lines 38-40: The authors write, “Moreover, prior studies of turtle distributions have not
determined whether this pattern has a deep-time origin or is a consequence of more recent
climatic and geographic factors.” - Here I strongly suggest the authors review the two following
citations:
Ihlow F, Dambach J, Engler JO, et al. 2012. On the brink of extinction? How climate change may
affect global chelonian species richness and distribution. Glob Change Biol 18:1520–1530.
Rödder D, Lawing AM, Flecks M, et al. 2013. Evaluating the significance of paleophylogeographic
species distribution models in reconstructing Quaternary range-shifts in Nearctic chelonians.
PLoS One 8:e72855.
In particular the Rödder et al. (2013) citation provides a simulation analysis in concert with fossil
occurrence data, specifically to investigate whether or not occupation of habitats and ranges of
extant testudinoid turtles reflects a historic or recent geographic pattern or both. - I concur with
the authors that there is a dearth of work on the specific nature of the global testudinate LBG as
whether or not it is historical or recent. However, the Rödder et al. work provides evidence that
at least in North America, where most of global diversity patterns seem to be derived, is a
reflection of both historic and recent climatic phenomena. In addition the Rödder et al. study
provides evidentiary support for the authors’ discussion (notably lines 88-90). Where it provides
evidence that again turtle distributions are dynamic and not static, even across short times.
5
Another compelling point, which should be discussed by the authors - Given the
acknowledgement of dynamic pattern shifts through short period of times, the relative stability of
a global LBG concentrated between 15-30º N latitude across the Mesozoic is quite interesting
overall. I suggest the authors place this in their discussion, analysis of this particular pattern is
outside the scope of this manuscript, but the authors’ results allow sufficiently some discussion
on this intriguing point.
__
Lines 90-92. The authors note that LBGs are not fixed and suggest that future LBGs may not
necessarily retain a tropical or sub-tropical peak. I agree, in principle, with the authors that LBGs
are non-static and the implicit statement that predicting future LBGs could be quite difficult. But I
disagree that we could not/should not expect turtle diversity to retain a tropical or sub-tropical
peak. At most we may see a peak move into warmer temperate zones. Beyond this however, we
should not expect a large movement of turtle range and diversity.
Here I suggest the authors review and cite the Ihlow et al. (2012) reference provided above. - My
justification in my criticism here is that we do know that despite occupying a large number of
ecological niches, turtles are still biologically limited in their distributions. While we do not fully
understand what those biological limits are, it is not difficult to recognize that factors such as
ectothermy (which the authors acknowledge on lines 107-109) and obligate ovipary will clearly
limit the range of turtles into colder climates. - I suggest the authors consider adding an
acknowledgement of the biological limitations of turtles to the end of this paragraph. A brief
statement, which could be supported by the Ihlow et al. citation and the citations within that
publication) should suffice. I do not feel that an extended discussion is necessary or warranted,
but do feel the authors sell short the predictive nature of the biology of the organism in question
here.
__
Lines 110-114. The authors discuss the contrast between Mesozoic and recent crocodylomorphs
and note the broader range of habitats with non-existent crocodylomorphs today. They cite
Markwick (2007) on paleoclimate proxies and suggest that there may have been different climatic
preferences between turtles and crocs in the past. - I suggest that the authors should be able to
investigate this hypothesis more thoroughly, by investigating the co-occurrence of turtle and croc
fossils and their inferred paleoenvironments.
To simplify this task, I would suggest the authors query their turtle fossil localities and
investigate if crocs are present in those localities. I recognize that this is a potentially time-
intensive investigation. However, I urge the authors to consider undertaking this investigation,
because it will significantly expand the scope of their study by allowing the ecological
environments to be more fully considered. And it will provide an excellent datapoint on the use
of crocs as ecological analogues for turtles - I do, however, recognize that these analyses may
move beyond the scope of this manuscript documenting patterns of LBGs for turtles in the
Mesozoic. So, I make this recommendation, but will leave it to the authors’ discretion to
determine if they wish to make this investigation.
Lines 119-126: The authors discuss the issue of sampling ancient watersheds and how this may
increase taxonomic sampling as well as explain a key component of their predictive model. I very
much like this discussion. It caused me to pause and consider and finally conclude that the
authors should absolutely include a comparison of taxonomic richness against aquatic and
terrestrial environments. - The authors find that non-marine area performs as a poor predictive
model for turtle LBGs. - Which is supported by a statement in their methods (lines 169-172) on
6
the nature of a dearth of terrestrial turtles in the Mesozoic. Here the authors’ statements go
unquantified, but could be quantified. It is not only worth noting, as the authors’ say, but it is
capable of being quantified, simply by cross-referencing the genus with its inferred ecological
habitat. If it is unknown, simply note the unknown. A comparison of ecotype and latitude
diversity would allow a direct comparison with Angielczyk et al. (Figure 3A). It would also
provide additional evidence to support the authors’ discussion on lines 119-126.
Lines 141-144: The authors final conclusion is that the modern turtle LBG may have been
established as far back as the Mesozoic. This is a compelling conclusion and one that is generally
supported by the authors’ results. However, the statement here caused me to consider and
request a final analysis. And that is an investigation of family-level diversity patterns through the
Mesozoic. Because a number of Mesozoic genera go extinct before the Cenozoic or in the early
Cenozoic, the suggestion that the modern turtle LBG was established in the Mesozoic, suggests
that the ecological niches for turtles, regardless of phylogeny, have been conserved for hundreds
of millions of years. A highly compelling point! - By conducting a family level comparison, the
authors would allow further light to be shed on this, by investigating the number of extant
families that may establish their patterns earlier or later (e.g., Trionychidae likely establishes its
patterns quite early based on other published research). This analysis will allow the authors to
investigate this particular point by addressing the question of phylogeny, without having to
construct or use a phylogenetic tree to do so. This will again allow the authors to expand the
impact of their work, by allowing a more direct comparison with published works on the
Cenozoic. I note that the authors’ datasets already include family-level headings, so this should
be a simple analysis to provide.
___
Final comments: The family-level and terrestrial-aquatic comparisons will provide more evidence
for the authors’ conclusions. In addition they will allow greater comparison with already
published works. And should definitely be undertaken and included prior to publication.
I urge the authors to read and cite Ihlow et al. (2012) and Rödder et al. (2013) as both
publications provide support for their discussion.
I suggest that the authors further investigate the crocs-as-turtle-ecological-proxies hypothesis by
investigating co-occurrence of turtles and crocs and the inferred paleoenvironments of those
localities where co-occurrences occur. This will increase the robustness of their model and
provide a new potential tool for investigating past/present turtle biogeography and factors
controlling biogeographic distributions. But I recognize that this may move beyond the scope of
this manuscript and leave this to the authors’ discretion. - Although, I do advise the authors,
should they choose not to undertake this analysis at the present, to provide a sentence
acknowledging how they would test this hypothesis. As a general rule, I prefer when authors not
only provide a hypothesis but provide at least one potential way of testing it. This always
provide more scientific fruit for readers.
I am happy to sign my name to this review and encourage the authors to contact me with
questions or clarifications, through the editor. I look forward to the final version of this excellent
work.

Lines 38-40: The authors write, “Moreover, prior studies of turtle distributions have not
determined whether this pattern has a deep-time origin or is a consequence of more recent
climatic and geographic factors.” - Here I strongly suggest the authors review the two following

In particular the Rödder et al. (2013) citation provides a simulation analysis in concert with fossil
occurrence data, specifically to investigate whether or not occupation of habitats and ranges of

provide additional evidence to support the authors’ discussion on lines 119-126.
Lines 141-144: The authors final conclusion is that the modern turtle LBG may have been
established as far back as the Mesozoic. This is a compelling conclusion and one that is generally
supported by the authors’ results. However, the statement here caused me to consider and
request a final analysis. And that is an investigation of family-level diversity patterns through the
Mesozoic. Because a number of Mesozoic genera go extinct before the Cenozoic or in the early
Cenozoic, the suggestion that the modern turtle LBG was established in the Mesozoic, suggests
13
that the ecological niches for turtles, regardless of phylogeny, have been conserved for hundreds
of millions of years. A highly compelling point! - By conducting a family level comparison, the
authors would allow further light to be shed on this, by investigating the number of extant
families that may establish their patterns earlier or later (e.g., Trionychidae likely establishes its
patterns quite early based on other published research). This analysis will allow the authors to
investigate this particular point by addressing the question of phylogeny, without having to
construct or use a phylogenetic tree to do so. This will again allow the authors to expand the
impact of their work, by allowing a more direct comparison with published works on the
Cenozoic. I note that the authors’ datasets already include family-level headings, so this should
be a simple analysis to provide.
___
Final comments: The family-level and terrestrial-aquatic comparisons will provide more evidence
for the authors’ conclusions. In addition they will allow greater comparison with already
published works. And should definitely be undertaken and included prior to publication.
I urge the authors to read and cite Ihlow et al. (2012) and Rödder et al. (2013) as both
publications provide support for their discussion.
I suggest that the authors further investigate the crocs-as-turtle-ecological-proxies hypothesis by
investigating co-occurrence of turtles and crocs and the inferred paleoenvironments of those
localities where co-occurrences occur. This will increase the robustness of their model and
provide a new potential tool for investigating past/present turtle biogeography and factors
controlling biogeographic distributions. But I recognize that this may move beyond the scope of
this manuscript and leave this to the authors’ discretion. - Although, I do advise the authors,
should they choose not to undertake this analysis at the present, to provide a sentence
acknowledging how they would test this hypothesis. As a general rule, I prefer when authors not
only provide a hypothesis but provide at least one potential way of testing it. This always
provide more scientific fruit for readers.
I am happy to sign my name to this review and encourage the authors to contact me with
questions or clarifications, through the editor. I look forward to the final version of this excellent
work.

Appendix A
Response to Reviewers
We would like to thank all three reviewers for their thoughtful and helpful comments on
our manuscript. We have been able to implement many of the reviewer’s suggestions and
feel that the manuscript is greatly improved as a result. Below, we detail the actions taken
and also justify those instances we have opted not to follow the reviewer’s
recommendations.
Please note that line numbers between the original and revised submissions are greatly
different due to a reordering of the sections suggested by Reviewer 2 (Phil Mannion).
Reviewer 1 (Don Brinkman)
“This paper documents a striking pattern of diversity in the distribution of turtles during the
Jurassic and Cretaceous when looked at in a global perspective that mirrors the extant
pattern. The pattern that is documented is well supported, but two questions came to mind
that should be more explicitly addressed to support the conclusion that this is a real
reflection of the biological pattern of the time. One is whether or not the pattern is a result
of the pattern of exposure of the fossil bearing formations, such that most are from mid-
latitude regions.”
Uneven sampling across space is an analogous problem to uneven sampling through time
and is why we conducted a subsampling analysis on the raw data for our investigation of
the latitudinal gradient. For the regression models, inclusion of turtle-bearing formations
was to explicitly test the association of the raw record and sampled (and therefore
presumably exposed) formations, which is indeed a strong explanatory factor in the fossil
record, as noted in our results and discussion sections. Consequently, we feel our choice of
methods and our reporting of these results already provides the information needed to
assess the problems highlighted by the reviewer.
“A contrast with the distribution of crocodiles (lines 110 to 113) is presented as the
evidence for this, and this seems to be a good argument but should be presented a little
more explicitly. For example, the statement that the tropical peak for subsampled
crocodilian genus richness in the Triassic is located in the equatorial regions is not really
relevant because the distribution of turtles in the Triassic is not treated in the study. The
statement that crocodiles show high diversity in low-palaeolatitude formations during the
Cretaceous is the critical one, and this could be backed up by a little more data, for example
saying what those latitudes are and what the levels of diversity are based on data in the
paper that is being referred to.”
We do present Triassic data in Figure 1 but, as the record of turtles is so sparse at that time,
we do not discuss it extensively. Discussion of the pseudosuchian results for the Triassic is
included for completeness, but was not intended to highlight any particularly significant
pattern. We feel that a citation to the paper is sufficient without reviewing and repeating
the details of the dataset on which it is based, as testing the crocodilian pattern lies beyond
the scope of our own work. We do, however, fully agree with the reviewer that the
comparison of turtle and crocodilian fossil biogeography warrants a fuller investigation and
we intend to explore this in a future planned publication dealing with reptile species
richness in the Palaeogene, when freshwater crocodilian occurrences are more abundant.
“Along the same lines, another question that occurs to me is whether or not this is really a
global pattern or whether it is a North American pattern that appears global because the
record in North America, at least for the Late Cretaceous, is so good and has been so
intensely studied. Not quite sure how this could be addressed, but with the data the
authors have, I am sure they will be able to come up with something.”
This is a valid concern, also picked up by Reviewer 2. Although North America is more
intensively sampled than most other areas (as seen by the number of occurrences plotted
in Figure 1a), the Eastern Hemisphere is also well sampled and contributes a greater
number of genera to the dataset for the Cretaceous, Jurassic and Triassic than the Western
Hemisphere, so by definition the global signal cannot be driven solely by North American
data. We have added a statement to this effect with the relevant numbers of genera per
hemisphere in lines 177–192. Although a numerical analysis of this issue might be
warranted at some stage, the available data are already relatively finely divided by latitude
(as far as vertebrate fossil datasets go) and further subdividing it by continental areas
would reduce the number of bins available for subsampling and thus prevent rigorous
analysis of this pattern. This test will have to await the accumulation of significant amounts
of new data from ongoing and future fieldwork.
“On a more pedantic note, it should be stated clearly that the latitudes given are
paleolatitudes, not current latitudes. This is specified in the supplementary material, but
should be stated clearly in the text. I noticed one place where the term paleolatitude was
used, but generally just the word latitude is used. Also, some comment as to how the
paleolatitudes were estimated could be added to the methods section.”
This is a helpful suggestion, which improves the clarity of the manuscript, and changes have
been made accordingly. We now include a statement on the source of these palaeolatitude
estimates on lines 70–72.
“Finally, the other question that came to mind was: What is happening in the southern
hemisphere? Is there no gradient, or is the peak in the tropical region? Or is there just not
enough data to say. A simple statement as to what the situation in the southern
hemisphere is would round out the paper nicely.”
Although the data is much sparser from the southern hemisphere, which leads to
difficulties in interpreting the subsampled data for these areas, a new paper by Waterson et
al. (2016), which was published after our initial submission, indicates, using climatic niche
modeling, that the Southern Hemisphere contained very little suitable habitat for non-
marine turtles at least in the Maastrichtian and so may explain the paucity of fossils found
there. General Circulation Models of Mesozoic climate also confirm this observation and
these two factors may be significant in genuinely suppressing turtle richness in Gondwana.
We now include a statement on this in lines 186–192.
Reviewer 2 (Philip Mannion)
“This is a good paper that makes a useful and interesting contribution to our understanding
of the deep time latitudinal biodiversity gradient. I have made lots of (mostly) minor
comments on an annotated version of the PDF of the MS. Many of these are requests for a
little more information, but a couple pertain to aspects of the analyses and are expanded
upon below:”
The minor comments in the PDF were very helpful in enhancing the clarity of our
arguments and we have incorporated all of these suggestions throughout the manuscript.
“(1) The Discussion switches between using the raw and subsampled diversity data to
comment upon certain patterns. Why are the "raw" results considered meaningful,
especially as you were able to produce subsampled diversity for those time intervals
discussed? Partly related to this, you make comparisons between observed diversity and
several sampling proxies - do these relationships remain after subsampling?”
We provide a comparison of both raw and subsampled results in part to give the reader a
fuller account of the data, but have now adjusted the text to provide greater emphasis to
discussion of the subsampled results (lines 158–162).
We expect that some relationship might be preserved between subsampled richness and
the sampling proxies as the shapes of the curves are not substantially altered by
subsampling. However, subsampling vertebrate datasets inevitably leads to the loss of
some bins from the series, and we would not have enough bins to repeat the GLS analyses
on them.
“(2) It would be good to state that the analyses were carried out at the global scale, and
perhaps caveat the discussion with the possibility that regional (e.g. palaeocontinental)
patterns might deviate from a global signal. Is it possible to produce an LBG for any
palaeocontinent for some of your better sampled time slices (presumably most likely the
Late Cretaceous ones)? It would be good to know whether one region is driving the pattern,
for example.”
This is a valid concern, also noted by Reviewer 1. Although North America is more
intensively sampled than most other areas (as seen by the number of occurrences plotted
in Figure 1a), the Eastern Hemisphere is also well sampled and actually contributes a
greater number of genera to the dataset for the Cretaceous, Jurassic and Triassic than the
Western Hemisphere, so no global signal can be driven solely by North America. We have
added this statement to the MS with the relevant numbers of genera per hemisphere in
lines 177–192. The dataset is already relatively finely divided by latitude (as far as
vertebrate fossil datasets go) and further subdividing it by continental areas would remove
too many bins from the subsampling results to recover any meaningful pattern.
Reviewer 3 (Robert Burroughs)
“First, I commend the authors on a nicely detailed and thorough study investigating
biogeographical patterns for testudinates during the Mesozoic. This paper syncs nicely with
more extensive work in the Cenzoic and provides an excellent background and dataset for
future, more detailed, analysis of Mesozoic biogeographic patterns. The manuscript is
exceptionally well written, detailed, and to the authors’ great credit, succinct. Excellent
job!”
Thank you.
“ I recommend this manuscript for publication with only minor revisions. My suggested
revisions include three, basic, analyses, that will, I think, improve the scope of the
manuscript and allow for greater comparison to previously published works. Only one
analysis may require the collection of additional data (see below). In addition to these
suggested analyses, I suggest two citations that the authors may wish to review and cite in
the manuscript, which would provide more evidentiary support for their conclusions. Please
see detailed comments below.
Note 1: I noted on the cover page to the manuscript that the lead author, Nicholson, David,
has their affiliation as: The Natural History Museum, Department of Earch Sciences. - This
should be Earth Sciences (as it is written on line 3 of the manuscript). - I suggest the author
double check this one, I am sure they wish to have their affiliation properly spelled!”
Thank you, corrected.
“Line 24: I note that there are superscript notes at the end of the sentence. I believe they
correspond to citations 1 and 2? I do not find a footnote correlated to these superscripts.”
Thank you, corrected.
“Lines 38-40: The authors write, “Moreover, prior studies of turtle distributions have not
determined whether this pattern has a deep-time origin or is a consequence of more recent
climatic and geographic factors.” - Here I strongly suggest the authors review the two
following citations:
21
Ihlow F, Dambach J, Engler JO, et al. 2012. On the brink of extinction? How climate change
may affect global chelonian species richness and distribution. Glob Change Biol 18:1520–
1530.
Rödder D, Lawing AM, Flecks M, et al. 2013. Evaluating the significance of
paleophylogeographic species distribution models in reconstructing Quaternary range-
shifts in Nearctic chelonians. PLoS One 8:e72855.
In particular the Rödder et al. (2013) citation provides a simulation analysis in concert with
fossil occurrence data, specifically to investigate whether or not occupation of habitats and
ranges of extant testudinoid turtles reflects a historic or recent geographic pattern or both.
- I concur with the authors that there is a dearth of work on the specific nature of the global
testudinate LBG as whether or not it is historical or recent. However, the Rödder et al. work
provides evidence that at least in North America, where most of global diversity patterns
seem to be derived, is a reflection of both historic and recent climatic phenomena. In
addition the Rödder et al. study provides evidentiary support for the authors’ discussion
(notably lines 88-90). Where it provides evidence that again turtle distributions are dynamic
and not static, even across short times.”
Thank you for making us aware of these papers. We now cite these works at lines 167
(Ihlow et al.) and at several other points in the manuscript (Rödder et al. lines 57, 154–176
and 242). They both add support to our contention that climate has had a major effect in
controlling the turtle LBG historically.
“Another compelling point, which should be discussed by the authors - Given the
acknowledgement of dynamic pattern shifts through short period of times, the relative
stability of a global LBG concentrated between 15-30º N latitude across the Mesozoic is
quite interesting overall. I suggest the authors place this in their discussion, analysis of this
particular pattern is outside the scope of this manuscript, but the authors’ results allow
sufficiently some discussion on this intriguing point.”
A brief discussion of the contrast between deep time stability and more-recent short-term
fluctuations has been added at lines 170–176.
“Lines 90-92. The authors note that LBGs are not fixed and suggest that future LBGs may
not necessarily retain a tropical or sub-tropical peak. I agree, in principle, with the authors
that LBGs are non-static and the implicit statement that predicting future LBGs could be
quite difficult. But I disagree that we could not/should not expect turtle diversity to retain a
tropical or sub-tropical peak. At most we may see a peak move into warmer temperate
zones. Beyond this however, we should not expect a large movement of turtle range and
diversity.”
We feel that our use of “necessarily” adequately captures the inherent uncertainty of
predicting future distributions (whether there are large movements or not), while any more
in-depth discussion of this point is best left to papers dealing explicitly with species
distribution modelling.
“Here I suggest the authors review and cite the Ihlow et al. (2012) reference provided
above. - My justification in my criticism here is that we do know that despite occupying a
large number of ecological niches, turtles are still biologically limited in their distributions.
While we do not fully understand what those biological limits are, it is not difficult to
recognize that factors such as ectothermy (which the authors acknowledge on lines 107-
109) and obligate ovipary will clearly limit the range of turtles into colder climates. - I
suggest the authors consider adding an acknowledgement of the biological limitations of
turtles to the end of this paragraph. A brief statement, which could be supported by the
Ihlow et al. citation and the citations within that publication) should suffice. I do not feel
that an extended discussion is necessary or warranted, but do feel the authors sell short
the predictive nature of the biology of the organism in question here.”
We have extended the sentence in question to include mention of the biological
limitations, citing Ihlow et al. (lines 164–167).
“Lines 110-114. The authors discuss the contrast between Mesozoic and recent
crocodylomorphs and note the broader range of habitats with non-existent
crocodylomorphs today. They cite Markwick (2007) on paleoclimate proxies and suggest
that there may have been different climatic preferences between turtles and crocs in the
past. - I suggest that the authors should be able to investigate this hypothesis more
thoroughly, by investigating the co-occurrence of turtle and croc fossils and their inferred
paleoenvironments.
To simplify this task, I would suggest the authors query their turtle fossil localities and
investigate if crocs are present in those localities. I recognize that this is a potentially time-
intensive investigation. However, I urge the authors to consider undertaking this
investigation, because it will significantly expand the scope of their study by allowing the
ecological environments to be more fully considered. And it will provide an excellent
datapoint on the use of crocs as ecological analogues for turtles - I do, however, recognize
that these analyses may move beyond the scope of this manuscript documenting patterns
of LBGs for turtles in the Mesozoic. So, I make this recommendation, but will leave it to the
authors’ discretion to determine if they wish to make this investigation.”
We agree that this would be a useful and enlightening investigation but also feel that it falls
outside the scope of this paper. Furthermore, we did not collate or vet the crocodylomorph
data, so this would ideally be a subject for collaboration with those who did at a later date.
“Lines 119-126: The authors discuss the issue of sampling ancient watersheds and how this
may increase taxonomic sampling as well as explain a key component of their predictive
model. I very much like this discussion. It caused me to pause and consider and finally
conclude that the authors should absolutely include a comparison of taxonomic richness
against aquatic and terrestrial environments. - The authors find that non-marine area
performs as a poor predictive model for turtle LBGs. - Which is supported by a statement in
their methods (lines 169-172) on the nature of a dearth of terrestrial turtles in the
Mesozoic. Here the authors’ statements go unquantified, but could be quantified. It is not
only worth noting, as the authors’ say, but it is capable of being quantified, simply by cross-
referencing the genus with its inferred ecological habitat. If it is unknown, simply note the
unknown. A comparison of ecotype and latitude diversity would allow a direct comparison
with Angielczyk et al. (Figure 3A). It would also provide additional evidence to support the
authors’ discussion on lines 119-126.”
There is limited and equivocal ecological data for many Triassic and Jurassic turtles; in the
Cretaceous where the lineages are better known, these data have been quantified in
Waterson et al. (2016), which was published after the original submission of this
manuscript, and which we now cite in the text. Unfortunately, however, too many taxa are
ecologically equivocal to make this a worthwhile effort for the entire Mesozoic at this time.
“Lines 141-144: The authors final conclusion is that the modern turtle LBG may have been
established as far back as the Mesozoic. This is a compelling conclusion and one that is
generally supported by the authors’ results. However, the statement here caused me to
consider and request a final analysis. And that is an investigation of family-level diversity
patterns through the Mesozoic. Because a number of Mesozoic genera go extinct before
the Cenozoic or in the early Cenozoic, the suggestion that the modern turtle LBG was
established in the Mesozoic, suggests that the ecological niches for turtles, regardless of
phylogeny, have been conserved for hundreds of millions of years. A highly compelling
point! - By conducting a family level comparison, the authors would allow further light to be
shed on this, by investigating the number of extant families that may establish their
patterns earlier or later (e.g., Trionychidae likely establishes its patterns quite early based
on other published research). This analysis will allow the authors to investigate this
particular point by addressing the question of phylogeny, without having to construct or
use a phylogenetic tree to do so. This will again allow the authors to expand the impact of
their work, by allowing a more direct comparison with published works on the Cenozoic. I
note that the authors’ datasets already include family-level headings, so this should be a
simple analysis to provide.
Final comments: The family-level and terrestrial-aquatic comparisons will provide more
evidence for the authors’ conclusions. In addition they will allow greater comparison with
already published works. And should definitely be undertaken and included prior to
publication.”
We concur that a family level or other nested hierarchical analysis of Mesozoic turtles
would probably demonstrate interesting patterns. Unfortunately, the phylogeny of these
early turtles is not yet sufficiently stable to allow analyses that more fully incorporate
phylogeny and there is no consensus phylogeny. We feel our approach, which relies upon
recognizing the morphotypes represented by genera, is the more intellectually defensible
at this time. A recently published ecological analysis for the richest part of the Mesozoic
record (Waterson et al. 2016) and cited.
“I urge the authors to read and cite Ihlow et al. (2012) and Rödder et al. (2013) as both
publications provide support for their discussion.
I suggest that the authors further investigate the crocs-as-turtle-ecological-proxies
hypothesis by investigating co-occurrence of turtles and crocs and the inferred
paleoenvironments of those localities where co-occurrences occur. This will increase the
robustness of their model and provide a new potential tool for investigating past/present
turtle biogeography and factors controlling biogeographic distributions. But I recognize that
this may move beyond the scope of this manuscript and leave this to the authors’
discretion. - Although, I do advise the authors, should they choose not to undertake this
analysis at the present, to provide a sentence acknowledging how they would test this
hypothesis. As a general rule, I prefer when authors not only provide a hypothesis but
provide at least one potential way of testing it. This always provide more scientific fruit for
readers.”
As mentioned above, we now include reference to Ihlow et al. (2012) and Rödder et al.
(2013). The crocs-as-turtle-ecological-proxies work is best deferred to a future,
collaborative paper with the compilers of those data.
