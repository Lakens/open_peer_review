The manuscript by Fu et al., deals with the The decomposition of toxic flotation reagents upon
UV185+254nm irradiation was attractive due to operational simplicity and no dosage of oxidants.
In this work, the degradation of typical thiol collectors (potassium ethyl xanthate (PEX), sodium
diethyl dithiocarbamate (SDD), O-isopropyl-N-ethyl thionocarbamate (IET) and dianilino
dithiophoshoric acid (DDA)) was investigated by the UV185+254nm photolysis. The degradation
efficiencies and mineralization extents of collectors were assessed. The formation of CS2 and H2S
byproducts was studied, and the mechanisms of collector degradation were proposed under
UV185+254nm irradiation. The PEX, SDD and IET were decomposed with nearly 100% removal
upon 75 min of UV185+254nm irradiation.The decomposition rate constants decreased in the
order SDD>PEX>IET>>DDA, and the DDA was the refractory collector. After 120 min of
UV185+254nm irradiation, 15<U+2012>45% of carbon and 25<U+2012>75% of sulfur of collectors were completely
mineralized, and the mineralization extent decreased in the order PEX>SDD>IET>DDA. The
percentage of gaseous sulfur (CS2 and H2S) was ranged from 0.48% to 4.85% for four collectors,
showing the fraction of emitted sulfur byproducts was small. The aqueous CS2 concentration
increased in first 10<U+2012>20 min, and was decreased to a low level of 0.05<U+2012>0.1 mg/L at 120 min. Two
mechanisms i.e., direct UV254nm photolysis and indirect oxidation with free radicals, were
responsible for collector decomposition in the UV185+254nm photolysis. Overall, the manuscript
is written in a good way, but i have ceretain suggestions/comments.

Manuscript: RSOS-190123
Dear editor,
The manuscript evaluated the decomposition of toxic flotation reagents upon UV185+254nm
irradiation and present some interesting results. Nevertheless, the results need to be better
discussed. Some highlights that need improvement are:
Equations 8 and 11 need references.
How was the t1/2 calculated?
The authors should standardize the nomenclature. Sometimes it is written UV185+254nm and
sometimes VUV.
Why were the times of 25 and 75 min chosen to be highlighted in table 2?
The authors mention many times that the molecular structure of the collectors are different, so
why was the effect of initial pH evaluated only for PEX and DDA?
Figure 4 should be changed to C/C0, so it would be easier to visualize the discussed results. The
way it is presented, it is hard to compare them because of the scale of the four graphs.
The authors should take care of the scales in all graphs.
The experiments presented in Figure 4 were performed in which pH?
The authors could add equations regarding the possible reaction of mineralization for the four
collectors. By adding this, it is easier to understand why using sulfate ions as an indicator of
mineralization.
Experimental conditions should be added in figure’s captions.

It is necessary to investigate new methods to remove chemicals from the floatation wastewater.
Authors used UV254+185nm method to degrade a series of flotation chemicals, the
mineralization, the by-products were well investigated, and the manuscript was well written.
Thus, I think it can be accepted.

This paper in detail describes photolytic degradation of toxic flotation reagents. It deals with
determining optimal conditions for the degradation, mechanism of degradation and monitoring
certain degradation products. Gaseous byproducts were quantitatively determined which to the
present knowledge there is no available work in the literature. This detailed approach to the
solution of the environmental issue represents valuable information and therefore after minor

Comment 2. did the authors have studied any toxicity of the sulfur degardation by products?.
Response: At the current stage, we do not evaluate the toxicity of the sulfur degradation
byproducts. Some toxic byproducts such as CS2 may appear in the degradation of thiol collectors.
So in the next work, we should investigate the acute and chronic toxicities of byproducts by using
the ecological structure-activity relationship (ECOSAR) program.
Comment 3. How the authors are sure about the formation of OH (hydroxyl radicals) during the
process. ?. Any ESR, EPR spectra??.
Response: In the previous work, H. Jablonowski et al. [26] have proved the formation of OH•
radicals and superoxide anion (O2•<U+2012>) in the VUV irradiation of water by the EPR spectroscopy.
Thus, in the Line 106, the sentence “The formation of OH• radicals and superoxide anion (O2•<U+2012>) in
the VUV irradiation of water have been proved by the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
spectroscopy”.

Comments to the Author(s)
Manuscript: RSOS-190123
Dear editor,
The manuscript evaluated the decomposition of toxic flotation reagents upon UV185+254nm
irradiation and present some interesting results. Nevertheless, the results need to be better
discussed. Some highlights that need improvement are:
Comment 1. Equations 8 and 11 need references.
Response: The reference [31] has been cited for Equations 8. But the Equations 8 is defined by
the authors for the first time to describe “the percentage of gaseous sulfur” in the degradation of
thiol collectors.
[31] Fu PF, Lin XF, Li G, Chen ZH, Peng H. 2018 Degradation of thiol collectors using ozone at a
low dosage: Kinetics, mineralization, ozone utilization, and changes of biodegradability and water
quality parameters. Minerals, 8, 477. (doi:10.3390/min8110477)
Comment 2. How was the t1/2 calculated?
Response: the pseudo-first-order kinetic equation is shown as Equation (1)
Ct
ln <U+F03D> <U+F02D>k <U+F0B4> t (1)
C0
where, C0 and Ct (mg/L) are the collector concentration at initial and time t, k (min-1) is the
pseudo-first-order rate constant, and t (min) is degradation time. The half life (t1/2) is defined as
the degradation time that the Ct has been reduced to the value of 1/2C0. Thus, the half life (t1/2) can
be calculated by Equation (2)
1
t1/2 <U+F03D> <U+F02D>k <U+F0B4> ln (2)
2
So, the half life (t1/2) can be calculated from the pseudo-first-order rate constant k according to
Equation (2).
Comment 3. The authors should standardize the nomenclature. Sometimes it is written
UV185+254nm and sometimes VUV.
Response: In Table 2, the “VUV” is revised to “UV185+254nm”.
In line 260, the “VUV” is revised to “UV185+254nm”.
In some cases, the “185nm VUV” is used to replace “VUV” to differentiate VUV and UV185+254nm.
Comment 4. Why were the times of 20 and 75 min chosen to be highlighted in table 2?
Response: As shown in Figure 2, the Ct/C0 values for PEX, SDD and IET at 120 min are almost
close to 100%. But at 20 and 75 min, the Ct/C0 values for these collectors are quite different. So
the degradation time of 20 and 75 min is chosen to compare the removal efficiency of four
collectors with high distinguish degree.
Comment 5. The authors mention many times that the molecular structure of the collectors are
different, so 6. why was the effect of initial pH evaluated only for PEX and DDA?
Response: As discussed in section 3.1, it can been seen that under UV185+254nm irradiation, the
degradation rate constants of four collectors have the order of SDD˜PEX>>IET>DDA. So in the
study of the effect of initial pH, we choose PEX as representative collector that can be effectively
degraded, and select DDA as typical refractory collector among four collectors with different
molecular structures.
Comment 6. Figure 4 should be changed to C/C0, so it would be easier to visualize the discussed
results. The way it is presented, it is hard to compare them because of the scale of the four graphs.

of thiol collectors for 120 min.
Comment 8. The experiments presented in Figure 4 were performed in which pH?
Response: The experiments presented in Figure 4 were performed at initial pH of 10.0.
Comment 9. The authors could add equations regarding the possible reaction of mineralization for
the four collectors. By adding this, it is easier to understand why using sulfate ions as an indicator
of mineralization.
Response: At the current stage, the degradation pathways of sulfur element in four collectors are
not clear. In addition, due to the different molecular structures of four collectors, the generation
mechanism of SO42- ions for four investigated collectors may be different from each other. So the
addition of equations of SO42- formation is not suitable in this article.
Comment 10. Experimental conditions should be added in figure’s captions.
Response: Experimental conditions were added in the captions of Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4,
Figure 5 and Figure 6. The captions of these six Figures are listed as following:
Figure 2. The variations of relative concentration (Ct/C0) with irradiation time upon UV254nm (a)
and UV185+254nm (b) irradiation. The insets are the pseudo-first-order kinetic fitting of ln(Ct/C0)

Comments to the Author(s)
It is necessary to investigate new methods to remove chemicals from the floatation wastewater.
Authors used UV254+185nm method to degrade a series of flotation chemicals, the mineralization,
the by-products were well investigated, and the manuscript was well written. Thus, I think it can
be accepted.
Response: Thanks to the reviewer 3 for your comments.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper in detail describes photolytic degradation of toxic flotation reagents. It deals with
determining optimal conditions for the degradation, mechanism of degradation and monitoring
certain degradation products. Gaseous byproducts were quantitatively determined which to the
present knowledge there is no available work in the literature. This detailed approach to the
solution of the environmental issue represents valuable information and therefore after minor
revision can be published.
Specific comments
There are some typing errors that should be corrected
Comment 1. Line 90: not scare but scarce
Response: The word “scare” is changed to “scarce”.
Comment 2. Line 91: replace “be different from each other” with differ
Response: the “be different from each other” is replaced as “differ”.
Comment 3. Line 92: “sulfur is a key chemical element in functional groups…”
Response: “sulfur is a key chemical element in functional groups of thiol collectors” is revised as
“the functional groups of thiol collectors have sulfur atoms”.
Comment 4. Line 93 – 94: can you please explain the term organic sulfur because it appears later
in the text
Response: In this work, the organic sulfur refers to the S atoms in collector molecules. Due to the
formation of CS2, H2S and SO42- byproducts, the term “organic sulfur” of collectors is used to
distinguish the inorganic sulfur byproducts such as H2S and SO42-.
Comment 5. Line 96: “… receives rare concern…” please rewrite to be more clear
Response: “… receives rare concern…” is revised as “… receives little concern…”
Comment 6. Line 140: “for” is unclear
Response: the sentence “The irradiation intensity of UV254nm for UV185+254nm lamp was about 90%
of that for UV254nm lamp.” is revised as “The UV254nm irradiation intensity of UV185+254nm lamp
was about 90% of UV254nm lamp.”
Comment 7. Line 165: is the chosen concentration of 100 mg/L near to the real concentration of
collectors in the tailing pond? Why did you choose this concentration as the starting
concentration?
Response: The real collector concentration in tailing ponds is greatly affected with the dosage of
collector in the mineral flotation process. When the tailings are discharged into the ponds, the real
concentration of collectors may be as high as 50~150 mg/L. Therefore, we choose 100mg/L as the
initial collector concentration in this work.
Comment 8. Line 150 – 151: in the name of the Table 1 remove “of thiol collectors”
Response: in the name of Table 1, the “of thiol collectors” is deleted.
Comment 9. Line 228: excited instead exciting
Response: the “exciting” is replaced with “excited”.
Comment 10. Line 247: based on the findings in this section did you from this point forward used
only UV 245+185 nm in your experiments? If so, please add that comment to the end of this
section.
Response: From section 3.2, only UV245+185 nm is used in the experiments. In the section of
“Conclusion”, the sentence “The DDA was the typical refractory flotation collector for
UV185+254nm photolysis.” has been added.
Comment 11. Line 257: in this section you choose only PEX and DDA for investigating the effect
of initial pH, is there a reason for that?
Response: As discussed in section 3.1, it can been seen that under UV185+254nm irradiation, the
degradation rate constants of four collectors have the order of SDD˜PEX>>IET>DDA. So in the
study of the effect of initial pH, we choose PEX as representative collector that can be effectively
degraded, and select DDA as typical refractory collector among four collectors with different
molecular structures.
Comment 12. Line 460: did you state the pH of the investigated solution previously in the text?
You stated that the wastewaters’ pH is neutral to base, were these conditions for the experiment
where you monitored k?
Response: In the section 3.2, we have investigated the effect of initial solution pH on the
UV185+254nm photolysis of PEX and DDA. The pH range for the experiments in section 3.2 was
7.0~12.0. Therefore, we have concluded that neutral pH of flotation wastewaters can facilitate the
collector decomposition.
