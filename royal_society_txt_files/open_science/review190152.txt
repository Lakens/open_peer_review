1-All the results are total data based. No dye decolorization photographs and Toxicity results are
shown.
2- Some sentences are not clear"A 100 ppm metabolite extracted and untreated MR was used for
the test." and grammatical errors are also there.
3- Results and conclusion is not too strong.

This manuscript reports the results on a study of methyl red dye decolorisation by Lysinibacillus
fusiformis bacteria. The study reports interesting, though quite specific results. This manuscript
can be published after minor revisions noted:
- please provide more details on how the Lysinibacillus fusiformis species was identified.
- add scale bars to Fig 1 and check magnification (100[ is not correct)
- revise Fig.4 to make it clearly visible
- the toxicity study models (plants and bacteria), why did you use them, not human cell cultures,
which would be better for this study. Please provide some rationale on this

This manuscript is poorly written to be considered suitable for publication. Many sentences have
not sense, they are not written in intelligible English. It is very difficult to follow and understand
the manuscript. Therefore, I do not recommend its publication.

1-All the results are total data based. No dye decolorization photographs (DONE. It has done by
Figure 4) and Toxicity results are shown (DONE).
The toxicity results are available in Table 2 and 3 and also in this link:
https://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.2cb0g0h
2- Some sentences are not clear"A 100 ppm metabolite extracted and untreated MR was used for
the test."(DONE It has already revised in main document and Table 1 and 2) and grammatical errors
are also there (DONE, it has been revised).
3- Results and conclusion is not too strong. (DONE, it has been revised and added).

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript reports the results on a study of methyl red dye decolorisation by Lysinibacillus
fusiformis bacteria. The study reports interesting, though quite specific results. This manuscript can
be published after minor revisions noted:
- please provide more details on how the Lysinibacillus fusiformis species was identified. It has
already been written on sub chapter 3.2 that isolation and identification of the strain was according
to Reference no 13. (DONE)
- add scale bars to Fig 1 and check magnification (100[ is not correct). It has been revised to 1000
magnification with addition the scale bars (DONE)
- revise Fig.4 to make it clearly visible. DONE and revised as Figure 6
- the toxicity study models (plants and bacteria), why did you use them, not human cell cultures (as a
recommendation), which would be better for this study. Please provide some rationale on this.
This is because of the design of the study involved textile wastewater effluent where the plant might
be the first contact from the discharge area of the effluent. The use of human cell cultures as toxicity
model could be a recommendation for the further study.
