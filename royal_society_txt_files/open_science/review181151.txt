This research provides information on a little-understood period of seabird life history: the early
juvenile stage. The results, though based on an understandably small sample, are stark, clearly
indicating extremely high vulnerability during this period.
Please see the attached file (Appendix A) for a number of editorial suggestions on the Introduction.
Changes and additions are highlighted in yellow. Other than these, my only suggestion is that
more information should be given in support of the Human Threats section under Materials and
Methods. This presently consists merely of a citation to Coll et al. 2012, which is not sufficient.
What defines a "High Threat" area in the classification of Coll et al? As this is crucial to the
interpretation of juvenile mortality, more detail should be given.

I think the paper contributes and performs several interesting analyzes to understand the
differences between adults and juveniles in terms of habitat preferences and behavior. The
research reports a high juvenile mortality within the first week at sea and explore the potential
causes. Overall, the manuscript is concise and well written and in fact I have very few comments.
However, I have a major concern. The relationship between the juveniles’ mortality and fisheries
bycatch is a good idea, and indeed is a plausible explanation, but based in the lack of robust
evidence (age biased bycatch rates from the same population in this area; fine scale spatio-
temporal coincidence between tracking data and AIS or VMS data from fisheries; at very least,
although I'm not sure it will be conclusive, tracking data overlapped with fishing effort data from
the same period in a coarser scale) I found it quite speculative. Therefore, the Title and the
Abstract overstate the results of the research. Due to the current focus of the paper, as stated in
the abstract, is to test the premise that juveniles are particularly vulnerable to bycatch during
their first weeks at sea, I cannot recommend accepting the paper at the current form.
The birds could have died (presumed this because they stopped transmitting) in an area of high
cumulative threats simply by a coincidence that this area is very close to the colony. Some of
them could have died after failing to get food on their first trip to the sea. Although speculative
without evidence, it is also a plausible explanation. Half of the juveniles died during the fifth
days at sea and, according the behavior modes, after they experienced intensive search for food.
Perhaps, something of this may be also suggested at the discussion and abstract. Paradoxically,
this could be the cause of not encountering fishing vessels; An abundant and predictable source
of food, which complements the natural prey of seabirds.

The title should reflect the real outcome of the paper, especially the part after the colon should be
modified.
Abstract. The hypothesis should be reformulated and the effect of bycatch on juvenile mortality
reduced to some extent.
Lines 18 and 45. Although the Procellariiformes are sometimes called petrels, I think it might be
better to include "albatrosses and petrels". Otherwise It should be replaced by Procellariidae.
Line 39 and other places. I would change “accidental” by “incidental”. In addition, “captures”
may fit better than “catches”. Latter term is less used in seabird bycatch studies, except for fish
catches.
Lines 98-100. Cumulative threats should be better defined.
Lines 211-217. I think there is too much emphasis on illegal fishing, when the manuscript does
not have enough evidence to say that juvenile mortality is due to bycatch.

Comments to the Author:
This is an interesting paper that adds to our knowledge of juvenile seabird behavior and survival,
and I think the use of solar powered tags is very exciting! I share the concerns of two reviewers
who recommended major revision and include a word document with some questions and
suggestions in track changes.
The methods were really well written: I would, however, like to see more detail on the tag
sensors. I also would like to know how you calculated “distance travelled per day”. Maybe I
missed it in the Methods, but I didn’t notice anything about this until the Results section.
I think the discussion jumps to illegal fishing as the source of juvenile mortality without
investigating other possibilities. I would like to see more discussion of juvenile mortality in
seabirds in general (eg, what are the riskiest times in terms of life history, what are some other
causes of seabird mortality), and how other causes were ruled out, before concluding that fishing
gear is the most likely explanation.
The figures are great!!

I found the revision to be a substantial improvement over the initial submission. However, while
I think this is an important contribution to the literature, I'd like to see (and it seems from the
other reviewers' comments that others would as well) the language used to describe the findings
and conclusion to match the level of the evidence. I would argue that there is a fair amount of
circumstantial evidence that tagged juveniles "drop off the map" in areas of high threats to
seabirds, especially from fishing. At best, the authors have describe an area of potential risk to
seabirds, much as most coastal areas would be. I'd like to see the discussion and conclusions to
mirror the level of evidence, which would include a healthy does of "potential" or "assumed risk"
or "circumstantial."

TRODUCTION
abirds are most impacted by breeding habitat destruction, alien terrestrial
ecies feeding on adults and juveniles, and by interactions with fisheries [1].
sheries affect seabird populations indirectly through competition for marine
ey, and directly through accidental mortality on fishing gear [2]. Many of
ese accidental catches remain undetected, especially in illegal, unreported
d unregulated fisheries [3] operating in remote areas visited by seabirds
ring their feeding and migratory journeys. Notwithstanding this paucity of
ta, several studies have highlighted seabird bycatch as an important factor in
any population declines [4].
ccidental mortality is especially relevant for long-lived pelagic seabirds,
ch as shearwaters and petrels (Procellariformes) [5]. Mortality associated
th fishing affects whole populations, but juveniles are considered more
lnerable. Juvenile mortality has been associated with inferior foraging skills
mpared to adults, and with less individual experience in navigation strategies
, 7]. Differences in foraging grounds could also increase juvenile
sceptibility to fishing gear, with a higher propensity to attend fishing vessels
]. Juveniles need to improve flight abilities and to gain experience in
entifying predictable and favourable foraging areas [6]. Consequently, the
st months of independence are particularly challenging for their survival [9].
espite major recent advances, studying at-sea movements of juvenile seabirds
mains particularly challenging due to logistic constraints [6]. Specifically, no
study has compared the at-sea movements and fates of adult and juvenile
seabirds with the magnitude of fishing operations within their home ranges.

3 16 ABSTRACT
4
5 17 Accidental seabird harvest by human fisheries is one of the main causes for worldwide
6
7 18 seabird population declines. Such bycatch is particularly severe in petrels
8
9 19 (Procellariiformes), but its prevalence among juvenile individuals was so far unknown.
10
11
20 It has been hypothesized that juveniles are particularly vulnerable to bycatch during
12
13
14 21 their first weeks at sea after leaving the nest. To test this premise, we tracked the at-sea
15
16 22 movements of adults and juveniles Scopoli’s shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) after
17
18 23 the autumn departure from the Chafarinas Islands (southwestern Mediterranean Sea).
19
20 24 Eighty percent of juveniles died during the first week at sea, within 50 km of their natal
21
22 25 colony, in one area with one of the highest fishing pressure concentration in the
23
24
26 Mediterranean Sea. Surviving juvenile and adult birds migrated into the Atlantic and
25
26
27 27 southwards along the coast of West Africa. The two groups thereby showed different
28
29 28 habitat preferences, with juveniles travelling farther from the coast, in windier and less
30
31 29 productive waters than adults. Overall, our study strongly suggests high vulnerability of
32
33 30 juvenile shearwaters, particularly towards bycatch by fisheries.

3 35 INTRODUCTION
4
5 36 Seabirds are most impacted by breeding habitat destructions, alien terrestrial species
6
7 37 feeding on adults and juveniles, and by interactions with fisheries [1]. Fisheries affect
8
9 38 seabird populations directly through competition for marine prey, and indirectly through
10
11
39 accidental mortality on fishing gear [2]. Many of these accidental catches remain
12
13
14 40 undetected, especially in illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries [3] operating in
15
16 41 remote areas visited by seabirds during their feeding and migratory journeys.
17
18 42 Notwithstanding this lack of data, several studies have converged in highlighting
19
20 43 seabird bycatch as an important factor in many population declines [4].
21
22 44 Accidental mortality is especially relevant for long-lived pelagic seabirds, such as
23
24
45 petrels (Procellariforms) [5]. Mortality associated to fishing affects whole populations,
25
26
27 46 albeit juveniles are considered more vulnerable. Juvenile mortality has been associated
28
29 47 to inferior foraging skills compared to adults, and to poorer individual experience in
30
31 48 navigation strategies [6, 7]. Differences in foraging grounds could also increase juvenile
32
33 49 susceptibility to fishing gear, with a higher propensity to attend fishing vessels [8].
34
35 50 Juveniles need to improve flight abilities and experience in identifying predictable and
36
37 51 favourable foraging areas [6]. Consequently, the first months of independence are
38
39
40
52 considered as essential for their survival [9].
41
42 53 Despite major recent advances, studying at-sea movements of juvenile seabirds remains
43
44 54 particularly challenging due to logistics constraints [6]. Specifically, no study had
45
46 55 compared the at-sea movements and the fates of adult and juvenile seabirds while
47
48 56 assessing the magnitude of fishing operations within their home ranges. We filled this
49
50 57 gap, by examining the spatial movements of “naïve” juveniles of Scopoli’s shearwater
51
52
53
58 (Calonectris diomedea) during the first months of their maiden voyage. We used
54
55 59 miniaturized satellite-tracking devices, which were also fitted onto adult birds from the

3 60 same breeding locality. We then modelled the at-sea habitat selection of adults and
4
5 61 juveniles in relation to environmental data, as well as information concerning fishing
6
7 62 activities. This approach allowed us to address two main questions: (i) Are there
8
9 63 differences in apparent survival between shearwater age classes? and (ii) Do individuals
10
11
64 of different age classes show similar migration routes and habitat preferences?

20 68 Fieldwork procedures
21
22 69 This study was conducted at the Chafarinas Islands (southwestern Mediterranean Sea;
23
24
70 figure 1), a small archipelago that holds 800 breeding pairs of Scopoli’s shearwaters
25
26
27 71 based in a highly productive zone supporting an important volume of fisheries [10].
28
29 72 Scopoli’s shearwater is a long-lived seabird with delayed maturity [11]. Immatures only
30
31 73 return to the colony when five or six years old, and the maximum probability of first
32
33 74 breeding is reached at the age of seven [12]. Previous studies at Chafarinas Islands
34
35 75 showed a diet composed mainly by small pelagic fish and demersal resources obtained
36
37 76 from fisheries discards [13].
38
39
40
77 Platform Terminal Transmitters (solar-powered PTTs; Argos-PTT-100, Microwave
41
42 78 Telemetry Inc., USA) were deployed during October 2014 (late chick rearing period) on
43
44 79 10 juveniles born during June 2014 and on five breeding adults. Adults and juveniles
45
46 80 were captured during the night in their nests. PTTs weighed 18 g (< 3% of bird body
47
48 81 mass: 706 ± 75 g and 785 ± 114 g for adults and juveniles, respectively). PTTs were
49
50 82 attached to back feathers using Tesa© tape and Nural92© glue and programmed with a
51
52
53
83 duty cycle of 10 hours ON/ 24 hours. PTT data was processed to remove erroneous

11
88 Behavioral modes in adult and juvenile individuals were classified with an Expectation
12
13
14 89 Maximization binary Clustering (EMbC) algorithm [16] performed using the EMbC R
15
16 90 package [17]. EMbC identifies behavioral modes in movement trajectories based on the
17
18 91 velocity and turning angle of a bird between each location in an unsupervised manner.
19
20 92 Based on local measures of velocity and turning angle of a bird between each location,
21
22 93 locations were classified in four behaviors: (1) resting (low velocity/low turning angle),
23
24
94 (2) intensive search (low velocity/high turning), (3) extensive search (high velocity/high
25
26
27 95 turning angle) and (4) travelling (high velocity/low turning angle).

31 97 Human threats
32
33 98 To identify the hazard level of oceanic areas used by Scopoli’s shearwaters in the
34
35 99 Mediterranean Sea, we used spatially-explicit information of cumulative threats with
36
37 100 potential impact on seabirds [see 18 for more information].

41
42 102 Environmental variables
43
44 103 The main oceanic habitat used by juveniles and adults during their at-sea movements
45
46 104 was modeled with habitat suitability models through a maximum entropy approach [19]
47
48 105 using chlorophyll-a, oceanic winds and bathymetry as habitat variables. In order to
49
50 106 model environmental data consistent with the seabird tracking time period (four months,
51
52
53
107 see results), we divided the latitudinal range of shearwater migratory habitat into
54
55 108 different tiles (two temporal areas for chlorophyll-a data and four temporal areas for

3 109 winds data). Chlorophyll-a and wind data were sourced for each tile covering the time
4
5 110 range of tracking data within the tile. Tiles were merged into a single raster as input for
6
7 111 the species distribution model. To facilitate comparisons across months, we normalized
8
9 112 the images to the scale of 0-1, based on the lowest and highest values of any pixel in
10
11
113 any of the tiles [2]. Chlorophyll-a (mg m-3) data were obtained from aqua MODIS
12
13
14 114 sensor (http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/), at a spatial resolution of 0.0008333° (approx.
15
16 115 9x9 km). We downloaded autumn 2014 seasonal composite data for the first temporal
17
18 116 tile (which covers tracking data from the first departure, 8/10/2014 until 15/11/2014)
19
20 117 and the 2014 wintering seasonal composite for the second temporal tile (time range
21
22 118 from 15/11/2014 until 22/01/2015). Bathymetry was downloaded from the Gridded
23
24
119 Global Relief Data ETOPO2v2 database
25
26
27 120 (https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/etopo2.html) at a spatial resolution of 0.033°
28
29 121 (approximately 3 km). Oceanic winds are one of the most important factors affecting
30
31 122 migratory behavior of seabirds, particularly in birds performing dynamic-soaring, as
32
33 123 shearwaters [1]. Wind data was obtained from the NOAA Blended Sea Winds
34
35 124 (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/rsad/air-sea/seawinds.html), which contain globally
36
37 125 gridded, high resolution ocean surface vector winds and wind stresses on a global 0.25°
38
39
40
126 grid. Wind data was disaggregated into their zonal (east-west) and meridional (north-
41
42 127 south) components. Data was downloaded daily for the October 2014-January 2015
43
44 128 period, and merged in four temporal tiles according to tracking data (from 8/10/2014
45
46 129 until 24/10/2014, second tile from this date until 2/11/2014 and third tile until the last
47
48 130 data recovered on 22/01/2015). All data were resampled to 0.25º, the coarser resolution
49
50 131 supplied by wind data.

3 134 Habitat suitability models were developed through a maximum entropy approach
4
5 135 (Maxent) [3, 4], which models species distribution by estimating the density of
6
7 136 environmental covariates conditioned to a species’ presence [4]. We ran separated
8
9 137 models for adults and juveniles. Models were constructed with the interface of the
10
11
138 standalone Maxent program v. 3.4.0 k
12
13
14 139 (https://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/). Default parameters
15
16 140 were used. Only linear relationships between estimated probabilities of presence and
17
18 141 environmental variables were fitted. Model performance was assessed by randomly
19
20 142 dividing species occurrence data into training (70 %) and test (30 %) datasets, by using
21
22 143 the option “random test percentage” in Maxent. A given model was calibrated on the
23
24
144 training data and evaluated on the test data using the area under the receiver operating
25
26
27 145 characteristics curve (AUC) as a threshold-independent assessment measure. To reduce
28
29 146 uncertainty caused by sampling artifacts (generated during the random resampling of
30
31 147 presence occurrence localities), we conducted 15 replicate models for each of the four
32
33 148 datasets. We evaluated the contribution of environmental variables (bathymetry,
34
35 149 chlorophyll-a and zonal and meridional components of sea surface winds) to the Maxent
36
37 150 model based on a jackknife procedure.

42 152 RESULTS
43
44 153 We successfully recovered 2,691 at-sea locations (2,108 for adults and 583 for
45
46 154 juveniles), distributed between 7 October 2014 and 22 January 2015. Adults tracking
47
48 155 duration ranged 52-103 days, whereas the tracking period for juvenile birds was much
49
50 156 shorter (0-57 days, table 1). Only two of the ten tracked juveniles survived more than
51
52
53
157 one week and reached the Atlantic Ocean. High cumulative threats to seabird species
54
55 158 were concentrated in their foraging areas with a 50 km radius of the colony, where

2
3 159 seven juveniles likely died prematurely (figure 1). Behavioural models (figure 2) show
4
5 160 higher rates of intensive search behaviour in the Mediterranean in juveniles compared to
6
7 161 adults, whereas in the Atlantic Ocean juveniles behaviours change towards a higher
8
9 162 proportion of resting and travelling locations, and intensive search become the most
10
11
163 important behaviour in adults (figure 2).
12
13
14 164 All five tracked adults reached the Atlantic Ocean, between the 16th and 23th of October.
15
16 165 The only two surviving juveniles left the Mediterranean Sea, crossing into the Atlantic,
17
18 166 between the 21th and 23th of October. Total distance travelled by day was slightly
19
20 167 higher in juveniles than in adults in the Atlantic (142.0 ± 22.9 km in adults and 164.3 ±
21
22 168 18.6 km in juveniles), but markedly lower in the Mediterranean (88.2 ± 38.9 km in
23
24
169 adults versus 31.4 ± 17.3 km in juveniles). Adult migration and one juvenile routes ran
25
26
27 170 parallel to the African coast overlapped among individual birds. In contrast, the second
28
29 171 juvenile travelled almost constantly west of the continental shelf (figure 3).
30
31 172 Habitat models showed good ability to predict shearwaters distribution during migration
32
33 173 (AUC=0.8 for both juveniles and adults). Bathymetry was the variable with highest
34
35 174 contribution to distribution of shearwaters during migration: probability of occurrence
36
37 175 of juveniles and adults increased in shallow waters. Chlorophyll-a showed a higher
38
39
40
176 explanatory power for adults (37.0%) than juveniles (12.9%). In relation to wind effect,
41
42 177 juveniles were more affected by the meridional (north-south direction) component of
43
44 178 winds than adults (figure 3).

48 180 DISCUSSION
49
50 181 This study is one of the few describing foraging and migration movements of a marine
51
52
53
182 predator during the first weeks of its life at sea. The disappearance of 80% of all
54
55 183 shearwater juveniles during the first two weeks after leaving the nest strongly suggests

2
3 184 age-skewed mortality during the first days of the migration period. We cannot ascertain
4
5 185 the causes of juvenile death in our study. Nevertheless, as juvenile tracking failure
6
7 186 occurred all at once during intensive foraging behaviour in an area of high cumulative
8
9 187 threats, the most likely cause is that individuals died accidentally in fishing gears [20].
10
11
188 It is noteworthy that this hazardous area north of the colony has been reported as an
12
13
14 189 illegal driftnet swordfish area [21], where the Moroccan driftnet fleet operates year-
15
16 190 round. Furthermore, Morocco has the lowest level of compliance with international
17
18 191 fisheries regulation within countries bordering the North Atlantic [22]. Juvenile
19
20 192 mortality rates in the present study (80 %) exceeded those of previous investigations on
21
22 193 this species at other Mediterranean colonies. Péron et al. [23] reported that 40 % of the
23
24
194 juveniles and 34 % of the adults tagged on the French Mediterranean coast did reach the
25
26
27 195 Atlantic. Further, Raine [24] reported that 66.6 % of tracked juveniles vanished in the
28
29 196 Mediterranean Sea. In great contrast to previous studies, juvenile mortalities off
30
31 197 Morocco were extremely clustered in space and time and did not affect adults which
32
33 198 were fitted in the same manner with the same equipment at the same time. This all
34
35 199 points to accidental juvenile death. Along with threats caused by illegal fishery
36
37 200 practices, behaviour of juvenile could contribute to a high mortality. During their first
38
39
40
201 two weeks in the Mediterranean Sea, juveniles registered more intensive searching
41
42 202 behaviour than adults. The breeding colony of Chafarinas Islands is in the vicinity of
43
44 203 fishing harbours and intense (mostly illegal) fishing activities [21]. Those generate
45
46 204 visual and olfactory cues, which may attract juvenile shearwaters towards fishing
47
48 205 vessels, and into an early death. Travelling behaviour gained in importance once
49
50 206 juveniles reached the Atlantic. There, space use by Scopoli’s shearwaters from
51
52
53
207 Chafarinas Islands off West Africa was similar to that of individuals from other
54
55 208 Mediterranean colonies [25]. Juvenile tracks were more affected by winds than adults,

3 209 moving them away from productive shelf waters selected by adults [23]. Such
4
5 210 exploitation of different regions could also lead to age-biased exposure to bycatch [26].
6
7 211 Overall, our study strongly suggests that artificially inflated juvenile mortality might be
8
9 212 threatening shearwaters populations. Illegal fisheries operating near the colony could be
10
11
213 the cause of this unusually high mortality, whose exact magnitude remains unknown.
12
13
14 214 As highlighted in other studies [27], it seems extremely urgent to detect and control
15
16 215 illegal seabird accidental bycatch and intentional harvest, as those illegal practices
17
18 216 weigh heavily on the persistence of vulnerable seabird populations at the scale of
19
20 217 northwest Africa and of the western Mediterranean.

Appendix C
ASSOCIATE EDITOR'S (Dr Denise Greig):
Comment #1: This is an interesting paper that adds to our knowledge of juvenile seabird
behavior and survival, and I think the use of solar powered tags is very exciting! I share the
concerns of two reviewers who recommended major revision and include a word document with
some questions and suggestions in track changes.
Reply to #1: As you can see above, we answered and included all the comments and suggestions
provided by the three reviewers. We believe that now the manuscript improved a lot from the
original submission.
Comment #2: The methods were really well written: I would, however, like to see more detail
on the tag sensors. I also would like to know how you calculated “distance travelled per day”.
Maybe I missed it in the Methods, but I didn’t notice anything about this until the Results section.
Reply to #2: We included more details relating to the tag sensors (see lines 83-87) and to the
methodology used to estimate the distance travelled per day (see lines 95-97).
lines 83-87: Tracking devices were solar-powered satellite transmitters (PTTs, Platform Terminal
Transmitters, Argos PTT-100, Microwave Telemetry Inc., Columbia, USA). These tags allow
Argos satellite monitoring They are the unique way to follow migration movements in a close real
time of long distance marine predators, since animals are tracked over large spatial scales for a
long time and devices are difficult to recover [14].
lines 95-97: For each individual, we calculated total distance covered in the Mediterranean and
in the Atlantic waters. Distance travelled by day was calculated as total distance divided by the
range of days between first and last location.
Comment #3: I think the discussion jumps to illegal fishing as the source of juvenile mortality
without investigating other possibilities. I would like to see more discussion of juvenile mortality
in seabirds in general (e.g., what are the riskiest times in terms of life history, what are some
other causes of seabird mortality), and how other causes were ruled out, before concluding that
fishing gear is the most likely explanation.
Reply to #3: Following this comment and the different comments of the Reviewer #2 (see
comments #13 and #15) and the Reviewer #3 (see comments #1, #2), we discussed other potential
possibilities that could be related to juvenile mortality in seabirds: logger detachment or devices
failure, environmental factors such as storms attraction to artificial lights and inferior juveniles
foraging skills (see lines 228-240), and juveniles behavior (lines 260-271). In addition, we
1
improved the discussion section regarding that fishing activity could be the most likely
explanation of the observed mortality (lines 241-259)
Comment #4: The figures are great!!
Reply to #4: Many thanks for this comment. Figures are an important element when transmitting
science, so we always try to do nice figures and we are very pleased if other researchers like them.
In addition to accept all the grammatical corrections provided by the Associate Editor in the
attached document, we answered the specific comments:
Comment #5: Line 37: Not sure what you mean by alien.
Reply to #5: We have changed “alien” to “invasive terrestrial species”.
Comment #6: Line 46: Maybe just say Procellarids here because it is confusing when you switch
from petrels to shearwaters without saying that they are both in the same family.
Reply to #6: Changed.
Comment #7: Two separate ideas here – split into two sentences?
Reply to #7: We have changed to “Differences in foraging grounds could thereby increase
juvenile susceptibility to fishing gear” (lines 55-56).
Comment #8: Please list some of these contraints.
Reply to #8: We have included “..particularly challenging due to logistical constraints because
they are distributed remotely in the open ocean during several years” (lines 59-60).
Comment #9: Line 78: What are fisheries discards? Is this bycatch that is dumped at sea?
Reply to #9: Yes, the fisheries discards are the bycatch discarded into the sea. We have modified
this line in the revised manuscript: “….pelagic fish and demersal resources present in the bycatch
discarded by fisheries into the sea “ (lines 81-82).
Comment #10: Line 83: Adults are smaller than the juveniles? For clarity, I would split out and
avoid “respectively”. For example adults = 706 ± 75 g and juveniles =785 ± 114 g.
Reply to #10: We have changed this sentence to: “PTTs weighed 18 g (< 3% of bird body mass
of adults= 706 ± 75 g and of juveniles= 785 ± 114 g). “ (lines 90-91).
Comment #11: line 93: So, did the tags have accelerometers? Please include all the sensors the
tag had in the paragraph above.
2
Reply to #11: The tags used in this study did not have accelerometer. For this reason, we used
the EMbC algorithm to identify behavior.
Comment #12: line 201: I would change this word “accidental”– I’m not sure what you mean
by it.
Reply to #12: We have changed it to “unintentional”.

REVIEWER: 1 (Pepper W. Trail, Ph.D.)
This research provides information on a little-understood period of seabird life history: the early
juvenile stage. The results, though based on an understandably small sample, are stark, clearly
indicating extremely high vulnerability during this period.
Comment #1: Please see the attached file for a number of editorial suggestions on the
Introduction. Changes and additions are highlighted in yellow
Reply to #1: All the editorial suggestions provided by Dr. Pepper W. Trail were incorporated in
the revised manuscript.
Comment #2: Other than these, my only suggestion is that more information should be given in
support of the Human Threats section under Materials and Methods. This presently consists
merely of a citation to Coll et al. 2012, which is not sufficient. What defines a "High Threat" area
in the classification of Coll et al? As this is crucial to the interpretation of juvenile mortality,
more detail should be given.
Reply to #2: We have developed the information on the Human Threat spatial information
used in our study (see lines 116-125): “In particular, this index is a weighted sum of each
of the following anthropogenic threats affecting seabirds: coastal-based impacts (0.08),
marine pollution (0.31), exploitation of resources (0.38), maritime activities (0.08) and
climate change (0.15). Vulnerability weights (annotated in parenthesis) applied to
seabirds species were estimated using published data on specific taxa and expert
opinions [see 19 for more information]. Index value was extracted for each foraging
location of the individuals in the Mediterranean Sea. Kruskal-Wallis tests were
conducted to examine the differences on index values associates to the locations
according to age and survival capacity (adults, juveniles that stopped the transmission
and juveniles transmitting data). Analysis were performed in R v. 3.4.1 [20]”.

REVIEWER: 2
All of my comments are in the text of the annotated pdf.
In addition to accept all the grammatical corrections provided in the attached document, we
answer the different comments:
Comment #1: Line 37: I expected this citation to be Croxall et al. 2012 [Ref. 5], which is a review
of all of the interactions listed. I think it's a better citation that the Le Bot one, although that is a
good recent reference for fisheries interactions.
Reply to #1: We have included this reference.
Comment #2: Lines 63-64: I'd reverse the order of these questions.
Reply to #2: Changed following reviewer suggestion
Comment #3: Line 68: Maybe separate paragraphs for study system and study organism?
Reply to #3: If it is possible, we would like to maintain only one section. However, to be more
clear, we change the head of this caption from “Fieldwork procedures” to “Study area and
fieldwork procedures”.
Comment #4: lines 98-100: Human threats. Needs some more info here; also is a one-sentence
paragraph.
Reply to #4: We have developed the information on the Human Threat spatial information used
in our study (see lines 116-125): “In particular, this index is a weighted sum of each of the
following anthropogenic threats affecting seabirds: coastal-based impacts (0.08),
marine pollution (0.31), exploitation of resources (0.38), maritime activities (0.08) and
climate change (0.15). Vulnerability weights (annotated in parenthesis) applied to
seabirds species were estimated using published data on specific taxa and expert
opinions [see 19 for more information]. Index value was extracted for each foraging
location of the individuals in the Mediterranean Sea. Kruskal-Wallis tests were
conducted to examine the differences on index values associates to the locations
according to age and survival capacity (adults, juveniles that stopped the transmission
and juveniles transmitting data). Analysis were performed in R v. 3.4.1 [20]”.
5
Comment #5: lines 122-123: This info would be better in the one-sentence paragraph above.
Also, this sentence suggests a similar sentence justifying the choices of bathymetry and
chlorophyll should be included.
Reply to #5: We moved this sentence above and included a new sentence explaining why
chlorophyll and bathymetry are important for seabirds (lines 131-134).
Comment #6: Lines 128-130: Four tiles or three tiles? (line 129).
Reply to #6: Three tiles. Amended in the revised manuscript.
Comment #7: Line 148: remind us of the four datasets? Is it the environmental variable listed
in the next sentence?
Reply to #7: Yes, the datasets to which we refer, are the environmental variables. We have
reworded the sentence for a better understanding (lines 173-175).
Comment #8: Lines 157-158: What are these threats? Seems more like a discussion point than
a result.
Reply to #8: We have performed new analyses to highlight the human threat index information
used in this work (methodology, lines 122-125 and new results in lines 190-193). Basically, we
have conducted Kruskal-Wallis tests to compare index values in the foraging areas among
adults, juveniles that stopped the transmission died, and juveniles that survive.
Comment #9: Line 160: Are all of these differences mentioned significant? There are no
statistical tests presented and the SDs are quite large. I think this merits some statistical
analyses.
Reply to #9: We have performed a two-sample test for equality of proportions for comparing
behavioural modes among the first days of independence (Mediterranean Sea) and the locations
during the migration period in the Atlantic Ocean. We have included new information in the
methods section (lines 108-111) and we have rewritten the results paragraph (lines 197-201)
Comment #10: Line 166-169: Picky point: since emphasis is on the lower numbers, why not
put those first in comparison (juv v. adult)?
Reply to #10: Done.
Comment #11: Line 169-170: I don't understand the end of this sentence.
Reply to #11: We have changed to “The migration routes of the five adults and of one juvenile
were similar, flying in parallel to the African coast”
6
Comment #12: Line 186-187: Again, this is not defined or really discussed. Moreover, blaming
illegal fisheries is even harder to argue.
Reply to #12: We agree with the referee in that the statement was weakly argued. We have
added information on the meaning of what high values of threat index suppose for seabirds
(lines 116-119), and we have replaced the emphatic assertion about fishing practices with
further and most accurate arguments (lines 241-259).
Comment #13: Line 192: But pretty small sample sizes...and what about tag loss? It should be
at least discussed.
Reply to #13: We have added information about the sample size to evidence the constrains of the
work (lines 225, 227). Nevertheless, information about sample size included now for the other
works cited, are also small. Furthermore, we discussed other potential possibilities that could be
related to the stop of the transmission (logger detachment or devices failure, environmental factors
such as storms attraction to artificial lights and inferior juveniles foraging skills, see lines 228-
240 and 260-271). In addition, we improved the discussion section regarding that fishing activity
could be the most likely explanation of the observed mortality (lines 241-259)
Comment #14: Lines 193-195: Assuming these sample sizes are also small. Can you give the
sample sizes in the text -- 40% of #? 66.6% of #?
Reply to #14: Sample sizes have been added after the percentages (lines 225 and 227).
Comment #15: Lines 211-212: Have the authors considered storms or other factors to explain
the 8 of 10 tag losses? It is also only one year. It may well be that illegal fisheries are to blame,
but I'm unconvinced by the arguments presented.
Reply to #15: We included this consideration in the discussion section (lines 234-240):
“Although different causes could explain it such, for example, effects of strong storms events
[25] or light-induced mortality [26], we suggest that mortality associated to fishing activity was
the most probably cause of the observed juvenile failure [27]. The effect of particular
oceanographic occurrence as strong storms could cause mortality events in seabirds [25].
However, no storm was recorded in the area where juveniles stopped the transmission (based
on the wind data downloaded from NOAA database, see Material and Methods). Also, artificial
lights associated to a nearby tourist resort may have attracted satellite-tracked juveniles
towards land, with likely casualties [28]. However, this resort was still under construction
during the study period, with very limited night-time activities, and we did not record any
position on land within this area [30].”

REVIEWER: 3
I think the paper contributes and performs several interesting analyses to understand the
differences between adults and juveniles in terms of habitat preferences and behaviour. The
research reports a high juvenile mortality within the first week at sea and explore the potential
causes. Overall, the manuscript is concise and well written and in fact I have very few comments.
Comment #1: I have a major concern. The relationship between the juveniles’ mortality and
fisheries bycatch is a good idea, and indeed is a plausible explanation, but based in the lack of
robust evidence (age biased bycatch rates from the same population in this area; fine scale spatio-
temporal coincidence between tracking data and AIS or VMS data from fisheries; at very least,
although I'm not sure it will be conclusive, tracking data overlapped with fishing effort data from
the same period in a coarser scale) I found it quite speculative. Therefore, the Title and the
Abstract overstate the results of the research. Due to the current focus of the paper, as stated in
the abstract, is to test the premise that juveniles are particularly vulnerable to bycatch during
their first weeks at sea, I cannot recommend accepting the paper at the current form.
Reply to #1: Yes, the lack of accurate data of fisheries bycatch is one important concern of our
study. To our regret, fisheries data from Morocco and Algeria, in terms of AIS / VMS data or
fishing effort datasets as Global Fishing Watch (see below a capture of three months vessel
activity cumulative data, from October 2014 to December 2014 as an example), are almost non-
existent, making from this area a great coverage gap. This is probably because most of the vessels
working in this Mediterranean area are small (artisanal) and without any obligation to report the
tracking and fishing data. In fact, for this reason we have been forced to use an indirect threat
index as the one published by Coll et al. 2012 to evaluate fishing risk for seabirds in our study
area. Nevertheless, this referee (and the other two referees) is right in that, in the absence of data,
we have overstated the results of this work. So, we discussed other possibilities that could be
related to juvenile mortality in seabirds: logger detachment or devices failure, environmental
factors such as storms attraction to artificial lights and inferior juveniles foraging skills (see lines
232-240). In addition, we improved the discussion section regarding that fishing activity could be
the most likely explanation of the observed mortality (lines 241-259).

Comment #2: The birds could have died (presumed this because they stopped transmitting) in
an area of high cumulative threats simply by a coincidence that this area is very close to the
colony. Some of them could have died after failing to get food on their first trip to the sea.
Although speculative without evidence, it is also a plausible explanation. Half of the juveniles
died during the fifth days at sea and, according the behaviour modes, after they experienced
intensive search for food. Perhaps, something of this may be also suggested at the discussion and
abstract. Paradoxically, this could be the cause of not encountering fishing vessels; An abundant
and predictable source of food, which complements the natural prey of seabirds.
Reply to #2: We have modified in the text most of the assumption of died juveniles, and we have
replaced it with more accurate designation as “loss of tracking”, “tracking drop”, “juveniles
tracking failure” or “stop transmitting”. Also, we re-wrote part of the discussion reflecting
different plausible explanations (lines 232-240, 260-271)
Comment #3: The title should reflect the real outcome of the paper, especially the part after the
colon should be modified.
Reply to #3: We have modified the title which now appears as “Maiden voyage into death: are
fisheries affecting seabird juvenile survival during the first days at-sea?”.
Comment #4: Abstract. The hypothesis should be reformulated and the effect of bycatch on
juvenile mortality reduced to some extent.
Reply to #4: We have modified the abstract, opening it to the possibilities of other factors in
addition to bycatch for fail in transmission rates of juveniles. The effect of bycatch has been
limited as the main central thread of the work.

Comment #5: Lines 18 and 45. Although the Procellariiformes are sometimes called petrels, I
think it might be better to include "albatrosses and petrels". Otherwise It should be replaced by
Procellariidae.
Reply to #5: Amended in the revised manuscript.
Comment #6: Line 39 and other places. I would change “accidental” by “incidental”. In
addition, “captures” may fit better than “catches”. Latter term is less used in seabird bycatch
studies, except for fish catches.
Reply to #6: Changed.
Comment #7: Lines 98-100. Cumulative threats should be better defined.
Reply to #7: We have developed the meaning of the Human Threat spatial information used in
our study (see lines 116-121).
Comment #8: Lines 211-217. I think there is too much emphasis on illegal fishing, when the
manuscript does not have enough evidence to say that juvenile mortality is due to bycatch.
Reply to #8: We have modified the last paragraph, including juvenile inexperience in foraging
behaviour as other plausible cause of juvenile loss.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Denise Greig):
Thank you for your responses to reviewer comments and revisions to this
mansucript - I enjoyed reading the new version. I am attaching a file with track
changes which includes a few comments and some edits for clarity. Please
make sure that I have not misinterpreted anything.
Response to Editor: thank you so much for your comments. We have
introduced all changes proposed except those related to the style of citing
tables and figures. We have not capitalized “Table” or “Figure” and we have
maintained “table” and “figure” following recent papers in the journal.

I have carefully read the manuscript and saw that the authors have positivelly
addressed the comments I raised in the previous version. I think that the
manuscript should be accepted.
Response to Reviewer 2: thank you so much for your previous revision.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
I found the revision to be a substantial improvement over the initial
submission. However, while I think this is an important contribution to the
literature, I'd like to see (and it seems from the other reviewers' comments
that others would as well) the language used to describe the findings and
conclusion to match the level of the evidence. I would argue that there is a fair
amount of circumstantial evidence that tagged juveniles "drop off the map" in
areas of high threats to seabirds, especially from fishing. At best, the authors
have describe an area of potential risk to seabirds, much as most coastal areas
would be. I'd like to see the discussion and conclusions to mirror the level of
evidence, which would include a healthy does of "potential" or "assumed risk"
or "circumstantial."
Response to Reviewer 2: Following the suggestions from reviewer, we have
tried to use a more “honest” language, trying to reflect the level of evidence
of our results. All arguments related to the mortality of juveniles in fishing
gears have been expressed as potential and likely possibility (lines 240, 249,
250, 253, 259-261, 267. We hope that with these changes the manuscript
would reflect the discussion with the rigor demanded.
