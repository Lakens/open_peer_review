Using a between subject design, Nilsonne et al investigate the effects of 25mg of the
benzodiazepine oxazepam, on emotional mimicry and empathy for pain in a placebo-controlled
study in 76 participants. To study mimicry, they performed facial EMG recordings combined
with presentation of videos showing emotional facial expressions. To study empathy, they used
the standard empathy for pain paradigm (involving painful stimulation of the participant and a
confederate, and affect ratings pertaining to these stimulations).
In the mimicry experiment, oxazepam inhibited zygomatic responses across happy and angry
conditions, but did not have a significant main effect on corrugator responses. In the empathy for
pain task, oxazepam did not cause lower rated unpleasantness specifically in the pain for other
condition.The authors conclude that there is no specific effect of oxazepam on emotional mimicry
or empathy.
The study sample size is high for this kind of study, the experimental design is sound (except
oxazepam dose). Analyses are performed thoroughly.
The results are, even if they do not confirm initial hypothesis, informative for the community
interested in psychopharmacological effects on social emotional behaviors. The paper is written
intelligibly, but English should be improved.
My only major concern relates to the choice of oxyzepam dose. The authors explain: “Several
researchers have theorised that emotional mimicry is a basic mechanism for sharing of emotions,
on which more complex forms of empathy are based [6,9,10]. (…) … emotional mimicry
correlates to accurate decoding of emotional expressions, although this effect remains
controversial [13].”
In the discussion section they state: “Diazepam (15 mg) has been previously found to impair
identification of angry and fearful faces [62,63]. Similarly, another investigation found global
impairment by 15 mg diazepam of identification of emotional faces [64]. In two other studies, 2
mg lorazepam [65] and 5 mg diazepam [66] did not effect recognition of facial emotional
expressions, consistent with a dose dependent effect.”
Given that 25mg of oxazepam is thought to be equivalent to approx. 12.5 mg of diazepam, I am
unsure whether we look at impaired emotion recognition in the mimicry experiment. It appears
that this study design would not allow testing the hypothesis (ie specific effects on mimicry) at
the outset?
This should be clarified already in the introduction section.
Further points:
Then, in building the hypothesis, and study aim: Since the empathic representation of others’
emotional states is likely to inhibit aggressive and antisocial behaviour, and since
benzodiazepines have been reportedly used to facilitate
aggressive and violent behaviour, we hypothesised that benzodiazepines would inhibit empathic
responding.
3
- This logic is confusing. Benzos seem to increase aggression and therefore, one might tentatively
speculate that they might affect empathy. The role of empathy in inhibiting aggression has no
relevance here, if anything, the causality should go the other way.
In the introduction, paragraphs should be connected and not stand in isolation.
Then please elaborate on or omit the second last sentence “It has recently been suggested that the
endogenous opioid system may interact with the empathy response in the brain. However, it is
not known whether the GABA system interacts with empathy [19].”
- Unless a specific link is made between GABAergic system and the opioid system, I don’t
see why the opioid system should be relevant here. In my view, it is novel enough per se to
perform a benzodiazepine study of mimcry and empathy.
Overall, I think the introduction and discussion sections should be rewritten to somehow
accommodate past scientific evidence that give rise to a speculation on a specific mechanism re
mimicry/ empathy.

Nilsonne and colleagues investigated the effects of oxazepam (a benzodiazepine) on emotional
mimicry and empathy for pain, as well as the relationship between personality traits and
emotional mimicry and empathy for pain. The methodology is clearly reported and appropriate,
but there are some aspects of the framing of the study and interpretation of results that require
clarification. These are detailed below.
1. The authors begin by discussing the universal nature of facial expressions. While there is a
large amount of evidence for the universality of some emotions, there also seem to be some
developmental and cross-cultural differences. This literature also does not seem particularly
relevant to the discussion of emotional mimicry (except for the fact that some accounts suggest
that emotional mimicry actually leads to the universality of emotional expressions, as we learn
4
how expressions are produced via mimicry of others’ expressions, instead of automatically and
innately producing universal expressions). The relevance of this evidence could be made more
explicit, but the authors could also use this space to discuss emotion contagion in slightly more
detail. Although the authors state that they will be referring to ‘emotional mimicry’ as emotion
contagion without emotion convergence being required, it should be made clear that
theoretically, emotion contagion refers to mirroring another’s internal state, not simply another’s
behaviour.
2. Relatedly, the authors later state that ‘more complex forms of empathy’ are based on emotional
mimicry. It would be useful to provide a little more detail on these facets of empathy, in order to
make their operational definition of empathy and its different domains explicit throughout.
The introduction could more explicitly introduce the multiple facets of empathy, and describe the
way in which each is related to the tasks to be employed in the current study. For example, the
author mention that the emotional mimicry task may index emotional contagion, but do not
describe the facet of empathy intended to be indexed by the arousal/subjective ratings in
response to the empathy for pain task. This task also seems to tap into the emotion
contagion/personal distress component of empathy. More detailed discussion of the facets of
empathy being assessed in this study (i.e. the automatic emotion contagion aspect, rather than the
later, more cognitive, empathic concern aspect) would help readers to interpret the findings.
Similarly, these facets are not mentioned in the discussion section. The findings would be easier
to interpret if they were positioned within existing empathy frameworks, and this would also
help to build the rationale for the current study in the introduction.
3. Section 3.c.ii – the relationship between the Fearless Dominance subscale, self-centred
impulsivity subscale of the PPI-R and the TAS-20 with corrugator/zygomatic mimicry could be
explained more clearly. At the moment, it is slightly unclear what increased scores on these scales
are associated with.
4. Section 3.d.i – the interaction between shock intensity and self/other condition could be
explained in more detail – was it the case that high intensity stimuli were rated as less unpleasant
in the other than the self condition, but unpleasantness ratings did not vary between the self and
other conditions for low intensity stimuli? Post hoc tests would also be useful here to break down
the interaction. The same is true of the two-way interactions presented in sections 3.d.iii, iv and v.
5. There is no discussion of how the IRI subscales separately relate to the empathy for pain
measures. If it is the case that the empathy for pain measures index the emotion contagion aspect
of empathy, one would expect them to be more strongly associated with the personal distress
subscale of the IRI than the other subscales (and has been demonstrated previously).
6. Some discussion of the lack of effect of Oxazepam on corrugator activity would be useful. It is
difficult to conclude that the current findings implicate GABA as a regulatory neurotransmitter
for facial emotional expressions generally when this finding only replied to one muscle. Similarly,
the authors also conclude that Oxazepam did not inhibit emotional mimicry, but that it did
inhibit zygomatic EMG responses. As this appears to be the only measure of emotional mimicry,
it is not clear what the authors are concluding. Clearer discussion of the meaning of this effect is
necessary.
7. The results and discussion section could also be clearer about the effects of Oxazepam on
ratings of unpleasantness. In section 3.d.i, the authors report that Oxazepam had no effect on
unpleasantness ratings, and that there was no three-way interaction, but in section 4b, they state
that Oxazepam was associated with increased unpleasantness ratings. Clarification here is
required, particularly in terms of whether effects were similar in the self and other conditions, as
this was used as a measure of empathy.
5
8. In general, the discussion of the paper focuses little on the effects of Oxazepam, despite this
being the major research question of the study. While the results did not support the hypotheses,
more discussion of how to interpret the current findings, within the context of previous findings,
would be useful.

oxazepam, on emotional mimicry and empathy for pain in a placebo-controlled study in 76 participants.

The results are, even if they do not confirm initial hypothesis, informative for the community interested

design would not allow testing the hypothesis (ie specific effects on mimicry) at the outset?
This should be clarified already in the introduction section.
>> The reviewer remarks that the dose of oxazepam may not be sufficiently high to affect emotion
recognition, and recommends that the oxazepam dose be justified in the introduction in relation to
earlier literature. However, the quoted passage from the discussion section pertains not to studies of our
outcome of interest - emotional mimicry - but to studies of identification/recognition of emotional
expressions.
Emotional mimicry is spontaneous and automatic and has been demonstrated in experiments with
stimulus presentations so brief that emotional stimuli are not consciously perceived. The choice of the
relatively low dose was motivated by the desire to maintain blinding, as described in the methods
section. The effect of Oxazepam was validated by reaction time tests and anxiety ratings, and the dose
of 25 mg is not far below equivalence to 15 mg Diazepam. It is an empirical question whether
benzodiazepine affects mimicry at lower or higher doses compared to identification/recognition. We
therefore respectfully do not agree with the reviewer that this study was invalidated at the outset by its
design with respect to the emotional mimicry outcome.
Further points:
Then, in building the hypothesis, and study aim: Since the empathic representation of others’ emotional
states is likely to inhibit aggressive and antisocial behaviour, and since benzodiazepines have been
reportedly used to facilitate aggressive and violent behaviour, we hypothesised that benzodiazepines

In the introduction, paragraphs should be connected and not stand in isolation.
>> We have added a clause in the end of paragraph 2 and removed the leading sentence of paragraph 4
in order to maintain a connection.
Then please elaborate on or omit the second last sentence “It has recently been suggested that the
endogenous opioid system may interact with the empathy response in the brain. However, it is not
known whether the GABA system interacts with empathy [19].”

past scientific evidence that give rise to a speculation on a specific mechanism re mimicry/ empathy.
>> In the discussion, we comment on the proposed mechanism that GABA signaling in the anterior
insula causes empathic responding, as suggested by an MR spectroscopy study. However, our findings
are predominantly negative, and their direction contradicts the mechanism proposed by the
spectroscopy study. We are not aware of other evidence that informs the mechanistic question. As
described in the introduction, the motivation behind this study came from clinical observation rather
than mechanistic theory.

task. This task also seems to tap into the emotion contagion/personal distress component of empathy.
More detailed discussion of the facets of empathy being assessed in this study (i.e. the automatic
emotion contagion aspect, rather than the later, more cognitive, empathic concern aspect) would help
readers to interpret the findings. Similarly, these facets are not mentioned in the discussion section. The
findings would be easier to interpret if they were positioned within existing empathy frameworks, and
this would also help to build the rationale for the current study in the introduction.
>> The four-factor structure of the IRI was not replicated in the attempt to validate the Swedish
translation (Cliffordson et al, described in Methods, 2.d.i). In that study, the EC was shown to form one
factor and the remaining three subscales formed one other factor. Therefore, we were not able to study
differential relationships of experimental outcomes to facets of empathy as measured by the IRI. While
we agree with the reviewer’s reasoning around these theoretical concepts, we are not able to underpin
such reasoning with data in the present study. This has been clarified in section 2.d.i. We have also
augmented the introduction to try to position our research question in relation to facets of empathy in
existing frameworks (introduction, third paragraph).
3. Section 3.c.ii – the relationship between the Fearless Dominance subscale, self-centred impulsivity
subscale of the PPI-R and the TAS-20 with corrugator/zygomatic mimicry could be explained more
clearly. At the moment, it is slightly unclear what increased scores on these scales are associated with.
>> We have added an explanation of the analysis strategy (Section 3.c.ii) and clarified the legend to
figure 6.
4. Section 3.d.i – the interaction between shock intensity and self/other condition could be explained in
more detail – was it the case that high intensity stimuli were rated as less unpleasant in the other than
the self condition, but unpleasantness ratings did not vary between the self and other conditions for low
intensity stimuli? Post hoc tests would also be useful here to break down the interaction. The same is
true of the two-way interactions presented in sections 3.d.iii, iv and v.
>> Post-hoc tests have been added as requested.
5. There is no discussion of how the IRI subscales separately relate to the empathy for pain measures. If
it is the case that the empathy for pain measures index the emotion contagion aspect of empathy, one
would expect them to be more strongly associated with the personal distress subscale of the IRI than
the other subscales (and has been demonstrated previously).
>> As described above, the four-factor structure of the IRI was not replicated in the attempt to validate
the Swedish translation (Cliffordson et al, described in Methods, 2.d.i). In that study, the EC was shown
to form one factor and the remaining three subscales formed one other factor. Therefore, we decided to
show the results for all the four subscales, but not to draw conclusions with respect to differences
between subscales.
6. Some discussion of the lack of effect of Oxazepam on corrugator activity would be useful. It is difficult
to conclude that the current findings implicate GABA as a regulatory neurotransmitter for facial
emotional expressions generally when this finding only replied to one muscle. Similarly, the authors also
conclude that Oxazepam did not inhibit emotional mimicry, but that it did inhibit zygomatic EMG
responses. As this appears to be the only measure of emotional mimicry, it is not clear what the authors
are concluding. Clearer discussion of the meaning of this effect is necessary.
>> We have clarified the discussion (4a, first paragraph).
7. The results and discussion section could also be clearer about the effects of Oxazepam on ratings of
unpleasantness. In section 3.d.i, the authors report that Oxazepam had no effect on unpleasantness
ratings, and that there was no three-way interaction, but in section 4b, they state that Oxazepam was
associated with increased unpleasantness ratings. Clarification here is required, particularly in terms of
whether effects were similar in the self and other conditions, as this was used as a measure of
empathy.
>> This finding was not properly reported in the initial submission – it is a 2-way interaction effect,
shown also in the post hoc tests requested by the reviewer, and now fully described in the results
section.
8. In general, the discussion of the paper focuses little on the effects of Oxazepam, despite this being
the major research question of the study. While the results did not support the hypotheses, more
discussion of how to interpret the current findings, within the context of previous findings, would be
useful.
>> We have added a paragraph further discussing interpretation of our findings in the context of earlier
literature (4b, paragraph 5).
Minor point:
Figure 11 has p values shown as ‘0’ rather than <.001.
>> We have changed p values in figure 11 from “0” to “< 0.001”, and also harmonized the numbers of
significant digits in figures 6 and 11.
