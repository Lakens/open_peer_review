Overall this paper is most interesting when considering the frogs and less so than the wireless
sensors. For the latter, I really think they need to compare it to some of the other methods. I have
a number of questions about the numerical methods, but those are largely minor issues. There
are some other points that need clarification and the paper needs to be edited by a native speaker.
I think you might also look at the papers by Belykh, Belykh and Hasler where synchrony was
analyzed as the topology changed.
minor points (some less minor than others)
page 2 flock -> flocking
page 3 to -> over
page 7 In equation 2,3 you mean each time the phase hits 0 mod 2 pi the energy is decremented
by 1 and the fatigue incremental by 1, correct? This should be stated explicitly since delta(x)
means transversal crossing at x=0 and this is not the case here
page 10 In your earlier PRE paper you used sin(x) + c sin(2x) in order to get clusters as well as
the triphase state. Is there a reason you don’t use that in this paper since that seems to be what
the frogs do
page 11 It seems like you synchronously evaluate the prob of switching every 3.5 seconds. This
is a correct numerical implementation. I would think it should be more like a voltage gated ion
channel where the rate of transition depends on the fatigue etc. this seems like a strange update
rule. The right way would be to take the probability and divide by 3.5 to get a rate R and then if h
is the time step for the ode model, at each such time step, choose a uniform random number, x,
between 0 and 1. If x< h R then make the transition. This is the proper approximation if you are
assuming a cts markov process.
page 12
When the animal switches to the call state is the phase the same as it was when it left the call state
in the previous bout? This seems unrealistic that it would recall the phase. Seems more likely it
starts randomly or at 0
page 14
So the theta_m inside Gamma makes no difference and this is the Winfree pulse coupled model.
It would seem that this model would also be better for the frogs since they don’t interact
continuously but rather only when the other is calling. I understand that the cts interaction you
guys show can come from weak coupling, but it would be better to be consistent in your
modeling

page 15
Instead or requiring the reader to figure out that sqrt(2) means talk to the 6 neighbors, just say it
is a Moore neighborhood or say the 6 immediate neighbors
Eq15 is discontinuous at 0 and 2pi. It should be cts there like the sine model

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors investigated calling behavior of two or three frogs and found a group of frogs self-
organizes their calling behavior in two different time scale; in short time scale, individual frog
calls alternatively from the other frogs; in log time scale, a group of frogs switches between
alternative calling state and silent state. The authors modeled these two behaviors using a
coupled-oscillator system additionally introduced stochastic state switching mechanism. Last, the
mechanism of this behavior was applied to a wireless sensor network problem.
Their findings of the two hierarchical behavior of the frog is interesting, and the idea of the
application is fine. It is, however, the paper leaves room for improvement as listed below.
Main points
1. It is fine they succeeded in modeling of the frog behavior and found the silent state is useful
for energy saving. So, how the efficiency depends on the parameters, especially on the coupling
strength (K), the detection sensitivity of calling neighbors (H)? This kind of analysis would give a
benefit in design of wireless sensor networks. The variable, energy E is not so important in the
dynamics, if the author do not analyze the efficiency.
2. The proposed model is for just two or three frogs, while the number of units in the wireless
sensor network is more than those up to 100. Why they did not construct a model of nearest (or
second nearest) neighbor coupling system for the frog system (They did it in their previous work
4
ref[23]).
3. Most part of the basic idea has been already proposed in the reference [33] written by one of
the authors of this submitted paper. This work should be introduced in the introduction part and
the authors should present what is the main novel point of this paper differently from the
previous one.
Minor points
1. The names of axes G1(Tn) and G2(Tn) in Fig. 3 are inconsistent with the explanation of Eq. (7,8)
and Eq. (10); They are exchanged.
2. In Fig. 4B, last panel, it is difficult to find the feature of the tri-phase. How about the different
combination of the data are colored different? The same problem is found in Fig. 7C, in which the
partial magnified graph will be helpful for readers.

Most of my concerns have been addressed except for the followin minor points:
(Answer to my major comment 1)
The authors added a new measure t_pow to capture dependence of system behavior on
parameters alpha, K_nm, and p_high. For K_nm, they examine on the domain K_nm >= 0.5. How
about K_nm <0.5?
Relating to this, in page 10, line 258, they describe the parameter setting as K_nm=0.20. In
contrast they stated, in their rebuttal document, that “performed the simulation with the correct
value (i.e., K_nm=1.0). Please correct the conflict.
(Answer to my minor comment 2)
They added an enlarged graph of the last panel of Fig.4B into Fig. S1. The both graphs are
identical then readers need not duplication. My comment in the previous report meant that it will
be helpful if a part of the graph, for example, that of time=8650-8800, is magnified to be able to
capture the process toward phase locking.
(Page 7, line 184)
The authors termed the function as ``Dirac delta function’’. It is, however, this is not accurate
expression because delta=infinity when theta=0 in Dirac delta function. On the other hand their
definition is delta=1 when theta=0, delta=0 otherwise.

Dear Prof. Kevin Padian and Associate Editor,
We are pleased to send you the revised version of our manuscript. We have made most of
the changes and corrections suggested by the reviewers. In addition, we have improved English of
our manuscript by using a professional English editing service of a native speaker according to the
comment of the first reviewer. A marked-up copy of the changes from the previous manuscript is also
attached as a different file. We appreciate all the comments and suggestions as they have greatly
improved the quality of our study.
As described in the responses to both reviewers, we found one mistake about a parameter
value. Namely, in the previous manuscript, it was stated that the parameter K_nm is fixed at 1.0 for
the simulation of a wireless sensor network. However, we carried out the simulation with a wrong
value of K_nm = 0.5. We are sorry for this mistake. For this revision, we have performed the
simulation with the correct value (i.e., K_nm = 1.0) and then have updated Figures 7, 8 and 9.
Subsequently, the figures look slightly different from the previous ones while the results and
conclusions hold.
We would like to thank again for the valuable comments, and wish that the revised
manuscript is now suitable for the publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Sincerely yours,

Comments to the Author(s):
Overall this paper is most interesting when considering the frogs and less so than the wireless
sensors. For the latter, I really think they need to compare it to some of the other methods. I have a
number of questions about the numerical methods, but those are largely minor issues. There are
some other points that need clarification and the paper needs to be edited by a native speaker.
I think you might also look at the papers by Belykh, Belykh and Hasler where synchrony was
analyzed as the topology changed.
Acknowledgement:
Thank you very much for your valuable comments. We updated the manuscript according to your
comments as shown below. We also appreciate your suggestion on the check by a native speaker.
We used a professional English editing service by a native speaker and modified English of our
manuscript.
In addition to the following modifications, we found one mistake about a parameter value in
the simulation of a wireless sensor network. Namely, in the previous manuscript, it was stated that
the parameter K_nm is fixed at 1.0 for the simulation. However, we carried out the simulation with a
wrong value of K_nm = 0.5. We are sorry for this mistake. For this revision, we have performed the
simulation with the correct value (i.e., K_nm = 1.0) and then have updated Figures 7, 8 and 9 of our
manuscript. Subsequently, the figures look slightly different from the previous ones while the
results and conclusions hold.
Revised Point:
We appreciate your comment on the comparison of the proposed model to alternative methods of
a wireless sensor network. The main features of the proposed model can be summarized as
follows: (1) neighboring nodes can avoid packet collision over a short time scale by alternating the
timing of data transmission, and (2) all the nodes collectively switch their states over a long time
scale, establishing high network connectivity while reducing network power consumption. Although
there are alternative methods on the avoidance of packet collision over a short time scale, we
could not find the methods realizing the second feature over a long time scale unfortunately.
Consequently, we consider that the comparison with alternative methods achieving both of the
above features is now difficult. In the updated manuscript, we explained these discussions on the
relevance of partially related methods over a short time scale as well as the novelty of the
proposed model over a long time scale (Lines 480-486 in page 18 (Summary of the proposed
model); Lines 487-491 in page 18 (The relevance with alternative methods over a short time
scale); Lines 509-515 in page 19 (The novelty of the proposed model over a long time scale)).
We also thank you for the comment on the study by Belykh et al. We agree that their studies
on the synchrony and network topology are related to our study. This is because the temporal
structures emerging from anti-phase synchronization of neighboring oscillators are also likely to be
affected by the change of network topology. We explain this point in the section of Conclusions and
Discussions with citing the studies of Belykh et al. (Lines 501-508 in page 19).
Minor points (some less minor than others)
Comment 1:
page 2 flock -> flocking
Revised Point:
We modified the word "flock" in the introduction to "flocking" according to your comment (Line 30 in
page 2). In addition, we found the same word in the abstract, so we also modified it (Line 13 in
page 1).
Comment 2:
page 3 to -> over
Revised Point:
Thank you for the comment. In page 3 of the previous manuscript, however, there were multiple
"to" and we could not figure out which one should be modified. So, we ask a native speaker of a
professional English editing service to check our manuscript. However, the native speaker did not
point out that any of the multiple "to" in the page 3 should be modified. Hence, we could not modify
the word in this revision.
Comment 3:
page 7 In equation 2,3 you mean each time the phase hits 0 mod 2 pi the energy is decremented by
1 and the fatigue incremental by 1, correct? This should be stated explicitly since delta(x) means
transversal crossing at x=0 and this is not the case here
Revised Point:
Thank you for the comment. Yes, our model assumes that E_n is decreminted by 1 and T_n is
incremented by 1 each time the phase hits 0. Because this calculation is not the usual case of the
Dirac delta function as you point out, we add the above explanation to our manuscript (Lines
190-193 in page 7).
Comment 4:
page 10 In your earlier PRE paper you used sin(x) + c sin(2x) in order to get clusters as well as the
triphase state. Is there a reason you don’t use that in this paper since that seems to be what the frogs
do
Revised Point:
Thank you for the comment. In the previous manuscript, we assumed the interaction term K_nm
sin(theta_n-theta_m) as a simple function that can explain tri-phase synchronization of three frogs
(Aihara et al., Mathematical Biosciences, 2008). However, 1:2 anti-phase synchronization of three
frogs (i.e., two pairs of three frogs call alternately while the rest pair overlap their calls) is also
observed in the chorus of actual male Japanese tree frogs as you point out (see Figure 1D), and
then the interaction term of K_nm [sin(theta_n-theta_m)-k sin(2(theta_n-theta_m))] can reproduce
both 1:2 anti-phase synchronization and tri-phase synchronization at the same parameter values
(Aihara et al., Phy Rev E, 2011). Hence, we agree that the latter interaction term including the
second-order component is better for the model of frog choruses.
For this revision, we have redone all the simulations by using the interaction term including
the second-order component (i.e., K_nm [sin(theta_n-theta_m)-k sin(2(theta_n-theta_m))]) on the
assumption of the pulse coupling that you point out in Comment 7 (see Equations (1) and (13)).
Then, we have updated Figures 4 and 5. Consequently, the tri-phase synchronization and the 1:2
anti-phase synchronization occur at a different chorus in the same simulation (see the bottom
panel of Figure 4B and also Figure S1 in Supplementary Information). We consider that these
results reproduce the temporal patterns of frog choruses much more precisely. Thank you very
much again for the valuable comment that has greatly improved the quality of our study.
Comment 5:
page 11 It seems like you synchronously evaluate the prob of switching every 3.5 seconds. This is
a correct numerical implementation. I would think it should be more like a voltage gated ion channel
where the rate of transition depends on the fatigue etc. this seems like a strange update rule. The
right way would be to take the probability and divide by 3.5 to get a rate R and then if h is the time
step for the ode model, at each such time step, choose a uniform random number, x, between 0 and
1. If x< h R then make the transition. This is the proper approximation if you are assuming a cts
markov process.
Revised Point:
Thank you for the comment. As you point out, we evaluate the probability of the transition every 3.5
seconds. In other words, we treat the transition as a discrete-time Markov process. The reason of
this treatment is the discontinuity in the probability of the transition. As shown in Equations (7) and
(8), the probability of the transition from the calling state to the silent state depends on the fatigue
(T_n). Then, the time evolution of T_n during the calling state is described by the Dirac delta
function (Equation (2)). Therefore, the fatigue T_n changes discretely in time, and then the
probability of the transition also changes discretely in time.
To evaluate the probability of the transition (P) as a continuous-time Markov process, we
recognize that the following steps are necessary: (1) we calculate the time differential of the
probability of the transition (P'), and (2) we update the state according to the rate of the transition
(i.e., P' * h) by using the time step h of the simulation. In this study, however, the probability of the
transition is discontinuous in time as explained above, so that we cannot calculate the time
differential of the probability (i.e., P'). Subsequently, we treat the transition as a discrete-time
Markov process which is an alternative approach of a continuous-time Markov process. We add
these explanations to the manuscript (Lines 293-300 in pages 11 and 12).
Comment 6:
page 12
When the animal switches to the call state is the phase the same as it was when it left the call state in
the previous bout? This seems unrealistic that it would recall the phase. Seems more likely it starts
randomly or at 0
Revised Point:
Thanks for the comment. Actually, in the simulation of the previous manuscript, we randomized the
phase from 0 to 2pi at each transition from the silent state to the calling state. We are sorry that the
manuscript lacked this information. We add the explanation about the randomization of the phase
to the manuscript (Lines 305-306 in page 12).
Comment 7:
page 14
So the theta_m inside Gamma makes no difference and this is the Winfree pulse coupled model. It
would seem that this model would also be better for the frogs since they don’t interact continuously
but rather only when the other is calling. I understand that the cts interaction you guys show can
come from weak coupling, but it would be better to be consistent in your modeling
Revised Point:
We agree with your comment. As you point out, the calls of male Japanese tree frogs have a
specific duration (Figure 1), indicating that they do not continuously interact. For this revision, we
carried out the simulation by assuming the Dirac delta function also in the model of frog choruses
(Equation (1)) and updated Figures 4 and 5. Consequently, we succeeded in reproducing the
alternating chorus patterns of male Japanese tree frogs as in the case of the continuous interaction.
Note that in the updated simulation we assume a slightly weaker interaction (K_nm = 0.2) than the
previous case of the continuous interaction (K_nm = 1.0) so as to obtain the consistent result from
the simulation.
Comment 8:
page 15
Instead or requiring the reader to figure out that sqrt(2) means talk to the 6 neighbors, just say it is a
Moore neighborhood or say the 6 immediate neighbors
Revised Point:
We agree. In the updated manuscript, we first explain that we assume the situation in which each
node interacts with a Moore neighborhood, and then provide an additional information explaining
that such an interaction can be realized by a specific parameter value (Lines 377-379 in pages14
and 15).
Comment 9:
Eq15 is discontinuous at 0 and 2pi. It should be cts there like the sine model
Revised Point:
Thank you for the comment. As you point out, we use a linear interaction term (Equation (14) that
corresponds to Equation (15) in the previous manuscript) that is discontinuous at 0 and 2pi. This is
because it is required to avoid a packet collision (i.e., in-phase synchronization) as quickly as
possible in a wireless sensor network. Although the sinusoidal interaction term can make the
in-phase synchronization to be unstable, it takes much long time for the nodes to avoid the
in-phase synchronization because of a very weak interaction near the in-phase synchronization
(see Figure S2A in Supplementary Information). By contrast, the linear interaction term produces a
strong interaction even at the in-phase synchronization: namely, the linear term takes a large
positive value at 0 and takes a large negative value at 2pi (see Figure S2B in Supplementary
Information), which allows sensor nodes to avoid the in-phase synchronization very quickly.
Therefore, we use the linear interaction term for the model of a wireless sensor network in this
study although such a discontinuous function is not usually utilized for the model of a
continuous-time system. We add this explanation to our manuscript (Lines 387-395 in page 15).
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s):
The authors investigated calling behavior of two or three frogs and found a group of frogs
self-organizes their calling behavior in two different time scale; in short time scale, individual frog
calls alternatively from the other frogs; in log time scale, a group of frogs switches between
alternative calling state and silent state. The authors modeled these two behaviors using a
coupled-oscillator system additionally introduced stochastic state switching mechanism. Last, the
mechanism of this behavior was applied to a wireless sensor network problem.
Their findings of the two hierarchical behavior of the frog is interesting, and the idea of the application
is fine. It is, however, the paper leaves room for improvement as listed below.
Acknowledgement:
Thank you very much for your valuable comments. We updated the manuscript according to your
comments as follows. The dynamical behaviors of various animals attract a great deal of attention
from many researchers, and various experimental and theoretical studies were carried out. To our
knowledge, however, the hierarchical feature of the animal behavior was not studied well
especially from the viewpoint of mathematical modeling. We hope that this study will highlight the
unique behavior of male frogs and also inspire further studies on bio-inspired technologies.
In addition to the following modifications, we found one mistake about a parameter value in
the previous manuscript. Namely, in the simulation of a wireless sensor network, it was stated that
the parameter K_nm is fixed at 1.0. However, we carried out the simulation with a wrong value of
K_nm = 0.5. We are sorry for this mistake. For this revision, we have performed the simulation with
the correct value (i.e., K_nm = 1.0) and then have updated Figures 7, 8 and 9 of our manuscript.
Consequently, the figures look slightly different from the previous ones while the results and
conclusions hold.
Main points
Comment 1:
It is fine they succeeded in modeling of the frog behavior and found the silent state is useful for
energy saving. So, how the efficiency depends on the parameters, especially on the coupling
strength (K), the detection sensitivity of calling neighbors (H)? This kind of analysis would give a
benefit in design of wireless sensor networks. The variable, energy E is not so important in the
dynamics, if the author do not analyze the efficiency.
Revised Point:
Thank you very much for the valuable comment. We agree with you. To evaluate the efficacy of
energy saving in a wireless sensor network, we need to examine how the dynamics of E_n is
affected by the parameters of our model. Hence, we newly define the pace of power consumption
(t_pow) and then examine how t_pow depends on the parameters of our model (Note that t_pow is
defined as the time in which the remaining power of all the nodes becomes less than 90% of their
maximum power E_max (Lines 442-447 in page 17)). Consequently, we found that the parameter
alpha in Equation (5) dominantly affects the efficacy of energy saving.
Figure 9B shows the relationship between alpha and t_pow. This figure demonstrates that it
takes a longer time for sensor nodes to consume their energy if the parameter alpha takes a
smaller value, indicating that we can control network lifetime by the parameter alpha. The origin of
this result is that alpha represents the recovery rate of T_n (Equation (5)) and therefore determines
the duration of the sleep state. We added these new analysis and result to our manuscript (Lines
442-451 in page 17).
In addition, we examine how t_pow depends on the parameters K and p_high according to
your comment (Note that p_high is the parameter included in the function H (see Equation (12))
and represents the sensitivity of response to the signals from other nodes). The results of these
analyses are shown in Figures S4 in Supplementary Information. In both figures, the range of the
vertical axe is set at the same value with Figure 9B. It is demonstrated that these two parameters
do not strongly affect t_pow compared to the parameter alpha. We guess that the reasons of these
results are as follows: (1) the parameter K just slightly modulates an inter-signal interval of an
active node and therefore does not have a strong effect on the duration of the active state, and (2)
the parameter p_high mainly determines the occurrence of the collective transition but does not
modulate the duration of each state.
Comment 2:
The proposed model is for just two or three frogs, while the number of units in the wireless sensor
network is more than those up to 100. Why they did not construct a model of nearest (or second
nearest) neighbor coupling system for the frog system (They did it in their previous work ref[23]).
Revised Point:
Thank you for the comment. In the section of frog choruses, this study aims to propose a
mathematical model that can reproduce the features of empirical data over multiple time scales. To
precisely examine the validity of the proposed model, we need larger datasets of empirical data.
The reason of our restriction on the number of frogs (i.e., two frogs or three frogs) is the difference
of the data size between indoor experiments and field observations. Namely, the data of our indoor
experiments consists of the audio recordings of 16 hours (4 hours * 4 datasets; Aihara et al., Phy
Rev E, 2011) while the data of our field observations consist of the video recordings of 1.25 hours
(15 min * 5 datasets; Aihara et al., Sci Rep, 2014). Therefore, the datasets of field observations are
currently much smaller than those of indoor experiments, and then we focus on the system of two
frogs or three frogs in this manuscript so as to utilize the larger datasets of the indoor experiments.
We add this explanation to our manuscript (Lines 466-472 in page18).
On the other hand, it remains as a future problem to extend the proposed model to a system
of many frogs. Especially, in our previous study (Aihara et al., Sci Rep, 2014), we consider the
interaction that decays depending on the distance among frogs; such a network topology should
affect the temporal structures also in the proposed model. It is very interesting for us to examine
the relationship between the network topology and the temporal chorus pattern on the basis of
such an extended model with many frogs. In regard to this point, it is also an important future
problem to investigate the relationship between the network topology and the temporal structures
in a wireless sensor network because we here consider specific network topology shown in Figure
7A (i.e., a two-dimensional square lattice in which each node interacts with a Moore neighborhood)
although such a network topology should vary a lot in the practical usage of a wireless sensor
network. We also add these discussions to our manuscript (Lines 473-479 in page 18; Lines
501-508 in page 19).
Comment 3:
Most part of the basic idea has been already proposed in the reference [33] written by one of the
authors of this submitted paper. This work should be introduced in the introduction part and the
authors should present what is the main novel point of this paper differently from the previous one.
Revised Point:
Thank you very much for the valuable comment. As you point out, Mutazono et al. carried out a
seminal work on the application of frog choruses to a wireless sensor network (Mutazono et al.,
Computer Communications, 2012). We agree that their study should be cited in the introduction
and then the novel point of our study should be explained.
As for the dynamics over a short time scale, Mutazono et al. also use a phase oscillator
model so as to avoid a packet collision among sensor nodes. Namely, they propose a phase
oscillator model with citing our theoretical study on frog choruses (Aihara et al., Artificial Life and
Robotics, 2008), and then apply the model to the control of a wireless sensor network. Therefore,
the study of Mutazono et al. is the first one that reports the application of the short-time-scale
dynamics of frog choruses (i.e., anti-phase synchronization of two frogs) to the control of a wireless
sensor network.
By contrast, we consider that this study proposes a novel approach on the dynamics over a
long time scale. The point is that Mutazono et al. utilize the satellite behavior of male frogs to
reduce network power consumption. The satellite behavior is the behavior that male frogs stay
silent in the vicinity of a calling male for a tremendously long time in order to intercept a female that
is attracted to the calling male (Gerhardt and Huber 2002; Wells 2007), which can be understood
as an inhibitory interaction among male frogs that inhibits the calling behavior of neighboring males.
In this study, we do not assume the satellite behavior of male frogs at all for the modeling of frog
choruses. By contrast, we here focus on the collective and cyclic transition between the silent state
and the calling state, and model the transition by using an excitatory interaction among male frogs
that activate the calling behavior of neighboring males (Equation (12)). Because Mutazono et al. do
not focus on the collective and cyclic transition and then do not reproduce it by their model, we
consider that this study provides a novel approach for the dynamics over a long time scale.
We add these explanations to the introduction (Lines 72-85 in page 3).
Minor points
Comment 1:
The names of axes G1(Tn) and G2(Tn) in Fig. 3 are inconsistent with the explanation of Eq. (7,8) and
Eq. (10); They are exchanged.
Revised Point:
Thank you very much for the comment. As you point out, G1(Tn) and G2(Tn) in Figure 3 of the
previous manuscript should be G2(Tn) and G1(Tn), respectively. We are so sorry for this mistake.
We modified the names of the axes according to your comment (see Figure 3 in the updated
manuscript).
Comment 2:
In Fig. 4B, last panel, it is difficult to find the feature of the tri-phase. How about the different
combination of the data are colored different? The same problem is found in Fig. 7C, in which the
partial magnified graph will be helpful for readers.
Revised Point:
We agree with you. According to the comment, we update the bottom panel of Figure 4B by using
color plots in which pink dots, blue dots and green dots represent theta_1-theta_2, theta_1-theta_3
and theta_2-theta_3, respectively. Then, we also add the enlarged version of this figure as
Supplementary Information so as to clearly show the details of the phase dynamics (see Figure S1
in Supplementary Information).
We also appreciate for your comment on Figure 7C. We show the enlarged version of Figure
7C in Supplementary Information (see Figure S3). We agree that this figure is helpful for readers.
However, we could not find a specific temporal pattern in the phase dynamics. The reason of this
complicated pattern would be the frustration emerging from anti-phase synchronization of
neighboring oscillators. In our previous study (Aihara et al., Sci. Rep., 2014), we showed that
several synchronization states (i.e., two-cluster synchronization and wavy anti-phase
synchronization with various wave numbers) are multi-stable even in a simple spatial structure of a
ring when assuming oscillators that attempt to synchronize in anti-phase with neighbors. The point
is that in this study we assume a more complicated spatial structure (i.e., a two-dimensional
square lattice in which each oscillator interacts with a Moore neighborhood) than a ring. Therefore,
a more complicated pattern is likely to emerge in this simulation. We consider that further analysis
is required to reveal the details of the complicated pattern. We add this explanation to our
manuscript (Lines 491-501 in pages 18 and 19).

Reviewer comments to Author
Review 1
<U+2713> Comment <U+270F>
Why is it called 1:2 synchronization? It remains 1:1 with each oscillator firing once per
cycle.
Also on page 4
If there are three frogs and two are synchronized, isn t there just 1 frog remaining? Instead
of rest pair , perhaps you mean remaining frog?
<U+2712> <U+2711>
Response:
Thank you very much for the comment. 1:2 anti-phase synchronization means that one frog
synchronizes in anti-phase with the remaining two frogs that synchronize in in-phase (as you
point out, this is the same with the state in which two frogs synchronize in in-phase, and they
synchronize in anti-phase with the remaining frog). In the previous manuscript, we explained
this situation based on the synchronized state of each pair, but we consider that the explanation
was very confusing. Therefore, we modified the explanation of 1:2 anti-phase synchronization
according to your comment (Line 105 in Page 4).
In addition, the phrase of 1:2 anti-phase synchronization seems to be also confusing for de-
scribing this state because each oscillator fires once per cycle as you point out. Therefore, we
modified the phrase of 1:2 anti-phase synchronization to clustered anti-phase synchronization
(Line 106 in Page 4, Line 323 in Page 12, the caption of Figure 1, the caption of Figure 4, and
the caption of Figure S1 in Supplementary Information) so as to precisely describe the situa-
tion that one frog synchronizes in anti-phase with the remaining two frogs that synchronize in
in-phase. Thank you very much again for your valuable comment.

Review 2
<U+2713> General Comment <U+270F>
Most of my concerns have been addressed except for the followin minor points:
<U+2712> <U+2711>
Acknowledgement:
Thank you very much for your valuable comments. We revised our manuscript as follows.
<U+2713> Comment 1 <U+270F>
(Answer to my major comment 1)
The authors added a new measure tpow to capture dependence of system behavior on pa-
rameters alpha, Knm , and phigh . For Knm , they examine on the domain Knm >= 0.5. How
about Knm < 0.5? Relating to this, in page 10, line 258, they describe the parameter setting
as Knm = 0.20. In contrast they stated, in their rebuttal document, that performed the
simulation with the correct value (i.e., Knm = 1.0). Please correct the conflict.
<U+2712> <U+2711>
Response:
Thank you for the comment. In this study, we use different types of interaction terms as well
as their coupling strengths for the simulations of frog choruses and a wireless sensor network.
For the simulation of frog choruses, we use a sinusoidal interaction term of Equation (13) with
the coupling strength of Knm = 0.2 (Line 265 in Page 10 in the current manuscript). In contrast,
for the simulation of a wireless sensor network, we use a linear interaction term of Equation (14)
with the coupling strength of Knm = 1.0 (Line 404 in Page 15). In the rebuttal document of our
previous submission, we stated our previous mistake about the simulation of a wireless sensor
network as follows:
<U+2713> Rebuttal document of our previous submission <U+270F>
In addition to the following modifications, we found one mistake about a parameter value
in the previous manuscript. Namely, in the simulation of a wireless sensor network, it was
stated that the parameter Knm is fixed at 1.0. However, we carried out the simulation with
a wrong value of Knm = 0.5. We are sorry for this mistake. For this revision, we have
performed the simulation with the correct value (i.e., Knm = 1.0) and then have updated
Figures 7, 8 and 9 of our manuscript. Consequently, the figures look slightly different from
the previous ones while the results and conclusions hold.”
<U+2712> <U+2711>
This statement explains that we used a correct value for the simulation of frog choruses (i.e.,
Knm = 0.2; Line 265 in Page 10) but used a wrong value for the simulation of a wireless sensor
network (i.e., we used Knm = 0.5 although the correct value is Knm = 1.0 as explained in Line
404 in Page 15). We are sorry for the confusing explanation about the parameter values. We
are sure that all the simulations have been carried out with the correct values in the current
manuscript.
On the other hand, we agree that the simulation in a wider parameter range is quite important.
In this revision, we carried out the same simulation in a wider range of 0 <= Knm < 1.5 that
includes the range of Knm < 0.5. According to the simulation, we updated Figure S4A in the
Supplementary Information. Thank you very much again for the valuable comment.
<U+2713> Comment 2 <U+270F>
(Answer to my minor comment 2)
They added an enlarged graph of the last panel of Fig.4B into Fig. S1. The both graphs are
identical then readers need not duplication. My comment in the previous report meant that
it will be helpful if a part of the graph, for example, that of time= 8650-8800, is magnified
to be able to capture the process toward phase locking.
<U+2712> <U+2711>
Response:
Thank you very much for the comment. We are sorry that we misunderstood your comment
in our rebuttal document of the previous submission. We agree that the graph enlarged in the
axe of time is much helpful for readers because the bottom panel of Figure 4B includes several
choruses in the same graph. The point of this simulation is that we succeed in reproducing both
of the tri-phase synchronization and clustered anti-phase synchronization that were reported
in our previous experiments of Ref. [12] (Note that we have changed the word 1:2 anti-
phase synchronization” to clustered anti-phase synchronization” as explained in our response
to the comment of the other reviewer). In this revision, we added two enlarged graphs that
show the process toward phase locking at clustered anti-phase synchronization and tri-phase
synchronization, respectively (see Figure S1A and S1B in Supplementary Information). Note
that, before and after the chorus of three frogs, there are short periods in which only two frogs
make a chorus; in those period, a phase difference converges to p (i.e, anti-phase synchronization
of two frogs is realized).
<U+2713> Comment 3 <U+270F>
(Page 7, line 184)
The authors termed the function as “Dirac delta function”. It is, however, this is not
accurate expression because delta=infinity when theta= 0 in Dirac delta function. On the
other hand their definition is delta= 1 when theta= 0, delta= 0 otherwise.
<U+2712> <U+2711>
Response:
Thank you for the comment. In this study, we assume a delta function d(<U+03B8>n (t)) that is infinity
at <U+03B8>n = 0 and is 0 otherwise. Then, we also assume that d(<U+03B8>n (t)) satisfies the relationship
R tn,i +o
tn,i -o d(<U+03B8>n (t))dt = 1 for the call timing t = tn,i (Here, i represents the index of calls produced
by the nth frog, and o is a small positive parameter). The purpose of this assumption is to
propose a time differential equation in which the variables of En and Tn change discretely in
time when the focal frog produces a call at <U+03B8>n = 0. This delta function gives the deviations
R tn,i +o dTn R tn,i +o
of Tn and En at the call timing t = tn,i as <U+2206>Tn = tn,i -o dt dt = tn,i -o d(<U+03B8>n (t)) = 1 and
R tn,i +o dEn R tn,i +o
<U+2206>En = tn,i -o dt dt = tn,i -o (-d(<U+03B8>n (t)))dt = -1. Consequently, our model can describe the
situation in which Tn is incremented by 1 and En is decremented by 1 every time the phase <U+03B8>n
hits 0. In the revised manuscript, we added the explanation of the delta function d(<U+03B8>n ) (Lines
187-190 in Page 7, and Lines 195-200 in Pages 7 and 8).
However, the delta function assumed here is slightly different from the Dirac delta function
R x +o
dDirac (<U+03B8>n (t)). This is because the Dirac delta function satisfies the relationship x00-o dDirac (x -
1
x0 )dx = 1 and also satisfies the relationship dDirac (f (x)) = f ' (x=x0 ) dDirac (x - x0 ) if f (x) is zero
at x0 . If we use the Dirac delta function in our model, the deviation of En at t = tn,i is given
R tn,i +o dEn R tn,i +o R tn,i +o 1
by <U+2206>En = tn,i -o dt dt = tn,i -o (-dDirac (<U+03B8> n (t)))dt = tn,i -o (- <U+03B8>n ' (t=t
n,i )
dDirac (t - tn,i ))dt =
1
R tn,i +o 1
- <U+03B8>' (t=tn,i ) tn,i -o
dDirac (t - tn,i )dt = - <U+03B8>' (t=t n,i )
, which is different from the result obtained from
n n
the above delta function. Therefore, we do not use the word “the Dirac delta function” in
the revised manuscript. Moreover, we briefly mention that the delta function assumed here is
different from the Dirac delta function, so as to avoid the confusion of readers (Lines 190-192 in
Page 7). Thank you very much again for the valuable comment.
