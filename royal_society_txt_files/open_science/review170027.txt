General Comments
Overall the paper was well-written and I found no major thematic or grammatical errors. The
study aimed to explore if variation in lionfish density, body condition, diet, and behavior can be
attributed to change in depth and fishing intensity. The authors concluded that there were
significant changes in fish density, condition, and behavior between shallow and deep reefs, but
not in lionfish diet. The authors also concluded that un-culled mesophotic lionfish exhibited
higher alert distances compared to lionfish from shallow culled or un-culled reefs.
The study design outlined in the manuscript is a bit unclear. It seems as if a factorial experimental
design was attempted to explore effects of both depth and fishing intensity. If this is correct, an
ideal balanced design would include samples collected from the follow site-types:
1. shallow, un-culled reef
2. shallow, culled reef
3. deep, un-culled reef
4. deep, culled reef
From the way in which data are currently presented, it does not seem that there is sufficient
balance in the experiment to draw the conclusions described. It could be feasible that the
differences found in response variables could be due to differences in geography, rather than
depth or fishing.
As the paper stands now, it seems like the foundation of the manuscript relies on the distinction
between a ‘culled reef’ and ‘non-culled reef’, yet, there was little discussion how these categories
were determined. The effects of culling on lionfish density, behavior, and condition are not well-
supported, as the methods and analyses are very vague. Although there was mention of surveys
and collections conducted in Tela Bay, no data were presented.
Presentation of the results section is a bit lacking. There’s much emphasis placed on the culled vs
non-culled comparison, yet there is little no discussion in the results about this analysis. Data
source (survey data or collections data) needs to be more clear in all figures and conclusions. See
Results section for more specific comments.
The strength of the paper lies in the support for ontogenetic shifts and depth refuge from
management efforts. I think the claim that MCE act as a refuge from culling is unsupported with
this dataset, as it is presented in its current form. I’d recommend revising the introduction,
discussion, and conclusion to be more candid about the limitations of the data, as there are many.
The reviewer recommends that the paper be restructured to clarify the study design and
hypotheses to ensure a balanced experimental design.
Methods
[line 181] Change the section title to something more descriptive of the metric being analyzed for
consistency with other section titles. For example, “Lionfish Condition and Diet”, or “Condition
and Feeding” for consistency with Discussion section.

[line 185] ESM 2 refers to a Table, but no table number is included or supplemental file name. It
may be topical to include histograms of the distribution of lionfish size and across depth
categories, as well as sample size.
Results & Analyses
Authors should refer to the “Statement of good statistical practice” available online to expand on
the statistical methods section. For example, a sentence stating whether the assumptions of an
ANOVA were met should be included.
All figures should have the units in parentheses, not after a ‘/’.
Figure 1 might be improved if there was a visual cue to distinguish culled and non-culled sites.
Perhaps, another panel could be added showing the locations of speared lionfish used for
Condition and Diet analyses would be useful? Especially since there were no lionfish found <40m
at locations in Figure 1. Finally, I’d be more clear in the caption in regards to the data source for
each panel.
Figure 4D. NMDS plot should show all data points, not one cumulative or mean value for each
depth band.
As mentioned above, I’d like to see a distribution of data for lionfish collected via spearfishermen,
both in terms of distribution of data density themselves and lionfish density per depth. I’m
interested to see if the data are normally distributed within each depth category and how variable
the groups are (homoscedastic?) and in terms of group size. It seems unlikely from the collection
methods that a simple ANOVA would suffice, rather than utilizing a resampling approach to
handle non-normally distributed data.
Discussion
[line 340] Need to clarify that this conclusion is only based on collection data, not on the actual
density surveys.
[line 345] It’s hard to make any claims about MCEs being a refuge from culling since there was no
clarification as to where culling locations were. This is only possibility, but by no means is this
dataset suggestive of a refuge. This could purely be an ontogenetic shift, part of the fish’s biology.
[line 357] This statement might be better supported if the collections data were presented. It
seems unlikely that this is true, unless the 2016 collections data also showed low to no lionfish
present in shallows.

showing distribution of data across depth.
ESM 3: Add title or description. Unclear what data represent.

of data described is for the NMDS analysis.

The authors incorporated all suggested edits from reviewers sufficiently. The area of greatest
concern was the issue of an unbalanced design and overstating conclusions about ontogenetic
shifts in invasive lionfish. Although ontogenetic shifts are a probable cause for patterns seen in
density data and fish body condition, it is important to include relevant discussion of other

Appendix A
Review of "Testing depth refuges and ontogenetic migrations in invasive lionfish- do
mesophotic lionfish populatios undermine current management?" for Royal Society
Open Science:
Overview
The authors survey lionfish size, maturity, and density on shallow and mesophotic reefs around Utila
(where culling takes place regularly) and on shallow reefs in Tela Bay. They also measure ‘reaction
distance’ for lionfish encountered in each region (at shallow depths in Tela Bay, and across depths in
Utila). The authors find that lionfish are larger, more mature, and more abundant on mesophotic
reefs compared with shallow sites in Utila. Stomach analysis of lionfish revealed they were primarily
consuming fish prey. They also find that the reaction distance of lionfish was significantly different
between the two regions they studied (Utila and Tela Bay), and did not vary with depth in Utila.
Major comments
This study addresses a topic of interest for invasive lionfish management. In general I found the
manuscript to be well written and clearly organized. The authors’ work provides some interesting
insights about the effects of culling on the depth distribution of invasive lionfish around Utila.
Differences in size (and therefore maturity) and density between depths around Utila are consistent
with an effect of fishing out adults at shallow depths, and the number of captured fish from shallow
versus deep areas supports culling as a driver of this pattern. In my opinion, this is the strongest
aspect of the analysis.
However, there are several places where the authors have overextend the inferences they can make
about lionfish ontogenetic habitat use and movement given their study design. While insights from
diet and behavior could be useful indirect lines of evidence, key elements of these data sets are
missing that are needed to evaluate patterns of recruitment and movement between habitats. In
particular, because the ‘non-culling’ area (Tela Bay) does not share the same depth stratification as
the ‘culled’ areas (Utila), it is not possible to know whether differences in lionfish reaction distance
between the two regions are truly due to ‘escape’ from culling and move deep, or some other site-
specific differences. A robust test would examine multiple culled and un-culled sites, all consisting of
shallow and deep habitats, to evaluate the behaviour of lionfish in deep habitats that are adjacent in
un-culled sites. Without this information, the authors’ conclusions are tenuous at best and need to
have appropriate caveats added about the design and other possible mechanisms at play (see
detailed comments).
In addition, diet composition data on its own does not inform our understanding of where lionfish
have been feeding at such a fine spatial scale. To get at habitat use, the authors would need
information on the availability of prey to lionfish by each depth band, in order to evaluate what we
as being consumed versus available. Assuming that differences in species composition by depth is
greater than variation across sites (which is not clear from this MS), they may be able to ascertain
whether deep lionfish were consuming shallow prey more frequently than expected, or vice versa.
This result would provide some indirect evidence for recent movement between habitats (at least,
over the time scale needed to digest prey). However, an absence of diet items from other habitat
types does not prove that the individual has not been moving between habitats, because this
pattern may have been missed depending on the relative timing of feeding, digestion, and
movement. Lionfish also are known to consume prey selectively, which may affect patterns of
resource use (see Green and Côté 2014). At a minimum, these considerations and caveats needs to
be addressed in the discussion.
Specific comments
Line 1: The title is not an accurate reflections of the scope of key findings in this MS (there is not
enough evidence to disentangle whether ontogenetic migration or movement is occurring). Please
revise to “Depth-dependent effects of culling on invasive lionfish population density, size, and
behavior” or similar.
Line 42-44: How did lionfish size and maturity compare between shallow sites in Utila and Tela Bay?
Line 48-49: See my comments and the stomach contents analysis. This statement is misleading, as
you may expect that fishes would dominate the diet at all depths depending on what is available.
Lines 49-53: I don’t see how your results at all provide evidence for ontogenetic migration. What I
take way from this is that culling affects the size and density of lionfish on shallow sites. Without
information on the behaviour of lionfish from deep habitats adjacent to un-culled shallow zones, this
link is very tenuous and I would remove it from the abstract.
Lines 90-91: But you cite multiple studies with conflicting patterns of size depending on location
throughout the paragraph. I would remove this sentence, and start this section with ‘The extent to
which lionfish in the invaded Caribbean exhibit habitat specific recruitment and ontogenetic
migration between habitats is unclear.”
Line 112: These two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, because lionfish culling on shallow sites
will likely reduce the average size (and therefore fecundity) of individuals compared to MCE fish.
Make this explicit and revise to “and/or”.
Lines 144-162: This section needs to make it clear that not all of the same data were collected on
Utila and Tela Bay (only behaviour, not density/size surveys and stomach contents- these were
collected for Utila only, correct?)
Line 166: Make it clear that the surveys were conducted on Utila (not Tela Bay).
Lines 166-179: Green et al. 2013 (Coral Reefs) show that transect surveys greatly underestimate
lionfish density, and the bias depends on habitat and fish size. I would imagine that video surveys
suffer from this same limitation. Given that readers will be relaying your density information in
successive literature on the invasion, I think this bias is important to consider and incorporate into
your measures of density (Figure 2) and in the Discussion.
Line 187: How many lionfish were collected from each depth? Given the total number of samples,
and samples by depth band here.
Lines 205-219: The authors need to provide more information on the state of other variables known
to affect lionfish behavior, including the time of day that observations were conducted (light levels
and in situ behavior affect fish reactions; i.e. whether they are resting or active), the structural
complexity of habitats between locations, which would affect the ease with which lionfish are able
to escape approaches- was this the same between the two regions?
Lines 226-239: As is, this analysis really doesn’t tell us much about the spatial distribution of diet
composition with only three points. Are you able to divide fish by the site they were captured at, in
addition to depth band? Given that size has a large effect on diet composition, the analysis would
provide more ecological insights if you divided the stomach samples by the size of lionfish (perhaps
by 5cm size bins), and then constructing your ordination using a combination of point colour and
shape to represent depth/size.
Lines 242-251: I would image that the activity the lionfish is engaged in while the diver is
approaching may also influence reaction distance. If it’s available, I think it would be very important
to include information on lionfish behaviour at the time the reaction distance measurement was into
the model.
Lines 275-287: The way that gonad stage is treated statistically is not correct; stage is not a
continuous variable (i.e. you cannot have stage 2.5). For females, I would suggest presenting these
data simply as proportions that were mature for each size class and by depth. I would remove
reference to male gonad ‘stage’ all together, as this is very difficult to assess visually, whereas
weight is easy to measure accurately, for this sex.
Lines 275-279: You would expect that larger fish and have larger gonads, so this result is not
surprising. What would be really interesting is to see whether there are any differences in the ratio
of gonad:body weight. This would reveal whether lionfish were more mature, for a given size, at
depth.
Lines 281-287:
Lines 303-304: This is an interesting result!
Lines 305-206: Give the proportion of stomachs that contained identifiable prey, and the sample size
of lionfish that were dissected.
Lines 318-320: Remove “implying that there is more similarity between fish families…”. This is an
interpretative statement that should be saved for the Conclusion, and warrants more discussion
than given here.
Lines 327-336: How many lionfish did you observe in each depth per location? This is key
information needed to evaluate how robust your results are.
Line 323: I’m not following your statement “…suggesting at the two sites lionfish alert distance did
not change with depth”. Which two sites are you referring to? As I understand it, you did not
measure lionfish behavior on deep habitats in Tela Bay (only shallow sites), and so cannot speak to
changes in behaviour with depth there.
Lines 343-344: See my comment about evaluating gonad:body size. It’s not surprising that you found
more mature/larger gonads given that fish were larger.
Lines 350-353: I disagree that your results support ontogenetic migrations as the primary
mechanism. They support an effect of culling on size and density, but with no scientific control (i.e.
behavior of MCE lionfish adjacent to unculled reefs) and replication, the line of evidence is
incomplete. It’s important to acknowledge these caveats, as well as discuss other mechanisms that
may be influence behaviour between the locations and depths (habitat complexity, fish size,
conspecific density, fish behaviour at the time of the measurement, light levels).
Lines 356-370: Add discussion on bias in estimating method.
Line 375-391, and 400-413: These sections greatly overstep the conclusions that can be supported
with the information in this study. The observed patterns of size and maturity are explained just as
well by the effect of culling on lionfish size (and therefore life stage/gonad weight). These two
explanations needs to be given equal weight here, as the effect of culling is not disentangled from
ontogeny in this study.
Lines 423-430: Need to also acknowledge the limitations of your design, and other mechanisms that
could be responsible (see my comment above).
Lines 453-480: Diet may reflect what is available by depth to some degree, but is also a reflection of
selectivity (i.e. Green and Côté 2014) which affects your ability to detect patterns of resource use
from diet data alone.
Lines 471-475: See comments about about including lionfish size in the MDS analysis.
Lines 482-522- This a well written and thoughtful discussion on options for MCE lionfish
management.
Lines 528529- See comments above about maturity/gonad weight relative to body size above. Either
add “due to their increased size”, or provide information on whether gonad weight is greater for
MCE when controlling for lionfish weigh (i.e. proportion of body mass).
Figure 1. The black dot in the inset of Figure 1A indicating the study region should be an un-filled
rectangle around the study region to be consistent. I would recommend zooming in on the region
map so that you can see the region a little more clearly. Reduce Tela and Utila label size; add
rectangular outlines around each of these sub regions where you did the surveys.
Figure 2: Y-axis label on A: “Density (lionfish 250m-2)”, change /m, /cm, /Kg to (m), (cm), (Kg) on axes
in both panels. Give number of samples (in A = sites (?) and in B/C = # individual lionfish) either in
the figure caption or in the figure above each bar.
Figure 3: See comments about analysing gonad stage; cannot have a half stage. Give information on
the proportion of lionfish in each stage per depth band. Need x axis labels on A, B, C panels. I would
remove panel B and keep this figure about gonad weight for males, given that it is very difficult to
assess male maturity visually. Change /g to (g). Given number of specimens (sample size) for each
depth by panel in the Figure caption or above bars in the plots.
Figure 4: Spell out ‘Proportion’, or change to %. Change /m to (m) in X axes. Give sample sizes for all

convinced that it adds much to the manuscript.
Table 1: I had a hard time interpreting this table, and I’m sure your other readers will too. In which
columns/rows does the proportion add up to 1? What are your sample sizes of stomach for each
depth band? Is this proportion by individual stomach, or pooled together for all lionfish in a depth
band?
Table 2: I have several questions about these results:
- How many lionfish did you observe in each region/depth zone? Given that very few lionfish
(and in some cases, none) were sighted on shallow Utila sites in your video surveys, do you
have a balanced design with this aspect of the paper?
- How could you test for an interaction between region and depth, when one of the two
regions did not have an MCE area?
- The significant effect of lionfish length is important for this manuscript (though the effect
size is small as it is for all effects), since you observed differences in lionfish size per depth
band and warrants more discussion in the manuscript.
- What are the units on the alert distance measurement here?

General Comments
1.1 Overall the paper was well-written and I found no major thematic or grammatical errors. The study
aimed to explore if variation in lionfish density, body condition, diet, and behavior can be attributed to
change in depth and fishing intensity. The authors concluded that there were significant changes in fish
density, condition, and behavior between shallow and deep reefs, but not in lionfish diet. The authors
also concluded that un-culled mesophotic lionfish exhibited higher alert distances compared to lionfish
from shallow culled or un-culled reefs.
Thank you.
1.2 The study design outlined in the manuscript is a bit unclear. It seems as if a factorial experimental
design was attempted to explore effects of both depth and fishing intensity. If this is correct, an ideal
balanced design would include samples collected from the follow site-types:
1. shallow, un-culled reef
2. shallow, culled reef
3. deep, un-culled reef
4. deep, culled reef
From the way in which data are currently presented, it does not seem that there is sufficient balance in
the experiment to draw the conclusions described. It could be feasible that the differences found in
response variables could be due to differences in geography, rather than depth or fishing.
The majority of this paper is making comparisons between lionfish populations on shallow coral reefs
and those on adjacent MCEs, with a focus on reefs surrounding Utila, Honduras. Therefore, all results
with the exception of the alert distance comparisons are not confounded by differences in geography,
and so the majority of the manuscript is robust to this criticism.
We acknowledge that it is feasible, though believe it very unlikely, that differences in lionfish responses
(alert distance) to divers between heavily culled shallow Utilan reefs and un-culled Telan reefs were
primarily driven by geographic differences between lionfish populations rather than prolonged exposure
to/absence of culling. Unfortunately, it was not possible to have a balanced experimental design because
of fieldwork logistics. We present the following reef types in this study:
1. Shallow culled (Utila shallow reefs)
2. Mesophotic un-culled (Utila mesophotic reefs)
3. Shallow un-culled (Tela shallow reefs)
Unfortunately preliminary surveys indicated that there are not extensive mesophotic reefs in Tela Bay,
and it was not logistically possible to survey the reefs deeper than 20 m in Tela.
In response to this criticism we have cautioned our results more within the discussion section, to
acknowledge that our behavioral results do not conclusively support ontogenetic migrations, and further
research is required.
1.3 As the paper stands now, it seems like the foundation of the manuscript relies on the distinction
between a ‘culled reef’ and ‘non-culled reef’, yet, there was little discussion how these categories were
determined.
We have expanded the methods section site introduction to be clearer that all Utila’s shallow reefs are
considered ‘culled’, and all Utila’s mesophotic reefs were considered ‘un-culled’. This is justified based on
the low number of technical dives conducted on Utila each year, almost entirely restricting diving, and so
lionfish culling activity, to the shallow reefs. (L 182-185)
1.4 The effects of culling on lionfish density, behavior, and condition are not well-supported, as the
methods and analyses are very vague. Although there was mention of surveys and collections conducted
in Tela Bay, no data were presented.
The majority of data presented in this manuscript is from Utila, however the comparison of alert
distances includes data from Tela Bay. This enables a comparison of lionfish behaviour in shallow culled
reefs (Utila shallow), shallow un-culled (Tela shallow) and mesophotic un-culled (Utila MCE). We have
updated the methods to be clearer on what survey data was collected from different sites (L 173-207),
and the results and discussion section to be clearer on locations that data is being presented from.
1.5 Presentation of the results section is a bit lacking. There’s much emphasis placed on the culled vs
non-culled comparison, yet there is little no discussion in the results about this analysis. Data source
(survey data or collections data) needs to be more clear in all figures and conclusions. See Results
section for more specific comments.
We have clarified the methods section to be more explicit that the culled versus un-culled comparison
for density and dissection data is between shallow (<25 m), intermediate (25-40 m) and mesophotic
(>40 m) depths, with declining culling density with increased depth (L173-207). We have also made
some minor edits to the results section to make it clearer that culling intensity changes across the depth
gradient (L349).
1.6 The strength of the paper lies in the support for ontogenetic shifts and depth refuge from
management efforts. I think the claim that MCE act as a refuge from culling is unsupported with this
dataset, as it is presented in its current form. I’d recommend revising the introduction, discussion, and
conclusion to be more candid about the limitations of the data, as there are many.
We have revised the manuscript, with much greater focus in the discussion section of limitations of the
study following the specific points raised by Reviewer 2 on this issue.
We disagree that the claim that MCEs act as a refuge from culling is unsupported, as Figure 2A
illustrates the high densities of lionfish on MCEs below the depth range of culling. Reviewer 2 supports
our view on this, writing: 'Differences in size (and therefore maturity) and density between depths
around Utila are consistent with an effect of fishing out adults at shallow depths, and the number of
captured fish from shallow versus deep areas supports culling as a driver of this pattern. In my opinion,
this is the strongest aspect of the analysis.’
However, we have revised the manuscript to be much more cautious about attributing patterns in
lionfish population variables to either ontogenetic migrations or culling effects, and encourage further
research in our discussion section to disentangle these two possible drivers (L737-761).
1.7 The reviewer recommends that the paper be restructured to clarify the study design and hypotheses
to ensure a balanced experimental design.
We have made revisions to the introduction and methods to clarify the study design and to be clearer
that the majority of the data presented is from Utila, and we thank the reviewer for these comments as
the manuscript has been strengthened as a result (L173-207). Unfortunately, as previously mentioned,
ensuring a balanced experimental design of treatment types is not possible, as we have no survey data
from the MCEs of Tela Bay due to the logistical and safety considerations of diving at the site.
The majority of the paper focuses on the first detailed study of changes in the lionfish population
variables across shallow reefs to MCEs in Utila. The study is balanced with respect to comparisons across
the Utilan reef depth gradient. The Utila vs Tela Bay comparison is only for alert distance, and therefore,
regardless of this valid point raised by the reviewer of the alert distance data, the paper still makes a
valuable contribution to the lionfish ecology and MCE research fields without incorporation of data from
MCEs from Tela Bay.
Methods
1.8 [line 181] Change the section title to something more descriptive of the metric being analyzed for
consistency with other section titles. For example, “Lionfish Condition and Diet”, or “Condition and
Feeding” for consistency with Discussion section.
Changed to ‘Lionfish condition and diet’ (L227)
1.9 [line 185] ESM 2 refers to a Table, but no table number is included or supplemental file name. It
may be topical to include histograms of the distribution of lionfish size and across depth categories, as
well as sample size.
The table referred to has now been numbered ‘ESM2 Table 1’, and is contained within the ESM2 file.
Figures 2B-C have now been updated to include histograms of lionfish size and weight across the depth
categories as well as sample size.
Results & Analyses
1.10 Authors should refer to the “Statement of good statistical practice” available online to expand on
the statistical methods section. For example, a sentence stating whether the assumptions of an ANOVA
were met should be included.
Now included (L301)
1.11 All figures should have the units in parentheses, not after a ‘/’.
Updated to include units in parentheses throughout all figures.
1.12 Figure 1 might be improved if there was a visual cue to distinguish culled and non-culled sites.
Perhaps, another panel could be added showing the locations of speared lionfish used for Condition and
Diet analyses would be useful? Especially since there were no lionfish found <40m at locations in Figure
1. Finally, I’d be more clear in the caption in regards to the data source for each panel.
All sites on Utila regularly receive culling in the shallows, while the MCEs remain un-culled. Shallow reefs
in Tela are un-culled. We have updated the Figure 1 legend to clarify this.
1.13 Figure 4D. NMDS plot should show all data points, not one cumulative or mean value for each
depth band.
We have updated Figure 4D based on Reviewer 2’s comments to split the lionfish data by size groupings
as well as depth. While it is possible to show stomach content for each individual lionfish in an NMDS
plot such as Figure 4D, the large number of points that will be present, 495 (representing each
individual lionfish), would make interpreting any patterns very difficult. As such we’ve taken the
suggestion of Review 2 which splits the data into a greater number of groups, to allow more
interpretation, without overloading the Figure making patterns hard to distinguish.
1.14 As mentioned above, I’d like to see a distribution of data for lionfish collected via spearfishermen,
both in terms of distribution of data density themselves and lionfish density per depth. I’m interested to
see if the data are normally distributed within each depth category and how variable the groups are
(homoscedastic?) and in terms of group size. It seems unlikely from the collection methods that a
simple ANOVA would suffice, rather than utilizing a resampling approach to handle non-normally
distributed data.
We have updated Figure 2 to show histograms of length and weight distributions of lionfish within each
depth band allowing the distribution of lionfish data from speared fish to be visible. These histograms
also include the number of lionfish sampled at each depth underlying the length/weight distributions. To
compare differences between length and weight of lionfish in each depth zone we have now updated the
analysis to use a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, with a correction for multiple comparisons which are shown
in ESM 8.
Discussion
1.15 [line 340] Need to clarify that this conclusion is only based on collection data, not on the actual
density surveys.
This finding is based on Figure 2A, the lionfish density survey results. In Figure 2A we present the
results of the number of lionfish per transect from surveys at different depths at different sites. We
recorded no lionfish on any of our transects conducted at 5, 15 or 25 m, yet many lionfish on transects
at 40, 55, 70 and 85 m. Hence this conclusion that MCEs (reefs >40 m depth) contain higher densities
of lionfish than shallow reefs (<40 m).
1.16 [line 345] It’s hard to make any claims about MCEs being a refuge from culling since there was no
clarification as to where culling locations were. This is only possibility, but by no means is this dataset
suggestive of a refuge. This could purely be an ontogenetic shift, part of the fish’s biology.
Culling exposure on Utila is based on depth, with shallow reefs exposed to high levels of culling, and
MCEs un-culled. We have clarified the site introduction to make this clearer (L173-207) and also the
caption of Figure 1. We have made major changes to and expanded the discussion section ‘Greater
lionfish density on MCEs than shallow reefs’ to expand our justification for concluding that the low
densities of lionfish observed on shallow reefs are likely driven by the presence of culling removing
individual lionfish (L561-608).
1.17 [line 357] This statement might be better supported if the collections data were presented. It
seems unlikely that this is true, unless the 2016 collections data also showed low to no lionfish present
in shallows.
As discussed earlier, the statement that lionfish densities were greater on MCEs than shallow reefs is
based on the lionfish transects that surveyed the number of lionfish at different depths (Figure 2A).
Using these transects allows the comparison of lionfish numbers across the depth gradient, as all
transects were conducted in a standardised way. While the collections data by spearfishers includes
many shallow lionfish, the number of hours and collection effort in removing lionfish within each depth
zone was not consistent across the range of datasets brought together in this manuscript (ESM2).
Therefore, the high number of lionfish speared and dissected from the shallow reef reflects the large
number of divers searching shallow reefs to cull lionfish, while the deeper reef lionfish collections have
fewer speared lionfish because of our limited resources to conduct research surveys specifically targeting
below the normal culling limit. Therefore differences in number of speared lionfish between depths
should not be considered an indication of differing lionfish densities at the different depth zones. The
lionfish density transects (Figure 2A) were specifically conducted to allow quantification of differences in
density across the depth with a consistent methodology. We have now included several sentences to
explicitly clarify this in our methods section to avoid any confusion (L235-245)
Supplemental
1.18 ESM 2: See notes above in Methods section. Expand document to include a figure or table showing
distribution of data across depth.
We have now updated Figure 2B and 2C to include this length and weight distribution and number of
sampled lionfish within each depth zone.
1.19 ESM 3: Add title or description. Unclear what data represent.
See file marked ‘ESM Captions’ that was included alongside the ESM files. ESM Captions contains a
detailed legend for ESM 3 with explanation of what each column in the csv data file contains.
1.20 ESM 8: ANCOVA results are presented with transformed data. However, no mention of an ANCOVA
analysis was presented in the Methods section. Furthermore, the only transformation of data described
is for the NMDS analysis.
Now updated in the methods section to include ANCOVA analysis and data transformation (L296-301).
Reviewer: 2
Overview
2.1 The authors survey lionfish size, maturity, and density on shallow and mesophotic reefs around Utila
(where culling takes place regularly) and on shallow reefs in Tela Bay. They also measure ‘reaction
distance’ for lionfish encountered in each region (at shallow depths in Tela Bay, and across depths in
Utila). The authors find that lionfish are larger, more mature, and more abundant on mesophotic reefs
compared with shallow sites in Utila. Stomach analysis of lionfish revealed they were primarily
consuming fish prey. They also find that the reaction distance of lionfish was significantly different
between the two regions they studied (Utila and Tela Bay), and did not vary with depth in Utila.
Major comments
2.2 This study addresses a topic of interest for invasive lionfish management. In general I found the
manuscript to be well written and clearly organized. The authors’ work provides some interesting
insights about the effects of culling on the depth distribution of invasive lionfish around Utila.
Thank you.
2.3 Differences in size (and therefore maturity) and density between depths around Utila are consistent
with an effect of fishing out adults at shallow depths, and the number of captured fish from shallow
versus deep areas supports culling as a driver of this pattern. In my opinion, this is the strongest aspect
of the analysis.
Thank you, in our revision to the manuscript based on your comments below we have expanded the
focus on studying the effects of culling and fishing out lionfish in the shallows.
2.4 However, there are several places where the authors have overextend the inferences they can make
about lionfish ontogenetic habitat use and movement given their study design. While insights from diet
and behavior could be useful indirect lines of evidence, key elements of these data sets are missing that
are needed to evaluate patterns of recruitment and movement between habitats. In particular, because
the ‘non-culling’ area (Tela Bay) does not share the same depth stratification as the ‘culled’ areas
(Utila), it is not possible to know whether differences in lionfish reaction distance between the two
regions are truly due to ‘escape’ from culling and move deep, or some other site-specific differences. A
robust test would examine multiple culled and un-culled sites, all consisting of shallow and deep
habitats, to evaluate the behaviour of lionfish in deep habitats that are adjacent in un-culled sites.
Without this information, the authors’ conclusions are tenuous at best and need to have appropriate
caveats added about the design and other possible mechanisms at play (see detailed comments).
We agree that ideally for the most robust test of ontogenetic movements a study would examine
multiple culled and un-culled sites at both shallow and mesophotic depths. However, unfortunately this
has not been possible for us and logistically was beyond the scope of what was achievable in this study.
We have responded to your specific points below, and in general added caveats about the other possible
mechanisms and design limitations throughout the discussion (e.g. L613-616, 674-679).
2.5 In addition, diet composition data on its own does not inform our understanding of where lionfish
have been feeding at such a fine spatial scale. To get at habitat use, the authors would need information
on the availability of prey to lionfish by each depth band, in order to evaluate what we as being
consumed versus available. Assuming that differences in species composition by depth is greater than
variation across sites (which is not clear from this MS), they may be able to ascertain whether deep
lionfish were consuming shallow prey more frequently than expected, or vice versa. This result would
provide some indirect evidence for recent movement between habitats (at least, over the time scale
needed to digest prey). However, an absence of diet items from other habitat types does not prove that
the individual has not been moving between habitats, because this pattern may have been missed
depending on the relative timing of feeding, digestion, and movement. Lionfish also are known to
consume prey selectively, which may affect patterns of resource use (see Green and Côté 2014). At a
minimum, these considerations and caveats needs to be addressed in the discussion.
Specific comments on the diet data addressed below. In the manuscript we do not suggest that changes
in prey presence in lionfish stomachs could or should be interpreted to indicate movement patterns in
lionfish between depths. We agree with the reviewer that to do this would require more detailed data on
prey availability at different depths and between sites that is available in published literature that we
cite.
Instead, rather than directly trying to infer whether lionfish are moving across depth gradients based on
their diet, we simply present the diet data of lionfish within our different depth categories to identify
whether there are any differences in diet within each depth category. We are not aware of any other
published studies that contain lionfish diet comparisons across shallow reefs to MCEs, and so we hope to
use our results to increase understanding of whether diet patterns do change across depth.
We have now acknowledged that lionfish may consume prey selectively and cite the recommended
Green and Côté (2014) paper (L770).
Specific comments
2.6 Line 1: The title is not an accurate reflections of the scope of key findings in this MS (there is not
enough evidence to disentangle whether ontogenetic migration or movement is occurring). Please revise
to “Depth-dependent effects of culling on invasive lionfish population density, size, and behavior” or
similar.
The title has been revised to 'Depth-dependent effects of culling - do mesophotic lionfish populations
undermine current management?'
2.7 Line 42-44: How did lionfish size and maturity compare between shallow sites in Utila and Tela Bay?
We agree that this would be an interesting comparison, unfortunately we do not have shallow lionfish
size and maturity data from Tela available for this study, so we are unable to make this comparison.
2.8 Line 48-49: See my comments and the stomach contents analysis. This statement is misleading, as
you may expect that fishes would dominate the diet at all depths depending on what is available.
We have now edited this statement to be clearer (L50)
2.9 Lines 49-53: I don’t see how your results at all provide evidence for ontogenetic migration. What I
take way from this is that culling affects the size and density of lionfish on shallow sites. Without
information on the behaviour of lionfish from deep habitats adjacent to un-culled shallow zones, this link
is very tenuous and I would remove it from the abstract.
Removed reference to our results supporting an ontogenetic migration in lionfish from the abstract.
2.10 Lines 90-91: But you cite multiple studies with conflicting patterns of size depending on location
throughout the paragraph. I would remove this sentence, and start this section with ‘The extent to which
lionfish in the invaded Caribbean exhibit habitat specific recruitment and ontogenetic migration between
habitats is unclear.”
Done, section now starts: 'The extent to which lionfish in the invaded western Atlantic exhibit specific
recruitment and ontogenetic migration between habitats is unclear.’ (L103)
2.11 Line 112: These two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, because lionfish culling on shallow
sites will likely reduce the average size (and therefore fecundity) of individuals compared to MCE fish.
Make this explicit and revise to “and/or”.
Done (L136-138)
2.12 Lines 144-162: This section needs to make it clear that not all of the same data were collected on
Utila and Tela Bay (only behaviour, not density/size surveys and stomach contents- these were collected
for Utila only, correct?)
Correct, only behaviour data (alert distance) was collected in Tela Bay, all other data is from Utila. We
have revised the methods section to make this clearer (L173-207).
2.13 Line 166: Make it clear that the surveys were conducted on Utila (not Tela Bay).
We have clarified this in the methods section (L173-207)
2.14 Lines 166-179: Green et al. 2013 (Coral Reefs) show that transect surveys greatly underestimate
lionfish density, and the bias depends on habitat and fish size. I would imagine that video surveys suffer
from this same limitation. Given that readers will be relaying your density information in successive
literature on the invasion, I think this bias is important to consider and incorporate into your measures
of density (Figure 2) and in the Discussion.
We have expanded the section on lionfish density with depth in the Discussion. We now cite the Green et
al 2013 paper, and acknowledge the limitations of transects for surveying lionfish density. We also cite a
recently published paper by Henly (2017) that surveyed the shallow reefs of Utila in 2015 at the same
time our study was conducted using targeted lionfish searches (the recommended method by Green et
al 2013). In this paper, despite extensively visually searching crevices in the reef, Henly recorded
lionfish densities at 5 and 10 m depth on Utila at approximately 0.16 individuals per 250 m2, and no
individuals at 15 m depth. While we did not record any lionfish at 5, 15, or 25 m depth, the 5 and 10 m
density Henly reports is far below the densities we present from MCEs on Utila (up to 3.0 individuals per
250 m2). Therefore, our transect densities appear to correlate well with extensive lionfish visual
surveys, and we have confidence that our transects are appropriate for giving changes in lionfish density
across the depth gradient. (L569-608).
2.15 Line 187: How many lionfish were collected from each depth? Given the total number of samples,
and samples by depth band here.
Now added (L233-235)
2.16 Lines 205-219: The authors need to provide more information on the state of other variables
known to affect lionfish behavior, including the time of day that observations were conducted (light
levels and in situ behavior affect fish reactions; i.e. whether they are resting or active), the structural
complexity of habitats between locations, which would affect the ease with which lionfish are able to
escape approaches- was this the same between the two regions?
We have added information on the time of day, as all sampling was done during daylight hours. (L272).
Unfortunately we do not have data available for this paper on whether lionfish were resting or active
prior to being approached, and alert distance was recorded for all individual lionfish observed regardless
of their activity state prior to diver approach. We have expanded the discussion section where we talk
about these alert distance results, and cited a paper which assesses shallow reef structural complexity in
both Utila and Tela, and that measures benthic habitat changes across the shallow to mesophotic depth
gradient. (L569-608, L726-736)
2.17 Lines 226-239: As is, this analysis really doesn’t tell us much about the spatial distribution of diet
composition with only three points. Are you able to divide fish by the site they were captured at, in
addition to depth band? Given that size has a large effect on diet composition, the analysis would
provide more ecological insights if you divided the stomach samples by the size of lionfish (perhaps by
5cm size bins), and then constructing your ordination using a combination of point colour and shape to
represent depth/size.
This analysis is uses only lionfish that stomachs contained fish identifiable to family level, so the analysis
is based on 495 individual fish. Because of the reduced sample size it is not possible to break these fish
into depth bands, lengths groupings and sites without reducing some of these categories to very few
individual fish. We have split the diet data based on lionfish length depth bins (<150 mm, 150-250 mm,
250-350 mm and >350 mm), allowing us to compare how lionfish body size and depth affects the diet.
Figure 4 has been updated to show this. The results and discussion have also been updated.
2.18 Lines 242-251: I would image that the activity the lionfish is engaged in while the diver is
approaching may also influence reaction distance. If it’s available, I think it would be very important to
include information on lionfish behaviour at the time the reaction distance measurement was into the
model.
We agree that the behaviour of the lionfish may influence the alert distance, unfortunately these data
are not available for this study.
2.19 Lines 275-287: The way that gonad stage is treated statistically is not correct; stage is not a
continuous variable (i.e. you cannot have stage 2.5). For females, I would suggest presenting these data
simply as proportions that were mature for each size class and by depth. I would remove reference to
male gonad ‘stage’ all together, as this is very difficult to assess visually, whereas weight is easy to
measure accurately, for this sex.
Changed to show female lionfish gonad stages as proportions, and male gonad stage has now been
removed. Figure 3 has been updated, and the methods, results and discussion updated to reflect this
change.
2.20 Lines 275-279: You would expect that larger fish and have larger gonads, so this result is not
surprising. What would be really interesting is to see whether there are any differences in the ratio of
gonad:body weight. This would reveal whether lionfish were more mature, for a given size, at depth.
Changed to show gonad:body weight ratio for both females (Figure 3C) and males (Figure 3D) to allow
comparisons of gonad weight for given size. Results and discussion have been updated accordingly.
2.21 Lines 303-304: This is an interesting result!
Thank you.
2.22 Lines 305-206: Give the proportion of stomachs that contained identifiable prey, and the sample
size of lionfish that were dissected.
Added (L469-472)
2.23 Lines 318-320: Remove “implying that there is more similarity between fish families...”. This is an
interpretative statement that should be saved for the Conclusion, and warrants more discussion than
given here.
Removed
2.24 Lines 327-336: How many lionfish did you observe in each depth per location? This is key
information needed to evaluate how robust your results are.
Now added (L506)
2.25 Line 323: I’m not following your statement “...suggesting at the two sites lionfish alert distance did
not change with depth”. Which two sites are you referring to? As I understand it, you did not measure
lionfish behavior on deep habitats in Tela Bay (only shallow sites), and so cannot speak to changes in
behaviour with depth there.
We were previously considering depth as a continuous variable for the lionfish alert distance, as we have
exact depths for each individual lionfish observation. We have now rerun the analysis using the depth
groupings used elsewhere in the paper, with shallow Tela (0-20 m), shallow Utila (0-25 m) and MCE
Utila (40-72 m). Table 2 has been updated with these new results, and the rest of the manuscript has
been updated appropriately (e.g. L501-510).
2.26 Lines 343-344: See my comment about evaluating gonad:body size. It’s not surprising that you
found more mature/larger gonads given that fish were larger.
Updated based on new analysis of gonad:body weight ratio (L518)
2.27 Lines 350-353: I disagree that your results support ontogenetic migrations as the primary
mechanism. They support an effect of culling on size and density, but with no scientific control (i.e.
behavior of MCE lionfish adjacent to unculled reefs) and replication, the line of evidence is incomplete.
It’s important to acknowledge these caveats, as well as discuss other mechanisms that may be influence
behaviour between the locations and depths (habitat complexity, fish size, conspecific density, fish
behaviour at the time of the measurement, light levels).
Updated in the first discussion paragraph to place less emphasis on ontogenetic migrations in lionfish
and discuss depth-dependent effects of culling (L514-528). Updated the discussion section that
previously focused on ontogenetic migrations to consider these additional issues and not be so focused
on ontogenetic migrations (e.g. L613-616, L674-679).
2.28 Lines 356-370: Add discussion on bias in estimating method.
Added paragraph on this (L569-608).
2.29 Line 375-391, and 400-413: These sections greatly overstep the conclusions that can be supported
with the information in this study. The observed patterns of size and maturity are explained just as well
by the effect of culling on lionfish size (and therefore life stage/gonad weight). These two explanations
needs to be given equal weight here, as the effect of culling is not disentangled from ontogeny in this
study.
Major edits have been made to this section to give more weight to culling as a driver of the pattern
rather than possible ontogenetic migrations. (L613-616, L674-679)
2.30 Lines 423-430: Need to also acknowledge the limitations of your design, and other mechanisms
that could be responsible (see my comment above).
Limitations of alert distance assessments now included (L726-736).
2.31 Lines 453-480: Diet may reflect what is available by depth to some degree, but is also a reflection
of selectivity (i.e. Green and Côté 2014) which affects your ability to detect patterns of resource use
from diet data alone.
We have now added a sentence to the discussion to acknowledge that lionfish show selectivity in diets
(L769-770).
2.32 Lines 471-475: See comments about about including lionfish size in the MDS analysis.
Now done, patterns in fish community composition of the diet appear primarily depth driven rather than
body size driven (Figure 4D).
2.33 Lines 482-522- This a well written and thoughtful discussion on options for MCE lionfish
management.
Thank you
2.34 Lines 528-529- See comments above about maturity/gonad weight relative to body size above.
Either add “due to their increased size”, or provide information on whether gonad weight is greater for
MCE when controlling for lionfish weigh (i.e. proportion of body mass).
Updated (L851)
2.35 Figure 1. The black dot in the inset of Figure 1A indicating the study region should be an un-filled
rectangle around the study region to be consistent. I would recommend zooming in on the region map
so that you can see the region a little more clearly. Reduce Tela and Utila label size; add rectangular
outlines around each of these sub regions where you did the surveys.
Updated (Figure 1)
2.36 Figure 2: Y-axis label on A: “Density (lionfish 250m-2)”, change /m, /cm, /Kg to (m), (cm), (Kg) on
axes in both panels. Give number of samples (in A = sites (?) and in B/C = # individual lionfish) either
in the figure caption or in the figure above each bar.
Updated (Figure 2), number of sites for Figure 2A now given in caption, and number of lionfish for
Figures 2B-C now given on Figure 2B.
2.37 Figure 3: See comments about analysing gonad stage; cannot have a half stage. Give information
on the proportion of lionfish in each stage per depth band. Need x axis labels on A, B, C panels. I would
remove panel B and keep this figure about gonad weight for males, given that it is very difficult to
assess male maturity visually. Change /g to (g). Given number of specimens (sample size) for each
depth by panel in the Figure caption or above bars in the plots.
Updated to show proportion of lionfish (Figure 3A), original panel B removed, units included in
parenthesis. Sample sizes by depth have been added to the figure caption.
2.38 Figure 4: Spell out ‘Proportion’, or change to %. Change /m to (m) in X axes. Give sample sizes for
all panels. D. Add in lionfish size into the MDS to make this panel more informative; as is, I’m not
convinced that it adds much to the manuscript.
Done (Figure 4)
2.39 Table 1: I had a hard time interpreting this table, and I’m sure your other readers will too. In which
columns/rows does the proportion add up to 1? What are your sample sizes of stomach for each depth
band? Is this proportion by individual stomach, or pooled together for all lionfish in a depth band?
The columns add up to 1, indicating the proportion of diet within the depth band comprised of different
fish families. This table is based on all fish identified to family level across all lionfish stomachs, we have
added a note to clarify this to the table caption along with the number of lionfish stomachs containing
fish identifiable to family level per depth band.
Table 2: I have several questions about these results:
2.40 - How many lionfish did you observe in each region/depth zone? Given that very few lionfish (and
in some cases, none) were sighted on shallow Utila sites in your video surveys, do you have a balanced
design with this aspect of the paper?
We have now included the number of lionfish alert distance observations in the table caption. We had
much greater numbers of lionfish we measured alert distance for from Tela than Utila. However, the
effect size when comparing lionfish alert distance between Tela and Utila is very large, so despite our
smaller Utila sample size our analysis still has sufficient statistical power to detect highly significant
differences between the regions.
2.41 - How could you test for an interaction between region and depth, when one of the two regions did
not have an MCE area?
We have removed this now. We previously were treating depth as a continuous variable in this analysis,
as we had the exact depth of each alert distance measure from Utila and Tela. However, the depth range
of observations from Tela was only 0-20 m while on Utila spanned 0-72 m. We have now rerun the
analysis of Table 2 treating depth as a categorical variable, comparing shallow Tela (0-20 m) with
shallow Utila (0-25 m) and mesophotic Utila (40-72 m).
2.42 - The significant effect of lionfish length is important for this manuscript (though the effect size is
small as it is for all effects), since you observed differences in lionfish size per depth band and warrants
more discussion in the manuscript.
We have now briefly mentioned the effect of lionfish body size on alert distance in the discussion in
relation to other studies of flight initiation distance in reef fish (L726-728).
2.43 - What are the units on the alert distance measurement here?
Alert distance is measured in cm, which we have now added to the methods. In Table 2 the coefficient
estimates are natural log transformed.
