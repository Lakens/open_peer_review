This is an interesting paper based upon a survey of researchers views on what criteria should be
used to define eye saccades and fixation. The data is thoroughly analysed and discussed and I
have no major issues.
I wonder whether a key take home message should be that people working with eye movements
and fixations in whatever research area (from neurophysiology to market research) really need to
understand what they are dealing with and not just take for granted that what parsing algorithms
throw out equates precisely to saccades and fixations. In the old days we would always parse
saccades and fixations in a semi-automated way, trial by trial, movement by movement, which
was very time consuming but made you see how sometimes saccade / fixation / blink criteria
made mistakes and also that eye movements themselves sometimes don't obey are ideas that
there is a clear boundary between fixations and saccades.
Also I wonder at the end of the day whether this really all matters in the grand scheme of things?
Isn't it just adding a bit of noise / slight variation between studies where the criteria for fixation
for example differs, rather than introducing any systematic bias in experimental results when
comparisons are made between experimental conditions and manipulations? Can you give more
examples of where confusion can lead to really serious errors or false conflicts between research
findings? Otherwise there is a danger this can just look like a topic of interest to eye movement
nerds like myself!

The authors present a well-conducted study which characterizes semantic disagreement over the
definition of saccades and fixations by members of the eye tracking community. The
disagreement is demonstrated by survey, and statistical analysis. I’m relieved that this
manuscript has been submitted – once it is published, my rants at conferences will finally be
supported by quantitative data! This was also a fairly easy review; I have carefully read this
manuscript twice, and have little constructive or critical feedback to offer (a rarity). The
manuscript is well motivated, clearly written, and the analyses straight-forward. I imagine it will
receive a fair number of citations (I, for one, will be sure to cite it often). My few comments are
listed below.
- Few develop algorithms or analyze data in the absence of a video record, and I believe some of
the issues revealed by the paper are purely semantic, and would be resolved if a scene video (or
another form of video record) were presented in conjunction with the velocity/position signals.
The authors should discuss, and perhaps advocate for the role of the video in the process of
algorithm development.
- The authors could adopt a more explanatory term for “the stillness definition” for many of the
reasons that motivated them to write this article. I believe they mean rotational stillness of the
eye, and not stillness of the point of regard in a world frame. If that’s the case, perhaps a better
term would be, eye-stillness, rotational-stillness, stable eye-in-head, or something similar.
- The authors may consider promoting terminology, such as “eye-in-head,” or “gaze-in- world”
signal, which resolve ambiguities related to frames of reference. I struggle to find the first
manuscript to adopt this terminology, and wonder if it was first adopted by the Hayhoe lab.
Mary may be a good resource on the matter.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting paper based upon a survey of researchers views on what
criteria should be used to define eye saccades and fixation. The data is thoroughly
analysed and discussed and I have no major issues.
I wonder whether a key take home message should be that people working with eye
movements and fixations in whatever research area (from neurophysiology to
market research) really need to understand what they are dealing with and not just
take for granted that what parsing algorithms throw out equates precisely to
saccades and fixations. In the old days we would always parse saccades and
fixations in a semi-automated way, trial by trial, movement by movement, which
was very time consuming but made you see how sometimes saccade / fixation /
blink criteria made mistakes and also that eye movements themselves sometimes
don't obey are ideas that there is a clear boundary between fixations and saccades.
Response: We agree with the reviewer that this should be a key message, and have
added it to the discussion prior to the final conclusion.
Also I wonder at the end of the day whether this really all matters in the grand
scheme of things? Isn't it just adding a bit of noise / slight variation between studies
where the criteria for fixation for example differs, rather than introducing any
systematic bias in experimental results when comparisons are made between
experimental conditions and manipulations? Can you give more examples of where
confusion can lead to really serious errors or false conflicts between research
findings? Otherwise there is a danger this can just look like a topic of interest to eye
movement nerds like myself!
Response: We have worked out examples in the Introduction of where the sources
of confusion can lead to false conflicts or non-sensical comparisons:
On frames of reference:
“However, in some software packages from eye-tracker manufacturers it is possible
to apply the exact same algorithm for classifying fixations and saccades to data from
remote and mobile eye trackers, which can lead to eye-movement metrics that
seems comparable (as they involve the same terminology), but are actually
incomparable (as the underlying signals are fundamentally different).”
“That different frames of reference can lead to implicit conceptual confusion is
evident from the literature. In some cases the term `fixation' is used both in world-
centered and head-centered frames of reference, even in the same research field,
without explicitly distinguishing between the two. In infant looking behavior, for
example, \citet{Merin:2007kl} report on fixations recorded with a remote eye
tracker, whereas \citet{Franchak:2011di} report on fixations recorded with a mobile
eye tracker. This is problematic for two reasons. First, when properties of fixations
from both studies are discussed without considering the coordinate system, a
nonsensical comparison is made. For example, when comparing fixation durations
between infants of different ages and different methods, confusion may arise.
Infants aged a few months are less capable of disengaging attention and shifting
gaze to a new fixation location than older infants, such that their `fixations' are
generally of longer duration. `Fixations' may, however, also be of shorter or longer
duration if the same algorithm is applied to eye-tracking data from a remote or
mobile eye tracker. Second, the oculomotor system is heavily under development
just after birth, such that infants develop the ability to pursue moving objects with
respect to the environment within the first year \citep{Johnson:1990jr}. Particularly
here it is vital to be specific on what constitutes a `fixation', and whether the
`fixation'-target is moving with respect to the infant or not, in order to avoid
potential confusion due to concepts being underspecified.”
On event detection:
“This distinction is important. For example, if one were to take `saccades' as
`detected' by an algorithm to be true saccades, one might draw wrong conclusions,
e.g. that saccades in the dark are slower than saccades in the light. If, on the other
hand, one considers the feature which is measured from the eye by the eye tracker,
in this case the pupil, it turns out that the apparent slowing of saccades in the dark
is an artifact of the eye-tracking technique based on said feature
\citep{Felssberg:2018dz}”
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors present a well-conducted study which characterizes semantic
disagreement over the definition of saccades and fixations by members of the eye
tracking community. The disagreement is demonstrated by survey, and statistical
analysis. I’m relieved that this manuscript has been submitted – once it is published,
my rants at conferences will finally be supported by quantitative data! This was also
a fairly easy review; I have carefully read this manuscript twice, and have little
constructive or critical feedback to offer (a rarity). The manuscript is well motivated,
clearly written, and the analyses straight-forward. I imagine it will receive a fair
number of citations (I, for one, will be sure to cite it often). My few comments are
listed below.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the appreciation of our work.
- Few develop algorithms or analyze data in the absence of a video record, and I
believe some of the issues revealed by the paper are purely semantic, and would be
resolved if a scene video (or another form of video record) were presented in
conjunction with the velocity/position signals. The authors should discuss, and
perhaps advocate for the role of the video in the process of algorithm development.
Response: We have added a discussion of how video records (or other sources of
information such as accelerometers) can resolve some of the ambiguity in velocity
profiles of head-mounted eye-trackers, in the Introduction:
“Granted, the ambiguity in a velocity profile of a head-centered gaze measurement
with regard to whether the eye or the head moves can be resolved by adding other
sources of information. For example, one might use an accelerometer or video
record to determine whether the head or eyes move with respect to the
environment. Such information sources are generally not featured, however, in
algorithms that allow automatic eye-tracking data analysis \citep[but
see][]{Larsson:2016ck,Larsson:2016ft}.”
- The authors could adopt a more explanatory term for “the stillness definition”
for many of the reasons that motivated them to write this article. I believe they
mean rotational stillness of the eye, and not stillness of the point of regard in a
world frame. If that’s the case, perhaps a better term would be, eye-stillness,
rotational-stillness, stable eye-in-head, or something similar.
Response: We agree with the reviewer, and have changed all mentions of a
‘stillness’ definition to an ‘eye-stillness’ definition, except when ‘stillness’ was
already followed by reference to the eye.
- The authors may consider promoting terminology, such as “eye-in-head,” or
“gaze-in- world” signal, which resolve ambiguities related to frames of reference. I
struggle to find the first manuscript to adopt this terminology, and wonder if it was
first adopted by the Hayhoe lab. Mary may be a good resource on the matter.
Response: We have added this terminology in the introduction when frames of
reference are first discussed. Such terminology occurs at least back in the work of
Collewijn (1977).
“Such frames of reference may also be termed eye-in-head or gaze-in-world/eye-in-
space \citep[e.g.][]{Collewijn:1977wu,Hayhoe:2003wm}”
- Line 457: represent to represents
- Line 724: change velocities to classification functions.
Response: We have adopted these suggestions in the manuscript.
