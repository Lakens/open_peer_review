Response to reviewer1:
1. It is well known that biomass consists of impurities. The elemental analysis of raw
materials and as-prepared materials.
We are very sorry for our unclear report in the basic characterization of raw
material and as-prepared materials. For the electrode material of supercapacitor, the
influence of its elemental composition on its EDLC behavior is enormous. The
elemental analysis is needed. As shown in Fig.1a, the crude polysaccharide has a
natural three-dimensional
Fig. 1 (a),(b): The photograph of the raw material (polysaccharide). (c): FT-IR
analysis of the polysaccharide and CPC600. (d) The edx analysis of
polysaccharide and CPC600. (e), (f), (g), (h): The mapping analysis of the

self-supporting mechanism. Before carbonization, in addition to the common elements
in organic substances such as C, O, the polysaccharide also contains some K
elements, and there are no other impurities (such as heavy metals such as Fe) that
affect its electrochemical properties, and these naturally occurring activators It may
also be the reason why the prepared material desired specific surface area and
porosity. After carbonization, as shown in fig.1b, the
2. For the electrochemical result, Coulombic and energy efficiencies are needed.
Fig 2. The specific capacitance and coulombic efficiency of CPC600
As shown in Fig S2(b), after 5000 cycles, the CPC600 has a certain agglomeration
phenomenon, and its flaky structure was not obviously destroyed after thousands of
cycles. Therefore, the specific capacitance of CPC600 still retains 92.1.% after 5000
cycles, as shown in fig s2(a). As for the coulombic efficiency, after 5000 cycles, the
coulomb efficiency is generally stable at 90%, which indicates that CPC has good cycle
stability.
3. Self-discharge testing is also needed.
Fig 3. The self-discharge measurements of supercapacitors
As shown in fig.3, the self-discharge measurements of supercapacitors were
carried out according to the IEC 62391-1 standard. The supercapacitors were
completely discharged prior to the self- discharge study. Then, the supercapacitors
were charged up to a voltage of 2.3 V with a constant current so that 95% of their rated
voltage is attained within 30 minutes. It was held at rated voltage for 8 hours. After the
8 hours holding period, it was then disconnected from the voltage source. The open
circuit voltage of supercapacitor was recorded using the Supercapacitor Testing
System for 16 hours. The Equivalent Parallel Resistance (EPR) of
supercapacitors was calculated from the open circuit voltage of the supercapacitors
using equation (1):
(1)
Where V1 and V2 are the voltages at time t1 and t2 respectively, C is the
capacitance of supercapacitor in Farad. The leakage current of the
supercapacitors was also calculated using (2)
(2)
Where IL is the leakage current, dV/dt is the slope of the curve and C is the
capacitance
in Farad. Fig S2a shows the time dependent decrease in open circuit potential of
graphene supercapacitors. It is obvious from fig S2 that the open circuit voltages of the
supercapacitors are decreasing with respect to time. The instantaneous initial drop is
due to relatively higher Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) of graphene
supercapacitors. After the instantaneous drop due to ESR, we can observe two
distinct portions in the self-discharge curve of which the first one is a fast discharge
portion with a shorter time duration followed by a slow discharge portion. The
mechanism of self-discharge can be understood by analysing the selfdischarge curve
in detail. Fig S2 (c) shows the relation between the log (self-discharge voltage) as a
function of time. Generally, discharge through an ohmic leakage leads to a declining
linear relation between log V and t. From Fig S2(c), it is evident that, even after
neglecting the initial drop due to ESR, the curve does not follow a perfect linear path.
Hence the selfdischarge cannot be only due to the ohmic leakage pathways between
the two electrodes. There can be some additional mechanism which also contributes
to the self-discharge. In order to understand whether there is any diffusion-controlled
mechanism, we have also plotted V vs t1/2. Fig S3(d) shows the relation between self-
discharge voltage decline V and t1/2. In general, due to diffusion controlled faradaic
leakage current in carbon based supercapacitors, the open circuit voltage shows a
linear declining relation with t1/2. As obvious from Fig S3(d), the V and t1/2 have a
better linear relation particularly in the slow discharge region. This clearly indicates that
the diffusion-controlled mechanism will be the predominant mechanism in self
discharge of these supercapacitors in addition to the ohmic leakage[1]. From fig S3(c),
it is clear that V vs logt curves shows no linearity. Thus it can be confirmed that there
is no contribution from overcharging in the self-discharge of graphene supercapacitors.
Hence it is clear that the self-discharge in these graphene supercapacitors is controlled
by the combined contribution from potential controlled model due to ohmic leakage and
diffusion-controlled model due to charge re-distribution phenomenon.
4. Any effects or charge contribution from the surface impurity or functional group?
As for FT-IR for the somke-like carbon, the broad peak at 3500 cm-1 is the
intermolecular and intramolecular -OH group stretching vibration peak of the fungus
polysaccharide, and the double peak at 2900 cm-1 is the CH2 group in the fiber, and
the peak at 1650 cm-1 indicates C=O. The symmetric stretching vibration, the peak at
1100 cm-1 is the stretching vibration of the C-O-C group. The peak at 1000 cm-1
indicates the presence of a pyranose ring in the polysaccharide of the fungus. After
carbonization and pickling, potassium ions almost completely evaporate, so the
existence of potassium is one of the key points of our further study [2].
5. The authors should cite other previous work relating to bio-activated carbon-based
supercapacitors e.g., Electrochimica Acta 2019, 305, 443-451; Electrochimica Acta
2018, 286, 55-64.
We are very glade to quote these two works in this manuscript. Sethuraman
Sathyamoorthia studied a simple and practical hybrid dual ionic liquid (IL)/1.0 M
LiTFSI(aq.) is proposed using ILs in the nanopores of activated carbon for high cell
potential supercapacitor and Nutthaphon Phattharasupakun have found that a fast Na
ion diffusion of 10-8-10-11 cm2 s-1 and a fast-standard heterogeneous rate constant
of electron transfer of ca. 10-5 cm s-1 are two reasons leading to high-performance
NIC. Give us a lot of help for our work on carbon-based supercapacitor testing,
especially in self-discharge testing and cycle stability testing.
Response to reviewer2:
1. BET calculation requires more details. Such as which device was used?
Fig 1. BET analysis (a) and pore size distributions (b) of CPCs
To investigate the porous structure and surface area of CPC, N2
adsorption/desorption was carried out as shown in FIG.S4. The CPC exhibits type I
isotherm with a small H4 hysteresis loop indicating the existence of
microporous/mesoporous with small amount of microporous. Materials. Note, the
CPCs exhibits very high N2 uptake in the low-pressure region (p/p0 < 0.01), suggesting
the very large amounts of microporosity. The calculated BET specific surface area,
total pore volume, and mean pore diameter of CPC are 2377 m2 g-1, 1.50 cm3 g-1,
and 2.53 nm, respectively. For the pore size distribution in the micropore region
(calculated from NLDFT method) as shown in Fig S4, the CPC displays a single pore
size of 1.93 nm, whilst in the mesopore region (calculated from BJH method), the
average pore size is 0.7 nm as shown in the inset image.
2. Miss-spell pg5 line 47 "ant" should be "and", also same page line 26 "respecticely".
We are very sorry for the confusion for editors and reviewers caused by our
negligence in the writing process. We have already checked the manuscript and
corrected the above mistakes.
3. Power density supposed to be calculated by discharge time, not time difference.
Thanks to the reviewer for pointing out, we are sorry for the unclear report in the
manuscript. The <U+25B3>t means the discharge time instead of difference, we have changed
<U+25B3> t (s) to t (s) in our manuscript to make it more clear.
4. Please add "and" between 0.927 - 1.162 cm3/g; pg6 line 27.Please add a,b,c,d to

Fig.2. Electrochemical performance of CPC600 and the compara-tion with the pervious
work.
We are very sorry for the confusion for editors and reviewers caused by our
negligence in the writing process. We have already checked the manuscript and
corrected the above mistakes.
5. I would like to see 1000 charge-discharge cycle performance for single electrode and
symmetric device.
Fig 3. The specific capacitance and coulombic efficiency of CPC600
As shown in Fig 3b, after 5000 cycles, the CPC600 has a certain agglomeration
phenomenon, and its flaky structure was not obviously destroyed after thousands of
cycles. Therefore, the specific capacitance of CPC600 still retains 92.1.% after 5000
cycles, as shown in fig 3(a). As for the coulombic efficiency, after 5000 cycles, the
coulomb efficiency is generally stable at 90%, which indicates that CPCs has good
cycle stability[4].
6. SEM pictures after the 1000 cycles would be beneficial.
As shown in Fig 3, after 5000 cycles, the CPC600 has a certain agglomeration
phenomenon, and its flaky structure was not obviously destroyed after thousands of
cycles. Therefore, the specific capacitance of CPC600 still retains 92.1.% after 5000
cycles, as shown in fig s2(a). As for the coulombic efficiency, after 5000 cycles, the
coulomb efficiency is generally stable at 90%, which indicates that CPC has good cycle
stability.
7. Authors did not mention about the electrode preparation methods. What subtract
material used, what was the mass loading of the electrodes?
We are very sorry for our unclear report on the preparation methods of the
electrodes and the solid-state symmetric supercaoacitors, now add as follows:
1, Fabrication of electrodes and solid-state symmetric supercapacitors
Nickel foam was first cut into rectangle sheets (20 mm * 10 mm) and treated with
acetone, diluted HCl and deionized water each for 10 min ultra-sonication. A mixture
containing 80 wt% active material, 10 wt% conductive carbon black and 10 wt%
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was well grinded with appropriate amount of N-methyl-
2-pyrrolidone (NMP) for 1 h to obtain a black paste. The paste was then casted on half
of the pre-treated nickel foam and dried in a vacuum oven at 120 ºC for 8 h. The
electrode was finally obtained by pressing at 10 MPa for 1 min. The loading mass of
active materials on each working electrode was about 3.0 mg. The solid-state
symmetric supercapacitor was assembled by two identical electrodes, wherein
KOH/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel was used as the electrolyte. For preparing the
KOH/PVA gel, 2.0 g PVA was first mixed with 20 mL deionized water and the mixture
was heated to 85 ºC under vigorous stirring until it became clear. Then, 10 mL KOH
solution (6.0 M) was slowly added into the above mixture. The solution was kept stirring
for 0.5 h at 85 ºC to form a clear gel electrolyte. Two electrodes were immersed in the
as-prepared electrolyte for 5 min before assembly. Then, the electrodes were picked
out and transferred to a fume hood at room temperature for 1 h to vaporize the excess
water. Finally the electrodes were pressed together under the pressure of 1 MPa for
10 min and sealed with plastic wrap to assemble the solid-state supercapacitor. The
total mass of active materials for a symmetric supercapacitor was 6.0 mg[3].
2, Fabrication of coin-type symmetric supercapacitors in ionic liquid
electrolyte
The electrochemical performances of the PGBC-based symmetric
supercapacitors in ionic liquid electrolyte were measured in a two-electrode cell
configuration (CR2032-type coin cell). The electrodes were prepared by coating the
aforementioned mixture containing active materials onto current collectors (nickel foam)
with loading mass of about 8 mg/cm2, then dried in vacuum at 120 ºC for 8 h and
pressed at 10 MPa. A neat ionic liquid of 1-Ethyl-3methylimidazolium
bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMIM TFSI) was used as the electrolyte, and a
polypropylene membrane (MPF30AC, NKK, Japan) as the separator. The coin-type
supercapacitors were finally assembled in an argon-filled glove box.
8. Please try also asymmetric device, it would be interesting to see one side active carbon,
carbon black or composites and the other side smoke-like carbon. Also provide 1000
cycles for the device as well.
Thanks to the reviewers for making such interesting suggestions and making our
research more comprehensive. We have tried to assemble the activated carbon and
acetylene respectively with CPC600s into devices and studied their electrochemical
properties. We are sorry that due to the mistakes in the experimental operation, we
can't finish the data before June 2. We will study the cyclic stability of asymmetric
devices in future research and looking forward to further communication with you.
