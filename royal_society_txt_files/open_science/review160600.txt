Not Normal: the uncertainties of scientific measurements
David C. Bailey
This paper is concerned with establishing the non-normality of scientific observations. It is
an interesting paper to read, and there is certainly a case for such a paper. I have comments
on the form of presentation, which in my opinion should be attended to before publication.
Major comments
The informal style of presentation is easy for the reader, but unacceptable to the statistician
and the users of the GUM and the VIM. Adhering to the use of internationally accepted
definitions and concepts as in the GUM and the VIM are likely to make this paper much
more acceptable and understandable.
I do not doubt that the distributions of concern are heavy-tailed, but the manner in which
they have been obtained is questionable.
(page 1, line 23 et seq) “Uncertainty-normalized differences between multiple
measurements of the same quantity follow heavy-tailed Student-t distributions that are
often almost Cauchy”. It can never be stated that data follows a particular distribution, only
that there is no reason to doubt it follows some distribution. Similar statements occur
elsewhere. Perhaps here: “… much better follow a heavy-tailed Student-t distributions than
a normal distribution …”
(4, equation 2.1) There is extreme redundancy in this measure, with repercussions as
reported. Discuss in more detail (currently only one sentence) the use of a reference value,
as indicated [16], ideally independent of the data, taking $(x_i - x_{\mathrm ref})/[u_i^2
\pm u^2(x_{\rm ref})]^{1/2}$ as appropriate. The denominator in (2.1) assumes
independence, which is incorrect. As a consequence of the lack of independence,
conclusions cannot be drawn directly from the histograms. Is the statement (4, 35) ‘… if a
quantity has 10 measurements, there are 45 possible pairs, and each entry has a weight of
10/45 …’ a suggested way of overcoming this lack? If so, the statement should be
supported.
(4, 13 and elsewhere) It is incorrect to refer to $x \pm u$ as an uncertainty. It is an interval
of values.
(4, 16) It would be much better in accordance with common practice (GUM, VIM, many
publications) to refer to $u_{\mathrm S}$ as a standard uncertainty.
(4, 17) should read ‘… with k = 1 or k = 2 standard uncertainties …’.
used in the paired comparisons.’ should be explained more explicitly.
(4, 45) Please explain more explicitly: ‘Random selection of individual measurements was
not used since it generates unrealistic z=0 values due to the same measurement sometimes
being selected twice, and also because some quantities might fail the study’s selection
criterion of having at least 5 good measurements.’
(figure 1) Displacing the four data sets seems to make a nonsense of the vertical scale.
Suggest four separate plots are presented.
(5, 39) Please explain the implications of ‘This metric is not a true chi-squared since the bins
are not independent because measurements contribute to multiple bins as part of different
permutation pairs.’
(5, 45) Please explain why ‘This correction is, however, negligible for the data reported
here.‘ is the case.
(5.47) Please explain ‘Real experimental bounds may be stronger, but a careful
measurement-by-measurement estimate of the allowed range for all quantities was beyond
the scope of this study.’ What are ‘stronger’ bounds?
(7, 22-25) I do not understand the following at all: ‘This implies that the uncertainties u in
Equation 2.1 might be better combined linearly as is appropriate for Cauchy uncertainties,
not in quadrature as for Normal uncertainties, but analysing the data with linear
uncertainties simply reduces sigma by ~ 21/2 and has negligible effect on $\nu$.’ Standard
uncertainties only combine additively when the quantities concerned are fully correlated.
Please also defend the reduction and the effect on $\nu$.
Table 2. The contents of this table are insufficiently explained in the text.
(7, 52) The sentence ‘This method is not preferred since the weighting already makes
implicit assumptions about the nature of the distribution.’ Is cryptic and could benefit from
explanation.
(16, 53 and elsewhere) Uncertainty is a measure of dispersion. Unlike a random variable, it
does not have a distribution.
Other comments
A very useful reference that considers ‘unexplained uncertainty’ is
Consider making reference to it.
Many terms and concepts are used without definition, which is dangerous, particularly in a
paper such as this. I would recommend using definitions that are largely accepted by the
scientific community such as in the GUM or the VIM. Instances:
1. Outlier (1, 22)
2. power-law distribution (1, 35)
3. Massively parallel data searches (2, 7)
4. Effect size (2, 9)
5. Uncertainty tails (2, 24)
6. Accuracy of a measurement (2, 45)
7. Unknown unknowns (2, 51)
8. High-statistics subset (3, 20)
9. Heterogeneity inconsistency index (3, 52)
10. Normal in the Gaussian limit (4, 6)
11. ‘Uncertainty evaluation’ (e.g., 4, 11) or ‘uncertainty estimation’ (e.g., 1, 17) or
‘uncertainty calculation’ (4, 38). Consider using only one term. The GUM and the
VIM prefer ‘evaluation’
12. Nominal chi-squared (5, 39)
13. Monte Carlo deconvolution (8, 33)
14. Precision (9, 30, for example) has an accepted definition in the metrology literature
(GUM, VIM, etc.). I suggest this definition is adhered to throughout the paper. It
seems to be used in various ways, which will cause considerable confusion.
15. Very non-diagonal covariance matrices (12, 49)
16. Real uncertainty (16, 49)
The abstract refers to ‘s’. Which s? Further, what is calibration of uncertainty? This usage
seems very different from instrument calibration.
‘Systematic uncertainties’ (2, 36) is a misnomer. Uncertainties are neither systematic nor
random. The errors are such [GUM, VIM]. Departure from convention is very likely to cause
confusion.
statistical or systematic, but the errors. Type A and Type B are methods of evaluation of
uncertainty, and not ‘uncertainty labels’.
The distinction between Class 2 and Class 3 systematics is unclear (2, 43).
Please explain more explicitly (3, 7-11): “Observed inconsistencies are either fixed or
included in the reported uncertainty. Unknown systematics and mistakes are constrained by
such checks, with bigger unknown systematics and mistakes more likely, but not certain, to
be noticed. The power of consistency checks is, however, limited by the impossibility of
making completely independent measurements.
PTB is referred to in full in (13, 7), but earlier by ‘PTB’. Rectify.
Editorial
The RS editorial team should comment on usage such as
1. isn’t
2. labs
3. interlab
4. split infinitives [several, e.g., “to always agree” (1, 48)]
5. ending sentences with a proposition, e.g., (15, 34)
6. starting sentences with ‘This …’ when it is not clear to what ‘this’ refers, e.g., (15, 47)

All the Reviewers’ comments are listed below along with notes on what has been revised in
response. The brief response to Reviewer 2 is at the end.
Reviewer 1 Comments
This paper is concerned with establishing the non-normality of scientific observations. It is an
interesting paper to read, and there is certainly a case for such a paper. I have comments on
the form of presentation, which in my opinion should be attended to before publication.
• I would like to thank the Reviewer for the careful reading, fair criticism, and
extremely helpful comments.
Major Comments
The informal style of presentation is easy for the reader, but unacceptable to the statistician
and the users of the GUM and the VIM. Adhering to the use of internationally accepted
definitions and concepts as in the GUM and the VIM are likely to make this paper much more
acceptable and understandable.
I do not doubt that the distributions of concern are heavy-tailed, but the manner in which they
have been obtained is questionable.
(page 1, line 23 et seq) “Uncertainty-normalized differences between multiple measurements of
the same quantity follow heavy-tailed Student-t distributions that are often almost Cauchy”.
It can never be stated that data follows a particular distribution, only that there is no reason
to doubt it follows some distribution. Similar statements occur elsewhere. Perhaps here: “...
much better follow a heavy-tailed Student-t distributions than a normal distribution ...”
• Good point: changed “follows” to “is consistent with” in the Abstract, and made
similar changes to three sentences in sections 4.4, 4.5, and in the Conclusions.
(4, equation 2.1) There is extreme redundancy in this measure, with repercussions as reported.
Discuss in more detail (currently only one sentence) the use of a reference value, as indicated
[16], ideally independent of the data, taking (xi - xref )/[u2i ± u2 (xref )]1/2 as appropriate. The
denominator in (2.1) assumes independence, which is incorrect. As a consequence of the lack
of independence, conclusions cannot be drawn directly from the histograms. Is the statement
(4, 35) ‘... if a quantity has 10 measurements, there are 45 possible pairs, and each entry has
a weight of 10/45 ...’ a suggested way of overcoming this lack? If so, the statement should
be supported.
• (Sec. 2.4 ) I may not completely understand all the Reviewer’s concerns, but
discussion of these issues has been significantly expanded later (Sec. 3.2, 3.3 ), and
referenced at this point.
(4, 13 and elsewhere) It is incorrect to refer to x ± u as an uncertainty. It is an interval of
values.
• “Uncertainties” replaced here by “Measurements with uncertainties”, and “uncer-
tainty intervals” in the following sentence.
(4, 16) It would be much better in accordance with common practice (GUM, VIM, many
publications) to refer to uS as a standard uncertainty.
(4, 17) should read ‘... with k = 1 or k = 2 standard uncertainties ...’.
• (Sec. 2.3 ) Done, but it has also been clarified that not all fields report “standard
uncertainties”, although their definitions are equivalent for Normal uncertainties.
(4, 21) ‘If there were asymmetric plus and minus uncertainties, the relevant side was always
used in the paired comparisons.’ should be explained more explicitly.
• (Sec. 2.4 ) Added a sentence to clarify by example.
(4, 45) Please explain more explicitly: ‘Random selection of individual measurements was not
used since it generates unrealistic z=0 values due to the same measurement sometimes being
selected twice, and also because some quantities might fail the study’s selection criterion of
having at least 5 good measurements.’
• (Sec. 2.4 ) A more detailed explanation is now given.
(figure 1) Displacing the four data sets seems to make a nonsense of the vertical scale. Suggest
four separate plots are presented.
• Done.
(5, 39) Please explain the implications of ‘This metric is not a true chi-squared since the bins
are not independent because measurements contribute to multiple bins as part of different
permutation pairs.’
• This has been moved to a more relevant location (Sec. 3.1 ) in the discussion of
Table 2, and additional discussion of the nominal <U+03C7>2 added there.
(5, 45) Please explain why ‘This correction is, however, negligible for the data reported here.’
is the case.
(5.47) Please explain ‘Real experimental bounds may be stronger, but a careful measurement-
by-measurement estimate of the allowed range for all quantities was beyond the scope of this
study.’ What are ‘stronger’ bounds?
• (Sec. 2.5 ) Both points addressed by expanding this paragraph with more expla-
nation.
(7, 22-25) I do not understand the following at all: ‘This implies that the uncertainties u in
Equation 2.1 might be better combined linearly as is appropriate for Cauchy uncertainties,
not in quadrature as for Normal uncertainties, but analysing the data with linear uncertainties
simply reduces sigma by ~ 21/2 and has negligible effect on <U+03BD>.’ Standard uncertainties only
combine additively when the quantities concerned are fully correlated. Please also defend the
reduction and the effect on <U+03BD>.
• (Sec. 3.2 ) A more detailed explanation is now given.
Table 2. The contents of this table are insufficiently explained in the text.
• All columns are now specifically referenced in the text atvrelevant locations, and
the explanations expanded if lacking, e.g. sx , sx , <U+03C7>2 /dof, 2.
(7, 52) The sentence “This method is not preferred since the weighting already makes im-
plicit assumptions about the nature of the distribution.” Is cryptic and could benefit from
explanation.
• (Sec. 3.2 ) A more detailed explanation is now given.
(16, 53 and elsewhere) Uncertainty is a measure of dispersion. Unlike a random variable, it
does not have a distribution.
• All references to “uncertainty distribution(s)” have been replaced by alternative
wording.
Other Comments
A very useful reference that considers ‘unexplained uncertainty’ is ‘Dark Uncertainty’ by
Thompson and Ellison. Consider making reference to it.
• (Sec. 4.1 ) Thanks for letting me know about this paper. A reference to it and
discussion have been added.
Many terms and concepts are used without definition, which is dangerous, particularly in a
paper such as this. I would recommend using definitions that are largely accepted by the
scientific community such as in the GUM or the VIM. Instances:
1. Outlier (1, 22)
• There is not room to define this in the Abstract, but it is now briefly explained in
the Introduction.
2. power-law distribution (1, 35)
• This has been better specified in the text in Sections 2.5 and 4.5.
3. Massively parallel data searches (2, 7)
• Reworded so term is unnecessary.
4. Effect size (2, 9)[black]
• Replaced with more generally understandable wording.
5. Uncertainty tails (2, 24)
• Reworded so term is unnecessary.
6. Accuracy of a measurement (2, 45)
• Uses obviously inconsistent with GUM definition have been removed or replaced.
In some cases I have kept a less precise usage of when I believe its meaning is clear
and alternate wording would be over-convoluted.
7. Unknown unknowns (2, 51)
• More explanation and example given. (Sec. 1.1 )
8. High-statistics subset (3, 20)
• Reworded so term is unnecessary.
9. Heterogeneity inconsistency index (3, 52)
• Now mathematically defined. (Sec. 2.2 )
10. Normal in the Gaussian limit (4, 6)
• Reworded with additional explanation. (Sec. 2.2 )
11. ‘Uncertainty evaluation’ (e.g., 4, 11) or ‘uncertainty estimation’ (e.g., 1, 17) or ‘uncer-
tainty calculation’ (4, 38). Consider using only one term. The GUM and the VIM prefer
‘evaluation’
• All ‘uncertainty calculation’ (and variants) and many ‘uncertainty estimation’ uses
have been replaced.
12. Nominal chi-squared (5, 39)
• Now defined (Eq. 2.3).
13. Monte Carlo deconvolution (8, 33)
• Now explained in more detail. (Sec. 3.1 )
14. Precision (9, 30, for example) has an accepted definition in the metrology literature
(GUM, VIM, etc.). I suggest this definition is adhered to throughout the paper. It seems to
be used in various ways, which will cause considerable confusion.
• “precision” has been replaced by “relative uncertainty” in this section (Sec. 3.5 ).
The labels in Fig. 3 and 4 have also been changed, and Fig. 4 incidentally rebinned
to reduce clutter. Other colloquial usages of “precision” have been replaced.
15. Very non-diagonal covariance matrices (12, 49)
• Replaced by easier-to-understand wording. (Sec. 4.2 )
16. Real uncertainty (16, 49)
• ‘Real’ removed.
The abstract refers to ‘s’. Which s? Further, what is calibration of uncertainty? This usage
seems very different from instrument calibration.
• Abstract now uses “well evaluated” instead of “well calibrated”. The brief mentions
in the abstract of “5s disagreements” and “5s discovery criterion”are now better
supported in the manuscript body. The former by an improved explanation of
Table 2, and the latter by explicit definition in the Introduction supplementing the
already extant mention and 4 references on the criterion’s history.
‘Systematic uncertainties’ (2, 36) is a misnomer. Uncertainties are neither systematic nor
random. The errors are such [GUM, VIM]. Departure from convention is very likely to cause
confusion.
• This usage has been removed from the text. (Many particle and nuclear physicists
would disagree that it is a misnomer, e.g. see the title of the article by Sinervo or
its use in the current Review of Particle Properties and the Table of Isotopes, but
that is a discussion for another time.)
Sentences (2, 37-43), I am afraid, compound the problem. It is not the uncertainties that
are statistical or systematic, but the errors. Type A and Type B are methods of evaluation of
uncertainty, and not “uncertainty labels”.
• Reworded to clarify that Type A and B refer to methods of evaluation. (Sec. 1.1 )
The distinction between Class 2 and Class 3 systematics is unclear (2, 43).
• Explanation expanded. (Sec. 1.1 )
Please explain more explicitly (3, 7-11): “Observed inconsistencies are either fixed or included
in the reported uncertainty. Unknown systematics and mistakes are constrained by such checks,
with bigger unknown systematics and mistakes more likely, but not certain, to be noticed. The
power of consistency checks is, however, limited by the impossibility of making completely
independent measurements.”
• Explanation expanded. (Sec. 1.1 )
PTB is referred to in full in (13, 7), but earlier by “PTB”. Rectify.
• Now refer to all the national labs by their full names and acronyms (which are
often more familiar) when first referenced in Sec. 3.4.
Editorial
The RS editorial team should comment on usage such as
isn’t
• Changed to “is not”.
Labs
• Replaced 8 “labs” with either “laboratories” or “institutes”, but kept 5 instances
to avoid over-repetitive use of “laboratories”, especially in the same sentence.
interlab
• “Interlab” kept as name of data set, but elsewhere replaced with “interlaboratory”.
split infinitives [several, e.g., ‘to always agree’ (1, 48)]
• I usually avoid split infinitives, but agree with Strunk & White in their classic Ele-
ments of Style that “Some infinitives seem to improve on being split”. I eliminated
one of the three cases I found, but kept the other two (“to always agree” and “to
never use”) as providing a desired emphasis on the adverb.
ending sentences with a proposition, e.g., (15, 34)
• Now reworded as a partial quote to make it clear that this usage comes from the
Royal Society Transactions paper cited here (Sec. 4.6 ).
starting sentences with ‘This ...’ when it is not clear to what ‘this’ refers, e.g., (15, 47)
• In this instance and several others, a noun or phase has been added for clarity so
“this” is now a demonstrative adjective instead of an ambiguous pronoun.
Reviewer 2 Comments
Having read and re-read the manuscript I am unable to find fault with this it. The results are
clear and fairly presented. The writing is solid, for the most part, concise.
• Thank you.
I have not checked the calculations in section (d) of the discussion and section (e) comes
across a bit speculative (or at least the connection is not made a concrete as this reviewer my
like), but these are minor concerns.
• Any calculation mistakes are, of course, my responsibility. To strengthen the
connection a bit, a few more details about highly optimized tolerance have been
added (Sec. 4.5 ), but the sparseness of relevant theoretical work makes it hard to
be very concrete.
Not Normal: the uncertainties of scientific measurements (revised version)
David C. Bailey
The author has attended to the great bulk of my comments on the first version of his paper.
He should attend to the outstanding points below. It will not be necessary for me to see the
ms again.
(page 11, line 26) Explain “analysis forest plot”.
(12, 17-19) I did not understand “If there were …” to “… =2.”. Please give some
explanation.
(16, 30) Explain how the factor 1/v2 is obtained.
(21, 38) Do not use ‘random uncertainties’! This point was made in the review of the first
version.
(21, 56) “Almost-Cauchy uncertainties” does not make sense. Surely this is a feature of a
distribution rather than an uncertainty.
(22, 19), (23, 28), (24, 14) Do not use “Normal uncertainties”. Again this is a feature of a
distribution. Also (26, 49) “uncertainties are often almost-Cauchy”; also see (21, 56).
(23, 45) “… true uncertainties t that have an unknown distribution …” is an abomination.
Change!
(23, 49) “2t2” should be parenthesized.
(24, 13), (24, 15) “uncertainties“ should be “standard uncertainties“.
(25, 50) “s can be made arbitrarily small by taking enough data” can only be true in the
absence of systematic errors. Please correct.
Response to Referee
Revised Manuscript: RSOS-160600.R1
Not Normal: Not Normal: the uncertainties of scientific measurements
by
David Bailey
The referee has again made many helpful and valid comments. These are listed below along
with the changes made to the manuscript in response. All issues raised have been addressed.
(page 11, line 26) Explain “analysis forest plot”.
• Use of ”forest plot” is unnecessary here, since the point is that multiple measurements
of the same effect were analysed, not that a forest plot was used to display the analysis,
so “analysis forest plot” has simply been replaced by “analysis”.
(12, 17-19) I did not understand If there were ... to ... =2.. Please give some explanation.
• Expanded explanation into its own paragraph. Added a reference for readers interested
in issues associated with combining asymmetric uncertainties. These lines now read:
“Uncertainties based on confidence intervals may not be symmetric about the reported value,
which is the case for about 13% of Particle, 6% of Medical, 0.3% of Nuclear, and 0.06% of
Interlab measurements. Following common (albeit imperfect) practice [42], if the reported
plus and minus uncertainties were asymmetric, zij was calculated from Eq. 2.1 using the
uncertainty for the side towards the other member of the comparison pair. vFor example,
if x1 = 80±32 , x2 = 5 15
v 100±4 , and x3 = 126±12 , then z12 = (100 - 80)/ 3 + 4 and
2 2
2
z23 = (126 - 100)/ 5 + 12 .” 2
v
(16, 30) Explain how the factor 1/ 2 is obtained.
v
• Have made explicit how the 1/ 2 is obtained. Relevant lines now read:
v
“... but even perfect anti-correlation could only decrease z values by at most a factor of 1/ 2
compared to the v uncorrelated case. (i.e. Changing cov(xi , xj ) from 0 to -ui uj in Eq. 3.1
reduces zij by 2 if ui = uj , and less if ui 6= uj .)”
(21, 38) Do not use random uncertainties! This point was made in the review of the first
version.
• This occurrence of ‘random uncertainties’ has been replaced by ‘random errors’. My
apologies for being slow to appreciate how confusing use of “random/Normal/Gaussian
uncertainties” as convenient (but formally incorrect) short-hand for the uncertainties
that parameterize a random/Normal/Gaussian dispersion of errors may be outside of
particle physics.
(21, 56) “Almost-Cauchy uncertainties” does not make sense. Surely this is a feature of a
distribution rather than an uncertainty.
• The phrase containing “Almost-Cauchy uncertainties” has been deleted as unnecessary.
(22, 19), (23, 28), (24, 14) Do not use “Normal uncertainties”. Again this is a feature of a
distribution. Also (26, 49) uncertainties are often almost-Cauchy; also see (21, 56).
• These occurrences of “Normal uncertainties” or “almost-Cauchy uncertainties” (and
several more the referee did not comment on) have been replaced by other wording.
(23, 45) ... true uncertainties t that have an unknown distribution ... is an abomination.
Change!
• This badly worded sentence has been exorcised and replaced by:
“One way is to assume that the measurement values are normally distributed with standard
deviation t that is unknown but which has a probability distribution f(t).”
(23, 49) 2t2 should be parenthesized.
• Done
(24, 13), (24, 15) “uncertainties” should be “standard uncertainties”.
• The first and last of the three occurrences of “uncertainties” on these lines have been
replaced by ”standard uncertainties”, and the middle one by ”reported uncertainties”.
(25, 50) “s can be made arbitrarily small by taking enough data” can only be true in the
absence of systematic errors. Please correct.
• Good point. “s” has been replaced by “statistical errors”.
