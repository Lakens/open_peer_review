The author try to go through the mechanism of grain growing in the 316L metal samples, which
have important applications. Part of their ideas and results are interesting but with unclear
statements.
1. The author stated "The formation of sigma and ferrite phase and controlled .." is not supported
by their PXRD results, especially the existence of sigma phase. This in very important to this
paper.
2. Please modify Figure 1a to be more readable with labels on each pattern.
3. I do not see clear difference between sigma and ferrite phase on figure 1b.
4. please modify the description through the whole paper such as in abstract : "effect the
properties" should be "affect the properties". Many things like this.

Appendix A
Thank you very much for reviewers’ valuable comments and constructive
suggestions. We have followed the instructions and revised the
manuscript. Listed below are our responses to reviewer’s comments. The
changes have been made in the manuscript
Reviewer: 1
Please check affiliation of authors.
Are there two different departments of Engineering Sciences?
Response:
The authors affiliations have been re-checked. There is a main department which is Department of
engineering sciences and mathematics and inside the department there are many divisions. One of
he divisions is “Engineering Materials”.

Comments to the Author(s)
The author try to go through the mechanism of grain growing in the 316L metal samples, which
have important applications. Part of their ideas and results are interesting but with unclear
tatements.
1. The author stated "The formation of sigma and ferrite phase and controlled .." is not supported by
heir PXRD results, especially the existence of sigma phase. This in very important to this paper.
Response:
A better XRD pattern has been added showing sigma peaks. It should be noted that the intensity of
igma peaks is low due to its low volume fraction.
XRD pattern of sample heat treated at 1100 °C. Sigma, austenite and ferrite phases are distinguished.
2. Please modify Figure 1a to be more readable with labels on each pattern.
Response:
Figure 1a has been adjusted with proper labelling and now is readable
Figure 1. a) XRD of SLM 316L heat treated (HT) at 1400 °C, 1200 °C, 1100 °C and 1000 °C, taken at room
emperature.
3. I do not see clear difference between sigma and ferrite phase on figure 1b.
Response
The etchant coloured the sigma phase in orange/brown and the ferrite phase in blue. A higher
magnification image has been added (replaced with the previous image), Fig 1b, as seen below.
Figure 1. b) Optical image showing ferrite and sigma phase shown by the arrows in SLM heat treated at 1100°C.
4. please modify the description through the whole paper such as in abstract : "effect the properties"
hould be "affect the properties". Many things like this.
Response
The text has been modified and corrected throughout the whole manuscript.
