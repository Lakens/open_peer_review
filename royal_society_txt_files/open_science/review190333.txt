Dear authors,
Thank you for this good revision of your fascinating paper. I have a few small suggestions for
your consideration.
At line 31 (penultimate of first paragraph in Introduction use 'the study .... has until'.
Lines 54 and 55 (third and fourth of second paragraph of Methods) have awkward construction:
'estimation criteria estimated from the dive parameters quantified using'. Would 'criteria
estimated from the dive parameters using' say the same thing?
At line 66, and in the caption to Fig. 1, it may be worth mentioning that group size refers to
penguins additional to the one with the AVR (at least I assume so). (Apologies that I did not
mention this earlier.)
At lines 67 and 69 (fourth and second last of third paragraph of Methods) add ':' after 'estimates'
and 'relationship'.
Line 95 (last of first paragraph of Results) - should this be 'involving seabirds other than
penguins'?
Line 102 (second last of second paragraph of Results). Should this not read 'were significantly
positively related'?
Line 109 (4 from end of p 4) could be shortened: 'SP1801 (8.9 h of recordings) included'.
Third last line on p 4 - Is this 'catches by penguins'; if so or not it should be made clear.
Second last line on p 4 - please advise what 'IQR' stands for (Again, apologies that I did not
mention this earlier.)
Line 133 (second of third paragraph in Discussion) has an errant apostrophe after 'seabirds'.
At lines 140 and 141 (at start of last paragraph), is it not possible that volant birds once in the
water could also assist in keeping a shoal corralled and near the surface? I.e. there could be cost
or benefit to penguins.
In Fig 2B is there any x for tern? (I could not spot one.) If not, this could be removed from inter
catch and the caption could be adjusted accordingly.
Thank you.

General comments
The manuscript Nº RSOS-190333 presented by Drs. McInnes and Pistorius entitled: “Up for grabs
- prey herding by penguins facilitates shallow foraging by volant seabirds”, presents novel
information obtained through footage from animal-borne video loggers mounted on a species of
penguin categorized by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as endangered; with the
intention of evaluating the foraging facilitation that these diving birds produce on other species
of volant seabirds. Although this inter-specific relation is known by anyone who inhabits or uses
pelagic marine regions (fishermen, sailors, divers, researchers, etc.), this is the first time that such
behaviour is empirically tested, as the authors very well point out. The work presents a well
formulated and parsimonious hypothesis, which was tested by contrasting its prediction against
the empirically obtained data. This makes the work epistemologically correct and neat, despite
not having a more in-depth discussion about the results found. However, and in relation to the
latter, the statistical analysis used requires a thorough revision. Especially to clarify some issues
that will be detailed in the specific comments. Finally, the most important result of this work is
the verification (albeit partial) of the role of facilitators that penguins that feed on schools have
respect to flying seabirds (and shallow divers). This is a result that highlights again the central
role that these fabulous seabirds have in the structuring and functioning of the southern marine
ecosystems. But, according to me, there are several issues to be considered, which were detailed
in the “specific comments” section, before this manuscript could be completely suitable for
publication. Please see the comments below.
Specific comments
INTRODUCTION
P2, L-WHO KNOWS (WK): "...waters [2,4].The implications", missing a space after the point.
P2, L-WK: "...upwelling ecosystem where they feed", there is an extra space before "where".
P2, L-WK: "...by analysing footage of Animal-borne video recorders (AVR)", change "Animal" by
"animal".
METHODS
Here is an important aspect to be revisited. The authors have to explain better the use of the
statistics they did. Why do they use nonparametric statistics (chi-square and Wilcoxon) to
evaluate repeated samples of particular individuals (i.e. pseudo-replication)? The authors will
understand that each bout, or independent dive, belonging to a particular individual is a pseudo-
replicate unless they use a single bout (or dive) per ID, and that is not what they did.
P3, L-WK: "We used the Kaplan-Meier estimate in R package 'survival' [13] to test for...". Why did
they use a package linked to survival to analyse the times of the first interspecific encounter? I
recommend that the authors introduce at least one line to clarify it. In addition, they must
consider if that test is possible to be used taking into account the comment above. Also, what are
4
the assumptions of this test? Do your data comply with these assumptions? If not, what did you
do to save this problem?
RESULTS
P4, L-WK: "...including 57 complete dive bouts (mean ± SD: 3 ± 5 per individual) from 19
individuals." According to this sentence, it is seen that the authors group the bouts of the 19 IDs
all together (N = 57) to perform the analyses. Would not they be incurring in pseudo-replication?
P4, L96?-102?: From "African penguin group size... (to) ... for each dive bout (Table 2)." Could the
authors see to rewrite these results through a biological/ecological interpretation of them and not
in statistical terms? The methodology used to contrast the prediction of their hypothesis is
somewhat complex so that the reader, not seasoned in these issues, can deduce from their results
the support or not to the hypothesis they are testing.
P4, L104?-107?: Exactly like this you should express the results of the previous paragraph.
Excellent.
P4, L106?: "depths > 33 m", but where does the 33 m cutting line come from? The authors do not
say where that number comes from or I cannot find it... Is it an average, a mode, or a median?
And from what?
P4, L111?: Please, define what IQR is, it is not anywhere.
DISCUSSION
In my opinion, the discussion deserves to be improved. As it is, it is merely an extension of the
results (which are rather brief...) and is not discussed with the bibliography, not even with the
one cited in the introduction.
P5, L132?-135?: The symbiotic association implies a mutual benefit. This it does not seem to be the
case, since penguins would have no benefit from the actions of flying seabird species (at least the
authors do not explain it at work). Without going any further, we have (video) records of
kleptoparasitism from gulls to penguins in these foraging flocks events (unpublished data).
P5, L138?-139?: "...in the foraging efficiency of the latter." I would add something like this: "and
an expected decrease in the energy expenditure associated to flight and diving, an onerous
investment in this group of seabirds (REFs, there is a bunch)".
P5, L140?-141?: Then you can not talk about symbiosis, in any way. It is just a positive association
or facilitation seen from the foraging ecology of flying seabirds.
P5, L142?: There is an extra space after "penguins" and before the comma.

Figure 1 - P8, L213?-214?: Authors should explain this in the methods (also).

Reviewers' report
Up for grabs - prey herding by penguins facilitates shallow foraging by volant seabirds
McInnes, AM and Pistorius, PA
The following contains responses to the referees' concerns regarding the manuscript. The authors'
responses are highlighted in bold type for each comment. Line references in the responses refer to
the revised manuscript.
Reviewer 1:
At line 31 (penultimate of first paragraph in Introduction use 'the study .... has until'.
This has been changed as recommended.
Lines 54 and 55 (third and fourth of second paragraph of Methods) have awkward construction:
'estimation criteria estimated from the dive parameters quantified using'. Would 'criteria estimated
from the dive parameters using' say the same thing?
This sentence has been changed to:
Lines 54 - 55: Calculation of the BEC followed [9] using maximum likelihood estimation criteria
calculated from the dive paramaters using R [10] package 'diveMove' [11].
At line 66, and in the caption to Fig. 1, it may be worth mentioning that group size refers to penguins
additional to the one with the AVR (at least I assume so). (Apologies that I did not mention this
earlier.)
This is no longer relevant as the statistical approach was revised in accordance with reviewer 2's
concerns.
At lines 67 and 69 (fourth and second last of third paragraph of Methods) add ':' after 'estimates'
and 'relationship'.
These have been added as suggested.
Line 95 (last of first paragraph of Results) - should this be 'involving seabirds other than penguins'?
This has been changed to:
Lines 95 - 98: Cape cormorants were recorded more frequently on the water surface than in flight,
and for all seabird groups, catch events involving volant seabirds constituted the smallest
proportion (10 %) of dive bout interactions (Figure S2).
Line 102 (second last of second paragraph of Results). Should this not read 'were significantly
positively related'?
This section has been changed to:
Lines 102 - 105: We found no significant associations between seabird encounter rates (max
number and RI) and estimates of fish abundance (Table 3). However we did find significant
positive correlations between tern and Procellariidae numbers and the maximum number of
African penguins recorded for each dive bout (Table 3).
Line 109 (4 from end of p 4) could be shortened: 'SP1801 (8.9 h of recordings) included'.
This has been changed to:
Lines 110 - 111: Footage from bird SP1801 (8.9 h of recordings) included five interspecific prey
pursuit sequences: ...
Third last line on p 4 - Is this 'catches by penguins'; if so or not it should be made clear.
This has been clarified:
Line 112: Catches by this penguin from schools were...
Second last line on p 4 - please advise what 'IQR' stands for (Again, apologies that I did not mention
this earlier.)
This has been written in full: interquartile range.
Line 133 (second of third paragraph in Discussion) has an errant apostrophe after 'seabirds'.
This has been removed as noted.
At lines 140 and 141 (at start of last paragraph), is it not possible that volant birds once in the water
could also assist in keeping a shoal corralled and near the surface? I.e. there could be cost or benefit
to penguins.
We have changed this sentence to:
Lines 152 - 153: While volant seabirds may benefit from pursuit diving species it is not clear if this
relationship incurs any disruption or benefit to the foraging abilities of the facilitating species.
In Fig 2B is there any x for tern? (I could not spot one.) If not, this could be removed from inter catch
and the caption could be adjusted accordingly.
The tern observation is at approx. 14:20 at the same time Cape cormorants and sooty shearwaters
were observed - this is clearer in the pdf version.

METHODS
Here is an important aspect to be revisited. The authors have to explain better the use of the
statistics they did. Why do they use nonparametric statistics (chi-square and Wilcoxon) to evaluate
repeated samples of particular individuals (i.e. pseudo-replication)? The authors will understand that
each bout, or independent dive, belonging to a particular individual is a pseudo-replicate unless they
use a single bout (or dive) per ID, and that is not what they did.
P3, L-WK: "We used the Kaplan-Meier estimate in R package 'survival' [13] to test for...". Why did
they use a package linked to survival to analyse the times of the first interspecific encounter? I
recommend that the authors introduce at least one line to clarify it. In addition, they must consider
if that test is possible to be used taking into account the comment above. Also, what are the
assumptions of this test? Do your data comply with these assumptions? If not, what did you do to
save this problem?
We have revised our statistical approach in order to accommodate the valid concerns by the
reviewer. We have replaced the Kaplan-Meier method with a linear mixed effects modelling
approach to accommodate the potential violation of independence of samples.
We have added the following to the text:

between time elapsed to first encounters and two measures of penguin group size (to account for
group sizes changing during a dive bout): (1) the maximum number of penguins recorded during a
dive bout (max. group size) and (2) the maximum number of penguins seen in the first 5 min of a
dive bout (initial group size). Encounter mode, i.e. flight versus surface, was included as a fixed
effect and the total number of fish caught by a penguin in a dive bout was included as a covariate
to control for potential variation in productivity and its influence on the response (see below). For
all models bird ID was included as a random effect to account for potential pseudoreplication
between observations from the same individual. All responses were log transfomed and the LMMs
were fitted using R package 'lme4' [13].
Results
Lines 98 - 102: African penguin group size was significantly inversely related to the time elapsed
from the onset of dive bouts to first encounters with volant seabirds; this relationship held for
models using both estimates of penguin group size(Table 1, Figure 1). Encounter mode had a weak
influence on this response but the total number of fish caught by penguins in a dive bout had a
significant positive influence with seabirds being encountered later in dive bouts during more
productive periods (Table1, Figure 1).
Figure 1. Influence of penguin group size (visibility) on the time elapsed since the onset of a dive
bout to the first interspecific encounter. Tests of both responses are modelled against the
maximum group size (max. group size) of penguins observed during a dive bout and the maximum
number observed during the first 5 minutes of a dive bout (initial group size). Fitted regressions
estimated from linear mixed effects models are shown for first encounters with birds in flight and
at the surface; dotted lines represent 95 % confidence intervals.

RESULTS
P4, L-WK: "...including 57 complete dive bouts (mean ± SD: 3 ± 5 per individual) from 19 individuals."
According to this sentence, it is seen that the authors group the bouts of the 19 IDs all together (N =
57) to perform the analyses. Would not they be incurring in pseudo-replication?
This has been addressed by changing the statistical approach (see above).
P4, L96?-102?: From "African penguin group size... (to) ... for each dive bout (Table 2)." Could the
authors see to rewrite these results through a biological/ecological interpretation of them and not in
statistical terms? The methodology used to contrast the prediction of their hypothesis is somewhat
complex so that the reader, not seasoned in these issues, can deduce from their results the support
or not to the hypothesis they are testing.
This has been changed to:
Lines 98- 105: African penguin group size was significantly inversely related to the time elapsed
from the onset of dive bouts to first encounters with volant seabirds; this relationship held for
models using both estimates of penguin group size(Table 1, Figure 1). Encounter mode had a weak
influence on this response but the total number of fish caught by penguins in a dive bout had a
significant positive influence with seabirds being encountered later in dive bouts during more
productive periods (Table1, Figure 1).We found no significant associations between seabird
encounter rates (max number and RI) and estimates of fish abundance (Table 3). However we did
find significant positive correlations between tern and Procellariidae numbers and the maximum
number of African penguins recorded for each dive bout (Table 3).
P4, L104?-107?: Exactly like this you should express the results of the previous paragraph. Excellent.
Thanks!
P4, L106?: "depths > 33 m", but where does the 33 m cutting line come from? The authors do not
say where that number comes from or I cannot find it... Is it an average, a mode, or a median? And
from what?
This is deduced from Table S1 which is referenced at the end of the sentence.
P4, L111?: Please, define what IQR is, it is not anywhere.
This has been spelled out in full.
DISCUSSION
In my opinion, the discussion deserves to be improved. As it is, it is merely an extension of the
results (which are rather brief...) and is not discussed with the bibliography, not even with the one
cited in the introduction.
We have added a new paragraph to the discussion:
Lines 139 - 153: During this study interspecific encounters were more frequent when proxies for
prey availability and abundance were relatively low and these encounters also occurred sooner
during a dive bout under these conditions (Table 2). This may reflect the influence of regional prey
abundance on the distribution of seabirds with higher densities of birds closely tracking fewer
patches of prey when prey availability is low (e.g. [17]). In such conditions when volant seabirds'
foraging ranges overlap those of breeding penguins it may be advantageous to actively seek out
surfacing penguins who are known to track the distribution of their prey effectively around their
colonies [15]. For Cape cormorants that breed alongside African penguins at Stony Point during
September and October this may be especially profitable. When attending young chicks, Cape
cormorants undergo frequent short foraging trips within a foraging range very similar to that of
African penguins [18]. Under the constraints of central place foraging (sensu [19]) and relatively
high energetic costs associated with high wing loading [20], to meet the energetic demands of
growing chicks, Cape cormorants may benefit from tracking the locations of foraging African
penguins when prey patches are difficult to find. Given the similarities in the distributions and diet
of African penguins and Cape cormorants [21], facilitation by the former species may play a
significant role in the foraging efficiency of the latter.

P5, L132?-135?: The symbiotic association implies a mutual benefit. This it does not seem to be the
case, since penguins would have no benefit from the actions of flying seabird species (at least the
authors do not explain it at work). Without going any further, we have (video) records of
kleptoparasitism from gulls to penguins in these foraging flocks events (unpublished data).
We have replaced this term with 'association'.
P5, L138?-139?: "...in the foraging efficiency of the latter." I would add something like this: "and an
expected decrease in the energy expenditure associated to flight and diving, an onerous investment
in this group of seabirds (REFs, there is a bunch)".
We have added the following sentence which incorporates this and other aspects related to
energetic costs:
Lines 147 - 150: Under the constraints of central place foraging (sensu [19]) and relatively high
energetic costs associated with high wing loading [20], to meet the energetic demands of growing
chicks, Cape cormorants may benefit from tracking the locations of foraging African penguins
when prey patches are difficult to find.
P5, L140?-141?: Then you can not talk about symbiosis, in any way. It is just a positive association or
facilitation seen from the foraging ecology of flying seabirds.
We have omitted any mention of symbiosis.
P5, L142?: There is an extra space after "penguins" and before the comma.
This has been removed.
