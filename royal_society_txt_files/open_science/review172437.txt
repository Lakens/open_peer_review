Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The manuscript by Dewaele and colleagues redescribes several fossil monachines from the
Neogene of North Atlantic and Mediterranean. It is a very interesting work that provides
important contributions to clarify the problematic systematic framework of these fragmentary
fossil assemblages. Moreover the result of this study is crucial to the reconstruction of the first
steps of the monachines diversification leading to the extant wide diversity of these pinnipeds.
The paper should be publishable pending some revisions.
General comments:
Most of the fossils examined consist of fragmentary remains with problematic systematic
assignation. I agree with the authors that several papers published in the past have not adopted a
rigorous approach (e.g. I agree to avoid the use of ecomorphotypes) but I suggest more caution to
waste names of taxa previously assigned (e.g. Messiphoca) and to better support the reasons for
considering as diagnostic a bone element and for refusing others. Concerning this second point, I
noted that the authors outline several time in the manuscript that the humerus is the most
diagnostic postcranial bone but without reporting sufficient support (also references) to motivate
this affirmation. As this regard, the figure 10 showing the general outlines of some extant humeri
briefly discussed in the discussion paragraph is, in my opinion, not easy to understand and
insufficient to clarify the diagnostic value of the humeri. The two new species described
(Auroraphoca atlantica and Virginiaphoca magurai) are diagnosed respectively on three and four
characters of the humeri: are these or other characters not subject to intraspecific variation in the
extant monachine/pinnipeds? I presume that the authors checked a sufficiently wide sample of
humeri of extant pinnipeds to motivate these diagnoses. If it is true, it would be useful to outline
this fact and to provide precise data in the materials and methods section. Morphometric analysis
proposed as future purpose by the authors could be a useful approach to further support the
validity of the species, but firstly the species must be validated by the characters listed in the
diagnosis. Similarly, to affirm that other postcranial bones have lower diagnostic values and to
refuse the species based on these bones must be supported with solid data based on observation
of a wide sample of specimens belonging to extant species.
The stratigraphical setting of the whole monachine assemblage here examined evidences that the
Pliophoca etrusca from the Mediterranean (including referred fragmentary material) is from the
late Pliocene whereas all the fossil monachines from North Atlantic are from late Miocene-early
Pliocene. These different ages should be better outlined when the Mediterranean and the Atlantic
monachinae are compared.
General organization of the manuscript:
On the whole it is fine, but some parts are repeated several times, weighing down the reading
and making the text less clear. In particular, the taxa and the specimens considered are listed and
described in detail both in the 'Methods and Materials' and in the 'Systematic Paleontology'
paragraphs. In my opinion, the sections 'Taxa considered' and 'Biological sample' in the 'Methods
3
and Materials' paragraph could be eliminated by transferring in the systematic paragraph the few
information not already repeated.
The references to the intraspecific variability in the humeri of the extant monachines and the
relative figure 10 (if maintained) should be placed to the 'Methods and Materials' paragraph
rather than to the 'Discussion' paragraph.
Systematics:
It would be useful at the beginning of the respective diagnosis to list the characters supporting
the assignation of the new species Auroraphoca atlantica and Virginiaphoca magurai to the
Monachinae (in synthesis: what are the characters allowing to refer these humeri to a
monachine?) .
Since the paratype of Auroraphoca atlantica besides the humerus, includes a left scapula and a
left ulna, are some characters of these bones significant for the diagnosis?
The authors do not change the diagnosis of Pliophoca etrusca emended by Berta et al. (2015).
Perhaps it would be useful to add other characters for the humerus since Berta et al. listed only a
character for this bone ('supinator ridge on humerus absent or poorly developed').
English and style:
Please check carefully that everything is in British English, as indicated in the guides for authors
(I found some words in US English language)
In several cases it seems that 'specimens' has been used incorrectly to indicate 'bones' (please
check)
References:
The list of references is appropriate and exhaustive. However, it may be useful to mention the
following paper which describes several humeri of monachines (although not from the North
Atlantic):
Valenzuela-Toro, AM, Pyenson, ND, Gutstein, CS, Suárez, ME. A new dwarf seal from the late
Neogene of South America and the evolution of pinnipeds in the southern hemisphere. Papers in
Palaeontology 2 (1), 101-115, 2016. 6, 2016.
In addition, the authors may not be aware of a remain (though very fragmentary) of
Mediterranean Tortonian monachine reported and figured in this work:
Bianucci, G., M. Gatt, R. Catanzariti, S. Sorbi, C. G. Bonavia, R. Curmi, and A. Varola. 2011.
Systematics, biostratigraphy and evolutionary pattern of the Oligo-Miocene marine mammals
from the Maltese Islands. Geobios 44: 549-585.
Figures:
All illustrations are of good quality and all necessary with the exception of figure 10 that in my
opinion is poorly informative (see other comments above).
I have a strong doubt: some months ago I gave many photos of Italian fossil monachines to one of
the authors (DL) to be used for comparison. Several of these illustrations were those I cut and
prepared for the tables of the work on the Pliophoca etrusca I published together with Annalisa
4
Berta and colleagues in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Since Dewaele and colleagues
include several of these cut and prepared photos in their figures (figs. 2E, 3E, 4E, 5E, 6D, 6E, 6F,
7D, 7E, 8E, 8F, 9E), I wonder if it is necessary for them to report in the captions something as
'modified from Berta et al., 2015'. This especially because a publishing copyright issue, since the
same photos have already been published in JVP. Alternatively, the authors could replace these
photos with others made by them.
Other more punctual corrections and comments are reported in the annotated manuscript. (Appendix A)
In conclusion, I support the publication of this manuscript after some revisions mainly regarding
to better motivate the choice of the humerus alone as only diagnostic postcranial bone.

The ms. is well organized and written and provides excellent detailed descriptions of new fossil
monachine seals in the North Atlantic. The paper also reviews and reevaluates the status of
numerous purported fossil monachines which represents a significant contribution to monachine
taxonomy. I applaud the authors' conservative approach to fossil phocid taxonomy. Although the
problematic stratigraphic provenance of the Belgian material is detailed it remains that an
isolated postcranial element--humerus was confirmed as the basis for lectotype assignment.
While I appreciate the authors' rationale for doing this I note as do the authors that thorough
5
comparisons of postcrania among both fossil and Recent phocids is much needed to evauate intra
vs interspecific variation A. Berta

Neogene of North Atlantic and Mediterranean. It is a very interesting work that provides
important contributions to clarify the problematic systematic framework of these fragmentary
fossil assemblages. Moreover the result of this study is crucial to the reconstruction of the first
steps of the monachines diversification leading to the extant wide diversity of these pinnipeds.
The paper should be publishable pending some revisions.

General comments:
Most of the fossils examined consist of fragmentary remains with problematic systematic
assignation. I agree with the authors that several papers published in the past have not adopted a
rigorous approach (e.g. I agree to avoid the use of ecomorphotypes) but I suggest more caution to
waste names of taxa previously assigned (e.g. Messiphoca) and to better support the reasons for
considering as diagnostic a bone element and for refusing others. Concerning this second point, I
noted that the authors outline several time in the manuscript that the humerus is the most
diagnostic postcranial bone but without reporting sufficient support (also references) to motivate
this affirmation. As this regard, the figure 10 showing the general outlines of some extant humeri
briefly discussed in the discussion paragraph is, in my opinion, not easy to understand and
insufficient to clarify the diagnostic value of the humeri. The two new species described
(Auroraphoca atlantica and Virginiaphoca magurai) are diagnosed respectively on three and four
characters of the humeri: are these or other characters not subject to intraspecific variation in the
extant monachine/pinnipeds? I presume that the authors checked a sufficiently wide sample of
humeri of extant pinnipeds to motivate these diagnoses. If it is true, it would be useful to outline
this fact and to provide precise data in the materials and methods section. Morphometric analysis
proposed as future purpose by the authors could be a useful approach to further support the
validity of the species, but firstly the species must be validated by the characters listed in the
diagnosis. Similarly, to affirm that other postcranial bones have lower diagnostic values and to
refuse the species based on these bones must be supported with solid data based on observation
of a wide sample of specimens belonging to extant species.
The stratigraphical setting of the whole monachine assemblage here examined evidences that the
Pliophoca etrusca from the Mediterranean (including referred fragmentary material) is from the
late Pliocene whereas all the fossil monachines from North Atlantic are from late Miocene-early
Pliocene. These different ages should be better outlined when the Mediterranean and the Atlantic
monachinae are compared.
General organization of the manuscript:
On the whole it is fine, but some parts are repeated several times, weighing down the reading
and making the text less clear. In particular, the taxa and the specimens considered are listed and
described in detail both in the 'Methods and Materials' and in the 'Systematic Paleontology'
paragraphs. In my opinion, the sections 'Taxa considered' and 'Biological sample' in the 'Methods
and Materials' paragraph could be eliminated by transferring in the systematic paragraph the few
information not already repeated.
The references to the intraspecific variability in the humeri of the extant monachines and the
relative figure 10 (if maintained) should be placed to the 'Methods and Materials' paragraph
rather than to the 'Discussion' paragraph.
Systematics:
It would be useful at the beginning of the respective diagnosis to list the characters supporting
the assignation of the new species Auroraphoca atlantica and Virginiaphoca magurai to the
Monachinae (in synthesis: what are the characters allowing to refer these humeri to a
monachine?) .
Since the paratype of Auroraphoca atlantica besides the humerus, includes a left scapula and a
left ulna, are some characters of these bones significant for the diagnosis?
14
The authors do not change the diagnosis of Pliophoca etrusca emended by Berta et al. (2015).
Perhaps it would be useful to add other characters for the humerus since Berta et al. listed only a
character for this bone ('supinator ridge on humerus absent or poorly developed').
English and style:
Please check carefully that everything is in British English, as indicated in the guides for authors
(I found some words in US English language)
In several cases it seems that 'specimens' has been used incorrectly to indicate 'bones' (please
check)
References:
The list of references is appropriate and exhaustive. However, it may be useful to mention the
following paper which describes several humeri of monachines (although not from the North
Atlantic):
Valenzuela-Toro, AM, Pyenson, ND, Gutstein, CS, Suárez, ME. A new dwarf seal from the late
Neogene of South America and the evolution of pinnipeds in the southern hemisphere. Papers in
Palaeontology 2 (1), 101-115, 2016. 6, 2016.
In addition, the authors may not be aware of a remain (though very fragmentary) of
Mediterranean Tortonian monachine reported and figured in this work:
Bianucci, G., M. Gatt, R. Catanzariti, S. Sorbi, C. G. Bonavia, R. Curmi, and A. Varola. 2011.

from the Maltese Islands. Geobios 44: 549-585.
Figures:
All illustrations are of good quality and all necessary with the exception of figure 10 that in my
opinion is poorly informative (see other comments above).
I have a strong doubt: some months ago I gave many photos of Italian fossil monachines to one of
the authors (DL) to be used for comparison. Several of these illustrations were those I cut and
prepared for the tables of the work on the Pliophoca etrusca I published together with Annalisa
Berta and colleagues in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Since Dewaele and colleagues
include several of these cut and prepared photos in their figures (figs. 2E, 3E, 4E, 5E, 6D, 6E, 6F,
7D, 7E, 8E, 8F, 9E), I wonder if it is necessary for them to report in the captions something as
'modified from Berta et al., 2015'. This especially because a publishing copyright issue, since the
same photos have already been published in JVP. Alternatively, the authors could replace these
photos with others made by them.
Other more punctual corrections and comments are reported in the annotated manuscript.
In conclusion, I support the publication of this manuscript after some revisions mainly regarding
to better motivate the choice of the humerus alone as only diagnostic postcranial bone.

The ms. is well organized and written and provides excellent detailed descriptions of new fossil
monachine seals in the North Atlantic. The paper also reviews and reevaluates the status of
numerous purported fossil monachines which represents a significant contribution to monachine
taxonomy. I applaud the authors' conservative approach to fossil phocid taxonomy. Although the
problematic stratigraphic provenance of the Belgian material is detailed it remains that an
isolated postcranial element--humerus was confirmed as the basis for lectotype assignment.
While I appreciate the authors' rationale for doing this I note as do the authors that thorough
comparisons of postcrania among both fossil and Recent phocids is much needed to evauate intra
vs interspecific variation A. Berta

35
36
37
38
While the diversity of ‘southern seals’, or Monachinae, in the North Atlantic realm is
39
40
41 currently limited to the Mediterranean monk seal, Monachus monachus, their
42
43 diversity was much higher during the late Miocene and Pliocene. Although the fossil
44
45 record of Monachinae from the North Atlantic is mainly composed of isolated
46
47 specimens, many taxa have been erected on the basis of fragmentary and
48
49 incomparable specimens. The humerus is commonly considered the most diagnostic
50
51
postcranial bone. The research presented in this study limits the selection of type
52
53
54 specimens for different fossil Monachinae to humeri and questions fossil taxa that
55
56 have other types of bones as type specimens, such as for Terranectes parvus. In

Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 2 of 76

2
3 addition, it is essential that the humeri selected as type specimens are (almost)
4
5 complete. This questions the validity of partial humeri selected as type specimens,
6
7 such as for Terranectes magnus. This study revises Callophoca obscura, Homiphoca
8
9 capensis and Pliophoca etrusca, all allegedly known from the Lee Creek Mine,
10
11
Aurora, North Carolina, in addition to their respective type localities in Belgium, South
12
13
14 Africa, and Italy, respectively. C. obscura is retained as a monachine seal taxon that
15
16 lived both on the eastcoast of North America and in the North Sea Basin. However,
17
18 H. capensis from North America cannot be identified beyond the genus level, and
19
20 specimens previously assigned to P. etrusca from North America clearly belong to
21
22 different taxa. Indeed, we also present new material and describe two new genera of
23
24
late Miocene and Pliocene Monachine from the eastcoast of North America:
25
26
27 Auroraphoca atlantica nov. gen. et nov. sp., and Virginiaphoca magurai nov. gen. et
28
29 nov. sp. This shows a much higher endemism of late Neogene Monachinae from the
30
31 eastcoast of North America than previously expected.

Among the semi-aquatic carnivoran clade of Pinnipedia, the family of true seals, or
9
10 Phocidae are remarkable for their biogeography. Phocidae are usually subdivided
11
12 into two subfamilies, the ‘southern seals,’ or Monachinae; and the ‘northern seals’, or
13
14 Phocinae, see [1]. This reflects the current biogeography of both subfamilies, in
15
16 which extant Monachinae include the Mediterranean to tropical monk seals, the
17
18 elephant seals along the eastern shores of the Pacific Ocean, and the elephant
19
20
seals, leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli),
21
22
23 crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophaga), and Ross seal (Ommatophoca rossi) in the
24
25 Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters. Phocinae, on the other hand, are largely
26
27 restricted to the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans and the Arctic Ocean.
28
29 However, the fossil record from the late Neogene shows that ‘southern seals’ were
30
31 much more common and diverse in the North Atlantic realm than they are today [2–
32
33
4].
34
35
36 Molecular evidence indicates that stem phocids diverged from other pinnipeds
37
38 around 23 Ma, at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary, but crown phocids, comprising
39
40 the two subfamilies Monachinae and Phocinae, diverge in the middle Miocene
41
42 around 16 Ma [5]. Yet, the oldest unequivocal phocid fossils may have a Chattian?–
43
44 Burdigalian age (late Oligocene-early Miocene); and have been found in the
45
46
Mediterranean [6; LD, pers. obs., 2017]. Throughout the middle and late Miocene
47
48
49 and early Pliocene, phocid taxa underwent (at least) one dispersal event across the
50
51 North Atlantic Ocean: Leptophoca proxima and Monotherium aberratum from the
52
53 early to middle Miocene and late Miocene, respectively, are known from both sides of
54
55 the North Atlantic [7, 8], and many of the extinct phocid taxa described from the late

3 Miocene and early Pliocene of the southern North Sea Basin by Van Beneden [2, 3]
4
5 have also been identified in the early Pliocene of North Carolina, USA [4]. However,
6
7 subtle differences between specimens identified as the same taxon from across the
8
9 Atlantic have led authors to code them as separate Operational Taxonic Units
10
11
(OTUs) in phylogenetic analyses [9]. Moreover, not all extinct phocid species have
12
13
14 been found on both sides of the Atlantic, notably the enigmatic Nanophoca
15
16 vitulinoides from the southern North Sea Basin [8].
17
18 Therefore, a revision of the different phocid OTUs from the North Atlantic realm is
19
20 required in order to obtain a more conclusive view on their diversity and
21
22 paleobiogeography. The abundance of monachines in the North Atlantic temperate
23
24
latitudes during the late Miocene-early Pliocene is particularly interesting given that
25
26
27 they are conspicuously absent from this region today; modern monachines are
28
29 restricted to the Mediterranean and Caribbean seas, Hawaii and the eastern Pacific,
30
31 and Antarctic and sub Antarctic waters (e.g., [1, 10]).
32
33 In this study, we reassess the humeri of the three taxa of monachine seals from the
34
35 Neogene of the North Atlantic realm: Callophoca obscura, Homiphoca capensis, and
36
37
Pliophoca etrusca [2–4, 7, 9, 11]. Humeri are selected and considered for two
38
39
40 reasons. First, humeri are considered the most diagnostic postcranial bones in
41
42 Phocidae [12]. Given the overall scarcity of more diagnostic cranial specimens, a
43
44 taxonomy based on the most complete humeri possible is required to properly
45
46 identify and compare phocid taxa. Second, due to their robust nature, humeri are
47
48 among the most commonly preserved fossil phocid bones. This is clearly
49
50
advantageous over using less diagnostic types of bone that are more rarely
51
52
53
preserved in the fossil record. Two other Monachinae, Afrophoca libyca and
54
55 Monotherium gaudini are known only from cranial elements [6, 13; LD, pers. obs.,

Page 5 of 76 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
5

2
3 2017] and will not be discussed in this study. A revision of M. gaudini by LD and
4
5 colleagues is currently in review. Furthermore, A. libyca is Burdigalian in age (early
6
7 Miocene, c. 19 Ma) [6] and M. gaudini may range from the Chattian (late Oligocene)
8
9 to the Aquitanian (early Miocene) [14, 15; LD, pers. obs., 2017]; therefore, neither is
10
11
within the scope of this study.
12
13
14 Messiphoca mauretanica from the Messinian (upper Miocene) of Algeria [16] and
15
16 Terranectes spp. from the upper Miocene of Maryland, USA [17] have formerly been
17
18 identified as Monachinae from the North Atlantic realm, with a known humerus, but
19
20 they are problematic for various reasons. The poorly-studied Messiphoca
21
22 mauretanica is represented by an associated left humerus, left ulna, left radius, and
23
24
six dorsal vertebrae (MNHN.F.ORN1, holotype) [16]. An isolated partial skull
25
26
27 (MNHN.F.ORN2, paratype) has been described as well. To date, no other specimens
28
29 of M. mauretanica are known. Given the overall relatively poor quality of the small
30
31 fossil record of M. mauretanica, this taxon needs a formal revision prior to any other
32
33 further research involving this taxon. It is plausible that M. mauretanica is merely a
34
35 junior synonym of either Callophoca obscura or Pliophoca etrusca. Nevertheless, in
36
37
this study, M. mauretanica will be considered for comparison purposes because of
38
39
40 the association of multiple bones in the holotype (MNHN.F.ORN1).
41
42 The genus Terranectes was recently described, based on isolated material from the
43
44 Chesapeake Bay Area, Maryland, USA. Issues regarding the incomparability of both
45
46 species to each other and to other known taxa make comparison impossible. Rahmat
47
48 et al. [17] invoke Koretsky’s [12] ecomorphotype hypothesis to support the
49
50
designation of isolated specimens of different types of bone to different taxa.
51
52
53
Koretsky’s [12] ecomorphotype hypothesis is constructed for mandibles, humeri and
54
55 femora. Currently, this hypothesis has been inadequately tested to be considered as

3 a diagnostic tool, especially with regard to postcranial bones other than humeri and
4
5 femora, which have not been considered in the original study by Koretsky [12]. For T.
6
7 magnus, the holotype specimen CMM-V-4710, is a partial humerus. However,
8
9 although humeri are usually considered the most diagnostic postcranial bones in
10
11
Phocidae, the holotype specimen of T. magnus is exceedingly incomplete, inhibiting
12
13
14 proper comparison with other taxa (see below). Therefore, we deem that there is no
15
16 scientific basis to support the assumption that the isolated specimens of both T.
17
18 magnus and T. parvus indeed belong to the same genus. Pending future discoveries,
19
20 the genus Terranectes should be considered a nomen dubium.
21
22 We also present new fossil phocid material from the east coast of North America,
23
24
dredged off the Nottoway River bed west of Franklin, Virginia, USA. Previous
25
26
27 research already showed that the Chowan River tributaries, including the Nottoway
28
29 and Meherrin rivers yield a large number of vertebrate fossils, including the type and
30
31 only known specimen from the inoid odontocete Meherrinia isoni Geisler et al., 2012.

20 Fossil specimen sample
21
22 This study includes all late Miocene-early Pliocene Monachinae from the North
23
24
Atlantic realm that are known from substantial material in the fossil record:
25
26
27 Callophoca obscura, Homiphoca capensis, and Pliophoca etrusca.
28
29
30
31 Taxa considered. Callophoca obscura is currently known from four humeri
32
33 specimens from the IRSNB collection, including the lectotype IRSNB 1198-M203, the
34
35 juvenile specimen IRSNB 1116-M188 which was originally assigned to Palaeophoca
36
37
nystii, and specimens IRSNB 1156-M177 and IRSNB VERT-17172-301b which were
38
39
40 originally assigned to Mesotaria ambigua [3]. Other humeri from Belgium that have
41
42 previously been assigned to C. obscura are poorly preserved and cannot be
43
44 assigned to the taxon with certainty. While the collection of humeri of C. obscura from
45
46 the east coast of North America is represented by abundant complete and
47
48 subcomplete specimens ([4]; CMP and LD, pers. obs., 2017), primarily from the Lee
49
50
Creek Mine, Aurora, North Carolina, U.S.A, but also from other localities in North
51
52
53
Carolina and Florida, the lectotype specimen from Belgium is an isolated partial
54
55 humerus (IRSNB 1198-M203). Virtually all specimens from both sides of the Atlantic

3 Ocean have been found isolated. Koretsky and Ray [4] synonymized C. obscura and
4
5 M. ambigua because they observed no anatomical differences other than size,
6
7 arguing that size difference alone represents sexual dimorphism: the smaller C.
8
9 obscura are proposed to represent females and the larger M. ambigua are proposed
10
11
to represent males of the same species. Although Koretsky and Ray [4] consider the
12
13
14 collections of both sides of the Atlantic to represent C. obscura, Berta et al. [9] noted
15
16 marked differences between both collections but considered C. obscura a nomen
17
18 dubium. However, the Berta et al. [9] study does not include the ‘original’ Belgian
19
20 collection of C. obscura in their phylogenetic analysis ([9]: fig. 15), nor do they
21
22 provide any other evidence for their interpretation. The present study aims to revise
23
24
the fossil record of C. obscura from both sides of the Atlantic in order to be more
25
26
27 conclusive on the taxonomic relationship between the monachine fossil records on
28
29 both sides.
30
31 Homiphoca capensis is represented by more than three thousand specimens from
32
33 the ‘E’ Quarry, Langebaanweg, South Africa [20-22], and a handful of isolated
34
35 specimens from the Lee Creek Mine in North Carolina [4]. However, this identification
36
37
by Koretsky and Ray [4] is very tentative given that the exact taxonomy of the South
38
39
40 African material is uncertain: Govender et al. [22] and Govender [23] indicate the
41
42 presence of several closely related taxa among the collection of South African H.
43
44 capensis, based on the observation of two different morphotypes in the postcranial
45
46 material, and possibly three, based on the variation in cranial anatomy of multiple
47
48 skulls. In the present study, we reconsider the H. capensis material from Lee Creek
49
50
Mine and compare it to the two morphotypes of postcrania of H. capensis from South
51
52
53
Africa.

3 The holotype and only European specimen of Pliophoca etrusca comprises a partial
4
5 but relatively complete skeleton (MSNUP I-13993) from Tuscany, Italy, including a
6
7 partial skull, limb bones, and vertebral bodies [9, 11]. A partial mandible from Orciano
8
9 Pisano and a very fragmentary skeleton, including a partial mandible and pedal
10
11
bones from near Saline di Volterra, are housed at the Museo di Geologia e
12
13
14 Paleontologia in Florence and have been found isolated and referred to as Pliophoca
15
16 cf. P. etrusca [9]; yet no mandibles are associated with the holotype or with any other
17
18 specimen that can be compared to the holotype. Koretsky and Ray [4] presented 171
19
20 specimens of P. etrusca from different localities in North Carolina and Florida: mostly
21
22 isolated specimens, but also including one associated scapula, humerus, radius, and
23
24
ulna (USNM 250290), and one associated humerus and femur (USNM 374222).
25
26
27 Furthermore, this collection includes 16 maxillae, 8 isolated maxillary teeth, 44
28
29 mandibles, 18 isolated mandibular teeth, 35 humeri, 24 radii, and 17 femora, based
30
31 on the study by Koretsky and Ray [4]. However, preliminary observations revealed
32
33 substantial differences between the North American referred specimens from
34
35 Koretsky and Ray [4] and the Italian holotype [9]. Therefore, we deem it appropriate
36
37
to reassess the fossil record of P. etrusca from the west coast of the North Atlantic.

3 above, the Scaldisian is currently considered an obsolete term and active use has
4
5 been discontinued [25]. Different authors assign different ages and stratigraphic
6
7 intervals to the Scaldisian [25: tab. 1], but in general, it is considered that the
8
9 Scaldisian is roughly equivalent to the early Pliocene Kattendijk Formation. However,
10
11
many phocid fossils from the “Scaldisian” show signs of reworking [18]. Most of the
12
13
14 vertebrate remains recovered from the Kattendijk Formation come from the basal
15
16 gravel [26], suggesting reworking of many of the specimens from the underlying
17
18 Deurne Sands Member of the Diest Formation (late Miocene) or from the latest
19
20 Miocene-earliest Pliocene depositional hiatus between the Diest and Kattendijk
21
22 formations. The recent redescription of Nanophoca vitulinoides showed that this
23
24
taxon actually lived during the Miocene and that most specimens of N. vitulinoides
25
26
27 are Miocene in age but reworked into the early Pliocene basal gravel of the
28
29 Kattendijk Formation [18]. Hence, the historical age determinations should be
30
31 considered with care. For the Yorktown Formation, Ward and Blackwelder [27] state
32
33 a Zanclean (early Pliocene) age for the formation in the Chesapeake Bay.
34
35 Radiometric dating of the Rushmere Member, the second oldest member of the
36
37
Yorktown Formation, returned an age of 4.4 +/- 0.2 Ma [29]. They also considered
38
39
40 the basal strata of the Yorktown Formation, the Sunken Meadow Member, equivalent
41
42 to foraminiferal zone D18, with an onset at 5.0 Ma, unconformably overlying the 6.46
43
44 Ma upper strata of the Eastover Formation.

3 Unfortunately, the revision of C. obscura humeri proved that the latter specimen
4
5 cannot be assigned to the species unambiguously. Both sediment samples return a
6
7 Messinian age (latest Miocene), which can be regarded as a minimum age of the C.
8
9 obscura specimens. However, because reworking of dinoflagellate cysts has been
10
11
detected, it is impossible to elucidate an absolute age interval.

16 Homiphoca capensis. An age of 5.15 +/- 0.1 Ma (earliest Zanclean, earliest
17
18 Pliocene) had been proposed for the Langeberg quartzose sand and Muishond
19
20 Fontein peletal phosphorite members of the South African Varswater Formation,
21
22 containing virtually all South African Homiphoca capensis specimens [21, 22; 28, and
23
24
references therein]. A number of phocid specimens from the Yorktown Formation at
25
26
27 Lee Creek Mine, Aurora, North Carolina have been assigned to Homiphoca capensis
28
29 [4], despite the strong geographic differences between the east coast of North
30
31 America and the only other known (type) locality of H. capensis, the ‘E’ Quarry at
32
33 Langebaanweg, northwest of Cape Town, South Africa. Others disagree with the
34
35 identification of H. capensis from North America. Nevertheless, the age of the
36
37
Yorktown Formation roughly corresponds with the LQSM and the MPPM from South
38
39
40 Africa. The latter center around 5.15 Ma [28], while Ward and Blackwelder [27] show
41
42 that the basal Sunken Meadow Member of the Yorktown Formation has been dated
43
44 to 5.0 Ma using foraminifera biostratigraphy and Akers [29] presented a
45
46 radiometrically-measured age of 4.4 +/- 0.2 Ma for the overlying Rushmere Member
47
48 of the Yorktown Formation. Despite the difference, LQSM, MPPM, and the Yorktown
49
50
Formation are entirely Zanclean in age.

13
14 historical background of the North American specimens of “Pliophoca etrusca” is
15
16 identical to the background of the North American specimens of Homiphoca
17

33 Creek Mine in Aurora, Beaufort County, North Carolina. As has been noted above,
34
35 the fossiliferous stratum at the Lee Creek Mine is the early Pliocene Yorktown

38

3 attached to the specimens that could be used in elucidating its lithostratigraphic or
4
5 biostratigraphic origin. However, the specimen shows only few signs of rolling, and
6
7 hence, fluviatile transport of the specimen must have been limited. The possible
8
9 stratigraphic provenance covers the upper Miocene Cobham Bay Member (CMB) of
10
11
the Eastover Formation and the lower Pliocene Yorktown Formation (Fig. 2), since
12
13
14 both outcrop in the river banks and riverbed of the Nottoway River in the Franklin
15
16 area [27]. A similar strategy had been employed to ‘date’ the fossils of the river
17
18 dolphin Meherrinia isoni from the nearby Meherrin River in North Carolina [31]. The
19
20 Yorktown is dated to the Zanclean [27]. Ward and Blackwelder [27] also presented
21
22 an age of 8.7 +/- 0.4 Ma for the lower levels of the CMB, and 6.46 +/- 0.15 Ma for
23
24
subsurface sampling of this member, based on radiometric dating of glauconite.
25
26
27 Hence, the CMB is of late Tortonian to Messinian age (late Miocene). Although
28
29 colour of a fossil bone is only a weak basis to support correlation with a given
30
31 stratum, specimen USNM 639750 is dark gray with orange stains. And while the
32
33 majority of the bones from the Yorktown Formation in the Lee Creek Mine are more
34
35 yellow to beige in colour, Ward and Blackwelder [27:20] argue that the CMB is
36
37
“Grayish blue (5 PB 5/2) where fresh, the Cobham Bay sediments weather to a
38
39
40 yellowish orange (10 YR 8/6).” This description of the colour of the CBM corresponds
41
42 with the observed colour pattern of specimen USNM 639750. Currently, no
43
44 specimens that have been recovered from the Yorktown Formation at the Lee Creek
45
46 Mine can be attributed to V. magurai. Although the latter does not prove the absence
47
48 of the species throughout the entire Yorktown Formation elsewhere, it further
49
50
arguments that the CBM is the more likely origin of the type specimen.

31 Diagnosis. Large monachine seal, comparable in size to Hydrurga leptonyx.
32
33 Callophoca obscura differs from other extinct Monachinae by the presence of
34
35 a lesser tubercle that exceeds the proximal level of the humeral head (except
36
37
Virginiaphoca magurai, newly described taxon in this study), and a
38
39
40 deltopectoral crest that is both broad and subtriangular in lateral view. Differs
41
42 from all extant Monachinae by the smaller anterior projection of the
43
44 deltopectoral crest and less curving distal termination of the deltopectoral
45
46 crest. Additionally differs from Hydrurga leptonyx and Leptonychotes weddelli

10
11
However, it should be noted that this type locality is derived from the original
12
13
14 labels associated to the specimen. In his original publications Van Beneden [2,
15
16 3] did not discuss the geographic provenance of individual specimens of the
17
18 original fossil record of Callophoca obscura.
19
20 Van Beneden (unpublished data) assigned the specimen IRSNB 1198-M203
21
22 to the “Scaldisien” (Scaldisian). However, as mentioned above the Scaldisian
23
24
is currently considered an obsolete term and the name is no longer used [25].
25
26
27 In addition, many of the apparently Scaldisian phocid remains show signs of
28
29 reworking and for Nanophoca vitulinoides it has already been shown that the
30
31 actual fossil record is older than the Pliocene range that is commonly accepted
32
33 for Scaldisian phocids [18 contra 4]. Indeed, dinoflagellate cyst biostratigraphy
34
35 of sediment sample associated with C. obscura (specimen IRSNB 1156-M177)
36
37
suggests a Messinian age for the sediment sample, thus mostly likely

10
11
Comments. Historically, Callophoca obscura is a very well-known phocid from the
12
13
14 southern margin of the North Sea Basin (i.e., Belgium) and the Lee Creek
15
16 Mine from North Carolina, USA, yielding well over one thousand isolated
17
18 specimens of the North Atlantic Ocean, including a rare partial skull from North
19
20 America (USNM 475486) [e.g., 2–4; CMP and LD, pers. obs., 2017]. As a
21
22 result, C. obscura has been considered in many phylogenetic analyses of
23
24
Phocidae, and Monachinae in particular [e.g., 9, 12, 33–36]. However, all
25
26
27 specimens that have diagnostic value (i.e., skull, humeri, femora) have been
28
29 found isolated, and only humeri can be compared to the lectotype humerus. All
30
31 other types of bones have only tentatively been assigned to C. obscura in the
32
33 past of the basis of the size of the specimens and the relative abundances in
34
35 collections [e.g., 3, 4]. Although it is likely that most of these specimens indeed
36
37
belong C. obscura, we hold on to a conservative approach and reasssign all
38
39
40 non-humerus specimens from C. obscura as Monachinae indet. An individual
41
42 re-assessment of all specimens is beyond the scope of this study and we limit
43
44 our research to the humeri of the species.
45
46 Apart from Mesotaria ambigua, Koretsky and Ray [4] also considered
47
48 Paleophoca nystii Van Beneden, 1876 (and alternative spellings, including

3 Van Beneden, 1876) a junior synonym to Callophoca obscura. Many of the
4
5 postcranial specimens that have formerly been assigned to P. nystii are
6
7 notably similar to the postcranial bones of C. obscura. However, the holotype
8
9 of P. nystii is an isolated tooth [4, 37] that has later been reassigned to the
10
11
odontocete cetacean Scaldicetus grandis (Du Bus, 1872) [4]. Therefore, P.
12
13
14 nystii should be considered a junior synonym of S. grandis, and, hence, P.
15
16 nystii technically cannot be considered a synonym to C. obscura.
17
18 Considering the material from the east coast of North America, most of the
19
20 humeri which have been assigned to Pliophoca etrusca by Koretsky and Ray
21
22 [4] seem to belong to Callophoca obscura.

25
26
27 Description and comparison
28
29 Humerus (Figures 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B). Because the lectotype of
30
31 Callophoca obscura is an isolated partial humerus (IRSNB 1198-M203), other humeri
32
33 are the only bones that can unambiguously be compared and assigned to
34
35 Callophoca obscura. Four isolated humeri from Belgium and a few tens of specimens
36
37
from the east coast of North America can be assigned to the taxon. The humeral
38
39
40 head is slightly compressed proximodistally, as stated by Koretsky and Ray [4], and
41
42 the head faces proximoposteriorly, while it projects more posteriorly in Pliophoca
43
44 etrusca. The humeral neck is poorly-developed in C. obscura, while it is much more
45
46 prominent in the holotype of P. etrusca and strongly overhangs the diaphysis
47
48 posteriorly. The lesser tubercle reaches proximal to the level of the humeral head.
49
50
This strongly resembles extant Phocidae (except Monachus) which all have a
51
52
53
strongly developed lesser tubercle, reaching higher than the level of the humeral
54
55 head, while other late Neogene Monachinae (e.g., Acrophoca longirostris,

Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 22 of 76

2
3 Homiphoca capensis, Piscophoca pacifica, and Pl. etrusca) all tend to have a lesser
4
5 tubercle that approximately reaches the same level as the humeral head, or distal to
6
7 it [e.g., 9, 21, 38]. The greater tubercle is also well-developed, reaching the proximal
8
9 level of the humeral head. A similar condition has been observed in the Neogene
10
11
Monachinae Ac. longirostris, Auroraphoca atlantica (newly described taxon in this
12
13
14 study), H. capensis, and Pi. pacifica, in which the greater tubercle reaches the same
15
16 proximal level as the humeral head, or exceeds it. This contrasts with other
17
18 Monachinae in which the greater tubercle does not reach the proximal level of the
19
20 humeral head.
21
22 The deltopectoral crest is poorly preserved in the lectotype humerus IRSNB 1198-
23
24
M203 of Callophoca obscura, but it is preserved in North American specimens. It is
25
26
27 separated from the lesser tubercle by a wide and deep intertubercular groove. In the
28
29 intertubercular groove, a distinct transverse bicipital bar is present, as in most
30
31 Monachinae, except the extant Hydrurga leptonyx, Leptonychotes weddelli and the
32
33 extinct Acrophoca longirostris, Homiphoca sp., and the newly-described
34
35 Virginiaphoca magurai. As in other Monachinae, the deltopectoral crest of C. obscura
36
37
is rounded and distally terminates smoothly just proximal to the coronoid fossa. In
38
39
40 lateral view, the deltopectoral crest is widest proximally. The deltoid tuberosity is
41
42 strongly pronounced on the lateral side of the deltopectoral crest and located just
43
44 proximal to the middle of the bone. In anterior view, the deltopectoral crest is slightly
45
46 curving laterally and slightly offset laterally, as in Homiphoca, while it is straight in
47
48 Pliophoca etrusca. In lateral view, the deltopectoral crest of C. obscura is uniquely
49
50
broad yet subtriangular; and diaphysis has only a minor curvature. Extant
51
52
53
Monachinae all have a diaphysis with strong curvature, while many extinct
54
55 Monachinae retain a straighter diaphysis, such as Acrophoca longirostris,

3 Piscophoca pacifica, and Pl. etrusca. Yet, a number of extinct Monachinae, including
4
5 Homiphoca and Properiptychus argentinus have a rather strongly curving diaphysis.
6
7 At the distal extremity of the humerus of Callophoca obscura, the coronoid fossa on
8
9 the anterior side is weakly developed, as is the olecranon fossa on the posterior side.
10
11
The supinator crest on the lateral epicondyle is only little developed, which is a
12
13
14 typical monachine trait. The medial epicondyle is better developed and appears as a
15
16 rounded obtuse triangle in anterior view. C. obscura lacks an entepicondylar
17
18 foramen, similar to all other Monachinae, except Homiphoca and Virginiaphoca
19
20 magurai nov. gen. et nov. sp. At the trochlear notch, the anterior margin of the radial
21
22 head strongly slopes distolaterally, as in Homiphoca. In Pliophoca etrusca, this
23
24
margin is more proximally convex.

3 anteriorly. As in Monachus, but unlike Lobodontini, the premaxillae terminate
4
5 agains the nasals, where they are anteroposteriorly elongated. The
6
7 premaxillae have prominent tuberosities anteriorly. The ascending process of
8
9 the maxilla is relatively high as in Lobodontini and, viewed anteriorly, is not
10
11
strongly recurved medially as in Monachus. Dental formula: 2.1.4.1/2.1.4.1.
12
13
14 The premolars are morphologically similar to those of Monachus and unlike
15
16 those of Lobodontini. They differ from those of Monachus in being lower
17
18 crowned, relatively narrow and in having a pronounced posterolingual
19
20 expansion of the cingulum. The accessory cusps on the premolars are small
21
22 but distinct, while the M1 usually lacks such cusps and is distinct in having a
23
24
strongly recurved and sharp, pointed principal cusp. The M1 is the largest of
25
26
27 the cheek teeth, with the principal cusp slanted posteriorly, and often with a
28
29 small accessory cusp low on the long anterior keel of the principal cusp. The
30
31 interorbital region is broad and tapers posteriorly as in Lobodon, but unlike all
32
33 other monachines. In the auditory region the tympanic bulla covers the
34
35 petrosal, while the mastoid forms a lip overlapping the posterior border of the
36
37
bulla.”

3 Comments. Recent research of the Homiphoca material of the ‘E’ Quarry by
4
5 Govender et al. [22] and Govender [23] showed the existence of at least two
6
7 different morphotypes of Homiphoca in the fossil record. Govender et al. [22]
8
9 presented the presence of two morphotypes of the skull, scapula humerus,
10
11
radius, ulna, innominate, femur, and tibia and fibula; with morphological
12
13
14 variation apparently exceeding that of intraspecific variation based on
15
16 extrapolation of extant Monachinae. Later, Govender [23] performed a detailed
17
18 analysis of the known skulls of Homiphoca, confirming the presence of two
19
20 (and possibly three) different morphotypes of Homiphoca skulls.
21
22 Moreover, there is considerable disagreement on the possible existence of a
23
24
yet-undescribed species of Homiphoca. Some researchers suggest that the
25
26
27 observed morphological differences between the different morphotypes
28
29 exceeds intraspecific variation [22, 23], while others rather invoke profound
30
31 sexual dimorphism and consider it unlikely for multiple closely-related species
32
33 to occupy the same ecological niche in the same environment and at the same
34
35 time (Christian de Muizon, pers. comm., 2017; LD, pers. obs., 2017). Because
36
37
the fossil record of Homiphoca consists of isolated specimens, it is impossible
38
39
40 to relate the holotype skull to any of the isolated postcranial specimens, or to
41
42 compare the different isolated postcranial bones reciprocally. Therefore, it is
43
44 impossible to ascertain the correlation between the different morphotypes to
45
46 different types of bones. Consequently, we deem it appropriate to consider the
47
48 entire fossil record of Homiphoca with extreme care and only consider the
49
50
holotype skull SAM-PQ-L15695 to belong to Homiphoca capensis
51
52
53
unquestionably. Following the reasoning for Callophoca obscura, all
54
55 postcranial specimens of H. capensis should be considered as indeterminate

58

2
3 monachine. However, the stratigraphy of Homiphoca from South Africa differs
4
5 from C. obscura from the North Atlantic. Virtually all cranial and postcranial
6
7 specimens attributed to H. capensis come from the LQSM and MPPM levels of
8
9 the Varswater Formation in South America [20–22, 28]. These levels have a
10
11
very limited temporal range, and are virtually bonebeds. Hence, it can be
12
13
14 argued as to what extent multiple closely-relate taxa can occupy the same
15
16 ecological niche in the same area and at the same time. Furthermore, the high
17
18 number of specimens found at Langebaanweg, the only-known South African
19
20 locality of Homiphoca renders it very likely that at least one of both
21
22 morphotypes of humeri belongs to H. capensis. Therefore, it is safe to assume
23
24
that all isolated seal specimens, which can be grouped into two morphotypes,
25
26
27 may actually represent one sexually dimorph taxon. But, pending the
28
29 discovery of more complete articulated skeletons of Homiphoca capensis, we
30
31 deem it most appropriate to consider specimens Homiphoca sp., rather than
32
33 Homiphoca capensis or Monachinae indet. The stratigraphic range of C.
34
35 obscura, on the other hand, is completely different in that the stratigraphic
36
37
range of C. obscura from Belgium is poorly delineated and that the Yorktown
38
39
40 Formation in North America had been deposited over a longer time span with
41
42 [27, 39] with no clear fossiliferous horizon and most fossils recovered from
43
44 spoil piles with no detailed stratigraphic context other than the formation [40].
45
46 The “H. capensis” specimens of the Lee Creek Mine in North Carolina should
47
48 conservatively be considered Homiphoca sp. as well (contra Koretsky and Ray
49
50
[4]). A reassessment of the Homiphoca humeri from Koretsky and Ray [4] is
51
52
53

19
20 Comments. The holotype specimen of Homiphoca capensis, the sole species
21
22 currently defined in the genus Homiphoca, is a partial skull that has been
23
24
found isolated [20, 21]. Recent research by Govender et al. [22] and Govender
25
26
27 [23] showed that virtually all cranial and postcranial specimens attributed to H.
28
29 capensis have been found isolated and that at least two different morphotypes
30
31 exist, hypothesizing the presence of at least a second species of Homiphoca.
32
33 However, the presence of two closely-related taxa in the same locality and
34
35 occupying the same ecological niche is questionable, as noted above.

40 Description and comparison.
41
42 Humerus (Figures 2C, 2D, 3C, 3D, 4C, 4D, 5C, 5D). Koretsky and Ray [4] assigned
43
44 two humeri from the Yorktown Formation at the Lee Creek Mine to Homiphoca
45
46 capensis: USNM 187228, and USNM 214550. However, the whereabouts of the
47
48 latter specimen are unknown and the current study only focuses on specimen USNM
49
50
187228. The humeral head of Homiphoca specimen USNM 187228 from the east
51
52
53
coast of North America faces proximoposteriorly, similar to Callophoca obscura, and
54
55 Homiphoca from South Africa (Fig. X). The neck is well developed and it is

3 morphologically similar to that of Homiphoca from South Africa, but unlike that of
4
5 Callophoca obscura in which it is less developed, or Pliophoca etrusca in which it is
6
7 also well developed but more strongly overhanging the diaphysis (Fig. X). The lesser
8
9 tubercle of Homiphoca from North America reaches the proximal level of the humeral
10
11
head, as in C. obscura, Homiphoca from South Africa, and the Virginiaphoca magurai
12
13
14 nov. gen. et nov. sp. (see below) from the Nottoway River, but unlike P. etrusca and
15
16 Auroraphoca atlantica nov. gen. et nov. sp. (see below) previously considered P.
17
18 etrusca from North America, which has a lesser tubercle that exceeds the level of the
19
20 humeral head. A reduced lesser tubercle is considered a plesiomorphic trait among
21
22 pinnipeds [38, 41]. The lesser tubercle diverts strongly off the diaphysis. The greater
23
24
tubercle does not reach the proximal level of the humeral head, which is considered
25
26
27 a derived character in Phocidae, but appears to be present in all extant Phocidae and
28
29 only some extinct Phocidae (see, e.g., Dewaele et al. [8, 18]).
30
31 The deltopectoral crest is moderately well preserved in USNM 187228. It is
32
33 separated from the lesser tubercle by a wide intertubercular groove. In the
34
35 intertubercular groove, there is no transverse bicipital bar present. As mentioned
36
37
above, such a bicipital bar is present in most Monachinae, except the extant
38
39
40 Hydrurga leptonyx, Leptonychotes weddelli and the extinct Acrophoca longirostris,
41
42 Homiphoca sp. from South Africa, and Virginiaphoca magurai. The deltopectoral
43
44 crest of USNM 187228 is rounded and terminates distally proximal to the coronoid
45
46 fossa. On the lateral side of the deltopectoral crest, the deltoid tuberosity overhangs
47
48 the diaphysis, along the entire length of the tuberosity. This condition varies among
49
50
Neogene Monachinae from the North Atlantic. In anterior view, the deltopectoral crest
51
52
53
is slightly curving laterally and slightly offset laterally, as in Callophoca obscura, and
54
55 Homiphoca from South Africa, while it is straight in Pliophoca etrusca (Fig. X). In

Page 29 of 76 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
29
1
2
3 lateral view, the diaphysis has a strong curvature, as in Homiphoca from South Africa
4
5 and extant Monachinae. Many other extinct Monachinae retain a straighter diaphysis,
6
7 such as Acrophoca longirostris, C. obscura, Piscophoca pacifica, and Pl. etrusca [9,
8
9 38].
10
11
At the distal extremity of the humerus of USNM 187228, the coronoid fossa on the
12
13
14 anterior side is weakly developed, as is the olecranon fossa on the posterior side.
15
16 The supinator crest on the lateral epicondyle is better developed than in other
17
18 Monachinae, except Homiphoca from South Africa, and hence, better developed than
19
20 in Callophoca obscura, and Pliophoca etrusca. The medial epicondyle bears an
21
22 entepicondylar foramen, which is a symplesiomorphic trait shared with Phocinae and
23
24
other Pinnipedia, except Monachinae. Among Monachinae, the presence of an
25
26
27 entepicondylar foramen is unique to Homiphoca and Virginiaphoca magurai nov. gen.
28
29 et nov. sp. (USNM 639750, see below). Monotherium also has an entepicondylar
30
31 foramen and has been considered a monachine [9, 12, 38], but the humeri of
32
33 Monotherium aberratum and Monotherium affine are considered to be phocine in a
34
35 recent study by Dewaele et al. (in review). Overall morphology and the description of
36
37
the Homiphoca specimens from the Lee Creek Mine, show noticeable similarities
38
39
40 with the Homiphoca humeri from South Africa. The study of Govender et al. [22]
41
42 shows relatively little difference between the two humerus morphotypes of
43
44 Homiphoca from South Africa. Two most prominent differences observed are the
45
46 degree of development and curvature of the deltopectoral crest, and the shape of the
47
48 deltoid tuberosity. The deltoid tuberosity is very incompletely preserved in specimen
49
50
USNM 187228. The shape of the deltopectoral of USNM 187228 corresponds to that
51
52
53
of morphotype I from South Africa, in which the deltopectoral crest ‘does not follow
54
55 the curve of the bone’ [22:142]. Overall, the humerus USNM 187228 is strongly

3 similar to that of morphotype I of Homiphoca from South Africa, and differences are
4

6
7 Yorktown Formation of the east coast of North America.

33 Pliophoca etrusca. Consequently, we do not emend the diagnosis presented
34
35 by Berta et al. [9], apart from the exclusion of Leptophoca from the list of stem
36
37
monachines, following recent recent phylogenetic analysis of the taxon by
38
39
40 Dewaele et al. [8, 18]: “Pliophoca is distinguished from Monachus by medial
41
42 tuberosity on premaxillary reduced or absent, lateral extension on premaxillary
43
44 present, upper incisors transversely compressed, femur epiphyses in which
45

28
29 Comments. The holotype specimen MSNUP I-13993 is the only known specimen
30
31 that can be attributed to the species Pliophoca etrusca [9]. However, this
32
33 holotype is relatively complete, making it one of the most completely-known
34
35 phocid fossils. Originally, Tavani [40] assigned additional material to the
36
37
species. However, Berta et al. [9:e889144-16] approached the material more
38
39
40 conservatively and only retained the holotype specimen as P. etrusca, arguing
41
42 about the additional specimens that “most of it is from a different locality than
43
44 the holotype and it consists, in part, of some noncomparable elements to the
45
46 holotype (e.g., mandible), we feel that it is more appropriately referred to
47
48 Pliophoca cf. P. etrusca.” In the current study, we encourage a more
49
50
conservative approach in phocid paleontology, advocating against the
51
52
53
widespread practice of assigning isolated incomparable specimens to one or
54
55 another taxon. Therefore, we support Berta et al. [9] in considering that it is not

3 appropriate to consider the very partial specimens from the Museo di Geologia
4
5 e Paleontologia in Florence as P. etrusca. In their review of Pliocene Phocidae
6
7 from the east coast of North America, Koretsky and Ray [4] considered a large
8
9 number of fossil seal specimens of the Lee Creek Mine. However, these
10
11
specimens show little similarities with the holotype from Italy, and are all
12
13
14 reassigned to other taxa (see below; XXX) or as indeterminate Monachinae.
15
16 This has also been postulated by Berta et al. [9], considering Koretsky and
17
18 Ray’s [8] allegedly North American specimens of P. etrusca as ‘Pliophoca aff.

5 Diagnosis. Auroraphoca atlantica is a medium-sized phocid, comparable in size to
6
7 the extant Lobodon carcinophaga (crabeater seal), different from other extant
8
9 and other extinct Monachinae by the abrupt distal termination of the
10
11
deltopectoral crest, and the presence of a reduced and distally-located
12
13
14 epicondylar crest. It differs from all extinct Monachinae (except Callophoca
15
16 obscura) by the strong development of the lesser tubercle, exceeding the
17
18 proximal level of the humeral head.
19
20 Etymology. The specific name ‘atlantica’ refers to the Atlantic Ocean. The holotype
21
22 specimen of Auroraphoca atlantica was recovered from the Yorktown

Formation, deposited at the east coast of North America during the Pliocene.

4
5 Of this bone, from specimen USNM 250290, only the proximal portion is preserved,
6
7 but its identification as A. atlantica is based on its articulation with a humerus that can
8
9 be identified as A. atlantica. The specimen is not described here because it is too

16 Humerus (Figures 2F, 3F, 4F, 5F)—Humeri USNM 181419 and USNM 250290
17
18 differ morphologically from both Callophoca obscura and Pliophoca etrusca, although
19
20 Koretsky and Ray [4] formerly assigned both specimens to P. etrusca. Humerus
21
22 USNM 181419 is nearly complete, missing only the anteroproximal portion of the
23
24
deltopectoral crest. Humerus USNM 250290 is associated with a partial scapula and
25
26
27 an ulna. This specimen is only partially preserved and is clearly not skeletally adult,
28
29 as can be judged from the clearly visible suture between the proximal epiphysis and
30
31 the diaphysis. The humerus of Auroraphoca atlantica is overall relatively slender
32
33 compared to other contemporaneous monachine humeri. The humeral head is
34
35 rounded, hemispherical, and much smaller than in the holotype humerus of Pl.
36
37
etrusca. The humeral head appears negligibly smaller than in other
38
39
40 contemporaneous Monachinae from the North Atlantic and Homiphoca from South
41

43
44 tubercle reaches proximal to both the humeral head and the greater trochanter.
45
46 Among Monachinae, and Phocinae in general, the development of the lesser and
47
48 great tubercles of the humerus show evolutionary trends [8, 18, 38]. Among
49
50
Phocidae, the development of the greater and lesser trochanter shows opposite
51
52
53
evolutionary trends, with the greater trochanter usually being well-developed in
54
55 extant Phocidae (except Monachus monachus), and less well developed in extinct

3 Phocidae (except C. obscura and P. etrusca) [8, 18; this study]. Dewaele et al. [8, 18]
4
5 and Muizon [38] noted the reverse for the development of the lesser tubercle of the
6
7 humerus in Phocidae. The strong development of the lesser tubercle in the humerus
8
9 of A. atlantica corresponds more with extant Phocidae and C. obscura and Pl.
10
11
etrusca than with most extinct Phocidae. A broad bicipital groove separates the
12
13
14 lesser tubercle from the greater tubercle and the deltopectoral crest. In the
15
16 intertubercular groove, there is a transverse bicipital bar. The deltopectoral crest
17
18 extends for almost two-thirds along the anterior side of the diaphysis, terminating
19
20 rather abruptly, distally. This abrupt distal termination separates the humerus of Au.
21
22 atlantica from the humeri of extant and other extinct Monachinae, which all have a
23
24
smooth and more gradual distal termination. The deltoid tuberosity extends along the
25
26
27 proximal two-thirds of the lateral side of the deltopectoral crest. This tuberosity
28
29 overhangs the diaphysis laterally in two distinct places, anteriorly and posteriorly.
30
31 This condition varies among different taxa of Monachinae from the Neogene of the
32
33 North Atlantic. A similar condition to Au. atlantica is observed only in the newly-
34
35 described humerus USNM 639750 from V. magurai (see below). In anterior view, the
36
37
deltopectoral crest of humerus USNM 181419 is slightly convex laterally, and the
38
39
40 crest terminates above the coronoid process. The diaphysis of the humerus of Au.
41
42 atlantica is slender compared to the humerus of other Monachinae from the Neogene
43
44 of the North Atlantic. Proximally on the posterior surface of the diaphysis of the
45
46 humerus there is a deep fossa serving as the attachment surface for the triceps
47
48 brachii muscle. Among phocids, a similar condition has only been observed in
49
50
Monotherium aberratum, Monotherium affine, and Piscophoca pacifica [38; LD, pers.

3 In anterior view, the distal epiphysis of USNM 181419 is equally wide as the proximal
4
5 epiphysis. This character is shared with Homiphoca and with the newly-described
6
7 humerus from the Nottoway River (see below). In C. obscura and Pliophoca etrusca,
8
9 the proximal epiphysis is broader than the distal epiphysis. The medial epicondyle
10
11
strongly reaches distally. The epicondylar crest is very short and relatively strongly
12
13
14 extruding, compared to the condition in other Monachinae, resulting in a strongly
15
16 reduced attachment surface for multiple manual extensor muscles. There is no
17
18 entepicondylar foramen, a synapomorphy among Monachinae. Among Phocidae,
19
20 only the extinct Homiphoca and Phocinae an entepicondylar foramen [43, 44].
21
22 Correlated, the weak development of the epicondylar crest yields an apparently
23
24
straighter humerus in lateral view than it does in Homiphoca or V. magurai (newly
25
26
27 described below) from the Nottoway River, but not as straight as in C. obscura or Pl.
28
29 etrusca. The olecranon and coronoid fossae are strongly reduced, and the trochlea is
30
31 small. The medial ulnar lip of the trochlea is well-developed, forming a sharp ridge,
32
33 as in Pl. etrusca and V. magurai, but unlike C. obscura and Homiphoca.

Ulna (Figures 6A–C)—Contrasting to other types of bone, Koretsky and Ray [4]
38
39
40 assigned only one ulna from North America to Pliophoca etrusca: USNM 250290,
41
42 which is associated with a scapula and a humerus. Although the proximal epiphysis
43
44 of the specimen is fused to the diaphysis, the absence of the distal epiphysis argues
45
46 that this specimen belonged to a skeletally subadult seal [45], as had been argued by
47
48 Koretsky and Ray [4]. Although incomplete, the total length of ulna USNM 250290
49
50
falls nears the estimated total length of 170 mm for the ulna of Homiphoca [20].
51
52
53
USNM 250290 is only slightly longer than the holotype ulna MSNUP I-13993 of P.
54
55 etrusca, and the holotype MNHN.F.ORN1 of Messiphoca mauretanica, but still within

4
5 preservation of the olecranon process in both USNM 250290 and P. etrusca
6
7 specimen MSNUP I-13993 limits comparative description of the process. However, it
8
9 appears that the olecranon process in USNM 250290 is more strongly sloping than in
10
11
Homiphoca and P. etrusca. The proximal portion of the ulna of M. mauretanica is
12
13
14 also strongly sloping, with a strongly concave proximal margin of the olecranon
15
16 process [16]. The anconeal process on the medial side of the proximal portion of the
17
18 olecranon process is weakly-developed, as in P. etrusca. This condition had been
19
20 considered a monachine trait by [20] (except Piscophoca pacifica). The sigmoid
21
22 notch is strongly concave, contrasting to Homiphoca, M. mauretanica, and P.
23
24
etrusca. Partly related to this strong curvature of the sigmoid notch in lateral view, the
25
26
27 coronoid process of USNM 250290 is more strongly pronounced than in Homiphoca,
28
29 and P. etrusca. The greater sigmoid cavity is saddle-shaped and simple (reversed)
30
31 tear-drop shaped in USNM 250290, while it is much more sigmoidal in the P. etrusca
32
33 holotype MSNUP I-13993, in which the distal extremity of this cavity strongly deflects
34
35 medially; and the lesser sigmoid cavity is circular and flat, while it is slightly concave
36
37
in P. etrusca. Overall, the sigmoid notch of ulna USNM 250290 resembles that of M.
38
39
40 mauretanica. However, comparison involved illustrations of M. mauretanica and no
41
42 direct observations. Moreover, the limited diagnostic value of ulna for Phocidae
43
44 precludes comparing USNM 250290 with M. mauretanica.
45
46 The diaphysis of the ulna USNM 250290 is robust and strongly curving. In lateral
47
48 view, the diaphysis is thicker than in Homiphoca, M. mauretanica, and P. etrusca. In
49
50
anterior view, the diaphysis is approximately equal to the proximal portion of the
51
52
53
coronoid process, in USNM 250290 and Homiphoca, while the proximal portion of the
54
55 coronoid process is wider than the diaphysis in P. etrusca, and while the diaphysis is

2
3 The humeral head is hemispherical and slightly compressed proximodistally. The
4
5 degree of proximodistal compression is higher than in other monachine humeri from
6
7 the Neogene of the North Atlantic. The neck is strongly reduced, compared to other
8
9 Monachinae from the North Atlantic, giving the entire humerus a moderately straight
10
11
appearance in lateral view: straighter than in Homiphoca sp. from North America and
12
13
14 South Africa, similarly straight as humerus USNM 181419 of Auroraphoca atlantica,
15
16 but not as straight as in Callophoca obscura or Pliophoca etrusca. Extant Phocidae
17
18 and other extinct Phocidae all have a relatively more curved humeral diaphysis in
19
20 lateral view. The lesser tubercle almost reaches the same proximal level as the head
21
22 and does not divert strongly medially from the axis of the humerus. In living
23
24
monachines, except the monk seals of the genus Monachus, the lesser tubercle is
25
26
27 strongly developed and exceeds the level of the humeral head. This condition varies
28
29 among extinct Monachinae, with, e.g., C. obscura, Homiphoca sp. and Pl. etrusca
30
31 having a well-developed lesser tubercle, while Acrophoca longirostris, Piscophoca
32
33 pacifica, and Properiptychus argentinus from South America all have a relatively
34
35 small lesser tubercle [38, 46; this study]. The bicipital groove is moderately deep and
36
37
wide. In the intertubercular groove, there is no transverse bicipital bar. The greater
38
39
40 tubercle reaches slightly lower than the humeral head, as in extant Phocidae [38].
41
42 However, a number extinct monachine taxa have a greater tubercle that exceeds the
43
44 level of the humeral head, including C. obscura and Homiphoca sp. (this study). The
45
46 deltopectoral crest is long, approximately 2/3 the length of the entire bone and
47
48 reaching the level of the proximal portion of the medial epicondyle. In lateral view, the
49
50
humerus USNM 639750 of V. magurai is semicircular. This condition is roughly
51
52
53
intermediate between the less expanded deltopectoral crest of Acrophoca
54
55 longirostris, morphotype II in Homiphoca, Pl. etrusca, and Pr. argentinus; and the

3 deltopectoral crest of C. obscura, morpotype I of Homiphoca, and Piscophoca
4
5 pacifica. The deltoid rugosity on the lateral surface of the deltopectoral crest is
6
7 proximodistally elongated, widest proximally and tapering distally, and slightly
8
9 overhanging the lateral surface of the deltopectoral crest in two separate places. The
10
11
latter condition is observed in the humerus of Au. atlantica, but otherwise this varies
12
13
14 among extinct Monachinae. In anterior view, the deltopectoral crest of V. magurai
15
16 does not deflect as much laterally as it does in other Neogene Monachinae from the
17
18 North Atlantic, except Pl. etrusca, and largely remains within the anteroposterior
19
20 plane through the axis of the humerus. Among Monachinae, the presence of an
21
22 entepicondylar foramen is a feature unique for the genus Homiphoca [20, 21, 38]. An
23
24
entepicondylar foramen is also known to exist in Monotherium. However, a study
25
26
27 contesting Monotherium as a monachine genus is in review. However, it is also
28
29 present in USNM 639750. The distal portion of the humerus of V. magurai does not
30
31 differ significantly from that of Homiphoca, with a broad and little-developed medial
32
33 epicondyle. The epicondylar crest is little developed, as is common in all
34
35 Monachinae, except Homiphoca. As Berta et al. [9] observed in Pliophoca etrusca, V.
36
37
magurai has a narrow but well-marked attachment surface for the m. extensor carpi
38
39
40 radialis on the posterolateral margin of the epicondylar crest. This attachment surface
41
42 appears less strongly developed in C. obscura and Homiphoca. The coronoid fossa
43
44 is rather shallow and the roughly oval olecranon fossa is moderately deep. The
45
46 shared presence of an entepicondylar foramen in V. magurai and Homiphoca sp. and
47
48 the absence of a transverse bicipital bar in the intertubercular groove may suggest a
49
50
phylogenetic relationship between both taxa. However, the incompleteness of the
51
52
53
fossil record of V. magurai inhibits a detailed phylogenetic analysis.

3 Comments. Fossil phocid specimens that Koretsky and Ray [4] assigned to
4
5 Pliophoca etrusca from North America are reconsidered in this study (see
6
7 below). Our reassessment shows that some specimens are incomparable to
8
9 the holotype (and currently only definitely known) specimen of P. etrusca, such
10
11
as is the case for mandibles and the mandibular dentition [4 versus 9].
12
13
14 Specimens from the Neogene of North America that are comparable to the
15
16 Italian holotype of P. etrusca show noticeable differences with the holotype,
17
18 despite the designation by Koretsky and Ray [4] (see below). Consequently,
19
20 given the overall incompleteness of the fossil record of Monachinae from the
21
22 North Atlantic, most of these redescribed specimens are to be considered
23
24
Monachinae indet.
25
26
27 In the current study, we argue to only consider subcomplete or complete
28
29 humeri for the designation of new monachine taxa, in the absence of more
30
31 complete and articulated specimens. Indeed, the Auroraphoca atlantica
32
33 humerus USNM 250290 is articulated with a partial scapula and an ulna.
34
35 However, the specimen is clearly juvenile, which we deem inappropriate for
36
37
holotype designation.

47

49
50
Pliophoca etrusca. For the original material of P. etrusca from Italy, i.e., the holotype,
51
52
53
no mandibles or mandibular teeth are known [9]. In the absence of articulated
54
55 specimens having both mandibles and mandibular teeth as well as bones that are

59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 44 of 76
44

2
3 comparable to the holotype specimen, it remains impossible to assign isolated
4
5 mandibles and mandibular teeth to the taxon. The maxilla, on the other hand, is
6
7 known from the holotype of Pliophoca etrusca and can be compared to specimens
8
9 from North America; although they are very incomplete.
10
11
The state of preservation of the referred and illustrated specimens from North
12
13
14 America inhibits a detailed description. The postcanine tooth row is seated on a
15
16 lowly-raised alveolar process. The postcanine tooth row is slightly diverging
17
18 posteriorly, as in Homiphoca. However, the incomplete state of preservation of the
19
20 holotype skull of Pliophoca etrusca from Italy inhibits comparison between the
21
22 referred specimens and the P. etrusca holotype. The alveoli for the maxillary teeth in
23
24
specimen USNM 205397 show that P1 is single-rooted, while the other postcanine
25
26
27 teeth are double-rooted. Spacing between the alveolus of P1 and C and P2 are
28
29 difficult to assess. Given the absence of complete teeth, it is impossible to ascertain
30
31 whether the spacing can be considered a diastema or just spacing to accommodate
32
33 the tooth crowns.
34
35 On the ventral surface of maxilla USNM 205397, on the palatal process of the
36
37
maxilla, there is a broad and shallow groove parallel and close to the tooth row.
38
39
40 Posteriorly, this groove terminates into the anterior palatal foramen, located at the
41
42 level between P4 and M1. This condition strongly differs from Homiphoca (narrow,
43
44 deep groove and termination posterior to the anterior alveolus of M1) and from the
45
46 holotype of P. etrusca (shallow groove terminating anterior at the level of the
47
48 posterior alveolus of P3)
49
50
Consequently, although the maxillae are very incomplete, both for the referred
51
52
53
specimens from North America and the holotype of Pliophoca etrusca, there are a
54
55 few differences that set both operational taxonomic units (OTUs) apart from each

of North America to the species Pliophoca etrusca. One subadult specimen, USNM
12
13
14 250290 has been found associated with a scapula, a humerus, and an ulna [4] (see
15
16 above). However, the radii Koretsky and Ray [4] assigned to P. etrusca show marked
17
18 differences with the P. etrusca holotype radius MSNUP I-13993.
19
20 Overall, the radii from North America Koretsky and Ray [4] assigned to Pliophoca
21
22 etrusca are slender and elongate, with smooth distal expansion of the diaphysis. This
23
24
condition has also been observed in the holotype radius of P. etrusca, as well as in
25
26
27 the morphotype II radius of Homiphoca (see Govender et al. [22]). For morphotype I,
28
29 Govender et al. [22:142] argue that “the shaft of morphotype I is fairly short and wide
30
31 with the distal expansion beginning higher on the shaft.” I.e., the distal expansion of
32
33 the diaphysis of morphotype I is more pronounced in morphotype I of Homiphoca.
34
35 Also, the holotype radius of Messiphoca mauretanica, MNHN.F.ORN1, has a short
36
37
diaphysis that widens very strongly, distally. In lateral view, the curvature of the radii
38
39
40 is moderate, intermediate to weakly-curved radius of Homiphoca and the more
41
42 strongly curved radius of P. etrusca. On the proximal epiphysis, the radii which
43
44 Koretsky and Ray [4] assigned to P. etrusca bear a well-marked articular facet for the
45
46 ulna, with a strongly-developed distal lip on the posterior margin. This condition has
47
48 also been observed in Homiphoca and P. etrusca, and only to a lesser extent in M.
49
50
mauretanica. The bicipital tuberosity is subcircular and lowly-raised, contrasting to
51
52
53
Homiphoca and P. etrusca in which it is rather ovoid and well-raised (see Berta et al.
54
55 [9]). The bicipital tuberosity is separated from the proximal epiphysis and the position

2
3 on the diaphysis varies, being located either medially (USNM 307537) or
4
5 posteriomedially (USNM 181504) on the diaphysis. Among other Phocidae, all extinct
6
7 Monachinae, including Homiphoca, and P. etrusca have a medially located bicipital
8
9 tuberosity, and extant Monachinae have a posteromedially located bicipital tuberosity
10
11
[9, 40]. On the diaphysis, the considered radii bear a weak rugosity approximately
12
13
14 halfway the posterior margin. This is the insertion area for the radius-ulna ligament
15
16 and is similarly developed in Homiphoca, but very prominent in P. etrusca. On the
17
18 anterior margin of the diaphysis, the insertion area for the pronator teres muscle is
19
20 weakly developed, while the insertion areas for the supinator and brachioradialis
21
22 muscles are smooth, i.e., well developed. This corresponds with observations in
23
24
extant Phocinae, but contrasts with both extant and extinct Monachinae, except
25
26
27 Monachus monachus and Piscophoca pacifica. In lateral view, the distal portion of
28
29 the diaphysis is relatively smooth, as in extant Monachine, while it possesses
30
31 relatively well-developed grooves for manual tendons in other extinct Monachinae,
32
33 including Homiphoca and P. etrusca. The scapholunar facet on the distal extremity of
34
35 the radius is concavoconvex, as in other Phocidae.
36
37
The referred radii of Koretsky and Ray [4] share a number of characteristics with
38
39
40 Pliophoca etrusca, and Monachinae in general. However, it should be clear that there
41
42 is a plethora of differences between the referred humeri and the holotype radius
43
44 MSNUP I-13993 of P. etrusca. Consequently, it is highly doubtful that the referred
45
46 radii from North America can be assigned to P. etrusca, but that they should rather
47
48 be considered as Monachinae indet.

Femur (Figures 9A–C)—Koretsky and Ray [4] assigned seventeen femora from the

47
1
2
3 includes an apparently associated humerus and femur. All other femora from North
4
5 America that have formerly been assigned to P. etrusca constitute isolated
6
7 specimens. Although the holotype femur of P. etrusca, MSNUP I-13993, is only
8
9 partially preserved, it is clearly distinct from the “P. etrusca” femora described by
10
11
Koretsky and Ray [4]. Both adult (Figures 9A-C) and juvenile (Figure 9D) specimens
12
13
14 from North America have been considered, judging by the degree of epiphyseal
15
16 fusion [45]. It can also be noted that there are noticeable differences among the
17
18 different specimens that Koretsky and Ray [4] consider for P. etrusca: e.g., the
19
20 greater trochanter is much broader but lower in USNM 243686 (Figure 9A) than in
21
22 the other illustrated adult specimens (Figure 9B, 9C). Considering the absence of a
23
24
detailed quantitative study on the femora of Phocidae, it is yet unknown if the latter
25
26
27 variation can be considered intra or interspecific.
28
29 All femora are typically pinniped in that they are longitudinally short and transversely
30
31 broader than they are anteroposteriorly wide, resulting in a strongly elliptical
32
33 transverse cross section. In the considered specimens, the minimum diaphyseal
34
35 width of the shaft is in the proximal portion. Berta et al. [9] presented the same
36
37
condition for the holotype femur of Pliophoca etrusca. However, we disagree and
38
39
40 consider the minimum diaphyseal width of the shaft in both Homiphoca and P.
41
42 etrusca rather in the middle portion of the bone. In the specimens described by
43
44 Koretsky and Ray [4], the distal epiphysis is wider than the proximal epiphysis in
45
46 anterior and posterior view; similar to the condition in Homiphoca and P. etrusca.
47
48 Although the femoral head is not completely preserved, it is hemispherical, as in
49
50
Homiphoca and P. etrusca. On the contrasts, the neck does not appear as strongly
51
52
53
marked as in Homiphoca and the holotype of P. etrusca. The greater trochanter of
54
55 the specimen USNM 243686 is only lowly-raised and transversely broad, contrasting
56
57
58

Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 48 of 76
48
1
2
3 to the other illustrated specimens from North America, as well as the holotype of P.
4
5 etrusca, in which the greater trochanter is transversely less broad, but more highly-
6
7 raised. In all specimens from North America, the greater trochanter bears a
8
9 distinctive trochanteric fossa. While this trait is shared among all Phocinae, such a
10
11
trochanteric fossa is rarely present among Monachinae (including P. etrusca). Only
12
13
14 the extant Lobodon carcinophaga, and the extinct Homiphoca and Piscophoca
15
16 pacifica. The femora that have formerly been assigned to Callophoca obscura also
17
18 have a well-developed trochanteric fossa.
19
20 In anterior view, the diaphysis of the femur gradually widens distally into the distal
21
22 epiphysis. As a result, the distal portion of the femur attains a strongly triangular
23
24
appearance. This corresponds with the general condition among Monachinae (LD,
25
26
27 pers. obs., 2017). Dewaele et al. [8] also noted a strongly triangular distal part in the
28
29 femur of the phocine Prophoca rousseaui. Yet, generally, the distal portion of the
30
31 diaphysis widens abruptly in Phocinae. The distal portion of the holotype femur of P.
32
33 etrusca attains a rather phocine appearance. The epicondylar crest is lowly-raised
34
35 and robust, gradually merging into the diaphysis, proximally (distinct thin ridge in P.
36
37
etrusca). The lateral epicondyle is weakly-developed and smoothly tapers into the
38
39
40 diaphysis, proximally; while the lateral epicondyle is much more prominent in P.
41
42 etrusca, recurving proximally. The lateral condyle is large and rounded and the
43
44 medial condyle is correspondingly large. Both condyles are widely-spaced and
45
46 separated by a wide intercondylar groove. The patellar facet is wider than it is high,
47
48 as is widely observed among Monachinae [41].
49
50
Overall, the femora which Koretsky and Ray [4] identified as Pliophoca etrusca from
51
52
53
North America show little similarity with the holotype femur of P. etrusca.
54
55 Consequently, their designation as P. etrusca is contested. Nevertheless, since we
56
57
58
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 49 of 76 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
49
1
2
3 advocate for a more conservative approach to specimen designation in this study, we
4
5 reassign the femora from North America that have formerly been identified as P.
6
7 etrusca, to Monachinae indet. It should be noted that these femora are strongly
8
9 similar to each other and may belong to the same taxon, and that they superficially
10
11
resemble the femora that have formerly been assigned to Callophoca obscura.
12
13
14 However, as stated above, we limit the current fossil record of C. obscura to the
15
16 lectotype humerus and other humeri.

Discussion
24
25
26
27 The fossil record of all extinct Monachinae taxa that have been described from the
28
29 Neogene of the North Atlantic Ocean (including the Mediterranean Sea) has been
30
31 reassessed (Table 1). As shown from the descriptions of the different taxa and
32
33
specimens, monachine humeri are generally easily distinguishable and may be
34
35
36 considered as an acceptable basis for identifying different Monachinae. However, it
37
38 should be clear that this requires subcomplete or complete specimens. Hence, both
39
40 species of Terranectes are considered nomina dubia: the holotype of Terranectes
41
42 magnus is very incomplete humerus, and the holotype of Terranectes parvus is a
43
44 femur and cannot be compared to most other Monachinae from the North Atlantic
45
46
realm. In the absence of a more complete fossil record, i.e., with more complete and
47
48
49 articulated specimens, we strongly advocate the consistent use of at least
50
51 subcomplete or complete humeri (and associated or articulated bones) as type
52
53 specimens of fossil phocid taxa. A basic qualitative comparison of four humeri of
54
55 Hydrurga leptonyx and one humerus of of Leptonychotes weddellii suggests that
56
57
58
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 50 of 76
50
1
2
3 humeri are sufficiently diagnostic to distinguish taxa when complete (Figure 10).
4
5 However, the noticeable intraspecific variation observed, as well as the interspecific
6
7 similarities on some parts of the humerus support our assertion that incomplete
8
9 specimens are insufficiently diagnostic for species identification. A more detailed,
10
11
quantitative study of the inter- and intraspecific variation of Monachinae using
12
13
14 morphometric analysis would better resolve this issue, though such an effort is
15
16 beyond the scope of this study.
17
18
19
20 The situation with Messiphoca mauretanica is more complex: the holotype humerus
21
22 MNHN.F.ORN1 is only partially preserved; however, it is associated with an ulna, a
23
24
radius, and vertebrae. This entails a more complete type specimen than for many
25
26
27 other phocids, but ulnae, radii, and vertebrae are generally considered to have little
28
29 diagnostic value. Consequently, we consider it appropriate to consider M.
30
31 mauretanica a species inquirenda requiring further investigation regarding its validity.
32
33
34
35 Comparison of the fossil monachine fauna from the late Miocene and Pliocene of
36
37
Europe (east Atlantic) with that from the late Miocene and Pliocene of the east coast
38
39
40 of North America (west Atlantic) reveal strongly different biogeographic patterns than
41
42 have previously been proposed. Koretsky and Ray [4] suggested a strong connection
43
44 between both sides of the North Atlantic, considering the co-occurrence of
45
46 Callophoca obscura and Pliophoca etrusca on both sides. However, in light of our
47
48 taxonomic revision, this is called into question. The absence of Pliophoca in North
49
50
America, as well as the presence of two newly described taxa show that there was
51
52
53
little ‘interchange’ between monachine faunas on the east coast of North America
54
55 and the North Sea Basin (and South Atlantic, when including Homiphoca). Indeed,
56

58
59

Page 51 of 76 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
51
1
2
3 the presence of two new taxa from the late Miocene and early Pliocene, that are
4
5 currently not known from the east coast of the North Atlantic, suggest a certain
6
7 degree of endemism of the late Neogene North American monachine fauna.
8
9 However, the temporal differences between the late Miocene and Pliocene fossil
10
11
phocid-bearing strata from the North Sea basin, the east coast of North America, and
12
13
14 the Mediterranean, joined by the incomplete fossil record of both sides of the North
15
16 Atlantic, with many taxa known from exceedingly less specimens, precludes being
17
18 conclusive on the question of the paleodiversity of phocids in the North Atlantic
19
20 during the late Neogene.
21
22 The current fossil record shows that there was little faunal interchange between the
23
24
seal faunas from the east coast of North America and the North Sea Basin, with
25
26
27 Callophoca obscura being the only monachine seal recorded on both sites. The
28
29 faunal interchange between the east coast of North America and the North Sea Basin
30
31 with the Mediterranean during the late Miocene and Pliocene must have been
32
33 extremely limited; currently Pliophoca etrusca is the only known monachine seal from
34
35 the latest Neogene, i.e. Piacenzian, of the Mediterranean, and this taxon is limited to
36
37
that region. This allows to suggest that the recolonization of the Mediterranean Sea
38
39
40 was limited after the late Miocene Messinian Salinity Crisis (see Krijgsman et al.
41
42 [47]).
43
44 P. etrusca is widely considered to be a sister-taxon to the modern monk seals of the
45
46 genus Monachus [9], phylogenetically supporting a Mediterranean origin of the monk
47
48 seals. The research presented in the current study shows a higher diversity of
49
50
Monachinae from the east coast of North America than previously expected,
51
52
53
corroborating with Berta et al.’s [9] alternative hypothesis of a western North Atlantic
54
55 origin for the genus Monachus. This hypothesis assumes that the genus Monachus
56
57
58
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 52 of 76
52

2
3 originated on the east coast of North America and “monachinine ancestral stock then
4
5 presumably dispersed in two directions: (1) to the Mediterranean evolving into
6
7 Pliophoca etrusca; and (2) to the Pacific, which led to the evolution of Monachus
8
9 schauinslandi in Hawaii before close of the Panama Seaway (about 3 Ma)” [9]. Both
10
11
hypotheses depend on the discovery of more complete specimens of late Neogene
12
13
14 Monachinae from the North Atlantic in order to perform phylogenetic analyses and to
15
16 create a solid basis for morphological arguments. However, recent molecular studies
17
18 by Scheel et al. [48] led to the separation of the three monk seals into two distinct
19
20 genera, with the Mediterranean monk seal remaining M. monachus, and the
21
22 Hawaiian and Caribbean monk seals renamed Neomonachus schauinslandi and
23
24
Neomonachus tropicalis, respectively. Both genera appear to have been split 6.3 Ma,
25
26
27 while N. schauinslandi and N. tropicalis diverged approximately 3.67 Ma, around the
28
29 time of closure of the Panama Isthmus [46, 48]

Conclusions
36
37
38
39
40 After a careful revision of the fossil record of the Monachinae from the North Atlantic,
41
42 we contradict Koretsky and Ray’s [4] observation of Pliophoca etrusca on the
43
44 eastcoast of North America during the late Neogene, and we describe two new
45
46
specimens, and new taxa, from North America. This leads us to conclude that
47
48
49 similarities between the Monachinae faunas on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean were
50
51 actually less than previously expected, with Callophoca obscura being found on the
52
53 east coast of North America and in the North Sea Basin, and with Homiphoca sp.
54
55 from the east coast of North America and Cape Province in South Africa (Table 1)

3 and the monachine fauna from North America shows a higher degree of endemism
4
5 than previously assumed.
6
7 Formerly, the vast majority of the fossil record of Monachinae (and by extent
8
9 Phocidae in general) from the Neogene of the North Atlantic was composed of
10
11
isolated specimens. Most notably, the species Callophoca obscura included
12
13
14 thousands of isolated specimens in private and public collections that are not at all
15
16 comparable to the isolated lectotype humerus. Our study strongly advocates ending
17
18 the formerly common practice to use such a syntypic approach to group isolated and
19
20 incomparable specimens on weak and untestable arguments. We strongly encourage
21
22 researchers only to consider complete or nearly complete humeri as potential type
23
24
specimens for fossil Monachinae, in the absence of cranial specimens or more
25
26
27 complete material. Nevertheless, we suggest researchers to be vigilant about
28
29 possible intraspecific variation before identifying new fossil monachine.

Dear Editors,
Dear Reviewers,
Please find attached the revised version of our manuscript “Diversity of late Neogene
Monachinae (Carnivora, Phocidae) from the North Atlantic, with the description of two new
species” After a revision, we would like to resubmit the final manuscript to Royal Society
Open Science. Please note that we changed the title of the manuscript, following the request
of one of the reviewers (description of two new species instead of presentation of two new
species).
We would also like to thank you all for your helpful and constructive comments. In particular
he comments of one reviewer, related to the diagnostic value of humeri for monachine seals.
We implemented all grammar and spelling suggestions and comments from the Associate
Editor and the reviewers. Other suggestions and comments regarding the scientific content
were implemented as well, unless stated otherwise in this Response to Referees letter.
n this letter, we also responded to the questions of the reviewers to clarify certain aspects of
he manuscript. Questions and remarks from the editor and reviewers that require a specific
esponse are addressed below.
Reviewer one (G. Bianucci)
suggest more caution to waste names of taxa previously assigned (e.g. Messiphoca) and to
better support the reasons for considering as diagnostic a bone element and for refusing
others.
=> In the original version of the manuscript, both Messiphoca Muizon, 1981 and Terranectes
Rahmat, Koretsky, Osborne, Alford, 2017 were considered questionable. In the current
version, we stress that Messiphoca requires further studies pending future discoveries,
eaving the question of the validity of the taxon open. We do retain the idea that the
holotypes of both Terranectes species are inadequate to identify them as separate
monachine taxa. Indeed, the Reviewer appears to support the questions we raise regarding
he use of ecomorphotypes to identify taxa (the approach used for Terranectes)
The response to the second point is detailed below.
Concerning this second point, I noted that the authors outline several time in the manuscript
hat the humerus is the most diagnostic postcranial bone but without reporting sufficient
support (also references) to motivate this affirmation. As this regard, the figure 10 showing
he general outlines of some extant humeri briefly discussed in the discussion paragraph is,
n my opinion, not easy to understand and insufficient to clarify the diagnostic value of the
humeri. The two new species described (Auroraphoca atlantica and Virginiaphoca magurai)
are diagnosed respectively on three and four characters of the humeri: are these or other
characters not subject to intraspecific variation in the extant monachine/pinnipeds? I
presume that the authors checked a sufficiently wide sample of humeri of extant pinnipeds
o motivate these diagnoses. If it is true, it would be useful to outline this fact and to provide
precise data in the materials and methods section. Morphometric analysis proposed as future
purpose by the authors could be a useful approach to further support the validity of the
species, but firstly the species must be validated by the characters listed in the diagnosis.
Similarly, to affirm that other postcranial bones have lower diagnostic values and to refuse
he species based on these bones must be supported with solid data based on observation of
a wide sample of specimens belonging to extant species.
=> We understand the Reviewer’s issues, and now cite publications stating the diagnostic
value of the humerus: Møhl (1979), Koretsky (2001) and Meldgaard (2004). They state that
he humerus, ulna, and femur are the most diagnostic postcranial bones in seals. However,
historically, phocid humeri are far more common in the fossil record and, consequently, have
been preferred as type specimens over ulnae and femora.
Following the Reviewer’s remarks, we added a section on the intra- and interspecific
variation in ‘Materials and Methods’. We argue that a detailed study on intra- and
nterspecific variation in seal long bones is outside the scope of this study. However, we
etain Figure 10 (now Figure 1) because it gives a basic visualisation of the degree of
variation present within a single species and between different species. In the revised
manuscript, we now clearly state that the characteristics we present in the diagnoses are
unique and do not represent intraspecific variation. In particular the shape of the
epicondylar/supinator crest in Auroraphoca is present in both specimens attributed to the
axon, but not in any other taxon we observed (including observations of both sexes).
On the whole it is fine, but some parts are repeated several times, weighing down the
eading and making the text less clear. In particular, the taxa and the specimens considered
are listed and described in detail both in the 'Methods and Materials' and in the 'Systematic
Paleontology' paragraphs. In my opinion, the sections 'Taxa considered' and 'Biological
sample' in the 'Methods and Materials' paragraph could be eliminated by transferring in the
systematic paragraph the few information not already repeated.
=> The authors adhere to the Reviewer’s comment. We deleted the sections ‘Taxa
considered’ and the ‘Biological sample’. As the Reviewer suggested, most of it is repeated
ater. Paragraphs that are not repeated, are implemented in the ‘comments’ section of the
Systematic Palaeontology. We retain a small section on the fossil specimen sample, mainly
o outline which fossil taxa we used for comparison. We hope this increases the readability of
he manuscript.
Systematics:
t would be useful at the beginning of the respective diagnosis to list the characters
supporting the assignation of the new species Auroraphoca atlantica and Virginiaphoca
magurai to the Monachinae (in synthesis: what are the characters allowing to refer these
humeri to a monachine?).
=> Previous publications (Berta & Wyss, 1994; Bininda-Emonds & Russell, 1996) showed
hat there are few synapomorphic characteristics separating Monachinae and Phocinae: the
shape of the distal termination of the deltopectoral crest, and the presence of an
entepicondylar foramen. When applicable, these characters are mentioned in the diagnoses,
ollowing the Reviewer’s comment. Note that Homiphoca, Monotherium, and Virginiaphoca
nov. gen. are three extinct Monachinae that retain the plesiomorphic entepicondylar foramen.
Since the paratype of Auroraphoca atlantica besides the humerus, includes a left scapula and
a left ulna, are some characters of these bones significant for the diagnosis?
=> As mentioned in the manuscript, the scapula is incompletely preserved and cannot be
used for the diagnosis, pending the discovery of a more complete scapula associated with a
humerus. We add one characteristic of the ulna that is only shared with Pliophoca etrusca,
but with no other monachine seal.
The authors do not change the diagnosis of Pliophoca etrusca emended by Berta et al.
2015). Perhaps it would be useful to add other characters for the humerus since Berta et al.
isted only a character for this bone ('supinator ridge on humerus absent or poorly
developed').
=> In the revised manuscript, we add one character for the humerus. However, many other
characters are shared with different other taxa. Including these would unnecessarily
complicate the emended diagnosis.
The stratigraphical setting of the whole monachine assemblage here examined evidences
hat the Pliophoca etrusca from the Mediterranean (including referred fragmentary material)
s from the late Pliocene whereas all the fossil monachines from North Atlantic are from late
Miocene-early Pliocene. These different ages should be better outlined when the
Mediterranean and the Atlantic monachinae are compared.
=> The Reviewer is correct, and we stressed this difference better in the Discussion.
n addition, the authors may not be aware of a remain (though very fragmentary) of
Mediterranean Tortonian monachine reported and figured in this work:
Bianucci, G., M. Gatt, R. Catanzariti, S. Sorbi, C. G. Bonavia, R. Curmi, and A. Varola. 2011.
Systematics, biostratigraphy and evolutionary pattern of the Oligo-Miocene marine mammals
rom the Maltese Islands. Geobios 44: 549-585.
=> The authors added this reference. The incompleteness of the femur presented by
Bianucci et al. (2011) does not permit to actively redescribe and discuss the specimen in the
current study. However, it proved a useful reference when discussing the fossil record of
Neogene seals from the Mediterranean Sea in the ‘Discussion’ section.
Figures: All illustrations are of good quality and all necessary with the exception of figure 10
hat in my opinion is poorly informative (see other comments above). I have a strong doubt:
some months ago I gave many photos of Italian fossil monachines to one of the authors (DL)
o be used for comparison. Several of these illustrations were those I cut and prepared for
he tables of the work on the Pliophoca etrusca I published together with Annalisa Berta and
colleagues in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Since Dewaele and colleagues include
several of these cut and prepared photos in their figures (figs. 2E, 3E, 4E, 5E, 6D, 6E, 6F,
7D, 7E, 8E, 8F, 9E), I wonder if it is necessary for them to report in the captions something
as 'modified from Berta et al., 2015'. This especially because a publishing copyright issue,
since the same photos have already been published in JVP. Alternatively, the authors could
eplace these photos with others made by them.
=> The authors prefer to include Figure 10 in the manuscript, despite the comments of the
eviewer. However, we repurpose the figure. Now, it has a more subordinate supporting
unction than in the previous version. In the revised manuscript, the position of the original
Figure 10 changed from the ‘Discussion’ section to the ‘Materials and Methods’ section,
ollowing other remarks by the Reviewer. Hence, this figure is current Figure 1.
Regarding copyrights of the figures: the authors indeed used pictures of bones that have
been illustrated by Berta et al. (2015; Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology). However, we used
he original pictures of the bones we received from Giovanni Bianucci, and not the figures
rom the Berta et al. (2015) publication. The latter are clearly copyrighted by the publisher
Taylor and Francis), but the original pictures of Giovanni Bianucci are not. Irrespective, we
udge that the figures in our manuscript differ too much from the figures of Berta et al. (2015)
o be considered as copyright infringement and that no formal permission to use from Taylor
and Francis is required. However, in the revised version, we acknowledge Giovanni Bianucci
or the figures used.
Further comments of Reviewer Giovanni Bianucci regarding issues on specific lines in the
manuscript and language have been addressed in the revised manuscript.

All comments of Reviewer Annalisa Berta regarding issues on specific lines in the manuscript
have all been addressed in the revised manuscript.
n addition, we took the liberty to add a table (Table 1) presenting measurements of the
holotype humeri of Auroraphoca atlantica and Virginiaphoca magurai. Depending on the
Editor’s preference regarding reviewing, the authors do not judge it mandatory to pass this
able through review. The presented measurements add no new information to the
discussion.
We hope that the revised manuscript is in fulfillment for publication in Royal Society Open
Science.
Sincerely,
Leonard Dewaele and co-authors
