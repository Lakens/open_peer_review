This study examined how overwintering evergreen oaks in Japan compensate for the reduced
carbon gain resulting from late leaf maturation and a shortened photosynthetic period during the
current growing season. They addressed three possible hypotheses regarding the adaptive
mechanisms of the contrasting study species, which include evergreen and deciduous oaks. They
report that the adaptive mechanisms in overwintering Japanese oaks mainly support the
Hypothesis 2: the enhancing of photosynthetic efficiency through leaf physiology. Moreover, they
demonstrate that the universally accepted coordination among leaf physiology and morphology
is partially cancelled out by specific constraints (late leaf maturation and overwintering). They
then compare their data with global leaf trait relationships and show that the correlations
between leaf variables in the regional or biome level do not necessary to correspond with the
global scale analysis. The latter point makes this a very novel and useful study. Over-all I think
this is an excellent study and a very well written paper, including the data analysis and
presentation. There is some literature in this subject area from the United States (including oaks)
that the authors may want to include. I include some of my own work here and the authors may
want to refer to these papers and the others cited in the papers to include here.

Dear Authors
I enjoyed reading your manuscript entitled “Overwintering evergreen oaks reverse typical
relationships between leaf traits in a species spectrum” submitted in Royal Society Open. I agree
with the unpredicted results about the negative correlation between Am and Nm in
overwintering evergreen trees.
In my opinion, most of plant eco-physiologists are usually too biased by typical theory that Am is
always tightly constrained by Nm. It is natural that the wild plants growing on poor soil
including overwintering evergreen oaks don’t always follow the simple theory. I can agree with
your results and intelligible insights into the negative correlation.
However, I am afraid that the number of material trees per species is limited in only one or two.
There should be some reasons for selection of the individual trees. Could you add any more
information of the sample trees in the manuscript, if possible?
As my conclusion, the present manuscript can be published in Royal Society Open as interesting
results that enable audience to approach local-scale nature including the negative correlation
between Am and Nm that is different from global-scale datasets.
I could not find any technical problems in the manuscript, but I really appreciate it if you check
the details of the paper again with your colleagues.
Sincerely yours,

RESPONSE TO REVIEWER 1:
1. There is some literature in this subject area from the United States (including oaks)
that the authors may want to include. I include some of my own work here and the
authors may want to refer to these papers and the others cited in the papers to
include here.

in contrasting successional tree species growing in open and understory sites during a
drought. Tree Physiology 15: 361-370.
Our response: We would like to greatly appreciate the reviewer 1 for giving
constructive comments. By adding these literatures, we can enhance this MS.
Thank you very much for your comment.
In the revised MS, we have added Abrams and Mostoller (1995) in line 49
on page 3, and added Abrams (1990) and Abrams and Kubiske (1990) in line
177 on page 8. However, we did not add Reich et al. (1990), which is related to
the effects of forest fires. That is because forest fires are seldom in Japan. Thus,
we did not mention the effects of forest fires in our MS.
RESPONSE TO REVIEWER 2:
1. I am afraid that the number of material trees per species is limited in only one or two.
There should be some reasons for selection of the individual trees. Could you add
any more information of the sample trees in the manuscript, if possible?
Our response: We examined the leaf gas exchange in the top-canopy leaves of
adult trees. Thus the number of examined individual trees in a species was
limited. However, our obtained data are not aberrant values, comparing the
data published in an evergreen oak in Japan. We added the information in line
187-191 on page 9 in the revised MS. Furthermore, we have added more
detailed information, such as the degree of sun exposure, tree ages and
diameters in the individual trees, in Line 220 to 221 on Page 10 in Materials and
methods. According to the revision, we can more enhance this MS. Thank you
very much for this comment.
2. I could not find any technical problems in the manuscript, but I really appreciate it if
you check the details of the paper again with your colleagues.
Our response: We found simple mistakes and have corrected them:
<U+F0B7> Line 254 on page 12: table S2 -> table S4
<U+F0B7> Supplementary Materials, Table S2: We have changed font colors of the
values of P < 0.05 and P < 0.10 to red and blue, respectively.
