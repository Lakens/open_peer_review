The work presented in this paper is interesting and important to advance in understanding
aerosol behaviour in the atmosphere since the aerosols not only grow but also in some conditions
can suffer from shrinkage.
In general the paper requires an in depth revision of English that make hard in some part to
understand what they mean. I have given below some examples for abstract and introduction but
not for the rest since the paper is full of this kind of English mistakes:

- In abstract what is "OIRs"? It is in bracket "on the inner wall of chamber with different glycerol
to NaNO3 ratios (OIRs)" but it is not clear where this acronym comes from.
- Abstract line 13, it is not clear what the authors mean here: "As to the OIR with 1:1 and 1:3, the

This paper discuss the repartition phenomena of droplets, which is surely important for our
environment and SVOCs research. The optical tweezers with Raman is a good technique to
monitor the organic/inorganic droplets. My suggestion is the authors could add some
background about why glycerol, why NaNO3, why this type of particles, or where this type of
particles influence human being. If the optical tweezer with Raman could analyze other particles,
what kind of particles they will choose? In other words, more practical applications could be
added to the paper.

Title: Repartitioning of Glycerol between Levitated and Surrounding Deposited
Glycerol/NaNO3/H2O droplets
Thank you and reviewers very much for your kind efforts and the constructive
comments and suggestions upon which we have revised the manuscript (yellow
highlighted) as summarized as follows:
Response to Reviewers:
Reviewer #1: The work presented in this paper is interesting and important to advance
in understanding aerosol behaviour in the atmosphere since the aerosols not only grow
but also in some conditions can suffer from shrinkage.
In general, the paper requires an in depth revision of English that make hard in some
part to understand what they mean. I have given below some examples for abstract
and introduction but not for the rest since the paper is full of this kind of English
mistakes:
1. In the abstract line 12, to change: "on the inner wall of chamber with" by "on the
inner wall of a chamber with".
- Thanks for the comment. we have changed it in the revised paper (line 12).
2. In abstract what is "OIRs"? It is in bracket "on the inner wall of chamber with
different glycerol to NaNO3 ratios (OIRs)" but it is not clear where this acronym
comes from..
- Thanks for pointing this out. The correct description has been presented in the
revised paper (lines 12-13).
3. Abstract line 13, it is not clear what the authors mean here: "As to the OIR with 1:1
and 1:3, the repartitioning of glycerol occurs when blowing with constant RH lower
than 45.3% and 55.7%, respectively.
-Thanks for the comment. This sentence has been changed by The levitated
droplets radii with OIR of 1:1 and 1:3 increase with constant RHs are lower than
45.3% and 55.7%, respectively, indicating that the repartitioning of glycerol occurs
(lines 16-18).
4. Introduction line 32. Rewrite the sentence: "Huge fine particles pollution in Beijing
allows accurate rain forecast..."
-Thanks for the comment. We have rewritten the sentence by The serious air
pollution caused by fine particles in Beijing affects the accuracy of weather forecasts
in the revised manuscript (lines 33-34).
5. Introduction. Rewrite the sentence: "The important sources of atmospheric aerosols
are new particles and their.."
-Thanks for the comment. The sentence has been rewritten by New particles
formation and their subsequent growth, which are frequently observed in the
atmosphere [3], are important sources of atmospheric aerosols in the revised
manuscript (lines 35-36).
6. Introduction line 57: "will lead to the shrinkage of the particle." change by: "will
lead to particle shrinkage".
-As suggested, we have changed it in the revised manuscript (line 59).
7. Introduction line 64 "Optical tweezers coupled with Raman spectroscopy is an
efficient for studying the" change by "Optical tweezers couple with Raman
spectroscopy has been an useful tool for studying the...."
-As suggested, we have modified this sentence in the revised manuscript (line
68).
8. The quality of figures needs to be improved. For example, in figure 2 captions are
cut.
-Thanks for the comment. We have improved figure 2 and the captions have been
modified in the revised manuscript (lines 552-555). Meanwhile, we also checked
other figures, and improved figure 3 and figure 4.
In addition, we also checked the whole manuscript, and the mistakes have been
modified in the revised paper, such as the formation and growth of new particles has
attracted much interest  was changed by the formation and growth of new
particles have attracted much interest(line 38); While optical tweezers provides a
good tool for the studies of partitioning between gas and particle phases was changed
by The reported studies show that optical tweezers is a good method to study
partitioning of SVOCs between gas and particle phases (lines 83-84); Once the
hygroscopic response to the RH change is complete was changed by Once the
hygroscopic response to the RH change is completed (lines 200-201), attributed to
the crystallize of was changed by attributed to the crystallization of  (lines
224), on the inner wall of chamber was changed by on the inner wall of the
chamber (lines 225-226). Once the NaNO3 crystallize was changed by Once
NaNO3 crystallizes (lines 226-227), etc.
Reviewer #2: This paper discusses the repartition phenomena of droplets, which is
surely important for our environment and SVOCs research. The optical tweezers with
Raman is a good technique to monitor the organic/inorganic droplets.
1. My suggestion is the authors could add some background about why glycerol, why
NaNO3, why this type of particles, or where this type of particles influence human
being.
-As suggested, we have added some background in the introduction. In the lines
93-95, we added Actually, aerosol particles with different compositions can give
significant impacts on Earth climate and human health (including the respiratory
system, the cardiovascular system, the infectious diseases and even cancer diseases)
[35-37]. In the lines 102-104, we added Although glycerol is a water soluble SVOC
found in atmospheric aerosols [43], it exists as a liquid and does not show
efflorescence RH over its entire RH range, and in the lines 107-108, we added
Glycerol is with three OH groups, which can interact with Na+ and NO3+ ions.
2. If the optical tweezer with Raman could analyze other particles, what kind of
particles they will choose? In other words, more practical applications could be added
to the paper.
-Thanks for the comment, the suggestions are very useful for improving our
manuscript. In the revised paper, we added the corresponding contents as follows:
A single-beam gradient force optical trapping method, i.e. optical tweezers, can
capture and manipulate single particle, 2-10 <U+F06D>m in radius. Since 2004, optical
tweezers coupled with Raman spectroscopy has been a useful tool to investigate the
suspended droplets to simulate the atmospheric environment and probe evolving
particle sizes (with nanometer accuracy), compositions, phases and mixing states
[23-26]. Thus, it can be used to investigate the thermodynamic properties of aerosol
and the kinetics of particle transformation and water transport in the gel or glassy
aerosols [25-34]. For example, using the optical tweezers, Hanford, et al. studied the
hygroscopic proterties of glutaric acid/ ammonium sulfate droplet and glutaric acid/
sodium chloride droplet [27]; Cai, et al. detemined slow water transport in MgSO4
droplets at gel-forming RHs [26], and the hygroscopicity as well as the vapour
pressures of SVOC droplets including dicarboxylic acids and polyalcohols [28,29];
Dennis-Smither, et al. investigated volatility and oxidative aging of maleic acid
aerosol droplets[30]; Tong, et al, determined the timescales for the mass transfer of
water in sucrose and sucrose/ sodium chloride droplets at low RHs [33]; Stewart, et al.
investigated the phase separation RHs and morphologies of polyethylene glycol
/ammonium sulfate and C6-diacids/ammonium sulfate droplets [34]. (Lines 66-82).
Again, we sincerely appreciate the editor and reviewers comments. We hope
that the revision has fully addressed the issues brought up in the review.

3. to change "Key words:" by "Keywords:"
-Thanks for the comment. "Key words:" has been changed by "Keywords:" in the
revised paper (line 26).
4. Add a reference after "..The serious air pollution caused by fine particles in Beijing

-Thanks for the comment. We have added a relevant reference after The serious
air pollution caused by fine particles in Beijing affects..."in the revised paper
(Reference [3], lines 379-380).
5. Rephrase this that does not sound OK: "Glycerol is with three OH groups, which

-Thanks for the comment. The sentence has been changed in the revised

6. This sentence seems to be incomplete: "The mixture of glycerol and NaNO3 with

- Thanks for the comment. we have changed it by The hydroscopic behavior of
the mixture of glycerol and NaNO3 with different OIRs has been studied in the
revised manuscript (lines 108-109).
7. The sentence in lines 118-120 needs to be rewritten since it does not sound OK.
-As suggested, we have changed Previous studies mainly focus on the effect of
glycerol on NaNO3 hygroscopicty, as to the process of glycerol transfer between
different phase states of glycerol/NaNO3/H2O, less attention has been paid by
Previous studies mainly focus on the effect of glycerol on NaNO3 hygroscopicty.

revised paper (line 363).
Again, we sincerely appreciate the editor and reviewers comments. We hope
that the revision has fully addressed the issues brought up in the review.
