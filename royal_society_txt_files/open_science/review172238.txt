1. The XRD results for the samples can be explained more clearly. What could be the possible
reason for the shift in the graphitic peak as observed by the authors? The authors are also
requested to provide an inset in which the graphitic peak XRD region can be shown more clearly.
In the current form, the graphitic peaks are not clear.
2. The authors should use the term few-layer-thick graphene nanosheets wherever applicable.
They should also characterize this thickness using AFM, it would help compare the inferences
obtained from the Raman measurements.
3. The authors are requested to label the figures and provide as much description as possible. In
their current form, they are not conveying as much information as they should. For example, the
FESEM images in figure 2b and 2c are different, but the corresponding information in the
manuscript text is appearing to not explain this difference.
4. The authors mention that the typical size of GNS is 10 nm. Perhaps the authors are referring to
the thickness dimension, it should be clarified. The authors are requested to supplement this
claim with a suitable characterization.
5. The figure 2d is used for indicating the planes. The authors are requested to provide the details
on how these planes were assigned. This can be provided as supporting information. It would be
helpful if more such representative images are included.
5. The absorption spectrum of sample B is distinctly different from sample A. What could be the
possible reason behind this? This aspect needs a thorough explanation and if possible validation
by some experiments.
6. The effect of temperature observed in Figure 5c is interesting. The reason for this observation is
not explained clearly. The authors are requested to make the discussion richer by including more
scientific pieces of evidence and citing suitable references from similar studies.
7. Overall, the manuscript can be improved especially on the front of scientific explanation of the
results.Further, as many as possible additional representative images should be included to
report that these are statistically significant results.
8. There are some sentences which are somewhat unclear can be improved such that the
underlying messages are being conveyed clearly. Some such sentences are listed here as
examples. The authors are requested to thoroughly revisit the manuscript and improve any other
such sentences:
(i) Exciton in nanomaterials, whose charge carriers are confined in the local field and
recombinated quickly before the nonradiative generation, has high recombination probability and
easily produces strong PL.
3
(ii) Carbon-nickel existed surface plasmon resonance, and Ni is widely used as a catalyst for
growing graphene

The authors reported the metal-enhanced photoluminescence of graphene nanosheets grown on a
silicon nanoporous pillar by chemical vapor deposition. The work is interesting. However, there
are still several problems. A major revision is needed before its acceptance.
1. Line 11, Page 2: Ref 8 cannot be used to prove that “excitonic effect plays a critical role in the
optical properties of graphene”, due to that graphene in this reference acts only as a capping
layer who affect the excitons of GaN.
2. Line 6-20, Page 2: The authors claim that “graphene was opted to obtain strong PL due to
exciton.” It’s better to afford relative references here.
3. Line 20, Page 4: It’s better to explain here why the diffraction peak at ~ 26.2º shift and become
stronger for sample B compared to sample A.
4. Figure 2a,b,c, Page 4: It’s better to afford SEM images with higher resolution.
5. Line 37, Page 4: The author claims that the size of GNS was 10 nm. How is it obtained? In
addition, how about the distribution of the layer number?
6. Line 40, Page 5: The absorption spectrum of sample A looks a little strange. How to explain?
7. Line 24, Page 6: The authors attribute the PL peaks at ~525 nm and ~425 nm to the bound and
free excitonic emissions, respectively, which is not so convincing. More explanations should be
afforded here.
8. What is the PL quantum yield of GNS?

ppendix A
authors have prepared a stacked structure of nanoporous pillar array/Ni nanocrystallite/graphene
osheet heterostructure and investigated the photoluminescence properties of the graphene.
idea behind the growth of multilayer film is interesting. But additional efforts to understand various
cts of materials structure and properties, like formation of nanoporous pillar array, Ni
ocrystallite growth mechanism and graphene nanosheet formation are essential. For Example,
1. Cross-sectional Image must be provided to confirm the growth of nanopillars.
2. More scientific explanation is required regarding the connection between Ni melting and Si pillar
size variation
3. Page4, line 33, How does the author claim that Ni melts at 1000 oC? What is the melting point of
Ni?? IN what way it influences the emission? More scientific explanation should be given.
4. Page6, line 57, How does the author claim that, the GNS give birth to strong PL? Did the authors
quantified the emission by measuring the quantum yield?
5. Pristine form of graphene is believed to be metallic in nature and when it is so, how one can get
strong PL emission from it. (No quantification to PL Emission-quantum yield value is missing) If
any emission is coming from graphene then there is possibility of some functional molecules to
give emission. Do the authors have studied about it (the presence of functional molecules)?

Letter to Editor
Dear Editor,
According to the comments and suggestions given by the three
reviewers, we have made a major revision to our manuscript entitled
“Room-temperature excitonic emission with phonon replica from
graphene nanosheets deposited on Ni nanocrystallites/Si nanoporous
pillar array” (RSOS-172238.R1). In addition to language in
introduction, the complete language revision, the structure of the main
text and some experimental results (figures) are rearranged to make the
paper more readable.
The responses to the three reviewers are also presented separately
following the letter.
Any further comments and suggestions would be welcomed by the
authors.
Best wishes!

Responses to the Reviewers’ Comments
Responses to Reviewer: 1
Major revisions have been made all through the
manuscript. Therefore, the responses to the suggestions
on language revision are not included here.
1. The XRD results for the samples can be explained more
clearly. What could be the possible reason for the shift in the
graphitic peak as observed by the authors? The authors are also
requested to provide an inset in which the graphitic peak XRD
region can be shown more clearly. In the current form, the
graphitic peaks are not clear.
Thank you for your suggestions, which are helpful for improving
the quality of this work. More detailed discussions, explanations and
reference about the XRD results have been already added such as
“three diffraction peaks centered at 44.6°, 52.0° and 76.7°were
observed, which were indexed to the diffractions from the (111), (200)
and (220) family planes of cubic Ni (JCPDS No. 04-0850),
respectively. This indicates that Ni has been deposited on Si-NPA after
the CBD process. The XRD pattern of Sample A is shown as the
middle curve in figure 1. Besides the diffraction peaks of cubic Ni,
there appears a broader weak diffraction peak located at 26.2°, which
can be indexed to the diffraction from the (002) reflection planes of
graphene.” and “For the XRD pattern of Sample B (the top curve in
figure 1), it is observed that the diffraction peak of graphene became
slightly stronger than that in Sample A, which indicated the increment
of graphene quantity. Meanwhile, the diffraction peak at ~26.2° shifted
to 26.4°, as seen in the inset of figure 1. The shift of the peak position
implies the decreased interplanar distance of the (002) family planes,
which is due to the stronger van der Waals attraction of increment
layer of GNSs in Sample B. These results imply that graphene has
been deposited on Si-NPA after the CVD reaction in both Sample A
and Sample B.” were added.
The possible reason for the shift in the graphitic XRD peak is GNSs
in Sample B had more layers after longer GNSs growth time at
high-temperature CVD processing compared with Sample A, and a
more compact interlayer spacing was thus formed due to the van der
Waals attraction of layers. The reductive interlayer-spacing would
introduce to the upshift of the diffraction peak according to Bragg's
formula: 2dsin<U+F071>=n<U+F06C>.
The enlarged graphene peaks of XRD patterns have already
provided as an inset in figure 1.
All the mentioned discussions have been supplemented in the
revised manuscript.

B.
2. The authors should use the term few-layer-thick graphene
nanosheets wherever applicable. They should also characterize
this thickness using AFM, it would help compare the inferences
obtained from the Raman measurements.
We had already replaced few-lay and multilayer graphene
nanosheets by few-layer-thick and multilayer-thick graphene
nanosheets respectively, which is really more precise than before.
Thanks to your valuable advices.
According to reviewer's comments, we did the AFM tests and tried
to measure the thickness of the GNSs. But the surface of the nc-Ni,
which was beneath the GNSs as catalyst for the GNSs growth, were
too coarse and out of flatness, we could not determine the thickness of
GNSs and get the number of layers.
3. The authors are requested to label the figures and provide as
much description as possible. In their current form, they are not
conveying as much information as they should. For example, the
FESEM images in figure 2b and 2c are different, but the
corresponding information in the manuscript text is appearing to
not explain this difference.
Figure 2 have been replaced by the FESEM images taken by tilting
the samples with an angle of 45° in order to see more clear the
morphology and structure changes of Si-NPA, Ni/Si-NPA and
GNSs/Si-NPA.
Compared with Ni/Si-NPA in figure 2b, the pillars of Sample A in
figure 2c maintained their morphology and became a little shorter after
the CVD process. It is reported recently that the highest stability
temperature of Ni nanograin is 900 °C [1,2]. Therefore, the
morphology change might be due to the recrystallization and size
growth of nc-Ni under 1000 °C during the CVD process, which was
also corresponding to the narrower full width at half maximum
(FWHM) of Ni XRD peaks in Sample A.
The complementary depiction, the reason of the change and two
references were already offered in the revised manuscript.
Figure 2. Structural characterization of GNSs and substrate: FESEM
image of Si-NPA (a), Ni/Si-NPA (b), Sample A (c) by tilting the
sample with an angle of 45°. (d)HRTEM image of the upper layer
cleaved from Sample A (insets: magnified images of region a and b2).
4. The authors mention that the typical size of GNS is 10 nm.
Perhaps the authors are referring to the thickness dimension, it
should be clarified. The authors are requested to supplement this
claim with a suitable characterization.
Thanks for the reviewer's valuable comments and the original
narrations here are indeed not clear. The 10 nm typical size of GNS are
referring to the lateral size, which has already been signed in the
HRTEM image (region a) and amended as 15 nm <U+F0B4> 8 nm. Meanwhile,
we carefully re-evaluated all the featured geometrical sizes of the
nanocrystallites in Sample A and almost all the descriptions have been
revised.
5. The figure 2d is used for indicating the planes. The authors are
requested to provide the details on how these planes were assigned.
This can be provided as supporting information. It would be
helpful if more such representative images are included.
New assigned details of HRTEM image from the upper layer
cleaved from Sample A have been already supplied (Figure 2d) in the
revised manuscript, and the whole assigned detail of the HRTEM
image was already provided in the supporting information (Figure S1)
to make the constitution and structure of Sample A clear.
Figure S1.The assign details of HRTEM image from the upper layer
cleaved from Sample A. G represent graphene.
6. The absorption spectrum of Sample B is distinctly different
from Sample A. What could be the possible reason behind this?
This aspect needs a thorough explanation and if possible
validation by some experiments.
According to the Reviewer's valuable suggestion, we have retested
the absorption spectrum of Sample B and the new result is as follows:
Figure 4.Absorption spectra of Sample A and B. Inset: band gap of
Sample A. The dashed lines at 3.3 eV (376 nm) marked the leading
edge of the s transition.
The re-evaluated feature and the descriptions have been remodified
in the revised manuscript.
7. The effect of temperature observed in Figure 5c is interesting.
The reason for this observation is not explained clearly. The
authors are requested to make the discussion richer by including
more scientific pieces of evidence and citing suitable references
from similar studies.
Thanks to the reviewer's valuable suggestion, three references
related to exitonic PL with temperature evolution were added in the
revised manuscript.
The discussions “As for the energy difference between the
absorption band-edge (3.3eV) and PL peak energy, a Stokes shift of
0.1 eV should exist and the excitonic emission might originate from
the coupling between the excited electrons and lattice phonons.” and
“Under ultraviolet irradiation with 320 nm, there appeared two broad
emission bands locating at 525 nm and 425 nm, respectively. The
emission line showed regular change tendency with temperature, the
peak locating at 525 nm exhibits an attenuation of the peak intensity,
but the peak intensity of the emission line at 425 nm become stronger.
This effect can be primarily complied with the change in the thermal
occupation of bound and free excitons.” were supplied to help
explaining the reason for the changes of PL peak with temperature
evolution.
8. Overall, the manuscript can be improved especially on the front
of scientific explanation of the results. Further, as many as
possible additional representative images should be included to
report that these are statistically significant results.
Six experimental data were resupplied to make the explanations
more rigorous and scientific. We have still made the major revisions
all through the manuscript to make the paper more readable.
9. There are some sentences which are somewhat unclear can be
improved such that the underlying messages are being conveyed
clearly. Some such sentences are listed here as examples. The
authors are requested to thoroughly revisit the manuscript and
improve any other such sentences:
(i) Exciton in nanomaterials, whose charge carriers are confined in
the local field and recombinated quickly before the nonradiative
generation, has high recombination probability and easily
produces strong PL.
(ii) Carbon-nickel existed surface plasmon resonance, and Ni is
widely used as a catalyst for growing grapheme.
Sentence (i) has been already revised as “In nanomaterials, the
carriers are geometrically confined, which would lead to the quick
recombination of the excitons before nonradiative recombination
occurring. This will lead to high radiative recombination probability
and be helpful to obtain strong PL.”
Sentence (ii) has been already revised as “Because carbon-nickel
material system could produce surface plasmon resonance and nickel
is widely used as a catalyst for growing graphene, preparing graphene
on nc-Ni might be a practical path to enhance the PL of graphene.”
In addition to the complete language revision, the structure of the
main text and some experimental results (figures) are rearranged to
make the paper more readable. Thanks for your arduous work to
improve the quality of the manuscript.

Responses to Reviewer: 2
A Major revision is required and the authors must address all the
comments point by point raised in the attached document.
The authors have prepared a stacked structure of nanoporous
pillar array/Ni nanocrystallite/graphene nanosheet
heterostructure and investigated the photoluminescence properties
of the graphene. The idea behind the growth of multilayer film is
interesting. But additional efforts to understand various aspects of
materials structure and properties, like formation of nanoporous
pillar array, Ni nanocrystallite growth mechanism and graphene
nanosheet formation are essential. For Example,
1. Cross-sectional Image must be provided to confirm the growth
of nanopillars.
Thank you for your valuable suggestions, which are helpful for
improving the quality of this work. Figure 2 have been replaced by the
FESEM images taken by tilting the samples with an angle of 45° in
order to see more clear the morphology and structure of Si-NPA,
Ni/Si-NPA and GNSs/Si-NPA.
Figure2. Structural characterization of GNSs and substrate: FESEM
image of Si-NPA (a), Ni/Si-NPA (b), Sample A (c) by tilting the
sample with an angle of 45°. (d)HRTEM image of the upper layer
cleaved from Sample A (insets: magnified images of region a and b2).
2. More scientific explanation is required regarding the connection
between Ni melting and Si pillar size variation.
This is really a good question. Compared with Ni/Si-NPA in figure
2b, the pillars of Sample A (figure 2c) maintained their shapes and
became a little shorter after CVD process, as shown in figure 2c. It is
reported that the highest stability temperature of Ni nanograin is
900 °C recently [1,2]. Therefore, the morphology change might be due
to the recrystallization and size growth of nc-Ni under 1000 °C during
the CVD process, which was also supported by the narrower full width
at half maximum (FWHM) of nc-Ni XRD peaks of Sample A and B in
figure 1.
More description about the difference of the three samples was
added to the manuscript.
3. Page4, line 33, How does the author claim that Ni melts at 1000
oC? What is the melting point of Ni?? IN what way it influences
the emission? More scientific explanation should be given.
The melting point of bulk Ni is 1453 <U+F0B0>C, but that of the nc-Ni
should be lower [3]. It is reported that the highest stability temperature
of Ni nanograin is 900 °C recently [1,2]. CVD-deposition of GNSs
carried out at 1000 <U+F0B0>C and at such a temperature, the CBD-deposited
nc-Ni would recrystallize and grow up, as mentioned in question 2.
The way Ni nanocrystallites influences the excitonic emission of
GNSs may be as follows: the strong interaction between light and
nc-Ni could lead to the generation of surface plasmons and the
strengthening of near-fields, and carbon-nickel material system could
produce surface plasmon resonance [4]. The excitonic emission of
GNSs strongly interacted with surface plasmons, resulting in
significant improvements in the spectral properties of fluorescent
probes. These improvements include increased intensity and increased
photostability and decreased the life time [5-9].
4. Page6, line 57, How does the author claim that, the GNS give
birth to strong PL? Did the authors quantified the emission by
measuring the quantum yield?
Thanks to the reviewer's valuable suggestion. Based on the
experimental data of PL intensity, we had judged the GNSs gave birth
to strong PL hastily. According to the reviewer's valuable suggestion,
we tested the quantum yield recently and it was measured to be 3.09%
with 320 nm photoexcitation. The revised manuscript had been revised
simultaneously
5. Pristine form of graphene is believed to be metallic in nature
and when it is so, how one can get strong PL emission from it. (No
quantification to PL Emission-quantum yield value is missing) If
any emission is coming from graphene then there is possibility of
some functional molecules to give emission. Do the authors have
studied about it (the presence of functional molecules)?
Graphene emission was usually associated with quantum
confinement and defective states. quantum confinement always
conclude forming nanostructure [10]. Defective states always involved
doping other atoms or condition of the edge sites occupied by other
functional molecules such as H+ [11,12].
Because GNSs were grown by CVD method in the high temperature
(1000 °C) and reducing gas environment of Ar and H2 in our
experiments, PL spectra should originate from the deposited GNSs and
exclude the other functional molecules.

Responses to Reviewer: 3
1. Line 11, Page 2: Ref 8 cannot be used to prove that “excitonic effect plays a
critical role in the optical properties of graphene”, due to that graphene in this
reference acts only as a capping layer who affect the excitons of GaN.
Thanks to the reviewer's valuable suggestion, the reference used here was really not
proper. We have already replaced it with more convictive reference to prove the
excitonic effect plays a critical role in the optical properties of graphene.
2. Line 6-20, Page 2: The authors claim that “graphene was opted to obtain
strong PL due to exciton.” It’s better to afford relative references here.
Base on the excitonic emitting efficiency of InxGa1-xN and the high excitonic
emission of InxGa1-xN nanostructure applied in LEDs [1-3], GNSs, which possess
excitonic emitting efficiency and nanostructure [4], were speculated to have strong
PL.
3. Line 20, Page 4: It’s better to explain here why the diffraction peak at ~ 26.2º
shift and become stronger for Sample B compared to Sample A.
The reason why the diffraction peak at ~ 26.2º shift and become stronger for
Sample B compared to Sample A was as follows: GNSs in Sample B had more layers
after longer GNSs growth time at high-temperature CVD processing compared with
Sample A, and a more compact interlayer spacing was thus formed due to the van der
Waals attraction of layers. The reductive interlayer-spacing would introduce to the
graphene peaks of XRD patterns have already provided as an inset in figure 1.
All the mentioned discussions have been supplemented in the revised manuscript.

4. Figure 2a, b, c, Page 4: It’s better to afford SEM images with higher
resolution.
Figure 2have been replaced by the high resolution FESEM images taken by tilting
the samples with an angle of 45° in order to see more clear the morphology and
structure changes of Si-NPA, Ni/Si-NPA and GNSs/Si-NPA.

(d)HRTEM image of the upper layer cleaved from Sample A (insets: magnified
images of region a and b2).
5. Line 37, Page 4: The author claims that the size of GNS was 10 nm. How is it
obtained? In addition, how about the distribution of the layer number?
Thanks for the reviewer's valuable comments. The ~10 nm typical lateral size of
GNS was got from the HRTEM image and it may be not scientific and exact. It has
been already amended as 15 nm <U+F0B4> 8 nm and the GNS crystallite was already signed in
the HRTEM image. Meanwhile, we carefully re-evaluated all the featured geometrical
sizes of the nanocrystallites in Sample A and almost all the descriptions have been
revised in the manuscript.
Figure 2. Structural characterization of GNSs and substrate: FESEM image of
Si-NPA (a), Ni/Si-NPA (b), Sample A (c) by tilting the sample with an angle of 45°.
(d)HRTEM image of the upper layer cleaved from Sample A (insets: magnified
images of region a and b2).
The spatial resolution of Renishaw (RM-2000) was 500 nm, which is considerable
larger than GNSs (a dozen nm), so we could not get the distribution of the layer number.
The average number of GNSs layer could be gotten 3 layer in Sample A according to
an empirical formula [5]:
<U+0001D6FD>
<U+0001D714><U+0001D43A> (<U+0001D45B>) = <U+0001D714><U+0001D43A> (8) + /<U+0001D45B> ß ˜ 5.5<U+0001D450><U+0001D45A>-1
6. Line 40, Page 5: The absorption spectrum of Sample A looks a little strange.
How to explain?
spectrum of Sample B and the new result is as follows:
Figure 4.Absorption spectra of Sample A and B. Inset: bandgap of Sample A. The
dashed lines at 3.3 eV (376 nm) marked the leading edge of the s transition.
7. Line 24, Page 6: The authors attribute the PL peaks at ~525 nm and ~425 nm
to the bound and free excitonic emissions, respectively, which is not so
convincing. More explanations should be afforded here.
Under ultraviolet irradiation with 320 nm in low-temperature, there appeared two
broad emission bands locating at 525 nm and 425 nm, respectively. The emission line
showed regular change tendency with temperature evolution, the peak locating at 525
nm exhibits an attenuation of the peak intensity, but the peak intensity of the emission
line at 425 nm become stronger. This effect can be primarily complied with the
change in the thermal occupation of bound and free excitons. Thus, given the
temperature evolution of the PL spectrum, the peaks at ~525 and ~425 nm should be
attributed to the bound and free excitonic emissions, respectively [6-8].
Thanks to the reviewer's valuable suggestion, three references related to exitonic
PL with temperature evolution were added to address that the ~525 nm and ~425 nm
peaks should attribute to the bound and free excitonic emissions, respectively .
8. What is the PL quantum yield of GNS?
According to the reviewer's valuable suggestion, we tested the quantum yield
recently and it was measured to be 3.09% with 320 nm photoexcitation. The
measuring result was depicted as follows:

Letter to Editor
Dear Editor,
According to the comments and suggestions given by the editors,
we have made a major revision to our manuscript entitled
“Room-temperature excitonic emission with a phonon replica from
graphene nanosheets deposited on
Ni-nanocrystallites/Si-nanoporous pillar array” (RSOS-172238.R1).
The language revision was supported by a professional language
editing service named ShineWrite (http://www.shinewrite.com). They
claimed all the editors are native English speakers. This paper editing
order is NO. 40-2018061614451420 and the certification file is as
follows:
In addition to the language revision all through the manuscript,
some experimental results (figures) are rearranged to make the paper
more readable.
The electronic supplementary material (ESM) of our previous
revised manuscript RSOS-172238.R1 was crystal plane assigned
details of the HRTEM image of the few-layer thick GNSs/Si-NPA,
which had been already supplied in the figure 2d in the main text. So
we have cancelled the ESM and retained the figure in the main text in
our present submission process (RSOS-172238.R2).
Thanks again to the editor's rigorous and patience. Any further
comments and suggestions would be welcomed by the authors.
Best regards!
