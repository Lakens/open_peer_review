The manuscript by Carlin et al. describes the NMR investigation of thebaine under conditions
used in LC-MS identification. This is a nice paper which presents a clear and concise study,
however, is in need of some additions and clarifications before publication.
1) The supporting 2D NMR data should be made available as Supplementary Information. It is
not clear from the linked PhD thesis where to find this information.
2) The peaks in mass spectra shown in Figures 1b and 1c should be identified. Given a molecular
mass of 311 Da for thebaine, I would assume the peak at 281 Da arises from the loss of MeO?
3) It would be useful to show the mass spectrum corresponding to the chromatogram in Figure 5.
4) It would be useful to add further information on the LC conditions used. Two solvent systems
are described. Are these used in gradient or isocratic mode? If gradient, what is the profile over
what time frame (maybe add this information to Figure 1), or if isocratic what is the relative
amounts of the two solvents?
5) The descriptions of exchange need to be clarified. The authors state that in the 50:50 solvent
mixture (Figure 3b) the signals are consistent with slow exchange. The broad nature of these
signals is more likely to arise from intermediate exchange. Slow exchange would typically give
rise to sharper signals at the average chemical shift.
6) The identification of the thebaine-D+ species as a single epimer in Figure 3c is unlikely. If
Figures 3a and 3d are showing two epimers, then one should assume that each signal of the
highlighted pairs arises from one of the epimers. If in Figure 3c a single epimer were produced,
then I would expect that signal have the same chemical shift as one of the epimers in Figures 3a
or 3d. Since in Figure 3c the signal appears at the average of the two epimer positions, I would
therefore conclude that the signal in Figure 3c arises from the fast exchange of the two thebaine
epimers.
7) In page 6 the authors argue that a single structural form of thebaine has been obtained,
however, previously they argued for a rapid exchange. Both cannot be true simultaneously.
8) The authors should take care with the term acidity. The acidity (how defined?) or pH will be
dependent on the solvent composition as well as the amount of added acetic acid. The authors
note that the results appear to depend on solvent composition rather than acidity.
9) The authors explanation of the results presented is mostly sound. However, could be
elaborated further. On a per mole basis, there is 5 times more acetic acid present than thebaine in
the sample. At high [D2O], the nitrogen is effectively saturated, giving rise to two epimers. As the
[D2O] is reduced, the amount of D+ decreases, hence the nitrogen is no longer saturated and
exchange is observed between the two epimers as indicated by the mechanism in Figure 4. It
would be interesting to see what effect a stronger acid had. I would presume that the nitrogen
would remain saturated to a lower [D2O] concentration, and hence two epimers being observed
to lower [D2O].
10) A comment as to whether similar effects are seen / expected for other alkoloids could be
added. The other alkaloids mentioned are structurally very similar so a similar mechanism would
be likely?

More data needs to be provided to support the conclusion. For example, the authors mentioned
experiments have been don with 1H-1H COSY and 13C NMR to support the signals, but no data
was provided. A clear peak assignment is highly recommended for all the NMR spectra
provided. Also, it is stated that 'further studies we have undertaken on thebaine and other opiate
alkaloids at lower acid levels reveals the rate of exchange of epimer forms is acidity dependent',
but again, no detailed data was provided. It is difficult to make sound conclusion without such
data set.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript by Carlin et al. describes the NMR investigation of thebaine under conditions used in LC-
MS identification. This is a nice paper which presents a clear and concise study, however, is in need of
some additions and clarifications before publication.
1) The supporting 2D NMR data should be made available as Supplementary Information. It is not clear
from the linked PhD thesis where to find this information.
Author response: It wouldnt be normal to itemise every snippet of information derived (or derivable)
from a standard COSY type 2D spectrum as its a recognised confirmatory tool for structural elucidation
and for original peak assignment. Neither of these latter two are particularly relevant here as both the
structure is known (now referenced in manuscript) and the peak assignment has essentially been
established in earlier papers (now referenced in manuscript). The main alternative purpose of the 1H
COSY is (would be) therefore to differentiate/distinguish key (not all) corresponding signals from
separate epimers; the different proportions of the two isomers can be done by inspection of the 1D
spectra.
Text has now been modified as follows: However, assignments of signals on NMR spectra were made in
reference to previously published analyses12-15 and use 2D HH and HC COSY to support these
conclusions.
2) The peaks in mass spectra shown in Figures 1b and 1c should be identified. Given a molecular mass
of 311 Da for thebaine, I would assume the peak at 281 Da arises from the loss of MeO?
Author response: the structures of the ions have now been added to the mass spectrum on Figure 1.
3) It would be useful to show the mass spectrum corresponding to the chromatogram in Figure 5.
Author response: an extended mass spectrum identifying the expected ions for thebaine plus the
molecular ion and one other ion confirming the presence of thebaine only. Work carried out by other
researchers in the same area has also been cited to support the proposed structures of the ions.
4) It would be useful to add further information on the LC conditions used. Two solvent systems are
described. Are these used in gradient or isocratic mode? If gradient, what is the profile over what time
frame (maybe add this information to Figure 1), or if isocratic what is the relative amounts of the two
solvents?
Author response: The gradient LC method has been added as a separate table (new Table 1).
5) The descriptions of exchange need to be clarified. The authors state that in the 50:50 solvent mixture
(Figure 3b) the signals are consistent with slow exchange. The broad nature of these signals is more
ikely to arise from intermediate exchange. Slow exchange would typically give rise to sharper signals at
the average chemical shift.
Author response: This was a small error and has been modified to explain the broad peaks are
consistent with a rapid exchange between the two epimers.
6) The identification of the thebaine-D+ species as a single epimer in Figure 3c is unlikely. If Figures 3a
and 3d are showing two epimers, then one should assume that each signal of the highlighted pairs arises
from one of the epimers. If in Figure 3c a single epimer were produced, then I would expect that signal
have the same chemical shift as one of the epimers in Figures 3a or 3d. Since in Figure 3c the signal
appears at the average of the two epimer positions, I would therefore conclude that the signal in Figure
3c arises from the fast exchange of the two thebaine epimers.
Author response: It is perhaps possible that the spectrum from 3c shows a faster exchange than is
observed in 3a and 3d however, not as fast as is observed in 3b. This has been added to the text.
7) In page 6 the authors argue that a single structural form of thebaine has been obtained, however,
previously they argued for a rapid exchange. Both cannot be true simultaneously.
Author response: text amended appropriately.
8) The authors should take care with the term acidity. The acidity (how defined?) or pH will be
dependent on the solvent composition as well as the amount of added acetic acid. The authors note that
the results appear to depend on solvent composition rather than acidity.
Author response: the term acidity has been changed to pH.
9) The authors explanation of the results presented is mostly sound. However, could be elaborated
further. On a per mole basis, there is 5 times more acetic acid present than thebaine in the sample. At
high [D2O], the nitrogen is effectively saturated, giving rise to two epimers. As the [D2O] is reduced,
the amount of D+ decreases, hence the nitrogen is no longer saturated and exchange is observed
between the two epimers as indicated by the mechanism in Figure 4. It would be interesting to see what
effect a stronger acid had. I would presume that the nitrogen would remain saturated to a lower [D2O]
concentration, and hence two epimers being observed to lower [D2O].
Author response: Agreed. A modified version of this paragraph has been included in the paper.
10) A comment as to whether similar effects are seen / expected for other alkaloids could be added. The
other alkaloids mentioned are structurally very similar so a similar mechanism would be likely?
Author response: work has already been completed with morphine. By examining the NMR spectrum
now added to the paper, Figure 6) appears to be from a single epimer although in principle again there
are 2 epimeric protonated forms of morphine (as with thebaine) but little literature on this appears
evident. There are some interesting shallow (weak) broad humps (e.g. those at 2.3 and 1.9 ppm).
Given that thebaine has two clearly distinguishable epimers in its NMR spectrum in D2O there is no
reason why morphine shouldnt show similar behaviour- these weak/broad signals may herald this.
However, in one authors practical experience (MGC), no observation of multiple peaks in the associated
chromatograms have been observed in LC-MS for morphine.

However, assignments of signals on NMR spectra were made in reference to previously published

nformation/supporting NMR spectra have been included in the text for morphine (and codeine).
