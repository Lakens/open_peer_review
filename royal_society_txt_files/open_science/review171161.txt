This paper reported a probe called BT with strong donor-p-acceptor structure, and the results
showed that this probe has both colorimetric and fluorescent sensing ability to Cu2+ with high
selectivity and sensitivity. It is a piece of interesting work. The presentation is clear and language
is acceptable. So I recommend it to be accepted as it is for publication in this journal.

In this manuscript, the authors report a solid-state Cu(II) strip based on probe BT, which can
detect Cu(II) by dual channel of colorimetric and fluorescent responses. The selectivity and
sensitivity of the Cu(II)-strip are good enough for on-site analysis of Cu(II) in aqueous
environment. The sensor could also work well on a test strip, making the sensor portable and
applicable for realistic applications. The paper is well prepared, and the data are adequate. So I
recommend publication of the manuscript after minor revision.
1. The authors should pay more attention to the writing, especially the use of the present perfect
tense.
Page 1, last sentence, “developing a Cu2+ strip, which can easily response to different”, here
“response” should be changed to “respond”. Page 1, line 45, “In considering this issue” should be
corrected to “Considering this issue”.
In Results and Discussion part, Page 3, last sentence, “BT solution with Ni2+ showed certain
absorbance at 417 nm,” here “certain absorbance” should be corrected to “a weak shoulder
band”.
Page 4, “thus photon-induced electron transfer (PET) may occurred and affect the fluorescence
emission of BT.” Here “occurred” should be “occur”. In last paragraph, “although Fe3+ can make
the absorption peak slight blue-shift”, here “slight” should be changed to “slightly”. “In Figure
3
3b, Cu2+ can quench the fluorescence of BT solution efficiently even if the other metal ions had
been existed”, here “had been” should be changed to “are”. “when detect Cu2+ in both
colorimetric and fluorescent mode”, here “detect” should be “detecting”.
Page 6, “From the normalized absorption signal response to changing Cu2+”, here “changing
Cu2+” should be corrected to “the concentration of Cu2+”.
2. Some related papers should be cited, for example, “Polymer 2008, 49, 3716–3721” and “Chem.
Lett. 2016, 45, 570–572”.
3. It is not proper to define the sensor as a “lab-on-chip”, the authors had better delete the related
expressions.

where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal

Page 1, last sentence, “developing a Cu2+ strip, which can easily response to different”, here
“response” should be changed to “respond”. Page 1, line 45, “In considering this issue” should be

In Results and Discussion part, Page 3, last sentence, “BT solution with Ni2+ showed certain

Page 6, “From the normalized absorption signal response to changing Cu2+”, here “changing
Cu2+” should be corrected to “the concentration of Cu2+”.
Response 1: Thanks for the good suggestions, and we have revised the manuscript carefully
according to the comments as follows:
Page 1, Line 58: As a result, developing a Cu2+ strip, which can easily respond to different Cu2+
concentration is really……
Page 1, Line 45: Considering this issue, the maximum permissible level of Cu2+ in drinking water
has been determined……
Page 3, Line 58: BT solution with Ni2+ showed a weak shoulder band at 417 nm……
Page 4, Line 11: thus photon-induced electron transfer (PET) may occur and affect the
fluorescence emission of BT.
Page 4, Line 55: although Fe3+ can make the absorption peak slightly blue-shift and……
Page 5, Line 3: In Figure 3b, Cu2+ can quench the fluorescence of BT solution efficiently even if
the other metal ions are existed.
Page 5, Line 7: In general, the probe BT demonstrated good anti-interference ability when
detecting Cu2+ in both colorimetric and fluorescent mode.
Page 6, Line 10: From the normalized absorption signal response to the concentration of Cu2+
(Figure 5b)……
2. Some related papers should be cited, for example, “Polymer 2008, 49, 3716–3721” and “Chem.
Lett. 2016, 45, 570–572”.
Response 2: We have cited these two papers as reference 19 and 20, and revised the order
numbers of other references.

Some colorimetric and fluorescent Cu2+ probes have already been reported with high sensitivity
and selectivity,12-20……

3. It is not proper to define the sensor as a “lab-on-chip”, the authors had better delete the related

Response 3: We have revised the expressions as follows:
“On the other hand, solid-state sensors become prosperous in the latest several decades, such as
dipstick and lateral-flow assays, which are based on the blotting of analytes onto a paper pre-
stained with probes”
Meanwhile, we changed the keywords “lab-on-chip” to “solid-state sensor”.
