Burchardt et al tested whether three types of vocalizations with different purposes (echolocation
and two communication calls) in the bat species Saccopteryx bilineata possess a rhythmic pattern.
They found rhythmicity in the frequency range of 6-10 Hz (echolocation) and 10-20 Hz (territorial
song, isolation calls).
The analysis is based on a large dataset, it is well conducted and supported by two different
methods (isochronous signal-derived pulse, and a FFT analysis), and is also well and clearly
presented.
I have a few main thoughts, though, which mainly relate to the presented context and the
interpretation of the results:
1) The authors’ main result is that they found a rhythm, in the frequency band of 5-20 Hz. I have
two thoughts about this result:
a) first, I wonder how surprising is this result? Many biological processes possess an inherent
rhythmicity (circadian rhythms, gait, likely any muscular movement, etc…), owing to many
functional constraints and having multiple benefits (e.g., improved perception due to attention,
synchronization with day length, etc.) – as the authors explain in the introduction. Lacking
surprise obviously does not affect scientific quality – but it might affect the focus of the
presentation, which might be more on the quantification of the rhythm’s frequency and its
variation. I believe that the paper would benefit if the authors compared the rhythm they found
in bat vocalizations to the rhythm in other animals – where are similarities and differences, and
are there functional reasons for this?
b) Regarding this quantification, the authors show that a random sample of call and gap
durations fits the isochronous frequency worse than the real calls, confirming that the calls are
more rhythmic than by chance. I believe though that the paper would benefit if the authors could
not only show that there is a rhythm, but could additionally quantify how well this isochronous
frequency matches the real sequence. For example, when looking at Fig. 1B (territorial song
example) it is clear that the rhythm in the vocalization is not isochronous, but changes over time:
calls are emitted at a higher rate at the start than at the end (as call duration also changes).
Would it be possible to use the (frequency-corrected) temporal deviation ((F)RMSD to evaluate
and discuss the precision?
2) The authors argue that they found similar rhythms for all three call types, and this notion is
present throughout a large part of the discussion. I think that this claim of similarity is not well
supported: the histogram in Fig. 3 clearly shows that the frequency range 6-10 Hz is the dominant
one in echolocation, while this frequency range is almost not present in the other two vocalization
types. In contrast, in those two types, the 10-20 Hz band dominates strongly; while in
echolocation, this band has only 0.4x the magnitude than the 6-10 Hz band (and is not much
larger than the subsequent frequency bands after the prominent frequency band for the other two
vocalizations).
Playing the devil’s advocate, I think that the presented data can equally well support the
conclusion that the dominant frequency bands DIFFER between echolocation and social
3
vocalizations. Whether this difference of a few Hz is regarded as similar or dissimilar will also
depend on what is considered as a relevant biological difference – but this is not explained and
justified by the authors.
I believe that the manuscript would be stronger if:
a) the authors would put their results into a quantitative context of what was found in other
species. They currently report that rhythms were found in other species, but not the frequencies
as well as the variation. This might help to argue for a similarity.
b) the authors should justify why they believe that the clear difference in the histogram is not
biologically relevant (if the uphold their statement that the rhythms have similar frequencies).
Maybe some additional statistics or different presentations of the results would also help:
Classically, the distributions or the mean/median of the (log-transformed) rhythm frequency
would be statistically compared to infer a difference or not. In addition, I was wondering why a
histogram with a rather coarse resolution of 10 Hz was used, instead of e.g. a violin plot
including the raw data (Fig. 3). Likewise for Fig 4 – I believe that a jittered scatter plot of the raw
data and it’s central tendency (plus maybe additional open circle to show the clusters) would
provide more information to the reader about the underlying data.
c) A main line in the argument of similarity is the coupling of wingbeat and echolocation, and
attentional processes that are facilitated by a regular pattern (= allowing the animal to assign
attention to expected future events). This is correct, but I am not yet convinced that wingbeat-
echolocation coupling is the underlying reason for a similar (if it is similar) rhythm in
communication calls. Crucially, communication is likely phylogenetically older than echolocation
– i.e., bats and their ancestors will have communicated with each other before taking to the air
and before echolocating. Arguably, the communication calls of those ancestors will have had a
rhythm to facilitate attention, possibly coupled to theta-rhythms. After active flight and
echolocation have evolved, multiple scenarios might have happened: i) echolocation and flight
use a different frequency band than communication (due to their own constraints, e.g. breathing
rhythm, muscle physiology, aerodynamics, maneuverability,…); ii) E + F might use the same
frequency band as communication (e.g., to exploit existing attentional processes); iii) or
communication calls might have subsequently changed their rhythm to those used by E + F.
I think the authors should consider those alternative evolutionary scenarios; and not assume that
the rhythm of communication calls must be constrained by echolocation and wing beat.
3) The introduction and discussion feel a bit lengthy to me, and would benefit IMHO from some
streamlining to reduce redundancy and to focus on the main points/hypotheses/predictions.
Particularly in the discussion, the text on wingbeat-echolocation coupling could be condensed. I
believe that the prediction (mentioned at the end of the introduction) about individual differences
in pulse frequencies was not addressed again later.

DETAILED COMMENTS, in order of reading (numbers refer to line numbers), ranging from the
main comments above, over minor points regarding details for clarification or improving IMHO
the readability, to style (which obviously is at the author’s discretion).
20, and elsewhere: physically, a pulse is defined as a single short event. In my opinion, it would
be more correct to speak of an “isochronous signal-derived pulse TRAIN” throughout the
manuscript.
Additionally, I’m not sure whether it is relevant to highlight this pulseS so strongly already in the
second sentence of the abstract. From my reading, the main point of the paper is to having found
a regular rhythm in three different vocalizations, which is supported by two methods (pulseS,
and FFT). It is not clear to me why the authors highlight the (methodological aspect of the) pulseS
4
so much throughout the manuscript, instead of the more general finding of the regular rhythm.
(SEE METHODS COMMENT ABOVE?)
Abstract, Introduction, and discussion: I personally am not a big fan of motivating animal
research with the understanding of human traits, the benefits for humans, or other applications –
at least if this is not the prime purpose of the research. IMHO, this eventually will lead to
increasing devaluation of animal research, and blue-sky research in general. While language,
musicality and its evolution are highly interesting and also need to be addressed with animal
models, I am not sure if this paper benefits by motivating it by human musicality and its
evolution. This is not to diminish and criticize this work! IMHO, it is very interesting to
investigate the occurrence of rhythmic activity in animals, its generality, its benefits and
evolutionary reasons. I believe the paper would become stronger if its results would be linked
more to existing research on animal rhythms.
100-102: a wingbeat of 6-12 Hz is said to “correspond” to echolocation call intervals of 10-20 Hz.
To me, this appears like a rather weak correspondence of rather different frequency ranges (0.7
octaves difference!).
103-104: the prediction here (“isochr pulses with freqs between approx. 6-20 Hz”) contradicts the
text in the abstract (“we expected PulseS frequencies around 6-12 Hz”). Please correct, and
specify why one or the other prediction was made.
105: than > that
117ff: “In isolation calls… call is the unit.”: These sentences are partially redundant to the
previous sentences. The first sentence was likely intended to highlight that each element within a
single isolation call and song is the unit (in contrast to echolocation, where the call is the unit,
since it has no sub-elements).
142: please state already here that only one echolocation recording per individual was used (this
information could then possibly be omitted from later in the MS). Echolocation pulse rate is
strongly influenced by context and background structure. Please briefly describe the release site
(open, edge space?) of the bats and if the recorded release echolocation calls differ from
search/commute calls under more natural conditions. Why weren’t search/commute calls of
free-flying non-released bats used (I see that this cannot control for individual identity, but still
might give a more realistic picture?).
Some methodological details of the GAT approach are unclear to me:
160: “because very few values…windows.”: To me, this statement is unclear. Values = PulseS-
frequencies?
161: “For each pulse, we calculated the RMSD of all elements in a vocalization from their nearest
single pulse”. I think this sentence is wrong – it starts by saying that something was done for each
pulse (=calculating the RMSD), and then concludes that the RMSD was calculated for each
vocalization to its (ONE) nearest single pulse. I believe it should be: “for each pulseS frequency /
For each isochronous signal-derived pulse train frequency / Or just: for each isochronous
frequency,…”.
162: It should be specified that the RMSD is the TEMPORAL deviation between call onset and
pulse onset.
163: “Pulses were offset to minimize the RMSD”. I see the need for this and believe I understand,
yet the description could be more detailed. Was each element sequence tested for each
isochronous frequency at multiple temporal offsets? If yes, what was the resolution of the offset
(did it match the 0.01 Hz resolution of the isochronous frequency?); and how much was it offset
(+/- half a phase?)?
5
170: I was generally wondering why a clustering algorithm was preferred for summarizing the
isochronous frequencies, over reporting mean/medians and variation measures of the (log(10)-
transformed) data?
While the clusters in Fig. 4 give a great intuitive feeling for the data, it is difficult to assess the
frequency range encompassed by a single cluster. For example, 70% of the rhythm frequencies of
pup # 22 cluster at about 16-17 Hz. What is not clear from this plot, however, is how much the
actual frequencies within that cluster vary around 16-17 Hz.
Please indicate in the legend of Figure 4, whether the radius or the area of the circle is scaled to
the percentage of the cluster (it should be the area, not the radius).
184: The phrase “we created two different types of artificial vocalizations” set me on the wrong
track, assuming that the authors created artificial wav-files. I think more precise would be “We
created artificial temporal vocalization patterns based on the previously measured element and
gap durations”.
For me, the model abbreviations (S and R) were initially a bit odd, since it is not clear at first
glance what the letters stand for. Why not just 1 and 2? Or use full names, such as “sequence-
intact-model” and “sequence randomized model”?
194: “General statistics for modelled and original durations were similar”. This is too short –
which statistics are meant? (And why would they be different, given that modelled durations
originate from the original ones?)
204: Why was such a coarse time resolution of 5 ms used for the FFT analysis? The original time
data (element on- and offset) was likely measured at higher temporal resolution. I tried to
understand the potential implications of this - here are just some thoughts: does this coarse
resolution affect the precision of the FFT-analysis? And isn’t this somehow at odds with the very
highly resolved PulseS analysis at steps of 0.01 Hz (= up to 0.05 ms at 100 Hz)?
Results, Isochronous pulses (225 ff)
I have some issues with the regularly occurring statement of having found a similar rhythm
across all three vocalizations – see main comment above.
Fig. 3: The bar drawn at 0-10 Hz actually only contains frequencies between 6-10 Hz. I know that
it would look odd, but it would be more precise if the bar was narrower to encompass only this
range. Alternatively, maybe another plot type might visualize the data even better, such as a
violin plot containing the raw data and a (much finer) histogram? Is there a reason for having
chosen the rather large bar widths of 10 Hz?
Fig. 4 and L. 231 ff: I think it would be beneficial if the authors marked those calls in Fig. 4 that
cluster in the frequency range they consider (6-20 Hz), i.e., the 19 (out of 25) isolation calls and the
8 (out of 14) songs. I found it difficult to identify them myself, particularly for the song calls.
What was the criterion for saying that a cluster was within the frequency range? For the isolation
call, I would have excluded 4-5 individuals (5, 11, 12, 13), maybe also #7 (because of two clusters,
one inside, one outside the range). However, if #2 is included, then the largest clusters listed in
the text would start at 20% (not 30%). Please add details of the criteria.
256: “optimal pulse” seems awkward phrasing. “dominant frequency” would be better; or other
alternatives.
272-274: “Element onsets coincided … between 6-20 Hz…. DETAILED ANALYSIS showed
that…” This makes it sound as if two separate analyses (a first general one, and a second detailed
one) were run – please rephrase. And see my thoughts about similarity/difference of frequency
bands across vocalizations.
6
283: “surprisingly similar” – Why is this surprising? Which difference would not be surprising?
See main comments regarding this topic.
307-339: I found this part overly long and believe that it can be condensed for clarity.
337: “the method at hand (GAT approach)” > “the GAT approach”
340 ff: “PulseS of echolocation call sequences … also fitted best for social vocalizations”: see main
comment on similarity or not of frequencies, and the clear difference in the spectrum between
those call types (Fig 3, Fig S1)
Fig. 2 and 4: Shouldn’t RMSD and FRMSD have unit (s and s*s)? And it’s a bit uncommon to have
the x-axis at the top of Fig 2.

The authors investigate the rhythmic nature of three different vocalisation types produced by
Saccopteryx billineata, echolocation, song and isolation calls and find surprisingly similar
rhythms across the three. The study is well written and brings across the major points in a nice
and understandable way. The analysis (within my area of expertise) is scientifically sound and
well performed, I am looking forward to seeing the study published,

160: “because very few values…windows.”: To me, this statement is unclear. Values = PulseS-
frequencies?
161: “For each pulse, we calculated the RMSD of all elements in a vocalization from their nearest
single pulse”. I think this sentence is wrong – it starts by saying that something was done for each
pulse (=calculating the RMSD), and then concludes that the RMSD was calculated for each
vocalization to its (ONE) nearest single pulse. I believe it should be: “for each pulseS frequency /
12
For each isochronous signal-derived pulse train frequency / Or just: for each isochronous
frequency,…”.
162: It should be specified that the RMSD is the TEMPORAL deviation between call onset and
pulse onset.
163: “Pulses were offset to minimize the RMSD”. I see the need for this and believe I understand,
yet the description could be more detailed. Was each element sequence tested for each
isochronous frequency at multiple temporal offsets? If yes, what was the resolution of the offset
(did it match the 0.01 Hz resolution of the isochronous frequency?); and how much was it offset
(+/- half a phase?)?
170: I was generally wondering why a clustering algorithm was preferred for summarizing the
isochronous frequencies, over reporting mean/medians and variation measures of the (log(10)-
transformed) data?
While the clusters in Fig. 4 give a great intuitive feeling for the data, it is difficult to assess the
frequency range encompassed by a single cluster. For example, 70% of the rhythm frequencies of
pup # 22 cluster at about 16-17 Hz. What is not clear from this plot, however, is how much the
actual frequencies within that cluster vary around 16-17 Hz.
Please indicate in the legend of Figure 4, whether the radius or the area of the circle is scaled to
the percentage of the cluster (it should be the area, not the radius).
184: The phrase “we created two different types of artificial vocalizations” set me on the wrong
track, assuming that the authors created artificial wav-files. I think more precise would be “We
created artificial temporal vocalization patterns based on the previously measured element and
gap durations”.
For me, the model abbreviations (S and R) were initially a bit odd, since it is not clear at first
glance what the letters stand for. Why not just 1 and 2? Or use full names, such as “sequence-
intact-model” and “sequence randomized model”?
194: “General statistics for modelled and original durations were similar”. This is too short –
which statistics are meant? (And why would they be different, given that modelled durations
originate from the original ones?)
204: Why was such a coarse time resolution of 5 ms used for the FFT analysis? The original time
data (element on- and offset) was likely measured at higher temporal resolution. I tried to
understand the potential implications of this - here are just some thoughts: does this coarse
resolution affect the precision of the FFT-analysis? And isn’t this somehow at odds with the very
highly resolved PulseS analysis at steps of 0.01 Hz (= up to 0.05 ms at 100 Hz)?
Results, Isochronous pulses (225 ff)
I have some issues with the regularly occurring statement of having found a similar rhythm
across all three vocalizations – see main comment above.
Fig. 3: The bar drawn at 0-10 Hz actually only contains frequencies between 6-10 Hz. I know that
it would look odd, but it would be more precise if the bar was narrower to encompass only this
range. Alternatively, maybe another plot type might visualize the data even better, such as a
violin plot containing the raw data and a (much finer) histogram? Is there a reason for having
chosen the rather large bar widths of 10 Hz?
Fig. 4 and L. 231 ff: I think it would be beneficial if the authors marked those calls in Fig. 4 that
cluster in the frequency range they consider (6-20 Hz), i.e., the 19 (out of 25) isolation calls and the
8 (out of 14) songs. I found it difficult to identify them myself, particularly for the song calls.
What was the criterion for saying that a cluster was within the frequency range? For the isolation
call, I would have excluded 4-5 individuals (5, 11, 12, 13), maybe also #7 (because of two clusters,
13
one inside, one outside the range). However, if #2 is included, then the largest clusters listed in
the text would start at 20% (not 30%). Please add details of the criteria.
256: “optimal pulse” seems awkward phrasing. “dominant frequency” would be better; or other
alternatives.
272-274: “Element onsets coincided … between 6-20 Hz…. DETAILED ANALYSIS showed
that…” This makes it sound as if two separate analyses (a first general one, and a second detailed
one) were run – please rephrase. And see my thoughts about similarity/difference of frequency
bands across vocalizations.
283: “surprisingly similar” – Why is this surprising? Which difference would not be surprising?
See main comments regarding this topic.
307-339: I found this part overly long and believe that it can be condensed for clarity.
337: “the method at hand (GAT approach)” > “the GAT approach”
340 ff: “PulseS of echolocation call sequences … also fitted best for social vocalizations”: see main
comment on similarity or not of frequencies, and the clear difference in the spectrum between
those call types (Fig 3, Fig S1)
Fig. 2 and 4: Shouldn’t RMSD and FRMSD have unit (s and s*s)? And it’s a bit uncommon to have
the x-axis at the top of Fig 2.
References: The authors want to give the references are careful read. There are a number of
inconsistencies/errors, such as capitalization or not of title words, missing italics and wrong
dashes in species names, or typos in title and journal (ref 42), missing journal (5) etc

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors investigate the rhythmic nature of three different vocalisation types produced by
Saccopteryx billineata, echolocation, song and isolation calls and find surprisingly similar
rhythms across the three. The study is well written and brings across the major points in a nice
and understandable way. The analysis (within my area of expertise) is scientifically sound and
well performed, I am looking forward to seeing the study published,

I congratulate the authors to a well-done study and revision.
There is just one slight improvement I’d like to suggest for the unit of FRMSD. Thanks for
correcting me that FRMSD is unit-less, calculated as RMSD (s) * frequency (1/s):
Frequency is the inverse of period: frequency = 1/period, so: FRMSD = RMSD * 1/period =
RMSD / period.
Thus, the value of FRMSD describes the average temporal deviation as a fraction of the full cycle;
a value of 0.13 for the isolation call data means that the average deviation is 0.13 of a full cycle. I
only realized this now and believe that this would be relevant for the reader; a potential unit thus
could be “fraction of cycle” or “fraction of phase”. I think this would help the reader a lot to
interpret the meaning of the FMRSD values, i.e., to understand that a FRMSD of 0.13 (original
isolation calls) is not only less than 0.15 (model 1 of isolation calls), but also what it means in
absolute terms (= average temporal variation of 13% of a full cycle).

We thank Dr. Görlitz and one anonymous reviewer for their time and helpful
suggestions. The reviewers’ comments were greatly appreciated and we have
followed their suggestions whenever possible. When we have not followed a
suggestion, we have provided a justification for doing so. Below, we describe in
detail how we have revised the manuscript by addressing each
suggestion/comment separately. Line numbers refer to the revised manuscript.
Changes in the revised manuscript are highlighted.
Reviewer #1
Burchardt et al tested whether three types of vocalizations
with different purposes (echolocation and two communication
calls) in the bat species Saccopteryx bilineata possess a
rhythmic pattern. They found rhythmicity in the frequency range
of 6-10 Hz (echolocation) and 10-20 Hz (territorial song,
isolation calls).
The analysis is based on a large dataset, it is well conducted
and supported by two different methods (isochronous signal-
derived pulse, and a FFT analysis), and is also well and
clearly presented.
I have a few main thoughts, though, which mainly relate to the
presented context and the interpretation of the results:
1) The authors’ main result is that they found a rhythm, in the
frequency band of 5-20 Hz. I have two thoughts about this
result:
a) first, I wonder how surprising is this result? Many
biological processes possess an inherent rhythmicity (circadian
rhythms, gait, likely any muscular movement, etc…), owing to
many functional constraints and having multiple benefits (e.g.,
improved perception due to attention, synchronization with day
length, etc.) – as the authors explain in the introduction.
Lacking surprise obviously does not affect scientific quality –
but it might affect the focus of the presentation, which might
be more on the quantification of the rhythm’s frequency and its
variation. I believe that the paper would benefit if the
authors compared the rhythm they found in bat vocalizations to
the rhythm in other animals – where are similarities and
differences, and are there functional reasons for this?
We agree with the reviewer that the results were only partly surprising. The
finding that vocalizations align to any particular rhythm was not surprising,
since a coupling to other biological functions or brain wave rhythms can
probably be found for everything. The consistency of detected rhythms was
surprising, however. All species for which comparable data are available show
rhythms with individual differences, most likely to facilitate individual
discrimination. However, there are not many studies yet, so maybe our results
will not prove to be an exception after all. We added this argument to the
discussion (lines 275-279).
b) Regarding this quantification, the authors show that a
random sample of call and gap durations fits the isochronous
frequency worse than the real calls, confirming that the calls
are more rhythmic than by chance. I believe though that the
paper would benefit if the authors could not only show that
there is a rhythm, but could additionally quantify how well
this isochronous frequency matches the real sequence. For
example, when looking at Fig. 1B (territorial song example) it
is clear that the rhythm in the vocalization is not
isochronous, but changes over time: calls are emitted at a
higher rate at the start than at the end (as call duration also
changes).
Would it be possible to use the (frequency-corrected) temporal
deviation ((F)RMSD to evaluate and discuss the precision?
We agree that element (“call”) durations change, but gap durations also change
most of the time. Since this happens in a correlated fashion, inter-onset-
intervals (IOIs) stay roughly the same, resulting in an isochronous rhythm.
‘Isochronous’ does not mean that every pulse of the isochronous rhythm must
be matched by an element. Songs can change their tempo in a way that IOIs
double/quadruple or divide in half and the resulting isochronous rhythm stays
the same (Please see also the supplements: Validation analysis – Tempo
changes).
We made several attempts to use the FRMSD values directly to assess the
precision of a given rhythm. This proved to be more difficult than expected and
did not result in intuitively interpretable results. Therefore, we are convinced
that the current indirect assessments of the model calculations are appropriate
at present.
2) The authors argue that they found similar rhythms for all
three call types, and this notion is present throughout a large
part of the discussion. I think that this claim of similarity
is not well supported: the histogram in Fig. 3 clearly shows
that the frequency range 6-10 Hz is the dominant one in
echolocation, while this frequency range is almost not present
in the other two vocalization types. In contrast, in those two
types, the 10-20 Hz band dominates strongly; while in
echolocation, this band has only 0.4x the magnitude than the 6-
10 Hz band (and is not much larger than the subsequent
frequency bands after the prominent frequency band for the
other two vocalizations).
Playing the devil’s advocate, I think that the presented data
can equally well support the conclusion that the dominant
frequency bands DIFFER between echolocation and social
vocalizations. Whether this difference of a few Hz is regarded
as similar or dissimilar will also depend on what is considered
as a relevant biological difference – but this is not explained
and justified by the authors.
We think this similarity-dissimilarity argument is based on a misunderstanding
caused by an incomplete explanation on our side. Our analyses showed that
rhythm frequencies were most abundant between 6-10 Hz for echolocation call
sequences and between 10-20 Hz for territorial songs and isolation calls. Thus,
social communication signals showed rhythms twofold of echolocation call
sequences. Since many bat species produce one or two echolocation calls per
wingbeat in a search flight situation, expected echolocation rhythm frequencies
for S. bilineata lie between 6-24 Hz (wingbeat is 6-12 Hz; pers. communication
H-U Schnitzler). This frequency window overlaps almost completely with the
dominant frequencies found in the social vocalizations. Therefore we argue that
the latter are comparatively similar to echolocation call rhythms. We provide
more information in the revision to clarify our point of view (lines 292-298).
I believe that the manuscript would be stronger if:
a) the authors would put their results into a quantitative
context of what was found in other species. They currently
report that rhythms were found in other species, but not the
frequencies as well as the variation. This might help to argue
for a similarity.
Unfortunately, the current literature is severely limited regarding quantitative
comparisons of rhythm frequencies; individual variation is often not reported.
At present, we only know individual rhythm frequencies for male zebra finches:
individual frequency clusters lay between 10 and 60 Hz (Norton & Scharff,
2016). We mentioned this in the revision (line 51) but we refrained from
discussing this at length in the revision.
b) the authors should justify why they believe that the clear
difference in the histogram is not biologically relevant (if
the uphold their statement that the rhythms have similar
frequencies). Maybe some additional statistics or different
presentations of the results would also help: Classically, the
distributions or the mean/median of the (log-transformed)
rhythm frequency would be statistically compared to infer a
difference or not. In addition, I was wondering why a histogram
with a rather coarse resolution of 10 Hz was used, instead of
e.g. a violin plot including the raw data (Fig. 3). Likewise
for Fig 4 – I believe that a jittered scatter plot of the raw
data and it’s central tendency (plus maybe additional open
circle to show the clusters) would provide more information to
the reader about the underlying data.
We followed the reviewer’s advice and calculated violin plots (shown below).
However, we were not convinced that the information is transported better in
violin plots than in histograms.
Therefore, we would prefer to keep histograms in Figure 3, as we find them
more intuitive (line 226, lines 432-433). We adjusted the resolution of the 0-10
Hz bin to 6-10 Hz to better display low rhythms.
We adjusted Figure 4 according to the reviewer’s suggestions; it now includes
the raw data (lines 228, 230, 232, 235, lines 435-441). Due to the strong right
skewness of our data, mean and median do not represent the data well, which
is why tests using those as input were not deemed to be appropriate.
c) A main line in the argument of similarity is the
coupling of wingbeat and echolocation, and attentional
processes that are facilitated by a regular pattern (= allowing
the animal to assign attention to expected future events). This
is correct, but I am not yet convinced that wingbeat-
echolocation coupling is the underlying reason for a similar
(if it is similar) rhythm in communication calls. Crucially,
communication is likely phylogenetically older than
echolocation – i.e., bats and their ancestors will have
communicated with each other before taking to the air and
before echolocating. Arguably, the communication calls of those
ancestors will have had a rhythm to facilitate attention,
possibly coupled to theta-rhythms. After active flight and
echolocation have evolved, multiple scenarios might have
happened: i) echolocation and flight use a different frequency
band than communication (due to their own constraints, e.g.
breathing rhythm, muscle physiology, aerodynamics,
maneuverability,…); ii) E + F might use the same frequency band
as communication (e.g., to exploit existing attentional
processes); iii) or communication calls might have subsequently
changed their rhythm to those used by E + F.
I think the authors should consider those alternative
evolutionary scenarios; and not assume that the rhythm of
communication calls must be constrained by echolocation and
wing beat.
We thank the reviewer for this important thought. We included a paragraph in
the revision in which we explain the current opinion that flight preceded
echolocation, which indicates that vocal communication preceded echolocation
as well (lines 344-348). Correspondingly, we reworded relevant sections of the
discussion (lines 340-348) to downsize our claim that communication calls are
necessarily constrained by echolocation and wing beat. However, we still argue
that it is possible that social calls, despite being probably phylogenetically
older than echolocation, adopted the rhythm frequencies of echolocation calls
at some point (lines 346-348).
3) The introduction and discussion feel a bit lengthy to me,
and would benefit IMHO from some streamlining to reduce
redundancy and to focus on the main
points/hypotheses/predictions. Particularly in the discussion,
the text on wingbeat-echolocation coupling could be condensed.
I believe that the prediction (mentioned at the end of the
introduction) about individual differences in pulse frequencies
was not addressed again later.
Done. Both the discussion and introduction were adjusted according to the
reviewer’s comments and condensed as much as possible (Introduction: lines
40-44 and 69-76 were condensed; Discussion: lines 288-299 were condensed).
Best wishes,
Holger Goerlitz
DETAILED COMMENTS, in order of reading (numbers refer to line
numbers), ranging from the main comments above, over minor
points regarding details for clarification or improving IMHO
the readability, to style (which obviously is at the author’s
discretion).
20, and elsewhere: physically, a pulse is defined as a single
short event. In my opinion, it would be more correct to speak
of an “isochronous signal-derived pulse TRAIN” throughout the
manuscript.
We exchanged “isochronous signal-derived pulse” with “isochronous rhythm”
throughout the revision. Thus, we completely avoid the misleading word
“pulse”.
Additionally, I’m not sure whether it is relevant to highlight
this pulseS so strongly already in the second sentence of the
abstract. From my reading, the main point of the paper is to
having found a regular rhythm in three different vocalizations,
which is supported by two methods (pulseS, and FFT). It is not
clear to me why the authors highlight the (methodological
aspect of the) pulseS so much throughout the manuscript,
instead of the more general finding of the regular rhythm. (SEE
METHODS COMMENT ABOVE?)
We reworded the revision and exchanged “pulse” with “rhythm” to avoid
misunderstandings or confusion. That way the focus on “pulseS” is also
diminished.
Abstract, Introduction, and discussion: I personally am not a
big fan of motivating animal research with the understanding of
human traits, the benefits for humans, or other applications –
at least if this is not the prime purpose of the research.
IMHO, this eventually will lead to increasing devaluation of
animal research, and blue-sky research in general. While
language, musicality and its evolution are highly interesting
and also need to be addressed with animal models, I am not sure
if this paper benefits by motivating it by human musicality and
its evolution. This is not to diminish and criticize this work!
IMHO, it is very interesting to investigate the occurrence of
rhythmic activity in animals, its generality, its benefits and
evolutionary reasons. I believe the paper would become stronger
if its results would be linked more to existing research on
animal rhythms.
We generally agree with the reviewer. However, at present there are still so few
studies on animal rhythmicality that we cannot elaborate much on this
comparative aspect of our research. In the revision, we gave more details on
other studies about animal rhythmicality whenever possible. Moreover, we
reworded part of the introduction to shift the motivation for our study towards a
more general interest in rhythmicality (lines 49-68).
100-102: a wingbeat of 6-12 Hz is said to “correspond” to
echolocation call intervals of 10-20 Hz. To me, this appears
like a rather weak correspondence of rather different frequency
ranges (0.7 octaves difference!).
We reworded the passage and corrected wrong numbers. In search flight, one
or two echolocation calls might be uttered per wingbeat, which corresponds to
echolocation call intervals of 6 to 24 Hz (wingbeat frequencies of around 6-12
Hz) found in other studies on S. bilineata (lines 92-94).
103-104: the prediction here (“isochr pulses with freqs between
approx. 6-20 Hz”) contradicts the text in the abstract (“we
expected PulseS frequencies around 6-12 Hz”). Please correct,
and specify why one or the other prediction was made.
We corrected this mistake. The abstract now states that 6-24 Hz are predicted
(line 24). That was corrected in the introduction. The numbers result from
wingbeat data and IOI analysis in S. bilineata (lines 92-94).
105: than > that
Done (line 97).
117ff: “In isolation calls… call is the unit.”: These sentences
are partially redundant to the previous sentences. The first
sentence was likely intended to highlight that each element
within a single isolation call and song is the unit (in
contrast to echolocation, where the call is the unit, since it
has no sub-elements).
We omitted the redundancy (lines 107-109).
142: please state already here that only one echolocation
recording per individual was used (this information could then
possibly be omitted from later in the MS). Echolocation pulse
rate is strongly influenced by context and background
structure. Please briefly describe the release site (open, edge
space?) of the bats and if the recorded release echolocation
calls differ from search/commute calls under more natural
conditions. Why weren’t search/commute calls of free-flying
non-released bats used (I see that this cannot control for
individual identity, but still might give a more realistic
picture?).
We now provide the requested information already in at this point of the
methods section (lines 136-137). Calls of known individuals were recorded in
standardized release situations in relatively open space (e.g. on a forest
clearing). Recorded calls resembled normal search calls (see Knörnschild et al.
2012 for details), with the additional benefit of controlling for individual identity,
which is why we preferred release calls over calls from non-released bats. We
added this information in the revision (lines 132-134).
Some methodological details of the GAT approach are unclear to
me:
160: “because very few values…windows.”: To me, this statement
is unclear. Values = PulseS-frequencies?
Correct. In the revision, we use a clearer terminology (lines 151-152).
161: “For each pulse, we calculated the RMSD of all elements in
a vocalization from their nearest single pulse”. I think this
sentence is wrong – it starts by saying that something was done
for each pulse (=calculating the RMSD), and then concludes that
the RMSD was calculated for each vocalization to its (ONE)
nearest single pulse. I believe it should be: “for each pulseS
frequency / For each isochronous signal-derived pulse train
frequency / Or just: for each isochronous frequency,…”.
We corrected this mistake according to the reviewer’s suggestion (lines 153-
155).
162: It should be specified that the RMSD is the TEMPORAL
deviation between call onset and pulse onset.
Done (line 153).
163: “Pulses were offset to minimize the RMSD”. I see the need
for this and believe I understand, yet the description could be
more detailed. Was each element sequence tested for each
isochronous frequency at multiple temporal offsets? If yes,
what was the resolution of the offset (did it match the 0.01 Hz
resolution of the isochronous frequency?); and how much was it
offset (+/- half a phase?)?
The pulses were offset by up to one phase in 1ms steps (lines 154-155). This
was adapted one-to-one from Norton & Scharff 2016.
170: I was generally wondering why a clustering algorithm was
preferred for summarizing the isochronous frequencies, over
reporting mean/medians and variation measures of the (log(10)-
transformed) data?
We used a clustering algorithm since the data were strongly skewed to the
right; mean, median and corresponding variation measures did not give
meaningful insight into the data because of the skewness. We provide this
information in the revision (lines 165-166).
While the clusters in Fig. 4 give a great intuitive feeling for
the data, it is difficult to assess the frequency range
encompassed by a single cluster. For example, 70% of the rhythm
frequencies of pup # 22 cluster at about 16-17 Hz. What is not
clear from this plot, however, is how much the actual
frequencies within that cluster vary around 16-17 Hz.
Please indicate in the legend of Figure 4, whether the radius
or the area of the circle is scaled to the percentage of the
cluster (it should be the area, not the radius).
We followed the reviewer’s suggestion and changed Figure 4 to incorporate the
raw data; now it is possible to assess what frequency range is encompassed by
a single cluster. The area of circles is scaled to the size of clusters (lines 435-
441).
184: The phrase “we created two different types of artificial
vocalizations” set me on the wrong track, assuming that the
authors created artificial wav-files. I think more precise
would be “We created artificial temporal vocalization patterns
based on the previously measured element and gap durations”.
We reworded the sentences accordingly (lines 176-179).
For me, the model abbreviations (S and R) were initially a bit
odd, since it is not clear at first glance what the letters
stand for. Why not just 1 and 2? Or use full names, such as
“sequence-intact-model” and “sequence randomized model”?
We now use Model 1 and 2 throughout the revision.
194: “General statistics for modelled and original durations
were similar”. This is too short – which statistics are meant?
(And why would they be different, given that modelled durations
originate from the original ones?)
We omitted this confusing sentence. The statistics did not differ (since the
modelled durations originated from the original durations) but this information
is superfluous and not relevant for readers.
204: Why was such a coarse time resolution of 5 ms used for the
FFT analysis? The original time data (element on- and offset)
was likely measured at higher temporal resolution. I tried to
understand the potential implications of this - here are just
some thoughts: does this coarse resolution affect the precision
of the FFT-analysis? And isn’t this somehow at odds with the
very highly resolved PulseS analysis at steps of 0.01 Hz (= up
to 0.05 ms at 100 Hz)?
When calculating FFT, there is always a trade-off between time and frequency
resolution. We aimed for a frequency resolution of ~1 Hz. To get smaller bins
with a fixed frequency resolution of 1 Hz, we could have either decreased the
temporal resolution of the input signal or taken longer samples. Since we were
limited regarding the length of our samples, we had to decrease the temporal
resolution instead. We carefully checked whether we would lose elements with
a time resolution of 5ms, but this was not the case. We now provide this
information in the revision (lines 199-201).
Results, Isochronous pulses (225 ff)
I have some issues with the regularly occurring statement of
having found a similar rhythm across all three vocalizations –
see main comment above.
Fig. 3: The bar drawn at 0-10 Hz actually only contains
frequencies between 6-10 Hz. I know that it would look odd, but
it would be more precise if the bar was narrower to encompass
only this range. Alternatively, maybe another plot type might
visualize the data even better, such as a violin plot
containing the raw data and a (much finer) histogram? Is there
a reason for having chosen the rather large bar widths of 10
Hz?
As stated above, our analyses showed that rhythm frequencies were most
abundant between 6-10 Hz for echolocation call sequences and between 10-20
Hz for territorial songs and isolation calls. Thus, the best fitting rhythms were
comparatively similar across vocalization types (and vocalizing individuals),
with social communication signals showing rhythms twofold of echolocation
call sequences. Since many bat species produce one or two echolocation calls
per wingbeat in a search flight situation, expected echolocation rhythm
frequencies for S. bilineata lie between 6-24 Hz (wingbeat is 6-12 Hz; pers.
communication H-U Schnitzler). This frequency window overlaps almost
completely with the dominant frequencies found in the social vocalizations.
Therefore we argue that the latter are comparatively similar to echolocation call
rhythms. We provide more information in the revision to clarify our point of
view (lines 291-298).
We adjusted the histogram to incorporate your suggestions and visualize the
data better (line 226, lines 432-433). In the histograms, the bin width was
calculated by Rice’s rule, 10 Hz was a compromise between the bin widths
suggested by the formula and the need for depicting all three vocalizations in
the same way (Rice’s rule suggested a bin width of ~6 for EC, ~9 for TS and ~13
for IC). A much finer resolution was not possible since this would conceal the
interesting data clusters we found. Violin plots (see above) were not more
informative in our opinion.
Fig. 4 and L. 231 ff: I think it would be beneficial if the
authors marked those calls in Fig. 4 that cluster in the
frequency range they consider (6-20 Hz), i.e., the 19 (out of
25) isolation calls and the 8 (out of 14) songs. I found it
difficult to identify them myself, particularly for the song
calls. What was the criterion for saying that a cluster was
within the frequency range? For the isolation call, I would
have excluded 4-5 individuals (5, 11, 12, 13), maybe also #7
(because of two clusters, one inside, one outside the range).
However, if #2 is included, then the largest clusters listed in
the text would start at 20% (not 30%). Please add details of
the criteria.
We adjusted the figure according to the reviewer’s suggestions. In the new
Figure 4, data belonging to the largest cluster in the considered frequency
range (6-20 Hz) is marked in red (lines 435-441). The criteria for a cluster to be
considered were that the mean of a cluster fell into the range and the cluster
comprised at least 25% of data (lines 230-232).
For isolation calls, all IDs but 7,10,12,13,14 were considered to show a largest
cluster in the considered range (20 of 25 clusters). For territorial songs, IDs
1,3,4,6,7,8,9,10 and 14 were considered, which is 9 of 14 clusters. This
information was corrected throughout the revision.
256: “optimal pulse” seems awkward phrasing. “dominant
frequency” would be better; or other alternatives.
Done. “Pulse” was changed to “rhythm” throughout the revision; at some
points, we also used the phrase “dominant frequency”.
272-274: “Element onsets coincided … between 6-20 Hz…. DETAILED
ANALYSIS showed that…” This makes it sound as if two separate
analyses (a first general one, and a second detailed one) were
run – please rephrase. And see my thoughts about
similarity/difference of frequency bands across vocalizations.
We reworded this sentence to avoid confusion (line 269).
283: “surprisingly similar” – Why is this surprising? Which
difference would not be surprising? See main comments regarding
this topic.
We rephrased this sentence and omitted the misleading word “surprising” (line
273).
307-339: I found this part overly long and believe that it can
be condensed for clarity.
We would prefer to not condense this part since it is important for our similarity
argument. However, we streamlined it so that our intentions are conveyed
better (lines 291-319).
337: “the method at hand (GAT approach)” > “the GAT approach”
Done (line 325).
340 ff: “PulseS of echolocation call sequences … also fitted
best for social vocalizations”: see main comment on similarity
or not of frequencies, and the clear difference in the spectrum
between those call types (Fig 3, Fig S1)
As stated before, the best fitting rhythms were comparatively similar across
vocalization types (and vocalizing individuals), with social communication
signals showing rhythms twofold of echolocation call sequences. We now
emphasize this more clearly in the revision and rephrased the respective
sentence mentioned by the reviewer (lines 334-337 and 340-348).
Fig. 2 and 4: Shouldn’t RMSD and FRMSD have unit (s and s*s)?
And it’s a bit uncommon to have the x-axis at the top of Fig 2.
FRMSD has no unit (it is not s*s but s/s). The unit of RMSD is “s”; we added this
to the graphs. The position of the x-axis was chosen on purpose because we
find it easier to match the peaks of the graph to the y-axis like this.
References: The authors want to give the references are careful
read. There are a number of inconsistencies/errors, such as
capitalization or not of title words, missing italics and wrong
dashes in species names, or typos in title and journal (ref
42), missing journal (5) etc
In the revision, we omitted the errors in the reference list.
Reviewer #2:
The authors investigate the rhythmic nature of three different
vocalisation types produced by Saccopteryx billineata,
echolocation, song and isolation calls and find surprisingly
similar rhythms across the three. The study is well written and
brings across the major points in a nice and understandable
way. The analysis (within my area of expertise) is
scientifically sound and well performed, I am looking forward
to seeing the study published.
We are delighted that the reviewer liked our study and are confident that the
revised version has improved considerably.
Appendix B
We thank Dr. Görlitz for his time and helpful suggestions. The reviewers’
comment was greatly appreciated, and we have followed the suggestion.
Below, we describe in detail how we have revised the manuscript. Line
numbers refer to the revised manuscript. Changes in the revised manuscript
are highlighted.
Reviewer #1
I congratulate the authors to a well-done study and revision.
There is just one slight improvement I’d like to suggest for
the unit of FRMSD. Thanks for correcting me that FRMSD is unit-
less, calculated as RMSD (s) * frequency (1/s):
Frequency is the inverse of period: frequency = 1/period, so:
FRMSD = RMSD * 1/period = RMSD / period.
Thus, the value of FRMSD describes the average temporal
deviation as a fraction of the full cycle; a value of 0.13 for
the isolation call data means that the average deviation is
0.13 of a full cycle. I only realized this now and believe that
this would be relevant for the reader; a potential unit thus
could be “fraction of cycle” or “fraction of phase”. I think
this would help the reader a lot to interpret the meaning of
the FMRSD values, i.e., to understand that a FRMSD of 0.13
(original isolation calls) is not only less than 0.15 (model 1
of isolation calls), but also what it means in absolute terms
(= average temporal variation of 13% of a full cycle).
We thank the reviewer for this meaningful suggestion. We agree that the unit
“fraction of cycle” makes the concept of the FRMSD intuitively easier to
understand. We therefore added the unit in Figures 2 and 5. Furthermore we
strengthened this connotation in the method section (lines 159-160).
All the best,
Holger Goerlitz
