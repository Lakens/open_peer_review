Brief overview of manuscript
In the present manuscript the authors have studied several mutations in GJB2 encoding the gap
junction protein connexin 26 that are associated with the inflammatory skin dysplasia Keratitis
Ichthyosis Deafness syndrome – KID.
They suggest that the presence of the mutation evokes an internal splice site within the mRNA
that is not normally active and that this is linked with cell death. They further mutate 5’ and 3’
splice regions and identify a site that rescues the cytotoxicity and aberrant splicing. They also
show that one of the mutations alters hemichannel sensitivity in response to CO2. The authours
conclude that the aberrant splicing is due to the addition of mcherry as a marker, however they
do not in the discussion consider wider implications.
The work is well presented and aspects of the results clearly explained. However, I have several
major concerns about the scope of the manuscript, the interpretation of the data in line with
accumulated evidence in the field and recent literature on induction of alternative splicing linked
to cell stress responses. These concerns should be reviewed and indeed further experiments
warranted to relate the studies to the pathological mechanisms underlying KID syndrome.
Specific comments.
Introduction
The introduction is lacking some important information on the differences between the mutations
selected for study in terms of severity of disease. Cx26A88V is established to be associated with a
lethal form of KID syndrome along with the mutation Cx26G45E. Other mutations such as N14K
have been reported previously and are not discussed. A similar mutation in Cx30 A88V has also
recently been reported by Kelly et al (Journal of Cell Science 2019) where the lethality of this
mutation is also clearly presented. Thus some further introduction to current understanding of
the pathological nature of the KID mutations and the A88V locus should be included.
Methods
All the constructs used are fused in frame to the expression vector mCherry and others are in
untagged vectors. HeLa Ohio cells, that do not endogenously express connexins were used in all
the studies, thus the system is essentially assessing homomeric Connexin channel formation.
Transfections – cells are transiently transfected with the constructs and expression analysis
assessed 48 hours -72 hours post transfection at which time there is considerable over expression
of the introduced plasmids and build up of protein in intracellular stores.
Cell Death was monitored only by trypan blue exclusion assays, while more physiological assays
such as a MTT assay or WST-1 assay or apoptosis assay would seem more appropriate.
Statistical analysis is appropriate
Results/Discussion
1. The time point at which the assays are performed following transient transfection is quite late.
In the controls (WT and the A88S nonsyndromic mutation) there is a clear accumulation of
protein in intracellular stores by 48hrs. Was a time course on mRNA extraction performed.
Although A88V is not highly expressed the spatial localisation of N14K and A40V in these cell
lines is not reported. Indeed previous studies have clearly shown that N14K is trapped
intracellularly in the ER 24-48 hours post transfection in HeLa cells. Further assays clarifying if
the cell death phenotype/ ER accumulation is associated with the alternate splicing are required.
2. Figure 2 indicates the identified internal splice sites that are activated. However the selection of
the M151L mutation that rectifies this should be indicated on this figure for clarity. The
3
discussion should consider the implications of this on the overall folding and structure of the
protein.
3. The authors clearly identify that the introduction of the M151L mutation thereby removing the
5’splice site can rectify splicing. However, there is little comment on the spatial localisation of the
proteins. Indeed it looks as if the A88V protein still has trafficking issues and higher quality
images with co-staining with cellular markers (e.g. ER markers) wold help clarify this. This could
have important implications that are not discussed.
4. The cell death assays clearly show that the removal of the splice sites restore cell viability of
A88V. This is not the first mutation a A88V in a beta connexin that has been reported to cause cell
death in HeLa cells. A similar mutation in Cx30, associated with Clostron syndrome was
extensively studied in both HeLa cells, a cochlear cell line and a mouse model. In these studies,
and others similar effects of cell death were observed in both GFP tagged and un tagged proteins.
Further in the Kelly study mRNA levels of Cx30 in the mutant mice was significantly reduced
where they suggest that the mutation results in loss of stability of the mRNA. Indeed there are
extensive studies by this group and others that are not given recognition in this manuscript for
contributions to the molecular mechanisms underlying a range of Connexin channelopathies.
5. The CO2 and hemichannel assay for A40V is tagged onto the end when most of the work has
focused on the A88V mutations. It would seem more relevant to focus on A88V at this point
6. Furthermore, there is increasing literature to suggest that a number of mutations in b-
connexins result in altered association with connexin43, with which the beta connexins do not
normally oligomerise. It would therefore be worthy to take the A88V mutation and study the
splicing effect in the presence of other connexins, providing a more integrated approach to the
complex nature of connexin tissue expression profiles.
7. Finally, there is accumulating evidence that many of the connexin mutations induce ER stress
pathways or mitotic crisis points, recent reports in the literature also suggest that such events can
evoke alternative splicing pathways (eg Carew et al IJMS 2019). Therefore further studies should
systematically rule out if the alternative splicing is truly caused by the addition of a tag or if it is a
true reflection of the disease pathway.
Conclusion
While the manuscript has identified a novel pathway evoked in Hela cells expressing several KID
mutations the study is premature and requires consolidation to consider the merits of the
pathway in context with current literature.

The authors present here an interesting article that details a previously unknown phenomenon of
cryptic splice site activation in disease-causing Cx26 mutants in vitro, which can also act in trans
to cause the splicing of co-expressed wild-type Cx26. However, this feature is only evident in
cells expressing tagged Cx26 and therefore does not occur in vivo, or in cells expressing untagged
Cx26/mutants. The likely pathological mechanism in KID syndrome is related to the reduction of
hemichannel CO2 sensitivity which the authors have found across several KID mutants –
including now the A40V mutant in this study. The manuscript is well written, and the authors
have revealed a detrimental mechanism of tagged Cx26 mutants in vitro, which should be taken
into consideration for future research in the connexin field.
I only have the following minor corrections and considerations for the authors to address:
1) Insert the word “is” before “unavoidable” online 29 of abstract
2) What’s the scale of the Y axis in Fig.4, - is it percentage? If so, it should be written as such in the
axis label.
3) Splice is spelled as “spice” on page 11, line 7.
4) Is the untagged Cx26A88V mutant toxic to cells alone? It would also be interesting to see
additional data of untagged mutant in Figure 4.
5) It’s interesting that untagged input and reporter Cx26/mutants do not get spliced, whereas
tagged versions so. Therefore, I think it would be useful to see the untagged Cx26A88V and
untagged Cx26WT data in Fig. 6 rather than saying “(data not shown)”.
6) Although untagged Cx26 mutants lack the ability to undergo aberrant splicing (i.e. it only
occurs with tagged proteins in vitro), is there any evidence that the mutations could have an
affect on other connexins? We know that Cx30 is often expressed in the same cell types as Cx26
and it’s interesting that some mutations in Cx26 are mirrored in Cx30 in terms of their
location/substitution (such as A88V) and phenotype (skin disease and/or hearing loss). A recent
article by Kelly et al. (J. Cell Sci., 2019) found that the untagged Cx30 A88V mutant killed cells in
vitro, but not in vivo, and reduced both mRNA and protein expression of Cx30 in the cochleae of
Cx30A88V mutant mice. Have the authors have looked at this mechanism with other connexin
subtypes? Or could the authors comment on the possible trans effects across connexin subtypes?

Introduction
The introduction is lacking some important information on the differences between the mutations selected for study
n terms of severity of disease. Cx26A88V is established to be associated with a lethal form of KID syndrome along
with the mutation Cx26G45E. Other mutations such as N14K have been reported previously and are not discussed.
A similar mutation in Cx30 A88V has also recently been reported by Kelly et al (Journal of Cell Science 2019)
where the lethality of this mutation is also clearly presented. Thus some further introduction to current
understanding of the pathological nature of the KID mutations and the A88V locus should be included.
We have added greater explanation of KID syndrome mutations and references to the
introduction pp 3.
Methods
All the constructs used are fused in frame to the expression vector mCherry and others are in untagged vectors.
HeLa Ohio cells, that do not endogenously express connexins were used in all the studies, thus the system is
essentially assessing homomeric Connexin channel formation.
Transfections – cells are transiently transfected with the constructs and expression analysis assessed 48 hours -
72 hours post transfection at which time there is considerable over expression of the introduced plasmids and build
up of protein in intracellular stores.
Cell Death was monitored only by trypan blue exclusion assays, while more physiological assays such as a MTT
assay or WST-1 assay or apoptosis assay would seem more appropriate.
In our view the Trypan Blue assay quantifies cell death and is informative -it shows that it is
the splicing itself, but not the spliced product, that is the important factor in increasing cell
death. We do not see that we need to use another assay to document this point.
Statistical analysis is appropriate
Results/Discussion
1. The time point at which the assays are performed following transient transfection is quite late. In the
controls (WT and the A88S nonsyndromic mutation) there is a clear accumulation of protein in intracellular stores
by 48hrs. Was a time course on mRNA extraction performed. Although A88V is not highly expressed the spatial
ocalisation of N14K and A40V in these cell lines is not reported. Indeed previous studies have clearly shown that
N14K is trapped intracellularly in the ER 24-48 hours post transfection in HeLa cells. Further assays clarifying if
the cell death phenotype/ ER accumulation is associated with the alternate splicing are required.
mRNA analysis was performed at 48h post transfection. Our aim was to test for the presence
of the mRNA because expression levels of the mutant connexins were so poor. mRNA
extractions at different time points were not seen as informative in this regard. We performed
the assays at a time point when we know that functional Cx26 hemichannels (WT and mutant)
are present in the plasma membrane from our previous studies (including N14K/N14Y, de
Wolf et al 2016, Physiol Rep 4, e13038). Given that the toxic moiety seems to be the folded
mRNA and not the protein and the alternatively spliced product is non-functional, accumulation
in the ER seems a moot point to us.
2. Figure 2 indicates the identified internal splice sites that are activated. However the selection of the M151L
mutation that rectifies this should be indicated on this figure for clarity. The discussion should consider the
mplications of this on the overall folding and structure of the protein.
We have added a notation to the legend of Figure 2 that the highlighted codon at the 5’ splice
site is for Met151. We have added material to the discussion (pp 11). M151 is an outward
facing residue of the third transmembrane domain that interacts with the membrane lipids,
making it unlikely that there is a substantial change in channel conformation. WT Cx26 with
the conservative M151L mutation is still CO2 sensitive, still permeable to the fluorescent dye
and can still be blocked by extracellular Ca2+. By these measures the channels still retains the
major functions necessary for its role as a CO2 sensitive hemichannel.
3. The authors clearly identify that the introduction of the M151L mutation thereby removing the 5’splice site
can rectify splicing. However, there is little comment on the spatial localisation of the proteins. Indeed it looks as if
the A88V protein still has trafficking issues and higher quality images with co-staining with cellular markers (e.g.
ER markers) would help clarify this. This could have important implications that are not discussed.
This paper is about the splicing not about the trafficking. The M151L mutation rescues
expression minimizes cell death and allows functional hemichannels to enter the plasma
membrane. This is true also for A88V which exhibits CO2 insensitive hemichannels, an
observation that we did not include in this paper as we had already documented this
previously.
4. The cell death assays clearly show that the removal of the splice sites restore cell viability of A88V. This
s not the first mutation a A88V in a beta connexin that has been reported to cause cell death in HeLa cells. A
similar mutation in Cx30, associated with Clostron syndrome was extensively studied in both HeLa cells, a cochlear
cell line and a mouse model. In these studies, and others similar effects of cell death were observed in both GFP
tagged and un tagged proteins. Further in the Kelly study mRNA levels of Cx30 in the mutant mice was significantly
reduced where they suggest that the mutation results in loss of stability of the mRNA. Indeed there are extensive
studies by this group and others that are not given recognition in this manuscript for contributions to the molecular
mechanisms underlying a range of Connexin channelopathies.
This is a different connexin with a very different C-terminal tail. The relevance of this work is
not immediately obvious to our work on Cx26, but we have made reference to this with brief
discussion on pp 8. As mentioned earlier we have included a more comprehensive section in
the introduction on mutations and channelopathies relevant to Cx26 (pp 3).
5. The CO2 and hemichannel assay for A40V is tagged onto the end when most of the work has focused on
the A88V mutations. It would seem more relevant to focus on A88V at this point
We have already published the CO2 insensitivity of A88V, we chose A40V to extend
knowledge of the effects of KID syndrome mutations.
6. Furthermore, there is increasing literature to suggest that a number of mutations in b-connexins result in
altered association with connexin43, with which the beta connexins do not normally oligomerise. It would therefore
be worthy to take the A88V mutation and study the splicing effect in the presence of other connexins, providing a
more integrated approach to the complex nature of connexin tissue expression profiles.
This is beyond the scope of what we are reporting in this paper. We also point out that the
alternatively spliced product has an altered membrane topology (C-terminus now extracellular)
so is very likely non-functional (pp11, “The nature of the toxic moiety and the trans dominance
of the alternative splicing”).
7. Finally, there is accumulating evidence that many of the connexin mutations induce ER stress pathways
or mitotic crisis points, recent reports in the literature also suggest that such events can evoke alternative splicing
pathways (eg Carew et al IJMS 2019). Therefore further studies should systematically rule out if the alternative
splicing is truly caused by the addition of a tag or if it is a true reflection of the disease pathway.
We think there is little doubt that the alternate splicing is caused by the addition of the tag. Our
additional data in Figure 6 makes this very clear (see Fig 6C and D -where there is no tag
there is no splicing).
However, it is a very interesting question as to whether this could occur in the human disease
pathway. It is entirely possible that the non-coding sequences of the mRNA (missing from our
expression constructs) could cause the splicing to occur for the KID syndrome mutations. We
discuss this in the paper. The best and most direct way to answer this question would be to
extract mRNA from human KID syndrome patients. We think this is an important issue to be
settled by others with access to relevant fresh tissue samples and our paper may provide
sufficient motivation for them to do this.
Conclusion
While the manuscript has identified a novel pathway evoked in Hela cells expressing several KID mutations the
study is premature and requires consolidation to consider the merits of the pathway in context with current literature.
We disagree that our study is premature. We have been very open about the limits of our
study, and whether this is pathophysiologically relevant. We think this is an interesting cellular
phenomenon that we discovered by chance. It is worth reporting as many investigators in the
field still tag their mutant connexins with a fluorescent protein. Our paper will assist them to
design their experimental approaches to achieve better cellular expression and avoid a
potentially artefactual confounding factor.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors present here an interesting article that details a previously unknown phenomenon of cryptic splice site
activation in disease-causing Cx26 mutants <i>in vitro</i>, which can also act in trans to cause the splicing of co-
expressed wild-type Cx26. However, this feature is only evident in cells expressing tagged Cx26 and therefore
does not occur in vivo, or in cells expressing untagged Cx26/mutants. The likely pathological mechanism in KID
syndrome is related to the reduction of hemichannel CO2 sensitivity which the authors have found across several
KID mutants – including now the A40V mutant in this study. The manuscript is well written, and the authors have
revealed a detrimental mechanism of tagged Cx26 mutants in vitro, which should be taken into consideration for
future research in the connexin field.
I only have the following minor corrections and considerations for the authors to address:
1) Insert the word “is” before “unavoidable” online 29 of abstract
This has been corrected
2) What’s the scale of the Y axis in Fig.4, - is it percentage? If so, it should be written as such in the axis
abel.
This is now clarified in the axis label -it is fold increase over mock-transfected control.
3) Splice is spelled as “spice” on page 11, line 7.
This has been corrected
4) Is the untagged Cx26A88V mutant toxic to cells alone? It would also be interesting to see additional data
of untagged mutant in Figure 4.
We have added these new data to Figure 4.
5) It’s interesting that untagged input and reporter Cx26/mutants do not get spliced, whereas tagged versions
so. Therefore, I think it would be useful to see the untagged Cx26A88V and untagged Cx26WT data in Fig. 6 rather
than saying “(data not shown)”.
We now show this result in a new version of Figure 6.
6) Although untagged Cx26 mutants lack the ability to undergo aberrant splicing (i.e. it only occurs with
tagged proteins in vitro), is there any evidence that the mutations could have an effect on other connexins? We
know that Cx30 is often expressed in the same cell types as Cx26 and it’s interesting that some mutations in Cx26
are mirrored in Cx30 in terms of their location/substitution (such as A88V) and phenotype (skin disease and/or
hearing loss). A recent article by Kelly et al. (J. Cell Sci., 2019) found that the untagged Cx30 A88V mutant killed
cells in vitro, but not in vivo, and reduced both mRNA and protein expression of Cx30 in the cochleae of Cx30A88V
mutant mice. Have the authors have looked at this mechanism with other connexin subtypes? Or could the authors
comment on the possible trans effects across connexin subtypes?
We have not looked at other connexin subtypes. Given this appears to be a mechanism that
depends very specifically on the mRNA sequence (A88V but not A88S triggers this) it may be
unlikely that different genes with different nucleotide sequences would display this, but of
course it might still occur. We have added some discussion of this on pp 12.
