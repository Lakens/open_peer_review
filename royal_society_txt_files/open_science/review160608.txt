This is a competently conducted and communicated dendrochronological fire-ecology analysis.
The key point of different to previous studies is the Pacific northwest temperate rainforest
context. The result highlights the importance of human ignitions in the prehistoric period that
interplay with climate. The paper would be improved if the Introduction were rewritten to set
up some specific hypotheses based on previous studies, especially the possible importance of
human ignitions, role of drought and the interplay of various climate modes. Many of these
hypotheses are implicit in the Discussion. The current Introduction is fairly unfocused. The
Discussion could be slightly expanded grapple with the debates about human agency and climate
and what this means for the future of these ecosystems and for fire management responses under
the increasing influence of climate change.

This paper reports on the relationship between climate and human influence on fire activity in a
wet coastal forest. Overall, I think the research presented here was well designed and the results
provide an important contribution to better understanding drivers of fire activity in the Pacific
Northwest. The research questions, methods and discussion were all clear and match well with
the results. I think there are a couple of aspects of the paper that need clarification and further
explanation.
3
First, the authors present results reporting on the relationship between fire activity and the
different vegetation types but there is little discussion of how ignitions might initiate fire activity
and fire spread differently/similarly across these vegetation types. It appears as though most of
the fire activity occurred close to habitation sites, habitation sites which all appear to be located in
or directly adjacent to zonal forests (Fig 1) – is it possible that these are confounding factors? Is it
possible that zonal forests are acting as an important control on fire activity, or the interaction
between zonal forests and preferential habitation sites? Perhaps people chose to inhabit sites that
were the easiest to burn - zonal forests? There is little discussion of the relationship between
habitation site and vegetation type, and while model selection suggests distance to habitation was
clearly the strongest explanatory variable I think the possible role between zonal forest and fire
frequency and zonal forest and habitation site needs to be further explained. How would human
and natural ignitions affect fire initiation and spread across these different vegetation types, some
waterlogged, others like zonal forests which were presumably drier. I think the relationship
between location of habitation sites and vegetation type needs to be more thoroughly discussed.
Second, I suggest adding a brief discussion of the assumptions/background related to the
explanatory variables related to human activity: distance to human settlement and distance to
shoreline. The strong relationship between fire frequency and distance to settlement is a key
result but there is little contextual discussion about how distance to settlement and associated
activity would influence fire frequency (or distance to shoreline). While this might be obvious
(more human ignitions near a settlement) I think a very brief explanation of what is known about
how Indigenous people used fire (in addition to lines 54-57) in and around coastal settlements
and these activities would promote fire frequency would be helpful, along with an estimate
(range) of population density for the Hecate Island settlements (presumably from references 6-7,
38).
Lastly, I think a truncated and simplified version of supplementary table S3-4 should be included
in the main manuscript text. This supplementary table is important but currently difficult to read
and understand. The relationship between aspect and vegetation type was identified as
important during model selection but the nature of the relationship between fire frequency and
these two explanatory variables is not well articulated in the supplementary table or main text.
I have a few more specific comments below.
Specific comments/questions:
Line 99 “…….south to 30-50 N….” and these high-pressure anomalies result in? (extended
periods of warm dry conditions… that promote fire spread?)
Line 154 “…persistent and dense populations…..” Please include some range or estimate of
population density from ref. 6-7, 38.
Line 324 What data is abandonment based on? Is there any likelihood that people returned to
Hecate Island in the last century in ways the archeological record fails to record?
Line 350-357 While drying of in years prior to a fire event is a logical mechanism for explaining
fire spread (precondition for fire) it is somewhat surprising that results suggest climatic
conditions such as ENSO occurred more common 6-9 and 13-17 yrs prior (lines 282-283). It is
difficult to understand how fuel drying would influence fire frequency many years later –
although perhaps this involves a more complicated interaction between fuel accumulation,
drying and the fuel profile as noted by the authors. Any more thoughts on the mechanisms at
work here? Examples from elsewhere?
4
Line 365 …but also associated with aspect and bog forest vegetation type (as reported in line
267)? Can you include discussion of these two other variables? What was the relationship
between aspect and fire frequency and bog forest vegetation type and fire frequency (it is difficult
to pull this out of Table S3-4).
Line 365-367 From Figure 3 it appears as though all zonal forests had frequent fires, and this is
where settlements seem to have been preferentially located. So could it be that zonal forests
allowed fire spread? It appears as though habitation site and zonal forests are heavily correlated
which might confound your results. Can you discuss the relationship between zonal forests and
habitation sites? This seems to be a possible area of weakness – inferring distance from settlement
when most fires occur in zonal forests, which is controlling fires, humans, veg type or both? What
are the fuel characteristics of zonal forests?
Line 386 – and, despite little knowledge of cultural burning practices, can you add some thoughts
on what the most likely reasons were for anthropogenic burning?

See Appendix A.
Dear Dr. Power,
Thank you for the very helpful comments on our manuscript "700 years of human-driven
and climate-influenced fire activity in a British Columbia coastal temperate rainforest."
We have made revisions to the manuscript based on the excellent suggestions from both
reviewers. Revisions include A) an improved and focused introduction, which outlines
hypotheses based on previous studies suggested by Reviewer 1 and B) changes to the
discussion surrounding the role of human agency and future of coastal temperate
rainforest ecosystems. We have also responded to excellent suggestions from Reviewer 2,
which include a revised figure 4 and an additional table outlining our final model
selection in the main text. We feel confident these changes have improved the manuscript
and we appreciate the opportunity to publish our manuscript in Royal Society Open
Science. Below we detail the changes we have made.
Re: Reviewer #1 (Comments to Author):
This is a competently conducted and communicated dendrochronological fire-ecology
analysis. The key point of different to previous studies is the Pacific northwest temperate
rainforest context. The result highlights the importance of human ignitions in the
prehistoric period that interplay with climate. The paper would be improved if the
Introduction were rewritten to set up some specific hypotheses based on previous studies,
especially the possible importance of human ignitions, role of drought and the interplay
of various climate modes. Many of these hypotheses are implicit in the Discussion. The
current Introduction is fairly unfocused. The Discussion could be slightly expanded
grapple with the debates about human agency and climate and what this means for the
future of these ecosystems and for fire management responses under the increasing
influence of climate change.
Thank you for your suggestions, we have refocused and rewritten much of the
introduction to reflect previous hypotheses of fire activity, the interplay of various
climate modes, and the role of drought and fire weather in coastal temperate rainforests.
We have included some specific changes here (lines 67-73, lines 107-114), but please see
our revised introduction in the main document (lines 48-121). We have also expanded the
discussion to include important comments on the debate between human agency and
climate (lines 336-342) and how these ecosystems may respond to future fire scenarios
(lines 370-377, lines 386-397).
New text, lines 67-73:
Low fire activity is assumed due to the presence of old growth forests [14], the lack of
fire adaptations in dominant conifer species [13], the decreased flammability of large-
diameter, moisture-laden surface fuels [1,3], and the absence of 20th century fire activity
[17]. There have been no reconstructions of historic fire activity with fire scarred trees in
these wet and dense forests and fires are hypothesized to be large, stand-replacing events
occurring during unusually dry years when low fuel moisture promotes rapid fire spread
[2,13].
New text, lines 107-114:
In this study, we overcome the limitations of past studies by reconstructing the fire
history of a coastal island with extremely low rates of lightning and a short summer dry
season. Indigenous peoples abandoned the island more than 100 years ago and it never
had Euro-American settlement, logging, grazing, or fire suppression [31,32]. We
hypothesize that if Indigenous people frequently used fire, the fire history record would
be temporally and spatially associated with former habitation sites at decadal intervals
and absent in the 20th century. If Indigenous people rarely used fire, fire would be
consistently rare, occurring at centennial and millennial intervals and mostly explained by
topographic and climatic controls.
New text, lines 336-342:
Unlike many regions of British Columbia that experienced widespread fire suppression in
the 20th century, there are no known records of ignitions or suppressions in this remote
coastal temperate rainforest during the 20th century, and very few in the entire coastal
temperate rainforest as a whole [15,62]. However, several cycles of in-phase climate
oscillations resulting in warmer and drier conditions conducive to fire spread occurred in
the study area after the last recorded fire in 1893 (electronic supplementary material,
table S1).
New text, lines 370-377:
We also found no difference in the frequency of fire events across the four vegetation
types despite dissimilarities in fuel load, fuel availability, and potential flammability [21].
Although the effects of topography and vegetation on fire frequency were not readily
apparent, the variables aspect and bog forest vegetation type were included in our final
model selection (based on weighted probabilities) along with distance to former
habitation site (table 1b). These variables may imply other potential relationships
between the spatial patterns of fire, vegetation and humans such as the influence of
prevailing summer winds, natural fuel breaks, and territorial boundaries.
New text, lines 386-397:
In these very wet forests, centuries of repeat burning surrounding habitation sites may
have affected fuel loads, seral stages, and the abundance and distribution of flammable
vegetation [1,2,24). Because biomass is not limited in coastal temperate rainforests,
humans can exert control over natural conditions that promote or reduce limits on fire
activity. Therefore, human drivers and their ecosystem effects are likely more
pronounced relative to long-term climate in these very wet ecosystems [1,2,4]. As climate
change continues to promote prolonged warm and dry conditions and human footprints
expand [8], fires in these ignition-limited systems may occur again, but have the potential
to become large and uncontrollable [1,2,4,8]. We propose that a greater understanding of
the cultural traditions of burning and their ecological effects would provide more insight
into human controls on historic fire activity and help assess vulnerabilities to future
human-fire-climate interactions [2].
Re: Reviewer #2 (Comments to Author):
This paper reports on the relationship between climate and human influence on fire
activity in a wet coastal forest. Overall, I think the research presented here was well
designed and the results provide an important contribution to better understanding
drivers of fire activity in the Pacific Northwest. The research questions, methods and
discussion were all clear and match well with the results. I think there are a couple of
aspects of the paper that need clarification and further explanation.
First, the authors present results reporting on the relationship between fire activity and
the different vegetation types but there is little discussion of how ignitions might initiate
fire activity and fire spread differently/similarly across these vegetation types.
Thank you for your excellent points. To clarify, we have expanded the methods and
discussion to include descriptions of fuel assemblages and potential flammability across
the four vegetation types (lines 144-147, lines 370-377) and how centuries of fire activity
may have affected plant community composition (lines 386-397).
New text, lines 144-147:
Zonal and bog forest vegetation types have closed canopies, larger diameter and more
vertical fuel structures that are blanketed by thick moss compared to bog woodland and
blanket bog vegetation types, which are more open, drier, and contain finer, more
flammable fuel assemblages [14,21].
New text, lines 370-377:
We also found no difference in the frequency of fire events across the four vegetation
types despite dissimilarities in fuel load, fuel availability, and potential flammability [21].
Although the effects of topography and vegetation on fire frequency were not readily
apparent, the variables aspect and bog forest vegetation type were included in our final
model selection (based on weighted probabilities) along with distance to former
habitation site (table 1b). These variables may imply other potential relationships
between the spatial patterns of fire, vegetation and humans such as the influence of
prevailing summer winds, natural fuel breaks, and territorial boundaries.
New text, lines 386-397:
In these very wet forests, centuries of repeat burning surrounding habitation sites may
have affected fuel loads, seral stages, and the abundance and distribution of flammable
vegetation [1,2,24). Because biomass is not limited in coastal temperate rainforests,
humans can exert control over natural conditions that promote or reduce limits on fire
activity. Therefore, human drivers and their ecosystem effects are likely more
pronounced relative to long-term climate in these very wet ecosystems [1,2,4]. As climate
change continues to promote prolonged warm and dry conditions and human footprints
expand [8], fires in these ignition-limited systems may occur again, but have the potential
to become large and uncontrollable [1,2,4,8]. We propose that a greater understanding of
the cultural traditions of burning and their ecological effects would provide more insight
into human controls on historic fire activity and help assess vulnerabilities to future
human-fire-climate interactions [2].
It appears as though most of the fire activity occurred close to habitation sites, habitation
sites which all appear to be located in or directly adjacent to zonal forests (Fig 1) – is it
possible that these are confounding factors?
You are correct in that the three former habitation sites are located in zonal forest
vegetation types. Vegetation in the study area is spatially controlled by topography and
drainage; therefore, zonal forests are almost exclusively located in nearshore areas on
steeper slopes with better drainage (see methods, study area for a description). There are
also low lying nearshore and coastal areas of Hecate Island that contain bog forest, bog
woodland and blanket bog vegetation types. Therefore, we decided to use distance to
shoreline as a predictor variable along with slope to test whether nearshore areas and their
topography explained fire activity. We found no collinearity issues (relationships)
between explanatory or response variables (electronic supplementary material table S3-
S4). Another important factor to consider is that habitation sites in the study area were
established millennia prior to the arrival of western redcedar and the species assemblages
that comprise present day zonal forests, which we have clarified in the methods (lines
154-158). Therefore, we are confident that zonal forest vegetation types and habitation
sites are not confounding factors.
New text, lines 154-158:
This evidence together with the presence of culturally modified trees and nearshore
features including shell middens, clam gardens, and fish traps confirm that Hecate Island
supported three year-round habitation sites that were consistently utilized throughout the
Holocene [31,32] and established millennia prior to rise of contemporary vegetation in
region [37].
Is it possible that zonal forests are acting as an important control on fire activity, or the
interaction between zonal forests and preferential habitation sites? Perhaps people
chose to inhabit sites that were the easiest to burn - zonal forests? There is little
discussion of the relationship between habitation site and vegetation type, and while
model selection suggests distance to habitation was clearly the strongest explanatory
variable I think the possible role between zonal forest and fire frequency and zonal forest
and habitation site needs to be further explained.
Please see our explanation above. We also clarify that in this region zonal forest
vegetation types contain fuel assemblages that have more biomass, but are actually less
flammable (see above and lines 144-147). This is because they remain saturated under a
dense canopy and are enveloped in fog even in warmer and drier summer months. With
regard to your suggestion that humans may have selected their habitation sites in more
flammable vegetation, we suggest that the opposite may have been true. If people
selected a more flammable vegetation type they would have lived near blanket bogs,
which are more open, have greater sun exposure, and contain flashier and smaller
diameter fuels (lines 144-147). Although it’s unclear why people chose to live in specific
locations thousands of years ago it likely had to do with several interacting environmental
and cultural factors.
How would human and natural ignitions affect fire initiation and spread across these
different vegetation types, some waterlogged, others like zonal forests which were
presumably drier. I think the relationship between location of habitation sites and
vegetation type needs to be more thoroughly discussed.
In the discussion (lines 367-370) we suggest that similar to other locations natural
ignitions are influenced by topographic variables such as aspect, slope, and elevation.
Lightning-ignited fires are usually associated with steep, south-facing slopes at higher
elevations and in this region would likely result in a patchy mosaic of burned and
unburned vegetation due to differences in fuel load and availability (see comments above
and lines 144-147). In a natural fire regime, nearshore environments at sea level are much
less likely to burn. We are about to submit a manuscript that examines how human and
natural ignitions would affect the temporal and spatial aspects of the fire regime and can
provide you a copy to read.
The largest fire in the study area occurred in 1893 and burned 90% of plots. This low and
mixed severity ground fire resulted in a mosaic of burned and unburned vegetation across
all fuel types and vegetation assemblages including water-logged peat bogs and standing
forests. In this region, zonal forests, bog forests, and bog woodlands contain deeper soils
which are blanketed under a thick layer of moss compared to minerotrophic blanket bogs
which contain mineral soils < 20 cm deep and dry out in a few weeks each summer.
New text, lines 367-370:
For example, in our analyses, we found that fire events were not spatially biased to
expected locations such as south-facing aspects [42], steep slopes [20], or rocky outcrops
at middle and high elevations [19], but were strongly associated with the locations of
former habitation sites (figure 3).
Second, I suggest adding a brief discussion of the assumptions/background related to the
explanatory variables related to human activity: distance to human settlement and
distance to shoreline. The strong relationship between fire frequency and distance to
settlement is a key result but there is little contextual discussion about how distance to
settlement and associated activity would influence fire frequency (or distance to
shoreline). While this might be obvious (more human ignitions near a settlement) I think
a very brief explanation of what is known about how Indigenous people used fire (in
addition to lines 54-57) in and around coastal settlements and these activities would
promote fire frequency would be helpful, along with an estimate (range) of population
density for the Hecate Island settlements (presumably from references 6-7, 38).
We have clarified in the discussion why Indigenous peoples may have used fire near
former habitation sites (see comments above and lines 383-391). We also added new text
to highlight other potential relationships between topography, vegetation, and humans
(lines 372-377). Because the three habitation sites were located at sea level, we thought it
was important to include distance to shoreline as a predictor variable in case fire events
were a nearshore phenomenon (see comments above). We were unable to include an
estimate for the range of population density for Hecate Island settlements. Therefore, we
adapted the text to reflect this (lines 154-158).
New text, lines 383-391:
Historically, low severity fires may have been intentionally set near habitation sites to
clear land in otherwise dense forests, harvest timber and promote important and
accessible food species such as berry producing shrubs and bracken fern (Pteridium
aquilinium), a fire follower species and an important starch in the diet of coastal
Indigenous peoples [9,61]. In these very wet forests, centuries of repeat burning
surrounding habitation sites may have affected fuel loads, seral stages, and the abundance
and distribution of flammable vegetation [1,2,24). Because biomass is not limited in
coastal temperate rainforests, humans can exert control over natural conditions that
promote or reduce limits on fire activity. Therefore, human drivers and their ecosystem
effects are likely more pronounced relative to long-term climate in these very wet
ecosystems [1,2,4].
New text, lines 372-377:
Although the effects of topography and vegetation on fire frequency were not readily
apparent, the variables aspect and bog forest vegetation type were included in our final
model selection (based on weighted probabilities) along with distance to former
habitation site (table 1b). These variables may suggest other potential relationships
between the spatial patterns of fire, vegetation, and humans such as the influence of
prevailing summer winds, natural fuel breaks, and territorial boundaries.
New text, lines 154-158:
This evidence together with the presence of culturally modified trees and nearshore
features including shell middens, clam gardens, and fish traps confirm that Hecate Island
supported three year-round habitation sites that were consistently utilized throughout the
Holocene [31,32] and established millennia prior to rise of contemporary vegetation in
region [37].
Lastly, I think a truncated and simplified version of supplementary table S3-4 should be
included in the main manuscript text. This supplementary table is important but currently
difficult to read and understand. The relationship between aspect and vegetation type
was identified as important during model selection but the nature of the relationship
between fire frequency and these two explanatory variables is not well articulated in the
supplementary table or main text.
We have included a truncated and simplified table of our final model selection in the
main manuscript (table 1, lines 622-626) and attempted to articulate the relationship
between aspect and vegetation type and why they were included in the final model
selection (lines 367-377). To clarify, although our model suggests that the variables
aspect and bog forest vegetation type play a role in predicting fire frequency relative to
other variables, the model clearly suggests that distance from former habitation site is the
strongest predictor variable based on probability weights and 95 % confidence intervals.
New text, lines 367-377:
For example, in our analyses, we found that fire events were not spatially biased to
expected locations such as south-facing aspects [42], steep slopes [20], or rocky outcrops
at middle and high elevations [19], but were strongly associated with the locations of
former habitation sites (figure 3). We also found no difference in the frequency of fire
events across the four vegetation types despite dissimilarities in fuel load, fuel
availability, and potential flammability [21]. Although the effects of topography and
vegetation on fire frequency were not readily apparent, the variables aspect and bog
forest vegetation type were included in our final model selection (based on weighted
probabilities) along with distance to former habitation site (table 1b). These variables
may suggest other potential relationships between the spatial patterns of fire, vegetation,
and humans such as the influence of prevailing summer winds, natural fuel breaks, and
territorial boundaries.
I have a few more specific comments below.
Specific comments/questions:
Line 99 “…….south to 30-50 N….” and these high-pressure anomalies result
in? (extended periods of warm dry conditions… that promote fire spread?)
New text, lines 99-102:
In Western Canada and Southeast Alaska, large fire incidents have been linked to the
negative phase of the AO when high-pressure anomalies centered over the Arctic extend
south to 30-50° N and result in warmer and drier conditions that are more conducive to
fire initiation and spread [29].
Line 154 “…persistent and dense populations…..” Please include some range or
estimate of population density from ref. 6-7, 38.
There are no accurate records of population density and we have changed this statement
in the main text (see above, lines 154-158).
Line 324 What data is abandonment based on?
Our abandonment data is based on archaeological records and radiocarbon dates from
midden sites, early documents of smallpox epidemics, and the relocation of Indigenous
peoples onto mainland reservations. We have added new text (lines 158-160) and two
new references to clarify this.
New text, lines 158-160:
Although Indigenous groups continue to the use the study area for seasonal resource
gathering, habitation sites have not been occupied since the late 19th century coinciding
with two smallpox epidemics and the relocation of people to government-imposed
reservations [37-39].
New references:

Press, Berkeley, CA, USA.
Is there any likelihood that people returned to Hecate Island in the last century in ways
the archeological record fails to record?
Indigenous groups did return to the island to visit, bark strip trees, hand log, and pick
berries, but there are no records of reoccupation of former habitation sites or any fire
ignitions on Hecate Island. This has been confirmed with families that have long standing
territorial claims to the study area.
Line 350-357 While drying of in years prior to a fire event is a logical mechanism for
explaining fire spread (precondition for fire) it is somewhat surprising that results
suggest climatic conditions such as ENSO occurred more common 6-9 and 13-17 yrs
prior (lines 282-283). It is difficult to understand how fuel drying would influence fire
frequency many years later – although perhaps this involves a more complicated
interaction between fuel accumulation, drying and the fuel profile as noted by the
authors. Any more thoughts on the mechanisms at work here? Examples from elsewhere?
We are also perplexed by the fuel profiles and characteristics in this region.
Unfortunately there has been no contemporary fire histories conducted in high latitude
coastal temperate rainforests. Similar, albeit less pronounced lags have been reported in
coastal temperate rainforests located in the Olympic Peninsula, WA by Gedalof et al.
[23], but high latitude regions can have up to twice the amount of annual precipitation of
southern latitude coastal temperate rainforests. In these wetter forests, relationships likely
exist between large-scale climate oscillations and rates of evapotranspiration and fog,
which may affect the available fuel profile. In most forest ecosystems, fuels are reset
(saturated) each year during the rainy season, but persistent drought in the study area may
play a role in patterns of fine fuel accumulation, relative humidity, and foliar moisture.
Line 365 …but also associated with aspect and bog forest vegetation type (as reported in
line 267)? Can you include discussion of these two other variables? What was the
relationship between aspect and fire frequency and bog forest vegetation type and fire
frequency (it is difficult to pull this out of Table S3-4).
Please see comments above and lines 367-377 for a discussion on these predictor
variables.
Line 365-367 From Figure 3 it appears as though all zonal forests had frequent fires, and
this is where settlements seem to have been preferentially located. So could it be that
zonal forests allowed fire spread? It appears as though habitation site and zonal forests
are heavily correlated which might confound your results. Can you discuss the
relationship between zonal forests and habitation sites? This seems to be a possible area
of weakness – inferring distance from settlement when most fires occur in zonal forests,
which is controlling fires, humans, veg type or both? What are the fuel characteristics of
zonal forests?
We have clarified these statements above and in the text (lines 144-147 and lines 154-
158).
Line 386 – and, despite little knowledge of cultural burning practices, can you add some
thoughts on what the most likely reasons were for anthropogenic burning?
Please see comments above and in the main text (lines 383-397).
