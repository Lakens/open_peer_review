Though I am not an expert in the area of in silico studies (and hence in my opinion this work
should be verified by an appropriate expert) and a similar approach has been reported earlier (see
ref 25) however, overall, I found this work is an interesting one. I therefore support publication of
this work after some revision / clarification as listed here
1) The compounds synthesized are not well characterized, for example 13CNMR data and copies
of spectra are missing for most of the compounds (except compound 1e). Some of the 1HNMR
spectra contain solvent peaks, e.g. EtOAc.
2) No reference compound or standard drug has been used in any of the pharmacological assay
and the data not compared, why? It is therefore not possible to assess if the synthesized
compounds are less or more potent.
3) Table 3: ± S.D. values are missing for IC50 values, how many times these experiments were
performed?
4) Fig 8A: the Compound 1e did not show cytotoxicity except at concentrations of 100 ug/mL,
what about other concentrations above 10 ug/mL. Also what is the significance of inverted bars
observed at 0.1, 1 and 10 ug/mL? Fig 8B, error bars are too high.

1. A more detailed description of the CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) should be given,
especially it should be emphasized, whether there exists a crystal structure of it, and what its
biochemical properties are, since as it is written in the current version of the manuscript it is not
completely clear, if the crystal structure of the CXCR2 is known, and if a more comprehensive
information concerning its geometry, configuration and conformation are available.
2. It should be explained based on what the HEK293 and NCI-H1299 cells were incubated for the
certain period of time. If the information concerning the incubation of those type of cells were not
obtained from the results of their own experiments (conducted in their laboratory), and were
instead obtained from the literature then the reference should be given.
3. The toxicological properties of the scaffolds and the final structures of the novel agents should
be studied and discussed, since there are certain functional parts (functional groups) such as
triazole lookalike and sulfo functional group attached to other functional groups, which from the
toxicological point of view could cause unfavourable adverse and toxic effects, where the
cytotoxicity is not a sufficient information.
4. It should be explained why there are differences if different functional groups are added to the
scaffold, and which among those functional groups accelerate and which reduce the effectiveness
and rate of reaction of a certain structure, based on their chemical properties.
5. More or less only a very brief report concerning the results obtained in the current study is
represented in the manuscript at the current stage, without any detailed discussion.

Dear Editor,
Re: Manuscript ID RSOS-180176 (“Ligand-based Pharmacophore Model for the
discovery of Novel CXCR2 Antagonists as Anti-cancer Metastatic Agents”)
Thank you very much for your e-mail dated March 06, 2018 regarding the above
manuscript (RSOS-180176). We highly appreciate your decision that our manuscript
label_version_2
RSOS-180176 would be revised for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
According to your request, we have made corresponding changes to the manuscript to
address all the concerns of the referees in full and would like to submit a revised version
of the above manuscript. The original manuscript has been revised according to the
comments of the referees and by taking into consideration the items as mentioned in
your e-mail. We now upload the electronic files of the revised version for production,
together with a DOC file showing the changes made to the original manuscript (see the
parts marked in yellow). A detailed list of our responses to the referee’s comments on
the original manuscript, along with the changes made to the original manuscript, is
attached to this letter.
Among significant additions to the original manuscript are the followings:
i) The 13C NMR data and and copies of spectra of some compounds have been added
to the support information.
ii) The structure of SX682 was disclosed, Figure 1 has been revised.
iii) A more detailed description of CXCR2 protein has been added to the Introduction
part.
iv) The standard drug and SEM values of bioactivity test have been added to Table 3.
v) The explanation of introducing the functional groups (e.g. cyano group, sulphonyl
group) has been added to the 4.5 session of the article.
vi) More discussion has been added to the manuscript.
Thank you for your time and attentions. We would highly appreciate it if you could
convey my sincere thanks to the referees for their valuable suggestions.

Our Responses to the Comments of Referees
Comments of Referee 1
i) The compounds synthesized are not well characterized, for example 13CNMR data
and copies of spectra are missing for most of the compounds (except compound 1e).
Some of the 1HNMR spectra contain solvent peaks, e.g. EtOAc.
Our response:
We appreciate the referee for bringing this issue to our attention. It’s our negligence and
we are sorry about this. According to your comment, the 13C NMR data of compound
3, 1b and 1d were supplemented, but the 13C NMR data of compound 2,1a and 1c can’t
be supplied because of the lack of quantity, the structure of compound 2, 1a and 1c have
been verified through 1H NMR and MS. Although some of the 1H NMR spectra contain
solvent peaks, the purity of compound is enough to perform biological test.
ii) No reference compound or standard drug has been used in any of the
pharmacological assay and the data not compared, why? It is therefore not possible to
assess if the synthesized compounds are less or more potent.
Our response:
We appreciate the referee for bringing this issue to our attention. In fact, CXCR2
antagonist MK7123 was used as standard drug during in vitro activity test, the activity
has been added in Table 3.
iii) Table 3: ± S.D. values are missing for IC50 values, how many times these
experiments were performed?
Our response:
We appreciate the referee for bringing this issue to our attention. All of the antagonistic
activity assays were repeated three times, the SEM values have been added in Table 3.
iv) Fig 8A: the Compound 1e did not show cytotoxicity except at concentrations of 100
ug/mL, what about other concentrations above 10 ug/mL. Also what is the significance
of inverted bars observed at 0.1, 1 and 10 ug/mL? Fig 8B, error bars are too high.
Our response:
We appreciate the referee for bringing this issue to our attention. The cytotoxicity assay
was performed to provide concentration setting basis for wound healing assay.
Compound at the concentration chosen for wound healing assay should not cause
massive cell death, otherwise the result of wound healing assay will be inaccurate.
Compound 1e displayed low cytotoxicity according to the result, we thought that there
is no need to test the concentrations between 10~100 µg/mL. For illustrating this clearly,
the y axis in Figure 8 (A) was changed to survival rate. In fact, the control group
displayed no migration inhibitory effect according to the result can be seen in Figure 8
(C), Figure 8 (B) has been revised.
Comments of Referee 2
i) A more detailed description of the CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) should be
given, especially it should be emphasized, whether there exists a crystal structure of it,
and what its biochemical properties are, since as it is written in the current version of
the manuscript it is not completely clear, if the crystal structure of the CXCR2 is known,
and if a more comprehensive information concerning its geometry, configuration and
conformation are available.
Our response:
We appreciate the referee for such valuable suggestions to improve the quality of our
article. The crystal structure of the CXCR2 is still remain unknown, so the
pharmacophore model will be more suitable to be applied to find novel CXCR2
antagonists. Detailed description of CXCR2 was added to the first paragraph.
ii) It should be explained based on what the HEK293 and NCI-H1299 cells were
incubated for the certain period of time. If the information concerning the incubation
of those type of cells were not obtained from the results of their own experiments
(conducted in their laboratory), and were instead obtained from the literature then the
reference should be given.
Our response:
We appreciate the referee for pointing out this issue. The information of biological tests
including the incubation time was obtained from our own experiments.
iii) The toxicological properties of the scaffolds and the final structures of the novel
agents should be studied and discussed, since there are certain functional parts
(functional groups) such as triazole lookalike and sulfo functional group attached to
other functional groups, which from the toxicological point of view could cause
unfavourable adverse and toxic effects, where the cytotoxicity is not a sufficient
information.
Our response:
We appreciate the referee for pointing out this issue. In fact, the cytotoxicity assay was
performed only to provide concentration setting basis for wound healing assay.
Compound at the concentration chosen for wound healing assay should not cause
massive cell death, otherwise the result of wound healing assay will be inaccurate. The
toxicological properties of the compound need systematic study, in vitro or in vivo,
which is in progress in our laboratory. Following optimization of the compound will be
reported in due course.
iv) It should be explained why there are differences if different functional groups are
added to the scaffold, and which among those functional groups accelerate and which
reduce the effectiveness and rate of reaction of a certain structure, based on their
chemical properties.
Our response:
We appreciate the referee for pointing out this issue. We thought that introducing
stronger electron-withdrawing groups to compounds may contribute stronger CXCR2
binding affinity. Related explanation has been added to the manuscript.
v) More or less only a very brief report concerning the results obtained in the current
study is represented in the manuscript at the current stage, without any detailed
discussion.
Our response:
We appreciate the referee for such valuable suggestion to improve the quality of our
article. The discussion has been added to some parts of the manuscript.
