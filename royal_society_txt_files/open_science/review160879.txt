This is an interesting study of responses of soybean cultivars to neighbours of different cultivars
of the same species, of a related species, or of a species from another genus in the same family.
Unfortunately, the claim that the results demonstrate identity neighbour recognition (assumed to
have taken place via belowground emission of chemical substances) is not substantiated. The
alternative explanation that the responses of the target plants to effects of size and shape of the
neighbouring plants has not been ruled out adequately.
Introduction
Acceptable review of kin recognition in plants. The sentence on line 80-84 dealing with ref 30 is a
bit misleading, as in that study only one old and one modern cultivar have been compared –
number of replicates 1. The application of kin theory in the hypotheses (lines 109-111) is a bit
tricky, as it assumes, that the seeds used for the next generation (crop) are a random subset of the
seeds collected in the full harvest. Usually, seeds meant to be sold for sowing have been
cultivated separately from the crop meant to be sold as food.
Material and Methods
Transformations: it is a bit surprising that only root-to-leaf allocation was transformed (line 193-
194), as usually biomass data are not homoscedastic either.
Please explain the meaning of the V2 and V3 stages.
Line 184 – 185. Does this mean, that the term replicates here refers to blocks in time, each
consisting of a number of replicates per treatment?
Lines 176, 185-187. It is unclear how plant height was measured. line 176 mentions internode
length, not number, while line 186 refers to plant total height. Actual values in the Results section
(8-9 cm) suggest that internode lengths are reported there.
Perhaps the authors should make explicit that they considered outcomes with p value just above
0.05 still as significant.
Results
It is a pity that the authors present only a very limited subset of the data collected. In most cases
only the ratios are mentioned and the actual sizes of roots, stems, leaves and plants are not. Wild
soy beans are mentioned to be smaller (weight? height?) than commercial soybean plants (line
260), but the data of the plants in this experiment are not presented. There is no information on
the size of the bean plants, it is not even clear whether they have been measured (height) or
harvested.
Discussion
The authors claim, that the plastic responses of the commercial soybean to neighbours are based
on genetic relatedness of the competing individual in the pot. While that is possible, they cannot
rule out the possibility, that the plants responded to differences in belowground rooting pattern
or density in the posts and to differences in aboveground conditions (notably shading and R/FR
ratio in radiation reflected by the neighbouring plant). The descriptions of G. soja suggest, that at
least the aboveground structure of the plants is different from that of G. max, and the same may
be assumed for P. vulgaris. Differences in root density may explain differences in ratios involving
root mass of the target plants, and the allocation shift toward stems in G. soja in the same pot as
G. max may be determined by differences in height between the plants, as G. soja is said to make
slender, weak, branching stems (line 292). The authors suggest (lines261-264), that in that case the
plants of G. soja should show complementary reductions of biomass in the competition with G.
max, but that is based on the assumption that G. soja plants respond in similar ways to shoot
height or root density of neighbours, which does not need to be the case. In short, the claim that
the authors have demonstrated ‘identity recognition responses following a gradient of genetic
3
relatedness’ (line 301) is insufficiently demonstrated. For one thing, the analysis of this gradient
relies on data for only one genotype per x-axis entry.
Line 287. ‘capability to respond aggressively’ sounds a bit anthropomorphic. A more factual
description using plant traits might be preferable – or how should we measure aggressiveness?
Details
The terms sub-species and inter-specific used throughout the manuscript for the treatments
involving another, wild species of Glycine, c.q. the legume Phaseolus vulgaris, are incorrect and
potentially confusing. In both cases interspecific relations are involved. The difference between
the cases might be indicated as intra- and intergeneric relations, if needed, or the authors might
simply work with the congeneric G. soja and the bean P. vulgaris.
The authors of the two species have not been indicated fully correctly on p 5; Merr. and Zucc. are
abbreviations:
Glycine max (L.) Merr.
Glycine soja Siebold & Zucc.
All tables: fixed effets should be fixed effects.
Captions of figs 2-4: ‘neighbor relatedness’ is too vague here, as the authors want to demonstrate
effects of different grades of relatedness. Figs 2 and 3 refer to the neighbor pair G. max / G. soja,
while fig. 4 refers to neighbours of a different genus.

Comments to the Author
This paper evaluate the phenotype plasticity of commercial soybean in response to same-, sub-
and other species competitors. The authors found the phenotypic response against sub- and other
species, but did not in same species. I think this study is potentially interesting. However, it has
some problems for the publication. The main problem with the paper is that it is not clear
whether observed plasticity were adaptive response against competition. Authors insist the
observed plasticity comes from results of more intense competition. However, classical theories
4
predict that the similar genotype more compete, because they may use similar resource and
space. Authors should argue carefully in this point.
Introduction
1) Please refer about sib-competition theory that the similar genotype more compete,
because they may use similar resource and space.
2) We are still discussing the contents of First paragraph, and it is not concluded.
3) In L-71, author referred the Karban et al., (2013). But Karban’s study did not investigate
direct interaction among plants as this study. There seems to be more suitable refer in Mallotus
japonicus study by Yamawo (2015).
4) Please, provide more clear hypothesis about plant responses. What prediction about
plant response.
Materials and methods
1) In L117, this study did not detect mechanism of identity recognition.
2) Please explain V3 in L 143.
Results
1) There are numerous confused points, because we did not understand the adaptive
significance in plasticity of plants.
2) We recommend the direct analyses about relationships between genetic distance and
intensity of response in plants or competition among plants. The analysis may provide the direct
evidence for your idea that identity recognition responses occurred following a gradient of
genetic relatedness rather than as a consequence of clear-cut signal that would indicate “related”
and “unrelated”.
Discussion
1) In L 241, author said “We found that competitive responses”. However, this study did
not deny sibling competition theory. Please discuss this point.
2) Please add the references in L247-252.
3) Please explain about adaptive significance of observed plasticity in plants with more
references.

re common in natural populations with more variation and older plants that have experienced
petitive interactions. In those cases it is common to find a few big plants and many small plants

e descriptions of G. soja suggest, that at least the aboveground structure of the plants is different
m that of G. max, and the same may be assumed for P. vulgaris.”
agree with the reviewer that there exist size and morphology differences among plants of the
et species, G. max and plants of G. soja and P. vulgaris. This is unavoidable when comparing inter-
cific interactions and cannot be ruled out entirely. We have however, taken significant steps to
imize the effects of any size and morphology differences and thus we strongly believe that the
ults presented in this study are not due to these differences but instead to the identity treatments.
ow we describe these steps and indicate where they can be found in the manuscript when

thods of ref 35 with root biomass as the dependent variable and stem or leaf biomass as co-

e authors claim, that the plastic responses of the commercial soybean to neighbours are based on
etic relatedness of the competing individual in the pot. While that is possible, they cannot rule out the
sibility, that the plants responded to differences in belowground rooting pattern or density in the
ts and to differences in aboveground conditions (notably shading and R/FR ratio in radiation reflected
he neighbouring plant).”
erences in aboveground conditions, shading and R:Fr: We conducted this study in young plants to
ure that we would detect differences due to neighbour identity before any significant
veground resource competition occurred. Therefore, we harvested the plants before any shading
urred. In addition, we measured the incoming (from the top) R:Fr at 3.5 and the reflected (from
ghbouring plant side) R:Fr at 3.0 umol/m2.s from wild soybean, 2.8 umol/m2.s from commercial
bean, and 2.7 umol/m2.s from white beans. These minor reductions in R:Fr from reflected light are

e allocation shift toward stems in G. soja in the same pot as G. max may be determined by differences
eight between the plants, as G. soja is said to make slender, weak, branching stems (line 292).”
is was the case however, the most common response to height differences is stem elongation
ch may or may not be accompanied by shifts in biomass allocation towards stems. In this study we
not observe any changes in stem elongation suggesting that the observed response is not due to a
cue caused by height differences. We have added a mention to this point in the discussion, lines
-314.
