This paper reports on carefully devised route-choice experiments of pedestrians selecting one of
two to four exits for their egress from rooms of different geometries. Based on the experiments, a
simple choice model in form of a discriminant function has been proposed and tested by
simulation runs with a simple two-dimensional microscopic pedestrian model. The authors
conclude that the criteria for choosing the exit are just the shortest remaining distance, or a linear
combination of the distance and the local density in the region near the exit. The results are
convincing, and I only have a few remarks:
(1) Experiment B: In Fig. 6, I observe a discrepancy of the last-exit times of up to 15% (between
the circled and the squared exits of Run 2), and also a significant difference between exits of the
same symmetry class (circled exits in Run 3). This discrepancy I would not call "load balancing".
Please discuss.
(2) Experiment C: It is stated that the pedestrians do not know the number or location of the exits
beforehand. However, this implies that different persons have been used for the three runs. I
wonder if this is true (at least for the first two runs) and, if not, if any "learning effects have been
observed.
(3) The discriminant analysis for the exit choice is presented for two exits ("negative discriminants
correspond to the choice of the first exit"). However, Experiment B has 4 exits and I wonder how
this method is generalized for this case. Furthermore, I wonder if a binomial or multinomial logit
model (MNL) (Experiments A,C, or B, respectively) will lead to significantly different results, and
also which model has a higher predictive power. Notice that the MNL not only gives the
preferred exit but also the probability to chose it. In fact, the simplified model in 4(b) has the form
of a deterministic utility V_i of discrete-choice models, so a formal maximum likelihood
calibration would be useful (this will result in -V_i=delta* \tilde{d}_i + delta*gamma \tilde{rho}_i
with the weighting gamma of the order beta/alpha and 1/delta determining the discrimination
uncertainty in fractions of d_max).
(3a) Since the definition of the area in front of the exit to calculate the density is somewhat
arbitrary (there is no further discriminating effect if the area covered by the waiting people is
larger than (or has a different shape as) the predefined area. I expect that the number of waiting
people divided by the width of the exit (i.e., a sort of one-dimensional density) is a variable of
more explanatory power than the 2d density. Basically, the former quantity is proportional to the
egress time of the presently waiting people which is exactly what I would like to know when
determining exits. Moreover, it is easier for pedestrians to count people than to estimate 2d
densities.

In this manuscript, the authors investigate how crowds of people choose an exit out a building
during collective evacuations. The work relies on a nice combination of experimental and
modelling/simulations methods. The authors show the existence of a ‘load balance’ phenomenon
that is consistently observed across experimental conditions.
I found that the manuscript is clear, well-written, and brings in interesting insights about crowd
behaviour. The model is simple and efficiently reproduces observed patterns. The load balance is
an interesting insight, in particular given the consistency of the phenomenon across
environmental topologies. I would even recommend using the keyword ‘load balance’ directly in
the title of the manuscript.
Overall, this is a very good paper. I just have a few minor comments:
-Figures 2, 5 and 8: Please add the number of participants as figure insets to facilitate the reading.
-Likewise, in figures 3, 6 and 9, it might be useful to color-code the dots to indicate the crowd
density.
-Figure 6: Why did the authors choose to group the exits 1 and 2, rather than exits 2 and 3. In fact,
exits 2 and 3 are similar in the sense where these are the two exits that are closed to the
participants starting position, whereas 1 and 4 and those that are farther away. Why then
grouping 1 and 2 for the presentation of the results?
-At first, I felt that the number of repetitions was too low. Nevertheless, the observed
phenomenon (load balance) consistently emerges across environmental conditions, which gives
some confidence about the fact that the observations are statistically reliable. Would the authors
like to comment on that point?
-At a higher level, I felt that one important point needs to be discussed: Participants in the
experiment managed to find a good tradeoff between minimising the distance of the exit and its
congestion level. However, this applies only when the individuals know for sure that all exits are
perfectly equivalent: All the exits are usable and lead outside the building. The only factors
influencing the choice are, thus, distance and congestion of each exit. In real evacuations,

however, there is an additional uncertainty about the reliability of the exits. Being unsure about
which exit is usable, where the danger is, and where the exits lead to are factors that produce
another important phenomenon: imitation and herding. Even in very simple situations like
getting out of a train stations, commuters who are not familiar with the place do only optimise
distance and congestion: they also tend to follow others because they are uncertain about which
is the right exit to use. In emergencies, this phenomenon has been studied in many papers,
including the seminal work by Helbing (in Nature, 2000) and a more recent work by Moussaïd et
al. (in Royal Society Interface, 2016).
I understand that this aspect is not in the scope of the present manuscript, but it is for sure a
feature of real evacuations. I believe that the authors should discuss this point in the paper, and
let the readers know that another process most likely comes on top of the one described here in
real evacuations.
Other than that, I liked the paper and think it deserves to be published.

Response to the referees
December 19, 2016
Dear referees,
your comments greatly contribute to improve our work. Many thanks for your careful reading
and understanding effort. Please find here the answer to each comment and the modifications done
to the paper.
Reviewer 1 This paper reports on carefully devised route-choice experiments of pedestrians se-
lecting one of two to four exits for their egress from rooms of different geometries. Based on the
experiments, a simple choice model in form of a discriminant function has been proposed and tested
by simulation runs with a simple two-dimensional microscopic pedestrian model. The authors con-
clude that the criteria for choosing the exit are just the shortest remaining distance, or a linear
combination of the distance and the local density in the region near the exit. The results are con-
vincing, and I only have a few remarks:
(1) Experiment B: In Fig. 6, I observe a discrepancy of the last-exit times of up to 15% (between
the circled and the squared exits of Run 2), and also a significant difference between exits of the
same symmetry class (circled exits in Run 3). This discrepancy I would not call ”load balancing”.
Please discuss.
Answer: Yes, a small discrepancy of around 2 s is observed for the evacuation time in the
experiment B. This times corresponds approximately to the time needed by a participant to go
from an exit to another (the exits are spaced of around 5 m). This characteristic shows that the
participants initially chose an exit and only changed for a freer one if the won time was bigger
than the time necessary to reach it. The discrepancy is due to the spacial configuration of the
experiment and to the initial configuration. Some precisions regarding this remark have been
added to the article (see the second paragraph of section 3(b)).
(2) Experiment C: It is stated that the pedestrians do not know the number or location of the
exits beforehand. However, this implies that different persons have been used for the three runs. I
wonder if this is true (at least for the first two runs) and, if not, if any ”learning effects have been
observed.
Answer: Effectively, the participants of the experiment C / run 3 already performed once this
configuration and a learning effect should not be excluded. This is the only experiment that the
participant performed twice. We specified this point in the article (see section 3 second paragraph
and section 3(c), first paragraph).
(3) The discriminant analysis for the exit choice is presented for two exits (”negative discrimi-
nants correspond to the choice of the first exit”). However, Experiment B has 4 exits and I wonder
how this method is generalized for this case.
Answer: In order to keep the model as simple as possible, we only simultaneously compared
two exits. In the experiment B, which had 4 exits, we had to separately consider the chosen exit to
one of the three others. The minimum operation used to select the exit is commutative. Therefore
this approach does not change the nature of the model (the chosen exit is the one minimising the
discriminant, independently to the number of possible exits). We specified this aspect in the article
at the end of the second paragraph of section 4(a).
Furthermore, I wonder if a binomial or multinomial logit model (MNL) (Experiments A,C, or B,
respectively) will lead to significantly different results, and also which model has a higher predictive
power. Notice that the MNL not only gives the preferred exit but also the probability to chose it.
Answer: In the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) we used, the parameters are estimated by
least squares. As mentioned in the paper, such procedure coincides with a maximum likelihood
estimation under homoscedasticity and multivariate normal distribution assumptions (see second
paragraph of section 4(a)). Yet that’s right, we could also implement a Logit which has less
assumption and is well-known to be robust. However we know that LDA often better classifies than
a logit when the assumptions holds (factor of around 1.5). Here even if we didn’t realize some tests
(that would probably not be supported since our observation number is important), we found that
the homoscedasticity and multivariate normal distribution assumptions where reasonable (with no
outliers and uni-modal shapes, see Fig. 11) and preferred to used a LDA instead of a logit. We
expect that the prediction error would have been lightly bigger with the logit but we didn’t test it.
In any case we believe that the results would not change a lot.
In fact, the simplified model in 4(b) has the form of a deterministic utility Vi of discrete-choice
models, so a formal maximum likelihood calibration would be useful (this will result in -Vi =
d * d˜i + d * <U+03B3> <U+03C1>~i with the weighting <U+03B3> of the order ß/a and 1/d determining the discrimination
uncertainty in fractions of dmax ).
Answer: The model is based on two threshold parameters, namely the maximal distance dmax
and the maximal density <U+03C1>max . Other linear combinations are possible in the model, leading
to other parameters with different interpretations. We found the suggested representation very
interesting, notably because it allows to evaluate the discrimination uncertainty. Yet we believe
that our description is easier to interpret and to also to apply. The maximal distance can be referred
to the geometry of the room and the horizon of consideration of a pedestrian, while the maximum
density threshold is a quantity currently estimated in traffic engineering. Therefore we preferred to
keep the description with the parameters dmax and <U+03C1>max .
(3a) Since the definition of the area in front of the exit to calculate the density is somewhat
arbitrary (there is no further discriminating effect if the area covered by the waiting people is larger
than (or has a different shape as) the predefined area. I expect that the number of waiting people
divided by the width of the exit (i.e., a sort of one-dimensional density) is a variable of more
explanatory power than the 2d density. Basically, the former quantity is proportional to the egress
time of the presently waiting people which is exactly what I would like to know when determining
exits. Moreover, it is easier for pedestrians to count people than to estimate 2d densities.
Answer: We used the density instead of the number of persons queuing because we believe that
it is easier to measure a density than the fact that someone is queuing. Determining that someone
is queuing (or waiting) requires to measure the speed that is a dynamic variable. Measuring the
density only requires to count some people in a predefined area. Notably and oppositely to the
queuing determination, measuring the density can be done instantaneously. Moreover there exit
in the literature many techniques to precisely measure the density (for instance Voronoi or kernel
methods) that are quite easy to use. However we agree, the width of the area where the density is
measured should depend on the width of the exit. In this case our method consists, as suggested,
to count people in front of the exit. Since the model is linear, dividing this number by the area of
the measurement to get a density, only change the estimation of the coefficient by a given factor.
Some specifications regarding this interesting comment are added to the article (see first paragraph
of section 4(a)).
Minor in Fig. 6: The circle symbols are smaller than the square symbols, so the first should
obscure the latter when there is an overlap, not the other way round. This will increase readability
Answer: That’s true. Thanks again for the careful reading. We reduced the size of the squares
in Figs. 6 and 13 and also used a partially translucent grey for the squares and the circles in Figs 3,
6, 9, 12, 13 and 14 so that we can guess the points even when they overlap.
Reviewer 2 In this manuscript, the authors investigate how crowds of people choose an exit out
a building during collective evacuations. The work relies on a nice combination of experimental
and modelling/simulations methods. The authors show the existence of a load balance phenomenon
that is consistently observed across experimental conditions. I found that the manuscript is clear,
well-written, and brings in interesting insights about crowd behaviour. The model is simple and
efficiently reproduces observed patterns. The load balance is an interesting insight, in particular
given the consistency of the phenomenon across environmental topologies. I would even recommend
using the keyword load balance directly in the title of the manuscript. Overall, this is a very good
paper. I just have a few minor comments:
-Figures 2, 5 and 8: Please add the number of participants as figure insets to facilitate the
reading.
Answer: We added the participants numbers for each experiment in Figs. 2, 5 and 8. We agree
this improves the readability. Thanks!
-Likewise, in figures 3, 6 and 9, it might be useful to color-code the dots to indicate the crowd
density.
Answer: We changed the color of the points in Figs. 3, 6, 9 and also 12, 13, 14 to a partially
translucent grey in order to improve the readability of overlapping points. We tried to index the
grey by the density but we found that such feature makes the figures harder to read. Therefore we
chose to keep the color level constant.
-Figure 6: Why did the authors choose to group the exits 1 and 2, rather than exits 2 and 3.
In fact, exits 2 and 3 are similar in the sense where these are the two exits that are closed to the
participants starting position, whereas 1 and 4 and those that are farther away. Why then grouping
1 and 2 for the presentation of the results?
Answer: We chose to arrange the exits in such a configuration because this allows to compare
the exits 1 and 4 and the exits 2 and 3. Such two groups of exits (1/4 and 2/3) have similar
characteristics. The group 1/4 are the farthest exits while the group 2/3 are the closest exits to the
initial positions. We had to group the exits 1 and 2 on the X axis and the exits 3 and 4 on the Y
one to get this comparison. Some precisions regarding this representation have been added to the
article (see the second paragraph of section 3(b)).
-At first, I felt that the number of repetitions was too low. Nevertheless, the observed phenomenon
(load balance) consistently emerges across environmental conditions, which gives some confidence
about the fact that the observations are statistically reliable. Would the authors like to comment on
that point?
Answer: This remark is interesting. Thanks for it. We specified in the introduction that this
balancing effect is a feature (i.e. something statistically sound) since it is observed in all the 16
experiments we carried out.
-At a higher level, I felt that one important point needs to be discussed: Participants in the
experiment managed to find a good trade-off between minimising the distance of the exit and its
congestion level. However, this applies only when the individuals know for sure that all exits are
perfectly equivalent: All the exits are usable and lead outside the building. The only factors influ-
encing the choice are, thus, distance and congestion of each exit. In real evacuations, however,
there is an additional uncertainty about the reliability of the exits. Being unsure about which exit
is usable, where the danger is, and where the exits lead to are factors that produce another impor-
tant phenomenon: imitation and herding. Even in very simple situations like getting out of a train
stations, commuters who are not familiar with the place do only optimise distance and congestion:
they also tend to follow others because they are uncertain about which is the right exit to use. In
emergencies, this phenomenon has been studied in many papers, including the seminal work by
Helbing (in Nature, 2000) and a more recent work by Moussad et al. (in Royal Society Interface,
2016). I understand that this aspect is not in the scope of the present manuscript, but it is for sure
a feature of real evacuations. I believe that the authors should discuss this point in the paper, and
let the readers know that another process most likely comes on top of the one described here in real
evacuations. Other than that, I liked the paper and think it deserves to be published.
Answer: That’s true, our approach is basic and remains in real application cases, notably for
calculation of evacuation time in emergency, to be completed by further processes and parameters.
Yet our objective is to find underlying mechanisms for the exit choice by using an approach as
parsimonious as possible. We specified our approach in the introduction (first paragraph), and
added in conclusion some possible extensions of the models to capture some other features. We
also added the mentioned references that completed our bibliographical review (see section 2).
