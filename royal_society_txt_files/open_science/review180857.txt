RSOS-180857 - Brain Structure Associated with Accuracy of Face Cognition – Global and Specific
Interindividual Differences in Cortical Thickness
1. The importance of the research question(s).
I think this research is important. There is strong behavioral evidence concerning the specificity
of face and emotion processing in humans. There is also decent biological evidence concerning
details of face and emotion processing. The interplay of both levels is somewhat less clearly
established – specifically when it comes to cortical thickness.
2. The logic, rationale, and plausibility of the proposed hypotheses.
The logic of the study is straightforward. If face-perception and face-recognition are distinct
abilities in the sense that they cannot be fully accounted for through other (established) abilities
and if it is true that there are specialized regions for face-processing, then better performance
should be associated with higher volume of specialized regions. The expectations are well
motivated, the available data are strong in terms of allowing a sound test of the predictions, and
the proposed analysis is well-suited to provide a strong conclusion.
3. The soundness and feasibility of the methodology and analysis pipeline (including statistical
power analysis where applicable).
The study is based on a reanalysis of outstanding data. Obviously, power considerations might
be deemed post hoc – but either way, given the large sample power is not a problem (unlike the
situation in the majority of MRI studies). I have more expertise for the behavioral side of the
study. The model proposed in figure 1 panel 2 stands a decent chance to fit the data (and better
than the model in panel 1). Are the df in the model reported in the manuscript correct?
3
Obviously, if the same does not apply to figure 2 panels 2 and 1 respectively, there is little point
in estimating the model in figure 3. Again, a nested factor for the behavioral side has been shown
repeatedly – and similar evidence is presented for cortical thickness.
4. Whether the clarity and degree of methodological detail would be sufficient to replicate the
proposed experimental procedures and analysis pipeline.
The procedure is really pretty clear. I am not an MRI expert but a quick search shows that there
are alternative and arguably competing methods to measure/calculate/estimate cortical
thickness. Here are some papers I found in a quick search:

based_cortical_thickness_measurements_in_MRI
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811916307637
The authors should add a paragraph or two clarifying these issues.
The control of sex and age on the latent variable was not completely clear to me. Wouldn’t it be
better to partial sex and age effects on the level of manifest variables and move on analyzing
residuals? At least for sex the sample size would permit estimating multiple group CFA – if that
were an interesting research question. Given the available literature on sex differences in face-
processing this might be the case.
5. Whether the authors provide a sufficiently clear and detailed description of the methods to
prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedures or analysis pipeline.
The method is sufficiently clear and detailed. The “researcher degrees of freedom” are very
limited. An independent team of researchers would be able to exactly replicate the models,
results, and inferences.
Although I am not an expert, it might be an option to specify localized tasks differently.
Currently the authors propose to classify tasks according to stimulus content. An alternative
could be to use only trials from 3.3.2.2 and ignore 3.3.2.1. I am not sure how decisive the nature of
face stimuli is for completion of 3.3.2.1. May be there is evidence I am not aware of that shows
that WM tasks with face content are face specific just like other face-tasks.
6. Whether the authors have considered sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. absence of
floor or ceiling effects; positive controls; other quality checks) for ensuring that the results
obtained are able to test the stated hypotheses.
Provided the available data allow specification of cortical thickness variables in non-face areas,
these could be used to confirm that face specific relations are found for face specific behavioral
and biological indicators but no such relationships can be found for non face specific data. This
might strengthen the point the authors like to make.

Comments to the Author:
Two reviewers (including one statistical expert) have now appraised the manuscript. Both
reviews are overall positive, but raise a number of specific issues that will be need to be
addressed in order to achieve IPA. Among the main concerns, Reviewer 1 notes several areas of
the statistical analysis where greater detail or justification is required (including, among other
points, methods to deal with dependent observations, and the reporting of the power analysis),
while Reviewer 2 asks for greater justification of the localizer tasks and suggestions for additional
control analyses. Please attend carefully to each point raised in the reviews.

Dear Ms Meyer
On behalf of the Editor, I am pleased to inform you that your Manuscript RSOS-180857.R1
entitled "Brain Structure Associated with Accuracy of Face Cognition – Global and Specific
Interindividual Differences in Cortical Thickness" has been accepted in principle for publication
in Royal Society Open Science. The reviewers' and editors' comments are included at the end of
this email.
You may now progress to Stage 2 and complete the study as approved. Before commencing data
collection we ask that you:
1) Update the journal office as to the anticipated completion date of your study.
2) Please register your approved protocol, unchanged from the currently accepted version, on the
Open Science Framework using the dedicated registration tool for RRs at the OSF
(https://osf.io/rr), either publicly or privately under embargo until submission of the Stage 2
manuscript. Please note that a time-stamped, independent registration of the protocol is required
under journal policy, and manuscripts that do not conform to this requirement cannot be
considered at Stage 2. The protocol should be registered unchanged from its current approved
state, with the time-stamp preceding implementation of the approved study design.
Following completion of your study, we invite you to resubmit your paper for peer review as a
Stage 2 Registered Report. Please note that your manuscript can still be rejected for publication at
Stage 2 if the Editors consider any of the following conditions to be met:
8
• The results were unable to test the authors’ proposed hypotheses by failing to meet the
approved outcome-neutral criteria.
• The authors altered the Introduction, rationale, or hypotheses, as approved in the Stage 1
submission.
• The authors failed to adhere closely to the registered experimental procedures. Please note that
any deviations from the approved experimental procedures must be communicated to the editor
immediately for approval, and prior to the completion of data collection. Failure to do so can
result in revocation of in-principle acceptance and rejection at Stage 2 (see complete guidelines for
further information).
• Any post-hoc (unregistered) analyses were either unjustified, insufficiently caveated, or overly
dominant in shaping the authors’ conclusions.
• The authors’ conclusions were not justified given the data obtained.
We encourage you to read the complete guidelines for authors concerning Stage 2 submissions at
http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/registered-reports. Please especially note the
requirements for data sharing, reporting the URL of the independently registered protocol, and
that withdrawing your manuscript will result in publication of a Withdrawn Registration.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science will introduce article processing charges for all new
submissions received from 1 January 2018. Registered Reports submitted and accepted after this
date will ONLY be subject to a charge if they subsequently progress to and are accepted as Stage
2 Registered Reports. If your manuscript is submitted and accepted for publication after 1
January 2018 (i.e. as a full Stage 2 Registered Report), you will be asked to pay the article
processing charge, unless you request a waiver and this is approved by Royal Society Publishing.
You can find out more about the charges at
http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/page/charges. Should you have any queries, please

Whether the data are able to test the authors’ proposed hypotheses by passing the approved
outcome-neutral criteria (such as absence of floor and ceiling effects or success of positive
controls)
The data are really strong. The decisions the authors made in stage were smart and carefully
considered. Nevertheless, analysis of the true data showed that some minor aspects of a priori
settings were to strict (i.e. initial analysis with 200 subjects). It is nice, that the authors do not try
to hide such issues. The same goes for the correlated errors on the behavioral side. They seem to
make sense to me (and should have been prespecified). I cannot easily comment on the
meaningfulness of the PM DLPFC correlation amongst residuals.
I am convinced for example that the analysis of competing methods for determining CT deserves
a lot off attention in the field and the wisest decision could have been to publish analysis on this
problem separately. This is probably not what should happen in the process of publishing a
preregistered report. The analysis reported here show, that using competing procedures for
measuring CT delivers vastly different results. Not more than one method is best suited to
measure CT. Therefore, for example, earlier results that are based on different methods are likely
to deliver wrong results. Indeed, the present paper provides sobering results for supporters of
CT-theories. The surprising and important result, that competing approaches for competing CT
deliver vastly different results and are different in reliability should be elaborated. Such a section
10
for example should also include the magnitude of the relation of competing approaches to
express CT across subjects.
Some of the important results should be moved from the supplement to the main text. After table
4 the authors should report associations of competing approaches to CT. Figures of CFA/SEM
should include standardized parameter estimates or separate tables should be provided.
Given only the ROI mask procedure seems to work in the present data it doesn’t strike me as
essential to also report results from procedures that seemingly fail to achieve what they were
designed for. Although it might not be in line with the policy of preregistration having reader go
through text sections that later turn out as irrelevant because the underlying procedure is flawed
seems somewhat unnecessary.
To be clear – I like the way data are handled here and I think over and beyond expected results
the authors should also report upon the correlation of competing measures for measuring CT. I
think the discussion should make some key results a little clearer. Agreed – the face factor wasn’t
very strong, but gathering stronger data together with brain data isn’t strongly encouraged by the
present data set. And the authors don’t make this statement really clear. The same goes for the
relation between CT and g. The conclusion drawn from the present data must be that the relation
between the two is very small – despite the large sample size and statistical power non adherents
of the theory that CT determines g would state it is zero. Given the authors use superior methods
and data relative to earlier reports, odds are that earlier reports on a positive association are false
positives. The present report should take a clear position concerning the consistency of different
data sets.
Whether the Introduction, rationale and stated hypotheses are the same as the approved Stage 1
submission
Yes
Whether the authors adhered precisely to the registered experimental procedures
Sufficiently
Where applicable, whether any unregistered exploratory statistical analyses are justified,
methodologically sound, and informative
Yes, absolutely.
Whether the authors’ conclusions are justified given the data
Yes.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Professor Chris Chambers):
The Stage 2 manuscript was returned to one of the original Stage 1 reviewers (the other reviewer
was not available), and I also read the manuscript myself. As you will see, the reviewer is overall
very positive, which is a testament to the high quality of the study and judicious attention to
detail throughout the submission. Nevertheless there are some relatively minor issues to address
concerning the reporting and interpretation of results. In revising the manucript to address the
reviewer's comments, please take special care (a) not to change the introduction or framing of the
study, and (b) not to allow the outcomes of exploratory post hoc analyses to dominate the
interpretation of the results over the outcomes of the preregistered analyses, in either the
Discussion or the Abstract. On an additional minor note, please ensure that the description of the
Stage 1 manuscript is consistent across the various footnotes, e.g replacing "In the registered
manuscript" in Footnote 6 with "In the accepted protocol..."
Concerning the reviewer's comment: "Although it might not be in line with the policy of
preregistration having reader go through text sections that later turn out as irrelevant because the
underlying procedure is flawed seems somewhat unnecessary." -- as the reviewer anticipates, it is
important to maintain an accurate history of the methodological plan, therefore please do not
remove this text.

to deliver wrong results. Indeed, the present paper provides sobering results for supporters of
CT-theories. The surprising and important result, that competing approaches for competing CT
deliver vastly different results and are different in reliability should be elaborated. Such a section
for example should also include the magnitude of the relation of competing approaches to
express CT across subjects.
Some of the important results should be moved from the supplement to the main text. After table
4 the authors should report associations of competing approaches to CT. Figures of CFA/SEM
should include standardized parameter estimates or separate tables should be provided.
Given only the ROI mask procedure seems to work in the present data it doesn’t strike me as
essential to also report results from procedures that seemingly fail to achieve what they were
designed for. Although it might not be in line with the policy of preregistration having reader go
through text sections that later turn out as irrelevant because the underlying procedure is flawed
seems somewhat unnecessary.
To be clear – I like the way data are handled here and I think over and beyond expected results
the authors should also report upon the correlation of competing measures for measuring CT. I
think the discussion should make some key results a little clearer. Agreed – the face factor wasn’t
very strong, but gathering stronger data together with brain data isn’t strongly encouraged by the
present data set. And the authors don’t make this statement really clear. The same goes for the
relation between CT and g. The conclusion drawn from the present data must be that the relation
between the two is very small – despite the large sample size and statistical power non adherents
of the theory that CT determines g would state it is zero. Given the authors use superior methods
and data relative to earlier reports, odds are that earlier reports on a positive association are false
positives. The present report should take a clear position concerning the consistency of different
data sets.

Appendix A
Article: Brain Structure Associated with Accuracy of Face Cognition – Global and Specific
Interindividual Differences in Cortical Thickness
Authors: Meyer, Kristina; Garzón, Benjamín; Lövdén, Martin; Hildebrandt, Andrea;
Reviewer: Paul A. Thompson, University of Oxford.
Overview:
The article discusses a proposed investigation of the relationship between Cortical thickness (a
neural correlate of performance and learning) in the brain network of Facial cognition and
performance on a battery of psychometric tests, specifically using tasks with facial content.
The investigation proposes to use structural equation modelling to quantify the relationships.
Review limitation:
I will only comment on the statistical elements of the article.
1. The importance of the research question(s).
I am not a subject expert in this field, so I can only give my opinion based on the information
presented. The research question appears important given that there has been limited previous
work relating individual differences in facial recognition to brain structure.
2. The logic, rationale, and plausibility of the proposed hypotheses.
The discussion of the proposed hypotheses is well explained and shows good judgement to build the
model incrementally (Hypothesis 1 -> Hypothesis 3).
The authors have been transparent when discussing the open access data and avoiding generation
of the hypotheses using a sub-sample of the data. I think this is a valid approach and the authors
correctly discard this sub-sample from the main analysis. The sub-sample appears to be a reasonable
size for the purpose of exploratory analysis to determine psychometric quality of the data and give
insight for power calculation simulations.
3. The soundness and feasibility of the methodology and analysis pipeline (including statistical
power analysis where applicable).
I will discuss the details of the methods in the order that they appear in the article.
Priori power analysis – The authors use Monte Carlo simulation to justify power, (which would also
be my choice) and is the gold standard in SEM. I have some concerns that the estimate of effect size
for Hypothesis 1 relies on sparse information that is, probably, of variable quality given the sample
size of previous studies discussed earlier in the manuscript. In particular, the justification for nested
face factors was too vague.
I would prefer that the authors give an improved justification perhaps looking at power for a range
of expected effect sizes that would be within a meaningful window of values. I do not suggest this to
be difficult as the authors have clearly made effort to estimate this accurately and I am happy to be
convinced by the authors in rebuttal, why their justification is adequate.
With regard to hypothesis 2 and 3, the power has again been determined via simulation using
estimates from the preliminary analysis. I think this approach is reasonable given the size of the sub-
sample for rough estimation of the effect sizes. Had the sub-sample been smaller, I would have been
considerably more critical. Pilot data for estimation of parameters is a typical method, although
there is no guarantee that the estimates will be reflective of the parameters in the main data. I feel
they will be sufficient for power calculations in this instance.
Handling Behavioural data and preliminary analyses – I think the authors are correct here in their
approach to use of preliminary analyses. If the main analyses were to be conducted without
consideration of data properties, such as ceiling effects and normality of distributions, then it would
be highly likely that the simulations for power would be misleading and potentially lead to model fit
issues and type I error as the authors hint. I am also pleased to see that the authors report that they
will use cross validation in the main analysis to add a degree of robustness to their findings.
The authors report the SEM models correctly and conclusions drawn in this section are accurate. The
addition of the accF factor shows a clear improvement of model fit and it will be interesting to see if
the findings are replicated in the main data analysis. I agree that the factor loadings should be
constrained for identical tasks at different time points as is standard practice.
MRI data processing and analysis – Not much to comment on here. The procedures are generally
contained within standard software and the authors give reference to versions and pre-processing
details. The only deviation is use of some custom scripts which the authors state “will be made
available via OSF upon publication” which is encouraging for reproducibility.
Dealing with Lateralization – I am not an expert in lateralization, so the author’s prediction seems
reasonable given the previously cited literature. Specifically documenting the right hemisphere
expectation of results is worth noting. I wonder if the authors have more specific predictions of
differences in model structure depending on side of ROI (this is purely out of interest rather than a
necessary change – authors can feel free to address this or not).
Dealing with potential confounds through handedness and family relationships – I am happy with
the control of handedness, as I believe this is appropriate. However, I would like much more detail
from the authors on the family relationships as this is a highly significant part of the model. Why do
the authors avoid using a multilevel approach to deal with the dependent observations? This needs
full justification including references to their proposed approach.
ROI extraction – Could the authors comment on whether they believe that depending on how the
parcelling of smaller groups into larger sections occurs, does this alters the SEM model results?
Test-Retest Reliability of CT measures – Fine.
SEM – Standard procedures documented here and entirely appropriate for the planned analysis.
4. Whether the clarity and degree of methodological detail would be sufficient to replicate the
proposed experimental procedures and analysis pipeline.
SEM – The analyses are generally well-documented, but I would like further clarity on the “Dealing
with potential confounds” specifically for family relationships. All R and Mplus scripts will be
documented and made available on an appropriate repository. In particular, scripts for power
should be uploaded prior to formal analysis.
MRI data processing – all documented adequately and references to version and procedures
provided. Additional custom scripts will be made available via OSF.
ROI extraction – The method seems appropriate but I would like to see that the model result is not
dependent on ROI specification. I do not know enough about these methods to say whether the ROIs
can be pre-specified before main SEM analysis?
5. Whether the authors provide a sufficiently clear and detailed description of the methods to
prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedures or analysis pipeline.
See 4.
6. Whether the authors have considered sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. absence of
floor or ceiling effects; positive controls; other quality checks) for ensuring that the results
obtained are able to test the stated hypotheses.
I think that the authors have considered this and made efforts to ensure an outcome–neutral result.
This was achieved using a sub-sample investigation.

Dear Professor Chris Chambers,
Hereby, we resubmit the manuscript “Brain Structure Associated with Accuracy of Face
Cognition – Global and Specific Interindividual Differences in Cortical Thickness” for further
evaluation as a Registered Report in the Journal “Royal Society Open Science” (RSOS).
We thank you and the reviewers for granting us the opportunity for this revision of our
egistered report at stage 1. We were happy to read that the reviewers agreed with us in
several points and expressed an overall positive evaluation of our approach. In the following,
you will find our numbered replies describing in which ways we addressed the comments and
suggestions the reviewers expressed. We are convinced that the study will greatly benefit
rom these inspiring ideas.
The resubmitted version of the article contains revisions that are highlighted in dark red
color.
Comments to the authors by Reviewer #1:
Review limitation: I will only comment on the statistical elements of the article.
The importance of the research question(s).
I am not a subject expert in this field, so I can only give my opinion based on the
information presented. The research question appears important given that there
has been limited previous work relating individual differences in facial recognition
to brain structure.
The logic, rationale, and plausibility of the proposed hypotheses.
The discussion of the proposed hypotheses is well explained and shows good
judgement to build the model incrementally (Hypothesis 1 -> Hypothesis 3). The
authors have been transparent when discussing the open access data and avoiding
generation of the hypotheses using a sub-sample of the data. I think this is a valid
approach and the authors correctly discard this sub-sample from the main analysis.
The sub-sample appears to be a reasonable size for the purpose of exploratory
analysis to determine psychometric quality of the data and give insight for power
calculation simulations.
The soundness and feasibility of the methodology and analysis pipeline (including
statistical power analysis where applicable).
I will discuss the details of the methods in the order that they appear in the article.
[1] Priori power analysis – The authors use Monte Carlo simulation to justify
power, (which would also be my choice) and is the gold standard in SEM. I have
some concerns that the estimate of effect size for Hypothesis 1 relies on sparse
information that is, probably, of variable quality given the sample size of previous
studies discussed earlier in the manuscript. In particular, the justification for nested
face factors was too vague. I would prefer that the authors give an improved
justification perhaps looking at power for a range of expected effect sizes that would
be within a meaningful window of values. I do not suggest this to be difficult as the
authors have clearly made effort to estimate this accurately and I am happy to be
convinced by the authors in rebuttal, why their justification is adequate.
We agree that effect sizes reported in other studies are not exhaustive estimators of the
effects to be expected in our prospective sample. Although intuitively we think that the
sample is convincingly large (especially as compared with many other neuroscience
studies in the field), we now apply a range of effect sizes in the Monte Carlo power
simulation as the reviewer suggested. Note, however, that the loadings on the nested
factor were already set very conservatively. We assume standardized factor loadings of
.60 on the general factor of cortical thickness and .30 on the nested face-specific factor of
cortical thickness, taking into account that loadings on nested factors are typically lower.
Assuming standardized loadings below .30 with the given number of indicators will
clearly lead to problems identifying the nested factor. We now use a range of +/-.10
around the factor loadings on the general factor, but we see .30 as the lowest possible
value to identify the nested factor. The power simulation including a range around the
effect sizes (factor loadings) and a few sentences on the matter of loadings lower than .30
have been added to the manuscript (p. 4).
With regard to hypothesis 2 and 3, the power has again been determined via
simulation using estimates from the preliminary analysis. I think this approach is
reasonable given the size of the subsample for rough estimation of the effect sizes.
Had the sub-sample been smaller, I would have been considerably more critical.
Pilot data for estimation of parameters is a typical method, although there is no
guarantee that the estimates will be reflective of the parameters in the main data. I
feel they will be sufficient for power calculations in this instance.
Handling Behavioural data and preliminary analyses – I think the authors are
correct here in their approach to use of preliminary analyses. If the main analyses
were to be conducted without consideration of data properties, such as ceiling effects
and normality of distributions, then it would be highly likely that the simulations for
power would be misleading and potentially lead to model fit issues and type I error
as the authors hint. I am also pleased to see that the authors report that they will use

and it will be interesting to see if the findings are replicated in the main data
analysis. I agree that the factor loadings should be constrained for identical tasks at

are generally contained within standard software and the authors give reference to
versions and pre-processing details. The only deviation is use of some custom scripts
which the authors state “will be made available via OSF upon publication” which is
encouraging for reproducibility.
[2] Dealing with Lateralization – I am not an expert in lateralization, so the author’s
prediction seems reasonable given the previously cited literature. Specifically
documenting the right hemisphere expectation of results is worth noting. I wonder if
the authors have more specific predictions of differences in model structure
depending on side of ROI (this is purely out of interest rather than a necessary
change – authors can feel free to address this or not).
As we also point out in the paper, there is some evidence that face-responsive brain areas
in the right hemisphere show a stronger activation than the respective right-sided areas
when subjects view face stimuli. However, to our knowledge, there is no indication in the
literature letting us believe that the postulated model structure of individual differences in
cortical thickness (CT) will be hemisphere-specific. In line with the literature on mean
differences in activation strength between the hemispheres, we expect the intercepts of
indicators originating from the CT measures in the left hemisphere to be lower. Factor
loadings may or may not be lower, because the magnitude of loadings only partly
depends on the mean structure through potential variance restriction. If factor loadings of
indicators from the left hemisphere are constricted (lower factor reliability) the prediction
accuracy of face cognition performance by a specific nested factor of CT in the left
hemisphere would be expected to be somewhat weaker. We do however not expect the
relations for the left hemisphere indicators to be absent or reversed, but we now plan to
explore any arising effect differences outside the postulated boundaries in an exploratory
part of our study (this is because precise predictions cannot be made in the light of the
present literature).
We added a sentence in the manuscript (p. 8) to explain this.
[3] Dealing with potential confounds through handedness and family relationships –
I am happy with the control of handedness, as I believe this is appropriate.
However, I would like much more detail from the authors on the family
relationships as this is a highly significant part of the model. Why do the authors
avoid using a multilevel approach to deal with the dependent observations? This
needs full justification including references to their proposed approach.
We fully agree that nestedness of the data due to family relations needs to be accounted
for. A multilevel modeling approach is the way to deal with nested (clustered) data
structures, but this method would be justified if we had research questions concerning the
clusters. Instead, we are interested in how the relations generally vary across individuals,
independently on whether the within cluster relations vary across family clusters. In the
HCP data we have the challenge that some observations are not independent, but
clustered based on family relatedness – this concerns only a part of the sample. There are
statistical approaches that allow to correct for dependency of observations. Given that our
research questions are related to overall relationships we view an approach where we
control/correct for nestedness as the most suitable approach. Additionally, such an
approach is appropriate, because only a part of the sample includes persons in family
relationships. MPlus offers a solution for correcting standard error bias that will be
induced through the dependency of observations. The ANALYSIS=COMPLEX
command, after specifying the family dependency as a clustering variable, will provide
corrected standard errors without estimating within and between cluster coefficients.
Thus, with this option, standard errors and the chi-square test of model fit are adjusted,
taking into account non-independence of observations due to clustered sampling (see
Muthén & Muthén, 1998-2010, pp. 239 ff). Simulation studies show that this method is
well suited to adjust for interdependence of observations (Muthén & Satorra, 1995). The
method has been applied and evaluated in further studies (Asparouhov, 2005, 2006;
Asparouhov & Muthén, 2005, 2006). The general recommendation is to use this option if
there are at least 20 clusters, dependent observations. The HCP sample comprises 456
families of varying configuration. We realize that this choice was not communicated
clearly enough in the previous version of our manuscript. We thus added a few sentences
to the section 4.3.2 (p. 8) for clarification.
A further alternative proposed in the literature would be the use of a permutation method
published by Winkler et al. (2015). This approach deals with interdependence of
observations by introducing blocks of observations for which restrictions in
exchangeability are set. Observations belonging to a cluster, such as a family, cannot be
shuffled freely, but only within boundaries with respect to their family status. This
approach has been applied to a part of the HCP data in Winkler et al. (2015) and it was
found to perform well at investigating heritability in the sample. Because we do not aim
to address questions with respect to heritability, we prefer to preregister the
aforementioned and well-established method by Muthén and Satorra (1995) that corrects
standard errors biased through observations’ dependency.

[4] ROI extraction – Could the authors comment on whether they believe that
depending on how the parcelling of smaller groups into larger sections occurs, does
this alters the SEM model results?
Thank you for this question. We understand and agree with your concern that the use of
different parcels may lead to somewhat different results.
The use of broader and more wide-spread sections of the cortex is relevant for the present
study. This way, we hope to capture variance in CT within a person across the brain.
These larger sections have been found by Glasser and colleagues (2016), who used
functional, structural and cytoarchitectonic information in order to differentiate brain
areas from each other. The larger sections can be broken down into smaller parcels. In the
end, the calculation in our case will be as follows: We will consider the entire selected
sections, leave out those parcels which we know from previous research to be related
with face processing, and compute the average CT from all the vertices comprised in each
of the parcels in that section. The ROIs used to indicate the specific face-related factor are
much smaller than that, but it is our aim to cover a larger section of the brain for
indicating a general CT factor. Importantly, the choice of the ROI for indicating the
general CT factor will not be data-driven. It is decided which parcels we will use. Our
exact choices of parcels corresponding to the parcellation of Glasser and colleagues
(2016) and they are exactly specified in our scripts. Thus, there will be no data driven
researchers’ degrees of freedom involved in this choice.
We added a few sentences to the manuscript (p. 9) to communicate this approach more
clearly.
Test-Retest Reliability of CT measures – Fine.
SEM – Standard procedures documented here and entirely appropriate for the
planned analysis.
Whether the clarity and degree of methodological detail would be sufficient to
replicate the proposed experimental procedures and analysis pipeline.
SEM – The analyses are generally well-documented, but I would like further clarity
on the “Dealing with potential confounds” specifically for family relationships.
All R and Mplus scripts will be documented and made available on an appropriate
repository. In particular, scripts for power should be uploaded prior to formal
analysis.
MRI data processing – all documented adequately and references to version and
procedures provided. Additional custom scripts will be made available via OSF.
[5] ROI extraction – The method seems appropriate but I would like to see that the
model result is not dependent on ROI specification. I do not know enough about
these methods to say whether the ROIs can be pre-specified before main SEM
analysis?
We agree that it is reasonable to pre-specify the ROIs before the SEM analysis (see issue
#[4]). Because it seemed too arbitrary to parcel the entire cortex ourselves, we chose the
Glasser et al. (2016) parcellation as a basis. This modern atlas segregates the brain into 22
large regions which in turn can be broken down into a total of 180 smaller regions.
Importantly, the parcellation is based on several structural and functional measures, but
was created without relation to the research questions asked here.
We applied a number of criteria to choose the most appropriate ROIs for later analyses.
Mostly, the reliability of CT measures found in other studies and the fact whether or not a
section of the brain includes a face-related area were taken into account. Importantly,
because we agree that the choice of too narrow ROIs for the general factor of CT would
probably alter the results, we picked regions that spread widely across the entire cortex
and are functionally not strongly related with each other. This way, we aim to avoid that
the regions share much variance due to a common functionality, as we expect the face-
selective regions to do.
Whether the authors provide a sufficiently clear and detailed description of the
methods to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedures or
analysis pipeline.
See above.
Whether the authors have considered sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g.
absence of floor or ceiling effects; positive controls; other quality checks) for
ensuring that the results obtained are able to test the stated hypotheses.
I think that the authors have considered this and made efforts to ensure an
outcome–neutral result. This was achieved using a sub-sample investigation.
Comments to the authors by Reviewer #2
The importance of the research question(s).
I think this research is important. There is strong behavioral evidence concerning
the specificity of face and emotion processing in humans. There is also decent
biological evidence concerning details of face and emotion processing. The interplay
of both levels is somewhat less clearly established – specifically when it comes to
cortical thickness.
The logic, rationale, and plausibility of the proposed hypotheses.
The logic of the study is straightforward. If face-perception and face-recognition are
distinct abilities in the sense that they cannot be fully accounted for through other
(established) abilities and if it is true that there are specialized regions for face-
processing, then better performance should be associated with higher volume of
specialized regions. The expectations are well motivated, the available data are
strong in terms of allowing a sound test of the predictions, and the proposed analysis
is well-suited to provide a strong conclusion.
The soundness and feasibility of the methodology and analysis pipeline (including
statistical power analysis where applicable).
The study is based on a reanalysis of outstanding data. Obviously, power
considerations might be deemed post hoc – but either way, given the large sample
power is not a problem (unlike the situation in the majority of MRI studies).
[6] I have more expertise for the behavioral side of the study. The model proposed in
figure 1 panel 2 stands a decent chance to fit the data (and better than the model in
panel 1). Are the df in the model reported in the manuscript correct? Obviously, if
the same does not apply to figure 2 panels 2 and 1 respectively, there is little point in
estimating the model in figure 3.
Thank you for pointing to the typo with respect to the degrees of freedom. We corrected
them (p. 6). Furthermore, we agree that the model in figure 3 only needs to be estimated
if the nested face-specific factor of CT turns out to be identified. This is the case if the CT
model including the nested factor would fit the data better than the general CT factor
model only. We added a sentence describing this detail of the model sequence to the
sections 4.4 (p. 8) and 4.4.3 (p. 9), respectively.
Again, a nested factor for the behavioral side has been shown repeatedly – and
similar evidence is presented for cortical thickness.
Whether the clarity and degree of methodological detail would be sufficient to
replicate the proposed experimental procedures and analysis pipeline.
[7] The procedure is really pretty clear. I am not an MRI expert but a quick search
shows that there are alternative and arguably competing methods to
measure/calculate/estimate cortical thickness. Here are some papers I found in a
quick search:

based_cortical_thickness_measurements_in_MRI
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811916307637
The authors should add a paragraph or two clarifying these issues.
We added a paragraph to the Introduction section of the manuscript (p. 2) and the
Methods section (p. 4) explaining why we favor surface-based over voxel-based
morphometry (VBM) approaches. Mostly, VBM methods appear difficult to interpret and
less reliable in comparison to SBM methods. SBM methods, in turn, yield measures such
as the geometrically measurable thickness of the outer cortex, which directly represents
an anatomical feature of the brain. This seems more plausible and straight-forward to
interpret.
In addition to this general preference grounded in theoretical reasons, there is also a
practical advantage to use CT instead of VBM measures in the present study: The HCP
developers provide CT maps of the brain which have been obtained in collaboration with
the software developers of FreeSurfer and FSL. These maps have been created using
state-of-the-art statistical methods that are designed and optimized specifically for dealing
with the high dimensional HCP data. Building upon and trusting the extensive expertise
of the HCP researchers, we do not anticipate to come up with an equally good or even
better pipeline ourselves, should we choose to use VBM measures instead. Thus, for
practical as well as for theoretical reasons, we decided to stick to the established
alternative by the HCP experts. Using these measures reduces costs in terms of time and
fosters reproducibility by other researcher.
[8] The control of sex and age on the latent variable was not completely clear to me.
Wouldn’t it be better to partial sex and age effects on the level of manifest variables
and move on analyzing residuals? At least for sex the sample size would permit
estimating multiple group CFA – if that were an interesting research question.
Given the available literature on sex differences in face-processing this might be the
case.
Thanks for your suggestions.
Age: Given that all subjects are younger adults, we expect that there will be no
considerable effects of age in the sample. Therefore, we think that our approach –
keeping age as a covariate – should be sufficiently prudent and well suited to deal with
potential, but expectedly minor age effects. Because our main hypotheses are related to
parameters at the latent level, we aim to control for age at the level of the latent variables.
Sex: We agree that additionally performing the analyses simultaneously on two groups
would be interesting to investigate how sex would moderate the findings. Above
behavioral findings on sex differences mentioned by the reviewer, there is also research
showing that the lateralization of activity in face-responsive areas depends on sex,
meaning that it was found in males, but not in females:
Proverbio, A. M., Brignone, V., Matarazzo, S., Del Zotto, M., & Zani, A. (2006). Gender
differences in hemispheric asymmetry for face processing. BMC neuroscience, 7(1), 44.
Therefore, we will perform an additional separate exploratory analysis investigating sex
differences. The procedure is now described in the methods section (p. 8).
Whether the authors provide a sufficiently clear and detailed description of the
methods to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedures or
analysis pipeline.
The method is sufficiently clear and detailed. The “researcher degrees of freedom”
are very limited. An independent team of researchers would be able to exactly
replicate the models, results, and inferences.
[9] Although I am not an expert, it might be an option to specify localized tasks
differently. Currently the authors propose to classify tasks according to stimulus
content. An alternative could be to use only trials from 3.3.2.2 and ignore 3.3.2.1. I
am not sure how decisive the nature of face stimuli is for completion of 3.3.2.1. May
be there is evidence I am not aware of that shows that WM tasks with face content
are face specific just like other face-tasks.
In Barch et al. (2013), the localizer tasks are described and tested. The authors explain
that if the research aim is to identify cortex regions responding to specific stimulus types,
“one can collapse across memory load and focus only on stimulus type comparisons“ (p.
172). This is the case for our study. In other studies, WM tasks are used as localizer tasks
for identifying face-responsive areas as well (e.g. Ishai, Pessoa, Bikle, & Ungerleider,
2004; Rossion et al., 2003). The localizer tasks in the HCP study are relatively easy and
face stimuli can be contrasted with non-face stimuli. Altogether, we believe that the
procedure localizing in terms of content is very common, which is also the reason why
these two tasks using facial stimuli were included in the HCP measurement battery.

We agree that alternatively conducting a process based localization to be contrasted with
stimulus content localization in terms of resulting relationships with psychometric
performance would be an interesting research question on its own. We however think that
it would go beyond the present scope and decided to keep the aims straightforward and
conduct a stimulus type based localization here. We thank the reviewer for the inspiring
idea which we consider very interesting for future research.
Whether the authors have considered sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g.
absence of floor or ceiling effects; positive controls; other quality checks) for
ensuring that the results obtained are able to test the stated hypotheses.
[10] Provided the available data allow specification of cortical thickness variables in
non-face areas, these could be used to confirm that face specific relations are found
for face specific behavioral and biological indicators but no such relationships can
be found for non face specific data. This might strengthen the point the authors like
to make.
We agree that it would be interesting to introduce additional nested factors, encompassing
CT in other specific, but not face-related areas of the brain. However, we see several
disadvantages in such an approach. First and foremost, there are specific hypotheses as to
which areas should belong to the core network of face cognition. This makes it relatively
easy to predict which areas might share variance in their CT if, as we assume, the use of
these areas in simultaneous tasks leads to a simultaneous growth of CT in these areas. We
can imagine that such common variance might be found among other, functionally related
brain regions as well. However, it currently seems arbitrary which areas would be well
suited for such an endeavor. Second, the entire analysis sequence will be quite extensive
already. Adding additional nested factors for object/place processing for example would
take away some of its parsimony and render the results to become more difficult to
interpret. Finally, results will be meaningful with respect to methodology of structural
MRI, but the approach is quite new. We would think it preferable to test the approach in a
circumscribed number of ROIs and potentially extend and refine it later by adding other
factors for comparison, if the approach turns out to be promising. We will discuss this
future potential when we are submitting our full manuscript including results and
discussion.
Again, we express our sincere gratitude for your constructive feedback. We hope that our
evisions erase the reviewer’s concerns and that we will soon be able to start the data analysis.
Sincerely,

Dear Professor Chris Chambers, dear editors,
We hereby resubmit the registered report RSOS-180857.R2 for a second review (stage
2). The manuscript was unsubmitted on June 3rd to give us the chance to address suggestions
offered by the editorial office. We were thankful to receive your sensible comments.
In the study, we investigated whether we can predict specific face cognition abilities
by individual differences in cortical thickness (CT) in the core brain network of face
cognition. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we discovered a latent factor
architecture of CT reminiscent of models explaining behavioral performance. This is evidence
hat in line with our first hypothesis, brain areas sharing the purpose of processing faces
develop morphologically in parallel. When investigating the relationship between brain and
behavior, however, a pattern was discovered that was not predicted. We expected CT in the
core network of face cognition to predict performance in tasks with face stimuli. Instead, CT
n the face network predicted general cognitive performance.
Thank you for providing guidance to correct errors found in the accepted part of the
manuscript in your response we received on June 3rd. As suggested, we (1) ensured that the
ink to the stage 1 manuscript is now more explicitly mentioned on page 22 in the Data
Accessibility section, we (2) changed the introduction and methods section to the past tense
and (3) altered the title and summary in accordance with the study conclusion. Finally, we
made necessary corrections to the preregistered part of the protocol more visible to the readers
by adding footnotes and a specific section in the manuscript right before the Results section
4.5 Deviations from Protocol). Furthermore, changes in the manuscript can still be tracked to
make them easily detectable for the reviewers. If you or the reviewers are of a different
opinion in some of the points, we would be grateful if you could get in contact with us. It is
our express desire to be fully transparent and support this type of publication, but we also
hink that no paper can be published while we know it contains inconsistencies.
We confirm that we applied the preregistered analysis in its approved form.
Furthermore, the analysis was not started before receiving in-principal-acceptance from
label_version_6
RSOS. Any preliminary analyses were approved at stage 1 and included in the stage 1
manuscript. All data are freely available after registration at the Human Connectome Project
www.humanconnectome.org). All scripts and subject IDs necessary to repeat our analyses
are available on our study’s OSF site (the link can be found on the manuscript pages 9, 17 and
22): https://osf.io/p7c8z/
After adhering to our preregistered analysis protocol, we discovered that not all of our
decisions we made in the stage 1 protocol were optimal. Despite our efforts to perform a
preliminary analysis in a sub-sample of N = 200 participants, we found that the models we
preregistered did only partly yield interpretable results when applied to the full sample of N =
854. In SEM, a good model fit is a crucial prerequisite for drawing any meaningful
conclusions about the parameter estimates. Thus, in addition to reporting the results of the
preregistered analysis without any changes, we added post-hoc analyses that are clearly
marked as such in the manuscript. In these, we altered the SEMs in ways that better accounted
or the data. These changes did not alter the logic of the model sequences and were rather
minor. Furthermore, we discovered unusually low manifest correlations between some of the
CT measures. Thus, alongside our preregistered reliability analysis of CT measurements, we
provided an additional comparison between three different ways of defining face-related brain
egions of interest (ROIs).
Again, we confirm that the study conforms to Standard 8 of the American
Psychological Association’s Ethical Principles of Psychologist and Code of Conduct. The
data were treated according to the WU-Minn HCP Consortium data use terms and the terms of
use for the restricted data. The authors declare no conflict of interest. The manuscript does not
nclude any copyrighted material. The present manuscript is an original work, it is not
published or being considered for publication anywhere else (partially or entirely).
We thank you once more for your kind support and guidance. We look forward to
hearing from you.
Sincerely,

Dear Professor Chris Chambers, dear reviewer,
We thank you again for granting us the opportunity for this minor revision of our
egistered report at stage 2. In the following, you will find our replies describing in which
ways we addressed the comments and suggestions.
The resubmitted version of the article contains revisions that are highlighted in dark red
color.
Associate Editor Comments to Author (Professor Chris Chambers):
The Stage 2 manuscript was returned to one of the original Stage 1 reviewers (the other
reviewer was not available), and I also read the manuscript myself. As you will see, the
reviewer is overall very positive, which is a testament to the high quality of the study
and judicious attention to detail throughout the submission. Nevertheless there are some
relatively minor issues to address concerning the reporting and interpretation of results.
In revising the manucript to address the reviewer's comments, please take special care
a) not to change the introduction or framing of the study, and (b) not to allow the
outcomes of exploratory post hoc analyses to dominate the interpretation of the results
over the outcomes of the preregistered analyses, in either the Discussion or the Abstract.
On an additional minor note, please ensure that the description of the Stage 1
manuscript is consistent across the various footnotes, e.g replacing "In the registered
manuscript" in Footnote 6 with "In the accepted protocol..."
Thank you for reading the manuscript and providing your opinion. We changed the footnote
6. We also tried to adhere to your suggestion not to focus mainly on the results from the post-
hoc analyses. However, we are facing the difficult situation that all of the preregistered
hypotheses were falsified. With the non-significant results, we cannot contribute to the
understanding of the relationship between CT and cognitive behavior. All we might be able to
do when focusing only of the preregistered pipeline is to state that our hypotheses were
alsified given that specific pipeline. However, we think that the results of the post-hoc
analyses in addition to the preregistered ones are interesting to the community and should be
eported and interpreted. There is naturally an imbalance here: the results from the post-hoc
analyses are richer and require more interpretation.
Therefore, we now emphasize more strongly in the Discussion and Abstract that the results
we can interpret are acquired from exploratory analyses and require cross-validation. We hope
you can agree with this view.
Concerning the reviewer's comment: "Although it might not be in line with the policy of
preregistration having reader go through text sections that later turn out as irrelevant
because the underlying procedure is flawed seems somewhat unnecessary." -- as the
reviewer anticipates, it is important to maintain an accurate history of the
methodological plan, therefore please do not remove this text.
Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
Whether the data are able to test the authors’ proposed hypotheses by passing the
approved outcome-neutral criteria (such as absence of floor and ceiling effects or success
of positive controls)
The data are really strong. The decisions the authors made in stage were smart and
carefully considered. Nevertheless, analysis of the true data showed that some minor
aspects of a priori settings were to strict (i.e. initial analysis with 200 subjects). It is nice,
hat the authors do not try to hide such issues. The same goes for the correlated errors
on the behavioral side. They seem to make sense to me (and should have been
prespecified). I cannot easily comment on the meaningfulness of the PM DLPFC
correlation amongst residuals.
I am convinced for example that the analysis of competing methods for determining CT
deserves a lot off attention in the field and the wisest decision could have been to publish
analysis on this problem separately. This is probably not what should happen in the
process of publishing a preregistered report. The analysis reported here show, that using
competing procedures for measuring CT delivers vastly different results. Not more than
one method is best suited to measure CT. Therefore, for example, earlier results that are
based on different methods are likely to deliver wrong results. Indeed, the present paper
provides sobering results for supporters of CT-theories.
The surprising and important result, that competing approaches for competing CT
deliver vastly different results and are different in reliability should be elaborated. Such
a section for example should also include the magnitude of the relation of competing
approaches to express CT across subjects.
Thank you for your overall positive view on our work and for recognizing our attempts to be
ransparent in handling the data. Following your suggestion, we extended the section 6.4
Reliability of CT Measures in the Extended ROIs by further information on the relationship
between alternative measures of CT as implemented in exploratory analysis above the
confirmatory ones.
As mentioned in the respective section of the article, the most direct way to address your
comment would have been to provide correlations of latent variables of CT measures in the
ace network. However, in 5 mm and 10 mm ROIs, these factors were not identified.
Therefore, we instead provide a supplementary figure depicting the relationships between
measurements at a manifest level, which also clearly delivers the picture showing that the CT
esults from functional localization and the across-subject masks are quite distinct. The range
of the correlations between the different measurement approaches is given in the text.
Correlations between CT measures acquired using different functional localizations are much
higher than correlations between the mask-based CT values and the results from functional
ocalization. This is not surprising, but important to be emphasized. We now added a few
sentences to the discussion elaborating on alternatives to CT measurement.
Some of the important results should be moved from the supplement to the main text.
After table 4 the authors should report associations of competing approaches to CT.
Figures of CFA/SEM should include standardized parameter estimates or separate
ables should be provided.
We agree with you that the standardized parameter estimates are crucial information.
However, three out of the four figures depicting measurement/structural models for
hypothesis testing were not in the results part, but in the methods part to visualize the
hypothesis. Furthermore, if we wanted to include standardized parameters to the figures, two
igures per model would be needed in order to represent the slightly divergent parameters for
CT in the left and right hemisphere. We fear that this would impair the readability of the
article or render the figures rather overloaded. Another option would be to include the tables
of the supplements into the article, but the article is already filled densely with information.
Again, the readability would be an issue. We thus propose the following solution: We added a
ange of standardized factor loadings for each latent factor besides the regression weights
already mentioned in the text. This way, we hope that the reader gets an idea of the
magnitude. For all details, the reader will consult the supplements.
Given only the ROI mask procedure seems to work in the present data it doesn’t strike
me as essential to also report results from procedures that seemingly fail to achieve what
hey were designed for. Although it might not be in line with the policy of
preregistration having reader go through text sections that later turn out as irrelevant
because the underlying procedure is flawed seems somewhat unnecessary.
The Associate Editor already responded to this, confirming the notion that removing the text
does not conform to the idea of the registered report.
To be clear – I like the way data are handled here and I think over and beyond expected
results the authors should also report upon the correlation of competing measures for
measuring CT. I think the discussion should make some key results a little clearer.
Agreed – the face factor wasn’t very strong, but gathering stronger data together with
brain data isn’t strongly encouraged by the present data set. And the authors don’t
make this statement really clear. The same goes for the relation between CT and g. The
conclusion drawn from the present data must be that the relation between the two is
very small – despite the large sample size and statistical power non adherents of the
heory that CT determines g would state it is zero. Given the authors use superior
methods and data relative to earlier reports, odds are that earlier reports on a positive
association are false positives. The present report should take a clear position
concerning the consistency of different data sets.
Thank you for your ideas. We agree that the results do not suggest that behavior is strongly
driven by individual differences in CT. Of course the face-specific performance factor is not
based on a very rigorous measurement of face cognition. Thus, we argue that it would be very
nteresting to observe the relationship between a strong face cognition factor and the network
CT in the core face network. However, you are right to point out that our study calls the
esults of smaller samples into question, as the relationship between brain and behavior are
very small here. We have altered the discussion with this notion in mind and hope that it is
now more clearly delivered.
Whether the Introduction, rationale and stated hypotheses are the same as the approved
Stage 1 submission
Yes
Whether the authors adhered precisely to the registered experimental procedures
Sufficiently
Where applicable, whether any unregistered exploratory statistical analyses are
ustified, methodologically sound, and informative
Yes, absolutely.
Whether the authors’ conclusions are justified given the data
Yes.
Thank you again for your insightful comments and helpful ideas. We hope that we
were able to address your last concerns in full. Otherwise, please let us know.
