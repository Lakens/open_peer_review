The authors have done a decent job by proposing a noval way to find the analytical solution to
the NPDEs and their ideas are well supported by two applications in the case of solving DSW and
PIB equations. In my opinion, if the flaws of the article in the following two aspects can be
properly addressed, it should be suitable for publication:
1. More detailed comparison between the enhance expansion method (EEM) and the original
expansion method should be give to show the advantage of EEM.
2. More detailed future plans of the development of EEM should be given in the CONCLUSION
section to draw more interest.

This is an interesting paper devoted to application of a method for obtaining exact solutions of
nonlinear PDEs to two equations of interest for mathematical modelling of natural processes. The
methodology is
sound and the results may be of interest for mathematicians and physicists. There is however a
point that must be cleared and because of this a small revision of the manuscript is needed. The
point is as follows.
Let us consider Eq. 5 as simplest equation and Eq. 4 as solution, constructed on the basis of the
solutions of the simplest Eq. 5. Thus the applied method is an interesting version of the modified
method of simplest equation. Because of this I have the following suggestions for a revision:
1. The method of simplest equation has been developed and applied by Kudryashov. Cite several
on his papers on this method
2. The modified method of simplest equation as a variant of Kudryashov method of simplest
equation
has been published in 2010 and 2011. Cite several of these papers (Citations [1] and [2] are not the
3
original papers of the method)
3. The originality of the approach used in the manuscript is that Eq. 4 is not of the kind of series
used usually in the applications of the modified method of simplest equation. Then the present
approach extends the methodology of the modified method of simplest equation and this feature
of the used method should be state as it is a positive development contributed by the manuscript

Decision letter (RSOS-140406)
12-May-2015
Dear Dr Khan,
The Subject Editor assigned to your paper ("Study of Coupled Nonlinear Partial Differential
Equations for finding Exact Analytical Solutions") has now received comments from reviewers.
We would like you to revise your paper in accordance with the referee and Subject Editor
suggestions which can be found below (not including confidential reports to the Editor). Please
note this decision does not guarantee eventual acceptance.
Please submit a copy of your revised paper within three weeks (i.e. by the 04-Jun-2015). If we do
not hear from you within this time then it will be assumed that the paper has been withdrawn. In
exceptional circumstances, extensions may be possible if agreed with the Editorial Office in
advance.We do not allow multiple rounds of revision so we urge you to make every effort to
fully address all of the comments at this stage. If deemed necessary by the Editors, your
manuscript will be sent back to one or more of the original reviewers for assessment. If the
original reviewers are not available we may invite new reviewers.
To revise your manuscript, log into http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision. Revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your
Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you must respond to the comments made by the
referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". Please use this to
document how you have responded to the comments, and the adjustments you have made. In
order to expedite the processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in
your response.
In addition to addressing all of the reviewers' and editor's comments please also ensure that your
revised manuscript contains the following sections before the reference list:
• Ethics statement
If your study uses humans or animals please include details of the ethical approval received,
including the name of the committee that granted approval. For human studies please also detail
whether informed consent was obtained. For field studies on animals please include details of all
permissions, licences and/or approvals granted to carry out the fieldwork.
• Data accessibility
It is a condition of publication that all supporting data are made available either as
supplementary information or preferably in a suitable permanent repository. The data
accessibility section should state where the article's supporting data can be accessed. This section
should also include details, where possible of where to access other relevant research materials
such as statistical tools, protocols, software etc can be accessed. If the data has been deposited in
an external repository this section should list the database, accession number and link to the DOI
for all data from the article that has been made publicly available. Data sets that have been
4
deposited in an external repository and have a DOI should also be appropriately cited in the
manuscript and included in the reference list.
• Competing interests
Please declare any financial or non-financial competing interests, or state that you have no
competing interests.
• Authors’ contributions
All submissions, other than those with a single author, must include an Authors’ Contributions
section which individually lists the specific contribution of each author. The list of Authors
should meet all of the following criteria; 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, or
acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it
critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published.
All contributors who do not meet all of these criteria should be included in the
acknowledgements.
We suggest the following format:
AB carried out the molecular lab work, participated in data analysis, carried out sequence
alignments, participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript; CD carried out
the statistical analyses; EF collected field data; GH conceived of the study, designed the study,
coordinated the study and helped draft the manuscript. All authors gave final approval for
publication.
• Acknowledgements
Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship
criteria.
• Funding statement
Please list the source of funding for each author.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.
Yours sincerely,

This is an interesting paper devoted to application of a method for obtaining exact solutions of
nonlinear PDEs to two equations of interest for mathematical modelling of natural processes. The
methodology is
sound and the results may be of interest for mathematicians and physicists. There is however a
point that must be cleared and because of this a small revision of the manuscript is needed. The
point is as follows.
Let us consider Eq. 5 as simplest equation and Eq. 4 as solution, constructed on the basis of the
solutions of the simplest Eq. 5. Thus the applied method is an interesting version of the modified
method of simplest equation. Because of this I have the following suggestions for a revision:
1. The method of simplest equation has been developed and applied by Kudryashov. Cite several
on his papers on this method
2. The modified method of simplest equation as a variant of Kudryashov method of simplest
equation
has been published in 2010 and 2011. Cite several of these papers (Citations [1] and [2] are not the
