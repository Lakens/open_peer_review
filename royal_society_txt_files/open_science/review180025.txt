The manuscript by Siying et al. describes a systematic study to investigate the major factors that
impact the formation of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) from Poly (diallyldimethyl
ammonium chloride) (polyDADMAC) as precursor. N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) has
drawn a significant concern as it is considered as a potential human carcinogen. In this study, an
orthogonal experiment design by varying pH values, ammonia, bromide concentration, natural
organic matter (NOM) and monochloramine dosages was conducted. According to authors’
results, that pH was most important factor affecting NDMA formation from polyDADMAC.
Meanwhile, the presence of bromide enhanced NDMA formation at all pH values. On the other
hand, the presence of NOM can reduce NDMA formation from polyDADMAC. Overall, the
manuscript is well written and organized. Comprehensive experiments with well-controlled
variables were performed to provide solid support of author's findings. I would recommend the
publication of this manuscript as it is.
Some grammar errors or type errors do appear in main text. For example, in Page 6, line 2,
“orthogonal experimental design to invest the effects” should be “orthogonal experimental
design to investigate the effects” Extra proof-reading is required for the manuscript.

The manuscript (ID: RSOS-180025) entitled “Factors Affecting N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA)
Formation From polyDADMAC Degradation During Chloramination“ is interesting and in my
3
opinion important in its field. The authors explain carefully the experimental procedures, the aim
and significance of the work is also explained. My concerns are due the statistical analysis. First is
not described in the materials and methods. The authors indicated that the detection limits were
obtained, they do not indicate how. They also do not indicate the number of replicates used and
the error bars in graphics of figures 2 and 3 accordingly to the authors’ information are not the
result of several replicates.
The schemes presented in figure 5 should be carefully revised especially the proposed hydrolysis
of an imine.

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
Dear Editors and Reviewers,
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning
our manuscript entitled “Factors Affecting N-nitrosodimethylamine
(NDMA) Formation from PolyDADMAC Degradation During
Chloramination” (ID: RSOS-180025). Those comments are all
valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our paper, as
well as the important guiding significance to our researches. We have
studied comments carefully and have made correction which we hope
meet with approval. Revised portion are marked in red in the paper.
The main corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s
comments are as flowing:
Reviewer #1:
<comments> The manuscript by Siying et al. describes a systematic
study to investigate the major factors that impact the formation of
N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) from Poly (diallyldimethyl
ammonium chloride) (polyDADMAC) as precursor.
N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) has drawn a significant concern as
it is considered as a potential human carcinogen. In this study, an
orthogonal experiment design by varying pH values, ammonia,
bromide concentration, natural organic matter (NOM) and
monochloramine dosages was conducted. According to authors’ results,
that pH was most important factor affecting NDMA formation from
polyDADMAC. Meanwhile, the presence of bromide enhanced
NDMA formation at all pH values. On the other hand, the presence of
NOM can reduce NDMA formation from polyDADMAC. Overall, the
manuscript is well written and organized. Comprehensive experiments
with well-controlled variables were performed to provide solid support
of author's findings. I would recommend the publication of this
manuscript as it is.
Question 1: Some grammar errors or type errors do appear in main text.
For example, in Page 6, line 2, “orthogonal experimental design to
invest the effects” should be “orthogonal experimental design to
investigate the effects” Extra proof-reading is required for the
manuscript.
Reply: We are very sorry for our incorrect writing. Revised portion are
highlighted in red in the paper.
Reviewer #2:
<comments> The manuscript (ID: RSOS-180025) entitled “Factors
Affecting N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) Formation From
polyDADMAC Degradation During Chloramination” is interesting
and in my opinion important in its field. The authors explain carefully
the experimental procedures, the aim and significance of the work is
also explained.
Question 1: My concerns are due the statistical analysis. First is not
described in the materials and methods. The authors indicated that the
detection limits were obtained, they do not indicate how.
Reply: Thanks for reviewer’s suggestion. According to reviewer’s
suggestion, we revised part 2.3.1 and part 2.3.2 to include more details
of detection limits.
Question 2: They also do not indicate the number of replicates used
and the error bars in graphics of figures 2 and 3 accordingly to the
authors’ information are not the result of several replicates.
Reply: Thanks for reviewer’s suggestion. We mentioned in part 2.2
that all the experiments, matrix and reagent controls as well as
duplicate experiments were conducted for each condition. Also, we
revised the table 2 and 3.
Question 3: The schemes presented in figure 5 should be carefully
revised especially the proposed hydrolysis of an imine.
Reply: Considering the Reviewer’s suggestion, we revised figure 5.
We hope that revised version of the manuscript is now acceptable for
publication in your journal. At last, thanks very much for all of your
help and your time.
Best wishes,
Your sincerely
