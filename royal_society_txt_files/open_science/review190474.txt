This is an interesting study that seeks to explore the connection between personality traits and
sperm traits and establishes a link with post mating mate selection. The study finds a weak
correlation between sperm number and boldness in males, but not exploration behavior. I suggest
to replace the reported r with r-squared and to discuss that not much of the underlying
variability is explained. Overall, however, the paper opens a door into a novel approach of
investigating and understanding personality traits. I hope there is more to come!

This manuscript addresses the literature gap found between personality traits and post-mating
reproductive success, specifically they investigate the relationship between personality traits and
different sperm characteristics. This manuscript was well written and to the point. However,
there are some minor corrections I would suggest and questions I have about the study.
First, very simple to correct are minor grammar corrections:
Line 17: comma needed after "hence"
Line 30: comma needed after "aggressiveness"
Line 33: commas needed before and after "in particular"
Line 38: delete "a" found before "resource"
Line 40-42: In this sentence you mention that this often comes at the cost of increased mortality
3
and you follow this by giving 3 examples that have nothing to do with mortality but instead are
examples of the previous sentence. Is line 40-42 necessary or is there a way to help clarify this up?
Line 68: comma needed after "behavioural"
Line 72-77: This sentence is hard to follow, I would suggest that you try to break it into two so
that your reader isn't confused at the end of the paragraph.
Result section: I'm trying to understand why the p-values here don't match up with the ones in
the table. You say it confirms your LMM results, but I'm not sure where they come from. Is the
table from the LMMs and the ones reported in lines 148-149 from a regression? I'm confused,
maybe it is me not completely following you statistical approach...
Line 162: commas needed around "therefore"
Discussion: Boldness is a very vague term, in your methods you define it as the time it takes a
male to emerge from a refuge into a novel environment. But then throughout the discussion, you
refer to boldness in males as his likeliness to approach predators or associated in some form with
predation. Are these two definitions of boldness correlated and would the later definition also be
correlated with sperm number? I think you are making an assumption here that may or may not
be supported by your data. For instance, you may be "bold" when exploring a new environment,
but you may not be bold when presented with an actual predator. Unless you can connect the
two different definitions of boldness to one another, I think you should present this caveat in the
discussion.

revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
5
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science charge article processing charges for all new
submissions that are accepted for publication. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to
Royal Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers
submitted as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry

R: We thank the reviewer for his/her positive feedback. We agree with him/her that, although
ificant, the among-individual variability in boldness explained by sperm number is relatively low,
the p-value from the correlation coefficient just below the significance threshold (p=0.046, Fig 1).

R: We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comment. We note that the personality field has
ely suffered from terminology issues until very recently, with the same behavioural trait called with
rent terms and different behavioural traits called with the same term. Recent work (see for example
]) have recommended using a simplified terminology for animal personality traits that is now widely
pted in the animal personality field. This approach relies on the ‘Big Five’ animal personality traits
, boldness, exploration, activity, aggressiveness, and sociability) in which terms represent categories
aits instead of specific behavioural traits. Since our study overlaps the animal personality and the
-copulatory sexual selection research fields, we wanted to minimize potential issues related to the
of ambiguous terminology and, therefore, we have followed the conservative approach indicated by
e et al. 2007 [2] and used the general category term “boldness” and “exploration” instead of more
ific descriptive terms. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that the terminology used here
uld account for different backgrounds of the audience and, therefore, we further clarified this in the
(see L 184-185 of the revised manuscript).
