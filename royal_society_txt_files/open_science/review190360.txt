This study investigated that PIC inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone
resorption by suppressing MAPK, NF-<U+03BA>B and AKT signaling pathways and promoted caspase3-
mediated apoptosis of mature osteoclasts. The previous study declared that PIC inhibits the NF-
<U+03BA>B, MAPK and PI3K pathways. PIC also inhibits the formation of osteoclasts (doi: 10.1096/fj;
doi: 10.1016/j), so the innovation of this research is relatively insufficient. At the same time, some
problems should be addressed in this study.
Major concerns:
1. The osteoclastogenesis assay not only implemented by RAW264.7 cells, but also should use
BMMCs.
2. The toxicity of PIC on RAW264.7 cells should be declared. In Figure 5A, the TRAP staining
showed that number of osteoclasts were decreased by PIC, it also may be caused by toxic effect of
PIC.
3. The Figure 5 showed that PIC promoted apoptosis of osteoclasts and decreases the number of
osteoclasts. Please explain that why the number of osteoclasts not change in cell viability assay
(Figure 1B & C).
Minor concerns:
1. The negative control group should be added in Figure 1D.
2. The TRAF6 trigger NF-<U+03BA>B, MAPK pathway, and the C-Src trigger PI3K pathway. (line 52-58)

The submitted manuscript claims to treat the bone-destructive diseases by naturally occurring
organic polyphenolic stilbene compound called Piceatannol. This compound is present in many
foods as a strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect. There was no toxicity effect of
Piceatannol on RAW264.7 cells insisting its safe to use them as a drug to inhibit the osteoclast
formation and bone resorption. Piceatannol successfully suppressed the MAPK, NF-<U+03BA>B and AKT
signaling pathway which considered to be a major molecular pathway in osteoclast formation
and bone resorption. Further, it induces apoptosis in mature osteoclast by caspases 3 dependent
pathway. Overall, the research article nearly covers all the significant area which is required to
address to treat the bone-destructive diseases.
1)I highly recommend this research article to be accepted.
2)The research article clearly depicts the importance of the Piceatannol in treating bone-
destructive diseases by covering most significant research area
3)The research article is novel because it uses the naturally occurring compound to treat bone
disease with no cytotoxicity effect
4)The minor suggestion is to write a conclusion in the end also discussion part can be written
more accurately

Appendix A
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our
manuscript entitled “Piceatannol Attenuates RANKL-Induced Osteoclast
Differentiation and Bone Resorption by Suppressing MAPK , NF-<U+03BA>B and AKT
Signaling pathways and Promotes Caspase3-Mediated Apoptosis of Mature
Osteoclasts”. Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and
improving our paper. The main corrections in the paper and the responds to the
reviewer’s comments are as flowing:
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Reviewer comment 1: The osteoclastogenesis assay not only implemented by
RAW264.7 cells, but also should use BMMCs.
Author reply: Thank you for your great suggestion. We are deeply aware of the
necessity of both RAW264.7 cells and BMMCs for osteoclastogenesis research. Due to
lack of time, I cannot do the additional experiment on BMMCs but I will consider your
precious advice in future for my experiments.
Reviewer comment 2: The toxicity of PIC on RAW264.7 cells should be declared. In
Figure 5A, the TRAP staining showed that number of osteoclasts were decreased by
PIC, it also may be caused by toxic effect of PIC.
Author reply: Thank you for your advice. It was our negligence that we didn’t explore
the minimum concentration of PIC which caused toxicity. As we mentioned in section
2.1 and 2.2, PIC was dissolved in DMSO and stored at -20°in a concentration of 50mM.
Thus, the maximum concentration used in our subsequent experiments couldn’t exceed
50µM to insure the highest concentration of DMSO was below 0.1% during the
experiments. However, we have done Pre-Experiments several times to insure that the
maximum concentration we could use (50µM) showed no cytotoxic effects in
RAW264.7 cells (supplemental Fig1). Considering the above reasons, we finally use
40µM as the maximum concentration.
As we mentioned in section 3.5—“We found that PIC treatment attenuated the survival
of mature osteoclasts in a dose-dependent manner(Figure 5A, B). To investigate
whether the decrease in mature osteoclast survival was accompanied by apoptosis,
LDH release for cell necrosis and Hoechst 33258 staining for nuclear
fragmentation were performed as described in the methods. As shown in Figure 5C,
mature osteoclasts didn’t release significant LDH after 24h exposure to PIC. On the
other hand, an increasing nuclear fragmentation was observed in the PIC treated cells
compared to the control, indicating that PIC treatment enhanced apoptosis of mature
osteoclasts.(Figure 5D). Consistent with its pro-apoptotic effect, addition of PIC
increased caspase-3 activity and induced the cleavage of the caspase-3 precursor
(Figure 5E, F).”, the number of mature osteoclasts were decreased by PIC was due to
apoptosis shown by LDH release assay,Hoechst 33258 staining ,Caspase-3 activity
assay and Caspase-3 protein expression.
Reviewer comment 3: The Figure 5 showed that PIC promoted apoptosis of osteoclasts
and decreases the number of osteoclasts. Please explain that why the number of
osteoclasts not change in cell viability assay (Figure 1B & C)
Author reply: Thank you for your good comments. Figure 1B&C only represent the
cell viability of RAW264.7 cells rather than the mature osteoclasts. As we mentioned
in section 2.8—“RAW264.7 cells were cultured in DMEM complete medium
supplemented with RANKL (20ng/ml) and M-CSF (10ng/ml)] for 4 days to
differentiate into mature osteoclasts”, our results showed that PIC had no effect on the
cell viability of RAW264.7 cells, but when RAW264.7 cells differentiated into mature
osteoclasts, it induced apoptosis of mature osteoclasts.
Reviewer comment 4: The negative control group should be added in Figure 1D
Author reply: Thank you for your mention. We added the negative control group in
supplementary data (supplemental Fig2).
Reviewer comment 5: The TRAF6 trigger NF-<U+03BA>B, MAPK pathway, and the C-Src
trigger PI3K pathway. (line 52-58)
Author reply: Thank you for your great suggestion. We are very sorry for our incorrect
writing “which then triggers the activation of several downstream signaling pathways
including NF-<U+03BA>B, MAPKs(ERK, JNK and p38) and PI3K/AKT”. It is noteworthy that
several reviews report that Src/PI3K/AKT pathway is one of the downstream signaling
pathways of RANKL/RANK/TRAF6 (DOI: 10.1038/nature01658; DOI:
10.1016/S0006-291X(03)00695-8; DOI: 10.1016/j.intimp.2016.04.024). In view of
this, we modified the sentence into “which then activates several downstream signaling
pathways including NF-<U+03BA>B, MAPKs(ERK, JNK and p38) and Src/PI3K/AKT”.
Special thanks to you for your good comments.
