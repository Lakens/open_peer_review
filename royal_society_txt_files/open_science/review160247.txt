Dear Author,
I find your work on the lack of innovation in novel tasks in grackles very interesting. It questions
the assumption that behavioural flexibility and innovation can be used as interchangeable terms
and helps to understand the multi-faceted nature of behavioural flexibility which opens up
exciting future research avenues. There are, however, three points I would like you to address:
A) Stone dropping experiment. This experiment is described elsewhere and should therefore be
removed from Methods and Results. I do however think the results of this experiment can be a
useful addition to the general discussion.
B) The methods section can be improved by adding more information about i) the experimental
procedures and ii) the underlying rationale. I believe there were good reasons for all of this, but
at first these are not always clear.
i. For example: how often did habituation (line 158, 200) and experimental trials (line 159, line
167, line 172-175, line 182, line 207) take place, i.e. how much time did pass between individual
trials? This is important to know to understand if other reasons (e.g. lack of food motivation)
could explain the results.
ii. For example: line 163/176: why would successful tool users have had 15 more trials, if the
objective of this experiment was to confirm that they innovated stick tool use?
3
Line 203/226: why are trials for stone dropping and stick tool use 5 min long, but trials for
horizontal string pulling only 3 minutes and for vertical string pulling 20 minutes?
C) The discussion needs to be broadened considerably. The new results are discussed in detail
and also compared to the results from other species, but there is no discussion about where these
differences might come from. It would also be interesting to discuss the difference in quality of
behavioural actions between the experiments (e.g. interaction, but unsuccessful in experiment 2
and no interaction in experiment 3). The implications of your findings should be put in a more
general context and linked back to examples from the literature, e.g. where behavioural flexibility
and innovation has been used interchangeably.
Here are a few additional comments:
Line 50: spell out which aspects exactly, all three experiments here test if grackles invent new
behaviours (line 63)
Line 59: add 'some' or make it more clear that grackles as a species are capable of showing
behavioural flexibility in these tasks, but that there is large variation between individuals
Line 75: in comparison to? (other species that have been tested on this task?)
Line 77: see comment above. None of the other species would have experienced this task in the
wild.
Line 80: define ‘true tools’
Line 99: elaborate on the reason behind this prediction. The current phrasing suggests this
prediction would hold true for all species
Line 119: were they visually isolated at all times?
Line 141: why did the stone dropping experiment not involve a similar habituation period to the
apparatus as the other two experiments?
Line 197/198: immediately or within a certain time period?
Line 200: how long did a habituation trial last for?

label_comment_3
Dear Author,
I am very pleased to see how the previous feedback was implemented in your revised
manuscript. However, I would still like to address some minor points (see my comments below).
Backround
Lines 103 and 104: It seems that these tool use reports are from primates and dolphins (“objects
are held in the hand or mouth”, “hammers, sponges”), not birds as stated at the beginning of the
sentence.
Methods
Line 164: “(…) because birds were allowed to peck holes…” would sound better.
Line 166: A copyright mark is missing when describing a commercially bought bird food. Also a
clarification whether it was a seed mix, pressed granules etc would be helpful.
Line 170: When rolling in the experimental table, was the human experimenter also entering the
aviary?
Line 171: If a human had to enter the experimental aviary, the wild grackles could still be
stressed. It’s different to be habituated to humans in a city vs in a small enclosure.
Line 174: Was the experimenter visible to the subject during testing?
Line 204: The tool use apparatus is also similar in design to the crevice platforms used in an
ontogeny study on New Caledonian crows (Kenward et al, 2006;
doi:10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.04.007). Which aspects of the methods/procedure from Auersperg et
al were followed? The referred study used a different apparatus and different ghost control
experimental conditions.
Line 244: The different types of strings were not introduced before. Re-phrasing this sentence into
"(…) to two different types of strings (description below) by tying…" would make it easier to
follow.
Line 269: Were the cups always red or was the colour important? The colour is only mentioned
here and not before in Line 249 where the use of cups is introduced.
Line 288: A comma or a semicolon (without "grackles" capitalized) would be more appropriate to
separate the two sentences inside the parentheses.
Line 293: Changing part of this sentence into “(…) made contact with the object or food reward”
would make it easier to understand the procedure.
7
Results
Lines 340 and 341: It is very strange that three individuals didn't pass the habituation/eat the
bait. Did they differ in any way (more shy/neophobic etc) from the other subjects?
Discussion
Line 353: The sex effect reference to Auersperg et al (2014) study is confusing as both female and
male grackles interacted with the stick tool (data presented in Table 1).
Line 359: Goffin’s cockatoos are likely to be feeding generalists, however currently we don't have
literature evidence from the field to support this claim (see Auersperg et al, 2011, page 2, last
paragraph of section "Subjects").
Line 363: Could grackles’ failure to persist also stem from not being able to see the reward inside
the slot apparatus (lacking large enough binocular overlap)? A slightly more detailed discussion
of potential bill shape and vision effects on tool use capacity in grackles should include a study
by Troscianko et al (2012, doi: 10.1038/ncomms2111) about New Caledonian crows’ tool adapted
bill morphology and binocular vision.
Line 364: For an interesting example of “awkward” stick tool use that could be added here, see
the multi-access box study by Auersperg et al, 2011 (doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0020231) where all
keas attempted to use stick tools but only one succeeded (ergonomically stick tool use is difficult
for keas).
Line 403: One rook was also suggested to spontaneously drop a stone into the tube apparatus,
however social influence cannot be excluded (Bird and Emery, 2009; doi:
10.1073/pnas.0901008106).
Line 424: I would re-phrase the last part of this sentence to something like: "species not known to
use tools in the wild". There are anecdotal reports from the field of stick tool using keas
(http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/10417383/Sticky-beak-is-New-Zealands-tooled-up-kea) and
currently we don't know enough about the Goffin ecology and behaviour in the wild to exclude
any potential tool use in this species.
Lines 436 and 437: Transition between these two paragraphs could be improved.
Line 466: "from grassy and recently plowed areas" sounds better than “from grassy areas and
recently plowed areas”.

Dear Author,
I enjoyed reading your resubmitted manuscript. The re-write of introduction and discussion
greatly enhanced the conciseness, ease to read and put the results in a more general context and
the revisions resulted in a much clearer, more detailed and reproducible methods section. This is
a useful contribution to the literature of behavioural flexibility and innovativeness.
A few very minor things (line numbers refer to the track changed version):
Line 65: I believe this is meant to say multi-faceted
Line 115-116: Clarify that this refers to the experiment described in this manuscript. The current
phrasing (as it is part of the general introduction) could be misread as if this would be the case in
the wild.
Line 300: The experiment numbers in the video clips do not longer correspond to the experiment
numbers in the manuscript. If possible, remove the stone dropping clip from the video.
Best wishes.

Appendix 1
Review of “How far will a behaviourally flexible invasive bird go to innovate?”
Manuscript ID: RSOS-160159
The submitted manuscript was interesting to read as it addressed the question of whether a
behaviourally flexible bird species is also innovative in solving novel problem tasks. The posed question
is of high value to the field of animal innovations and the style of the paper was easy to follow. A big
advantage of the presented work is the use of multiple different tests, such as implementing both
horizontal and vertical string pulling problem tasks. However, the manuscript would benefit greatly from
enhancing the introduction and discussion of the results.
Below are my detailed comments on each section of the manuscript.
Introduction
General: More information about grackles’ ecology (such as where they live, what kind of environments
they invaded, what is their social and feeding behaviour) would be very helpful in assessing the Author’s
predictions.
- Line 42: The given definition of behavioural flexibility is somehow confusing. It seems it contains
parts of both the definitions of innovation proposed by Griffin and Guez 2014 (“innovations (…)
ability to invent new behaviours, or use pre-existing ones in new contexts”) and behavioural
flexibility (“Behavioural flexibility, including the ability to change behaviour in response to
environmental feedback, and the ability to inhibit previously successful behaviour”; in: Griffin
and Guez 2014). Following the behavioural flexibility definition Griffin and Guez state that it
“determines the likelihood that new behaviours will emerge, and that pre-existing behaviours
will arise in novel contexts” thus it determines the likelihood of innovations to occur.
Additionally, on page 122 (under headline 2.1) Griffin and Guez state that: “several different
processes should be critical to innovation, including novelty responses, exploration, asocial
learning, and behavioural flexibility”. Therefore, it seems that these authors don’t consider
innovation and behavioural flexibility as synonymous but that behavioural flexibility is one of the
many processes underlying innovation. However, in a recent review by Griffin (Innovativeness as
an emergent property: a new alignment of comparative and experimental research on animal
innovation. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 371: 20150544. http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2015.0544)
“behavioural flexibility” and “innovation” seem to be used as interchangeable terms… More
discussion of the current trends in defining innovation vs behavioural flexibility would be useful.
- Line 58: High invasion rates might not necessarily mean that a species is highly behaviourally
flexible, it depends on the novelty of the new environment (see: Griffin AS. 2016; chapter page
6: “Future directions in determining the ecological correlates of innovativeness”). A brief
description of the environments to which grackles spread and in which aspects they are novel
would be very useful.
- Line 85: A valuable point to add might be that keas which also turn stones (feeding generalist)
are able to learn how to use tools (Auersperg, A. M. I., von Bayern, A. M. P., Gajdon, G. K.,
Huber, L., & Kacelnik, A. (2011). Flexibility in problem solving and tool use of kea and New
Caledonian crows in a multi access box paradigm. PloS One, 6(6), e20231.
doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0020231). More information about whether grackles are also feeding
generalists would be useful to assess the ultimate ecological mechanisms at play.
Methods
- Line 119: Could individual housing caused stress to the birds? More information about their

- Line 137: Was it preferred food or just any food from their daily diet? Information about the
preferred food/reward would be useful to predict their motivation for participating in testing.

span, motivation levels, or whether they need to overcome initial neophobia when faced with
an experimental situation (even after being habituated to the setup)?
- Line 156: Was there a reason that different rewards were used in training (peanuts) and tests
(bread)? Wouldn’t peanuts be a better reward also in testing?

often neophobic towards long hanging strings and various habituation protocols were used to
overcome this response (see for example: Heinrich, B. and Bugnyar, T. (2005), Testing Problem

lost interest?
Discussion
General: This paper would benefit from adding a discussion about the grackles’ ecology, neophobia,
and motivation and how these might limit/confound their innovativeness.
Discussion of a potential age effect (see: Greenberg, R. (2012). The Role of Neophobia and Neophilia
in the Development of Innovative Behaviour of Birds. Animal Innovation.
doi:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198526223.003.0008, page 184, “Uncurious adults”) and possible
factors influencing the grackles’ performance in tests would be also welcome (e.g. for factors
influencing performance in string pulling tasks see: Jacobs, I. F., & Osvath, M. (2015). The string-
pulling paradigm in comparative psychology. Journal of Comparative Psychology, 129(2), 89–120.
doi:10.1037/a0038746). Maybe grackles are not as behaviourally flexible as was hypothesised in the
previous study, or their flexibility is limited to certain contexts?
Also, it would be valuable to discuss how the fact that 2 out of 3 tasks used in this study required
tool use from a non-tool using bird species could have influenced the results (see: Griffin 2016:
“species that uses tools in the first place also has a greater knowledge base in the physical domain
and broader skill set from which to invent new technical innovations through small behavioural
variations”). Do these results provide a suggestion that tool use cannot be predicted by phylogeny
only but rather by also looking at certain ecological circumstances in which tool use would be
adaptive to evolve? An additional discussion of the ecology of grackles and why they don’t seem to
need to use sticks for foraging would be welcome (see: Seed, A., & Byrne, R. (2010). Animal tool-use.
Current Biology, 20(23), R1032–R1039. doi:10.1016/j.cub.2010.09.042, headline: “Tools and
Evolution”). In general, the discussion of potential reasons why the grackles failed to use sticks and
pull strings could be much improved.
- Table 1: Grackles needed large number of trials for training of dropping stones inside the tube
apparatus. A discussion of how behavioural flexibility is/is not influenced by learning abilities
would be informative in interpreting this result.
- Line 278: Why should a social learning condition work for grackles, do we know anything about
their social learning/socio-ecology in the wild?
- Line 306: The references given here are quite old and coming from the same author (Lefebvre).
A more modern and varied review of innovation and behavioural flexibility definitions would be
useful to evaluate the Author’s proposal of not treating the innovation and flexibility as the
same (see also a similar comment in the Introduction section).
- Line 309: As the reference about grackles’ foraging behaviour is a book from 1954 (not easily
accessible), it would be nice to have some of the various feeding strategies listed here.

VIEWER 1
submitted manuscript was interesting to read as it addressed the question of whether a
aviourally flexible bird species is also innovative in solving novel problem tasks. The posed
stion is of high value to the field of animal innovations and the style of the paper was easy to
ow. A big advantage of the presented work is the use of multiple different tests, such as
lementing both horizontal and vertical string pulling problem tasks. However, the manuscript
uld benefit greatly from enhancing the introduction and discussion of the results.
> Thank you!
oduction
neral: More information about grackles’ ecology (such as where they live, what kind of
ironments they invaded, what is their social and feeding behaviour) would be very helpful in
essing the Author’s predictions.
> I added more about their social and foraging behaviour and where they live (line 74-77,
-166) to the introduction, and more about what environments they invaded in response to one
our comments below.
Line 42: The given definition of behavioural flexibility is somehow confusing. It seems it
contains parts of both the definitions of innovation proposed by Griffin and Guez 2014
(“innovations (...) ability to invent new behaviours, or use pre-existing ones in new
contexts”) and behavioural flexibility (“Behavioural flexibility, including the ability to
change behaviour in response to environmental feedback, and the ability to inhibit
previously successful behaviour”; in: Griffin and Guez 2014). Following the behavioural
flexibility definition Griffin and Guez state that it “determines the likelihood that new
behaviours will emerge, and that pre-existing behaviours will arise in novel contexts”
thus it determines the likelihood of innovations to occur. Additionally, on page 122
(under headline 2.1) Griffin and Guez state that: “several different processes should be
critical to innovation, including novelty responses, exploration, asocial learning, and
behavioural flexibility”. Therefore, it seems that these authors don’t consider innovation
and behavioural flexibility as synonymous but that behavioural flexibility is one of the
many processes underlying innovation. However, in a recent review by Griffin
(Innovativeness as an emergent property: a new alignment of comparative and
experimental research on animal innovation. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 371: 20150544.
http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2015.0544) “behavioural flexibility” and “innovation”
seem to be used as interchangeable terms... More discussion of the current trends in
defining innovation vs behavioural flexibility would be useful.
> That is an excellent clarification, thank you. I think I unknowingly combined the
nitions for innovation and behavioural flexibility (which, after re-reading, are clearly
arate in Griffin and Guez 2014) because so often in the literature “innovation” is used
rchangeably with “behavioural flexibility”. I have now updated the introduction to separate
se terms as outlined in the Griffin & Guez paper and I contrasted this definition with previous
nitions that treat the terms synonymously and placed this in the context of experimental
ults (lines 58-69).
Line 58: High invasion rates might not necessarily mean that a species is highly
behaviourally flexible, it depends on the novelty of the new environment (see: Griffin
AS. 2016; chapter page 6: “Future directions in determining the ecological correlates of
innovativeness”). A brief description of the environments to which grackles spread and in
which aspects they are novel would be very useful.
> Yes, I have been thinking about this too. In introduced species, the new environment might
so similar to their previous environment that no flexibility is needed – they are already
pted. Native species that expand their range might do so because more of their suitable
itat is created or because they change their behaviour to access new niches. In the case of the
at-tailed grackle, their suitable habitat (urban, grassy, and agricultural environments) has
anded as humans have. I have added a note about this and I discuss what aspects might have
n novel at some point in their history (lines 79-109).
Line 85: A valuable point to add might be that keas which also turn stones (feeding
generalist) are able to learn how to use tools (Auersperg, A. M. I., von Bayern, A. M. P.,
Gajdon, G. K., Huber, L., & Kacelnik, A. (2011). Flexibility in problem solving and tool
use of kea and New Caledonian crows in a multi access box paradigm. PloS One, 6(6),
e20231. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0020231). More information about whether grackles
are also feeding generalists would be useful to assess the ultimate ecological mechanisms
at play.
> Great point, thank you! I added the kea example and that keas and grackles are generalist
agers (lines 125-159).
thods
Line 119: Could individual housing caused stress to the birds? More information about their
social ecology is needed to appropriately evaluate the methods.
> Initially, this was a concern of mine because I am used to working with long-term
nogamous corvids. However, when I started observing the grackles in the field, I noticed that
y did not have many affiliative behaviours (no allopreening, they rarely sit in proximity of
h other) and they foraged in small groups that were loosely arranged. Later, when I brought
m into the aviaries, I had planned on housing them together when they were not being tested,
ever they looked comfortable housed individually and I let them peck holes in the tarps at the
k of their aviary so they could see each other (but not the testing section of the other’s
ary). If I put them in the same aviary, there were extensive displacements and aggression such
t I did not feel comfortable leaving them alone, so I kept them housed individually because it
eared less stressful. I added that this species is not monogamous and has weak social bonds,
ch is reported in the literature (lines 206-213).
Line 121: Was their exploration behaviour/motivation measured?
>> This text has been removed per comment A from Reviewer 2 below. Now the stone
pping experiment is only in the discussion because the data and results exist in a previous
lication. Their exploration, risk aversion, neophobia, and motor diversity were examined
ugh not during stone dropping training) and related to behavioural flexibility in a
nuscript that is in preparation for submission.
Line 137: Was it preferred food or just any food from their daily diet? Information about the
preferred food/reward would be useful to predict their motivation for participating in
testing.
> This text has been removed per comment A from Reviewer 2 below. Now the stone
pping experiment is only in the discussion because the data and results exist in a previous
lication. Good point though and it is clarified in the PeerJ manuscript where this data is
lished (the food was bread and/or peanuts so it was their preferred food that was only
ilable during testing, not their maintenance diet).
Line 141: These seem like very short testing trials. Is there any data about grackles attention
span, motivation levels, or whether they need to overcome initial neophobia when faced
with an experimental situation (even after being habituated to the setup)?
> This text has been removed per comment A from Reviewer 2 below. Now the stone
pping experiment is only in the discussion because the data and results exist in a previous
lication. To answer your question, there is nothing published on their attention span or
ivation levels because this species has never been tested in this way before. The spontaneous
ne dropping trials were the same length as had been used on other species and they were
rt to avoid extinguishing the bird’s interest in the apparatus entirely. They were habituated to
apparatus before the spontaneous stone dropping trials so their lack of innovation was likely
due to neophobia.
Line 156: Was there a reason that different rewards were used in training (peanuts) and tests
(bread)? Wouldn’t peanuts be a better reward also in testing?
> There was no particular reason that the habituation trial had a piece of peanut rather than
mall piece of bread. Grackles liked both bread and peanuts and would work for both, with
ferences sometimes appearing to change over time (I didn’t measure this though). Bread was
d for tool use testing because each piece could be made into a large size that blocked most of
opening, which would make its extraction with the stick easier. I removed bread and peanuts
m the list of foods they were fed in an unrestricted way and noted that these two foods were
d during testing (lines 213-216).
Line 181: I assume the grackles were habituated to a human presence prior to the social
learning condition. It would be nice to see a one sentence description about the
subjects’ experience with humans.
> The grackles were habituated to humans in general, and also their first 5 days in the aviary
e spent habituating them to humans just outside their aviary door. I added the suggested
cription (lines 218-223).
Line 198: Stylistics - “they were fed their dinner off of the inner table” was a bit confusing
to read.
>> I clarified the sentence (line 340).
Line 220: Was it an appropriate habituation for the strings? In previous experiments birds
were often neophobic towards long hanging strings and various habituation protocols
were used to overcome this response (see for example: Heinrich, B. and Bugnyar, T.
(2005), Testing Problem Solving in Ravens: String-Pulling to Reach Food. Ethology,
111: 962–976. doi: 10.1111/j.1439- 0310.2005.01133.x). Results
>>> I used Heinrich & Bugnyar (2005) as the basis for my habituation protocols,
ch I noted on lines 310-311, and I have added more detail about how the grackles were
ituated to strings (lines 369-371). The grackles behaved similarly to most of the ravens in
nrich & Bugnyar (2005), even after both species had gone through habituation: They were
phobic of the strings hanging with objects attached (ravens “hesitatingly sidled up to the
ng and quickly jumped back after pecking it”, pp.967-968). The difference between the
cies is that apparently the ravens eventually habituated to the set up (because all of them
ved it) at some point after the experiments started (so some experimental time must have been
oted to habituation), whereas most grackles didn’t. Perhaps grackles were less motivated
/or persistent in attempting to overcome their neophobia or, for those who were not
phobic, innovate the correct solution. I added this to the discussion and included the
rence to Jacobs & Osvath 2015 (lines 515-523).
- Line 234: No birds dropped stones inside the tube but what was their behaviour, did
they manipulate the stones, were they active around the apparatus or not active at
all?
> This text has been removed per comment A from Reviewer 2 below. Now the stone
pping experiment is only in the discussion because the data and results exist in a previous
lication. They were active around the apparatus, walking around inspecting it from all
les, and 5 picked up and moved the stones or manipulated them.
- Line 238: After the subjects pulled the stick out of the apparatus, did they continue to
interact with it or lost interest?
> I expanded the details on the range of interactions with the stick and noted that they lost
rest in the stick after the interaction (lines 396-398).
Discussion General: This paper would benefit from adding a discussion about the
grackles’ ecology, neophobia, and motivation and how these might
limit/confound their innovativeness. Discussion of a potential age effect (see:
Greenberg, R. (2012). The Role of Neophobia and Neophilia in the Development
of Innovative Behaviour of Birds. Animal Innovation.
doi:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198526223.003.0008, page 184, “Uncurious adults”)
and possible factors influencing the grackles’ performance in tests would be also
welcome (e.g. for factors influencing performance in string pulling tasks see:

psychology. Journal of Comparative Psychology, 129(2), 89–120.

hypothesised in the previous study, or their flexibility is limited to certain
contexts?
> I added to the discussion: a comparison between grackles and Goffin cockatoos regarding
l use and factors that might differ between grackles and other species that were successful
es 454-488), age effects and neophilia with references to their ecology (lines 565-573). See
response to the comment starting with “Line 220”for a description of how I incorporated
ivation and persistence (including referencing Jacobs & Osvath 2015) into the discussion. I
rified that the innovation results do not call into question previous behavioural flexibility
ults because these two traits are independent (lines 539-545).
o, it would be valuable to discuss how the fact that 2 out of 3 tasks used in this study required
l use from a non-tool using bird species could have influenced the results (see: Griffin 2016:
ecies that uses tools in the first place also has a greater knowledge base in the physical

VIEWER 2
ar Author,
nd your work on the lack of innovation in novel tasks in grackles very interesting. It questions
assumption that behavioural flexibility and innovation can be used as interchangeable terms
helps to understand the multi-faceted nature of behavioural flexibility which opens up
iting future research avenues. There are, however, three points I would like you to address:
> Thank you!
Stone dropping experiment. This experiment is described elsewhere and should therefore be
oved from Methods and Results. I do however think the results of this experiment can be a
ful addition to the general discussion.
> I had debated about this so I am glad you have a clear opinion on what to do with the
vious findings. I removed stone dropping from the introduction, methods, and results, and I
hrased it in the discussion and abstract.
The methods section can be improved by adding more information about i) the experimental
cedures and ii) the underlying rationale. I believe there were good reasons for all of this, but
irst these are not always clear.
> I addressed your two comments on this topic below and also implemented an additional
rification:
rizontal string pulling: if a bird did not come to the table in 3 min, a break was given (lasting
m 5 min to 3 days) and the next trial was preceded by a habituation trial. Also, habituation
restarted if the bird appeared to be having a neophobic reaction (lines 348-352).
or example: how often did habituation (line 158, 200) and experimental trials (line 159, line
, line 172-175, line 182, line 207) take place, i.e. how much time did pass between individual
ls? This is important to know to understand if other reasons (e.g. lack of food motivation)
ld explain the results.
> I explained that the vertical string habituation trials ranged between 3-8 for those birds
t never passed (Refresco=3 sessions in 1 day, Batido=3 sessions in 2 days, Margarita=5
sions in 9 days, Michelada=8 sessions in 9 days), and between 1-2 trials for birds that passed
moved onto the experimental trials (Cerveza and Horchata=1 session in 1 day, Tequila=2
sions in 2 days) (lines 374-377). I added that the horizontal string habituation trials ranged
ween 2-6 sessions in 2-5 days for birds that passed (Batido=2 sessions in 3 days, Horchata=3
sions in 3 days, Refresco=2 sessions in 2 days, Michelada 5 sessions in 2 days, Tequila=4
sions in 3 days, Margarita=3 sessions in 2 days, Cerveza=6 sessions in 5 days). Jugo didn’t
s habituation, but he only got 1 session in 1 day because I ran out of time and needed to
ase them (lines 336-338). I explained that tool use experimental trials began immediately
r passing habituation (line 278), that tool use experimental trials were given one immediately
r the other (lines 288-289, 294, 310), and that horizontal string pulling trials could occur one
ediately after the other or on consecutive days (lines 352).
or example: line 163/176: why would successful tool users have had 15 more trials, if the
ective of this experiment was to confirm that they innovated stick tool use?
> I added that 15 more trials were conducted to determine whether the bird’s success was
to chance or whether it could consistently solve the task (lines 282-284).
e 203/226: why are trials for stone dropping and stick tool use 5 min long, but trials for
izontal string pulling only 3 minutes and for vertical string pulling 20 minutes?
> I added that I based the methods for each experiment on previous studies that had been
ducted on other species to make the grackle results comparable (lines 227-228, 314-315).
methods for stone dropping were removed per your comment A.
The discussion needs to be broadened considerably. The new results are discussed in detail
also compared to the results from other species, but there is no discussion about where these
erences might come from. It would also be interesting to discuss the difference in quality of
avioural actions between the experiments (e.g. interaction, but unsuccessful in experiment 2
no interaction in experiment 3). The implications of your findings should be put in a more
eral context and linked back to examples from the literature, e.g. where behavioural
ibility and innovation has been used interchangeably.
> The discussion has been greatly expanded per comments from Reviewer 1, which are in
with your comment here about where these differences might come from (see above
ponses starting at “Discussion General”). I added a discussion about the quality of the
ons in the tool use (lines 481-488) and string pulling experiments (lines 515-523). I added a
tion to the introduction that discusses how empirical findings contradict the idea that
avioural flexibility and innovation are the same trait (lines 58-69), and I linked the
cussion back to the general context that is now more fleshed out in the introduction (lines
-591).
e are a few additional comments:
e 50: spell out which aspects exactly, all three experiments here test if grackles invent new
aviours (line 63)
> This has now been removed after clarifying theory in the introduction per Reviewer 1’s
ments.
e 59: add 'some' or make it more clear that grackles as a species are capable of showing
avioural flexibility in these tasks, but that there is large variation between individuals
> Yes, good point. I changed this (line 109).
e 75: in comparison to? (other species that have been tested on this task?)
> This has now been removed due to the revision from your comment A.
e 77: see comment above. None of the other species would have experienced this task in the
d.
> This has now been removed due to the revision from your comment A.
e 80: define ‘true tools’
> I added a definition on lines 116-117.
e 99: elaborate on the reason behind this prediction. The current phrasing suggests this
diction would hold true for all species
> The species that have exhibited string pulling behaviour are nest building species
luding bumblebees), therefore perhaps this experience gave them the necessary skills to
nsfer to a new context. I expanded on this (lines 177-185).
e 119: were they visually isolated at all times?
> No, they often pecked holes in the tarps that covered the walls for visual isolation during
ing. I allowed holes in the tarps in areas where the adjacent bird would not have visual
ess to the testing part of its neighbours cage. Therefore, they could often see each other at the
k of the aviaries, but not at the front where testing occurred. I clarified this (lines 210-213).
e 141: why did the stone dropping experiment not involve a similar habituation period to the
aratus as the other two experiments?
> They were habituated to the apparatus before the spontaneous stone dropping experiment;
d just forgotten to mention this. However, this has now been removed in response to your
ment A.
e 197/198: immediately or within a certain time period?
> I added that the habituation period started if the bird did not eat the peanut after a few
utes (line 339).
e 200: how long did a habituation trial last for?
> A bird was considered habituated if it ate the peanut within the first minute of the
ituation trial. I added this to line 342.
ure 2: add an introductory sentence to link this figure to the tool use experiment
> I added “To determine whether grackles innovate string pulling behaviour, two string
ling experiments were conducted: Horizontal (A, B, C) and vertical (D)”. I also added a
ilar first sentence to Figure 1 to make them consistent.
le 1: delete stone drop training trials column

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS AND EDITOR
Manuscript ID RSOS-160159
11 May 2016
Dear Andrew Dunn, Kevin Padian, Berenika Mioduszewska, and Reviewer 2,
I am so glad you think my revision was effective! I greatly appreciate your further
comments here, which really helped polish the paper. I have revised the manuscript per
your feedback and I provide responses to each comment below (marked by ‘>>>’ and in
italics). The line numbers refer to the tracked changes version (which are different from
the line numbers in the clean version). Additionally, I added a more nuanced discussion
of how invasion success is predicted to relate with behavioral flexibility in the
Introduction after finding a couple new papers on this topic (L62-66).
Thank you again!
My best,
Corina
REVIEWER 1
I am very pleased to see how the previous feedback was implemented in your revised
manuscript. However, I would still like to address some minor points (see my comments below).
>>> Thank you very much! I’m happy to address your further comments and I appreciate the
time you have taken to help me improve the manuscript!
Backround
Lines 103 and 104: It seems that these tool use reports are from primates and dolphins (“objects
are held in the hand or mouth”, “hammers, sponges”), not birds as stated at the beginning of the
sentence.
>>> Good point. I found text in the reference that specifically refers to birds holding a tool in
the beak or foot and I revised my text (L78-79).
Methods
Line 164: “(…) because birds were allowed to peck holes…” would sound better.
>>> Thanks! I made the change (L140).
Line 166: A copyright mark is missing when describing a commercially bought bird food. Also a
clarification whether it was a seed mix, pressed granules etc would be helpful.
>>> I added a registered trademark after Mazuri and described that they were pressed granules
(L142).
Line 170: When rolling in the experimental table, was the human experimenter also entering the
aviary?
>>> Yes, I noted this (L146).
Line 171: If a human had to enter the experimental aviary, the wild grackles could still be
stressed. It’s different to be habituated to humans in a city vs in a small enclosure.
>>> True. Grackles displayed a range of disturbance upon experimenters entering the aviary,
however all grackles calmed down almost immediately upon the experimenter leaving the aviary
even though the experimenter was still in full view just outside the wire mesh door. I clarified
this on L147-149.
Line 174: Was the experimenter visible to the subject during testing?
>>> Yes, this is noted on L150-151.
Line 204: The tool use apparatus is also similar in design to the crevice platforms used in an
ontogeny study on New Caledonian crows (Kenward et al, 2006;
doi:10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.04.007). Which aspects of the methods/procedure from Auersperg et
al were followed? The referred study used a different apparatus and different ghost control
experimental conditions.
>>> Thanks for pointing out Kenward et al.’s crevice apparatus! I added the reference (L160-
161). I clarified that my trial durations, conditions, and passing criterion were modeled after
Auersperg et al. (L160-161).
Line 244: The different types of strings were not introduced before. Re-phrasing this sentence
into "(…) to two different types of strings (description below) by tying…" would make it easier
to follow.
>>> Good catch! I changed the text as suggested (L204).
Line 269: Were the cups always red or was the colour important? The colour is only mentioned
here and not before in Line 249 where the use of cups is introduced.
>>> The cups were always red so I removed the reference to their color on L230.
Line 288: A comma or a semicolon (without "grackles" capitalized) would be more appropriate
to separate the two sentences inside the parentheses.
>>> I changed it to a semicolon (L250).
Line 293: Changing part of this sentence into “(…) made contact with the object or food reward”
would make it easier to understand the procedure.
>>> Good point. I made the change (L255).
Results
Lines 340 and 341: It is very strange that three individuals didn't pass the habituation/eat the bait.
Did they differ in any way (more shy/neophobic etc) from the other subjects?
>>> Jugo, Batido, and Refresco did not differ consistently from Horchata in exploration
behavior, and Horchata was the most neophobic of the four of them (these results are in a paper
that is in review at PeerJ). The string pulling tests were done near the end of their time in the
aviary, which was near the beginning of the breeding season and the males had begun to
vocalize. Anecdotally, it seemed like they were still willing to participate in experiments that they
were already familiar with, but were less inclined to learn about new experiments as the
breeding season approached. I added a note about this (L302-305).
Discussion
Line 353: The sex effect reference to Auersperg et al (2014) study is confusing as both female
and male grackles interacted with the stick tool (data presented in Table 1).
>>> I eliminated the description of the Goffin cockatoo sex differences to clarify how the
cockatoos are similar to the grackles (L310-311).
Line 359: Goffin’s cockatoos are likely to be feeding generalists, however currently we don't
have literature evidence from the field to support this claim (see Auersperg et al, 2011, page 2,
last paragraph of section "Subjects").
>>> Thanks for the reference and for clarifying what is and is not known about the Goffin’s
cockatoos. I have the Auersperg et al. 2014 reference in there because I think I had seen her side
note in the Subjects section (L315).
Line 363: Could grackles’ failure to persist also stem from not being able to see the reward
inside the slot apparatus (lacking large enough binocular overlap)? A slightly more detailed
discussion of potential bill shape and vision effects on tool use capacity in grackles should
include a study by Troscianko et al (2012, doi: 10.1038/ncomms2111) about New Caledonian
crows’ tool adapted bill morphology and binocular vision.
>>> Good idea to give a bit more detail here and to cite Trocianko et al. (2012) (L320-326).
Line 364: For an interesting example of “awkward” stick tool use that could be added here, see
the multi-access box study by Auersperg et al, 2011 (doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0020231) where
all keas attempted to use stick tools but only one succeeded (ergonomically stick tool use is
difficult for keas).
>>> Interesting, I hadn’t realized that paper hypothesized about bill morphology as well. I
added a note about this on L325-326.
Line 403: One rook was also suggested to spontaneously drop a stone into the tube apparatus,
however social influence cannot be excluded (Bird and Emery, 2009; doi:
10.1073/pnas.0901008106).
>>> I didn’t realize this; thanks for pointing it out. I amended the sentence (L367-369).
Line 424: I would re-phrase the last part of this sentence to something like: "species not known
to use tools in the wild". There are anecdotal reports from the field of stick tool using keas
(http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/10417383/Sticky-beak-is-New-Zealands-tooled-up-kea) and
currently we don't know enough about the Goffin ecology and behaviour in the wild to exclude
any potential tool use in this species.
>>> I made the suggested change (L393).
Lines 436 and 437: Transition between these two paragraphs could be improved.
>>> I added a concluding sentence to smooth the transition (L406-407).
Line 466: "from grassy and recently plowed areas" sounds better than “from grassy areas and
recently plowed areas”.
>>> I made the suggested change (L430).
REVIEWER 2
I enjoyed reading your resubmitted manuscript. The re-write of introduction and discussion
greatly enhanced the conciseness, ease to read and put the results in a more general context and
the revisions resulted in a much clearer, more detailed and reproducible methods section. This is
a useful contribution to the literature of behavioural flexibility and innovativeness.
>>> Thank you so much!
A few very minor things (line numbers refer to the track changed version):
Line 65: I believe this is meant to say multi-faceted
>>> Good catch! I made the change (L51).
Line 115-116: Clarify that this refers to the experiment described in this manuscript. The current
phrasing (as it is part of the general introduction) could be misread as if this would be the case in
the wild.
>>> I made the clarification (L92).
Line 300: The experiment numbers in the video clips do not longer correspond to the experiment
numbers in the manuscript. If possible, remove the stone dropping clip from the video.
>>> I revised the video to match the revised paper and I will re-upload it when I have more
details about the citation to include at the end.
