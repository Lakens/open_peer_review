In this manuscript, Xia and coworkers reported the use of hPDI2-CN2 as acceptor in OSCs. The
fabricated devices show PCE of 1.42 - 2.76 % after thermal annealing or 1, 8 diiodoctane additive
treatment. The manuscript is well written and easy to follow.
The concept is not completely novel and an extension of earlier work by Nukolls and coworkers
(JACS, 2014, 136, 15215-15221). In this paper, the authors used hPDI2CN2 as an acceptor
molecule instead of hPDI2. However, the low yield of hPDI2CN2 (~28 %) and low PCE values of
fabricated devices (compared to the earlier works; JACS, 2014, 136, 15215-15221 and Nat. Comm.
2015, 6, 8242) reduces the impact of the work a bit.
Comment:
1. In the introduction, the authors need to discuss the initial motivation of introducing CN groups
in PDI2.
2. ESI: Synthesis of hPDI2CN2 part is not well written. [such as 1) how much mmol of hPDI2Br2
and CuCN were taken. 3) Eluent solvent for the column is not mentioned. 3) “The mixture was
cooled overnight and then poured into 200 mL water and stirred overnight.” Is the mixture
needed to be cooled for overnight and again stirring in water for another overnight?]
3. Authors need to do FTIR on hPDI2CN2 for the characterization of CN groups.
4. Authors need to provide an image of 13C NMR in ESI.
5. The authors need to provide experimental details (functional and basic sets) for the DFT
calculation.
6. Table 1 and ESI: Unit of Jsc need to be corrected.
7. Reference 36 – 39: All the authors of the papers are not listed.

This investigation focus on non-fullerene acceptor hPDI-CN2 for organic solar cell. And further
investigated the influence of thermal annealing and additive for the blend morphology. What the
paper investigated is comprehensive and systematic. Through the PCE for the PDI-based device
is relatively not high enough. I suggest publication of this manuscript after minor revisions as
listed below:
1. The oxidation and reduction potential is not obvious in the CV result, therefore the UPS result
for the hPDI2-CN2 film is necessary for the paper.
2. The J-V result on Table 2 should be further discussed.
3. Through the Jsc is consistent with the EQE, it seems the gap between red line and blue is larger
than that of red and black which is comflict with the Jsc. Please explain this.
4. The SCLC results should be placed as a table.
5. The legend of rms for Fig. 3 should be “RMS” instead.

hPDI2CN2 (~28 %) and low PCE values of fabricated devices (compared to the
earlier works; JACS, 2014, 136, 15215-15221 and Nat. Comm. 2015, 6, 8242)
reduces the impact of the work a bit.
Comment:
1. In the introduction, the authors need to discuss the initial motivation of introducing
CN groups in PDI2.
Response: The discussion of this question has been added in the introduction section,
which now read as:
The introduction of subsitituents at bay-region is a favorable modification strategy to
enhance the performance of PDI-based devices. In this strategy, some
electron-withdrawing groups, such as F, CN can bring about increased electron
affinity which results in lower LUMO level and superior electronic properties.
2. ESI: Synthesis of hPDI2CN2 part is not well written. [such as 1) how much mmol
of hPDI2Br2 and CuCN were taken. 3) Eluent solvent for the column is not mentioned.
3) “The mixture was cooled overnight and then poured into 200 mL water and stirred
overnight.” Is the mixture needed to be cooled for overnight and again stirring in
water for another overnight?]
Response: These have been addressed in synthesis section (ESI) , which now read as:
Synthesis of hPDI2-CN2: The compound, hPDI2-Br2, was synthesized according to
those previously reported.1,2 1.5 g hPDI2-Br2 (0.89 mmol) and 0.9 g CuCN (10.12
mmol) was carefully mixed into a 250 mL-round bottom flask. Then the flask was
degassed by N2 gas for 30 minutes. Next, 100 mL DMF was added by syringe and
refluxed for 18 h. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and then poured into
200 mL water and stirred overnight. Further, the obtained product was extracted with
200 mL DCM and then washed with 300 mL water for three times. After removing the
residual solvent, the crude product was purified through a silica chromatography
(PE:DCM=1:2) and around 400 mg red-purple solid was obtained with a yield of
28.6 %. The alkyl chains linked with the imide nitrogen atoms are very beneficial to
increase the solubility of the molecule in common organic solvents, such as toluene,
chlorobenzene, and dichlorobenzene at room temperature.
3. Authors need to do FTIR on hPDI2CN2 for the characterization of CN groups.
Response: The FTIR spectrum of hPDI2-CN2 has been added in ESI as Fig. S2. The
peak at 2220.2 cm-1 confirm the existence of cyano group.
4. Authors need to provide an image of 13C NMR in ESI.
Response: The 13C NMR spectrum of hPDI2-CN2 has been added in ESI as Fig. S3.
5. The authors need to provide experimental details (functional and basic sets) for the
DFT calculation.
Response: All the details have been added in the characterizations section in the
revision, which read as:
DFT calculations were performed by using the Gaussian 09 software package at the
B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The alky chains were replaced by methyl groups to reduce the
computation cost. All the optimized ground-state structures were shown to be minima
by the absence of imaginary frequencies.
6. Table 1 and ESI: Unit of Jsc need to be corrected.
Response: The units of Jsc in Table 1 and ESI are corrected. We appreciate the
reviewer to point out this.
7. Reference 36 – 39: All the authors of the papers are not listed.
Response: The authors of reference 36-39 are listed in manuscript at software versions
of both WORD 2010 and WORD 2016.

Comments to the Author(s)
This investigation focus on non-fullerene acceptor hPDI-CN2 for organic solar cell.
And further investigated the influence of thermal annealing and additive for the blend
morphology. What the paper investigated is comprehensive and systematic. Through
the PCE for the PDI-based device is relatively not high enough. I suggest publication
of this manuscript after minor revisions as listed below:
1. The oxidation and reduction potential is not obvious in the CV result, therefore the
UPS result for the hPDI2-CN2 film is necessary for the paper.
Response: A new CV result with obvious reduction potential is added in ESI as Fig.
S4. The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated to be -6.11 eV and -3.98 eV, with a
modest difference to the values before (EHOMO = -6.02 eV, ELUMO = -4.08 eV).
2. The J-V result on Table 2 should be further discussed.
Response: Further discussion on Table S2 is added in the revision, which reads as:
When the active layer was annealed at 100 <U+2103>, the devices showed remarkable
increased fill factor (FF) of 51.8% compared to the value at 80 <U+2103> (FF=38.3 %) as
shown in Table S2. As the annealing temperature was increased to the 160 <U+2103>, the
devices showed further enhanced PCE of 2.45%.
3. Through the Jsc is consistent with the EQE, it seems the gap between red line and
blue is larger than that of red and black which is comflict with the Jsc. Please explain
this.
Response: When take into consideration of the deviation caused by testing
instruments, the modest discrepancy between EQE and JSC results is generally
acceptable. Further more, in the EQE result of Fig. 2, the blue line is close to red one
and larger than black line at 550 nm at which the PTB7-Th:hPDI2-CN2 blend film
shows the strongest light absorption that associate with JSC values.
4. The SCLC results should be placed as a table.
Response: The SCLC results are listed in Table S6 (ESI).
5. The legend of rms for Fig. 3 should be “RMS” instead.
Response: The legends of rms for Fig. 3, Fig. S9, Fig. S13 and Fig. S16 are corrected
as “RMS”.
