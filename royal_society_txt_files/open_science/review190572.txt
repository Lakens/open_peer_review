This is a hard one to review, mostly because the discussion has moved into a highly specialised
realm of metallic engineering where few will be able to assess the arguments with confidence. It
might be tempting to agree with the punch line that “sliding experiments using metallic balls
remain irrelevant to testing the hypothesis of Lucas et al.” – but while there are clearly technical
complications to be discussed it is by no means obvious that such experiments might not in
principle provide useful information. Moderating this statement might perhaps be considered.
Other than that, and in the assumed absence of hypothetical flaws that a specialist on metallic
materials might identify, I see no problem with publishing this response.
That said, the point of broader interest here is not the details of metallic engineering, but what
has rather misleadingly become known as “the hypothesis of Lucas et al.”. I would like to use this
opportunity to revisit the original findings reported by them and relate them to the current
disagreement. It seems to have been perceived by most readers that Lucas et al. actually
established, or at least claimed, that phytoliths do not wear dental enamel. This is a
misapprehension. In my view the key sentence in their abstract is not “We conclude that dust has
overwhelming importance as a wear agent and that dietary signals preserved in dental
microwear are indirect” but “By contrast, phytoliths and enamel chips deformed during sliding,
forming U-shaped grooves or flat troughs in enamel, without tissue loss.” This is further
elucidated in the discussion: “Contacts with these [phytolith] and other particles would, at most,
merely rearrange the enamel surface via rubbing. While such rubbing may eventually lead to
wear, many further contacts are required before cracks detach the tissue”. It is not entirely clear
what “many” means in this setting, but for a horse chewing hay at a rate of about once per second
this could potentially amount to several thousand contacts per hour, tens of thousands per day
and hundreds of millions per lifetime. In other words, Lucas et al. (2013) unequivocally and for
the first time showed that squash phytoliths did have an effect on orangutang enamel and even, if
indirectly, suggested that actual wear would result under realistic scenarios of chewing. How in a
living animal this relates to the more severe wear induced per item by quartz particles depends
on many factors, including the relative amounts of different kinds of particles actually present by
the time the food is being masticated.
It is regrettable that the careful discussion of the processes of dental wear in relation to the
properties of wear-inducing particles opened by Lucas et al. (2013) has received so little attention.
One would hope that the discussion could soon move away from infertile quibble about relative
hardness to the richer perspective of considering the interaction of different kinds of particles in
the complicated system of food being transported across and deformed between dental surfaces
of various shapes and properties. The concluding words of Lucas et al. put this well: “Much
needs to be done. On the theoretical side, variation of the critical attack angle b with indenter
geometry requires investigation. Further research is needed to extend the theory to include
conditions of mutual wear. On the practical side, the work needs to be extended to dentine.
Phytoliths would form rigid-plastic contacts with this tissue because dentinal hardness is
generally 650 MPa or less. This would influence the enamel–dentine wear ratio in teeth, where
both tissues are exposed, in a manner not previously contemplated.” While much could be
3
learned from feeding experiments with live animals there are serious limits to what can actually
be done, practical as well as ethical. I do not doubt that experimental work using properly
designed mechanical models, possibly including metallic materials, could be very helpful here.

An extremely clear and well written response. I am convinced and I have little to say. In my view,
the authors should avoid substituting proper nouns with reference numbers:

Science subject to minor revision in accordance with the referee suggestions. Please find the
referees' comments at the end of this email.
The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript.
• Ethics statement
If your study uses humans or animals please include details of the ethical approval received,

The final sentence has been moderated and now reads
“In sum, sliding experiments using metallic balls present little useful data for testing the hypothesis

That said, the point of broader interest here is not the details of metallic engineering, but what has
rather misleadingly become known as “the hypothesis of Lucas et al.”. I would like to use this

We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful and detailed opinion, and we agree that further well-
designed experimentation will progress the understanding of dental tribology. However, where
possible, we believe the incorporation of biologically derived materials rather than proxy materials
would better serve this purpose.

Comments to the Author(s)
An extremely clear and well written response. I am convinced and I have little to say. In my view, the
authors should avoid substituting proper nouns with reference numbers:
Many thanks to the reviewer
Page 3, line 39 is better as "Xia et al. [4] cite Hernot et al. [6]"
Page 3, line 46 is better as "addressed by Hernot et al. [6]"
Page 3, line 48 is better as "used by van Casteren et al. [3]"
Page 4, line 19 is better as "that used by van Casteren et al. [3]"
The above changes have been made
Appendix B
Dear Dr. Jake Socha,
We are delighted the reply has been accepted and have revised the manuscript in accord with your
editorial comments, interpolating below in blue the specific changes that we have been made.
All the best
Adam van Casteren
Please add a space between numbers and units. Aside from this minor comment, everything else
looks good; thank you for addressing the comments of the reviewers. After publication of this letter,
we will close the books on this thread, and look forward to seeing future research papers on the
topic.
Throughout the document a space has been added between numbers and units.
Lastly, could you change figure 2b so that the y axis label reads “Average pressure (GPa)” rather than
“Av.Pressure (GPa)?
Y-axis label in figure 2b has been changed. We have also corrected the Y-axis in figure 1a that was
erroneously labelled “(mm2)” it has now been corrected to “(nm2)”.
