I have read the Royal Society Open Science manuscript (RSOS-190319) ‘Body coloration and
mechanisms of colour production in Archelosauria: The case of deirocheline turtles’. I find the
paper interesting, and it contains a great deal of important information about color production in
archelosuarian reptiles.
I have several general comments:
There is so much detailed information here that the writing and presentation have to be super
tight. A few things might help tighten this story up:
Explain the coherent / incoherent scattering & broad band / narrow band reflector ideas more
clearly in the discussion.
Use direct/active sentence structure as much as possible to get the sentences meanings across,
especially in the discussion.
Describe the sexual dichromatic results in abstract, set it up briefly in intro, and describe in
results & discussion a little. This seems to be pretty concrete evidence of sexual dichromatism so
there is a story here for this topic.
I also have several specific comments:
Abstract
Line 6-7: ‘Increasing knowledge of the functional role of animal coloration stresses…’ Awkward
sentence. Rephrase.
Line 10: ; and carotenoid/pteridine derivatives contents. Choose one of the words: derivative OR
contents.
Line 12: Mention both species: ‘…we found abundant iridophores in each species, which…’
Line13: Mention both species: ‘abundant dermal collagen fibers in both species which may
serve…’
Line 14: Mention both species: ‘The colour of yellow-red skin patches in both species results
from…’
Line 17: Now describe the results of colour production mechanisms by stripe locations & tell us if
it matches predictions based on mating behavior differences between T. scripta & P. concinna.
Mention sexual dichromatic spectral results briefly after line 17 sentence.
Line 18: ‘Our results indicate that archelosaurs share some colour production mechanisms with
amphibians and lepidosaurs (mention which mechanisms), but also employ novel mechanisms
(mention which mechanisms).
Page 2: Introduction
First sentence should start off as ‘Identifying the evolutionary origins and selective pressures…as

‘’morphological traits in which developing (instead of composing) subunits evolve for various
roles…’
Line 9: clarify: ‘Colour-producing elements interact to enhance or reduce their respective
contributions to observable colour’ instead of ‘reduce each other’s contributions’
Line 24: insert new paragraph, and start with sentence ‘Iridophores contain reflecting platelets of
guanine…’
Line 38: ‘patterns are common in all major lineages (for a comprehensive….’ Delete 2nd
placement of ‘turtles’
Throughout: make sure Colour is always spelled colour throughout and NOT color.

Lines 25-29: ‘In T. scripta two of three subspecies….All Pseudemys turtles…’ These two sentences
here don’t belong in the intro but in Materials and Methods.
Rewrite line 28 ‘We particularly focus on…’ Delete that beginning and instead say something like
To determine if colour production mechanisms match our predictions based on mating behavior

Line 36: ‘We discuss our results…’ move this sentence somweher in Materials and Methods…
Line 38: ‘Our results represent the first…’ delete sentence…not important to be first here. It
might help sell your paper so you should say something like this in your introductory letter
though…
End last paragraph of introduction by stating your predictions clearly: FLBS and PM will be
brightest in T. scripta, and PM will be brightest in PC (or something to this effect).

Discussion
I am not sure about the way you start the first sentence. The claim itself is contentious because
many turtles ARE known for their color.
Line 40: ‘, studying turtle coloration and colour producing mechanisms is crucial’….
Line 43-45: long sentence, but still statement of contrasting courtship behavior should occur
earlier in the sentence.
‘…and the chemical nature of pigments that produce skin colour in two freshwater turtles with
contrasting courtship behavior, Pseudemys concinna and Trachemys scripta.
Line 51: ‘Turtles employ colour producing mechanisms found in amphibians…’
Line 53: ‘…and crocdiles [81]…’ seems to contradict what was said in previous sentence (extant
archosaurs (crocodiles and birds)…
Omit entire sentence placed in line 55-58: Carotenoids are involved in….feathers of birds, etc.
Next sentence should be ‘In addition, our pigment analyses suggest that both pteridine
derivatives and carotenoids…’
Line 62: ‘…penetrating into the body of turtles, but in some cases collagen fibre arrays may be
capable of reflecting…’
Page 11
4.1. The coloration of Deirocheline turtles
Line 12: ‘However, we did not find support for the spectral shapes reported by Wang et al [87]; in
fact…’
Is this sentence important enough to include / present in this paper? We should expect there to
be geographical / environmental variation in spectra of these stripes…the mechanistic causes to
these spectra are what’s really important.
Line 39, after info from the 2nd paragraph (‘…examined turtles (Fig 7 b,d).): write about
intraspecific differences in spectra, e.g. T. scripta scripta vs T. scripta elegans. Then write about
sexual dichromatism in spectra?
4th paragraph, Lines 55-62: better explain how reflecting platelet organization causes tissue to act
as either a narrow band or broad band reflector.
Page 12
1st paragraph, 1st sentence: rewrite 1st sentence (Unlike all yellow regions of both species,…) as a
direct-active sentence to make it more powerful.
Line 9: ‘Previous reports indicated that…you cite only 1 previous report so this statement should
be singular
4th paragraph
Line 44-Line 61, etc. this entire paragraph needs better logical flow.
Line 46: ‘The presence of red? Yellow? Xanthophores together with iridophores…’
Line 52-56: Sentence: This should make P. concinna rather conspicuous when viewed…’ This long
sentence also needs more clarity, better logical flow. Also they way this sentence is written seems
to contradict what you expect for P.c., no? Because P.c. males observe mates from above, should
there be xanthophores and iridophores be distributed dorsally (in the PM) and ventrally (in the
CBC)?

Can you better explain iridophores as coherent or incoherent scattering mechanisms in this 4.1.
section?
Section 4.2
Line 39 the collagen fibres form subepidermal collagenous lamella overlying the dermal
chroatophores…Do you mean to say this? Wouldn’t this obscure spectral reflectance?
2nd paragraph, line 55: ‘…,but color production by coherent scattering on nanostructured
5
collagen fiber arrays has been previously reported in mammals (17). The 1st & second parts of
this sentence don’t seem logically rrelated. 1st part: stating achromatic nature of the fiber, 2nd
part refers to color production by coherent scattering in mammals.
Page 14
Line 1: ‘…do not conform to the conditions of coherent scattering or predictions do not…’ These
need to be better explained then.
Section 4.3
Line 12-14: ‘Most vertebrates do produce various colors by…’ I don’t understand what you’re
trying o say here.
Much of the rest of this section seems too speculative, and perhaps needs tightening if kept in
future drafts.
4.4. Future directions. Is this heading part of RSOS format? If not, is it necessary and
appropriate? Perhaps write a conclusion section instead?
Tables
Table 1. Couldn’t table 1 be arranged / expressed to include sex differences and highlight
significant differences with an asterisk? Of course the p-values would need to be Bonferoni
correction to account for multiple comparisons.
Table 3. Spelling of word ‘length’ needs correction
Figures
Figure 2: seems to show sexual dichromatism in UV and Longwavelengths. Why not present this
statistically in results and add to abstract, intro and discussion?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors undertook a thorough examination of the pigments and structures that underlie the
integumentary pigmentation of two species of freshwater turtles, and discuss their findings in
light of the species’ different courtship behaviors and their phylogenetic relationships to other
extant groups of vertebrates. The treatment is exhaustive, except perhaps for the lack of pigment
6
quantifications, and for the most part its findings are well supported.
I struggled a bit with the first part of the introduction and its very broad brush. The authors
could probably have referenced the “interacting processes” of “functional integration of colour
ornaments and morphological modularity of colour-producing elements” without actually
naming them. To present them as “intriguing” relationships is a bit deceitful. Nothing is added
by the ”Future directions” section of the manuscript and it should probably be removed.
Throughout the manuscript, please refer to carotenoids and pteridines (or pterins) as such, not as
"derivatives". “Colour-producing” should be hyphenated throughout.
I have many other specific comments below.
Specific comments:
Page 2, line 21: five “types”, rather than “categories”.
Page 2, line 25: “mainly guanine” (hypoxanthine is also often present).
Page 2, line 57: “to this day” (not “date”).
Page 3, lines 3-5: last part of the sentence is not needed: “however sexual dichromatism is limited
to particular regions of the body.”
Page 3, line 29: “ultrastructural make-up”, not “composition”.
Page 3, line 31: “chemical nature of pigments”, not “composition”.
Page 3, line 34: “the make-up (or structure) of the skin”, not “composition”.
Page 3, last sentence: did you use a probe holder to hold the probe? If not, then how did you
achieve a fixed distance of 5 mm? If you used a probe holder, was 5 mm the distance of the probe
to the skin, or to the probe holder?
Page 4, line 59: remove “similarly to”.
Page 6, line 1: the list of carotenoid standards you acquired is not exhaustive, though probably
includes the most important ones.
Page 6, lines 26-27: reptiles (mainly lizards) are far more likely to use drosopterins to produce red
colours using pteridines than erythropterin. I am surprised that this was missed by the authors.
There are several examples of lizards with drosopterins in their integument. To mention a few
recent ones: Weiss, S.L., K. Foerster and J. Hudon. 2012. Pteridine, not carotenoid, pigments
underlie the female-specific orange ornament of striped plateau lizard (Sceloporus virgatus).

Page 6, lines 42-43: check spelling: xanthopterin, leucopterin.
Page 6, last line: the peaks are not the only features of interest. The valleys point to absorbing
compounds (pigments).
Page 7, line 51: concinna
Page 9, lines 33-34: “ … are somewhat elevated compared to the radial means …”, rather than “…
are in comparison with … relatively elevated”.
Page 10, lines 15-18: most of these pteridines are colourless, so are not likely to explain the colour
unless they contributed structurally.
Page 10, line 40: “… studying turtle coloration and colour-producing mechanisms is crucial …”
Page 10, line 56, lines 58-59: carotenoids are also present in the irises of species from many orders
of birds (Anseriformes, Galliformes, Podicipediformes, Ciconiiformes, etc…). Ref: Oehme, V.H.
(1969) Vergleichende Untersuchungen über die Färbung der Vogeliris. Biol. Zentralblatt. 88: 3-35.

Page 12, line 1: though they may not produce colour through thin-film interference, iridophores
most certainly “will” (not “may”) increase the brightness of colour regions and overall
conspicuousness to observers, thus contribute to colour. The change should be made to the
Abstract as well.

Page 12, lines 8-11: you sound like you agree with these results. You might want to change to “In
the yellow chin of C. picta only apocarotenoids were postulated …” or something of that sort.
Page 12, lines 26-27: your finding is not exactly the opposite of the previous sentence. Please state
your finding instead.
Page 13, line 5: again many of these pteridines are colourless, so probably not all that relevant.
Instead emphasize differences in the abundance of the colourful ones.
Page 13, line 50: there are no iridophores in the plumages of birds.
Page 14, line 12: “Most vertebrates produce ...” or “Most of the vertebrates produce ..”
Page 14, line 13: true of integumentary coloration, not of bird feathers. Bird feathers can harbour
many different types of pigments.
Page 14, line 25: “poses”?! Not the correct word.
Page 14, line 33: thus presumably the ancestral state (plesiomorphic).
Figure 6. It is pretty hard to discern some of the highlighted elements, like the iridophores in 6d. I
wish the smaller images were made slightly larger.
Figure 9. I am not 100% sure that the vesicles in 9c are oil droplets. They do appear to show some
internal structure. Can you see a membrane? Oil droplet should be membrane-free. Pterinosomes
don’t always show lamellae.
Figure 15. I don’t see any grey rectangle on the graphs.
Page 41, line 24: A/y0 “represents” or “captures”, not “determine”
Page 43, line 17: italicize T. scripta.
From page 43, line 56 to page 44, line 11: “pose” is not the right word. “present”, “display” or
“feature” might work.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors undertook a thorough examination of the pigments and structures that underlie the
integumentary pigmentation of two species of freshwater turtles, and discuss their findings in
light of the species’ different courtship behaviors and their phylogenetic relationships to other
13
extant groups of vertebrates. The treatment is exhaustive, except perhaps for the lack of pigment
quantifications, and for the most part its findings are well supported.
I struggled a bit with the first part of the introduction and its very broad brush. The authors
could probably have referenced the “interacting processes” of “functional integration of colour
ornaments and morphological modularity of colour-producing elements” without actually
naming them. To present them as “intriguing” relationships is a bit deceitful. Nothing is added
by the ”Future directions” section of the manuscript and it should probably be removed.
Throughout the manuscript, please refer to carotenoids and pteridines (or pterins) as such, not as
"derivatives". “Colour-producing” should be hyphenated throughout.
I have many other specific comments below.
Specific comments:
Page 2, line 21: five “types”, rather than “categories”.
Page 2, line 25: “mainly guanine” (hypoxanthine is also often present).
Page 2, line 57: “to this day” (not “date”).
Page 3, lines 3-5: last part of the sentence is not needed: “however sexual dichromatism is limited
to particular regions of the body.”
Page 3, line 29: “ultrastructural make-up”, not “composition”.
Page 3, line 31: “chemical nature of pigments”, not “composition”.
Page 3, line 34: “the make-up (or structure) of the skin”, not “composition”.
Page 3, last sentence: did you use a probe holder to hold the probe? If not, then how did you
achieve a fixed distance of 5 mm? If you used a probe holder, was 5 mm the distance of the probe
to the skin, or to the probe holder?
Page 4, line 59: remove “similarly to”.
Page 6, line 1: the list of carotenoid standards you acquired is not exhaustive, though probably
includes the most important ones.
Page 6, lines 26-27: reptiles (mainly lizards) are far more likely to use drosopterins to produce red
colours using pteridines than erythropterin. I am surprised that this was missed by the authors.
There are several examples of lizards with drosopterins in their integument. To mention a few
recent ones: Weiss, S.L., K. Foerster and J. Hudon. 2012. Pteridine, not carotenoid, pigments
underlie the female-specific orange ornament of striped plateau lizard (Sceloporus virgatus).

Page 6, lines 42-43: check spelling: xanthopterin, leucopterin.
Page 6, last line: the peaks are not the only features of interest. The valleys point to absorbing
compounds (pigments).
Page 7, line 51: concinna
Page 9, lines 33-34: “ … are somewhat elevated compared to the radial means …”, rather than “…
are in comparison with … relatively elevated”.
Page 10, lines 15-18: most of these pteridines are colourless, so are not likely to explain the colour
unless they contributed structurally.
Page 10, line 40: “… studying turtle coloration and colour-producing mechanisms is crucial …”
Page 10, line 56, lines 58-59: carotenoids are also present in the irises of species from many orders
of birds (Anseriformes, Galliformes, Podicipediformes, Ciconiiformes, etc…). Ref: Oehme, V.H.

Page 12, line 1: though they may not produce colour through thin-film interference, iridophores
most certainly “will” (not “may”) increase the brightness of colour regions and overall
14
conspicuousness to observers, thus contribute to colour. The change should be made to the
Abstract as well.
Page 12, lines 8-11: you sound like you agree with these results. You might want to change to “In
the yellow chin of C. picta only apocarotenoids were postulated …” or something of that sort.
Page 12, lines 26-27: your finding is not exactly the opposite of the previous sentence. Please state
your finding instead.
Page 13, line 5: again many of these pteridines are colourless, so probably not all that relevant.
Instead emphasize differences in the abundance of the colourful ones.
Page 13, line 50: there are no iridophores in the plumages of birds.
Page 14, line 12: “Most vertebrates produce ...” or “Most of the vertebrates produce ..”
Page 14, line 13: true of integumentary coloration, not of bird feathers. Bird feathers can harbour
many different types of pigments.
Page 14, line 25: “poses”?! Not the correct word.
Page 14, line 33: thus presumably the ancestral state (plesiomorphic).
Figure 6. It is pretty hard to discern some of the highlighted elements, like the iridophores in 6d. I
wish the smaller images were made slightly larger.
Figure 9. I am not 100% sure that the vesicles in 9c are oil droplets. They do appear to show some
internal structure. Can you see a membrane? Oil droplet should be membrane-free. Pterinosomes
don’t always show lamellae.
Figure 15. I don’t see any grey rectangle on the graphs.
Page 41, line 24: A/y0 “represents” or “captures”, not “determine”
Page 43, line 17: italicize T. scripta.
From page 43, line 56 to page 44, line 11: “pose” is not the right word. “present”, “display” or
“feature” might work.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
I have read the Royal Society Open Science manuscript (RSOS-190319 rev 1) ‘Body coloration and
mechanisms of colour production in Archelosauria: The case of deirocheline turtles’. The authors
attended to the previous comments of reviewers and the findings and implications of this
interesting work are more understandable. I believe it is almost ready for publication, but I have a
few specific suggestions:
Make sure various words are consistently spelled with UK-style spelling rules throughout paper.
E.g. Colour (not color), behavior (not behavior), etc. The title still has the ‘US’ spelling for color.
Abstract
Line 6: should write as ‘colour production still remain unknown.’
Line 9: rewrite these few sentences to describe the perspective more logically: We found
xanthophores, melanophres, abundant iridophores and dermal collagen fibers is stripes of both
species. Moreover, in both species, the xanthophores coloring the yellow-red skin contain
carotenoids, pterins, and riboflavin, but the two species differ in the distribution of pigment cell
types and pigment diversity. Both Pseudemys concinna’s and T. scripta’s yellow chin and
forelimb stripes contain xanthophores and iridophores, but P. concinna and T. scripta’s post-
orbital region’s differ in cell-type distribution. T. scripta’s post-orbital stripes contain
xanthophores and iridiophores, while T. scripta’s yellow-red post-orbital / zygomatic regions
contain xanthophores only.
Introduction
Line 38: We predict that regions of the skin that males expose to females during courtship should
richer in pigment contents than regions not exposed during courtship. Omit the word ‘bright’
from these predictions because in tri-stimulus theory brightness means the amount of total
reflectance coming off the integument and correlates inversely with increased pigment
concentrations.
Materials and Methods
2.2 Spectral reflectance measurements
Line 51: necessary to include & describe the Cumberland slider? Seems to suggest you’re going to
present research on it, and of course you aren’t.
Page 4, line 1: Make sure your abbreviations are formatted consistently throughout. E.g. if using
bold-face for them makre sure they are all bold face (in later sections, etc). I don’t think you need
to use bold-face on these abbreviations.
Results
Page 10, Line 29: 1st sentence of 2nd full paragraph: Normalized averaged radial means of the
Fourier power spectra…’ This is a long, run-on sentence and should be broken into 2-3 sentences.
Why is the zygomatic region of P. concinnna abbreviated as YP? Wouldn’t it be more intuitive if
it were abbreviated ‘ZP’ (for zygomatic patch)? No other abbreviation has Y in it to mention
color, and in general the letters represent anatomical locations instead of color.
Discussion
Page 13 line 6: Is ‘wavelets’ the correct word?
Line 10: ‘As the reflecting platelets of iridophores from the CBC of T. scripta are highly ____, they
produce…’ Are you missing an adjective here?
Line 28: ‘All yellow regions of both species contain hydroxylated xanthophylls such as lutein and
16
zeaxanthin…’
Page 15, line 2: Sentence meaning is unclear. Do you mean ‘As mating strategies are better
understood?’ or ‘become better studied’? Or should the sentence read ‘Because mating strategies
are well-studied in this group, it may be relatively straightforward to test hypotheses about
sexual selection’?
4.3 Significance for vertebrate skin colour evolution
Line 65: ‘Physiological mechanisms of colour production…’
Line 69: ‘Iridophore and xanthophore differentiation has been lost…’
Page 16, 1st full paragraph:
Line 9: How about ‘Xanthophores are pigment cells that contain carotenoids and pterins in their
vesicles.’?
Line 11: ‘Except a rare occurrence in feathers of penguins…’
Tables and Figures
Figure 3. Minor detail, but should the B1-and H1-based spectral variables (i.e. brightness and
hue) be written with the same format as the S1 variables? E.g., since S1.blueCBC, shouldn’t
B1.CBC? H1.CBC?
Figure 10: overlay abbreviations for names of colored regions above the regions on these images
(e.g. CBC, DHC, PM, & YP)?
Figure 12: x-axes (wavelength) spelled wrong.
Fig 10 caption: why is zygomatic patch abbreviated YP?
Fig 12. 1st sentence of caption should read: ‘Distribution of predicted reflectivity of reflecting
platelets of iridophores based on Fourier Analysis. (a)…’

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
I previously reviewed this paper. I commend the authors for resampling the skins for evidence of
riboflavin and drosopterin, a pteridine often found in lepidosaurians with red tones. I think that
it adds perspective to the paper.
17
I must qualify a comment I made in my past review. I pointed out that many of the pteridines the
authors found in the brightly-coloured surfaces of turtles were colourless and might not
contribute directly to skin colours we (humans) perceive as yellow or red. This led the authors to
revise their manuscript to try to explain the presence of colourless pteridines, which produced a
treatment that was not evenly convincing (see specific comment below). I will add another
consideration to the mix: since many of these “colourless” pteridines absorb in the UV and turtles
can see in the UV (as pointed out in the manuscript: p. 34, line 10), it is probably reasonable to
assume that they would produce/alter colours that turtles can see (unlike us).
My main concern this time around is with the way the authors characterize birds in the last
section of the manuscript (“Significance for vertebrate skin colour evolution”). It is inaccurate to
state that birds lack pigment cells other than melanocytes. Birds may have largely lost pigments
cells from their integument as a result of the development of an outer covering of feathers, but
they retained most pigment cell types (e.g., xanthophores and iridophores) in their irises
(Oliphant et al. 1992 Pigment Cell Res 5:367-371). I note that turtles probably have similar
pigments cells in their irises than they do in their integuments, since the color patterns on the face
of turtles often continue uninterrupted across the iris. I think that making a distinction between
the pigment cells of the integument and those of the iris is inappropriate, since BOTH derive
equally from neural crest cells (see review on the origin of cells that form the eye in Williams and
Bohnsack 2015 Birth Defects Research 105:87-95). The pigment cells in the irises of birds may no
longer have dendritic projections and motile pigment organelles (and thus might be more
appropriately called xanthocytes and iridocytes), but that is beside the point.
Specific comments:
Page 23, line 39: I suggest “pigment types” rather than “pigment contents”, as the latter implies
quantification (which did not take place).
Page 23, line 42-44: Awkward sentence. Maybe something like: “The chin, forelimb, and
postorbital yellow stripes of Pseudemys concinna contains xanthophores …”
Page 24, lines 8 and 9: “colour-producing elements” is sometimes hyphenated, but not always (as
here). Please make sure that “colour-producing” is hyphenated throughout.
Page 24, line 55: Remove extra “in”: “playing a role in in colour production”.
Page 25, lines 30, 33: I suggest rich in “pigment types”? or “pigments”?
Page 28, line 41: you are missing micron in: 2.6 µm
Page 28, line 42 “tert-butyl methyl ether”
Page 29, lines 7-10: Awkward sentence. I suggest something like “Separation of all studied
compounds with the exception of drosopterin was achieved through isocratic elution at a flow
rate of 0.5 ml/min with a mobile phase of …”
Page 32 last line: Again “pigment types” would be preferable to “pigment contents”.
Page 33, lines 16 and 18: This is confusing. Some pigments were not detected in any samples. But
then T. s. scripta contained all types except pterin. I suspect that the latter sample did not contain
the pigments not detected in any sample, but this should be made clearer. Please revise the text.
Page 33, lines 22-29: This is largely a repeat of results from the previous two paragraphs, but
framed differently. It is hard for me to justify repeating information when the paper is already so
long.
Page 33, line 57: You are playing with words here. Pterins and carotenoids actually are involved
in the production of yellow-red colours in birds, maybe not in their integument, but in the iris.
Page 35, line 28: “both species contain the hydroxylated xanthophylls …”.
Page 35, line 35: “whereas the orange neck and leg contained apocarotenoids and
ketocarotenoids.”
Page 35, last paragraph: Since turtles can see in the ultraviolet what look like colourless pterins to
us may actually be visible (and coloured) to turtles.
Page 36 lines 1-2: I find this suggestion highly speculative and a bit far-fetched.
18
Page 37, last line. It is untrue that birds do not develop iridophores and xanthophores. They do in
the iris.
Page 38, line 13. A period is missing after “[160, 162,163]”.
Page 38, line 14: “contain pigments similar to those in xanthophores”.
Page 38, lines 17-18: carotenoids and pterins do act together to produce colour in the iris of some
birds (as pointed out earlier in the paper).
Page 38, line 20: Birds should to be listed here as well, as there are examples of pterins
contributing with carotenoids to yellow-red colours, again in the iris.
Page 38, line 22: This is incorrect. Some birds possess xanthophores in their irises (unless you
want to be technical and call those xanthocytes).
Figure 9. I am still not 100% sure that the vesicles in 9e (not 9c in my previous review, my
mistake) are oil droplets. They do appear to show some internal structure.

Page 15, line 2: Sentence meaning is unclear. Do you mean ‘As mating strategies are better

Comments to the Author(s)
I previously reviewed this paper. I commend the authors for resampling the skins for evidence of
riboflavin and drosopterin, a pteridine often found in lepidosaurians with red tones. I think that
it adds perspective to the paper.
I must qualify a comment I made in my past review. I pointed out that many of the pteridines the
authors found in the brightly-coloured surfaces of turtles were colourless and might not
contribute directly to skin colours we (humans) perceive as yellow or red. This led the authors to
revise their manuscript to try to explain the presence of colourless pteridines, which produced a
treatment that was not evenly convincing (see specific comment below). I will add another
consideration to the mix: since many of these “colourless” pteridines absorb in the UV and turtles
can see in the UV (as pointed out in the manuscript: p. 34, line 10), it is probably reasonable to
assume that they would produce/alter colours that turtles can see (unlike us).
My main concern this time around is with the way the authors characterize birds in the last
section of the manuscript (“Significance for vertebrate skin colour evolution”). It is inaccurate to
state that birds lack pigment cells other than melanocytes. Birds may have largely lost pigments
cells from their integument as a result of the development of an outer covering of feathers, but
they retained most pigment cell types (e.g., xanthophores and iridophores) in their irises
(Oliphant et al. 1992 Pigment Cell Res 5:367-371). I note that turtles probably have similar
pigments cells in their irises than they do in their integuments, since the color patterns on the face
of turtles often continue uninterrupted across the iris. I think that making a distinction between
the pigment cells of the integument and those of the iris is inappropriate, since BOTH derive
equally from neural crest cells (see review on the origin of cells that form the eye in Williams and
Bohnsack 2015 Birth Defects Research 105:87-95). The pigment cells in the irises of birds may no
longer have dendritic projections and motile pigment organelles (and thus might be more
appropriately called xanthocytes and iridocytes), but that is beside the point.
Specific comments:
Page 23, line 39: I suggest “pigment types” rather than “pigment contents”, as the latter implies
quantification (which did not take place).
23
Page 23, line 42-44: Awkward sentence. Maybe something like: “The chin, forelimb, and
postorbital yellow stripes of Pseudemys concinna contains xanthophores …”
Page 24, lines 8 and 9: “colour-producing elements” is sometimes hyphenated, but not always (as
here). Please make sure that “colour-producing” is hyphenated throughout.
Page 24, line 55: Remove extra “in”: “playing a role in in colour production”.
Page 25, lines 30, 33: I suggest rich in “pigment types”? or “pigments”?
Page 28, line 41: you are missing micron in: 2.6 µm
Page 28, line 42 “tert-butyl methyl ether”
Page 29, lines 7-10: Awkward sentence. I suggest something like “Separation of all studied
compounds with the exception of drosopterin was achieved through isocratic elution at a flow
rate of 0.5 ml/min with a mobile phase of …”
Page 32 last line: Again “pigment types” would be preferable to “pigment contents”.
Page 33, lines 16 and 18: This is confusing. Some pigments were not detected in any samples. But
then T. s. scripta contained all types except pterin. I suspect that the latter sample did not contain
the pigments not detected in any sample, but this should be made clearer. Please revise the text.
Page 33, lines 22-29: This is largely a repeat of results from the previous two paragraphs, but
framed differently. It is hard for me to justify repeating information when the paper is already so
long.
Page 33, line 57: You are playing with words here. Pterins and carotenoids actually are involved
in the production of yellow-red colours in birds, maybe not in their integument, but in the iris.
Page 35, line 28: “both species contain the hydroxylated xanthophylls …”.
Page 35, line 35: “whereas the orange neck and leg contained apocarotenoids and
ketocarotenoids.”
Page 35, last paragraph: Since turtles can see in the ultraviolet what look like colourless pterins to
us may actually be visible (and coloured) to turtles.
Page 36 lines 1-2: I find this suggestion highly speculative and a bit far-fetched.
Page 37, last line. It is untrue that birds do not develop iridophores and xanthophores. They do in
the iris.
Page 38, line 13. A period is missing after “[160, 162,163]”.
Page 38, line 14: “contain pigments similar to those in xanthophores”.
Page 38, lines 17-18: carotenoids and pterins do act together to produce colour in the iris of some
birds (as pointed out earlier in the paper).
Page 38, line 20: Birds should to be listed here as well, as there are examples of pterins
contributing with carotenoids to yellow-red colours, again in the iris.
Page 38, line 22: This is incorrect. Some birds possess xanthophores in their irises (unless you
want to be technical and call those xanthocytes).
Figure 9. I am still not 100% sure that the vesicles in 9e (not 9c in my previous review, my
mistake) are oil droplets. They do appear to show some internal structure.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Kristina Sefc):
The manuscript has been seen by two reviewers, who are impressed by the wealth of novel infor-
mation which is provided by this study. Both of them also notice the difficulty of packaging so much
information into a digestible format, and offer numerous suggestions to improve the presentation of
the data. I’d like to ask the authors to follow their advice and am looking forward to a revision of the
manuscript.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
I have read the Royal Society Open Science manuscript (RSOS-190319) ‘Body coloration and mecha-
nisms of colour production in Archelosauria: The case of deirocheline turtles. I find the paper inter-
esting, and it contains a great deal of important information about colour production in
archelosuarian reptiles. I have several general comments:
There is so much detailed information here that the writing and presentation have to be super tight.
A few things might help tighten this story up:
We are impressed by the great effort devoted by Reviewer 1 to our manuscript. Thank you
very much for all the comments and suggestions.
Explain the coherent / incoherent scattering & broad band / narrow band reflector ideas more clear-
ly in the discussion.
We explain the coherent/incoherent scattering and broadband/narrowband reflectors in the
5th paragraph on reflecting platelets of iridophores in section 4.1 now.
Use direct/active sentence structure as much as possible to get the sentences meanings across, es-
pecially in the discussion.
Revised
Describe the sexual dichromatic results in abstract, set it up briefly in intro, and describe in results &
discussion a little. This seems to be pretty concrete evidence of sexual dichromatism so there is a
story here for this topic.

Abstract
Line 6-7: ‘Increasing knowledge of the functional role of animal coloration stresses…’ Awkward sen-

Line 17: Now describe the results of colour production mechanisms by stripe locations & tell us if it
matches predictions based on mating behaviour differences between T. scripta & P. concinna.
Mention sexual dichromatic spectral results briefly after line 17 sentence.
We have added “Pseudemys concinna has chin, forelimb, and postorbital yellow stripes con-
taining xanthophores and iridophores, whereas T. scripta has xanthophores and iridophores
in chin and forelimb yellow stripes but only xanthophores in yellow-red postor-
bital/zygomatic regions. T. s. elegans is sexually dichromatic. The distribution of pigment cell
types across body regions may be related to visual signalling but does not match predictions
based on courtship position differences between the two species.”

We have removed the sentence.
End last paragraph of introduction by stating your predictions clearly: FLBS and PM will be brightest
in T. scripta, and PM will be brightest in PC (or something to this effect).
We have added following: “We predict that regions of the skin that males expose during
courtship to females should be brighter in colour and richer in pigment contents than regions
not exposed during courtship. Specifically, in P. concinna we expect the yellow chin to be
sexually dichromatic, bright, and rich in pigment contents compared to other skin surfaces.
In T. scripta we expect all regions exposed during courtship, i. e. dorsal and ventral head and
limbs, to be sexually dichromatic, bright, and rich in pigment contents. “

Discussion
I am not sure about the way you start the first sentence. The claim itself is contentious because
many turtles ARE known for their color.
We have changed the first sentence “Although they are not known for their vivid, conspicu-
ous body coloration, many turtles are in fact as colourful as other vertebrates.” to “Although
animal coloration research has traditionally focused on other groups, many turtles have
bright, conspicuous colours [75]. “
Line 40: ‘, studying turtle coloration and colour producing mechanisms is crucial’….

Line 43-45: long sentence, but still statement of contrasting courtship behavior should occur earlier
in the sentence.

We have replaced “In this study we analysed the pigment cell organization of the integu-

We would like to keep the sentence if possible. The reported peaks at 372 nm are artifacts
and we think this should be stated here. See Figure 1 in Wang et al. 2013. In the results the
peak at 372 nm is reported to be female specific “<U+5728> 300~400 nm <U+7684><U+7D2B> <U+5916><U+7EBF><U+533A><U+6BB5>,<U+96CC><U+6027><U+4E2A>

females have peak at ~372 nm in every measured site (see arrow).” The study is relevant to
the topic of this paper which has been often cited.
Line 39, after info from the 2nd paragraph (‘…examined turtles (Fig 7 b,d).): write about intraspecific
differences in spectra, e.g. T. scripta scripta vs T. scripta elegans. Then write about sexual dichroma-
tism in spectra?
We have added new paragraph on sexual dichromatism
“We found intersexual differences in the reflectance spectra of CBC and FLBS of T. s.
elegans but not P. concinna (Table 1). These results contrast with a previous study reporting
no intersexual differences in coloration in T. s. elegans [84]. The small sample sizes may be
responsible for our inability to statistically support the effect of sex on colour in P. concinna.
Sexual dichromatism is apparently present in some deirocheline turtles. For example, males
of the northern map turtle (Graptemys geographica) have brighter postorbital patches than
females [36]. However, in other species, such as Chrysemys picta [37]and Malaclemmys
terrapin [35], there is little or no sexual dichromatism. Sexual dichromatism has been hy-
pothesized to result from females becoming duller as they grow and age [37]. Growth is
known to affect the reflectance spectra of colourful regions in some turtles [100]. Moreover,
males of some species of deirocheline turtles undergo ontogenetic colour change as they get
larger and older [49,101]. As we have excluded melanistic males from the spectral meas-
urements, the sexual dichromatism of T. s. elegans found here is not due to ontogenetic col-
our change of males. Nevertheless, it will be interesting in the future to examine the
postnatal ontogenesis of colour-producing mechanisms in deirocheline turtles to see how
sexual dichromatism arises as the turtles grow and age. “
4th paragraph, Lines 55-62: better explain how reflecting platelet organization causes tissue to act
as either a narrow band or broad band reflector.
We have revised the paragraph which now reads as follows
“Continuous layers of iridophores with organized reflecting platelets are found in T.
scripta but not in P. concinna. The colour produced by the scattering of incident light on ar-
rays of particles depends on the organization, size, and the refractive index of particles
[108]. Incoherent scattering occurs when the distances between individual particles are ran-
dom (e. g. reflecting platelets are randomly arranged in iridophores) causing the phases of
wavelets of light to nearly cancel out. In contrast, coherent scattering occurs when the dis-

10
tances between individual particles are similar (e. g. when reflecting platelets are organized
in iridophores) causing the phases of wavelets of light either to completely cancel out or add
up to produce relatively high reflectance. As the reflecting platelets of iridophores from the
CBC of T. scripta are highly they produce colour by coherent scattering. Highly organized
reflecting platelets in orange and yellow skin regions of the lizards Uta stansburiana [60],
Sceloporus undulatus, and S. magister [59] reflect orange and yellow wavelengths due to
thin-film interference, which is a special case of coherent scattering. The thin-film interfer-
ence model predicts the highest reflectivity of the CBC of T. scripta to be between 618 and
637 nm (Fig. 12 a, b). Other regions of turtle skin containing iridophores, i. e. yellow FLBS of
T. scripta and all yellow regions of P. concinna, do not have organized reflecting platelets.
Iridophores with randomly organized platelets in red and white skin of Phelsuma grandis
produce broadband reflection which enhance the overall brightness of the corresponding
skin patch [16]. The disorganized prismatic guanin crystals of some spiders produce matte-
white colour by incoherent (diffuse) light scattering [109]. However, prismatic crystals of
spiders are around one micrometre in size [110], while disorganized reflecting platelets of
fish [109], lizards [16] and turtles (Table 3) are much smaller. The yellow regions containing
iridophores in T. scripta have increased brightness relative to yellow regions without irido-
phores (Figure 2). Thus even if they do not produce colour through thin-film interference, the
iridophores most likely increase the brightness of colour patches and their overall conspicu-
ousness to observers, thus contributing to colour [4,111]. Whether or not the scattering on
disorganized reflecting platelets in turtles is coherent or incoherent remains to be an-
swered.”

1st paragraph, 1st sentence: rewrite 1st sentence (Unlike all yellow regions of both species,) as a

We have replaced “Unlike all yellow regions of both species, which contain xanthophylls lu-
tein and zeaxanthin, the red PM of T. s. elegans contains the ketocarotenoids astaxanthin
and canthaxanthin (Table 4, Fig. S1).” by “All yellow regions of both species contain hydrox-

We have revised the section 4.2
Line 46: ‘The presence of red? Yellow? Xanthophores together with iridophores…’
Revised as “The presence of red-yellow xanthophores together…” Because the xanthophores
in T.s.e are red whereas in T.s.s. are yellow.
Line 52-56: Sentence: This should make P. concinna rather conspicuous when viewed…’ This long
sentence also needs more clarity, better logical flow. Also they way this sentence is written seems to
contradict what you expect for P.c., no? Because P.c. males observe mates from above, should there
be xanthophores and iridophores be distributed dorsally (in the PM) and ventrally (in the CBC)?
It is true. We have revised the section 4.2. Please see the manuscript for the changes we
have made.

Section 4.2
Line 39 the collagen fibres form subepidermal collagenous lamella overlying the dermal
chroatophores…Do you mean to say this? Wouldn’t this obscure spectral reflectance?
Yes, we really mean to say this. Specific organization of collagen fibres may result in trans-
parent clear tissue as in cornea (Benedek 1971 Theory of transparency of the eye. Applied
optics, 10(3), 459-473). Thus, in fish and tadpoles, the subepidermal collagenous lamella
must maintain specific order of collagen fibres in order to not obscure spectral reflectance.
Indeed, there are examples of completely transparent fish and tadpoles. We have clarified
by “In many fish and amphibian larvae, the collagen fibres form transparent subepidermal
collagenous lamella overlying the dermal chromatophores [20,127,128] .“
2nd paragraph, line 55: ‘…,but color production by coherent scattering on nanostructured collagen

Reviewer: 2
The authors undertook a thorough examination of the pigments and structures that underlie the
integumentary pigmentation of two species of freshwater turtles, and discuss their findings in light
of the species’ different courtship behaviors and their phylogenetic relationships to other extant
groups of vertebrates. The treatment is exhaustive, except perhaps for the lack of pigment quantifi-
cations, and for the most part its findings are well supported.
We are very thankful for all the comments and for the extraordinary effort Reviewer 2 has
made.
It is true that we do not report any quantitative results for pigment analyses. The
main reason is the small sample size of individuals analyzed to provide representative quan-
titative results. We find that the main differences observed between Trachemys scripta and
Pseudemys concinna are qualitative rather than quantitative. This is in contrast with our
previous experience with analyzing lizard coloration where quantification was essential and
necessary to interpret the results (Andrade et al. 2019 Regulatory changes in pterin and ca-
rotenoid genes underlie balanced color polymorphisms in the wall lizard. PNAS, 116(12),
5633-5642.)
I struggled a bit with the first part of the introduction and its very broad brush. The authors could
probably have referenced the “interacting processes” of “functional integration of colour ornaments
and morphological modularity of colour-producing elements” without actually naming them.
We have revised the first paragraph which now reads as follows
“Identifying the evolutionary origins and the selective processes responsible for the
maintenance of complex morphological traits remains a persistent challenge in biology. An-
imal coloration is a complex morphological trait resulting from the interaction of multiple
elements that evolve for various roles and only later are co-opted to produce colour [1,2].
Variation in body coloration during evolution is the result of two processes [3]: integration
of colour producing elements to produce the observable colour [4], and independent devel-
opment and evolution of colour producing elements [5]. The intricate relationships between
colour-producing elements and their functional role stress the need to study the proximate
causes of colour production [6]. While there has been progress in our understanding of the
functions of animal coloration [7,8], our knowledge of colour production mechanisms in
most groups of animals is still scarce. ”
To present them as “intriguing” relationships is a bit deceitful.

We have replaced “intriguing” by “intricate”.
Nothing is added by the “Future directions” section of the manuscript and it should probably be
removed.
The section was removed.
Throughout the manuscript, please refer to carotenoids and pteridines (or pterins) as such, not as
"derivatives".
Initially we thought the term “pteridine derivative” would be the best to avoid confusion
with Pterin as specific compound. To refer to the compounds we have analyzed as “pteri-
dines” may lead to confusion as flavins also contain a pteridine ring. We now refer to “pteri-
dine derivatives” with keto and amino groups as “pterins”.
“Colour-producing” should be hyphenated throughout.

We achieved constant distance between the probe and turtle skin by means of an entomo-
logical pin attached head down to the probe. We have clarified this now in the manuscript:
“Reflectance spectra were taken in a darkened room using a hand-held probe oriented per-
pendicular to the skin surface (i.e. coincident normal measuring geometry [48]). An entomo-
logical pin (with acrylic head down) attached to the side of the probe allowed us to maintain
a fixed 5 mm distance between the probe and the skin surface “
Page 4, line 59: remove “similarly to”.
Revised as suggested.
Page 6, line 1: the list of carotenoid standards you acquired is not exhaustive, though probably in-
cludes the most important ones.
It is true that the list of standards represents only a narrow subset of carotenoids. However,
1) the standards characterize the most abundant carotenoids present in the samples; 2) the
results of analyses show additional peaks on chromatogram presented as Figure S1 in sup-
plement. Detailed analytical study would be required to disentangle every specific carote-
noid and carotenoid derivative in the samples. We would be very happy if we could acquire
as many standards as possible and analyse the turtle pigments in more detail in further
study.
Page 6, lines 26-27: reptiles (mainly lizards) are far more likely to use drosopterins to produce red
colours using pteridines than erythropterin. I am surprised that this was missed by the authors.
There are several examples of lizards with drosopterins in their integument. To mention a few re-

Thank you for this comment and all the references you provide.
The sentence “Carotenoids are involved in colour production in the feathers….” was removed
as suggested by Reviewer 1. We have also revised following sentence “However, our pig-
ment analyses suggest that both pteridine derivatives and carotenoids are involved in the
production of the yellow-red skin colours of turtles, which had not been clearly documented
in any archelosaur to this date.“ Which now reads as „In addition, our pigment analyses
suggest that both pterins and carotenoids are involved in the production of the yellow-red
skin colours of turtles, which had not been clearly documented in integument of any
archelosaur to this date“.
We cite the suggested references in revised section 4.3
Page 12, line 1: though they may not produce colour through thin-film interference, iridophores
most certainly “will” (not “may”) increase the brightness of colour regions and overall conspicuous-
ness to observers, thus contribute to colour. The change should be made to the Abstract as well.
Revised as suggested.
Page 12, lines 8-11: you sound like you agree with these results. You might want to change to “In the
yellow chin of C. picta only apocarotenoids were postulated …” or something of that sort.
Revised as suggested. Now the sentence reads as follows “In the yellow chin of C. picta only
apocarotenoids were described, whereas the orange neck and leg contain apocarotenoids
and ketocarotenoids. A previous report indicated that apocarotenoids are abundant in tissue
from yellow chin and yellow neck stripes of T. scripta, its “orange” postorbital region con-
taining only ketocarotenoids [30]. “

We have replaced “Our results show the opposite is true (Table 4).” By “Our results show
that both yellow and red regions of turtle skin contain multiple types of pterins (Table 4).”
Page 13, line 5: again many of these pteridines are colourless, so probably not all that relevant. In-
stead emphasize differences in the abundance of the colourful ones.
We have revised and amended the paragraph describing differences in pterin content in sec-
tion 4.1. Please see the revised manuscript.
Page 13, line 50: there are no iridophores in the plumages of birds.
The sentence was not clear. We have clarified by following: “ A thermoprotective function of
colour-producing structures has been suggested for iridophores found in frogs [141] or cha-
meleons [58]. A thermoprotective function has also been suggested for the keratinous feath-
ers of birds that reflect infrared wavelengths due to their microstructure[142,143]. “
Page 14, line 12: “Most vertebrates produce ...” or “Most of the vertebrates produce ..”
We have revised section 4.3
Page 14, line 13: true of integumentary coloration, not of bird feathers. Bird feathers can harbour
many different types of pigments.
We meant that there are no pigment cell types other than melanocytes in birds. The other
pigments in feathers are not of pigment cell origin, but rather result from physiological ac-
tions of keratinocytes (Vanhoutteghemet al. (2004) Serial cultivation of chicken keratino-
cytes, a composite cell type that accumulates lipids and synthesizes a novel ß-
keratin. Differentiation, 72(4), 123-137; McGraw (2004) Colorful songbirds metabolize ca-
rotenoids at the integument. Journal of Avian Biology, 35(6), 471-476). We have revised sec-
tion 4.3
Page 14, line 25: “poses”?! Not the correct word.
“poses” replaced by “contain”.
Page 14, line 33: thus presumably the ancestral state (plesiomorphic).
We have added new sentence: “…has been reported in fish [113], amphibians [148], and
lizards [105,149]. Thus colour-production by interplay between carotenoids and pterins pre-
sumably represents the ancestral state in vertebrates. “

Figure 6. It is pretty hard to discern some of the highlighted elements, like the iridophores in 6d. I
wish the smaller images were made slightly larger.
The 6d is to show context of all elements in the dark stripe. Iridophores there are very small,
and the highlighting is supposed to illustrate their presence, even at this magnification are
hard to discern. We have included electromicrograph of higher magnification of iridophore
next to the dermal melanosme in the dark stripe 6g. The figure 6g has arrows instead of
white line to not obscure area of basal lamina and arrowhead instead of turquoise line to
not obscure details of iridophore.
Figure 9. I am not 100% sure that the vesicles in 9c are oil droplets. They do appear to show some
internal structure. Can you see a membrane? Oil droplet should be membrane-free. Pterinosomes
don’t always show lamellae.
There are no oil droplets in Figure 9. All of the structures in Figure 9. have a visible mem-
brane. Vesicles in Figure 9 c have prominent concentric lamellae that are characteristic of
pterinosomes. Vesicles in Figure 9 a, b are similar to the carotenoid vesicles in other studies.
It is true however, that vesicles of similar ultrastructure as 9 b have been reported previously
reported as immature vesicles (possibly pterinosomes). We do point to this fact in section
4.1. The resemblance of the vesicles in Figure 9 a, b in electron density to carotenoid con-
taining oil droplets as well as the results of the pigment analyses in these same regions sug-
gests that these structures are carotenoid vesicles with different pigment contents.

There is no grey rectangle in Figure 15. We apologize for the mistake. The sentence has been

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Kristina Sefc):
Dear authors,
Both reviewers agree with the changes that were made to the manuscript and offer specific sugges-
tions to improve the wording and clarity. Reviewer 2 also requests a revision in regard to the intrep-
retation of colorless pteridines and a correction of the Information on avian pigment cells. Please
follow their suggestions closely. Additionally, please complete the figure caption for Figure S1 (G –
J). Do you have any citable source for drosopterin extraction with DMSO?
Sincerely, Kristina Sefc
Drosopterin was not extracted with DMSO. Drosopterin was extracted from frozen fruit flies with
acidic methanol following the procedure described in Ferré et al. [70] . The extract was later diluted
with DMSO and used as a working solution. As far as turtle skin extracts, these were extracted with
DMSO as we did in the analyses of skin of lizard [72], where we have detected drosopterin.

Reviewer: 1
I have read the Royal Society Open Science manuscript (RSOS-190319 rev 1) ‘Body coloration and
mechanisms of colour production in Archelosauria: The case of deirocheline turtles’. The authors
attended to the previous comments of reviewers and the findings and implications of this interest-
ing work are more understandable. I believe it is almost ready for publication, but I have a few spe-
cific suggestions:
Make sure various words are consistently spelled with UK-style spelling rules throughout paper. E.g.
Colour (not color), behavior (not behavior), etc. The title still has the ‘US’ spelling for color.
We checked carefully the spelling of “colour” throughout the manuscript and have not found any
misspelling. We spell “coloration” following McFarland, D. (2014). A dictionary of animal behaviour.

Line 9: rewrite these few sentences to describe the perspective more logically: We found xantho-
phores, melanophres, abundant iridophores and dermal collagen fibers is stripes of both species.
Moreover, in both species, the xanthophores coloring the yellow-red skin contain carotenoids, pter-
ins, and riboflavin, but the two species differ in the distribution of pigment cell types and pigment
diversity. Both Pseudemys concinna’s and T. scripta’s yellow chin and forelimb stripes contain xan-
thophores and iridophores, but P. concinna and T. scripta’s post-orbital region’s differ in cell-type
distribution. T. scripta’s post-orbital stripes contain xanthophores and iridiophores, while T. scripta’s
yellow-red post-orbital / zygomatic regions contain xanthophores only.
Revised as “Here we compare reflectance spectra, cellular, ultra- and nano- structure of colour-
producing elements, and pigment types in the freshwater turtles with contrasting courtship behav-
iour, Trachemys scripta and Pseudemys concinna. The two species differ in the distribution of pig-
ment cell-types and in pigment diversity. We found xanthophores, melanocytes, abundant
iridophores and dermal collagen fibres in stripes of both species. The yellow chin and forelimb stripes
of both P. concinna and T. scripta contain xanthophores and iridophores, but the post-orbital regions
of the two species differ in cell-type distribution. The yellow post-orbital region of P. concinna con-
tains both xanthophores and iridophores, while T. scripta has only xanthophores in the yellow-red
postorbital/zygomatic regions. Moreover, in both species, the xanthophores colouring the yellow-red
skin contain carotenoids, pterins, and riboflavin, but T.scripta has a higher diversity of pigments than
P. concinna.”
Introduction
Line 38: We predict that regions of the skin that males expose to females during courtship should
richer in pigment contents than regions not exposed during courtship. Omit the word ‘bright’ from
these predictions because in tri-stimulus theory brightness means the amount of total reflectance
coming off the integument and correlates inversely with increased pigment concentrations.
Revised as “We predict that regions of the skin that males expose during courtship to females should
be more conspicuous in colour and richer in pigment types than regions not exposed during court-
ship. Specifically, in P. concinna we expect the yellow chin to be sexually dichromatic, conspicuous,
and rich in pigment types compared to other skin surfaces. In T. scripta, on the other hand, we expect
all regions exposed during courtship, i. e. dorsal and ventral head and limbs, to be sexually dichro-
matic, conspicuous, and rich in pigment types. ”

Results
Page 10, Line 29: 1st sentence of 2nd full paragraph: Normalized averaged radial means of the Fou-
rier power spectra…’ This is a long, run-on sentence and should be broken into 2-3 sentences.
Why is the zygomatic region of P. concinnna abbreviated as YP? Wouldn’t it be more intuitive if it
were abbreviated ‘ZP’ (for zygomatic patch)? No other abbreviation has Y in it to mention color, and
in general the letters represent anatomical locations instead of color.
1)The long sentence – Revised. First two sentences in the paragraph now read as:
“Normalized average radial means of the Fourier power spectra for each region of P. concinna and T.
s. elegans are shown in Fig 14. Radial means of the Fourier power spectra of all examined regions of
both species show increased power values in the lowest spatial frequencies (< 0.0034 nm-1) com-
pared to spatial frequencies relevant to coherent scattering in the visible light (Fig. 14 a-f; supple-
mentary Fig. S5 a).”

Tables and Figures
Figure 3. Minor detail, but should the B1-and H1-based spectral variables (i.e. brightness and hue)
be written with the same format as the S1 variables? E.g., since S1.blueCBC, shouldn’t B1.CBC?
H1.CBC?
The S1.blueCBC means saturation in blue segment of visible wavelengths of the CBC region. Likewise,
hue of the CBC region is abbreviated H1CBC.

Fig 12. 1st sentence of caption should read: ‘Distribution of predicted reflectivity of reflecting plate-
lets of iridophores based on Fourier Analysis. (a)…’
Revised, however we have not used Fourier Analysis to predict reflectivity of reflecting platelets but
thin layer interference model. The caption now reads as: “Distribution of predicted reflectivity of
reflecting platelets of iridophores based on thin layer interference model.”
Reviewer: 2
I previously reviewed this paper. I commend the authors for resampling the skins for evidence of
riboflavin and drosopterin, a pteridine often found in lepidosaurians with red tones. I think that it
adds perspective to the paper.
I must qualify a comment I made in my past review. I pointed out that many of the pteridines the
authors found in the brightly-coloured surfaces of turtles were colourless and might not contribute
directly to skin colours we (humans) perceive as yellow or red. This led the authors to revise their
manuscript to try to explain the presence of colourless pteridines, which produced a treatment that
was not evenly convincing (see specific comment below). I will add another consideration to the
mix: since many of these “colourless” pteridines absorb in the UV and turtles can see in the UV (as
pointed out in the manuscript: p. 34, line 10), it is probably reasonable to assume that they would
produce/alter colours that turtles can see (unlike us).
We have revised the paragraph (according to comments bellow, please see specific responses there)
which now reads as follows:
“Steffen et al. [30] suggested that the yellow-red skin of C. picta and the yellow skin (but not the red
skin) of T. scripta contain small amounts of pterins. Our results show that both yellow and red re-
gions of turtle skin contain multiple types of pterins (Table 4). Red and orange colours are produced
in some lizards by drosopterin [119,120] which we have not found in turtles. However, yellowish iso-
xanthopterin and yellow xanthopterin are present in yellow-red regions of T. scripta. Xanthopterin
has been previously reported in yellow and red skin of Phelsuma lizards [16]. The yellow and red skin
regions of Phelsuma have identical pigment composition but differ in the cellular pH environment
which determines the colour of the skin [16]. Thus, it is possible that xanthopterin and isoxanthopter-
in could contribute to both yellow and red colour production in the skin in turtles due to differences in
the cellular pH among these regions. However, most of the pterins present in the skin of both species
of turtles are colourless compounds. Colourless biopterin and 6-pterin-COOH have been previously
described in the skin of M. japonica [32]. In lizards colourless pterins have been found in colourful
body regions. For example, biopterin has been detected in the yellow-red xanthophores of Phelsuma
spp. [16], and varying amounts of colourful and colourless pterins have been found in the yellow-
orange-red ventral colour morphs of the European wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) [72]. Since many of
these colourless pterins absorb in the UV range [16], which turtles can see [90.91], colourless pterins

may in fact affect colour perception in turtles. Moreover, although some pterins may be colourless
even to turtles, it may be difficult to separate their influence on colour production from that of col-
ourful pterins, because the colourful pterins are derived from colourless ones and vice versa. For ex-
ample, yellow sepiapterin is precursor of colourless biopterin (the precursor of yellow 7-oxobiopterin
and pterin) and colourless pterin, the precursor of yellowish isoxanthopterin and its isoform yellow
xanthopterin [121]. The content of all individual types of pterins thus depends on the availability of
their precursor pterins. The diversity of different pterin types may thus describe the differences be-
tween colourful skin regions better than the amount of any single pterin type. In addition to carote-
noids and pterins, we found riboflavin in all yellow and red regions of T. scripta. In P. concinna we
found riboflavin in the yellow CBC and FLBS but not in the yellow PM. Riboflavin is present in the yel-
low-red skin of various lizards and snakes but has never been reported in turtle skin [32,72,122].
Therefore, the yellow and red colours of the turtles examined here likely result from a complex inter-
play between carotenoids, pterins, and riboflavin.”
My main concern this time around is with the way the authors characterize birds in the last section
of the manuscript (“Significance for vertebrate skin colour evolution”). It is inaccurate to state that
birds lack pigment cells other than melanocytes. Birds may have largely lost pigments cells from
their integument as a result of the development of an outer covering of feathers, but they retained
most pigment cell types (e.g., xanthophores and iridophores) in their irises (Oliphant et al. 1992
Pigment Cell Res 5:367-371). I note that turtles probably have similar pigments cells in their irises
than they do in their integuments, since the color patterns on the face of turtles often continue un-
interrupted across the iris. I think that making a distinction between the pigment cells of the integ-
ument and those of the iris is inappropriate, since BOTH derive equally from neural crest cells (see
review on the origin of cells that form the eye in Williams and Bohnsack 2015 Birth Defects Research
105:87-95). The pigment cells in the irises of birds may no longer have dendritic projections and
motile pigment organelles (and thus might be more appropriately called xanthocytes and iridocytes),
but that is beside the point.
Thank you very much for emphasizing this to us.
I (JB) have read the suggested paper of Oliphant and colleagues carefully and indeed you are right
and it is important to notice. I have always considered it as rather special case of few species. It is
very interesting problem. Of course, birds seem to maintain some regulatory mechanisms leading to
differentiation of xanthophores contrary to mammals (Kimura, T., Nagao, Y., Hashimoto, H., Yama-
moto-Shiraishi, Y. I., Yamamoto, S., Yabe, T., ... & Naruse, K. (2014). Leucophores are similar to xan-
thophores in their specification and differentiation processes in medaka. Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, 111(20), 7343-7348.). Yet it seems reasonable to assume that the integu-
mental and iridial pigment cells will differ to some extent (not only in morphology, but also in devel-
opmental origin – different parts of neural crest, and possibly in regulatory mechanisms) and it thus
make sense to me to discuss the integumental pigmentation as such.
We have revised the last section. Please see the MS for details.

the pigments not detected in any sample, but this should be made clearer. Please revise the text.
Revised as: “The yellow CBC and FLBS of both lineages of T. scripta and the ZP of T. s. scripta contain
6-biopterin, pterin-6-COOH, isoxanthopterin, leucopterin, d-neopterin, and xanthopterin, but not
pterin. “

the production of yellow-red colours in birds, maybe not in their integument, but in the iris.

noids are involved in the production of the yellow-red skin colours, which had not been clearly docu-

We have added sentence: “Since many of these colourless pterins absorb in the UV range [16], which
turtles can see [90.91], colourless pterins may be in fact colourful to turtles.”
Page 36 lines 1-2: I find this suggestion highly speculative and a bit far-fetched.
We have removed the sentence: “It is thus possible that colourless pterins influence the pH environ-

the iris.

odiles are not organized into stacked continuous layers and their putative iridophores contain amor-
phous material rather than reflecting platelets [86]. Cells with lipid vesicles suspected to contain ca-
rotenoids have been reported in both the epidermis and the dermis of non-feathered bare skin of
some bird taxa [18,152], but this association probably evolved secondarily and does not involve pig-
ment cells but other cell types [151]. Even though xanthophores, iridophores, and a broad diversity of
pigment cells with unusual pigment vesicles are present in the irises of birds, these cell types are not
present in the skin of birds [151].”

ins acting together to produce colour in the skin of any archelosaur.”

with carotenoids to yellow-red colours, again in the iris.
Revised.
Page 38, line 22: This is incorrect. Some birds possess xanthophores in their irises (unless you want
to be technical and call those xanthocytes).
Revised. The sentence now reads as follows “It remains open question whether the loss of xantho-
phores in the skin of avian archelosaurs led to rare occurrence of pterins in the skin and feathers.”
Figure 9. I am still not 100% sure that the vesicles in 9e (not 9c in my previous review, my mistake)
are oil droplets. They do appear to show some internal structure.
It is true that vesicles in 9c seem to have internal structure compared to vesicles in 9d (there are no
oil droplets as these have apparent plasmatic membrane). We have removed “, there is no pro-
nounced structure visible inside these vesicles. In context of chemical analysis, it seems these vesicles
contain predominantly yellow carotenoids“ from the figure caption.
