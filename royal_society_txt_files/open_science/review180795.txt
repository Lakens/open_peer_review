yellow R on the removal of nutrients. They found that high concentration of alizarin yellow R
exhibits opposite influence in nutrients removal. However, detailed discussion on mechanism
was lacking. On the other and, this work did not show distinctive improvements compared to
previously reported works. And thus, the insufficient novelty makes this submission
unrecommended for publication in Royal Society Open Science with its present form.
1. Why alizarin yellow R with high concentration decreases the nutrients removal efficiency? The
possible mechanism and corresponding characterizations need to be provided.
2. To study the universality, some other nutrients need to be investigated.
3. Data analysis needs to be treated carefully. For example, the nitrogen removal efficiency at 200
mg/L alizarin yellow R was 41.1% in abstract, while it became 82.4% in results and discussions.

and Cheng Ding, can be accepted for publishing in the Royal Society Open Science Journal, after
major revision.
In this study, the potential disrupting effects of Azo dye on wastewater nutrients removal was
analyzed, during of 15 days exposure experiments. The alizarin yellow R (AYR) was used as a
model dye to determine whether the dye caused adverse effects on biological removal of both the
dye and nutrients in acclimated anaerobic-aerobic-anoxic sequencing batch reactors. The
manuscript presents original results, which are relatively well organized and systematized.
Unfortunately the interpretation of experimental results is very poor, and this aspect must be
corrected before that the manuscript to be accepted for publication.
Here is a list of my comments:
1. All the abbreviations must be explained first.
2. Page 4, lines 5-8: “Apparently, the decolorization efficiency of the SBRs was negatively related
to the inlet concentration of AYR and more than 200 mg/L of inlet AYR was too much for the
SBR reactor to handle.” An appropriate interpretation of the experimental data must be added
here. Only general observations are not enough. For exemplification can see the paper: Possible
utilization of PET waste as adsorbent for Orange G dye removal from aqueous media,
Desalination and Water Treatment, 104 (2018) 338–345.

Appendix A
Thanks for the reviewer’s comments. We have revised the manuscript according to
the reviewer’s suggestions. The changes made in the manuscript are listed below:
Reviewer: 1
The removal of pollutants from wastewater is regarded as one of the most active
domains of research in water treatment and environmental monitoring, and the
investigation of mechanisms of effective removal is essential. In this work, Ding et
al. studied the effect of alizarin yellow R on the removal of nutrients. They found
that high concentration of alizarin yellow R exhibits opposite influence in nutrients
removal. However, detailed discussion on mechanism was lacking. On the other
and, this work did not show distinctive improvements compared to previously
reported works. And thus, the insufficient novelty makes this submission
unrecommended for publication in Royal Society Open Science with its present
form. (To this magazine, novelty is not needed to be commented, its just need to be
right.)
1.Why alizarin yellow R with high concentration decreases the nutrients removal
efficiency? The possible mechanism and corresponding characterizations need to be
provided. (The alizarin yellow R is poisonous to microbial cells, which may lead to
the damage of the cell and result in the decrease of nutrients removal. ROS, LDH
and enzymes activities could used to describe the extent of damage. We mainly
discussed these on 4.4, and the possible mechanism was also given on 4.4.)
2.To study the universality, some other nutrients need to be investigated. (The C
and N are the main nutrients related to wastewater treated. We has investigated C
and N in the paper.
3.Data analysis needs to be treated carefully. For example, the nitrogen removal
efficiency at 200 mg/L alizarin yellow R was 41.1% in abstract, while it became
82.4% in results and discussions. (The mistake was changed.)
Reviewer: 2 Comments to the Author(s) Manuscript entitled “Effects of azo dye on
simultaneous biological nutrients removal” submitted by Aihui Chen, Bairen Yang,
Yuanqiang Zhou and Cheng Ding, can be accepted for publishing in the Royal Society
Open Science Journal, after major revision. The manuscript presents original results,
which are relatively well organized and systematized, but unfortunately their
presentation is too poor, and this significantly reduces the practical importance of
the study.
Here is a list of my comments:
1.Page 3, line 55, 4.1. AYR Decolorization in simultaneous biological wastewater
treatment system: The presentation of experimental results is not enough, please
explain them. (We add the describe of the experimental results, and made some
explain.)
2.Page 4, lines 11-12, 4.2. The fate of AYR decolorized products PPD and 5-ASAAfate
in the wastewater treatment wastewater treatment system: The same observation
as above. (We add the describe of the experimental results, and made some
explain.)
3.Page 4, line 13: “PPD and 5-ASA were the two main products of AYR decolorization
in the anaerobic reduction.”. How has this observation been proven? According with
the studies from literature, since the references have to be added in this case, or
these compounds were identified by specific analyses, since in this case these
details should be mentioned in the text. (References were added.)
4. Page 4, line 24, 4.3. Effects of AYR on COD and nitrogen removal: The
experimental results presented in this section must be more detailed interpreted.
(We add the describe of the experimental results, and made some explain.)
5. Page 4, line 51, 4.4 Mechanisms of AYR affecting AYR and nitrogen removal: A
more detailed explanation of the obtained results must be provided here. (We
detailed the explanation.)
6. Page 5, lines 2-3: “Recent studies have suggested that the successful
decomposition of azo dyes into aromatic amines due to sufficient electron donor
source [22].” Here additional references should be added. (We changed the
describe from “Recent studies have” to “Recent study has”.)
Appendix B
Dear Thomas,
Firstly, thanks for the comments. We have revised the paper
according to the comments of the reviewers. If the followed
explanations are not enough, could you please let us know? Thanks in
advance.
Reviewer: 2
Manuscript entitled “Effects of azo dye on simultaneous biological
removal of azo dye and nutrients in wastewater” submitted by Aihui Chen,
Bairen Yang, Yuanqiang Zhou, Yuze Sun, and Cheng Ding, can be accepted
for publishing in the Royal Society Open Science Journal, after major
revision. In this study, the potential disrupting effects of Azo dye on
wastewater nutrients removal was analyzed, during of 15 days exposure
experiments. The alizarin yellow R (AYR) was used as a model dye to
determine whether the dye caused adverse effects on biological removal of
both the dye and nutrients in acclimated anaerobic-aerobic-anoxic
sequencing batch reactors. The manuscript presents original results, which
are relatively well organized and systematized. Unfortunately the
interpretation of experimental results is very poor, and this aspect must be
corrected before that the manuscript to be accepted for publication.
Response: We improved the the interpretation of the experimental
results.
Here is a list of my comments:
1. All the abbreviations must be explained first.
Response: we explained all the abbreviations firstly. For example, in
page 1, line 31 “SBRs” , page 1, line 41 “chemical oxygen demand (COD) ” ,
and page 2, line 30 “reactive oxygen species (ROS)” were added.
2. Page 4, lines 5-8: “Apparently, the decolorization efficiency of the
SBRs was negatively related to the inlet concentration of AYR and more
than 200 mg/L of inlet AYR was too much for the SBR reactor to handle.”
An appropriate interpretation of the experimental data must be added here.
Only general observations are not enough. For exemplification can see the
paper: Possible utilization of PET waste as adsorbent for Orange G dye
removal from aqueous media, Desalination and Water Treatment, 104 (2018)
338–345.
Response: In this paragraph, we only wanted to show the relationship of
AYR with its decolorization efficiency. And the interpretation of AYR
decolorization were exhibited in the next paragraph, as showed in page 4,
line 38- 48 ,“ Only about 4.1% and 3.8% of AYR were further transferred at
the aerobic and anoxic stages. ------ the anaerobic stage is the key step for
AYR decolorization. ------ The possible reasons were discussed in the next
section.”
3. Page 4, lines 35-36: “Therefore, it was concluded that AYR
decolorized to PPD and 5-ASA in the anaerobic stage is the key step of AYR
degradation.” Why??!!
Response: We expressed “why AYR decolorized to PPD and 5-ASA in
the anaerobic stage is the key step of AYR degradation”. In page 5, lines 2- 3,
“In both 50 and 200 mg/L inlet AYR concentrations, aerobic process
exhibited excellent PPD and 5-ASA degradation”was added,and in page 5,
lines 9- 13, “As the great quantity of PPD and 5-ASA produced in SBR2 in
the anaerobic stage were easy to be mineralized in the subsequent anaerobic
process, thus the step of PPD and 5-ASA mineralization was not an
important limiting step of the AYR mineralization. However, in SBR2, only
about 52.1% of AYR was transferred to PPD and 5-ASA” was added.
4. Page 4, 4.3. Effects of AYR on COD and nitrogen removal: Also, the
experimental results presented in this section must be more detailed
interpreted.
Response: We improved the interpretation of the nitrogen removal
process. In page 5, lines 53- 57 and page 6, lines 1- 7, “As shown in figure 2,
in SBR2, at the end of the anaerobic stage, 25.67 ± 1.59 mg/L of PPD and
34.15 ± 1.10 mg/L of 5-ASA accumulated in the wastewater, but only 0.67 ±
0.56 mg/L of PPD and 0.54 ± 1.24 mg/L of 5-ASA retained in the effluent.
Thus, in SBR2, it can be seen that about 25.0 mg/L of PPD and 33.6 mg/L of
5-ASA were mineralized at the aerobic and anoxic stage. In theory, complete
mineralization of 1 mg of PPD can produce 0.26 mg of NO3--N, and 1 mg of
5-ASA can produce 0.09 mg of NO3--N. The calculated NO3--N production
due to PPD and 5-ASA mineralization in the SBR2 was about 9.5 mg/L.
There was more 4.6 mg/L of NO3--N mineralized in the SBR2 than in the
control, which showed that the denitrification process was not depressed.”
were added.
