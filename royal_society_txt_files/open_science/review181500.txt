In this paper, the authors study a zigzag surface recursive lattice with a regular square lattice.
The zigzag structure is taken as a surface assembled by triangle units, and halved Husimi trees
are hung on the triangle units to represent the bulk portions. With the coordination number of 4
inside the bulk and average 3 on the surface, this model is considered to be a good approximation
to a regular square lattice with surface. The model is considered in the case of antiferromagnetic
interaction on the lattice and a uniform solution is obtained on the surface to represent the
ordered state. The thermodynamical properties of the model are also investigated and the
transition temperatures are found to be dramatically reduced on the surface comparing which in
the bulk. The effects of several interaction parameters on the system are investigated and these
interac tions could either increase or decrease the stability of system and change the transition
temperatures according to the Hamiltonian.
The overall impression of the paper is rather positive. The subject and method are quite clear, the
calculations are correct. Thus the paper can be published in its present form.

label_comment_2
I believe this paper should undergo major revisions before being properly reviewed as I have
several issues.
I should stress from the beginning these issues may be fundamental or they may be from
misunderstanding what is being discussed.
3
Neither case is optimal, but of course the latter may be fixed by addressing these
misunderstandings in the text.
The first issue concerns the usefulness of studying the recursive lattice (RL) in the context of the
regular square lattice (SL).
There does not seem to be any real argument or evidence that the RL is a reasonable
approximation to the SL, beyond mention of coordination numbers matching (and even then,
only on average on the surface).
Indeed, figure 3 would argue it is a bad approximation as x1_bulk and x2_bulk become equal
well beyond the transition temperature for the SL Ising model (~2.27).
Your removal of any connectivity (through the bulk) between each surface triangle does not seem
conducive to getting physical results; loops and connectivity are vital component of spin systems
on lattices.
In the SL there is one bulk which, if long range ordered, applies an effective field to the surface
forcing surface order.
Do you force each limb of the RL to apply the same effective field to each part of the surface,
despite the decoupling?
Clear physical statements need to be made about how the 1 bulk to many bulks approximation
impacts the problem.
The second is about the interpretation of your data.
I will focus on figure 5 to concreteness.
You argue (and I agree) that the 2-cycle solution cannot be physical above T = 1.33 and so the 1-
cycle solution describes the system.
However, I do not see any real evidence that it is not also just a numerical artefact below this
temperature and hence it crossing the 1-cycle solution does not necessarily indicate a phase
transition.
To clarify, I'm not saying it doesn't indicate a phase transition, only that I do not see evidence that
the 2-cycle goes from physically absurd to describing the system.
Third, and most easily remedied, is that I have some small mathematical issues.
In equation (6) I don't understand where the power of two comes from.
It appears all that is going on is to take equations (2) and (3) and set Z_i = B_i \bar{z_i}, which
would give the pre-factor as B_{m+1}B_B / B_m.
I'm happy to be wrong, but some explanation it is not what I think should appear in the paper if
so.
Also, I feel equation (12) would benefit from some additional explanation.
Finally, section IVB does not have any indication as to why someone would be interested in
adding and varying these parameters.
It seems like just tables of data with little justification.
I am not saying it is necessarily uninteresting or that it should not be included, just that it must be
justified.
There are also several writing based problems which hinder understanding.
While I would be happy to give a comprehensive list, I think it is inappropriate to do so before
the above issues are resolved and this document may be reviewed properly.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
Overall, I believe that while this paper needs some modifications, they are not as prohibitive as
previously thought.
As such I would recommend that it is accepted pending those changes.
I believe my initial objections are answered sufficiently by your likening of your approach to
mean-field theory.
That is, you believe that solving the recursive lattice problem provides the same sort of
information about the real square lattice model that mean-field theory would, but also that it
would do so with greater accuracy.
However, it would be useful for the reader to have this stated clearly very early on.
Otherwise they may worry, as I did, about the applicability of exact statements on the recursive
lattice to the square lattice.
My second objection, concerning figure 3, remains.
I was perhaps not entirely clear - I was not talking about any Monte Carlo-esque methods but
rather exact results.
I view the two bulk calculations as being analogous to the magnetisation in the ferromagnetic
square lattice Ising model, albeit scaled and shifted.
I completely agree with what you say in your response: at zero temperature you would expect
perfect antiferromagnetism, and hence x1_bulk = 1, x2_bulk = 0; at low temperature these values
would be perturbed only slightly; at high temperature the spins are completely disordered and so
neighbours are equally likely to be aligned or anti-aligned, hence x1_bulk = x2_bulk = 0.5.
My query is about at what temperature the phase transition between order and disorder occurs.
We know from exact solutions that for the square lattice this occurs at Tc = 2/log(1+sqrt(2)) ~
2.27.
My objection was that figure 3 implies a transition temperature of 2.75, which is not all that close
to the known Tc.
You may argue that 2.75 is closer than what mean-field theory would predict, but this should be
stated for the reader.
Additionally, I wonder if anything can be said about why it is an overestimate; is this generic for
all results obtained in this manner?
Finally, I have attached a list of writing based suggestions you may wish to consider (see
Appendix B). This list is not comprehensive but will hopefully provide a useful starting point.

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
I believe this paper should undergo major revisions before being
properly reviewed as I have several issues.
I should stress from the beginning these issues may be fundamental or
they may be from misunderstanding what is being discussed.
Neither case is optimal, but of course the latter may be fixed by
addressing these misunderstandings in the text.
The first issue concerns the usefulness of studying the recursive lattice
(RL) in the context of the regular square lattice (SL).
There does not seem to be any real argument or evidence that the RL
is a reasonable approximation to the SL, beyond mention of
coordination numbers matching (and even then, only on average on the
surface).
R: For most cases, especially when involving complex structures, It is
not possible to solve arbitrary models on a square lattice so one is
forced to find approximated solutions. Usually, one attempts to solve
the model in a mean-field approximation. Ref. 9 establishes that
recursive lattice solutions are more reliable than the mean-field
solutions, especially for antiferromagnetic models. Indeed, recursive
lattice solutions have become the state-of-the art in statistical
mechanics.
The average coordination 3 is an approximation of zigzag surface itself,
instead of RL. Considering a regular 2D square lattice being diagonally
cut, a zigzag outlayer will reveal, like the second part of fig1 (Plus we
modified the fig1 a bit to make the zigzag on regular cleavage lattice
clearer).
Indeed, figure 3 would argue it is a bad approximation as x1_bulk and
x2_bulk become equal well beyond the transition temperature for the
SL Ising model (~2.27).
R: There might be some misunderstanding on Fig3. Because this is the
content of bulk Ising model, which is discussed in other previous reports
(Ref. 6 and 10 for example), so we did not talk too much on this. But
“x1_bulk and x2_bulk become equal well” makes perfect sense. Since
it is the antiferromagnetic system, below the Curie point (Tc), the spins
will undergo self-magnetization (even without an external field H), and
prefer the +-+-+-… alternating arrangement, which is the lowest energy
state. Therefore, the probability of + and – spins must be “equally well”.
Furthermore, the referee rising this confusion might because of that, in
other classical simulation works, such as Monte Carlo or MD, an
external field is necessary to induce the magnetization below Tc,
otherwise it has a chance to achieve a temporary metastable,
unpolarized state (which is the 1-cycle solution in our model). And the
external field would bias the x1_bulk and x2_bulk to be asymmetrical.
Actually, this is another small advantage of our calculation method, to
observe the self-magnetization without external field
We have added some discussions on Fig3, especially on the x_bulk, to
clarify similar confusions.
Your removal of any connectivity (through the bulk) between each
surface triangle does not seem conducive to getting physical results;
loops and connectivity are vital component of spin systems on lattices.
The referee is correct that connectivity is vital for correlations. This is
the price we pay for using the recursive approximation. However, we
account for the bulky influence by introducing the back field x_B in our
computation. The idea is to find a solution that is physically consistent
but not exact numerically. It is this idea of “physically consistent”
solution that is used to draw conclusions when discussing Fig. 5. It is
this point that has bothered the referee.
Although the connections between bulk trees are eliminated, since
each single bulky tree is infinite and has an independent circumstance
inside, the thermodynamic contributions of various structures such as
loops and so on can be counted inside the tree. The philosophy here is
very much like the mean-filed method, since the complex interaction
between components are so messed up and uncountable, we deduce
the effects to be a single factor on each site itself, as a “mean field”.
In the SL there is one bulk which, if long range ordered, applies an
effective field to the surface forcing surface order.
Do you force each limb of the RL to apply the same effective field to
each part of the surface, despite the decoupling?
Clear physical statements need to be made about how the 1 bulk to
many bulks approximation impacts the problem.
Like explained above, It is right that we do normalize the effect from
bulk to be a uniform factor, x_B, (very much like a “field”), We consider
this to be a reasonable treatment. However, under current framework
we cannot verify this or to quantify how bad it could be. But we may do
some Indirect comparisons with some other lattice models and even
experimental works on the similar problems. For example, another RL
for interface we had developed (Ref. 6), the MC work of polymer glass
transition on thin film (P. Doruker and W. L. Mattice, Macromolecules
1998, 31, 1418-1426), or MD works on similar systems (J.A Torres, P.
F. Nealey, and J. J. de Pablo, Phys Rev Lett 2000, 85, 15). Our results
are found to be quite comparable to theirs, as we all observed the
reduction of transition T, and even the reduction ratios are quite close
to the experimental results (J.A. Forrest, K. Dalnoki-Veress, J.R.
Dutcher, Phys. Rev. E 56. 1997. 5705.). However, this part is not very
relevant to the properties of the model itself, so we did not mention
these comparisons in the manuscript.
The second is about the interpretation of your data.
I will focus on figure 5 to concreteness.
You argue (and I agree) that the 2-cycle solution cannot be physical
above T = 1.33 and so the 1-cycle solution describes the system.
However, I do not see any real evidence that it is not also just a
numerical artefact below this temperature and hence it crossing the 1-
cycle solution does not necessarily indicate a phase transition.
To clarify, I'm not saying it doesn't indicate a phase transition, only that
I do not see evidence that the 2-cycle goes from physically absurd to
describing the system.
R: It is not clear why the referee thinks that the solution below T=1.33
is numerically suspect. The recursive numerical calculation is exact; we
always make sure that we have come to a fixed point, where the
numerical error is physically insignificant. The crossing of the free
energy is well beyond this physically insignificant “error.” It is the free
energy that determines which solution is thermodynamically relevant.
There is nothing wrong with a solution being unphysical in one region,
and only to become a physical one in another region.
Third, and most easily remedied, is that I have some small
mathematical issues.
In equation (6) I don't understand where the power of two comes from.
It appears all that is going on is to take equations (2) and (3) and set
Z_i = B_i \bar{z_i}, which would give the pre-factor as B_{m+1}B_B /
B_m.
I'm happy to be wrong, but some explanation it is not what I think should
appear in the paper if so.
Also, I feel equation (12) would benefit from some additional
explanation.
R: The referee is correct. With a careful check on our original notes,
here it is typo that the actual form should be B_{m+1}B_B / B_m, we
have corrected this. And we added some detailed discussions on eq12
to help audience to understand the “from and go” of eq12, and how the
thermals are calculated from PPFs..
Finally, section IVB does not have any indication as to why someone
would be interested in adding and varying these parameters.
It seems like just tables of data with little justification.
I am not saying it is necessarily uninteresting or that it should not be
included, just that it must be justified.
R: We have talked more on the motivation and meanings of more
adjustable parameters in the section IVB. Besides the interests in
mathematical puzzling and guessing, we always expect the theoretical
model to be able to mimic and study real systems. In this way, we
include the interactions of further range to make the model versatile to
describe various systems. With adjustable combinations of energy
parameters setup, we can manipulate the thermal behavior of system
and the transition temperatures, to better match the reality in particular
situation. In another word, theoretical modelings always face the
challenge to be correlated with experimental parameters, more
adjustable parameters may serve as useful tools for the purpose.
There are also several writing based problems which hinder
understanding.
While I would be happy to give a comprehensive list, I think it is
inappropriate to do so before the above issues are resolved and this
document may be reviewed properly.
R: We have reviewed the manuscript and polished the writings at
several points. Again, thanks the referee’s precious and helpful review
and we hope we have fulfilled all the concerns.

Appendix C
We sincerely appreciate the referee’s 2nd round review and very helpful
corrections. We have corrected the mistakes pointed, and reviewed the
manuscript again for language polish.
For the remaining concerns, we have also made some revisions. The
main change is some added introduction on the advantages of RL in
section I, to remind readers that recursive lattice and mean-field theory
are both approximation to the real lattice, while RL is believed to be with
greater accuracy in some situations.
And we added a discussion on the overestimate of RL method
comparing to exact results, but smaller than mean-field, which is the
last paragraph in section III.A. The referee is correct that this is a
necessary point to be addressed to readers, and the overestimate
seems to be generic, which were also observed in other works.
However, we have not studied this nature yet.
Thanks again.
