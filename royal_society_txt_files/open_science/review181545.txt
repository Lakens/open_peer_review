The manuscrift is poor in English in the current format. In many cases the present tense and past
tense were mixed.
There are quite some unclarified issues in the models used, for example the meaning of Cs in
clinical application, how the KMF acting point was identified? was it varied like the COP of GRF
during stance?
Cs was note clarified in the application. Did it have a specific clinical meaning or just a variable
used to produce changes in the results.
The standard deviation of some primary results are too high, the authors didn't present the GRF
and the walking speed, which made it hard to assess the quality of the data. Ideally a test and
retest reliability should have performed to assure the data quality.
Some results are hard to comprehend, such as the knee medial force is directly proportional to
the knee adduction moment, however the manuscript presented data curves that showed some
contrary results, In the KMF curves the second peak was much higher than the first peak,
however in the curves of KAM the first peak was much higher than the second. It is very hard to
understand the results as the force should be directly proportional to the knee adduction
moment.
Additionally, the KMF and KAM should have the similar variation trend, for example in the
KAM curves the KAM of the normal condition was the highest 2nd peak, the others was much
lower than it. Contrarily the KMF curves showed the VL Stim was the highest in the second peak,
which was hard for readers to understand.

General Comments
This paper presents an interesting idea, to alter the muscle force distribution using NMES during
walking as a potential intervention for medial tibiofemoral OA. However, there are a number of
concerns that limit the impact of this work and the conclusions that can be drawn. These concerns
are highlighted below.
The authors assume the use of the knee adduction moment (KAM), as a surrogate measure of the
medial force in the knee, as many others also do. However, the KAM is one of 6 inverse dynamic
loads and is not necessarily a good predictor of the medial contact force in the knee (KMF), as it
does not account for muscle activity across the joint. In the context of this paper, where you are
altering muscle forces using NMES would you expect to see a change in the KAM?
The addition of the parameter, ‘c’, seems to have the desired effect of changing the muscle force
distribution. However, the selection of the parameter value seems a little arbitrary. How is this
physiologically related to the relative increase in muscle force from NMES? Can this be estimated
by measurement of EMG, or other methods?
The changes in the KAM presented in Figure 7 show very large standard deviations and it is
interesting that there are statistically significant differences in the 2nd peak of the KAM between
the Normal and stim conditions. Although there might be statistical significance, these
differences might not be clinically meaningful. The same can be said about the change in ankle
adduction angle. A difference of 0.4 deg between the Normal and stim condition does not seems
to be clinically meaningful, nor does it appear to be within the accuracy of the measurement
system.
The authors conclude that NMES provides an opportunity to treat knee osteoarthritis. The
changes in KMF due to the stim condition was considered ‘not substantial’(page 12, line 57),
when compared to some other forms of gait adaptation or gait retraining in the literature. It
would be useful to have this discussion in the context of these other modifications. Furthermore,
the large variability seen in the KAM results (which reflects the variability you might expect
across a patient cohort), demonstrates that perhaps this intervention would work for some
individuals, but not others. It would be nice if the simulation could identify which patient might
be well-suited to this intervention.
There is no discussion regarding the potential changes in the flexion-extension moments
following stimulation of each muscle. I also anticipated some discussion regarding the
stimulation of combined muscles, which might not change the net joint moment, but together
might have a greater impact on KMF than stimulating each muscle independently.
The authors conclude that the stimulated muscle forces were significantly increased and the KMF
was significantly decreased. Without stating the magnitude of these changes, a reader is left with
the opinion that these differences were considerable, which is misleading. Furthermore, the
evidence to support these statements is not entirely convincing. Firstly, the findings presented
regarding muscle force were taken from a model in which the cost function was altered to
achieve a desired result of redistributing the muscle force. Secondly, the authors previously state
in the discussion that the resulting KMF from the stim conditions were ‘not substantial’.
Specific Comments
1. Abstract. It would be good to have some quantitative measure of the amount of change in the
peak knee medial force, rather than just stating the difference was statistically significant. What
was the absolute and/or percentage change? The authors state that there was a strong correlation
between knee medial force and knee adduction moment, but again, it would be useful to
illustrate the strength of this correlation by supporting the statement with evidence (i.e. an R^2 =
4
0.9).
2. Page 3. Line 5. The authors cite a few papers from their own research group here, but this does
not really reflect the large efforts that are ongoing amongst the computational biomechanics
community to use musculoskeletal modelling to estimate internal forces.
3. Page 3 line 11. In vivo measurement of knee contact forces suggests that there is rather poor
evidence of the efficacy of valgus bracing and lateral wedges to reduce knee loading (Kutzner, I.,
Küther, S., Heinlein, B., Dymke, J., Bender, A., Halder, A. M., & Bergmann, G. (2011). The effect of
valgus braces on medial compartment load of the knee joint - in vivo load measurements in three
subjects. Journal of Biomechanics, 44(7), 1354–1360; and Kutzner, I., Damm, P., Heinlein, B.,
Dymke, J., Graichen, F., & Bergmann, G. (2011). The effect of laterally wedged shoes on the
loading of the medial knee compartment-in vivo measurements with instrumented knee
implants. Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 29(12), 1910–1915.). The efficacy of such devices to
influence clinical symptoms might be different, but the evidence provided by the authors to claim
that there is good support for reducing medial tibiofemoral joint contact forces is not ‘firm’.
4. Page 4. Line 18. The authors use computational models to estimate the knee force, which is not
a ‘direct estimation’, but rather an indirect one.
5. Page 4 Line 21. It is not clear how the use of the knee adduction moment (KAM) improves the
reliability of the results? The KAM provides an ‘easy to measure’ surrogate of the KMF, but only
represents one of 6 inverse dynamic loads and does not account for muscle co-contraction. As
such, the KAM is not necessarily a strong predictor of KMF.
6. Page 5. Line 10. It seems like the timing of the increased muscle activation might be important,
given these muscles also play a role in developing flexion-extension moments? This might be
worth mentioning.
7. Page 6. Line 37. It is unclear how Equation (1) shows a force-endurance relationship from
Crowninshield and Brand (1981), as it merely implies a ratio of a maximum muscle force?
8. Page 7. Line 16. What are the 5 vectors of reaction forces? These should be explicitly stated
here.
9. Page 8. Line 16. Suggest restructuring sentence.
10. Page 8. Line 22. This is an unusual Euler sequence of rotations. Typically you select the degree
of freedom that has the greatest motion as the first rotation (i.e. flexion-extension). Doing
otherwise might result in greater kinematic crosstalk.
11. Page 9. Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4. When describing results, the authors commonly state
‘significantly larger’, however, do not present any statistical evidence for these statements.
12. Page 10. Line 10. It is not clear whether the decreased ankle abduction observed in the
experiment resulted directly in a reduction of medial knee contact force, as suggested. This
finding represents an association and not a causation.
13. Page 13. Line 3. Using a lower value of cs in the cost function resulted in an ‘obvious
reduction in KMF’, however, how realistic or physiological would this be?
14. Page 13 line 29. The statement that the ankle adduction angle and KAM ‘strengthened the
reliability’ of the KMF decrease due to latGAS stim is a hypothesis and should maybe be
presented in discussion, not the conclusion. Compared to the ‘Normal’ condition, the change in
adduction was only 0.4 degrees (with a SD of 2.1 degrees), which is likely below the accuracy
level of the kinematic model.

At my request, the authors revised the manuscript quite significantly. They removed two subjects
and added some requested information such as GRF.
The muscle forces do affect the joint forces based on the biomechanical structures. However
speed, accelerations and ground reaction forces have more significant impact to the knee joint
forces. Understandably, high speed would result in higher acceleration, higher ground reaction
force and eventually joint force. The biomechanical modelling method might be a good way to
quantify the knee joint forces, but a good validation must be presented. The reported work
involved some serious questions in the data that concerned me. In the data table 5, the walking
speeds in different conditions were recorded as from 0.71 to 0.78, which was 10% variation and
quite common due to the difficulties of controlling it. However the first peak of the ground
reaction forces from the same four conditions were recorded as identical 0.09, 0.12 and 0.98,
which were incomprehensible. Future more, the GRF curves indicated the variations of the four
conditions. The vertical GRF from the curves clearly indicated the first peaks were higher than
1.0, no idea why the authors reported as 0.98? Lower than a body mass can hardly be treated as
normal walking of normal subjects. I don’t know whether to trust table or curves. Before such
inportant questions are clarified, it is hard to discuss the outcome of the paper.

The authors have taken on the reviewers comments and made significant changes to the
manuscript, which is now easier to understand and the conclusions are within scope of the actual
findings. I have only a few minor comments:
1. The description of the normalized force-endurance relationship formula (in response to point 7
10
of my initial review) was a useful addition for me to understand where this relationship came
from. I would suggest including this in the appendix.
2. Page 2 line 50. The authors refer to KAM here as the "knee abduction moment", when I believe
it should be the knee ADDUCTION moment (externally applied).

Dear Dr Xu,
Thank you for your substantial improvements to your manuscript, which have been noted by the
reviewers. One reviewer has highlighted a serious discrepancy in the new data that you present,
namely Table 5 and Figure 7, and has stated, correctly, that they cannot review the interpretations
of the manuscript until the discrepancy is corrected. In particular, the table values of the GRF
peaks do not match the peaks in the traces, which casts into doubt the veracity of all the data.
Please provide a revision that presents correct and consistent data, and which addresses the
reviewer's concerns about validation and that peak GRF < 1 BW cannot represent normal
walking.

which were incomprehensible. Future more, the GRF curves indicated the variations of the four
conditions. The vertical GRF from the curves clearly indicated the first peaks were higher than
1.0, no idea why the authors reported as 0.98? Lower than a body mass can hardly be treated as
normal walking of normal subjects. I don’t know whether to trust table or curves. Before such
inportant questions are clarified, it is hard to discuss the outcome of the paper.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have taken on the reviewers comments and made significant changes to the
manuscript, which is now easier to understand and the conclusions are within scope of the actual
findings. I have only a few minor comments:
1. The description of the normalized force-endurance relationship formula (in response to point 7
of my initial review) was a useful addition for me to understand where this relationship came
from. I would suggest including this in the appendix.
2. Page 2 line 50. The authors refer to KAM here as the "knee abduction moment", when I believe
it should be the knee ADDUCTION moment (externally applied).

Quite several issues were not properly defined or clarified:
• It seems the gait test had a systematic problem (Table 5). Normally for healthy subjects the first
14
peak of GRF should be larger than the body weight due to accelerations. When walking is not
normal, smaller peak can happen, but the walking would be purposely controlled (limping). Or,
to GRF peak 1 less than bodyweight they must be having a very short single support with a long
double support which basically means the other limb is taking more of the bodyweight.
I noticed the following explanation of the authors “The peak values mentioned in the manuscript
are calculated as the mean values of 20%~35% and 70%~85% of the stance phase, at the same
timing as the peak KMFs. Therefore, this mean value is lower than the maximum peak. We have
added a clearer explanation in Section 3.4:“The peak GRFs were defined as those at the same
timing as the peak KMFs. Specifically, these were calculated as the mean values across 20%-35%
and 70%-85% of the stance phase.”
However, the mean curve showed clearly the peak 1 is higher than a body weight, then GRFy
value could not be less than a body mass as they were listed in the table if the peak1 was
calculated as the mean of each peak 1of each individual trial unless very bad trials were included
in the calculation but not in the mean curve. The mean curves of GRF look quite normal and
typical. Only the peak 1 needs to be checked.
• The paper didn’t report the computation method in detail, such as marker placement and
software design, software validation. It is hard for readers to build up their confidence in the
results they presented. For example, during normal walking the knee joint force (resultant force)
at peak one would not be as high as 1.51 times of body weight and 2.32 times of body weight for
medial side of the knee only. I strongly recommend the authors validate their calculation results
with other commercial software such as OPEN SIMM or VIUSAL3D (C-Motion, USA) on normal
condition and then perform the other calculations.
• Normally KAM is directly proportional to GRFy, a higher GRF peak would produce a higher
Kam. The results from this paper showed different results GRFy Peak1=0.97, Peak2=1.08, resulted
in the peak 1 and 2 of KAM as 2.07±0.24 1.85±0.60, which were difficult to comprehend. The
model and calculation method should be checked.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript is poor in English in the current format. In many cases the present
tense and past tense were mixed.
Response:
We apologise for this and have conducted a thorough review of the language
used, resulting in a major re-write of the paper.
There are quite some unclarified issues in the models used, for example the
meaning of Cs in clinical application, how the KMF acting point was identified?
Was it varied like the COP of GRF during stance? Cs was not clarified in the
application. Did it have a specific clinical meaning or just a variable used to
produce changes in the results.
Response:
We recognise that we have not been clear enough in our description of the model
used. In particular, we have now added a clearer description of the meaning of
Cs and how the KMF acting point was identified. The following sections of text
have been included:
However, as the tibiofemoral joint reaction force is compartmentalized into
a medial and a lateral component, the contact points of these two
compartments are different from the knee joint center of rotation, and they
were located according to the MR imaging data of the subject mentioned
above. The contact points were fixed to the shank segment and defined as the
points of action of the medial and lateral knee joint forces; these were the
middle of the most distal ends of the femoral condyles in the axial slice. These
positions will change on the thigh segment according to the translations
between two adjacent segments. The subjects’ contact points were obtained
by scaling these two points in the MR Imaging data to the subject’s shank using
the shank scaling factor.
The adjustable weighting factor, cs, enables the stimulated muscle force to
increase relative to standard simulation for a value of cs of less than 1.
Conversely, increasing cs to greater than 1 will result in under activation of the
muscle. As electrical stimulation recruits muscles directly, the combination of
voluntary contractions with electrical stimulation produces stronger
contraction (40) and so, clinically, cs is related to stimulation intensity and it is
used to produce changes in muscle forces. In order to explore the sensitivity of
cs on the muscle and joint forces, varying values of cs (1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1 and
0) were implemented. Finally, cs=0.1 for BF and cs=0.25 for latGAS and VL were
selected to produce a significant increase in muscle force during the NMES
simulation.
The standard deviation of some primary results are too high, the authors didn't
present the GRF and the walking speed, which made it hard to assess the quality
of the data. Ideally a test and retest reliability should have performed to assure
the data quality.
Response:
We have added data on GRF, walking velocity and step length. These are included
as Figure 7. Ground reaction force. GRFx: GRF in forward/backward direction;
GRFy: GRF in upward/downward direction; GRFz: GRF in rightward/leftward
direction, and Table 5. Ground reaction force, walking velocity and step length

Some results are hard to comprehend, such as the knee medial force is directly
proportional to the knee adduction moment, however the manuscript presented
data curves that showed some contrary results, In the KMF curves the second
peak was much higher than the first peak, however in the curves of KAM the first
peak was much higher than the second. It is very hard to understand the results
as the force should be directly proportional to the knee adduction moment.
Additionally, the KMF and KAM should have the similar variation trend, for
example in the KAM curves the KAM of the normal condition was the highest 2nd
peak, the others was much lower than it. Contrarily the KMF curves showed the
VL Stim was the highest in the second peak, which was hard for readers to
understand.
Response:
There is certainly a correlation (shown in the literature) between the knee
adduction moment and medial knee force, however, these are not necessarily
directly proportional to one another as the equations of motion demonstrate. We
have included further comment and discussion on this throughout the
manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
General Comments
This paper presents an interesting idea, to alter the muscle force distribution
using NMES during walking as a potential intervention for medial tibiofemoral OA.
However, there are a number of concerns that limit the impact of this work and
the conclusions that can be drawn. These concerns are highlighted below.
The authors assume the use of the knee adduction moment (KAM), as a surrogate
measure of the medial force in the knee, as many others also do. However, the
KAM is one of 6 inverse dynamic loads and is not necessarily a good predictor of
the medial contact force in the knee (KMF), as it does not account for muscle
activity across the joint. In the context of this paper, where you are altering
muscle forces using NMES would you expect to see a change in the KAM?
Response:
We apologise for the lack of clarity: we have not used KAM as a surrogate
measure of the medial force in the knee. We agree that KAM is not a good
predictor of KMF, as the relationship between the two parameters is complex. We
have included an additional analysis of KAM to help understand the
biomechanical change of knee under NMES.
The addition of the parameter, ‘c’, seems to have the desired effect of changing
the muscle force distribution. However, the selection of the parameter value
seems a little arbitrary. How is this physiologically related to the relative increase
in muscle force from NMES? Can this be estimated by measurement of EMG, or
other methods?
Response:
EMG signals are affected by the stimulation artefacts caused by the stimulation
current when NMES is used. This has been partially addressed in the literature
with, for example, use of an EMG-amplifier with shut-down control, advanced
filtering procedures, and optimising the positioning of the EMG electrodes in
relation to the stimulation electrodes. However, these approaches do not fully
eliminate the stimulation artefacts and we were, therefore, unable to use EMG
as a validation of the method. We have added the following:
EMG signals are affected by the stimulation artefacts caused by the
stimulation current when NMES is used. This has been partially addressed in
the literature with, for example, use of an EMG-amplifier with shut-down
control (42), advanced filtering procedures (43), and optimising the
positioning of the EMG electrodes in relation to the stimulation electrodes
(44). However, these approaches do not fully eliminate the stimulation
artefacts and we, therefore, were unable to use EMG as a validation of the
method.
Our selection of the parameter ‘c’ is therefore arbitrary and we have more
carefully articulated this in the manuscript.
Voluntary contractions preferentially recruit type I fibers, and then type II
fibers. This asynchronous activation of varied motor units is a physiological
mechanism that decreases muscle fatigue (40) . However, electrically elicited
contractions recruit motor units synchronously, and recruit motor units that
are not activated by voluntary contractions (40). It is deduced that
stimulated muscles produce larger forces than voluntary conditions, and the
other muscles contract in a way to decrease muscle fatigue. In view of this,
NMESsim was used with a parameter c to realise a reasonable muscle force
distribution: the stimulated muscle force was increased, and all the muscle
and joint forces satisfied the motor function constraints. The cs values were
chosen between 0 and 1 (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1), where cs=1 represents
the original cost function. Where the muscles are not saturated (i.e. limited
by their PCSA), assigning a value of cs of less than 1 enforces a greater muscle
force than when using the original cost function; a value of cs=0 assigns the
greatest activation to the muscle as this removes the muscle from the cost
function.
The changes in the KAM presented in Figure 7 show very large standard
deviations and it is interesting that there are statistically significant differences in
the 2nd peak of the KAM between the Normal and stim conditions. Although
there might be statistical significance, these differences might not be clinically
meaningful. The same can be said about the change in ankle adduction angle. A
difference of 0.4 deg between the Normal and stim condition does not seems to
be clinically meaningful, nor does it appear to be within the accuracy of the
measurement system.
Response:
We appreciated the reviewer’s comments on clinically meaningful differences
and have rewritten our results (we have now included walking velocity and step
length in our analysis).
The mean KAMs and KFMs are shown in Figure 6. The second peak of KAM
during loBF stimulated walking is significantly smaller than that during
normal walking (1.69 %BW*HT vs. 1.85 %BW*HT, p=0.016, Table 4).
However, peak KFM does not change with NMES.
3.4. Ground Reaction Forces, Walking Velocity and Step Length
GRF is presented in Figure 7. There was no statistical difference in peak
GRFs, walking velocity and step length between NMES stimulated and
normal walking (Table 5).
A comment on the clinical interpretation of this work has been included:
The significant decrease of KAM by loBF stimulation was consistent with
that of KMF. A study of 62 OA patients verified the clinical importance of KAM
in that peak KAM and KAM impulse explained variance in knee cartilage
thickness (47). However, whether the change of KAM could contribute to the
alleviation of OA symptoms needs clinical validation.
The authors conclude that NMES provides an opportunity to treat knee
osteoarthritis. The changes in KMF due to the stim condition was considered ‘not
substantial’ (page 12, line 57), when compared to some other forms of gait
adaptation or gait retraining in the literature. It would be useful to have this
discussion in the context of these other modifications. Furthermore, the large
variability seen in the KAM results (which reflects the variability you might expect
across a patient cohort), demonstrates that perhaps this intervention would work
for some individuals, but not others. It would be nice if the simulation could
identify which patient might be well-suited to this intervention.
Response:
This is certainly an important point and we have added the following to the
discussion:
The decrease in KMF due to NMES is not substantial compared to the
reduction caused by other methods. Kinney et al quantified KMF reduction
through gait modification using long hiking poles with wide pole placement,
and found that KMF at 75% stance decreased significantly from 1.35 BW to
0.89 BW (46). Other modifications in Kinney’s study, such as mild crouch and
medial thrust, did not show any significant KMF reduction. Orthotic
interventions using a lateral foot wedge and valgus knee brace, resulted in a
decrease in model-estimated peak tibiofemoral load with increasing wedge
size and applied valgus brace moment (7). A higher level of activation using
NMES might be required to create a greater reduction in KMF.
Although some of variables were not significantly different between
groups, this does not negate the fact that changes can be significant for an
individual. Table 3 lists how peak KMF varies for 8 subjects and although the
KMF decrease for the group is not substantial, the simulation could be used
to identify which patient is well-suited to this intervention.
There is no discussion regarding the potential changes in the flexion-extension
moments following stimulation of each muscle. I also anticipated some discussion
regarding the stimulation of combined muscles, which might not change the net
joint moment, but together might have a greater impact on KMF than stimulating
each muscle independently.
Response:
The following has been added to the discussion:
This study simulated the situations where only one muscle was stimulated.
However, it is possible that the stimulation of combined muscles will not
change the net joint moment, but together have a greater impact on KMF
than stimulating each muscle independently. This case should be considered
further.
The muscle forces of loBF, latGAS and VL generate movement of the lower
limb mainly through changing the flexion-extension moments of the knee
and ankle. The extra muscle activation by NMES may influence the periodic
characteristics of normal gait. In this way, different timing of NMES leads to
different gait characteristics, and will affect the reduction of KMF. Therefore,
NMES timing is an important parameter for precise control of NMES. This
study utilised a very crude manually-implemented timing mechanism that
should be tuned for optimal outcome.
The authors conclude that the stimulated muscle forces were significantly
increased and the KMF was significantly decreased. Without stating the
magnitude of these changes, a reader is left with the opinion that these
differences were considerable, which is misleading. Furthermore, the evidence to
support these statements is not entirely convincing. Firstly, the findings
presented regarding muscle force were taken from a model in which the cost
function was altered to achieve a desired result of redistributing the muscle force.
Secondly, the authors previously state in the discussion that the resulting KMF
from the stim conditions were ‘not substantial’.
Response:
We have toned down our conclusions and reported the magnitude of the
changes::
A new cost function for use in musculoskeletal models, NMESsim, has
been proposed to allow the quantification of muscle forces when they are
stimulated by external means. This was tested in living subjects, and our
results show that the stimulated muscle forces are significantly increased
(loBF: <U+F044>=0.07 BW, p=0.039; latGAS: <U+F044>=0.27 BW, p=0.008; VL: <U+F044>=0.40 BW,
p=0.008), and the peak values of knee joint medial loading are significantly
decreased by applying NMES to loBF (NMESsim: <U+F044>=0.17 BW, p=0.016).
Specific Comments
1. Abstract. It would be good to have some quantitative measure of the amount
of change in the peak knee medial force, rather than just stating the
difference was statistically significant. What was the absolute and/or
percentage change? The authors state that there was a strong correlation
between knee medial force and knee adduction moment, but again, it would
be useful to illustrate the strength of this correlation by supporting the
statement with evidence (i.e. an R^2 = 0.9).
Response:
Thank you for these suggestions. We have revised the text in the abstract as
follows and have made other changes throughout the text:
Stimulation of the biceps femoris resulted in a significant decrease in the
second peak of the medial knee joint by up to 0.1 BW (p=0.016).
2. Page 3. Line 5. The authors cite a few papers from their own research group
here, but this does not really reflect the large efforts that are ongoing
amongst the computational biomechanics community to use
musculoskeletal modelling to estimate internal forces.
Response:
We have amended this section as follows:
Some musculoskeletal models are driven by electromyography (EMG)
measurements, however, NMES stimulus contaminates EMG (27) meaning
that this approach cannot be used. Other methods are based on static
optimization (28-31) that use cost functions that minimize muscle fatigue
(32), defined as the sum of cubed muscles stresses.

3. Page 3 line 11. In vivo measurement of knee contact forces suggests that
there is rather poor evidence of the efficacy of valgus bracing and lateral
wedges to reduce knee loading (Kutzner, I., Küther, S., Heinlein, B., Dymke, J.,
Bender, A., Halder, A. M., & Bergmann, G. (2011). The effect of valgus braces
on medial compartment load of the knee joint - in vivo load measurements

effect of laterally wedged shoes on the loading of the medial knee
compartment - in vivo measurements with instrumented knee implants.
Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 29(12), 1910–1915.). The efficacy of such
devices to influence clinical symptoms might be different, but the evidence
provided by the authors to claim that there is good support for reducing
medial tibiofemoral joint contact forces is not ‘firm’.
Response:
We have toned down this section to the following:
It has been shown that gait modification by varying the external forces on
the knee through valgus bracing and lateral wedges can increase the knee
abduction moment (KAM) and/or shift the center of pressure of the ground
reaction force laterally (4-7). These measures are surrogates of the medial
knee contact forces (KMF) and the efficacy of these approaches is highly
dependent on the individual subject (8, 9).
4. Page 4. Line 18. The authors use computational models to estimate the knee
force, which is not a ‘direct estimation’, but rather an indirect one.
Response:
The sentence has been rewritten:
Therefore, in this study a modified static optimization cost function is
proposed to estimate KMF in NMES-assisted gait.
5. Page 4 Line 21. It is not clear how the use of the knee adduction moment
(KAM) improves the reliability of the results? The KAM provides an ‘easy to
measure’ surrogate of the KMF, but only represents one of 6 inverse dynamic
loads and does not account for muscle co-contraction. As such, the KAM is
not necessarily a strong predictor of KMF.
Response:
We agree with this point and have rewritten this section:
The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that extra excitation of the
lateral leg muscles (i.e. loBF, latGAS and VL) can reduce KMF during level
walking, where KMF is quantified through the use of the newly proposed cost
function in a validated musculoskeletal model (23). This is then compared
with the commonly-used surrogate of KMF, the KAM, and finally, the input
kinematic and kinetic data are analyzed to explain the results.
6. Page 5. Line 10. It seems like the timing of the increased muscle activation
might be important, given these muscles also play a role in developing
flexion-extension moments? This might be worth mentioning.
Response:
We agree that this is certainly potentially important and we have amended the
discussion to include the following:
The muscle forces of loBF, latGAS and VL generate movement of the lower
limb mainly through changing the flexion-extension moments of the knee and
ankle. The extra muscle activation by NMES may influence the periodic
characteristics of normal gait. In this way, different timing of NMES leads to
different gait characteristics, and will affect the reduction of KMF. Therefore,
NMES timing is an important parameter for precise control of NMES. This
study utilised a very crude manually-implemented timing mechanism that
should be tuned for optimal outcome.
7. Page 6. Line 37. It is unclear how Equation (1) shows a force-endurance
relationship from Crowninshield and Brand (1981), as it merely implies a ratio
of a maximum muscle force?
Response:
The normalized force-endurance relationship fomula is
<U+0001D45B>
<U+0001D453>
log <U+0001D447> = - log ( ) +<U+0001D450>
<U+0001D453><U+0001D45A><U+0001D44E><U+0001D465>
where T is the endurance time, c is a constant, f is the muscle force, fmax is the
maximal muscle force and n usually ranges from 2.54 to 3.14. The equation
<U+0001D453> <U+0001D45B>
illustrates that the endurance time increases as the relative muscle force ( )
<U+0001D453><U+0001D45A><U+0001D44E><U+0001D465>
decreases.
The muscle selection to maximize activity endurance is physiologically reasonable
during many normal activities. Therefore, the musculoskeletal model to mimic
muscle contraction for normal activities has to maximize muscle endurance,
<U+0001D453><U+0001D456> 3 <U+0001D453><U+0001D456> 3
which is realized by minimize <U+2211> ( ) , i.e., the sum of ( ) for all
<U+0001D453><U+0001D456><U+0001D45A><U+0001D44E><U+0001D465> <U+0001D453><U+0001D456><U+0001D45A><U+0001D44E><U+0001D465>
muscles.
8. Page 7. Line 16. What are the 5 vectors of reaction forces? These should be
explicitly stated here.
Response:
We have added the following:
5 vectors of joint reaction forces for ankle, lateral knee, medial knee, hip and
patellofemoral joints.
9. Page 8. Line 16. Suggest restructuring sentence.
Response:
This sentence has been deleted.
10. Page 8. Line 22. This is an unusual Euler sequence of rotations. Typically you
select the degree of freedom that has the greatest motion as the first rotation
(i.e. flexion-extension). Doing otherwise might result in greater kinematic
crosstalk.
Response:
This is a mistake and we apologise for this. We have corrected this in the
manuscript:
The sequence of angle calculation is first flexion/extension (plantar
flexion/dorsiflexion for the ankle), then external/internal rotation and lastly
abduction/adduction.
11. Page 9. Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4. When describing results, the authors
commonly state ‘significantly larger’, however, do not present any statistical
evidence for these statements.
Response:
The mean and p values have been added to the text as follows:
There was no significant difference between maximal muscle force values
in normal gait and stimulated walking when using the original cost function.
However, maximal muscle forces in the stimulated tasks were significantly
larger than the maximal muscle forces in normal gait when using NEMSsim
for stimulated walking (loBF: 0.27 BW vs. 0.20 BW, p=0.039; latGAS: 0.61 BW
vs. 0.34 BW, p=0.008; VL: 1.18 BW vs. 0.78 BW, p=0.008; Table 1).
3.3 Knee Forces and Moments
The mean KMFs are shown in Figure 5. Generally the KMF has two peaks
during the stance phase occurring at mean values of 28% and 78% of the
stance phase. However, two subjects do not have two explicit peaks.
Therefore, the mean KMFs of 20%-35% and 70%-85% of the stance phase are
calculated to represent the two peak values. The second peak KMF in loBF
stimulated walking is decreased significantly using the original cost function
(stimulated vs. normal: 2.26 BW vs. 2.32 BW, p=0.039) and NMESsim
(stimulated vs. normal: 2.15 BW vs. 2.32 BW, p=0.016) in Table 2. The peak
KMFs of each subject are shown in Table 3.
The mean KAMs and KFMs are shown in Figure 6. The second peak of KAM
during loBF stimulated walking is significantly smaller than that during
normal walking (1.69 %BW*HT vs. 1.85 %BW*HT, p=0.016, Table 4).
However, peak KFM does not change with NMES.
12. Page 10. Line 10. It is not clear whether the decreased ankle abduction
observed in the experiment resulted directly in a reduction of medial knee
contact force, as suggested. This finding represents an association and not a
causation.
Response:
Due to the very small statistical change, we have decided not to report the joint
angles. (And we agree with the reviewer.)
13. Page 13. Line 3. Using a lower value of cs in the cost function resulted in an
‘obvious reduction in KMF’, however, how realistic or physiological would this be?
Response:
This is not known and is a limitation of this manuscript. We have added the
following to the discussion:
The decrease of the KMF was limited by the increase of the muscle force,
which was determined by the cs value in the model. Lower cs values than
were applied in this study could be used to generate a greater reduction in
KMF. However, the clinical feasibility of including such high muscle forces is
not known.
14. Page 13 line 29. The statement that the ankle adduction angle and KAM
‘strengthened the reliability’ of the KMF decrease due to latGAS stim is a
hypothesis and should maybe be presented in discussion, not the conclusion.
Compared to the ‘Normal’ condition, the change in adduction was only 0.4
degrees (with a SD of 2.1 degrees), which is likely below the accuracy level of the
kinematic model.
Response:
The analysis of joint angles has been deleted as mentioned above. The conclusion
has been revised to the following:
A new cost function for use in musculoskeletal models, NMESsim, has
been proposed to allow the quantification of muscle forces when they are
stimulated by external means. This was tested in living subjects, and our
results show that the stimulated muscle forces are significantly increased
(loBF: <U+F044>=0.07 BW, p=0.039; latGAS: <U+F044>=0.27 BW, p=0.008; VL: <U+F044>=0.40 BW,
p=0.008), and the peak values of knee joint medial loading are significantly
decreased by applying NMES to loBF (NMESsim: <U+F044>=0.17 BW, p=0.016). This
study demonstrates that it is possible to redistribute the knee loading and
reduce the loading on the medial compartment by activating selected
muscles across the healthy knee and this opens the door for prevention and
alternative non-surgical interventions for knee OA.

Comments to the Author(s)
At my request, the authors revised the manuscript quite significantly. They
removed two subjects and added some requested information such as GRF.
The muscle forces do affect the joint forces based on the biomechanical structures.
However speed, accelerations and ground reaction forces have more significant
impact to the knee joint forces. Understandably, high speed would result in higher
acceleration, higher ground reaction force and eventually joint force. The
biomechanical modelling method might be a good way to quantify the knee joint
forces, but a good validation must be presented. The reported work involved some
serious questions in the data that concerned me. In the data table 5, the walking
speeds in different conditions were recorded as from 0.71 to 0.78, which was 10%
variation and quite common due to the difficulties of controlling it. However the
first peak of the ground reaction forces from the same four conditions were
recorded as identical 0.09, 0.12 and 0.98, which were incomprehensible. Future
more, the GRF curves indicated the variations of the four conditions. The vertical
GRF from the curves clearly indicated the first peaks were higher than 1.0, no idea
why the authors reported as 0.98? Lower than a body mass can hardly be treated
as normal walking of normal subjects. I don’t know whether to trust table or curves.
Before such important questions are clarified, it is hard to discuss the outcome of
the paper.
Response:
Dear reviewer, we apologise that some details are missed out.
As you noted at your last review, the KAM showed a very large standard deviation.
We therefore checked the KAM of all the 10 participants (figure 1 below), and
found that two of the participants have strange KAM outputs.
Figure 1. KAM of 10 participants. The two dashed lines indicate the abnormal
KAM of two participants.
After checking the animation of the kinematic data through the motion analysis
software, we noted poor palpation of the pelvic bony landmarks of two
participants. These correspond to those with strange data below. This introduced
large errors in locating the hip joint centre, and then caused dislocation of femur
head (our modelling does not constrain the joints to a fixed centre of rotation),
which influenced the result significantly. Therefore, we discarded the data of these
two participants.
The peak values mentioned in the manuscript are calculated as the mean values of
20%~35% and 70%~85% of the stance phase, at the same timing as the peak
KMFs. Therefore, this mean value is lower than the maximum peak. We have added
a clearer explanation in Section 3.4:
“The peak GRFs were defined as those at the same timing as the peak KMFs.
Specifically, these were calculated as the mean values across 20%-35% and 70%-
85% of the stance phase.”

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have taken on the reviewers comments and made significant changes
to the manuscript, which is now easier to understand and the conclusions are
within scope of the actual findings. I have only a few minor comments:
1. The description of the normalized force-endurance relationship formula (in
response to point 7 of my initial review) was a useful addition for me to understand
where this relationship came from. I would suggest including this in the appendix.
Response:
Dear reviewer, we have added this part to the Appendix.
“Appendix
The normalized force-endurance relationship formula is

where T is the endurance time, c is a constant, f is the muscle force, fmax is the

2. Page 2 line 50. The authors refer to KAM here as the "knee abduction moment",
when I believe it should be the knee ADDUCTION moment (externally applied).
Dear reviewer, we are really sorry to make such a mistake. It should be “knee
adduction moment”. We have corrected this in the manuscript.
Appendix C
Dear Editor and Reviewers,
Thank you for your patience. We reply all your comments on a point by point basis
below.

Authors
Reviewer comments to Author:
• It seems the gait test had a systematic problem (Table 5). Normally for
healthy subjects the first peak of GRF should be larger than the body weight due
to accelerations. When walking is not normal, smaller peak can happen, but the
walking would be purposely controlled (limping). Or, to GRF peak 1 less than
bodyweight they must be having a very short single support with a long double
support which basically means the other limb is taking more of the bodyweight.
I noticed the following explanation of the authors “The peak values mentioned in
the manuscript are calculated as the mean values of 20%~35% and 70%~85% of
the stance phase, at the same timing as the peak KMFs. Therefore, this mean value
is lower than the maximum peak. We have added a clearer explanation in Section
3.4:“The peak GRFs were defined as those at the same timing as the peak KMFs.
Specifically, these were calculated as the mean values across 20%-35% and 70%-
85% of the stance phase.”
However, the mean curve showed clearly the peak 1 is higher than a body weight,
then GRFy value could not be less than a body mass as they were listed in the table
if the peak1 was calculated as the mean of each peak 1of each individual trial
unless very bad trials were included in the calculation but not in the mean curve.
The mean curves of GRF look quite normal and typical. Only the peak 1 needs to
be checked.
Response:
Dear reviewer, we apologise that we were not clear enough. In order to make
accordance to the calculation of peak KMF, we used the mean values of GRF
during 20%~35% and 70%~85% of the stance phase for one trial as the first and
second peaks of this trial. For example, here is a GRFy figure of one trial. The
stars ‘*’ indicate the actual peaks of GRFy. However, we use the mean value of
each red part as the peak of GRFy in our paper: the mean of the red part is smaller
than the star. Therefore, the peak values listed in Table 5 is certainly smaller than
the actual peaks, and there are possibilities that the calculated peak 1 is smaller
than the body weight.
Reviewer comments to Author:
• The paper didn’t report the computation method in detail, such as marker
placement and software design, software validation. It is hard for readers to build
up their confidence in the results they presented. For example, during normal
walking the knee joint force (resultant force) at peak one would not be as high as
1.51 times of body weight and 2.32 times of body weight for medial side of the
knee only. I strongly recommend the authors validate their calculation results with
other commercial software such as OPEN SIMM or VIUSAL3D (C-Motion, USA)
on normal condition and then perform the other calculations.
Response:
Dear reviewer and editor,
We have conducted a lot of work to validate the model, and we have explained the
validation of the model in 2.2 Modelling:
“The validation of this original model has been described previously (1-5) through
comparison between the model calculations and in-vivo measurements of joint
reaction forces or EMG. The revised model with NMES has been validated (5)
through the measurement of gluteus maximus activation using EMG pre and post
application of NMES on loBF; the kinematics and kinetics input to the model were
measured simultaneously with the EMG, and strong positive correlations were
found in early stance peak (R=0.78, p=0.002) and impulse (R=0.63, p=0.021).”
Reviewer comments to Author:
• Normally KAM is directly proportional to GRFy, a higher GRF peak would
produce a higher Kam. The results from this paper showed different results GRFy
Peak1=0.97, Peak2=1.08, resulted in the peak 1 and 2 of KAM as 2.07±0.24
1.85±0.60, which were difficult to comprehend. The model and calculation
method should be checked.
Response:
Dear reviewer, we have checked the model in detail and confirm that the KAM
calculated through inverse dynamics can be affected by many factors, such as the
GRF, muscle force distribution, the location of knee centre, and so on. It is difficult
to estimate KAM by GRFy only and that is why musculoskeletal modelling is
required here.
Reviewer comments to Author:
