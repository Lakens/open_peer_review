The significance of the research question(s)
The paper is about framing of the well-studied Ultimatum Game. It is unclear to me what the
authors consider to be the significant novelty of their contribution. They argue against a
“mainstream view” of decision making in economic games, but their argument follows a long
tradition of criticism of decision makers as optimizers. They cite some of this literature but maybe
not enough. A particularly relevant theoretical paper is:
Weber, J. M., Kopelman, S., & Messick, D.M. (2004). A conceptual review of decision making in
social dilemmas: Applying a logic of appropriateness. Personality and Social Psychology Review,
8(3), 281–307.
The specific idea that people may spontaneously come up with different framings of an abstract
game is empirically explored in a recent paper of mine:
Kimmo Eriksson & Pontus Strimling (2014). Spontaneous associations and label framing have
similar effects in the public goods game. Judgment and Decision Making, 9, 360-372.
(I also have a very recent paper on framing the UG responder’s option as reduction instead of
rejection. The authors may be interested in the effects this framing was found to have. See Kimmo
Eriksson, Pontus Strimling, Per Andersson & Torun Lindholm (2017). Costly Punishment in the
Ultimatum Game Evokes Moral Concern, in Particular when Framed as Payoff Reduction.
Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 69, 59-64.)
From a theoretical point of view, I thought the most significant hypothesis was that variance in
decisions should decrease when an explicit frame is supplied (and I thought this should be
developed somewhat more in the introduction). Unfortunately, as I describe below, I do not think
the experiment is appropriate for testing this hypothesis.
The most significant idea of the paper, in this reviewer’s opinion, is to frame the UG proposer
both as a customer and as a banker. As offers in standard UG are seldom above 50%, it would be
a remarkable framing effect to have offers rise to close to 100%, as the authors expect will happen.
This should be highlighted in the introduction.
The logic, rationale, and plausibility of the proposed hypotheses
Two hypotheses are offered up in this paper: (1) mean offers and acceptance thresholds in a UG
that is explicitly framed as a transaction within a familiar economic institution will closely
conform to societal norms for that institution, and (2) variation of offers in the explicitly framed
game will be substantially less than variation of offers in the standard, unframed game.
I believe in both these hypotheses and I think they are well worth testing. However, as I describe
below, the experiment does not seem well-designed to test them.
The soundness and feasibility of the methodology and analysis pipeline (including statistical
power analysis where applicable)
The method is an experiment in which Mturk participants play a UG, either as a proposer or as a
responder, and either in the standard (abstract) framing or in the novel currency exchange
framing.
The reason this method is not sufficient to test Hyp 1 is that there is no measure of the “societal
norms for the institution”. A specific prediction of bank fees less than 15% is made, but his
prediction seemed to lack motivation, as it seemed unrelated to the preceding real-life examples
of bank fees. To properly test Hypothesis 1 I think you need a separate data collection from
another sample of the same population (i.e., Mturk) where you measure the societal norm by
3
asking just the simple question “Which bank fee (in percent) is fair in currency exchange?” or
similar. You would then obtain a measure with which to compare the mean for the participants in
the experiment.
The reason the experiment is not sufficient to test Hyp 2 is that your framing is expected to
change not only the variance but also the mean (this is Hyp 1). If a group has a mean value near
the floor or ceiling, then the variance is small by mathematical necessity. The variance hypothesis
can therefore only be tested using a framing that does NOT change the mean value but only the
variance.
Whether the clarity and degree of methodological detail would be sufficient to replicate exactly
the proposed experimental procedures and analysis pipeline
Yes, as far as I could see.
Whether the authors provide a sufficiently clear and detailed description of the methods to
prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedures or analysis pipeline
Yes, as far as I could see.
Whether the authors have considered sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. positive
controls) for ensuring that the results obtained are able to test the stated hypotheses
My concerns are outlined above.

label_comment_2
This is an interesting and well-written protocol to run a study manipulating the “context frame”
on the classic Ultimatum Game. The literature review summarizes the background from
anthropological studies, showing that in cultures where the UG is framed in reference to a
particular economic tradition, UG behaviour is substantially shifted; the authors explain how this
has substantial implications for interpretation of standard UG data collected in the laboratory.
This is a worthwhile experiment and appropriate for the journal.
From their rationale, I was expecting the authors to develop two contextual frames to try to pull
UG behaviour in both directions in Western culture as a function of different contexts. They do
propose two conditions within the banking context, in which participants either play as the
4
banker or the customer, but in both cases, my understanding of their prediction is that UG
behaviour will approximate 15:85 rather than 60:40. Shifting behaviour in both directions relative
to the standard scenario, within the same experiment, would provide more convincing evidence
for their hypothesis. As the authors go so far as suggesting a means of doing this (a windfall
between friends should be divided equally), some clarification would be helpful as to why the
authors do not include this condition in their design. Presumably the predicted shift would be
smaller for such a frame, and this will complicate their elaborate power calculation.
In the transition from the rationale to the experimental design, there are a few points that should
be clarified. The rationale does not adequately distinguish proposer from responder behaviour.
My interpretation was that their context predictions pertain mainly to UG proposals. On pg 14
the authors establish a sample size of 60 per condition, and immediately say that 120 will be
tested. This section needs to refer to proposers and responders. Second, as this is an MTurk study,
are the responder – proposer pairings (stated in the instructions) real or artificial? (If real, how is
this achieved? If artificial, are the responder group actually necessary for the logic of the
hypotheses?
Third, I was confused about the number of UG trials per participant. From the methods, they
appear to be using a single-shot game. As the introduction discusses the role of learning in UG
strategy, this final section of the introduction should be explicit about justifying their use of the
single-shot game. In the first power calculation on pg 13, I initially misread their calculation of
“only n=10 offers per condition” to mean 10 trials in a multi-shot game per participant.
Other than these points of clarification, the experiment is feasible and described in sufficient
detail, with clear separation of a priori and exploratory analyses. The authors pay impressive
attention to the power calculation for deciding sample size, based on their hypotheses about both
the mean shift and the change in variability, and taking into account the variable levels of
expertise in their participants which will likely affect the observed distributions. The MTurk
materials are provided in the appendix, to avoid undisclosed flexibility in the procedure.

Comments to the Author:
Two expert reviewers have now considered the submission. Both reviews highlight points of
merit but also identify need for significant revisions. Reviewer 1 (Kimmo Eriksson) queries
several aspects of the study rationale and principal hypotheses while also noting methodological
limitations in the ability of the proposed methods to apply a strong test of key predictions.
Reviewer 2 is more positive but also raises concerns about the rationale and areas requiring
greater methodological clarification. All concerns will need to be fully addressed for the
submission to proceed to IPA.

I was happy to see that the authors have collected pilot data allowing them to fine-tune their final
study. The data from the pilot study are promising for their interesting hypothesis of a radical
framing effect. I agree with the authors's decision to remove the secondary hypothesis.
I have some minor concerns I would like the authors to address:
1. With respect to some references I suggested the authors responded
"These papers are indeed relevant to our study, and we now include them in our
table of framing studies (Table 1)." However, they are not yet included in that table, nor in the
reference list. I think Larrick and Blount's framing of the UG should also be included in this table.
2. I do not understand exactly what Fig 2 shows, and the main text does not tell me what to take
home from it. I suggest removing this figure if it does not have an important message.
3. After the figures 1-3, the following paragraph comes: "Based on this, we modified our protocol
to include more detailed vignettes in the treatment conditions relating to currency exchange. We
isolated our predictions about variation in a treatment condition of its own (the windfall
condition). No predictions were made about the central tendency of offers in the windfall
condition, and it will be similarly subject to a more detailed vignette approach. Overall, our
modified protocol should allow us to replicate the general findings in this pilot study, but with
more detailed frames to further reduce ambiguity about the UG".
That paragraph is really confusing and must be rewritten. First, exactly how was the protocol
changed between the pilot and the main study? Second, what does it mean to "isolate
predictions"? Third, what does it mean to subject a prediction to "a more detailed vignette
approach"?

Appendix A
We thank the associate editor and the 2 reviewers for their numerous helpful
comments and suggestions, which greatly improved the manuscript. In
response to reviewer comments, we conducted a pilot study based on our

document). Our main hypotheses were upheld, but there were also some
unexpected results. We therefore revised our study design (as we discuss below

Two expert reviewers have now considered the submission. Both reviews
highlight points of merit but also identify need for significant revisions.
Reviewer 1 (Kimmo Eriksson) queries several aspects of the study rationale
and principal hypotheses while also noting methodological limitations in
the ability of the proposed methods to apply a strong test of key
predictions. Reviewer 2 is more positive but also raises concerns about the
rationale and areas requiring greater methodological clarification. All
concerns will need to be fully addressed for the submission to proceed to
IPA.

The significance of the research question(s)
The paper is about framing of the well-studied Ultimatum Game. It is
unclear to me what the authors consider to be the significant novelty of
their contribution.
We predicted two extremely novel patterns: (1) that in one condition, the
proposers would make much smaller offers than in the standard UG, i.e.,
approximately 10%, and that many of these offers would be accepted by the
responders, and (2) that in another condition, proposers would make much
larger offers than in the standard UG, i.e., approximately 90%, and that many
high offers (i.e., those >50%) would be rejected. As the reviewer himself notes
below, “As offers in standard UG are seldom above 50%, it would be a
1
remarkable framing effect to have offers rise to close to 100%, as the authors
expect will happen.”
We now have pilot data, and the mean offer in condition 1 (customer as
proposer) was 18% with strong modes at 0, 5 and 10%, and in condition 2
(banker as proposer) the mean offer was 69% with modes at 100, 95, 90 and
50%. Both results differ substantially from the mean offer of the control
condition, which was 44% with strong modes at 40 and 50% (control-customer
Cohen’s D = 1.24, control-banker Cohen’s D = -0.95). Later we discuss our
proposed modifications to the research protocol to improve on these results.
They argue against a “mainstream view” of decision making in economic
games, but their argument follows a long tradition of criticism of decision
makers as optimizers. They cite some of this literature but maybe not
enough. A particularly relevant theoretical paper is:
Weber, J. M., Kopelman, S., & Messick, D.M. (2004). A conceptual review of
decision making in social dilemmas: Applying a logic of appropriateness.
Personality and Social Psychology Review, 8(3), 281–307.
We agree that there is a long tradition of criticism of the view that decision
makers are optimizers. In fact, the standard UG result (e.g., a 40-60 split) is the
empirical foundation for many of these criticisms. Our aim was to further explore
one particular line of criticism, that which invokes framing effects, or as we now
note in our introduction, a “logic of appropriateness.” Our innovation is to supply
study participants with a rich set of cues regarding a familiar frame (currency
exchange), with relatively clear standards for offers (e.g., 10% or 90%). This is
unlike previous framing studies which provided only minimal cues, and which
did not involve frames with relatively clear social norms for offers differing
substantially from 50%. We hope we have clarified these issues in our revisions.
The specific idea that people may spontaneously come up with different
framings of an abstract game is empirically explored in a recent paper of
mine:
Kimmo Eriksson & Pontus Strimling (2014). Spontaneous associations and
label framing have similar effects in the public goods game. Judgment and
Decision Making, 9, 360-372.
(I also have a very recent paper on framing the UG responder’s option as
reduction instead of rejection. The authors may be interested in the effects
this framing was found to have. See Kimmo Eriksson, Pontus Strimling, Per
Andersson & Torun Lindholm (2017). Costly Punishment in the Ultimatum
Game Evokes Moral Concern, in Particular when Framed as Payoff
Reduction. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 69, 59-64.)
These papers are indeed relevant to our study, and we now include them in our
table of framing studies (Table 1). We expect that these recent papers will also
2
provide interesting discussion points when considering the similarities and
differences between frame content in our studies and previous studies (such as
the 2014 paper), and underlying reasons for the predicted shifts in responder
behavior (possibly in contrast to those discussed in the 2017 paper) after
presenting our results.
From a theoretical point of view, I thought the most significant hypothesis
was that variance in decisions should decrease when an explicit frame is
supplied (and I thought this should be developed somewhat more in the
introduction). Unfortunately, as I describe below, I do not think the
experiment is appropriate for testing this hypothesis.
We respond to this comment below.
The most significant idea of the paper, in this reviewer’s opinion, is to
frame the UG proposer both as a customer and as a banker. As offers in
standard UG are seldom above 50%, it would be a remarkable framing
effect to have offers rise to close to 100%, as the authors expect will
happen. This should be highlighted in the introduction.
We now highlight this prediction in our introduction. Our pilot data mostly
supported our original prediction, and we now predict that our revised protocol
will improve on our pilot data, i.e., a greater fraction of offers will be above 90%
or below 10%, depending on condition (we now also have pilot survey data for
“fair” offers in the banker vs. customer conditions; see below).
Note that we also predicted that in the customer-first condition, responders will
frequently accept very low offers, and in the banker-first condition will reject
some offers above 50%, contrary to acceptance patterns in the standard UG,
and our pilot data also supported this prediction.
The logic, rationale, and plausibility of the proposed hypotheses
Two hypotheses are offered up in this paper: (1) mean offers and
acceptance thresholds in a UG that is explicitly framed as a transaction
within a familiar economic institution will closely conform to societal norms
for that institution, and (2) variation of offers in the explicitly framed game
will be substantially less than variation of offers in the standard, unframed
game.
I believe in both these hypotheses and I think they are well worth testing.
However, as I describe below, the experiment does not seem
well-designed to test them.
The soundness and feasibility of the methodology and analysis pipeline
3
(including statistical power analysis where applicable)
The method is an experiment in which Mturk participants play a UG, either
as a proposer or as a responder, and either in the standard (abstract)
framing or in the novel currency exchange framing.
The reason this method is not sufficient to test Hyp 1 is that there is no
measure of the “societal norms for the institution”. A specific prediction of
bank fees less than 15% is made, but his prediction seemed to lack
motivation, as it seemed unrelated to the preceding real-life examples of
bank fees. To properly test Hypothesis 1 I think you need a separate data
collection from another sample of the same population (i.e., Mturk) where
you measure the societal norm by asking just the simple question “Which
bank fee (in percent) is fair in currency exchange?” or similar. You would
then obtain a measure with which to compare the mean for the participants
in the experiment.
We took the reviewer’s suggestion when collecting our pilot data. After
participants played the UG, we asked, “What do you consider to be a fair bank
fee in a real world currency exchange scenario?” The results from our pilot study
were: mean = 8.4%, sd = 15.0%.
The reason the experiment is not sufficient to test Hyp 2 is that your
framing is expected to change not only the variance but also the mean (this
is Hyp 1). If a group has a mean value near the floor or ceiling, then the
variance is small by mathematical necessity. The variance hypothesis can
therefore only be tested using a framing that does NOT change the mean
value but only the variance.
Good point. Furthermore, our pilot data refuted this hypothesis, as the variance
in the treatment conditions was significantly greater than in the control
condition. We now omit this prediction for the customer and banker conditions.
However, we now include a new “windfall” condition, in which players are
framed as “friends”, and the stake is framed as a “windfall”. We predict that the
variance in the “windfall” condition will be less than the variance in the standard
unframed UG.
Whether the clarity and degree of methodological detail would be sufficient
to replicate exactly the proposed experimental procedures and analysis
pipeline
Yes, as far as I could see.
4
Whether the authors provide a sufficiently clear and detailed description of
the methods to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental
procedures or analysis pipeline
Yes, as far as I could see.
Whether the authors have considered sufficient outcome-neutral
conditions (e.g. positive controls) for ensuring that the results obtained are
able to test the stated hypotheses
My concerns are outlined above.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting and well-written protocol to run a study manipulating
the “context frame” on the classic Ultimatum Game. The literature review
summarizes the background from anthropological studies, showing that in
cultures where the UG is framed in reference to a particular economic
tradition, UG behaviour is substantially shifted; the authors explain how this
has substantial implications for interpretation of standard UG data
collected in the laboratory. This is a worthwhile experiment and
appropriate for the journal.
From their rationale, I was expecting the authors to develop two contextual
frames to try to pull UG behaviour in both directions in Western culture as a
function of different contexts. They do propose two conditions within the
banking context, in which participants either play as the banker or the
customer, but in both cases, my understanding of their prediction is that
UG behaviour will approximate 15:85 rather than 60:40. Shifting behaviour
in both directions relative to the standard scenario, within the same
experiment, would provide more convincing evidence for their hypothesis.
We do, in effect, exactly this with our study design by switching the banker and
customer labels between conditions. In one condition, the proposer will be
labeled “customer” and here we predict a 15:85 split. In the second condition,
the proposer will be the banker, and we predict an 85:15 split.
We suggest that this is one of the more novel predictions of this study, and
revised parts of the study aims (introduction) to clarify this point.
As our pilot data make clear, we did indeed have low mean offers in the
5
customer first condition (mean = 18%, Cohen’s D = 1.24) and high mean offers
in the banker first condition (mean = 69%, Cohen’s D = -0.95), relative to our
standard UG control (mean = 44%). These differences were all highly significant
(p << .001). We have revised our study design in ways that we predict will more
closely achieve a 15:85 and 85:15 split, or better.
As the authors go so far as suggesting a means of doing this (a windfall
between friends should be divided equally), some clarification would be
helpful as to why the authors do not include this condition in their design.
Presumably the predicted shift would be smaller for such a frame, and this
will complicate their elaborate power calculation.
Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we now do include a “windfall” condition to
compare to the unframed condition. We do not predict a shift in the mean, but
do predict significantly lower offer variance in the windfall condition compared
to the control condition.
In the transition from the rationale to the experimental design, there are a
few points that should be clarified. The rationale does not adequately
distinguish proposer from responder behaviour. My interpretation was that
their context predictions pertain mainly to UG proposals.
Our design and predictions apply to both proposers and responders. We hope
that this distinction has been addressed in our revisions in the study aims, which
now outlines our predictions about responder behavior as well. Specifically, the
key result that we predict is relevant to proposer behavior (i.e., that
customers/proposers will give amounts equal to 0% + a small bank fee, and
bankers/proposers will give amounts equal 100% minus a small bank fee), but
we also predict that bankers/responders will commonly accept offers near 0% +
small fair bank fee, and customers/responders will commonly reject offers that
are greater than 50% but less than 100% minus a fair bank fee.
These predictions received some support in our pilot data. In our control
condition, no offers of 50% or greater were rejected and 43.5% of offers less
than 40% were rejected. Of the accepted offers in the control, 74.4% were
between 40 and 50%, and 9.3% were under 25%. These results are similar to
other studies.
In contrast, in the customer condition, 81% of the accepted offers were under
40%, 66% were under 25%, and only 27.4% were between 40 and 50%. In the
banker condition, 45% of the offers above 50% were rejected, and most offers
(82.1%) were higher than 50%.
We have revised our study design in ways that will hopefully sharpen these
results.

On pg 14 the authors establish a sample size of 60 per condition, and
immediately say that 120 will be tested. This section needs to refer to
proposers and responders.
Revisions were made in this section to clarify this: sample size refers to the
number of offers (thus, number of games), so a sample size = 60 means 60
proposer-responder <U+200B>pairs<U+200B> per condition (i.e., 120 participants per condition).
Second, as this is an MTurk study, are the responder – proposer pairings
(stated in the instructions) real or artificial? (If real, how is this achieved? If
artificial, are the responder group actually necessary for the logic of the
hypotheses?
The pairings for the UG will be real, which we hope has now been clarified in the
methods with our revisions (under “Sample”). We will achieve this by using
oTree<U+200B>, an open source software platform for implementing live experimental
economic games on Amazon Mturk (http://www.otree.org).
There is no deception in our study design.
Third, I was confused about the number of UG trials per participant. From
the methods, they appear to be using a single-shot game.
Yes. We now clarify this.
As the introduction discusses the role of learning in UG strategy, this final
section of the introduction should be explicit about justifying their use of
the single-shot game.
Good point. We now clarify that because we are framing the UG as a familiar
economic institution (currency exchange), participants will already have learned
the relevant “fair” offers in real life, and we do not expect them to learn these in
the game itself (in some ways, that is the main hypothesis of our study).
In the first power calculation on pg 13, I initially misread their calculation of
“only n=10 offers per condition” to mean 10 trials in a multi-shot game per
participant.
In the power analysis section, we now clarify that sample size refers to the
number of single-shot games with different pairs of participants, rather than
number of trials with the same pairs of participants.
The introductory comments about learning during the UG point to the underlying
rationale for why people are expected to use a narrower set of behaviors in
7
games framed as familiar situations: in the framed instances, they have already
learned the Nash equilibrium for the game while “out in the real world.” This is in
contrast to the several rounds of game play that <U+200B>would be required<U+200B> had it been a
novel scenario, which the standard unframed UG is.
Other than these points of clarification, the experiment is feasible and
described in sufficient detail, with clear separation of a priori and
exploratory analyses. The authors pay impressive attention to the power
calculation for deciding sample size, based on their hypotheses about both
the mean shift and the change in variability, and taking into account the
variable levels of expertise in their participants which will likely affect the
observed distributions.
Note that our new power analyses are based on bootstrapping our empirical
pilot data rather than on Monte Carlo simulations from mixtures of parametric
distributions.
Contrary to our original hypothesis, self-reported real-world experience with
currency exchange and international travel was not associated with the size or
variation of offers in our pilot study. We therefore now omit this prediction.
The MTurk materials are provided in the appendix, to avoid undisclosed
flexibility in the procedure.

Comments to the Author(s)
I was happy to see that the authors have collected pilot data allowing them
to fine-tune their final study. The data from the pilot study are promising for
their interesting hypothesis of a radical framing effect. I agree with the
authors's decision to remove the secondary hypothesis.
I have some minor concerns I would like the authors to address:
1. With respect to some references I suggested the authors responded
"These papers are indeed relevant to our study, and we now include them
in our table of framing studies (Table 1)." However, they are not yet
included in that table, nor in the reference list. I think Larrick and Blount's
framing of the UG should also be included in this table.
The recommended papers, which helped expand our literature search, were:

decision making in social dilemmas: Applying a logic of appropriateness.

Costly Punishment in the Ultimatum Game Evokes Moral Concern, in
Particular when Framed as Payoff Reduction. Journal of Experimental Social
Psychology, 69, 59-64.)
We included the theoretical paper (Weber et al. 2004) in our introduction text,
and now include data from both Eriksson and Strimling (2014) and Larrick and
Blount (1997) in Table 1.
2. I do not understand exactly what Fig 2 shows, and the main text does not
tell me what to take home from it. I suggest removing this figure if it does
not have an important message.
We have omitted Figure 2 as recommended.
3. After the figures 1-3, the following paragraph comes: "Based on this, we
modified our protocol to include more detailed vignettes in the treatment
conditions relating to currency exchange. We isolated our predictions
about variation in a treatment condition of its own (the windfall condition).
No predictions were made about the central tendency of offers in the
windfall condition, and it will be similarly subject to a more detailed
vignette approach. Overall, our modified protocol should allow us to
replicate the general findings in this pilot study, but with more detailed
frames to further reduce ambiguity about the UG".
That paragraph is really confusing and must be rewritten.
This paragraph was rewritten to more clearly address the three questions
outlined (below).
First, exactly how was the protocol changed between the pilot and the main
study?
The key changes in our protocol were: (1) originally, participants in the treatment
conditions first read the same brief vignette, and were then assigned to customer
or banker roles. Now, participants in the treatment conditions are first assigned to
customer or bankers roles, and then read more detailed vignettes written,
respectively from either a customer or banker point of view. (2) We added a
windfall condition to test the reduced variance hypothesis (which also uses a
vignette written from the participant’s perspective).
Second, what does it mean to "isolate predictions"?
This was poorly worded. After abandoning the variance predictions in our
customer/banker conditions, we added the windfall condition to test this
decreased variance prediction in its own (isolated) condition. We changed this
wording, however, to explain that more clearly.
Third, what does it mean to subject a prediction to "a more detailed
vignette approach"?
This is in reference to our change of instructional format, described above, and
was rewritten for clarity.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have considered the reviewer feedback carefully, running a
pilot study to refine their hypotheses, obtaining data on a reasonable bank
fees to establish the relevant cultural norm, and adding a further 'windfall'
condition. The revised design is suitable for the authors to proceed now to
run the full experiment.
