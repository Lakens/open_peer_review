Microwave heating technology has strong potential to be successful in this field of metallurgy as
it was confirmed by previous studies. More literature research and background investigation are
recommended to help readers get more comprehensive understanding of the method, including
the introduction of thermometallurgy and comparison with alternative methods. For example,
(1)Guo Chen et al. Effects of microwave heating on microstructures and structure properties of
the manganese ore, Journal of Alloys and Compounds, 2016, 657: 515-518,
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.10.147;
(2)Fangfang Wu et al. Phase transformation of iron in limonite ore by microwave roasting with
addition of alkali lignin and its effects on magnetic separation, Journal of Alloys and
Compounds, 2017, 722: 651-661, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.06.142. Experimental
methods of microwave roasting as well as characterization methods of the above literatures are
also recommended to clarify the advantages of microwave heating in the reduction process.
This article is well structured although several mistakes of the presentation should be noticed, for
example, “aims” should be replaced by “aim” in line 2 of abstract, “remove” should be changed
to “removal” in line 18 page 10, “are” should be deleted in line 34 page 11, etc.
In Fig. 3A, mass slightly increased below 1200°C,please explain the phenomenon.
In Part 5.2, permittivities at different frequencies were measured, when temperature exceeds
900°C,<U+025B>" shows a more rapid rise at 1064MHz than at 2423MHz, please explain why.
What’s the relationship between the reduction rate and the dielectric property of ZnO and
ZnFe2O4? The relationship between these two main parts of the study need to be illustrated in
combination with the experimental results. In the discussion and conclusion part, they were
discussed separately and no clear relevance mentioned, graphite seems to play a more important
role in the reduction according to the manuscript.

This manuscript deals with the carbothermic reduction of zinc oxide and zinc ferrite by
microwave heating. And some interesting results have been achieved. It could be considered for
the publication in Royal Society Open Science after addressing the following issues:
1. The author should explain why choose graphene as the reducing agent other than other carbon
materials?
2. The figure titles are not properly described from Fig. 3 - Fig. 5.
3. Page 7, line58, the sentence that “TG curve show that mass loss about 90% due to the complete
evaporation” is inappropriate. The mass loss contain the loss of graphene.
4. Page 8, line 10 and line 57, the author should give the evidence that the final product is CO
other than CO2.

Appendix A
Dear Dr. Siobhán Hackett,
I am pleased to resubmit for publication the revised version of RSOS-170710 “Dielectric properties and
carbothermic reduction of zinc oxide and zinc ferrite by microwave heating“. I appreciated the
constructive comments of the reviewer. I have addressed each of their comments as outlined below.
Changes are highlighted in the text by using red color
Reviewer: 1
- Comments to the Author(s)
Microwave heating technology has strong potential to be successful in this field of metallurgy as it was
confirmed by previous studies. More literature research and background investigation are recommended
to help readers get more comprehensive understanding of the method, including the introduction of
thermometallurgy and comparison with alternative methods. For example,
(1)Guo Chen et al. Effects of microwave heating on microstructures and structure properties of the
manganese ore, Journal of Alloys and Compounds, 2016, 657: 515-518.
(2)Fangfang Wu et al. Phase transformation of iron in limonite ore by microwave roasting with addition
of alkali lignin and its effects on magnetic separation, Journal of Alloys and Compounds, 2017, 722: 651-
661.
The reviewer suggest adding more literature to the introduction part about advantages of microwave
heating, comparison microwave with conventional method and application of microwave in the roasting
and reduction process. The literature has been added to introduction part.
- This article is well structured although several mistakes of the presentation should be noticed, for
example, “aims” should be replaced by “aim” in line 2 of abstract, “remove” should be changed to
“removal” in line 18 page 10, “are” should be deleted in line 34 page 11, etc.
These mistakes have been corrected
- In Fig. 3A, mass slightly increased below 1200°C,please explain the phenomenon.
There is a slight gradual weight gain < 0.5 % below 1200 °C. DSC curve did not confirm any thermal
reaction in the temperature below 1200 °C. This may be due to that as the energy within the sample
increases by heating it up, this may lead to slight increase in mass. Theoretical, the kinetic energy of the
individual atoms would make a contribution to the mass.
- In Part 5.2, permittivities at different frequencies were measured, when temperature exceeds 900°C,
<U+025B>" shows a more rapid rise at 1064MHz than at 2423MHz, please explain why.
With regards to the dielectric loss factor (<U+025B>"), it was found that it is slightly increasing with the decrease
of frequency. This result is attributed to the penetration depth of electromagnetic energy at frequency
1064 MHz is greater than that at microwave frequency 2423 MHz.
- What’s the relationship between the reduction rate and the dielectric property of ZnO and ZnFe2O4?
The relationship between these two main parts of the study need to be illustrated in combination with
the experimental results.
In this work, the dielectric properties were measured for the raw sample and the effect of temperature
on the real and imaginary permittivities of zinc oxide, and zinc ferrite at 2423 and 1064 MHz frequencies
were measured. The dielectric properties of the raw samples were compared with the results from
thermal analysis (DSC-TG) of raw samples, and listed in part 5.2. The results indicated that the
dielectric values for both samples were quite low, therefore both zinc oxide and zinc ferrite are poor
microwave absorbers. Based on these results, graphite was used a reducing agent and absorbent of
microwave energy to improve the heating rate of both samples.

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript deals with the carbothermic reduction of zinc oxide and zinc ferrite by microwave
heating. And some interesting results have been achieved. It could be considered for the publication in
Royal Society Open Science after addressing the following issues:
1. The author should explain why choose graphene as the reducing agent other than other carbon
materials?
In this study graphite was used as a reducing agent and absorbent of microwave energy. From the
previous work, researchers indicated that graphite absorbs microwave energy very well and better than
other carbon source like, coke and lignite.
2. The figure titles are not properly described from Fig. 3 - Fig. 5.
The figures Fig. 3 – Fig. 5 titles are properly described, in addition the titles have been improved.
3. Page 7, line58, the sentence that “TG curve show that mass loss about 90% due to the complete
evaporation” is inappropriate. The mass loss contain the loss of graphene.
The mass loss is due to the evaporation of zinc, and graphite gasification (that causes the formation of
the CO/CO2 atmosphere). This sentence has been modified in the text.
4. Page 8, line 10 and line 57, the author should give the evidence that the final product is CO other
than CO2.
The required amount of carbon depends heavily on whether carbon is assumed to react into carbon
monoxide (CO) or carbon dioxide (CO2). The stoichiometric amount of carbon required to completely
reduce zinc oxide (ZnO) into elemental zinc was calculated based on reduction reactions presented in
equations (4), in part 4.3.
ZnO + C = Zn + CO (C reacts into CO)
More clarification has been added to this part. (5.1)
