The authors developed a LC-MS assay for the determination of Spebrutinib in human liver
microsomes. This method is properly developed and having enough scientific merits to publish.
But Authors should have been taken more care in manuscript preparation and data presentation.
Many formatting errors in this manuscript. I request Authors to revise the manuscript as per the
comments below:
1. Delete the word "Accurately" in title. Also, LC-MS should be LC-MS/MS. Avoid abbreviations
in Abstract. Provide list all abbreviations used. Abbreviate for the first time and used
abbreviation thereafter (example Internal standard, IS; Page 4 lane 21-22; in Table 1).
2. In abstract Lane 15: it should be 5-500 ng/mL.
3. Please cite all figures and tables in the text. Avoid jumping of the sentence Example:
Introduction Page 3 Lane 32-33. Authors explained about the available literature. In next lanes
again explained about the drug profile. The order should be explained about the drug profile, PK,
PD etc, followed by literature review and highlights of the proposed method or details of the
proposed method.
4. Section 2.2, please modify as “Instrumentation and conditions”. This section should explain
only about the optimized chromatographic and mass spectrometric conditions of the proposed
method. Please delete details about how the IS was selected. This should be explained in the
results and discussion section. Also, the details provided in Page 4, Lane 38-54, is almost like
details in Table 1. Its duplication of the data. Hence, request to provide all LC-MS/MS conditions
in text or Table, either one.
5. Provide Scheme 1 as Supplementary Data or with Figure 2.
6. Section 2.3 change to “preparation of Stock Solutions and Working Solutions”. Section 2.4
“Preparation of Calibration standards and Quality Controls”. Replace ACN with acetonitrile in
entire manuscript. Page 6, Lane 32-38 “A calibration graph…” delete, not necessary, its
duplication.
7. It was not clear when the IS was added to samples. As per the Lane 21-22 of Page 6, the IS was
added to the samples after processing. In Bioanalysis, the use of Internal standard is to avoid the
sample processing and chromatography related errors (others too). But in the present method the
IS was added after the sample precipitation, means after complete extraction of analytes, where
there is a scope of extraction errors or possible loss. Reason?
8. Page 6, lane 51-53; Assay recovery…Please delete sentence. This section should explain only
about how the validation was carried out and not the results.
9. Results and discussion: Explain how mass spectrometry conditions were optimized,
Chromatography, Extraction conditions optimization and reason for selecting NQT as IS.
10. As part of Bioanalytical method validation, analyte stability in matrix (at room temperature,
Freeze & thaw, and upon long-term storage etc) as well as in neat sample (eg stock solution
stability) and processed samples stability should be established.
11. What is the C18 column brand used.

1. Delete the word "Accurately" in title. Also, LC-MS should be LC-MS/MS. Avoid abbreviations in
Abstract. Provide list all abbreviations used. Abbreviate for the first time and used abbreviation
there after (example Internal standard, IS; Page 4 lane 21-22; in Table 1).
a- The title was corrected as requested to read: A highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method to

evaluation.
b- The list of abbreviations was provided.
c- The manuscript was revised and abbreviations were adjusted.
2. In abstract Lane 15: it should be 5-500 ng/mL.
We corrected this as requested.
3. Please cite all figures and tables in the text. Avoid jumping of the sentence Example: Introduction
Page 3 Lane 32-33. Authors explained about the available literature. In next lanes again
explained about the drug profile. The order should be explained about the drug profile, PK, PD
etc, followed by literature review and highlights of the proposed method or details of the proposed
method.
We rearranged the paragraph as requested and we cited all figures and tables.
4. Section 2.2, please modify as “Instrumentation and conditions”. This section should explain only
about the optimized chromatographic and mass spectrometric conditions of the proposed
method. Please delete details about how the IS was selected. This should be explained in the
results and discussion section. Also, the details provided in Page 4, Lane 38-54, is almost like
details in Table 1. Its duplication of the data. Hence, request to provide all LC-MS/MS conditions
in text or Table, either one.
a- The title of the section was modified as requested.
b- Table 1 was removed.
c- The section was revised and rearranged as requested.
5. Provide Scheme 1 as Supplementary Data or with Figure 2.
We moved scheme 1 to figure 2 as requested.
6. Section 2.3 change to “preparation of Stock Solutions and Working Solutions”. Section 2.4
“Preparation of Calibration standards and Quality Controls”. Replace ACN with acetonitrile in
entire manuscript. Page 6, Lane 32-38 “A calibration graph…” delete, not necessary, its
duplication.
We did as requested.
7. It was not clear when the IS was added to samples. As per the Lane 21-22 of Page 6, the IS was
added to the samples after processing. In Bioanalysis, the use of Internal standard is to avoid the
sample processing and chromatography related errors (others too). But in the present method the
IS was added after the sample precipitation, means after complete extraction of analytes, where
there is a scope of extraction errors or possible loss. Reason?
a- We added IS just before the addition of acetonitrile to avoid any effect of IS on the
metabolism of SBT. We clarified this in the updated manuscript to read:
IS working solution (100 µL) was added immediately before the addition of metabolic
quenching agent (acetonitrile) to avoid any effect on the rate of SBT metabolism.
Acetonitrile is used as a quenching agent for metabolic reaction and as precipitating
agent in protein precipitation extraction procedure.
b- We calculated the extraction recovery for IS as indicated in the text and we measured
the matrix effect on IS ionization
8. Page 6, lane 51-53; Assay recovery…Please delete sentence. This section should explain only
about how the validation was carried out and not the results.
We did as requested and rearranged this paragraph.
9. Results and discussion: Explain how mass spectrometry conditions were optimized,
Chromatography, Extraction conditions optimization and reason for selecting NQT as IS.
We rearranged the whole section including requested information.
10. As part of Bioanalytical method validation, analyte stability in matrix (at room temperature, Freeze
& thaw, and upon long-term storage etc) as well as in neat sample (eg stock solution stability)
and processed samples stability should be established.
These experiments were done before during validation but we thought it is not necessary
as HLMs is not a biological fluid as human plasma that can be taken from patient and
stored. HLMs mixed with phosphate buffer just before the experiment. We had the data
and we update the required details in the manuscript.
11. What is the C18 column brand used.
Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 column (length, 100 mm; internal diameter, 2.1 mm;
and particle size, 1.8 µm).
We updated this in the manuscript at section 2.2. Instrumentation and conditions
