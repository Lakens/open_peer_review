This paper is nicely written, carefully explained, and theoretically satisfying. The authors give a
unified treatment of models with the same symmetry as Huygens's famous observations on the
synchronization of two pendulum clocks that are coupled through the vibrations of a heavy beam
from which they are both supported. It has been a long-standing question to understand why
Huygens saw only anti-phase synchronization, but more recent experiments have seen in-phase
synchronization, or sometimes the coexistence of both in-phase and anti-phase synchronization.
Using the techniques of equivariant bifurcation theory, normal form analysis, and dynamical
systems for systems with symmetry, the authors are able to rationalize essentially all the results
observed in previous studies. This level of agreement comes as a bit of a surprise, given that the
authors' model for the escapement is qualitatively different from what Huygens used and what
several recent authors used in their experiments.
One suggestion is that it would be helpful to show a sketch of the various escapement
mechanisms discussed in the text, with words like ``pallet'' and ``scape wheel'' and ``teeth'' all
labeled. Otherwise, it will not be easy for readers unacquainted with these terms to visualize
3
them without a diagram, and no reader wants to have to search for such a diagram elsewhere
(e.g., in the book by Landes).

revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
5
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.

Huygens’ Clocks Revisited, RSOS-170777
r Editor:
would like to thank the reviewers for their comments and suggestions. We have modified
manuscript based on these in the following way.
. All minor typographical errors pointed out by the reviewers have been fixed.
. A figure (new Figure 2) has been added in Section 2 showing schematics of verge and
anchor escapement mechanisms as suggested by the first reviewer. Associated text has
also been added in that section.
. The third reviewer pointed out that one of the hypotheses of the Equivariant Hopf
Theorem (EHT) was not satisfied by our system. We thank the reviewer for noticing
this. Upon consultation with Martin Golubitsky and Ian Stewart we have determined
that although our system does not satisfy the Gamma-simple hypothesis, it does satisfy
a condition that is sufficient for the proof of that theorem, with modification, to be
valid. We have modified our text in Section 3 to reflect this.
. The third reviewer also questions why we need the EHT at all. We have added text in
Section 3 to explain why we use the EHT: it answers Huygens’ question as to why he
saw anti-phase symmetry.
. The third reviewer points out that we have used a normal form truncated to cubic
terms and have not considered the effect of higher order terms. That is correct. We
have added text in Section 4 to acknowledge this. However, we expect nearly all of
the solutions arising from secondary bifurcations that we discuss are structurally stable
and will persist when higher order terms are added, and have indicated so in the text.
As for the transition from the 4D to the 6D system, it is based on the Centre Manifold
Theorem. The centre manifold is normally hyperbolic by definition, and asymptotically
stable in our case. Therefore, trajectories off the centre manifold decay exponentially
to solutions on the centre manifold. Therefore, asymptotically, the 6D and 4D systems
have the same solutions.
. The third reviewer requested more clarification regarding what is new in this manuscript
compared to our previous paper. We have added text at the end of Section 1 to address
this issue. Other than the normal form itself, only the work presented in Section 5 (and
not even all of that) is also present in the previous paper. We have also added a sentence
in the first paragraph of Section 5 indicating which of that material comes from the
previous paper.
In addition to the above, we have also made changes to Section 5 in the discussion about
ather solutions. We have made clearer how the synchronized breather can escape the 2-
us and have added a new figure (new Figure 5) showing a period doubling cascade leading
rom a synchronized breather to a chaotic breather.
Finally, we have made a few minor edits for clarity and correctness.
The original sychronized breather video that was uploaded as supplementary material has
been uploaded to Dryad, along with a video of a chaotic breather solution.
