Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The authors investigate the existence of consistent between-individual differences (personality) in
biological rhythms in fish, a group often overlooked in studies of animal personality. Their
objectives were to quantify the repeatability of four behaviors related to individuals’ chronotype
(awakening time, rest onset, rest-duration, and daily activity) between individuals using repeated
measures, and to describe the covariance structure of these behaviors. The authors track 14 free-
living marked individuals during two years, and quantify behavioral phenotypes based on
acoustic tracking. Results demonstrate relatively high repeatability in all behaviors measured,
however there was no evidence for a sleep-related behavioral syndrome in these fish. I applaud
the authors for investigating personality and biological rhythms in a system that is difficult to
study. However, I have reservations about the foundation, motivation, and methods used to
quantify and analyze phenotypes that I detail below. With additional clarifications and details,
and possibly a partial re-analysis I believe this work will represent an important contribution to
science.
Major comments:
Definitions
I suggest that the authors scrutinize their definitions of important terms (e.g. chronotype,
personality) and state them explicitly in the introduction. Chronotype refers to a behavioral
manifestation of an individual’s underlying molecular biological clock. Distance travelled, which
is not related to biological timing, therefore doesn’t reflect a chronotype. Personality refers to
between-individual differences in their average level of a behavior, this behavioral consistency is
typically represented statistically by ‘repeatability’. The authors often refer to ‘personality-
related’ behaviors; I wonder what is meant by ‘related’? Is it not a personality?
Biological Rationale
The authors mix exploratory and hypothesis-testing approaches in their analyses. Some variables
are investigated because previous work suggest their importance, some are left out for
unexplained reasons, and all interactions are included without explanation, and stepwise model
selection is used to compare all possible models, rather than biological hypotheses. I would
suggest that the authors decide whether they are taking a testing versus exploratory approach
and be consistent throughout the manuscript.
Validation of Behavioral Scoring
It is difficult to phenotype animals without visual cues. The authors utilize acoustic data and an
automated statistical procedure to classify behavioral states. Without some reference to some
validation of this procedure (within this study, a similar previous study, or laboratory study) the
reader has no idea how reliable the phenotyping procedure is or what conditions influence its
accuracy.
Context of Measurement
Personality generally refers to consistency of behavior across contexts (e.g. breeding/non-
breeding, predation risk/no predation risk). The authors do not describe multiple contexts for
repeated measures. Presumably, the authors use subsequent days as independent contexts.
Although time can be considered a context, repeated measures should be collected under
independent environmental conditions (subsequent days uncorrelated). Repeatability estimates
are easily inflated by repeated measurements occurring too close together. The authors should
either present evidence that ‘days’ represent independent environmental data, account for the
dependence between consecutive measurements (autocorrelated data) and re-estimate
repeatability. See Dingemanse and Dochtermann 2013 ‘Quantifying individual variation in
behaviour’ for examples of ‘pseudorepeatability’.

Minor comments
Introduction:
At line 59, I would suggest the authors draw from the fish chronobiology literature, to introduce
the readers to circadian rhythms in activity/sleep in fish that are governed by molecular clocks
similar to those in mammals, rather than vaguely stating that fish ‘sleep’ depending on how you
define sleep. Regardless of whether the authors wish to speak about sleep in fish or sleep-like
behavior, they should give their working definition of what constitutes sleep in their organism.
Relatedly, is there any evidence for circadian rhythmicity in this species? Otherwise, there should
be a citation and statement about this family of fish typically being diurnal.
Methods:
The authors should provide information on the size of the transponder (%of average body
weight) and any information available regarding the influence of the tag, or tagging procedure on
fish survival or fitness.
Although the authors direct their readers to citations explaining how data were cleaned and
discarded, I would like an explanation in the text. E.g. what behavior patterns were considered
normal vs abnormal and what data was this based upon; how many days did it take for fish to
recover from tagging, and regain ‘normal behavior’ ; what is the general criteria for throwing out
spurious data.
Line 104: were any of the fish recorded during both years (this could be considered cross-
context)? Were the fish recorded on the same days? If so, that should be included as a random
effect reflecting unmeasured environmental conditions, or fixed if there are seasonal changes in
behavior.
Line 114: How did 5 minutes ensure resolution to detect an awakening? Do you mean 5min of
error in assigning awakening time was acceptable?
Line 118: what custom programming was required? If it was a manipulation to carry out a
modified statistical procedure then you should explain it.
Line 119: How much uncertainty is associated with the HMM process? As it is a Bayesian
procedure, shouldn’t there be a way to propagate this uncertainty to your subsequent analyses?
Line 132: what is home range behavior? Home range has a particular definition when quantified
in terrestrial animals, how do you define it and measure it?
Did your movement model include any relevant environmental covariates? How do these models
relate to your 5-min binned signal count data?
With small sample size its inappropriate to include highly collinear variables in the same model,
you should include a defense for keeping both latitude and longitude if you acknowledge that
they are strongly correlated. How is depth ‘indirectly’ incorporated? And what was your
biological reason for including it.
Line 157: How does DIC perform with small sample sizes? Does forward stepwise selection
suggest the same top model? Did you use a cut-off rule (e.g. delta AIC >2) for selecting a better-
performing model?
Line 165: repeatability is the between-individual variance divided by the sum of between-
individual and residual variance
Line 170: cite Nakagawa and Schielzeth 2010 repeatability for Gaussian and non-gaussian data,
for the definition of adjusted repeatability
Line 171: state your interpretation rather than referring elsewhere for it
Line 176: rest duration, onset, and offset are expected to be non-independent as duration is
calculated from onset and offset. This would a priori suggest a trivariate model is appropriate for
these. Why do you reduce to only bivariate models when you goal is to describe all four
behaviors together? One argument would be that your dataset is quite underpowered for such a
large model.
Line 181: repeatability cannot be less than zero, its 95%CI is bounded by zero (see nakagawa and
schielzeth 2010). How do you determine significance here?
Line 184: flat and uninformative priors are not equivalent. Tell us what prior you used.
4
Results:
Line 204: remove (and shallower water) unless you used it as a variable in the analysis
Line 216: you should specify that rp and rind correspond to covariance analysis here, the same
notation could equally describe repeatability from your univariate models.
Discussion:
Line 232: I don’t recall the authors ever introducing why spatial or temporal components would
be important in chronotypes.
Line 237: this claim is a stretch; you haven’t presented any data related to predation risk.
Line 238: if depth was the actual variable of interest, it should have been included rather than
longitude, which isn’t ecologically relevant to fish.
Lines 255-259: this is unnecessary, it only describes the variables
Line 281: how would your tracking have impacted R?
Table 1. Why is latitude/longitude treated as categorical, was this a typo? There should probably
be a citation for calculating a MC p-value.
Line 103: remove ‘for testing our hypothesis’ – or state a hypothesis to be tested
Line 105: change daily observations to ‘observation days’
Line 164: change to “between-individual variation”
Line 165: define personality-related chronotype; also I think your reference numbering is off: 11
isn’t about defining repeatability

This field-based study provides evidence for the existence of repeatable circadian and non-
circadian behavioral phenotypes in pearly razorfish. The authors state that these behaviors do not
covary at the between-individual level, and largely do not covary at the within-individual level
(except between awakening time and traveled distance) and thus represent independent
repeatable traits rather than forming a behavioral syndrome. The authors provide a revised
version of their manuscript and I commend them for successfully addressing most of the
previous comments on their paper. Although I am satisfied with how the authors have addressed
my previous concerns, I have a few additional minor comments on the revised manuscript that I
detail below. Additionally, I suggest that the authors do not refer to their treatment of
confounding variables (lat/long, sex, size, etc.) as a testing procedure. They were included
initially as confounding variables (not hypotheses to be tested) were submitted to DIC model-
selection (which, for example, selected models that did not include sex, and therefore the final,
used, model did not 'test' sex (you could state that models not including sex were more
parsimonious than with sex, but you shouldn't say it tested non-significant)) and a single model
was chosen. Subsequently, when a model-selection approach is followed p-values should not be
presented if independent data sets were not used for the selection and model-fitting steps
(parameter estimation), and they are uncorrected for the multiple-testing situation of model
selection and do not account for uncertainty in selecting a single model. In this case, without
independent data sets to perform model selection then estimation, I suggest that the authors
simply delete the p-mcmc values in table 1 and focus on the estimates and 95% BCIs (which they
already do).
I think it is also important to highlight the limitation of small between-individual sample size
(N=14 fish) as estimates of between-individual (co)variance will be associated with much greater
uncertainty than estimates of within-individual (co)variance (n=max14 repeats per fish) and is a
likely reason why few between-individual correlations were considered significant, even with
strong estimates (e.g. onset and awakening correlation = 0.57 strong but not significant).
I believe these points can easily be incorporated into the manuscript.
Minor comments:
line 75: technically, this isn't a hypothesis. Rephrase to something like:
fish harbor consistent between-individual differences in mean circadian behavioral phenotypes
across contexts.
Then your prediction would be something like:
If there is consistent behavioral differentiation in circadian phenotypes of fish then individuals'
ranking in a behavioral assay will remain the same when measured in multiple contexts. (or
statistically, the proportion of between-individual variance will be significantly larger than the
total variance)
line 76: this "test"ing could represent several additional hypotheses- 1 for each variable that
you've investigated in your lmms. Alternatively, literature suggests that they are confounding
variables, so you include them because they should be controlled for, but you are not interested
in testing them as hypotheses.
I would suggest that you outline the study to 'test' 2 things: repeatability of phenotypes
(controlling for influential variables), and integration of circadian phenotypes with other
personality traits or independently as a circadian phenotype syndrome. Don't 'test' your
confounding variables, just include them because there is evidence that they influence the
behavior.
line 96: put the sample size
11
line 162: I would like to see a biological justification (if there is one) for the selection of sex versus
size as the variable chosen to include here- e.g. are sex-dependent physiological differences in
circadian regulation stronger than size-dependent circadian differences? I expect there is more
previous evidence for sex-specific differences
line 171: I suggest to remove 'significant effects were discussed jointly' as I do not agree that you
should attribute the effect of latitude/longitude with grain size or depth without directly testing
it if you later argue that latitude and longitude also represent any number of unmeasured
variables. Its fine however, to speculate on the likely implications for grain size or depth in the
discussion. Similarly, if you choose to include lat/long instead of biologically relevant measures,
you should not present this part as hypothesis-testing, rather (as you write later) you include
whatever variables you have than might influence behavior, regardless of their interpretation, for
'better' estimates of adjusted repeatability.
line 219: delete 'recommended', and maybe exchange 'uninformative' with 'weak'; Dingemanse &
Dochtermann don't give recommendations for priors. Additionally, what you've used was an
inverse-Wishart prior (inverse gamma is a special case of inverse wishart for univariate models
only; multivariate models will be inverse-wishart (see Hadfield MCMCglmm Course Notes)).
Your specification of V=1 is also typical of univariate models. In bivariate models you would
specify the identity matrix V=diag(2) (as in Dingemanse & Dochtermann [37]) such that the
variances would equal 1 and covariances equal 0; you've coded both variance and covariance to
equal 1. As long as your data are not very sensitive to the priors, this shouldn't change your
results much.
line 260: replace (and decreasing the grainsize of the habitat) with (which is negatively correlated
with grain size of habitat)
line 278: replace 'shallower water' with 'higher longitudes'
line 282: because your final model did not include 'sex' as a variable, you didn't actually 'test' the
effect of sex on behaviors and subsequently, shouldn't say that you didn't find a relationship
between sex and behavior. Furthermore, if you don't test the effect of sex, then you shouldn't
speculate so much about relationships that you could have, but didn't test.
line 294: some researchers suggest that for more accurate estimates of repeatability when
repeatability is low one should increase repeated-measures, while when repeatability is high, one
should increase the number of individuals sampled. We see in your results table very large
uncertainty in estimates of between-individual variation and particularly the between-individual
correlations (because you've only sampled 14 individuals) and relatively less uncertainty in
residual correlations (because you have many within-individual samples). I would suggest that
you highlight the issue of small between-individual sample size down around line 325
(limitations) as you've estimated some relatively strong bivariate covariances that are probably
only non-significant because there is so much uncertainty when you have such a small sample
size. Even with high repeatability (~0.8) Dingemanse & Dochtermann's [37] simulations suggest
at least 25 individuals be used.
line 334: 'Fish balance...' start a new paragraph here.
Table 1: I did not find the term p-mcmc in reference [36] from line 181. I am unfamiliar with it,
but I might guess that its the percentage of MCMC iterations that are on the opposite side of zero
from the posterior mean, and correspond somewhat to a frequentist p-value. However, once
you've done model selection with DIC, similar to AIC, you should not present significance testing
p-values of parameters because this is a problem of uncorrected multiple testing and doesn't
account for uncertainty in model selection. Otherwise, you should use a separate dataset for
model selection versus estimation if you had more data. I would suggest to remove p-values and
12
focus on your parameter estimates with their 95%BCI, then you could put somewhere that you
consider any estimates who's 95%BCI do not overlap zero to be 'significant'.
Table S1: clarify that (n) number of days of tracking is after removing days because of abnormal
behavior after tagging. Remove 'circadian-related' from final sentence.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
Authors have done a good job in addressing my comments and agree the clarity of manuscript
has improved. I have only minor comment regarding the context of repeatability measurements.
Authors have decided to stick with their original intention to control repeatability for the context
of latitude and longitude of individual’s home range center instead for water depth and habitat
type (i.e. grain size) as suggested by reviewer 1 and me. I agree that these two habitat factors
were closely correlated to lat and lon as authors demonstrated in convincing figure S1. However,
I still think that authors didn’t fully explain why they used the geographical position instead of
the direct data on habitat quality. I suggest authors to provide results of the alternative analyses

Comments to the Author(s)
Authors have done a good job in addressing my comments and agree the clarity of manuscript
has improved. I have only minor comment regarding the context of repeatability measurements.
Authors have decided to stick with their original intention to control repeatability for the context
of latitude and longitude of individual’s home range center instead for water depth and habitat
type (i.e. grain size) as suggested by reviewer 1 and me. I agree that these two habitat factors
were closely correlated to lat and lon as authors demonstrated in convincing figure S1. However,
I still think that authors didn’t fully explain why they used the geographical position instead of
the direct data on habitat quality. I suggest authors to provide results of the alternative analyses
(i.e. controlling for depth and bottom grain size) as supplementary material, and to specify which
are the “variables not sampled that co-varied spatially” with lat and lon in the main text of the
manuscript. This should clarify their decision and provide valuable information for future
research.
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This field-based study provides evidence for the existence of repeatable circadian and non-
circadian behavioral phenotypes in pearly razorfish. The authors state that these behaviors do not
covary at the between-individual level, and largely do not covary at the within-individual level
(except between awakening time and traveled distance) and thus represent independent
repeatable traits rather than forming a behavioral syndrome. The authors provide a revised
version of their manuscript and I commend them for successfully addressing most of the
previous comments on their paper. Although I am satisfied with how the authors have addressed
my previous concerns, I have a few additional minor comments on the revised manuscript that I
detail below. Additionally, I suggest that the authors do not refer to their treatment of
confounding variables (lat/long, sex, size, etc.) as a testing procedure. They were included
initially as confounding variables (not hypotheses to be tested) were submitted to DIC model-
selection (which, for example, selected models that did not include sex, and therefore the final,
used, model did not 'test' sex (you could state that models not including sex were more
parsimonious than with sex, but you shouldn't say it tested non-significant)) and a single model
was chosen. Subsequently, when a model-selection approach is followed p-values should not be
presented if independent data sets were not used for the selection and model-fitting steps
(parameter estimation), and they are uncorrected for the multiple-testing situation of model
selection and do not account for uncertainty in selecting a single model. In this case, without
independent data sets to perform model selection then estimation, I suggest that the authors
simply delete the p-mcmc values in table 1 and focus on the estimates and 95% BCIs (which they
already do).
I think it is also important to highlight the limitation of small between-individual sample size
(N=14 fish) as estimates of between-individual (co)variance will be associated with much greater
uncertainty than estimates of within-individual (co)variance (n=max14 repeats per fish) and is a
likely reason why few between-individual correlations were considered significant, even with
strong estimates (e.g. onset and awakening correlation = 0.57 strong but not significant).
I believe these points can easily be incorporated into the manuscript.
Minor comments:
line 75: technically, this isn't a hypothesis. Rephrase to something like:
fish harbor consistent between-individual differences in mean circadian behavioral phenotypes
across contexts.
16
Then your prediction would be something like:
If there is consistent behavioral differentiation in circadian phenotypes of fish then individuals'
ranking in a behavioral assay will remain the same when measured in multiple contexts. (or
statistically, the proportion of between-individual variance will be significantly larger than the
total variance)
line 76: this "test"ing could represent several additional hypotheses- 1 for each variable that
you've investigated in your lmms. Alternatively, literature suggests that they are confounding
variables, so you include them because they should be controlled for, but you are not interested
in testing them as hypotheses.
I would suggest that you outline the study to 'test' 2 things: repeatability of phenotypes
(controlling for influential variables), and integration of circadian phenotypes with other
personality traits or independently as a circadian phenotype syndrome. Don't 'test' your
confounding variables, just include them because there is evidence that they influence the
behavior.
line 96: put the sample size
line 162: I would like to see a biological justification (if there is one) for the selection of sex versus
size as the variable chosen to include here- e.g. are sex-dependent physiological differences in
circadian regulation stronger than size-dependent circadian differences? I expect there is more
previous evidence for sex-specific differences
line 171: I suggest to remove 'significant effects were discussed jointly' as I do not agree that you
should attribute the effect of latitude/longitude with grain size or depth without directly testing
it if you later argue that latitude and longitude also represent any number of unmeasured
variables. Its fine however, to speculate on the likely implications for grain size or depth in the
discussion. Similarly, if you choose to include lat/long instead of biologically relevant measures,
you should not present this part as hypothesis-testing, rather (as you write later) you include
whatever variables you have than might influence behavior, regardless of their interpretation, for
'better' estimates of adjusted repeatability.
line 219: delete 'recommended', and maybe exchange 'uninformative' with 'weak'; Dingemanse &
Dochtermann don't give recommendations for priors. Additionally, what you've used was an
inverse-Wishart prior (inverse gamma is a special case of inverse wishart for univariate models
only; multivariate models will be inverse-wishart (see Hadfield MCMCglmm Course Notes)).
Your specification of V=1 is also typical of univariate models. In bivariate models you would
specify the identity matrix V=diag(2) (as in Dingemanse & Dochtermann [37]) such that the
variances would equal 1 and covariances equal 0; you've coded both variance and covariance to
equal 1. As long as your data are not very sensitive to the priors, this shouldn't change your
results much.
line 260: replace (and decreasing the grainsize of the habitat) with (which is negatively correlated
with grain size of habitat)
line 278: replace 'shallower water' with 'higher longitudes'
line 282: because your final model did not include 'sex' as a variable, you didn't actually 'test' the
effect of sex on behaviors and subsequently, shouldn't say that you didn't find a relationship
between sex and behavior. Furthermore, if you don't test the effect of sex, then you shouldn't
speculate so much about relationships that you could have, but didn't test.
line 294: some researchers suggest that for more accurate estimates of repeatability when
repeatability is low one should increase repeated-measures, while when repeatability is high, one
17
should increase the number of individuals sampled. We see in your results table very large
uncertainty in estimates of between-individual variation and particularly the between-individual
correlations (because you've only sampled 14 individuals) and relatively less uncertainty in
residual correlations (because you have many within-individual samples). I would suggest that
you highlight the issue of small between-individual sample size down around line 325
(limitations) as you've estimated some relatively strong bivariate covariances that are probably
only non-significant because there is so much uncertainty when you have such a small sample
size. Even with high repeatability (~0.8) Dingemanse & Dochtermann's [37] simulations suggest
at least 25 individuals be used.
line 334: 'Fish balance...' start a new paragraph here.
Table 1: I did not find the term p-mcmc in reference [36] from line 181. I am unfamiliar with it,
but I might guess that its the percentage of MCMC iterations that are on the opposite side of zero
from the posterior mean, and correspond somewhat to a frequentist p-value. However, once
you've done model selection with DIC, similar to AIC, you should not present significance testing
p-values of parameters because this is a problem of uncorrected multiple testing and doesn't
account for uncertainty in model selection. Otherwise, you should use a separate dataset for
model selection versus estimation if you had more data. I would suggest to remove p-values and
focus on your parameter estimates with their 95%BCI, then you could put somewhere that you
consider any estimates who's 95%BCI do not overlap zero to be 'significant'.
Table S1: clarify that (n) number of days of tracking is after removing days because of abnormal
behavior after tagging. Remove 'circadian-related' from final sentence.

Appendix A
Summary
This study demonstrates occurrence of repeatable inter-individual differences in
circadian pattern of behavior of pearly razorfish, Xyrithchys novacula in a field
using acoustic telemetry. The manuscript could be an important contribution to
the growing field of animal personality research, which generally lacks well-
designed field studies. However, I’m not fully convinced that this study presents
“the first evidence of personality-related chronotypes in fish (lines 33-34).” First
I thought that it was a bit unclear to which of commonly scored personality traits
(activity, boldness, sociability, aggression or exploration) is according to authors
this variation in circadian behavior related. Although authors suggest at the end
of discussion (259 - 261) that it could be indirectly related to activity, arguing
that circadian behavior in this study was correlated to daily travel distance,
which has been found to correspond to activity in the sense of its definition in
Reale et al. 2007 in some other species. I found this to be relatively poor
argument, because one can potentially argue that distance moved per day is
often also related to boldness or explorative behavior for example. I would more
agree with the second suggestion of the authors that circadian activity or
chronotypes can be seen an independent axis of the animal personality. Another
reason why I’m not convinced that this study is the first evidence of distinct
inter-individual differences of circadian activity in fish is a recent study Zavorka
et al. 2016, showing the link between laboratory scored activity measured using
the open-field test and circadian patterns of detectability in the field in juvenile
brown trout. There is also an earlier work by Slavík and Horky (2010) based,
similarly to the present study, only on the field observation using
electromyogram telemetric sensors in European catfish, which shows significant
inter-individual differences in muscles activity (i.e. indicator of movement)
response to diurnal changes of light intensity.
I can also see a weakness of the present study in the fact that it is based only on
field observations, and thus authors cannot rule out the option that the observed
repeatability of inter-individual differences in circadian behavioral patterns is
inflated by differences in environment where individuals occur. It has been
shown that differences in behavior among individuals can be driven by the
position of individuals in the social structure or by ambient physical
environment (i.e. pseudo-repeatability Conrad et al. 2011; Dingemanse and
Dochtermann 2013; Campioni et al. 2016). This problem can be partially avoided
by adjusting R values for environmental factors, which are expected to cause the
inflation of inter-individual differences. In order to do that authors adjusted their
R values to latitudinal and longitudinal position of home range center of each
individual. However, authors do not explain how are these values related to
some relevant environmental factors except the positive correlation between
water depth and longitude. At the same time authors seem to have some direct
data about bottom habitat type and water depth (see Fig S1), which are in my
opinion ecologically more relevant factors than geographical position of
individuals given relatively small spatial range of the study area. I would
encourage authors to adjust R for water depth and habitat type for each place
where individuals hide over night i.e. controlling for exposition to environmental
variability both within and among individuals. If this would not be possible, than
authors may control at least for the habitat and depth in the center of individuals
home range similarly like they did with lat and lon in the present version of the
manuscript. I also noted that authors in general tend to exaggerate some of their
statements by overgeneralizing their findings or findings of other studies. This is
to some extend natural, since authors should highlight importance of their work,
but I have a feeling that in the case of this manuscript it reduces readability and
clarity of the text (I have highlighted a few examples bellow).
Finally I would like to emphasize that this is good and very interesting study and
I believe that authors can deal with my comments by some additional data
analyses and by downplaying and specifying of some of their statements.
Specific comments
1) Consider a change of the title to emphasize that this is a field study. Foe
example: “Repeatability of circadian behavioral variation revealed in free
ranging marine fish.”
2) L.: 19-20 Awkward sentence, please simplify.
3) L.: 25-27 I couldn’t understand the sentence before I read the manuscript,
please reformulate and specify for which environmental factor you controlled.
4) L.: 29-30 See my comments in summary regarding the usage of the term
“personality-related chronotype”.
5) L: 50-52 and 57-58 There are already some studies in fishes showing in
consentient inter-individual differences in behavior related to circadian cycles
(see my comments in the summary).
6) L: 90 Please provide coordinates of the study area.
7) L: 92 Provide details about the fish mass and tag weigh.
8) L: 120 – 121 Is it possible that individual emerged from the send and than
hide in again during a short intervals around the sunrise and sunset? I have no
expertise with the behavior of the model species, but I can imagine such a
behavior as animals can sample their environment before they definitely decide
to emerge from or hide to a shelter. If that was the case, authors could get some
bias in estimation of awaking time compare to the rest onset as the first A bin
could be followed by A-R transition but the last A bin cannot be followed by A-R
transition.
9) L: 154-155: Specify whether you used fish id as a random intercept or also as
a random slope to some fixed factor.
10) L: 218 “We therefore discarded the existence of a circadian-related
behavioural syndrome” is rather strong general statement for which you really
don’t have support in your results, consider downplaying (specifying) or
removing it.
11) L: 225 – 226 Could you suggest some explanation of the difference in
awakening time and rest duration between the years?
12) 231-233 Awkward sentence please reformulate.
13) L: 249 – 254 See my comments regarding pseudo-repeatability in the
summary.
14) L: 291 – 293 I don’t see how the studies you refer to support your statement
regarding the fishing selection since they are all focus on birds. Please
reformulate the sentence or provide some more relevant references.

Dear Editor,
We are very grateful for the comments and suggestions provided by you and the two
reviewers related to our manuscript entitled “Repeatability of circadian behavioral variation
revealed in free ranging marine fish (Manuscript ID RSOS-160791)”. Please find attached a
revised version and a response to reviewers
All comments made by the reviewers have been addressed in the revised version. Below you
can find the list of the comments made by both reviewers followed by our responses and the
changes made in the manuscript. The manuscript has been strongly improved after the
revision process, for which we are very grateful to both reviewers.
Responses to reviewers (in blue):
Reviwer#1 (Dr. Erica Stuber)
The authors investigate the existence of consistent between-individual differences
(personality) in biological rhythms in fish, a group often overlooked in studies of animal
personality. Their objectives were to quantify the repeatability of four behaviors related to
individuals’ chronotype (awakening time, rest onset, rest-duration, and daily activity) between
individuals using repeated measures, and to describe the covariance structure of these
behaviors. The authors track 14 free-living marked individuals during two years, and quantify
behavioral phenotypes based on acoustic tracking. Results demonstrate relatively high
repeatability in all behaviors measured, however there was no evidence for a sleep-related
behavioral syndrome in these fish. I applaud the authors for investigating personality and
biological rhythms in a system that is difficult to study. However, I have reservations about the
foundation, motivation, and methods used to quantify and analyze phenotypes that I detail
below. With additional clarifications and details, and possibly a partial re-analysis I believe this
work will represent an important contribution to science.
We really appreciate and thank all constrictive and useful comments made by Dr. Erica Stuber
to our manuscript. We are glad to hear from her it could provide an important contribution to
science (as we do). All of her comments and concerns have been carefully considered, clarified
and revised in revised version of the manuscript.
Major comments:
Definitions
I suggest that the authors scrutinize their definitions of important terms (e.g. chronotype,
personality) and state them explicitly in the introduction. Chronotype refers to a behavioral
manifestation of an individual’s underlying molecular biological clock. Distance travelled,
which is not related to biological timing, therefore doesn’t reflect a chronotype. Personality
refers to between-individual differences in their average level of a behavior, this behavioral
consistency is typically represented statistically by ‘repeatability’. The authors often refer to
‘personality-related’ behaviors; I wonder what is meant by ‘related’? Is it not a personality?
We agree with the Dr Stuber about these comments. We have clarified the definitions for the
terms chronotype (see lines 43-47), distance travelled (see lines 139-154) and repeatability
reviewers (see also general comments by reviwer#2), and we have clearly separated
crhonotypes (circadian behaviors that are repeatable) from distance travelled (which is a
standard personality trait in fish) in the revised version of the manuscript (see some examples
of clarifications in abstract or in lines 121-154). We have therefore removed the term
personality-related chronotype throughout the manuscript (also see the first response to
reviwer#2 for more details).
Biological Rationale
The authors mix exploratory and hypothesis-testing approaches in their analyses. Some
variables are investigated because previous work suggest their importance, some are left out
for unexplained reasons, and all interactions are included without explanation, and stepwise
model selection is used to compare all possible models, rather than biological hypotheses. I
would suggest that the authors decide whether they are taking a testing versus exploratory
approach and be consistent throughout the manuscript.
We agree with the Dr Stuber that hypothesis approach was not properly explained. The main
hypothesis was to assess (hypothesis-testing) the existence of chronotypes (or repeatable
circadian behavioral variation) in a marine free-ranging fish (cited from the main text) (see
lines 76-85). This hypothesis testing requires the decomposing of the raw phenotypic variance
into between- and within-individual (Nakagawa & Schielzeth 2010). However, the estimation
of repeatability (R) in circadian behavioral variation requires assessing some additional
hypothesis beforehand. In fact, behavioural variation can be influenced by the environment
(e.g. depth or habitat) and some environmental factors (or covariates) should be included in
the model estimating R (adjusted-R) (Dingemanse & Dochtermann 2013). This is especially
relevant in field (Harrison et al. 2014). A clear example from our work is the estimation of R for
the rest onset of the fish. The darkness arrives early in individuals inhabiting deeper waters
while later to individuals inhabiting shallower waters. This would lead a biased R because
between –individual differences in the rest onset are caused because depth differences (thus R
does not represent a characteristic of the individual). Because that reason we have to
statistically control for the effect of depth.
The selection of environmental variables to be modelled was strictly based according to
statistical support (model selection): we feel this approach to select the environmental
variables to test afterward is more robust. However, 3 variables were removed before the
model selection: depth, habitat and fish size. The removal of these three variables was also
statistically based, but poorly explained in the previous version of the manuscript. Co-linearity
(or the inclusion of two variables that are highly correlated) may lead inaccurate model
parameterization and wrong interpretation of the results (see lines 156-174). Fish size was
clearly correlated with sex (our species is a protogynious hermaphrodite); and habitat and
depth were strongly correlated with the latitude and the longitude of the centre of the home
range, respectively (see a response to reviwer#2). Thus, to avoid co-linearity issues we selected
one of this paired to be incorporated in the model (but were interpreted jointly, lines 258-
289). Model selection was considered for final optimization of the model (see line 184). But we
agree with the reviewer that this was not well explained in the previous manuscript. We have
widely edited the introduction and methods for clarity (see for example edits in lines 156-174).
Validation of Behavioral Scoring
It is difficult to phenotype animals without visual cues. The authors utilize acoustic data and an
automated statistical procedure to classify behavioral states. Without some reference to some
validation of this procedure (within this study, a similar previous study, or laboratory study)
the reader has no idea how reliable the phenotyping procedure is or what conditions influence
its accuracy.
However, the acoustic tracking data is specially indicated to study active/resting in the field,
and especially in the case of the pearly razorfish (see movie S1). The method to estimate
active/resting patterns using tracking data was published in a previous study by ours (Alós et
al. 2012). In this previous we demonstrated that the detection pattern clearly reveals the
active/resting, while controlling for mobility of the individual and the environmental
influences. Thus, this previous study demonstrated that when individual are buried in the
sand, the detection probability is drastically reduced (this is what the pattern of detection
shows in our study, see clear pattern in Fig. 2). Acoustic tracking to detect behavioral modes
(active/resting) has been also used in other similar species and constitutes a robust method to
identify circadian rhythms (see for example March et al. 2010, Alós et al. 2011). Thus, there is
enough information validating the use of acoustic tracking to detect behavioral modes
(active/resting). Regarding the use of the automatic method based in a HMM to classify
behavior, it nicely and accurately reproduces the active/resting pattern when one compares
the observed with the predicted results (see Fig. 2 and a response to this reviewer below). We
clarified this concern throughout the manuscript (see all edits and clarifications made in
section (a) and (b) of the M&M).
Context of Measurement
Personality generally refers to consistency of behavior across contexts (e.g. breeding/non-
breeding, predation risk/no predation risk). The authors do not describe multiple contexts for
repeated measures. Presumably, the authors use subsequent days as independent contexts.
Although time can be considered a context, repeated measures should be collected under
independent environmental conditions (subsequent days uncorrelated). Repeatability
estimates are easily inflated by repeated measurements occurring too close together. The
authors should either present evidence that ‘days’ represent independent environmental data,
account for the dependence between consecutive measurements (autocorrelated data) and
re-estimate repeatability. See Dingemanse and Dochtermann 2013 ‘Quantifying individual
variation in behaviour’ for examples of ‘pseudorepeatability’.
We fully agree with this comment. Note that the reference suggested by Dr Stuber was
considered throughout of the manuscript for proper analysis of the data, and the concern
mentioned by her was already considered and discussed in the previous version of the
manuscript (see discussion lines 326-332 according to Biro & Stamps 2015, a manuscript that
specifically consider the effects of temporal auto-correlation in R). The limited size of the
pearly razorfish required the use of very small acoustic tags, with a life-span of only a few days
(this is a limitation as we could not consider other context as suggested by the Dr Stuber).
Regarding the temporal auto-correlation, the scaled residuals of the models were used to
explore the existence of temporal autocorrelation using the Durbin-Watson statistic (R-library
DHARMa). In all cases, alternative hypothesis (true autocorrelation is greater than 0) were
rejected ([Awaking time (DW = 2.0778, p-value = 0.6891), Rest onset (DW = 2.1221, p-value =
0.7807), Rest duration (DW = 2.0837, p-value = 0.6959) and Daily activity (DW = 2.1972, p-
value = 0.8946) (we have included this new test and result in the revised manuscript, see lines
202-201)]. However, we agree with Dr Stuber with the need for an increase of the time
window and the inclusion of context to get a broader picture of the repeatability of the
circadian behaviors. Thus, although we feel is a safe conclusion that circadian behaviors are
repeatable, we recommend extending the tracking experiments, not only on time (tracking
days), but also across contexts (e.g. spawning season) as suggested by the reviewer (see eg
lines 283-289, 326-332).
Minor comments
Introduction:
introduce the readers to circadian rhythms in activity/sleep in fish that are governed by
molecular clocks similar to those in mammals, rather than vaguely stating that fish ‘sleep’
depending on how you define sleep. Regardless of whether the authors wish to speak about
sleep in fish or sleep-like behavior, they should give their working definition of what
constitutes sleep in their organism.
We thank this comment. We have included the idea “activity/sleep” in fish that are governed
by molecular clocks” and removed the idea of fish ‘sleep’ depending on how you define sleep
(see lines 45-47 and 65-75).
Relatedly, is there any evidence for circadian rhythmicity in this species? Otherwise, there
should be a citation and statement about this family of fish typically being diurnal.
Yes, there is a citation describing the diurnal behavior of this species, we have revised the text
for clarity (see the part of the description of the species, see lines 89-90).
Methods:
The authors should provide information on the size of the transponder (%of average body
weight) and any information available regarding the influence of the tag, or tagging procedure
on fish survival or fitness. Although the authors direct their readers to citations explaining how
data were cleaned and discarded, I would like an explanation in the text. E.g. what behavior
patterns were considered normal vs abnormal and what data was this based upon; how many
days did it take for fish to recover from tagging, and regain ‘normal behavior’ ; what is the
general criteria for throwing out spurious data.
We agree with the Dr Stuber with the fact that tagging procedures were not well explained
and we have included all of these details requested by her (we referred tagging methods and
effects to our previous descriptive manuscript). First we have included the size of the
transponder and how it relates with the % of average body weight and, in general, we have
revised the tagging procedures for clarity (see lines 102-104 and we have included a new
citation, Alós et al. 2016b). Second, we have provided the details of what was considered
abnormal behavior; how we assessed the days did it take for fish to recover from tagging; and
what is the general criteria for throwing out spurious data (see lines 110-119 and see Table S1
for the number of days tracked).
Line 104: were any of the fish recorded during both years (this could be considered cross-
context)? Were the fish recorded on the same days? If so, that should be included as a random
effect reflecting unmeasured environmental conditions, or fixed if there are seasonal changes
in behavior.
That would be ideal, however, the limited size of the pearly razorfish required the use of very
small acoustic tags, with a life-span of only three weeks. Thus, we had to consider year as
independent experiments, as individuals tracked were not the same (i.e., we cannot test for
two contexts). We have discussed this idea in the revised version (see discussion lines 326-
332).
Line 114: How did 5 minutes ensure resolution to detect an awakening? Do you mean 5min of
error in assigning awakening time was acceptable?
Considering that awakening time in this species ranges from -16 to 480 min to the sunrise
(with a mean and s.d. of 117.9 ± 85.1 min) (see 231 and Table S1), we really feel that 5 min
provides enough resolution for testing our hypothesis.
Line 118: what custom programming was required? If it was a manipulation to carry out a
modified statistical procedure then you should explain it.
(lines 121-138).
Line 119: How much uncertainty is associated with the HMM process? As it is a Bayesian
procedure, shouldn’t there be a way to propagate this uncertainty to your subsequent
analyses?
This is a misunderstanding; the HHM is not fitted using a Bayesian approach. When we said
“probabilistically” we mean that we estimate the transition probability matrix that determines
the states. The method fitted the data using log-likehood methods (specifically the
expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm). The HHM was very efficient into classify behavior
(see Fig. 2). We have changed the test for clarity (see revised lines 121-138).
Line 132: what is home range behavior? Home range has a particular definition when
quantified in terrestrial animals, how do you define it and measure it?
The home range concept is also widely used in aquatic animals (see review Hussey et al. 2015
in Science) , and especially in fish (see review Botsford et al. 2009), but certainly we didn’t
provide a definition for non-aquatic readers in our previous version of the manuscript (a
definition with the proper citation is included in the revised version, see lines 148).
Did your movement model include any relevant environmental covariates? How do these
models relate to your 5-min binned signal count data?
Regarding the first question, environmental data was used to properly retrieve the positional
data (see details in Alós et al. 2016a). We have clarified this information (see line 146-154).
We are sorry, but do not fully understand the second question by the reviewer. The movement
model was used for estimating activity (as daily traveled distance, see lines 139-154), while the
5-min binned signal count data was used to estimate the awakening time relative to sunrise
(min) as the first bin for daily active behaviour, ii) the rest onset related to sunset (min) as the
last bin for daily active behaviour, and iii) the rest duration (hours) as the time difference
between the rest onset of the previous day and the awakening time of the current day. Thus,
they essentially are different traits estimated using a different approach.
With small sample size its inappropriate to include highly collinear variables in the same
model, you should include a defense for keeping both latitude and longitude if you
acknowledge that they are strongly correlated. How is depth ‘indirectly’ incorporated? And
what was your biological reason for including it.
We agree with the reviewer and highly co-linear variables were not included (see more details
in the response to this reviewer about the Biological Rationale above).
Line 157: How does DIC perform with small sample sizes? Does forward stepwise selection
suggest the same top model? Did you use a cut-off rule (e.g. delta AIC >2) for selecting a
better-performing model?
The DIC is equivalent to the natural model-robust version of the AIC in Bayesian statistics, it
estimates the number of effective parameters directly from the data and the idea is that
models with smaller DIC should be preferred to models with larger DIC (Shriner & Yi 2009) (i.e.
the model with the small DIC was selected). In our list of candidate models, we would expect
that the list would remain static as the sample size increased according to Spiegelhalter et al.
(2002). Therefore, we feel that models selection using the DIC is the proper approach to find
the most parsimonious model in our data (as widely used in models selection using a Bayesian
approach). We used only a cut-off rule for testing the significance of adjusted-Rs and in
bivariate LMM (see lines 208-213) according to (Harrison et al. 2014). Regarding model
selection direction, we used “step-by-step” backward reduction, which means that is a
combination of the backward and forward (then they are equivalent). However this fact was
elimination” for clarity (see line 184-186).
Line 165: repeatability is the between-individual variance divided by the sum of between-
individual and residual variance
Revised (see line 191).
Line 170: cite Nakagawa and Schielzeth 2010 repeatability for Gaussian and non-gaussian data,
for the definition of adjusted repeatability
Done (see line 195).
Line 171: state your interpretation rather than referring elsewhere for it
Revised (see lines 197-199). Also see the response below regarding the new significance test
included.
Line 176: rest duration, onset, and offset are expected to be non-independent as duration is
calculated from onset and offset. This would a priori suggest a trivariate model is appropriate
for these. Why do you reduce to only bivariate models when you goal is to describe all four
behaviors together? One argument would be that your dataset is quite underpowered for such
a large model.
Our results say that awaking time, rest onset and rest duration are independent (see results
section lines 252-256 and Table 2). Note how rest duration is calculated using the rest onset of
the previous day and this could be the reason (see line 131). Thus, bivariate LMMs is a proper
approach to detect behavioral syndromes according to Dingemanse & Dochtermann (2013).
Moreover it is widely used approach to explore the existence of behavioral syndrome in the
wild (Harrison et al. 2014). Thus our approach is supported by the literature. Also, see line 320
in the discussion “Considering the number of observations and the repeatability scores in our
traits, the power of our data-set should be high enough to detect behavioural syndromes
(Dingemanse & Dochtermann 2013)”.
Line 181: repeatability cannot be less than zero, its 95%CI is bounded by zero (see nakagawa
and schielzeth 2010). How do you determine significance here?
We agree with the reviewer. We include a new Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) to calculate the
significance of the adjusted-R scores as recommended by the reviewer according to Nakagawa
& Schielzeth 2010 and Dingemanse & Dochtermann 2013) (see lines 197-204 and results).
Line 184: flat and uninformative priors are not equivalent. Tell us what prior you used.
This was a mistake. Priors are now provided (see lines 218-221).
Results:
Line 204: remove (and shallower water) unless you used it as a variable in the analysis
We agree with the reviewer and we have removed “shallower water”.
Line 216: you should specify that rp and rind correspond to covariance analysis here, the same
notation could equally describe repeatability from your univariate models.
Included (see lines 252-256).
Discussion:
Line 232: I don’t recall the authors ever introducing why spatial or temporal components
would be important in chronotypes.
The use of co-variates is key to avoid biased estimations of R (see lines 156 -174). This concern
with the co-linearity issues is discussed in a previous response to this reviewer and we feel we
or lines 258-289).
Line 237: this claim is a stretch; you haven’t presented any data related to predation risk.
In the M&M is widely explained (including references) that this species bury itself in the sand
to avoid predation (see lines 88-96). We have included a reference in the discussion for clarity
(see line 277).
Line 238: if depth was the actual variable of interest, it should have been included rather than
longitude, which isn’t ecologically relevant to fish.
We agree with the reviewer, but Longitude can be correlated with other variables not sampled
here. Considering Longitude/or latitude we can not say what is the exact mechanism that
causes the relationship, but we are incorporating all as co-variates (this is explained in the
M&M lines 156-174 and widely discussed in lines 258-289). The main objective is to determine
the maximum number of variables that can affect repeatability to be considered as co-variate
when testing our working hypothesis (also see first response to this reviewer).
Lines 255-259: this is unnecessary, it only describes the variables
We have edited the text (see lines 290-306), but we feel is important to highlight what are the
three new behavioral axis proposed here, in a similar way that conventional personality traits
are presented (for example bold-shy).
Line 281: how would your tracking have impacted R?
Regarding this question, see response to this reviewer “Validation of Behavioral Scoring” and
several questions regarding the M&M. We feel we properly addressed this concern.
Table 1. Why is latitude/longitude treated as categorical, was this a typo? There should
probably be a citation for calculating a MC p-value.
We are sorry but we do not fully understand the first comment. The figure caption says
“Latitude and longitude refer the position in UTM (zone 31S) of the centre of the home range
and year was treated as categorical (showed the estimated of 2012 with respect 2011).”. Thus
we feel is clear that year is treated as factor as only two year exists . However, we have
slightly edited the table caption for clarity. Regarding the second comment, a reference has
been included (see line 181).
Line 103: remove ‘for testing our hypothesis’ – or state a hypothesis to be tested
The hypothesis has been included (see line 117)
Line 105: change daily observations to ‘observation days’
Changed
Line 164: change to “between-individual variation”
Changed
Line 165: define personality-related chronotype; also I think your reference numbering is off:
11 isn’t about defining repeatability
Regarding the first part see the first response to this reviewer. Definitions have been widely
edited (see first response to this reviewer). Regarding the second part, Ref. 11 has been
removed here, it was a typo.

pattern of behavior of pearly razorfish, Xyrithchys novacula in a field using acoustic telemetry.
The manuscript could be an important contribution to the growing field of animal personality
research, which generally lacks well designed field studies.
We thank the reviewer for all these positive comments.
However, I’m not fully convinced that this study presents “the first evidence of personality-
related chronotypes in fish (lines 33-34).” First I thought that it was a bit unclear to which of
commonly scored personality traits (activity, boldness, sociability, aggression or exploration) is
according to authors this variation in circadian behavior related. Although authors suggest at
the end of discussion (259 - 261) that it could be indirectly related to activity, arguing that
circadian behavior in this study was correlated to daily travel distance, which has been found
to correspond to activity in the sense of its definition in Reale et al. 2007 in some other
species. I found this to be relatively poor argument, because one can potentially argue that
distance moved per day is often also related to boldness or explorative behavior for example. I
would more agree with the second suggestion of the authors that circadian activity or
chronotypes can be seen an independent axis of the animal personality.
We agree with the reviewer about this comment. We have widely revised the manuscript and
moved to story from “personality-related chronotypes” to “chronotypes revealed here are
seen an independent axis of the animal personality” according to this suggestion and a
suggestion made by reviewer one. We feel this concern has been properly addressed in the
revised version of the manuscript (see more details in the first response of the reviewer #1).
Another reason why I’m not convinced that this study is the first evidence of distinct inter-
individual differences of circadian activity in fish is a recent study Zavorka et al. 2016, showing
the link between laboratory scored activity measured using the open-field test and circadian
patterns of detectability in the field in juvenile brown trout. There is also an earlier work by
Slavík and Horky (2010) based, similarly to the present study, only on the field observation
using electromyogram telemetric sensors in European catfish, which shows significant inter-
individual differences in muscles activity (i.e. indicator of movement) response to diurnal
changes of light intensity.
Závorka et al. (2016), which has just came out, explored the diel behavior in the brown trout
parr, while Slavík & Horký (2012) used electromyogram telemetric sensors to detect diel
variation in European catfish. While both of them are interesting, they cover different
objectives than ours. Both of them do not measured Repeatability as is our main objective (as
is the score used for consistent between-individuals differences), do not consider chronotypes
in the sense of using behavioral like awakening time relative to sunrise (min), rest onset
related to sunset (min) and rest duration (hours) as they are defined (they mainly used
activity), and do not use any personality trait as us in our approach (at least, in the second
case). Both of them explore diel behaviors but do not decompose variance in among- and
within-individuals to explore the existence of repeatable behavior in traits that are linked to
chronotypes (see lines 43 -45, e.g. individuals that consistently woke up early in the morning
than other, as in birds have been observed Stuber et al. 2015). We therefore feel that our
contribution is the first work describing circadian behaviors that are repeatable, and they are
independent of personality. Ours and their works are essentially different with different
objectives. However, both of the citations suggested by the reviewers constitute to be missing
citations in the previous version and have been included in the manuscript. Thanks for this
suggestion.
I can also see a weakness of the present study in the fact that it is based only on field
observations, and thus authors cannot rule out the option that the observed repeatability of
inter individual differences in circadian behavioral patterns is inflated by differences in
individuals can be driven by the position of individuals in the social structure or by ambient
physical environment (i.e. pseudo-repeatability Conrad et al. 2011; Dingemanse and
Dochtermann 2013; Campioni et al. 2016). This problem can be partially avoided by adjusting R
values for environmental factors, which are expected to cause the inflation of inter-individual
differences. In order to do that authors adjusted their R values to latitudinal and longitudinal
position of home range center of each individual. However, authors do not explain how are
these values related to some relevant environmental factors except the positive correlation
between water depth and longitude. At the same time authors seem to have some direct data
about bottom habitat type and water depth (see Fig S1), which are in my opinion ecologically
more relevant factors than geographical position of individuals given relatively small spatial
range of the study area. I would encourage authors to adjust R for water depth and habitat
type for each place where individuals hide overnight i.e. controlling for exposition to
environmental variability both within and among individuals. If this would not be possible,
than authors may control at least for the habitat and depth in the center of individuals home
range similarly like they did with lat and lon in the present version of the manuscript.
We agree with the reviewers and we have widely clarified this in a response to the reviewer#1
(see response to Biological Rationale for more details). Habitat and depth are highly correlated
with latitude and longitude of the center of the home range (see Fig 1 of this response letter
and parameters of the relationship and p-values in the manuscript, lines 146-174), because of
that reason they cannot be included together in the model (this would lead co-linearity in
LMM which induce wrong fitting and biased model parameters, see more details in the
response to the reviewer #1). We have selected latitude and longitude of the centre of the
home range to be incorporated in the model (as they not only provide information about the
habitat and water depth, but also other variables not sampled that co-varied spatially) to avoid
co-linearity issues. However, significant effects were discussed jointly (latitude-habitat and
longitude-depth). We feel our approach is the statistically proper for the objective of our work
(estimate repeatability while controlling for variables), and we feel with this response and the
previous one to the reviewer #1 we have properly addressed this issue (see revised M&M).

I also noted that authors in general tend to exaggerate some of their statements by
overgeneralizing their findings or findings of other studies. This is to some extend natural,
since authors should highlight importance of their work, but I have a feeling that in the case of
this manuscript it reduces readability and clarity of the text (I have highlighted a few examples
below).
We have revised this concern throughout the manuscript (see examples below).
authors can deal with my comments by some additional data analyses and by downplaying and
specifying of some of their statements.
We thank the reviewer for this positive comment and for all constrictive suggestions which
have notably improved the quality of our work.
Specific comments
1) Consider a change of the title to emphasize that this is a field study. For example:
“Repeatability of circadian behavioral variation revealed in free ranging marine fish.”
We agree with the reviewer and we have changed the title. Thanks for the suggestion!
2) L.: 19-20 Awkward sentence, please simplify.
Revised (see lines 18-19).
3) L.: 25-27 I couldn’t understand the sentence before I read the manuscript, please
reformulate and specify for which environmental factor you controlled.
Revised (see lines 24-27).
4) L.: 29-30 See my comments in summary regarding the usage of the term “personality-
related chronotype”.
The term “personality-related chronotype” has been removed according to a general comment
this reviewer and a comment made by reviwer#1.
5) L: 50-52 and 57-58 There are already some studies in fishes showing in consentient inter-
individual differences in behavior related to circadian cycles (see my comments in the
summary).
Regarding this comment, see the second response to this reviewer. Our work is essentially
different from those cited by the reviewer as we study repeatability on behavior and we
consider circadian behavior other than activity or swimming speed (e.g. awaking time) in
accordance to the definition of chronotype.
6) L: 90 Please provide coordinates of the study area.
Coordinates have been included (see line 99).
7) L: 92 Provide details about the fish mass and tag weigh.
Details provided (see line 102).
8) L: 120 – 121 Is it possible that individual emerged from the send and then hide in again
during a short intervals around the sunrise and sunset? I have no expertise with the behavior
of the model species, but I can imagine such a behavior as animals can sample their
environment before they definitely decide to emerge from or hide to a shelter. If that was the
case, authors could get some bias in estimation of awaking time compare to the rest onset as
the first A bin could be followed by A-R transition but the last A bin cannot be followed by A-R
transition.
Regarding this comments , see response to reviwer#1 about behavioural validation.
Considering that awakening time in this species ranges from -16 to 480 min to the sunrise
(with a mean and s.d. of 117.9 ± 85.1 min) (see 231-232 and Table S1), 5 min provides enough
resolution for testing our hypothesis. We feel that we have properly addressed this concern.
9) L: 154-155: Specify whether you used fish id as a random intercept or also as a random
slope to some fixed factor.
Id of the fish was considered as random intercept (revised for clarity, see line 180).
10) L: 218 “We therefore discarded the existence of a circadian-related behavioural syndrome”
is rather strong general statement for which you really don’t have support in your results,
consider downplaying (specifying) or removing it.
We agree with the reviewer and the statement has been removed.
11) L: 225 – 226 Could you suggest some explanation of the difference in awakening time and
rest duration between the years?
Year differences can be caused by many factors. We prefer do not speculate about the effect
of year in the manuscript, and only highlight that the covariate year is important when
exploring repeatability of circadian behaviors. Some cause of the year effect could be due to
different variables that co-vary with year such as temperature, abundance, presence of
predators or other potential variable co-varying with year.
12) 231-233 Awkward sentence please reformulate.
Sentence revised for clarity (see line 333).
13) L: 249 – 254 See my comments regarding pseudo-repeatability in the summary.
We feel that we have properly addressed this concern (see general responses to this reviewer).
14) L: 291 – 293 I don’t see how the studies you refer to support your statement regarding the
fishing selection since they are all focus on birds. Please reformulate the sentence or provide
some more relevant references.
We have widely edited this part for clarity and included a reference in fish (see lines 332-348)
We would like to thank for these useful and detailed comments made by the reviewers and
the associate editor and hope you find our manuscript as improved as we do.
We are looking forward to your final decision.

Dear Editor,
We are very grateful for the comments and suggestions provided by you and the two
reviewers related to the revised version of our manuscript entitled “Repeatability of
circadian behavioral variation revealed in free ranging marine fish (Manuscript ID
label_version_3
RSOS-160791R1)”. Please find attached a second revised version and a response to
reviewers.
All comments made by the reviewers have been addressed in this second revised
version (minor changes). Below you can find the list of the comments made by both
reviewers followed by our responses and the changes made in the manuscript. The
manuscript has been strongly improved after all the revision process, for which we are
very grateful.

Comments to the Author(s)
This field-based study provides evidence for the existence of repeatable circadian and non-
circadian behavioral phenotypes in pearly razorfish. The authors state that these behaviors do
not covary at the between-individual level, and largely do not covary at the within-individual
level (except between awakening time and traveled distance) and thus represent independent
repeatable traits rather than forming a behavioral syndrome. The authors provide a revised
version of their manuscript and I commend them for successfully addressing most of the
previous comments on their paper. Although I am satisfied with how the authors have
addressed my previous concerns, I have a few additional minor comments on the revised
manuscript that I detail below. Additionally, I suggest that the authors do not refer to their
treatment of confounding variables (lat/long, sex, size, etc.) as a testing procedure. They were
included initially as confounding variables (not hypotheses to be tested) were submitted to DIC
model-selection (which, for example, selected models that did not include sex, and therefore
the final, used, model did not 'test' sex (you could state that models not including sex were
more parsimonious than with sex, but you shouldn't say it tested non-significant)) and a single
model was chosen. Subsequently, when a model-selection approach is followed p-values
should not be presented if independent data sets were not used for the selection and model-
fitting steps (parameter estimation), and they are uncorrected for the multiple-testing
situation of model selection and do not account for uncertainty in selecting a single model. In
this case, without independent data sets to perform model selection then estimation, I suggest
that the authors simply delete the p-mcmc values in table 1 and focus on the estimates and
95% BCIs (which they already do).
We agree with the reviewer and we have deleted the p-mcmc values (and their
interpretations) from the manuscript for clarity (see specific responses below). We thank the
reviewer for all of constructive comments made in our manuscript.
(N=14 fish) as estimates of between-individual (co)variance will be associated with much
greater uncertainty than estimates of within-individual (co)variance (n=max14 repeats per fish)
and is a likely reason why few between-individual correlations were considered significant,
even with strong estimates (e.g. onset and awakening correlation = 0.57 strong but not
significant)
We agree with the reviewer about this comment and we have edited the discussion to
highlight even more this limitation according the comment of the reviewer (see lines 287-290,
291-311 and 322-341).
I believe these points can easily be incorporated into the manuscript.
Minor comments:
line 75: technically, this isn't a hypothesis. Rephrase to something like:
“fish harbor consistent between-individual differences in mean circadian behavioral
phenotypes across contexts.”
Then your prediction would be something like:
If there is consistent behavioral differentiation in circadian phenotypes of fish then individuals'
ranking in a behavioral assay will remain the same when measured in multiple contexts. (or
statistically, the proportion of between-individual variance will be significantly larger than the
total variance)
We agree with the reviewer we have edited this part of the introduction according the
reviewer suggestions (see lines 73-83).
line 76: this "test"ing could represent several additional hypotheses- 1 for each variable that
you've investigated in your lmms. Alternatively, literature suggests that they are confounding
variables, so you include them because they should be controlled for, but you are not
interested in testing them as hypotheses.
I would suggest that you outline the study to 'test' 2 things: repeatability of phenotypes
(controlling for influential variables), and integration of circadian phenotypes with other
personality traits or independently as a circadian phenotype syndrome. Don't 'test' your
confounding variables, just include them because there is evidence that they influence the
behavior.
According with these comments by the reviewer, we have outlined the study to 'test' two
things for clarity: (c) Repeatability of circadian behavioural variation and (d) Between-
individual correlations among circadian behaviours and activity (see M&M).We have removed
all references to “testing confounding variables” for clarity as the main objective was using
them as co-variates rather than testing their effects.
line 96: put the sample size
The sample has been included (see line 95).
line 162: I would like to see a biological justification (if there is one) for the selection of sex
versus size as the variable chosen to include here- e.g. are sex-dependent physiological
differences in circadian regulation stronger than size-dependent circadian differences? I expect
there is more previous evidence for sex-specific differences
We selected sex because there is more evidence for sexual differences in other taxa [refs 10
and 15] and induce a better discussion of our results. We have included this biological
justification in the ms (see line 169). Moreover, as the pearly razorfish is a protogynious
hermaphrodite, fish size variable was formed by a bi-modal (females and males) distribution
which make complex the analysis. This issue is solved considering the categorical variable sex.
Anyway, the variance explained by sex or fish size in our work is irrelevant and their effect
produce any change to our findings.
line 171: I suggest to remove 'significant effects were discussed jointly' as I do not agree that
you should attribute the effect of latitude/longitude with grain size or depth without directly
testing it if you later argue that latitude and longitude also represent any number of
unmeasured variables. Its fine however, to speculate on the likely implications for grain size or
depth in the discussion. Similarly, if you choose to include lat/long instead of biologically
relevant measures, you should not present this part as hypothesis-testing, rather (as you write
later) you include whatever variables you have than might influence behavior, regardless of
their interpretation, for 'better' estimates of adjusted repeatability.
About this comment, see the response to the reviewer #2 (We have included the results
considering grain size or depth for clarity).
line 219: delete 'recommended', and maybe exchange 'uninformative' with 'weak';
Dingemanse & Dochtermann don't give recommendations for priors. Additionally, what you've
used was an inverse-Wishart prior (inverse gamma is a special case of inverse wishart for
univariate models only; multivariate models will be inverse-wishart (see Hadfield MCMCglmm
Course Notes)). Your specification of V=1 is also typical of univariate models. In bivariate
models you would specify the identity matrix V=diag(2) (as in Dingemanse & Dochtermann
[37]) such that the variances would equal 1 and covariances equal 0; you've coded both
variance and covariance to equal 1. As long as your data are not very sensitive to the priors,
this shouldn't change your results much.
'recommended' has been removed and 'uninformative' has been changed to 'weak' according
to the reviewer comment. Regarding the second point, we agree with the reviewer and prior
structure was not well explained (our fault). We used inverse-wishart as mentioned by the
reviewer, and we already used V=diag(2) or an identity matrix of size 2 (as our model is
multivariate). We have edited the text for clarity (see line 220).
line 260: replace (and decreasing the grainsize of the habitat) with (which is negatively
correlated with grain size of habitat)
Replaced
line 278: replace 'shallower water' with 'higher longitudes'
Replaced
line 282: because your final model did not include 'sex' as a variable, you didn't actually 'test'
the effect of sex on behaviors and subsequently, shouldn't say that you didn't find a
relationship between sex and behavior. Furthermore, if you don't test the effect of sex, then
you shouldn't speculate so much about relationships that you could have, but didn't test.
Sex was included in the full model, but their effect was not retained after the optimization of
the LMMS. Thus, we explicitly not tested the effect of sex as the reviewer mentioned. We
clarified the text according to the comment “We didn’t find a significant proportion of variance
explained by sex and this factor was not retained in the final LMMs.” (lines 284-290).
Statistically speaking however, this means that the effects of sex was not significant. But we
agree with the reviewer and we have clarified this issue (lines 284-290).
line 294: some researchers suggest that for more accurate estimates of repeatability when
repeatability is low one should increase repeated-measures, while when repeatability is high,
one should increase the number of individuals sampled. We see in your results table very large
uncertainty in estimates of between-individual variation and particularly the between-
individual correlations (because you've only sampled 14 individuals) and relatively less
would suggest that you highlight the issue of small between-individual sample size down
around line 325 (limitations) as you've estimated some relatively strong bivariate covariances
that are probably only non-significant because there is so much uncertainty when you have
such a small sample size. Even with high repeatability (~0.8) Dingemanse & Dochtermann's
[37] simulations suggest at least 25 individuals be used.
We agree and we have highlighted more the issue of small between-individual sample size (see
edited lines 287-290, 291-311 and 322-341). Also see the second response to this reviewer
regarding this issue.
line 334: 'Fish balance...' start a new paragraph here.
Done
Table 1: I did not find the term p-mcmc in reference [36] from line 181. I am unfamiliar with it,
but I might guess that its the percentage of MCMC iterations that are on the opposite side of
zero from the posterior mean, and correspond somewhat to a frequentist p-value. However,
once you've done model selection with DIC, similar to AIC, you should not present significance
testing p-values of parameters because this is a problem of uncorrected multiple testing and
doesn't account for uncertainty in model selection. Otherwise, you should use a separate
dataset for model selection versus estimation if you had more data. I would suggest to remove
p-values and focus on your parameter estimates with their 95%BCI, then you could put
somewhere that you consider any estimates who's 95%BCI do not overlap zero to be
'significant'.
We agree with the reviewer. P-mcmc values have been removed according to the first
comment made by this reviewer and BCI were only used. The text has been edited for clarity
(see e.g Line 186 and Table 1).
Table S1: clarify that (n) number of days of tracking is after removing days because of
abnormal behavior after tagging. Remove 'circadian-related' from final sentence.
Clarified and removed (Table S1)
Reviwer#2
Authors have done a good job in addressing my comments and agree the clarity of manuscript
has improved. I have only minor comment regarding the context of repeatability
measurements. Authors have decided to stick with their original intention to control
repeatability for the context of latitude and longitude of individual's home range center
instead for water depth and habitat type (i.e. grain size) as suggested by reviewer 1 and me. I
agree that these two habitat factors were closely correlated to lat and lon as authors
demonstrated in convincing figure S1. However, I still think that authors didn't fully explain
why they used the geographical position instead of the direct data on habitat quality. I suggest
authors to provide results of the alternative analyses (i.e. controlling for depth and bottom
grain size) as supplementary material, and to specify which are the "variables not sampled that
co-varied spatially" with lat and lon in the main text of the manuscript. This should clarify their
decision and provide valuable information for future research.
We have included the results of the alternative analyses (i.e., controlling for depth and bottom
grain size) in the supplementary material (see supplementary material, Table S2). Note how
the results are essentially the same than those provided in Table 1 (i.e., all estimates are
similar and the CI clearly overlap). In fact, CIs are a bit larger when considering habitat
variables. Thus, using one set of variables (spatial) or other (habitat), the conclusion is the
same according to our argument provided in the manuscript (somewhat expected considering
the high degree of co-linearity of both of variables). But now, all results are included in the
constrictive comments made to our manuscript.
We would like to thank for these useful and detailed comments made by the reviewers
and the associate editor and hope you find our manuscript as improved as we do.
We are looking forward to your final decision.
