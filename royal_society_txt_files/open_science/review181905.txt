This paper reports three crystal forms of sophoricoside which have not been previously reported.
These are characterised by various techniques including single crystal X-ray diffraction. While
there is no doubt that the qualitative structures are correct two of the structure determinations are
not of the quality that I would expect of a modern experiment. It is quite clear that there are
problems with both A & C. For example the R(int) values are 0.15 and 0.12. This is the R value for
averaging equivalent reflections and for small organic molecules such as those reported here
would typically be 0.03-0.05. Conventional R values (related to the quality of the model refined)
for these compounds are also unacceptably high for a modern experiment on a small organic
molecule. Poor data leads to a lack of precision in the metric parameters. The authors should re-
measure there data on better quality samples.
There is also a fundamental problem with the author’s discussion. For many years there was
considerable confusion in the polymorphism literature over what constituted a polymorph as
some authors referred to solvates, hydrates and sometimes even salts as being polymophs of a
parent compound. Thankfully today it is accepted universally that a polymorph is crystalline
sample with the same chemical composition. The incorporation of solvent leads to new crystal
forms but NOT new polymorphs. The authors confusion over new crystal forms (referred to
sometimes in their manuscript) vs polymorphs (referred to frequently in their manuscript) is
unhelpful. The manuscript should be redrafted removing any mention of polymorphism. A
model paper that authors’ might consult over distinguishing between polymorphs vs solvates vs
hydrates is:-
Complex polymorphic system of gallic acid – five mononhydrates, three anhydrates and over 20
solvates.
D.E. Braun et. Al., Cryst. Grth. & Design., (2013), 13, 19-23.
To perpetuate the confusion over what constitutes a polymorph is not acceptable and the paper
should not be published until it is modified to report new crystal forms rather than polymorphs.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
In this manuscript, the authors have reported novel solid-state forms of the active pharmaceutical
ingredient, Sophoricoside, two solvates, a non-solvate and an amorphous form. All the solids
were thoroughly characterized by techniques such as X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectroscopy, and
thermal analysis. Crystal structure of the crystalline samples was determined.
In general, I am happy with the authors’ responses to the previous reviewers. However, there are
still some instances where the authors’ should have been clearer in what they would like to
report. Therefore, I recommend a further revision of this manuscript before it is considered for
publication.
6
1. Solvatomorphism was defined in the introduction appropriately. However, in all the remaining
sections, the authors have once again used the same term for referring to ‘solvatomorphs’ or
‘solvates’. I recommend authors to choose either one of these two terms to address Forms B and C
consistently.
2. I agree with the Referee 1 that the R(int) values of the solvates is significantly higher than the
acceptable values. However, the fact that characterization of the samples by other analytical
techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis confirms their purity. I am not
too concerned about the crystal data that were reported along with this manuscript, however, I
would like to strongly advise the authors to improve the data by other means. For example, the
disordered solvent molecule could be embedded in the structure model by PLATON-SQUEEZE
which could help to improve crystal structure parameters.
3. Time-solubility profiles reported in Figure 8 are interesting. The stability analysis of the forms
B-D suggests that they transform to Form A under certain experimental conditions. Hence, I
would expect the solubility profiles of forms B-D to follow spring-and-parachute model.
However, high supersaturation levels of sophoricoside were maintained even at 240 min. I was
wondering whether the authors could repeat these experiments to show the reproducibility and
provide error bars for the solubility profiles.
4. Noted that the authors have not conducted stability of the solid forms in slurry. I would
recommend these experiments to complement the results showed in Figure 8. Are the forms B-D
stable in slurry for 24 hours?
5. Page 8, line 28, ‘worst’ is not the correct word to use. Recommend using ‘lowest’ instead.
6. Page 9, line 8, I think the authors wanted to refer to Form D (not A).

The revisions provided for the reviewer's comments are satisfactory. Few minor changes are
suggested before the acceptance.
1. Last two sentences in the summary are repetitive. "Amorphous phase and solvatomorphism
were unstable but can improve the solubility of sophoricoside in water. Amorphous phase and
solvatomorphism are unstable but have good
solubility relative to solvent-free form." Please revise.
2. "Form A could remain stable at high temperature, high humidity, and strong light experiments
for 10 d" What happens to Form A after 10 days?
3. Conclusion - There is a typo in the sentence ".The solubility results showed that amorphous
phase and solvatomorphism of sophoricoside can obviously improve the solubility, especially the
percentage of dissolution of the form A was approximately 3 times that of form A." This should
be revised as ...dissolution of the form D was approximately 3 times that of form A.

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
This article describes a study of some solid forms of the compound sophoricoside. The
scientific context is the study of pharmaceutically-relevant solid forms, which attracts
significant attention in the chemical and pharmaceutical literature and is of practical
importance in the industry. The Introduction describes the context appropriately.
In this area, the work that has been carried out is limited: the compound has been
crystallised from three different solvent systems, and the three crystalline products have
been characterised by single-crystal and powder XRD, plus DSC/TGA and FT-IR. The
characterisation of the products is adequate and competent, but the study (as it is
described) is not a comprehensive "solid-form screen" and there is no significant creative
element. The resulting paper is largely a crystallographic report.
In relation to the objective criteria of RSOS, I question whether this paper "sufficiently
advances scientific knowledge" and whether it "exhaustively analyses all the relevant
scientific/methodological issues". I believe that it does not meet these selection criteria and
hence I do not think it is appropriate for the journal. If it is considered by the Editor to be
appropriate, it would require some modification as outlined below.
(1) The authors should consider more carefully the use of the words "polymorph" and
"solvate". In the academic literature, it is universally accepted that polymorphs are different
crystalline forms of the same chemical compound. The three compounds reported here all
have different chemical composition. Hence, sophoricoside is not actually shown to be
polymorphic. The results show one crystal structure for sophoricoside, plus the existence of
two solvates. The lack of consistency and clarity in these definitions leads to a generally
misleading description of the results.
(2) For a journal that embraces open data principles, I would hope that crystallographic
reports would prioritise electronic formats (CIF) and limit reproduction of the technical
information in formatted journal articles. For example: Tables 1 and 2 in this article are not
necessary. I would encourage the authors to deposit their crystallographic data (as they have
done), then focus on “adding value” in the scientific description. There is no longer any need
to list the technical details of a crystal-structure determination.
(3) In Section 4.2, the authors note that the PXRD patterns are sufficiently different to enable
the forms to be "distinguished in a mixture of the three forms". Under what experimental
circumstances is it likely to produce a mixture of these three forms? The statement about
distinguishing solid forms can be very relevant for genuine polymorphs, which may be
produced when a single chemical compound is crystallised, but it is not so relevant for these
different chemical compounds. This may seem like a trivial criticism, but it is indicative of the
paper as a whole. The discussion confuses ideas that are genuinely relevant to
polymorphism with the situation that actually exists here.
(4) Regarding the crystallographic data: all of the structure refinements look to be
scientifically sound. In all three structures, however, the coordinates place the molecules
outside of the unit cell, which is not helpful for structure visualisation. I would encourage the
authors to shift the coordinates so that the molecules are inside of the unit cell.
(5) The crystal structure of the pyridine/water solvate is interesting. The description in this
paper does not adequately make this clear. There is a feeling in the community that high Z'
forms of this type are usually kinetic forms, which are likely to transform to more stable
forms having higher symmetry. So I am surprised to see that this is the outcome after 12
days of stirring. This system warrants further experimentation, and it is another
disappointing aspect of the paper that the authors haven't commented on it or realised that
it might be interesting to follow up. Is this crystalline form really stable to stirring for 12
days? What happens if the solvent composition is changed? Can the solvate be created by
liquid assisted grinding (LAG), which is more likely to produce thermodynamic forms? We
could argue that a pyridine solvate is unlikely to be pharmaceutically-relevant, so it should
not be a practical priority to investigate it further. But since the authors have made it, they
could do more to characterise the system in the hope that it will contribute to the general
understanding of the nature of solvates of pharmaceutically-relevant molecules.

Dear Editor William King MRSC and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments and
suggestions concerning our manuscript entitled “New Crystal Forms
and Amorphous Phase of Sophoricoside: X-Ray Structures and
Characterization”. Those comments are important for revising and
improving our paper. Based on these comments and suggestions, we
have thoughtfully taken into account these comments and made careful
modifications to the original manuscript. We hope the new manuscript
will meet your magazine’s standard. The point-by-point responses to
the referees’ comments or questions are as follows, the original
comments are in blue, and our responses are in black.
For Reviewer 1:
First of all, thanks for your advices.
1. Comment: This paper reports three crystal forms of
sophoricoside which have not been previously reported. These are
characterised by various techniques including single crystal X-ray
diffraction. While there is no doubt that the qualitative structures are
correct two of the structure determinations are not of the quality that I
would expect of a modern experiment. It is quite clear that there are
problems with both A & C. For example the R(int) values are 0.15 and
0.12. This is the R value for averaging equivalent reflections and for
small organic molecules such as those reported here would typically be
0.03-0.05. Conventional R values (related to the quality of the model
refined) for these compounds are also unacceptably high for a modern
experiment on a small organic molecule. Poor data leads to a lack of
precision in the metric parameters. The authors should re-measure
there data on better quality samples.
Response: We accept the comment, considering the reviewer’s
suggestion, the explanation was added in the new manuscript and
described as followed:
The R (int) values of form A & C are 0.15 and 0.12. R (int) is
the R value for averaging equivalent reflections and for small organic
molecules such as those reported here would typically be 0.03-0.05.
The unacceptably high for Flack parameters and R (int) values of form
A & C attributed to poor crystallographic data. In order to obtain better
quality samples for re-measuring crystallographic data, the
researchers culture single crystal for many times. But the crystals were
too small, and the crystals were easily changed in the air for a long
time, the best data is presented in this article.
2. Comment: There is also a fundamental problem with the
author’s discussion. For many years there was considerable confusion
in the polymorphism literature over what constituted a polymorph as
some authors referred to solvates, hydrates and sometimes even salts
as being polymophs of a parent compound. Thankfully today it is
accepted universally that a polymorph is crystalline sample with the
same chemical composition. The incorporation of solvent leads to new
crystal forms but NOT new polymorphs. The authors confusion over
new crystal forms (referred to sometimes in their manuscript) vs
polymorphs (referred to frequently in their manuscript) is unhelpful.
The manuscript should be redrafted removing any mention of
polymorphism.
Response: We accept the comment, considering the reviewer’s
suggestion, we made careful modifications to the whole manuscript
and removed any mention of polymorphism.
For Reviewer 2:
First of all, thanks for your advices.
1. Comment: The authors should consider more carefully the use
of the words "polymorph" and "solvate". In the academic literature, it

lack of consistency and clarity in these definitions leads to a generally

the technical details of a crystal-structure determination.
Response: We accept the comment, considering the reviewer’s
suggestion, we removed Tables 2, Tables 3 and some technical details
of a crystal-structure determination of original manuscript.
3. Comment: In Section 4.2, the authors note that the PXRD
patterns are sufficiently different to enable the forms to be
"distinguished in a mixture of the three forms". Under what
experimental circumstances is it likely to produce a mixture of these
three forms? The statement about distinguishing solid forms can be

confuses ideas that are genuinely relevant to polymorphism with the

Response: We accept the comment, considering the reviewer’s
suggestion, the description of Section 4.2 was checked and modified.
4. Comment: Regarding the crystallographic data: all of the

structures, however, the coordinates place the molecules outside of the

pyridine solvate is unlikely to be pharmaceutically-relevant, so it
should not be a practical priority to investigate it further. But since the
authors have made it, they could do more to characterise the system in
the hope that it will contribute to the general understanding of the
nature of solvates of pharmaceutically-relevant molecules.
Response: In fact, form C was prepared by completely dissolving
sophoricoside in a mixture of pyridine and water (20:1, v/v), the
saturated solutions were allowed to stand for crystallization at 25°C
for about 12 d. We only succeeded in obtaining the single crystals
suitable for SXRD of pyridine/water solvate from the solutions by the
slow evaporation. The entire recrystallization process did not involve stirring
experiment.
We accept the comment, considering the reviewer’s liquid
assisted grinding (LAG) suggestion. We tried to get pyridine/water
solvate through liquid assisted grinding (LAG), but only got form A,
mixture of form A and form B. Unable to get pyridine/water solvate
through liquid assisted grinding (LAG).
We hope that all these changes fulfill the requirements to make
the manuscript acceptable for publication in RSOS.
Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Sincerely yours,
First author Cheng Xing on behalf of the authors.

Appendix C
Dear Dr Laura Smith and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments and
suggestions concerning our manuscript entitled “New Crystal Forms
and Amorphous Phase of Sophoricoside: X-Ray Structures and
Characterization”. Those comments are important for revising and
improving our paper. Based on these comments and suggestions, we
have thoughtfully taken into account these comments and made careful
modifications to the manuscript. We hope the new manuscript will
meet your magazine’s standard. The point-by-point responses to the
referees’ comments or questions are as follows, the original comments
are in blue, and our responses are in black.
For Reviewer 3:
First of all, thanks for your advices.
1. Comment: Solvatomorphism was defined in the introduction
appropriately. However, in all the remaining sections, the authors have
once again used the same term for referring to ‘solvatomorphs’ or
‘solvates’. I recommend authors to choose either one of these two
terms to address Forms B and C consistently.
Response: We accept the comment, considering the reviewer’s
suggestion, we used solvatomorphs to consistently address Forms B
and C. Please see the manuscript for details.
2. Comment: I agree with the Referee 1 that the R(int) values of
the solvates is significantly higher than the acceptable values.
However, the fact that characterization of the samples by other
analytical techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction and thermal
analysis confirms their purity. I am not too concerned about the crystal
data that were reported along with this manuscript, however, I would
like to strongly advise the authors to improve the data by other means.
For example, the disordered solvent molecule could be embedded in
the structure model by PLATON-SQUEEZE which could help to
improve crystal structure parameters.
Response: First of all, I would like to thank the teacher for the
affirmation of the manuscript. We have tried a variety of methods to
improve crystal structure parameters, including processing form C
with PLATON-SQUEEZE, but with little effect. In order to obtain
better quality samples for re-measuring crystallographic data, the
researchers culture single crystal for many times. But the crystals were
too small, and the crystals were easily changed in the air for a long
time, the best data is presented in this article.
3. Comment: Time-solubility profiles reported in Figure 8 are
interesting. The stability analysis of the forms B-D suggests that they
transform to Form A under certain experimental conditions. Hence, I
would expect the solubility profiles of forms B-D to follow
spring-and-parachute model. However, high supersaturation levels of
sophoricoside were maintained even at 240 min. I was wondering
whether the authors could repeat these experiments to show the
reproducibility and provide error bars for the solubility profiles.
Response: We accept the comment, considering the reviewer’s
suggestion, we repeated these experiments and provided error bars for
the solubility profiles. Please see the manuscript for details in Figure 8.
4. Comment: Noted that the authors have not conducted stability
of the solid forms in slurry. I would recommend these experiments to
complement the results showed in Figure 8. Are the forms B-D stable
in slurry for 24 hours?
Response: We accept the comment, considering the reviewer’s
suggestion, we investigated the stability of stirring of four solid forms
in water. Form A could remain stable in slurry for 24 hours, but forms
B and C were unstable in slurry and transformed to form A for about
12 hours, forms D were unstable in slurry and completely transformed
to form A for 8 hours.
5. Comment: Page 8, line 28, ‘worst’ is not the correct word to
use. Recommend using ‘lowest’ instead.
Response: We accept the comment, considering the reviewer’s
suggestion, we made careful modifications to the manuscript: “From
the SXRD results, the crystal density value of form A was higher than
those of forms B and C, so the solubility of form A is the lowest.”
6. Comment: Page 9, line 8, I think the authors wanted to refer to
Form D (not A).
Response: We accept the comment, considering the reviewer’s
suggestion, we made careful modifications to the manuscript: “The
solubility results showed that amorphous phase and solvatomorphism
of sophoricoside can obviously improve the solubility, especially the
percentage of dissolution of the form D was approximately 3 times
that of form A.”
For Reviewer 4:
First of all, thanks for your advices.
1. Comment: Last two sentences in the summary are repetitive.
"Amorphous phase and solvatomorphism were unstable but can
improve the solubility of sophoricoside in water. Amorphous phase
and solvatomorphism are unstable but have good solubility relative to
solvent-free form." Please revise.
Response: We accept the comment, considering the reviewer’s
suggestion, we made careful modifications to the manuscript and
removed “Amorphous phase and solvatomorphism are unstable but
have good solubility relative to solvent-free form.any mention of
polymorphism”.
2. Comment: "Form A could remain stable at high temperature,
high humidity, and strong light experiments for 10 d" What happens to
Form A after 10 days?
Response: We accept the comment, considering the reviewer’s
suggestion, we found form A could remain stable at high temperature,
high humidity, and strong light experiments for at least 30 days.
3. Comment: Conclusion - There is a typo in the sentence ".The
solubility results showed that amorphous phase and solvatomorphism
of sophoricoside can obviously improve the solubility, especially the
percentage of dissolution of the form A was approximately 3 times that
of form A." This should be revised as ...dissolution of the form D was
approximately 3 times that of form A.
Response: We accept the comment, considering the reviewer’s
suggestion, we made careful modifications to the manuscript: “The
solubility results showed that amorphous phase and solvatomorphism
of sophoricoside can obviously improve the solubility, especially the
percentage of dissolution of the form D was approximately 3 times
that of form A.”
We hope that all these changes fulfill the requirements to make
the manuscript acceptable for publication in RSOS.
Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Sincerely yours,
First author Cheng Xing on behalf of the authors.
