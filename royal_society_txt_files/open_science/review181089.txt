As climate related data are used to an increasing degree in modeling and predicting future
climate change, depending on primarily an increase of greenhouse gases emitted to the
atmosphere, a proper statistical data analysis is of paramount importance. Scientific results, in
addition to informed interpretations, guide policy makers and provide a basis for societal
decisions. This paper describes how the use of different statistical methods can give quite
different results, showing trends of variable slopes, and points at the importance of being
transparent in which method is being used and what it implies. This is important for the
confidence in the conclusions made, and subsequently in the political (or other) decisions taken.
The authors have developed a statistical method which seems to be more accurate than those
commonly used, and thus should be of great significance for future studies. The new method also
seems to be generally applicable, not only to climate related data, but to many other kinds of
problems (e.g. biological), where there are unequally (or randomly) spaced observations in
temporal or spatially distributed data sets.
While the statistical analysis appears to be correct and thoroughly worked out, the title of the
paper is perhaps a bit misleading. The paper is more methodological than applied, and the
climate related data used, is taken as an example and illustration to the differences between the
statistical methods used. The authors should consider to change the title of the paper, to reflect
this fact more than what the current title implies. Alternatively, that the paper is organized in
another way, where the problems with trends in climatic data is initially more emphasized.

How real are observed trends in small correlated datasets?

Mathematical Sciences,

Sciences

In this paper a new correlation estimate based on the Durbin-Watson statistic is developed,
leading to an improved estimate of autoregression with highly correlated data, thus reducing this
risk. These techniques are generalised to randomly located data points in space, through the new
concept of the nearest new neighbour path. The authors describe tests on the validity of the GLS
schemes, allowing verification of the models employed.
Although the paper could furnish a good contribution to the existing literature, however some
significant aspects must be clarified and improved; without these specific requirements the paper
cannot be accepted for publication. In particular:
1) It is not specified throughout the paper what are the theoretical hypotheses to apply the new
correlation estimate, neither are specifed the practical aspects outcoming for applying this new
estimate. The above discussion concerns equally spaced data points in one dimensional space.
2) It is not clear how to apply the GLS estimate in a multi-dimensional space. Moreover and most
importantly, what is its usefulness in this context? The authors suggest to replace a first order
autoregressive model with its equivalent exponential model: however, this is very restrictive.
Indeed, geostatistical literature provides several tools and better solutions in this context; for
example, anisotropy aspects are not considered by the authors, moreover spatial correlation is
well captured by the variogram and several models exist to describe the spatial (or, more
generally, spatio-temporal ) correlation.
3) At least in the spatial context, literature must be updated.
Then, in the present form the paper cannot be accepted. A major revisioni is required.

Review of ‘How real are observed climate trends?’
by S. J. Salamon, H. J. Hansen and D. Abbott
ain focus of this manuscript is the assessment of the significance of a trend in a time
es when the series is assumed to be the sum of two components: a trend that can be
ressed as a linear combination of explanatory variables (with one parameter for each
able) and normally distributed errors that obey a first-order autoregressive (AR(1))
cess with an autocorrelation structure dictated by an additional parameter <U+03C1>. If <U+03C1>
e known in this setup, its value could be used to estimate the trend parameters using
eralized least squares (GLS), and the resulting estimated trend would be optimal in a
ain minimum variance sense. If <U+03C1> is unknown, optimality can be recovered by using a
ximum likelihood (ML) procedure to jointly estimate <U+03C1> and the trend parameters. This
roach is well known and is addressed in standard textbooks on time series analysis
er the subject of regression with stationary errors – see, for example, Section 6.6.2
ntroduction to Time Series and Forecasting (Third Edition) by P. J. Brockwell and
A. Davis, Springer, 2016, or Section 3.8 of Time Series Analysis and Its Applications:
h R Examples (Fourth Edition) by R. H. Shumway and D. S. Stoffer, Springer, 2017.
her than using this standard approach to address the question posed by the title of the
nuscript, the manuscript ignores it almost completely (item [5] in the detailed comments
ow explains the qualifier ‘almost’). Instead the manuscript considers a procedure in
ch ordinary least squares (OLS) is used to estimate the trend parameters, and the
duals from the fitted model are used to estimate <U+03C1>. This estimate in turn is then used
eestimate the trend parameters. The need to use an estimate for <U+03C1> causes estimates
he trend parameters to be suboptimal. With particular emphasis on the case where
is close to unity, the authors put forth methodology evidently intended to overcome
-optimality. Whereas the standard approach falls out from well-established statistical
ciples (ML estimation), the approach advocated in this manuscript is ad hoc in nature
the detailed comments below). In addition, the standard approach has flexibility in
choice of a model for the errors, whereas the approach advocated here is based on the
n – but not always – reasonable contention that an AR(1) process is a good choice for
deling correlated errors (or a well-known extension to this process for unequally spaced
e series or for spatial data). The standard approach also advocates a careful study of
residuals from the final model to confirm its reasonableness, the lack of which in the
rent manuscript is a serious flaw. The lack of any serious comparison of the proposed
ad hoc methodology with the optimal standard approach is another serious flaw.
Here are some detailed comments (listed roughly in the order in which the issues arise
le reading through the manuscript).
The exposition surrounding Equation (2.1) employs the standard distinction in the
statistical literature between errors (unobservable terms in a model) and residuals
(observable terms resulting from fitting a model). This distinction is blurred elsewhere
in the paper. Even if errors are assumed to be uncorrelated, residuals from least
squares fits are not. This fact is discussed in standard references on regression analysis
(e.g., Applied Linear Regression (Fourth Edition) by S. Weisberg, Wiley, 2014), but it
follows readily from the fact the sum of least squares residuals must be zero. The first
sentence in Section (b) says ‘. . . if the residuals are correlated, a better estimator may
1
be found’, but the statement applies to errors, not residuals (there are other instances
in the manuscript where a similar clarification is needed).
While an AR(1) model is often adequate for modeling noise in climate time series, its
structure for dependence is short range in the sense of exhibiting exponential decay
as the time between variates increases. Models encapsulating long-range dependence
(hyperbolic as opposed to exponential decay) have been gaining in popularity. As
formulated using a fractional difference process or fractional Gaussian noise, these
models are as simple as an AR(1) model in the sense of having the same number of
unknown parameters (two). A good entrance into the literature that discusses the
relative merits of models with short- and long-range dependence is the article ‘Recon-
structing Past Temperatures from Natural Proxies and Estimated Climate Forcings
using Short- and Long-Memory Models’ by Barboza et al., Annals of Applied Statistics,
Vol. 8, No. 4, 2014, pp. 1966–2001. As noted previously, the current manuscript only
delves into AR(1) noise, which is too restrictive to provide an authoritative answer to
the sweeping question posed in the title of the manuscript.
In the expression for rk in Equation (2.2), ‘i = 2’ should be ‘i = 1’ to get the standard
expression for the sample ACF.
The final sentence in the paragraph containing Equation (2.9) doesn’t make sense
to me – given that OLS is easier to implement than GLS, wouldn’t the criterion of
simplicity suggest OLS to be a preferred approach over GLS?
In the next paragraph, the Cochrane–Olcutt method is briefly discussed, but nothing
more is done with it in the rest of the paper. Both Brockwell & Davis and Shumway
& Stoffer discuss the role that the Cochrane–Olcutt method can play in obtaining the
optimal joint ML estimates of <U+03C1> and the trend parameters. This is the only indication
in the manuscript of an awareness of the optimal standard approach.
I fail to see why the failure of the error bars in Figure 1 to overlap ‘only a few years
either side of the measured data’ tells us much about the standard errors deduced
for slope and curvature, as suggested toward the end of Section 2(d). I also fail to
see why the greater degree of overlap in Figure 4 in any way validates the ad hoc
approach advocated in this manuscript. Trend is an inherently ill-defined concept
that only becomes well defined with an assumption about the nature of the trend. I
see no reason why the assumptions of linear and quadratic trends should lead to trend
extrapolations that agree with one another.
I fail to see why requiring the t-test for the regression slope to obey a t-distribution
with N - k degrees of freedom should be regarded as a fundamental requirement (here
k = 1 for a linear trend, while k = 2 for a quadratic trend). There are two additional
parameters (<U+03C1> and an intercept parameter) for a total of k + 2 parameters. In view of
the optimal standard approach, is there any relevant statistical theory suggesting that
a t-distribution with N - k degrees of freedom is relevant for assessing the significance
of an optimally estimated slope parameter? Without supporting statistical theory
and without direct comparison to the optimal estimator, the empirically determined
estimator <U+03C1>^ of Equation (3.2) is of questionable value.
In Figure 3, are stationary initial conditions used to initiate the simulation of AR(1)
noise? Use of such conditions is important to use for values of <U+03C1> close to unity.
2
In the discussion following Equation (4.2), it is not clear to me why inversion of the
matrix X0 S-1 X is regarded as a likely problem. The dimension of this matrix is
(k + 1) × (k + 1), which is quite small when k is either 1 or 2, as is assumed throughout
the manuscript.
There is a substantial literature on using the semivariogram to estimate model pa-
rameters, none of which is mentioned in the current manuscript. Two references that
come to mind are Interpolation of Spatial Data by M. L. Stein, Springer–Verlag, 1999,
and Geostatistics: Modeling Spatial Uncertainty (Second Edition) by J.-P. Chile`s and
P. Delfiner, Wiley, 2012 (use of these with a citation index should lead to current
thinking on semivariogram-based estimators).

Title: "How real are observed climate trends?"

Author: Salamon et al.
To: Alice Power, Editorial Coordinator
Dear Alice,
Re: Reply to reviewers on MS # RSOS-171493
Many thanks for having our paper RSOS-171493 reviewed.
We have pleasure in attaching an updated manuscript and our point-by-point response
to the comments is given below.
Best regards,
Stephen Salamon et al.
Reviewer#1: As climate related data are used to an increasing degree in modeling and
predicting future climate change, depending on primarily an increase of greenhouse
gases emitted to the atmosphere, a proper statistical data analysis is of paramount
importance. Scientific results, in addition to informed interpretations, guide policy
makers and provide a basis for societal decisions. This paper describes how the use of
different statistical methods can give quite different results, showing trends of variable
slopes, and points at the importance of being transparent in which method is being
used and what it implies. This is important for the confidence in the conclusions made,
and subsequently in the political (or other) decisions taken. The authors have
developed a statistical method which seems to be more accurate than those commonly
used, and thus should be of great significance for future studies. The new method also
seems to be generally applicable, not only to climate related data, but to many other
kinds of problems (e.g. biological), where there are unequally (or randomly) spaced
observations in temporal or spatially distributed data sets.
While the statistical analysis appears to be correct and thoroughly worked out, the title
of the paper is perhaps a bit misleading. The paper is more methodological than
applied, and the climate related data used, is taken as an example and illustration to
the differences between the statistical methods used. The authors should consider to
change the title of the paper, to reflect this fact more than what the current title
implies. Alternatively, that the paper is organized in another way, where the problems
with trends in climatic data is initially more emphasized.
Author reply: We thank the reviewer for these comments. We agree a different title
would better reflect the nature of the paper. We also agree the method has more
general applications.
Author action: We have changed the title of the paper to “How real are observed trends
in small correlated datasets?” To emphasize generality, we have added the following to
the abstract: “The method is generally applicable, not only to climate related data, but
to many other kinds of problems (eg. biological and medical data), where there are
unequally (or randomly) spaced observations in temporal or spatially distributed data
sets.”
________________________________________
Reviewer#2: A main focus of this manuscript is the assessment of the significance of a
trend in a time series when the series is assumed to be the sum of two components: a
trend that can be expressed as a linear combination of explanatory variables (with one
parameter for each variable) and normally distributed errors that obey a first-order
autoregressive (AR(1)) process with an autocorrelation structure dictated by an
additional parameter <U+03C1>. If <U+03C1> were known in this setup, its value could be used to
estimate the trend parameters using generalized least squares (GLS), and the resulting
estimated trend would be optimal in a
certain minimum variance sense. If <U+03C1> is unknown, optimality can be recovered by using
a maximum likelihood (ML) procedure to jointly estimate <U+03C1> and the trend parameters.
This approach is well known and is addressed in standard textbooks on time series
analysis under the subject of regression with stationary errors – see, for example,
Section 6.6.2 of Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting (Third Edition) by P. J.
Brockwell and R. A. Davis, Springer, 2016, or Section 3.8 of Time Series Analysis and
Its Applications:
With R Examples (Fourth Edition) by R. H. Shumway and D. S. Stoffer, Springer, 2017.
Rather than using this standard approach to address the question posed by the title of
the manuscript, the manuscript ignores it almost completely (item [5] in the detailed
comments below explains the qualifier `almost'). Instead the manuscript considers a
procedure in which ordinary least squares (OLS) is used to estimate the trend
parameters, and the residuals from the fitted model are used to estimate <U+03C1>. This
estimate in turn is then used to re-estimate the trend parameters. The need to use an
estimate for <U+03C1> causes estimates of the trend parameters to be suboptimal. With
particular emphasis on the case where |<U+03C1>| is close to unity, the authors put forth
methodology evidently intended to overcome sub-optimality. Whereas the standard
approach falls out from well-established statistical principles (ML estimation), the
approach advocated in this manuscript is ad hoc in nature (see the detailed comments
below).
Author reply: We thank the reviewer for a most detailed examination of the
methodology of this paper. We agree that maximum likelihood (ML) estimation should
have been discussed in the paper. While ML is rightly considered optimal in the
asymptotic sense, we would point out that ML estimation is not always unbiased, a
potential problem when estimating <U+03C1> values close to unity. It is perhaps surprising that
in all our testing with both simulated and real data, the results with iterated joint ML
estimation of <U+03C1> and ß, were almost indistinguishable from the far simpler technique
described in the original manuscript, estimating <U+03C1> as 1 – d/2, where d is the Durbin-
Watson statistic from the OLS residuals; that is, without any iteration!
We agree that the new model estimating of <U+03C1> in the original paper was ad-hoc, so we
have now replaced it with an improved method.
Author action: We now include ML estimation in our background section 2 and include
joint ML estimation of <U+03C1> and ß alongside other techniques in all testing of equally-
spaced time-series data in the paper. We have replaced the ad-hoc modified Durbin-
Watson statistic of the original manuscript by a new estimate of <U+03C1>, this time based on
the exact expressions published by Durbin and Watson for the expected value and
variance of d for the null hypothesis case. We show that this new estimate has much
lower bias than ML estimation for small datasets and <U+03C1> approaching unity, while
achieving similar variance.

Reviewer#2: In addition, the standard approach has flexibility in the choice of a model
for the errors, whereas the approach advocated here is based on the often – but not
always – reasonable contention that an AR(1) process is a good choice for modeling
correlated errors (or a well-known extension to this process for unequally spaced time
series or for spatial data). The standard approach also advocates a careful study of the
residuals from the final model to confirm its reasonableness, the lack of which in the
current manuscript is a serious flaw. The lack of any serious comparison of the
proposed the ad hoc methodology with the optimal standard approach is another
serious flaw.
Author reply: We agree that choice in the model for the errors is desirable, particularly
in large datasets. However, our focus is on small positively correlated datasets, where
we generally find flexibility in the choice of the model for the response is generally a
more important issue, and this flexibility is not restricted in any way by our
methodology. However, we now describe testing of the transformed GLS residuals, so
that suitability of the AR(1) or exponential process may be tested. Where this testing
fails despite trying different models for the response, different types of models may
need to be considered for the error correlation, but that is beyond the scope of this
paper. We provide the tools for the reader to recognize that situation.
Author action: A detailed description of a Durbin-Watson test on transformed GLS
residuals, including calculation of the associated confidence interval, is now provided in
section 2(f).
________________________________________
Reviewer#2 [1]: The exposition surrounding Equation (2.1) employs the standard
distinction in the statistical literature between errors (unobservable terms in a model)
and residuals (observable terms resulting from fitting a model). This distinction is
blurred elsewhere in the paper. Even if errors are assumed to be uncorrelated,
residuals from least squares fits are not. This fact is discussed in standard references
on regression analysis (e.g., Applied Linear Regression (Fourth Edition) by S. Weisberg,
Wiley, 2014), but it follows readily from the fact the sum of least squares residuals
must be zero. The first sentence in Section (b) says `… if the residuals are correlated, a
better estimator may 1 be found', but the statement applies to errors, not residuals
(there are other instances in the manuscript where a similar clarification is needed).
Author reply: We agree that the important distinction between errors and residuals,
especially important for small sample sizes, was not sufficiently clear in the original
manuscript.
Author action: The text in section 2(b) referred to above has now been changed to read
“If the residuals are correlated, this suggests correlation between the errors, although
the two are not the same, as bOLS is only an estimate of ß. If the errors are correlated,
a better estimator may be found, if a reasonable model for this correlation is available”.

Reviewer#2 [2]: While an AR(1) model is often adequate for modeling noise in climate
time series, its structure for dependence is short range in the sense of exhibiting
exponential decay as the time between variates increases. Models encapsulating long-
range dependence (hyperbolic as opposed to exponential decay) have been gaining in
popularity. As formulated using a fractional difference process or fractional Gaussian
noise, these models are as simple as an AR(1) model in the sense of having the same
number of unknown parameters (two). A good entrance into the literature that
discusses the relative merits of models with short- and long-range dependence is the
article `Reconstructing Past Temperatures from Natural Proxies and Estimated Climate
Forcings using Short- and Long-Memory Models' by Barboza et al., Annals of Applied
Statistics, Vol. 8, No. 4, 2014, pp. 1966–2001. As noted previously, the current
manuscript only delves into AR(1) noise, which is too restrictive to provide an
authoritative answer to the sweeping question posed in the title of the manuscript.
Author reply: We agree that the sweeping question posed in the title tends to
misrepresent the true nature of this paper. Our main focus is the difficult problem of
analyzing trends in relatively small and potentially highly positively correlated datasets.
While including models with long-range dependence would have made the paper more
general, for the sake of simplicity we only considered exponential decay models, as
most relevant to small datasets. We have generalized the techniques described in
terms of the number of dimensions of space where the observations are made, and
whether they are uniformly or randomly located in that space, and even described how
to deal with cases where some observations are co-located. However, long-range
dependence is beyond the scope of this present study, as it is less likely to be
encountered in small datasets.
Author action: Testing of the transformed GLS residuals is now described, so that
suitability of the AR(1) or exponential process that we use may be tested. We have
changed the title of the paper to “How real are observed trends in small correlated
datasets?” to clarify the scope of the paper.

Reviewer#2 [3]: In the expression for rk in Equation (2.2), `i = 2' should be `i = 1' to
get the standard expression for the sample ACF.
Author reply: We agree and thank the reviewer for noticing this typographic error in
(2.2). This error was only in the text, not the computer code used in the analysis.
Author action: The typographic error has been corrected.
________________________________________
Reviewer#2 [4]: The final sentence in the paragraph containing Equation (2.9) doesn't
make sense to me – given that OLS is easier to implement than GLS, wouldn't the
criterion of simplicity suggest OLS to be a preferred approach over GLS?
Author reply: Although simple scaling of OLS results appears to be an effective method
of correcting the t-statistic according to <U+03C1>, it does not correct the estimated bOLS
model according to <U+03C1>, while GLS does. The scaled OLS technique does not provide any
way of testing that the assumed AR(1) model is appropriate. We now include a
description of that testing for GLS estimation in 2(f).
Author action: We have replaced this sentence with: “A weakness of the schemes of
(2.14) and (2.15) [the scaled OLS approach] are that they do not allow for testing of
the correctness of the error correlation model, as described in section (f) above.”
________________________________________
Reviewer#2 [5]: To In the next paragraph, the Cochrane–Olcutt method is briefly
discussed, but nothing more is done with it in the rest of the paper. Both Brockwell &
Davis and Shumway & Stoffer discuss the role that the Cochrane–Olcutt method can
play in obtaining the optimal joint ML estimates of <U+03C1> and the trend parameters. This is
the only indication in the manuscript of an awareness of the optimal standard
approach.
Author reply: The Cochrane–Orcutt method was our initial focus in this research, given
that for equally spaced time-series data with AR(1) noise of known <U+03C1>, Cochrane–Orcutt
exactly removes the correlation in the errors. This comes with the disadvantage of the
loss of one data point, which may be significant for small data-sets, which is the
particular focus of this paper. This disadvantage may be overcome by Prais-Winsten
estimation, which we did not mention, because it is essentially equivalent to GLS
estimation, as described in our paper, and as implemented in R, and GLS is both a
more familiar standard method, and more readily generalized to unevenly spaced data
in multiple dimensions. We should have mentioned ML estimation – we have now
corrected that oversight.
Author action: We now have a new sub-section 2(e) “Maximum likelihood estimation,”
where we describe a practical approach to this, based on Brockwell & Davis and
Shumway & Stoffer, which we have successfully tested and found to be very stable. We
use Shumway & Stoffer’s estimate of <U+03C1> conditioned on the first error term, together
with the Brockwell & Davis iterative scheme to converge on the joint ML estimate.
Interestingly, this ML method gives strikingly similar results to our far simpler use of
the Durbin-Watson statistic to estimate <U+03C1>, as 1 – d/2, described in our original
manuscript.

Reviewer#2 [6]: I fail to see why the failure of the error bars in Figure 1 to overlap
`only a few years either side of the measured data' tells us much about the standard
errors deduced for slope and curvature, as suggested toward the end of Section 2(d). I
also fail to see why the greater degree of overlap in Figure 4 in any way validates the
ad hoc approach advocated in this manuscript. Trend is an inherently ill-defined
concept that only becomes well defined with an assumption about the nature of the
trend. I see no reason why the assumptions of linear and quadratic trends should lead
to trend extrapolations that agree with one another.
Author reply: We agree that this part of the original manuscript was not well explained.
Mathematically there is no reason to expect the error bars for extrapolations of
alternative models to overlap, but we have now clarified this in terms of prediction
intervals, as defined in texts such as Probability & Statistics for Engineers & Scientists
by Walpole, Myers, Myers, and Ye (9th ed., Prentice Hall). In practice, regression
models may be called on to provide an estimate in a region where no data is available,
and no acceptable physical model is available either. Our radio climate modelling
example of sub-section 5(c) is an example of this. While such extrapolations may be
undesirable, they are sometimes unavoidable, and it would be desirable in such
circumstances that estimated confidence intervals from alternative models overlap the
unknown real values – impossible if those intervals have no overlap with each-other.
This was the reason for our statement that failure of the error bars to overlap beyond
the available data casts doubt on the certainty implied by high t-values.
Author action: We now include a new section 2(i), “The prediction interval - supervised
machine learning,” which defines the prediction interval for GLS regression, and
discusses with the example of figure 2, how it may be used for forecasting.
________________________________________
Reviewer#2 [7]: I fail to see why requiring the t-test for the regression slope to obey a
t-distribution with N – k degrees of freedom should be regarded as a fundamental
requirement (here k = 1 for a linear trend, while k = 2 for a quadratic trend). There are
two additional parameters (<U+03C1> and an intercept parameter) for a total of k +2
parameters. In view of the optimal standard approach, is there any relevant statistical
theory suggesting that a t-distribution with N – k degrees of freedom is relevant for
assessing the significance of an optimally estimated slope parameter? Without
supporting statistical theory and without direct comparison to the optimal estimator,
the empirically determined estimator <U+03C1> of Equation (3.2) is of questionable value.
Author reply: If the null hypothesis is that no real trend exists, it is fundamentally
important that in Monte-Carlo testing of cases of correlated noise with no real trend,
the conventionally evaluated “t-statistic” for the regression parameters should follow
some known distribution. It would be convenient if this could approximate the t-
distribution with N – k – 1 degrees of freedom, as it is known to be when <U+03C1> is known.
Theoretically, the distribution of estimated ß parameters changes from a t-distribution
with N–k–1 degrees of freedom to something a different when we replace known <U+03C1> with
an estimate of <U+03C1>, and it is not simply a t-distribution with N–k–2 degrees of freedom.
Identifying what this distribution should be for the more successful techniques
described to estimate <U+03C1> may be intractable. Instead, we take the practical approach of
assuming a t-distribution with N – k – 1 degrees of freedom for the ß parameters and
concentrate on finding a way of estimating of t that reasonably approximates this.
Author action: No action taken.
________________________________________
Reviewer#2 [8]: In Figure 3, are stationary initial conditions used to initiate the
simulation of AR(1) noise? Use of such conditions is important to use for values of <U+03C1>
close to unity.
Author reply: We agree – this is very important, and we should have mentioned it. Yes,
stationary initial conditions were used. The initial random value was matched in mean
and standard deviation to the long-term values of the AR(1) noise.
Author action: We have now included in the caption of this figure (now figure 5) a
description of the initial conditions used to ensure stationarity.
________________________________________
Reviewer#2 [9]: In the discussion following Equation (4.2), it is not clear to me why
inversion of the matrix X’S-1X is regarded as a likely problem. The dimension of this
matrix is (k+1) x (k+1), which is quite small when k is either 1 or 2, as is assumed
throughout the manuscript.
Author reply: We agree that it will not be a problem for the simple examples in the
original manuscript where k is small, but the manuscript does not assume that the
methods are restricted to such small k values; perhaps that was not made clear.
Naturally we tested the method with many more variables to ensure stability and
general usefulness, and in this testing we occasionally had problems inverting X’S-1X.
In our ISAP 2016 paper we have 9 explanatory variables, and in some cases tested
with this data, X’S-1X was found to be close to singular when estimated r0 was large,
while for the same problem inversion of X’X as required for OLS was straightforward.
Author action: We amend “A more likely problem is inversion of (X’S-1X), so the
availability of a GLS estimate for a particular type of model is not necessarily
guaranteed, particularly if the residual correlation is high” to read “If k is large and
correlation is considerable, an occasional problem is inversion of (X’S-1X), so the
availability of a GLS estimate for a particular type of model is not necessarily
guaranteed.” We have revised the final example of 5(c) to discuss the 9 variable ISAP
2016 model, to clarify that the methods are not restricted to just one or two
explanatory variables.
________________________________________
Reviewer#2 [10]: There is a substantial literature on using the semivariogram to
estimate model parameters, none of which is mentioned in the current manuscript. Two
references that come to mind are Interpolation of Spatial Data by M. L. Stein,
Springer–Verlag, 1999, and Geostatistics: Modeling Spatial Uncertainty (Second
Edition) by J.-P. Chiles and P. Delfiner, Wiley, 2012 (use of these with a citation index
should lead to current thinking on semivariogram-based estimators).
Author reply: We agree. Due to the prior experience of the prime author with kriging,
many of our initial attempts to solve this problem naturally used a semivariogram
approach. While some reasonable results were obtained, our aim was to find a
consistent approach that could be applied uniformly to data in one-, two- and three-
dimensional space. We found our extension of the Durbin-Watson statistic to random
spacing and multi-dimensional space to be preferable if the requirement is a uniform
approach for all these cases.
Author action: All testing of spatially distributed data in sections 4 and 5 now includes
semivariogram estimation alongside our proposed Durbin-Watson based methods.
Appendix C
Manuscript ID: RSOS-171493
Type: Regular
Title: "How real are observed trends in small correlated datasets?"
Author: Salamon et al.
To: Andrew Dunn, Royal Society Open Science Editorial Office
Dear Andrew,
Re: Reply to reviewers on MS # RSOS-181089
Many thanks for having our paper RSOS-181089 reviewed.
We have pleasure in attaching an updated manuscript and our point-by-point response to
the comments is given below.
Best regards,
Stephen Salamon et al.
Reviewer#1: The authors have considered my comments satisfactory and changed the title
accordingly.
Author reply: We thank the reviewer for the confirmation that the new title is suitable.
Reviewer#3, 1): In this paper a new correlation estimate based on the Durbin-Watson
statistic is developed, leading to an improved estimate of autoregression with highly
correlated data, thus reducing this risk. These techniques are generalised to randomly
located data points in space, through the new concept of the nearest new neighbour path.
The authors describe tests on the validity of the GLS schemes, allowing verification of the
models employed.
Although the paper could furnish a good contribution to the existing literature, however
some significant aspects must be clarified and improved; without these specific
requirements the paper cannot be accepted for publication. In particular:
1) It is not specified throughout the paper what are the theoretical hypotheses to apply
the new correlation estimate, neither are specified the practical aspects outcoming for
applying this new estimate. The above discussion concerns equally spaced data points in
one dimensional space.
Author reply: In the case of equally spaced data points in one dimensional space, we use
the well-known Durbin-Watson statistic, and in particular refer to its published theoretical
study of its statistical distribution. We provide a new estimate of rho for the first-order
autoregressive model and show from published theory that our new estimate will be
unbiased for the rho=0 case. Admittedly our tanh adjustment scheme to produce an
estimate for other cases is rather more empirical. This was found to be necessary because
the literature-based alternative of the beta distribution was found to be numerically
impractical for many cases well removed from rho=0. In contrast, our tanh alternative in
(3.1) is numerically practical for all cases we have tried, and we show by Monte Carlo
testing, e.g. figure 4, that our new estimate has considerably lower bias than other
estimates such as MLE, the lag-1 value of the ACF, or the simple Durbin-Watson estimate
rho = 1 - d/2. Despite the reduced bias of our new estimate, it has a similar size confidence
interval to that of MLE.
Author action: To clarify our equation (3.1) we have amended the end of the last sentence
before it, to read "... and expectation E(d) and variance V(d) for the uncorrelated case,
from (2.6):"
Reviewer#3, 2): It is not clear how to apply the GLS estimate in a multi-dimensional space.
Moreover and most importantly, what is its usefulness in this context? The authors suggest
to replace a first order autoregressive model with its equivalent exponential model:
however, this is very restrictive. Indeed, geostatistical literature provides several tools and
better solutions in this context; for example, anisotropy aspects are not considered by the
authors, moreover spatial correlation is well captured by the variogram and several models
exist to describe the spatial (or, more generally, spatio-temporal) correlation.
Author reply: We agree that in describing the development our GLS estimate in a multi-
dimensional space, we do not have a clear enough statement of the application of the
method. We address this by adding a new sub-section 4(e) "Summary of the proposed GLS,
for data in multiple dimensions." This describes the proposed procedure. We agree that
confining the discussion to an isotropic exponential model is restrictive, but as this method
is a generalisation of the Durbin-Watson statistic, it essentially only caters for a single
parameter model. Just as the first-order autoregressive model is likely to be the most
appropriate single parameter model to estimate from the Durbin-Watson statistic, the
well-known, and valid in any number of dimensions, exponential model is likely to be the
most appropriate single parameter model to estimate from our nearest new neighbour
path definition of sum or squares of residual forward differences. We have not included
anisotropy as part of our new model, but now discuss it in the new sub-section 4(e), as well
as short- and long-range dependence, and how to identify if alternative models, other than
our simple isotropic exponential one, need to be considered.
Author action: We have added a new sub-section 4(e) "Summary of the proposed GLS, for
data in multiple dimensions." This describes the proposed method, including testing for
validity of the exponential model. The assumptions of our proposed method are discussed,
including the possibility of anisotropy.
Reviewer#3, 3): At least in the spatial context, literature must be updated.
Author reply: We agree that the paper did not provide adequate guidance alternatives to
the isotropic exponential models discussed, or how to identify if those alternatives needed
to be explored.
Author action: The new sub-section 4(e) describing the proposed new procedure includes
discussion of testing that may be performed, to identify if alternate models or procedures
may be required. This includes references to recent literature on spatial statistics and
anisotropy.
