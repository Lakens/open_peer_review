I read carefully the revision of the manuscript entitled “Neutral genetic variation in adult
Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) shows effects on a somatic trade-off and
morphological laterality” by Wiper and colleagues.
I found the manuscript improved with respect to the previous comments. There is only one point
that I think should be explicitly stated in the text. The authors now clearly explained the origin of
their fish lines. It should however be reported that: the lines used in the study might different for
genetic factors other than variability, being breed separately and from different founder
individuals; thus, the study provides only an indication of the effects of inbreeding which should
be investigated in the future with a controlled design. This statement can be inserted in
discussion, for example in the conclusions.
Accordingly, change the abstract:
L24-26: state that the fish derive from pre-existing lines selected for growing and so on but not for
inbreeding level.
L30-32: remove “well-controlled”.
Other details that require authors’ attention:
L82-83: change “there is likely” in “there might be”.
L248: remove “marginal but not significant as improper”; I think the authors want to indicate that
the effect “is close to the threshold for statistical significance”.
L255-257: Discuss that the effect seems be due mainly to the Low group.

Associate Editor's comments:
Two reviewers have favorably commented on this manuscripts. However, both reviewers also
point out that the authors need to be more forthcoming about the limitations of the study design
and discuss the results in the context of alternative hypotheses. I agree with this notion and
believe that these issues can easily be addressed during the revision of the paper.

This is an interesting and ground-breaking study on genetic influences on brain structure in
salmon. The authors improved the manuscript significantly by adding brain to the title and by
modifying the Discussion and Conclusions to acknowledge the preliminary nature of some of the
conclusions. However, some minor changes are still needed. The appropriate verb in the title
should be affects rather than effects. Neutral genetic variation may influence rather than "bring
about" the changes. The authors did not modify their abstract at all and it should be modified

and softened to correspond with the revised Discussion and Conclusions. Supplemental data on
body size is not thought relevant by the authors but anyone who wants to reconstruct and
understand the experiment in detail likely would appreciate it; I encourage the authors to
provide this as supplemental data.

Appendix A
The manuscript by Wiper et al. studies several brain and body measures in four
groups of farmed Chinook salmon. These include the brain size to body ratio and
brain “laterality”, the degree to which the two sides (left and right) of two regions of
the brain differ in size. The general hypothesis being tested was that inbreeding
(based on comparing the four groups of Chinook salmon) might affect brain/body
size ratio and brain laterality and to test for these effects. Reviewer comments were
also available for consideration; the authors appeared to often disagree with the
reviewer comments. Their general conclusion for brain/ body ratio was that it
decreased with inbreeding. However, laterality was decreased for the cerebellum
with inbreeding, the opposite of the expected direction.
The general topic was interesting and related to a number of previous studies of
asymmetry and inbreeding effects in fishes. However, I did not come away strongly
convinced by conclusions of the study; other explanations seemed equally plausible.
As one reviewer pointed out, very little background information about the four
groups was provided (including after the initial review) and the differences seen
might very well reflect genetic differences among the groups, rather than inbreeding
per se. It would be helpful to have access to the raw data as supplemental tables.
For example, how big were the fish being studied and did this differ among groups?
I do believe that incorporating “brain” into the title would be helpful because of its
centrality to the study. The authors comment that aquaculture fish tend to be highly
inbred, but this is not uniformly true and may be a risky generalization. The
microsatellite data appeared sound and supported the groupings that the authors
made about relative inbreeding levels.
Shortening the paper and softening the conclusions could strengthen it. It is an
interesting study on a little-investigated topic and the results might help set the
stage for future studies.

mments to the Author(s)
ad carefully the revision of the manuscript entitled “Neutral genetic variation in adult
nook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) shows effects on a somatic trade-off and
rphological laterality” by Wiper and colleagues.
und the manuscript improved with respect to the previous comments. There is only one point
I think should be explicitly stated in the text. The authors now clearly explained the origin of
r fish lines. It should however be reported that: the lines used in the study might different for
etic factors other than variability, being breed separately and from different founder
ividuals; thus, the study provides only an indication of the effects of inbreeding which should
nvestigated in the future with a controlled design. This statement can be inserted in
cussion, for example in the conclusions.
thors’ Response: We agree with the reviewer that wording needs to be changed to better
ect that the fish from whom fin clips were collected were representatives of each line,
those whose brains were measured. Additionally, we agree that conclusions need to be
orked to better reflect that we are only indicating potential relationships between
reeding and our dependent variables; we were not directly testing inbreeding. To that
, clarifying statements have been added throughout the discussion and conclusion and
explicitly call for future studies using controlled breeding experiments (lines 266-267,
-280, 290-291, 305-306, 331, 333-341, 350-353).
cordingly, change the abstract:
-26: state that the fish derive from pre-existing lines selected for growing and so on but not
inbreeding level.
thor’s Response: In the ‘Methods’ where we discuss our ‘study species’ we already state
t the stock fish from the hatchery, the HHxHH and LLxLL performance lines, “were
ated from fish chosen for high or low performance based on gene markers related to
wth and survival” (lines 105-108), thus we have chosen to add the suggested clarifying
ormation that these lines were not selected for, or created to test, inbreeding effects at
s 109 – 110 rather than the abstract.
-32: remove “well-controlled”.
thors’ Response: The term “well-controlled” has been removed from the abstract (at
31).
er details that require authors’ attention:
-83: change “there is likely” in “there might be”.
thors’ Response: “There is likely” has been changed to “there might be”, at line 82.
8: remove “marginal but not significant as improper”; I think the authors want to indicate
the effect “is close to the threshold for statistical significance”.
thors’ Response: Taking into account the suggestion from the reviewer, the wording
ut the significance of the result in question has been changed to be more clear (lines
-249).
5-257: Discuss that the effect seems be due mainly to the Low group.
thors’ Response: A comment has been added at lines 258-259 and 302-303 to point out
Low inbreeding level group seems to be driving the effects we are seeing on our
rality measures.

rtening the paper and softening the conclusions could strengthen it. It is an interesting study
a little-investigated topic and the results might help set the stage for future studies.
thors’ Response: We appreciate the comments and suggestions from the reviewer and
e addressed major points in turn below:
<U+F0B7> One of the first points brought up the reviewer was also presented by our first
reviewer. Specifically, that differences we are seeing may not be due to inbreeding
per se but to other genetic differences among the groups studied. This issue has been
addressed with the addition of lines to qualify that there may be other genetic effects
for which we did not account (see lines 277-280; 333-336).
<U+F0B7> As per the submission instructions of Royal Society Open Science, the raw data files
were submitted to Dryad and all raw data, including absolute brain and body mass
are available for inspection. Including body weight information as supplemental
tables would, we feel, be extraneous to the Dryad submission. Our focus was not on
absolute body mass differences between groups, but on the investment into the brain
as compared to the body. With using our brain-to-body ratio measure (brain
mass/body mass) we have accounted and controlled for group variation in body size.
<U+F0B7> We have incorporated the term “brain” into the title (lines 1-2) to make the title
more relevant to the information that the paper is presenting.
<U+F0B7> A very fair point was made about the wording at line 286 of our comment on
aquaculture fish tending to be inbred. The wording has been softened where we
have suggested the high inbreeding of aquaculture fish.
<U+F0B7> In line with the suggestions of the first reviewer, here it was suggested that we soften
our conclusions as, in some places, they may be a bit too bold. Thus, conclusions
have been reworked to better reflect that we are not testing true inbreeding effects
but instead we are able to conclude on the potential relationships between the
variables measured and that future studies using controlled breeding designs will be
necessary to make more firm statements about the effect of inbreeding in the case of
brain-to-body trade-offs and morphological laterality. Clarifying statements have
been added throughout the discussion and conclusion at lines 266-267, 277-280, 290-
291, 305-306, 331, 333-341, 350-353.

s is an interesting and ground-breaking study on genetic influences on brain structure in
mon. The authors improved the manuscript significantly by adding brain to the title and by
difying the Discussion and Conclusions to acknowledge the preliminary nature of some of the
clusions. However, some minor changes are still needed. The appropriate verb in the title
uld be affects rather than effects. Neutral genetic variation may influence rather than "bring
ut" the changes. The authors did not modify their abstract at all and it should be modified
softened to correspond with the revised Discussion and Conclusions. Supplemental data on
y size is not thought relevant by the authors but anyone who wants to reconstruct and
erstand the experiment in detail likely would appreciate it; I encourage the authors to provide
as supplemental data.
thors’ response: We have made the suggested changes. Specifically, in the title (line 1),
verb “effects” has been changed to “affects”. The wording in the abstract has been
tened to reflect the speculative nature of the research results presented by the
nuscript. These changes can be found at lines 21-23, 28, 29-33, and 35. As to the
iewer’s suggestion for the inclusion of body size data, it is not that we found the
lusion of body size data irrelevant but that body size (both length and mass) of all fish
ose brains were measured has already been included in the raw data file submitted to
yad, hence our lack of inclusion of this information in a supplemental table. As we have
eady communicated, the dryad submission should address this comment adequately
rhaps the reviewer did not have access to these data at the review stage). Therefore the
plemental information already exists.
