The papers reviews how Infrared thermography is used in biology. The paper is a good
introduction for good practices when using infrared thermography. It also contains guidelines for
an adequate application. In this area, the paper could be improved by providing a better
description of the required steps to perform accurate measurements under different conditions,
animals or plants. In the paper, the term “infrared light” is used. However, the term light usually
refers to visible light. Therefore, it is better to use infrared radiation rather than infrared light. The
explanation about the IR bands could also be improved. The IR band goes from 0.8 to 14um.
However, MWIR (2-5um) and LWIR (8-14um) are the most commonly used in IRT. A review of
the emissivity values used for similar applications could also be extremely valuable to support
the conclusions of the authors.

Nice idea to check wether all the data presented in thermography articles allow repetitvness of
the study. I really would like to see this tables I put as comment 23 in my review, and would like
to see exclusion criteria - if it is possible - better sistematized.

Manuscript Changes and Author Responses
RESPONSE TO REFEREE 1
Reviewer 1 made to following comments in the manuscript decision email:
“The papers reviews how Infrared thermography is used in biology. The paper is a
good introduction for good practices when using infrared thermography. It also
contains guidelines for an adequate application. In this area, the paper could be
improved by providing a better description of the required steps to perform accurate
measurements under different conditions, animals or plants. In the paper, the term
“infrared light” is used. However, the term light usually refers to visible light.
Therefore, it is better to use infrared radiation rather than infrared light. The
explanation about the IR bands could also be improved. The IR band goes from 0.8 to
14um. However, MWIR (2-5um) and LWIR (8-14um) are the most commonly used in
IRT. A review of the emissivity values used for similar applications could also be
extremely valuable to support the conclusions of the authors.”
The following changes have been made based on the advice of reviewer 1’s
comments:
“the paper could be improved by providing a better description of the required steps
to perform accurate measurements under different conditions, animals or plants.”
We have made to following edits that clarify the provide more advice on
thermography protocol and have expanded on how best practices apply to
different kinds of biological studies. However, we feel it inappropriate to
generalize too much about best procedures on studies involving animals and
plants, as the circumstances of a particular study can vary greatly despite
similar study organisms.
Page 28: We have added table 1 to the manuscript. This provides a checklist
for protocol of measurements and highlights when such measurements
should be done within the procedure. It also adds information on camera
operation. Table 1 is now made reference to in the main text at page 7 lines
140 to 141, page 10 line 215 and page 11 line 242.
Page 7 lines 131 to 143: “The best quality…[until the end of paragraph]”. This
paragraph has been expanded to clarify how necessity of correct parameter
inputs influence the process of carrying out thermography.
Page 8 lines 162 to 163: Further advice on emissivity measurements added.
Page 10 lines 202 to 205: Notes on the practical procedure of tref
measurements with a mirror given “Practically speaking … [to] the initial
image”
Page 10 lines 212 to 215: “Reflected temperature…[until the end of
paragraph]” Clarification of when reflected temperature should be measured
is added.
Page 10 and 11 lines 221 to 228: “This can be easier…[until the end of
paragraph]”, This section is expanded to better account for how the nature of
the target influences the most practical reflected temperature protocol.
Page 11 lines 241 to 242: Sentence beginning “To maximize…”, clarification on
timing of when environmental parameters ought to be measured has been
added.
“The explanation about the IR bands could also be improved. The IR band goes from
0.8 to 14um. However, MWIR (2-5um) and LWIR (8-14um) are the most commonly
used in IRT.”
Further detail has been added to the explanation of IR bands cameras are
sensitive to (page 5 lines 86 to 91).
“In the paper, the term “infrared light” is used. However, the term light usually refers
to visible light. Therefore, it is better to use infrared radiation rather than infrared
light.”
The use of ‘infrared light’ was a deliberate choice by the authors when initially
explaining the concepts of radiation and reflection. The terms “infrared
radiation” and “thermal radiation” are used through most of the manuscript.
We felt pointing out the similarity between visible and infrared
electromagnetic radiation is helpful to understand the necessity to account
for parameters, particularly reflections.
We have edited the manuscript to include the more conventional terms. We
feel the chosen edits help maintain the explanation from the original
manuscript but uses more conventional language.
Page 3 line 40: “…light radiated by all objects…” replaced by “radiation from
all objects”
Page 3 line 45: “infrared light” substituted for “infrared radiation”
Page 4 line 77: manuscript now reads “All objects of a temperature above
absolute zero emit electromagnetic radiation.” The following section then
describes how this is normally in the IR band as before.
Page 5 line 102: “A thermal camera detects light, electromagnetic waves in
the thermal IR band,” now reads “A thermal camera detects electromagnetic
waves in the thermal IR band,” the following similarities between human-
visible light and infrared radiation are maintained as they help explain the
need to account for reflections.
“A review of the emissivity values used for similar applications could also be
extremely valuable to support the conclusions of the authors.”
A table documenting the mean, minimum and maximum and standard
deviation of emissivity values used on similar targets, based on thermography
targets, has been constructed and included within table 6 (page 32). We make
several references to this table in the main text where relevant on page 20
line 454 and page 25 line 570.
RESPONSE TO REFEREE 2
Reviewer 2 made to following comments in the manuscript decision email:
“Nice idea to check wether all the data presented in thermography articles allow
repetitvness of the study. I really would like to see this tables I put as comment 23 in
my review, and would like to see exclusion criteria – if it is possible – better
sistematized.”
Review 2 also provided itemised points on their comments in a document attached
to the decision letter email. The following are the itemised comments from this
attached document (using the numbers of that document) and the corresponding
edits made in response:
1. “Summary” change to “Abstract”
Changed exactly as advised - now page 2, line 17.
2. Pg. 2 line 24: word study change to review.
Changed exactly as advised - now page 2, line 25.
3. Pg. 2 lines 25-27: Instead of “This is done through a systematic review of
biological thermography literature published between 2007 and 2017.“ put:
“A systematic review of biological thermography literature included articles
published between years 2007 and 2017.”
Sentence now reads “This is done through a systematic review of
biological thermography literature that included articles
published between years 2007 and 2017 .” As we feel this
adjustment of the suggested edit works better with the
preceding and following sentences- now page 2, line 25-27.
4. Pg. 2 line 31: “This finding highlights the need for life scientists to take care
to into account for and report key parameter information when carrying out
thermography, in the future.”
Changed exactly as advised - now page 2, line 31-33.
5. Pg. 3 line 48: …..are taken place: such as…....................
Changed exactly as advised - now page 3, line 47.
6. Pg. 8 line 169: delete space before full stop.
Changed exactly as advised - now page 9, line 184.
7. Pg. 9 line 174: Reflected temperature can also be referred to as …..
The original language was correct, and we have not made this
change. – now page 9 line 189.
8. Pg. 10 line 194: ……….. temperature value still has the to be entered…………
Changed exactly as advised - now page 10, line 211.
9. Pg. 10 line 212, 213: It is journal paper, thus sentences beginning with
symbols – no – rewrite them please.
Sentences are now altered to not begin with camera parameter
symbols. These two sentences now start with the parameter full
name – now page 11 line 235 and 237 read as “Transmissivity of
the atmosphere, <U+0001D70F><U+0001D44E><U+0001D461><U+0001D45A> , accounts for how well that radiation
travels through the air between the camera and target.
Transmissivity of the atmosphere is normally estimated by the
camera using…”
10. Pg. 11 line 231: “Emissivity estimates estimated from the same kinds of
tissue can vary [43, 49], which means that the chosen emissivity value
chosen will have a drastic impact on the accuracy of thermographic
measurements.”
Changed exactly as advised - now page 12, lines 255 to 257.
11. Pg. 12 line 253: “Here, We assessed the frequency in which key
thermography parameters are reported in recent primary biological
literature,………………………
Changed exactly as advised - now page 13, line 278.
12. Pg. 13 line 266: WoS – core collection or all databases? You should name it.
We now clarify in the main text that we search using the Web of
Science Core Collection. See page 13, line 291.
13. Pg. 13 line 267: “(Clarivate Analytics), Our search was limited to papers
available on Web of Science published between 2007 and 2017, with the
final search of Web of Science taking place on 17th December 2017.”
Changed as advised accounting for the change to this sentence in
point 12. Now reads “Our literature search was carried out using
the Web of Science core collection (Clarivate Analytics), limited
to papers published between 2007 and 2017” - now page 13, line
291-293.
14. Pg. 13 line 287: “……………, the corresponding authors (where contact details
provided) were written to requesting contacted for copies of publications.”
Changed as advised - now page 14, line 311.
15. Pg. 14 line 293: “Search results were worked through examined in a
chronological order fashion and assessed by a……………”
Changed exactly as advised - now page 14, line 317.
16. Pg. 14 line 298: ….. were assessed.”
Changed exactly as advised - now page 15, line 323.
17. Pg. 15 line 324: “This review aims to assess life scientists’ use of infrared
cameras in life sciences area. This is reflected in the many varied Web of
Science categories included. However, Thus, if the application of infrared
thermography did not appear to be biological, publications were also
excluded as ‘not biological’.”
Section now reads “This review aims to assess use of infrared
cameras in the life sciences area. Thus, if the application of
infrared thermography did not appear to be biological,
publications were also excluded as ‘not biological’.”- now page
16, line 350-352.
18. Pg. 16 line 344: “Non-excluded Included publications……………”
Changed exactly as advised - now page 17, line 368.
19. Pg. 17 lines 377-393: It is very long and not enough understandable
paragraph – and at the end you jump again at some exclusion criteria.
Advise: Rewrite this paragraph and create table with exclusion criteria so
they can be visible.
The reviewer is correct in saying that there is a secondary group
of papers that are excluded from out analysis but still undergo
our assessment of thermography papers. These are the
‘qualitative’ studies that use thermal cameras but not to
measure temperature. These qualitative papers remain primary
biological publications, and we feel are worth including in our
assessment to show how much different types of life scientists
use thermal cameras and how, hence their inclusion in figure 1.
On the reviewer’s advice the relevant section (now at page
18, lines 401 to 416) has been rewritten to be clearer on this
point. The following section (page 19, lines 417 to 427) discussing
the analysis has been altered to clarify which papers where
included in our analysis and why. Additionally, the new table 2
(found on page 29) has been added to the manuscript to provide
a simple summary of papers excluded from our methods
assessment and later from our analysis. This table is referenced
on, page 15 line 339 and page 19 line 427.
This point is now also touched upon on page 12 line 261,
“…when thermographic temperature measurements are made…”
has been added to account for thermal camera applications that
don’t measure temperature.
20. Pg. 23 line 517-519: Could you please rewrite it to be more
understandable…. (need not be…..
Under the advice of the reviews this sentence has been reworked
into two separate sentences to provide more detail and clarify.
‘need not be’ has been replaced with ‘does not need to be’. This
is now found at page 24 lines 545 to 548, starting “It is likely …”
ending “…in certain research fields.”
21. Pg. 30 line 625: Instead of Bibliography put References
Changed exactly as advised (now page 35, line 684).
22. References: rewrite them all using Vancouver reference style (it seems to me
that this style is preferred by the Journal). Check all the references while
each has punctuation that doesn’t suit this style….
References have been reworked to the Vancouver reference
style. We apologise for this mistake with the format.
23. Would like to see supplements 3 and 4 incorporated in text as tables while
more data presented in tables will give much more visibility and good
insight. The text in which the exclusion criteria are explained is long and in
some parts not so clear so tables will help.
Supplements 3 and 4 are now incorporated into the main test as
tables as advised. Supplement 3 is directly transferred into table
5 (page 31) and now referenced in page 20 line 449. Material
from Supplement 4, is now included in table 7 (page 33),
referenced in the main text on page 21 line 473 and page 22 line
509.
Other changes
The following minor edits have been made at the authors discretion:
“redacted” articles are now called “retracted” (see page 16, line 363, page 19,
line 432, and table 1), as the latter seems to be more widely used and is the
term used by the publishing journal of the single example that occurred in our
search.
The second use of ‘while’ in page 7 line 150 to page 8 line 153 is now changed
to ‘when’ to avoid confusing repetition of the word throughout this sentence.
Renumbering of tables present in original manuscript as appropriate as a
result of additional tables added to this version.
In table 3 (page 30) ‘Datum’ has been replace with ‘Datapoint’ throughout.
We feel this is more reader friendly.
