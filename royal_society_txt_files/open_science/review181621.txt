This is neat little study and a well written paper. I have only a couple of comments that I think
could be addressed.
(1) l. 647: it is surely doubtful that the only thing people learn in ethnographic societies is manual
skills! Knowledge is equally important, not to mention acquiring group-specific cultural
knowledge like folktales.
(2) much is made in the Introduction about the fact that this study will look at natural groups
rather than groups of strangers (as in the Chen study -- and indeed, most experimental studies in
the social sciences). Yet hardly anything is made of this in the Discussion. This is surely the most
interesting aspect of the whole study? Almost everything in this area is done with strangers on
the apparent assumption that our lives consist in buying secondhand cars from untrustworthy
strangers. This might sometimes be the case in economics, but is simply isnt that common in real
social life, most of which involves people we know personally and only very occasionally
involves strangers. So perhaps a bit more discussion of the differences between the Cheng study
and this one in the light of this would be in order? If there are significant differences (as there
were in Henrich's tribal economic games studies), this has very important implications for the
way we do any experiments in the social sciences.

This manuscript examines the emergence of prestige and dominance perceptions among small
group members in “naturally occurring” human groups. Thirty groups of five members formed
on the basis of specific interests (e.g., chess, knitting) were tested individually on general
knowledge quizzes, had an opportunity to discuss and submit quiz answers as a team, and then
nominated a representative to answer additional quiz questions. All group members also rated
each group member, as well as members of the broader community, on dimensions of prestige,
dominance, and influence. The authors find that higher ratings on prestige and dominance were
associated with preexisting group leaders, but these ratings did not predict who would be
nominated as group representative. Rather, the group representative nomination was associated
with the highest individual quiz score, although the individual scores were not known.
I read this manuscript with interest, and I appreciated the efforts taken to obtain a diverse
community sample of groups with varying sets of interests. I also appreciated how the authors
reported both supported and unsupported hypotheses in an unbiased way. I had some questions
and comments that I think would help to clarify some aspects of the paper.
Hypotheses:
It would be helpful if the authors could explain some more about the theorizing regarding the
prestige and dominance constructs. I understand that in previous work (Cheng et al.) prestige
and dominance were shown to be independent such that “influential group members are either
prestigious or dominant, but not both” (p. 12). I also understand that prestige and dominance are
separable dimensions, but it is not as clear to me why they should be independent (H1, p. 10). For
instance, the authors show in the current data that prestige and dominance ratings are negatively
associated. In addition, it seems plausible that there are examples of figures who exhibit both
traits, people who have a high level of expertise and a dominating personality, as well as,
conversely, people who have low expertise and a more subordinate personality. I am also a bit
confused about some of the examples given for each of these dimensions —why is a teacher an
example of a dominant/high status person as opposed to a person from whom to learn (p. 18)?
Almost all the predictions are about prestige, and it seems the only prediction regarding
dominance is about overconfidence. This left me wondering what the utility of examining
dominance is. Theoretically, why do group members tolerate dominant members? Do dominant
members serve some purpose, such as being perceived as providing more existential safety from
outgroup threats compared to prestigious members (who perhaps serve more epistemic needs)?
Or are dominant members tolerated simply because they are feared and might otherwise serve an
existential threat?
Relatedly, I wondered whether there could be a public/private dimension that affects the
nominations. That is, would nominations that are made publicly (i.e., in front of the group) be
driven by dominance ratings?
Theory/Design:
As mentioned earlier, I like that the authors examined existing interest-based groups for greater
ecologically validity than arbitrarily assigned student groups. However, the advantages of
examining the existing groups seem somewhat lost with the current design. That is, it’s not clear
to me what we learn about naturally occurring groups if they are essentially treated as arbitrary
groups. I would have thought that it is potentially more useful to understand the emergence and
existence of prestige and dominance perceptions within the context of each group’s interest. For
example, for a group formed on the basis of interest in chess, it seems that assessments of
prestige, dominance, influence, and learning opportunities would be best assessed on the topic of
chess. As the authors acknowledge, it appears that participants’ judgments were based on
4
preexisting attitudes formed in the context of the group’s organizing interest and prior
interactions, and it seems such attitudes are stronger than the immediate study context of general
knowledge quizzes. Presumably group members don’t know how generally knowledgeable each
other are until they have the group discussion, which makes them functionally similar to the
arbitrary college groups in prior work. This point is touched upon in the discussion, but it seems
a more important consideration for the paper’s theorizing to me.
As the authors note, the broader hypotheses about prestige are not supported in this study in that
higher prestige ratings in the group do not translate to higher perceptions of potential learning,
likely because prestige ratings seem to be based on preexisting attitudes, whereas the social
learning is specific to the general knowledge quiz. It would be helpful if the authors could
elaborate on the potential short-term vs. long-term or context-specific relationship between
prestige and social learning.
Analyses:
I have a few small comments/suggestions that I think make the analyses easier to understand for
readers who may not have expertise with multilevel models (for example, me):
I think the analyses section could be more helpful if it were integrated into the results. As it is
now, the analysis section reads as a list of separate decisions that aren’t so easy to follow because
it’s not always obvious what they are for (e.g., on p. 23 it is stated that “models were said to be a
better fit to the data if they had WAIC value…” but I think the model has not yet been specified.
What are the variables being accounted for? In fact, I don’t think I saw any section in which the
model was clearly specified. For instance, was dominance regressed on prestige? What are other
covariates being used?).
In general, I think it would be helpful to get more explanation about the analysis decisions. For
example, could the authors describe how the decision was made to have an 89%
credible/confidence interval? I understand that the typical intervals of 90 or 95% are somewhat
arbitrary cutoffs but it seems 89% would need to be justified somehow, especially since it seems
the ranges generally aren’t close to crossing zero (e.g., p. 25).
More minor suggestions:
I thought more information from the supplementary materials would be more useful in the main
text. For instance, while reading the main text, I was wondering what the different group types
were — perhaps those could be listed in a main text table.This seems important information
given the emphasis on the use of novel group types compared to previous studies. Additionally, I
thought it would be helpful to include (in the main text) a few examples of the types of items
used to measure prestige and dominance, as well as the scale ranges. I was confused by the
description of prestige vs. dominance ratings that were approximately 1 point apart but were
described as demonstrating perceptions as “highly prestigious but not highly dominant” (p. 25).

Appendix A
Editor's comments:
We are awarding a major revision decision to your paper as the reviewers have identified a number of
matters that must be addressed prior to the paper being considered further for publication. The
reviewers and Editors also note that the anonymisation of study participants is incomplete in the
electronic supplements -- please look again at this and ensure A) that you check this with your ethical
review board and B) respond to this concern (and how you have tackled it) in the response to referees
in your revision. If you need a week or two longer to achieve this owing to the time of year, please let
the editorial office know.
Thank you for your response. Regarding the anonymization, we can reassure the editor and reviewers
that our study participants were fully anonymised throughout the study as they were given ID
numbers for identification and their names were never used or recorded at any time. The names
recorded at the end of the supplementary material are those that participants listed as individuals
who they deem to be influential members of their wider community (e.g. local MPs or celebrities) and
do not include any participants’ names.
==REVIEWER COMMENTS==
To the authors:
Here are a few examples (from the supplementary materials) of people who I think are non-public
figures whose names were listed:
Aade le Pichon (Mother)
Ben Towe (Head teacher)
Christopher Gray (Director of Music, Cathedral)
Colin Cheesman (Neighbour)
Dr Peter Rodgers (GP/chairman of tennis club)
John Goodman (Newquay Facebook Community Admin)
Lesley Chenels (Day care centre manager)
Monty Pearse (Step father)
Although these names are not the names of participants in the study, I wonder about including the
names of such non-public figures (e.g., someone's mother) in a publicly available database for this
study. This may be overly cautious on my part, but it seems that it wouldn't be terribly difficult for
someone in one of these communities to identify the child of Aade le Pichon, for example. If
publishing names of private citizens in the community is not an issue for the local IRB of the authors, I
have no special complaints, but I wanted to double check on this issue.
Thank you for highlighting this possibility. We have now removed any identifying information of non-
public local figures in the supplementary material, as well as the online data files. We have also
removed any link between the lists of community figures (alphabetised) and the participant or group
numbers in the online version of the data files, so that, even if someone from the community were to
know of a participant or group that took part, they could not possibly trace which community figure
that participant/group named. We hope this has now satisfied any concerns.

This is neat little study and a well written paper. I have only a couple of comments that I think could
be addressed.
Thank you for your comments and for taking the time to read our manuscript.
(1) l. 647: it is surely doubtful that the only thing people learn in ethnographic societies is manual
skills! Knowledge is equally important, not to mention acquiring group-specific cultural knowledge like
folktales.
This is true, we were merely stating that the majority of current evidence pertains to learning a skill
and that knowledge is a relatively neglected avenue of research. We have adjusted the wording
accordingly and hope this is now clearer. (lines 659, 664)
(2) much is made in the Introduction about the fact that this study will look at natural groups rather
than groups of strangers (as in the Chen study -- and indeed, most experimental studies in the social
sciences). Yet hardly anything is made of this in the Discussion. This is surely the most interesting
aspect of the whole study? Almost everything in this area is done with strangers on the apparent
assumption that our lives consist in buying secondhand cars from untrustworthy strangers. This might
sometimes be the case in economics, but is simply isnt that common in real social life, most of which
involves people we know personally and only very occasionally involves strangers. So perhaps a bit
more discussion of the differences between the Cheng study and this one in the light of this would be
in order? If there are significant differences (as there were in Henrich's tribal economic games
studies), this has very important implications for the way we do any experiments in the social
sciences.
We agree with the reviewer on the importance of this aspect of our study, hence its prominence in
the Introduction. Paragraph 4 of the Discussion also makes this point, and we have now added
emphasis to the relevant points in that paragraph (lines 566, 579, 584).

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript examines the emergence of prestige and dominance perceptions among small group
members in “naturally occurring” human groups. Thirty groups of five members formed on the basis
of specific interests (e.g., chess, knitting) were tested individually on general knowledge quizzes, had
an opportunity to discuss and submit quiz answers as a team, and then nominated a representative to
answer additional quiz questions. All group members also rated each group member, as well as
members of the broader community, on dimensions of prestige, dominance, and influence. The
authors find that higher ratings on prestige and dominance were associated with preexisting group
leaders, but these ratings did not predict who would be nominated as group representative. Rather,
the group representative nomination was associated with the highest individual quiz score, although
the individual scores were not known.
I read this manuscript with interest, and I appreciated the efforts taken to obtain a diverse community
sample of groups with varying sets of interests. I also appreciated how the authors reported both
supported and unsupported hypotheses in an unbiased way. I had some questions and comments
that I think would help to clarify some aspects of the paper.
Thank you for your kind comments, and for taking time to read the manuscript so thoroughly.
Hypotheses:
It would be helpful if the authors could explain some more about the theorizing regarding the
prestige and dominance constructs. I understand that in previous work (Cheng et al.) prestige and
dominance were shown to be independent such that “influential group members are either
prestigious or dominant, but not both” (p. 12). I also understand that prestige and dominance are
separable dimensions, but it is not as clear to me why they should be independent (H1, p. 10). For
instance, the authors show in the current data that prestige and dominance ratings are negatively
associated. In addition, it seems plausible that there are examples of figures who exhibit both traits,
people who have a high level of expertise and a dominating personality, as well as, conversely, people
who have low expertise and a more subordinate personality.
We hope that our description of dominance and prestige in the Introduction (lines 49-63) make clear
why these two dimensions should be distinct and separable: prestige is based on social learning and
skill, such that highly skilled individuals are given prestige in order for others to gain access to them
and learn from them, while dominance is based on coercion and fear, such that coercive individuals
gain dominance by instilling fear in others. They are distinct because they are generated by different
mechanisms. By ‘independence’ we (and Cheng et al.) mean statistical independence. If two measures
are independent in a sample, this does not mean that specific individuals cannot be high in both, or
low in both; it means that across the sample, there is no statistical relationship between the
measures, and other individuals are high in one and low in another. We have clarified this in places
(e.g. line 186), and refer the reviewer to the cited Henrich & Gil-White (2001) and Cheng et al. (2013)
papers for further details.
I am also a bit confused about some of the examples given for each of these dimensions —why is a
teacher an example of a dominant/high status person as opposed to a person from whom to learn (p.
18)?
The reference to a teacher is asking participants to name “influential” members of their group.
Influential is used throughout our study to refer to someone who could either be prestigious or
dominant, as previous work suggests that prestige and dominance are two distinct routes to gaining
influence over a group (see previous point). Thus, a kayak club may have a teacher who is influential
within the group, and this teacher may then be rated as either prestigious or dominant, or a bit of
both (see previous point). We might expect that teachers are influential because of their expertise,
and hence their prestige, and not their dominance; this was exactly what we set out to investigate in
our study.
Almost all the predictions are about prestige, and it seems the only prediction regarding dominance is
about overconfidence. This left me wondering what the utility of examining dominance is.
Theoretically, why do group members tolerate dominant members? Do dominant members serve
some purpose, such as being perceived as providing more existential safety from outgroup threats
compared to prestigious members (who perhaps serve more epistemic needs)? Or are dominant
members tolerated simply because they are feared and might otherwise serve an existential threat?
The main focus of our predictions were indeed about prestige, as the theory we are testing is
predominantly about the purported evolution of a unique prestige hierarchy in humans (as opposed
to dominance hierarchies that are also found in other species). Thus, we are more interested in
testing if and when prestige hierarchies emerge in humans as opposed to (or as well as) dominance
hierarchies. In particular, we were interested in the relationship that prestige has to knowledge-based
domains, as we predict prestige should be more favoured here (and dominance less so). There are
interesting theories relating to when people may prefer dominant leaders, e.g. when going to war,
but this was not a focus of our current study.
Relatedly, I wondered whether there could be a public/private dimension that affects the
nominations. That is, would nominations that are made publicly (i.e., in front of the group) be driven
by dominance ratings?
This is an interesting point and we debated whether the voting should be public or private. We
decided on private as we reasoned that voting order in a public vote could influence subsequent
voters, and controlling for this would be practically very tricky. A public vote would also answer a
slightly different question, (i.e. how do people vote when they know the group is watching/listening,
or how are peoples’ votes affected by others’ votes). We chose to implement a private vote as we
wanted to get as honest an opinion as possible, hopefully revealing peoples’ genuine preferences
based on the group interaction. This is now mentioned on lines 179-181.
Theory/Design:
As mentioned earlier, I like that the authors examined existing interest-based groups for greater
ecologically validity than arbitrarily assigned student groups. However, the advantages of examining
the existing groups seem somewhat lost with the current design. That is, it’s not clear to me what we
learn about naturally occurring groups if they are essentially treated as arbitrary groups. I would have
thought that it is potentially more useful to understand the emergence and existence of prestige and
dominance perceptions within the context of each group’s interest. For example, for a group formed
on the basis of interest in chess, it seems that assessments of prestige, dominance, influence, and
learning opportunities would be best assessed on the topic of chess.
We weren’t initially interested in the idiosyncrasies of the individual groups- as is shown by our
preregistered predictions, we were expecting to replicate previous studies with unacquainted groups,
so predicted their prestige ratings to be related to their performance on the quiz. However, this
prediction was not upheld, and we found an unexpected finding that prestige was tied to existing
positions within the groups. This was not something we were initially looking to investigate, therefore
we haven’t emphasised between-group differences in this study. We agree this would be an
interesting avenue for future research. Our prestige, dominance, influence and learning
questionnaires were not tied to the quiz, but were general questions about the participants’ general
tendencies, and so could have been related to chess within the chess teams (and probably were). The
only ratings related to the quiz were the group votes, which were not related to the groups’ previous
interactions, but on the quiz itself. This is now discussed explicitly in the Discussion, lines 588-594.
As the authors acknowledge, it appears that participants’ judgments were based on preexisting
attitudes formed in the context of the group’s organizing interest and prior interactions, and it seems
such attitudes are stronger than the immediate study context of general knowledge quizzes.
Presumably group members don’t know how generally knowledgeable each other are until they have
the group discussion, which makes them functionally similar to the arbitrary college groups in prior
work. This point is touched upon in the discussion, but it seems a more important consideration for
the paper’s theorizing to me.
It may be the case that groups didn’t know about each other’s general knowledge until the group
discussion, but we don’t know that for sure. Even if this did make them functionally similar to
arbitrary groups, our results show that they weren’t functionally similar, in that they based their
prestige/dominance ratings on previous interactions, rather than the general knowledge discussion.
We have emphasised this more in the paragraph of the discussion which touches on this (lines 550-
557 and 564-594).
As the authors note, the broader hypotheses about prestige are not supported in this study in that
higher prestige ratings in the group do not translate to higher perceptions of potential learning, likely
because prestige ratings seem to be based on preexisting attitudes, whereas the social learning is
specific to the general knowledge quiz. It would be helpful if the authors could elaborate on the
potential short-term vs. long-term or context-specific relationship between prestige and social
learning.
This is a good point and is nicely addressed in Redhead et al’s recent paper, which we have now cited
in our discussion, line 587.
Analyses:
I have a few small comments/suggestions that I think make the analyses easier to understand for
readers who may not have expertise with multilevel models (for example, me):
I think the analyses section could be more helpful if it were integrated into the results. As it is now,
the analysis section reads as a list of separate decisions that aren’t so easy to follow because it’s not
always obvious what they are for (e.g., on p. 23 it is stated that “models were said to be a better fit to
the data if they had WAIC value…” but I think the model has not yet been specified. What are the
variables being accounted for? In fact, I don’t think I saw any section in which the model was clearly
specified. For instance, was dominance regressed on prestige? What are other covariates being
used?).
Thank you for highlighting this, we have now altered the analysis section to hopefully be clearer,
starting on line 337. We have highlighted that Tables 1, 2, and 3 include all of the model parameters
including the varying effects and predicted outcomes, and have altered the table legends to
emphasise this.
In general, I think it would be helpful to get more explanation about the analysis decisions. For
example, could the authors describe how the decision was made to have an 89% credible/confidence
interval? I understand that the typical intervals of 90 or 95% are somewhat arbitrary cutoffs but it
seems 89% would need to be justified somehow, especially since it seems the ranges generally aren’t
close to crossing zero (e.g., p. 25).
We have highlighted that 89% intervals are default in the Rethinking package, and that using 95%
intervals, as is the arbitrary norm, would not alter the interpretation of our results.
More minor suggestions:
I thought more information from the supplementary materials would be more useful in the main text.
For instance, while reading the main text, I was wondering what the different group types were —
perhaps those could be listed in a main text table. This seems important information given the
emphasis on the use of novel group types compared to previous studies. Additionally, I thought it
would be helpful to include (in the main text) a few examples of the types of items used to measure
prestige and dominance, as well as the scale ranges.
As our manuscript is already heavily loaded with tables and figures of results and model
specifications, we would rather keep additional information that is not relevant for our predictions,
analyses or interpretations in the supplementary material. As between-group differences were not a
measure of interest in this particular study, we would rather keep the main manuscript free from
distractions. Readers who are particularly interested in our study groups can access that information
not only in the supplementary material but also on the online Github repository listed in the text.
I was confused by the description of prestige vs. dominance ratings that were approximately 1 point
apart but were described as demonstrating perceptions as “highly prestigious but not highly
dominant” (p. 25).
Although it appears these ratings are approximately only 1 point apart, these are ordinal Likert scale
ratings (1-7), and so a difference of one point on the scale can be quite meaningful. Nevertheless, we
have altered the wording so as not to be confusing/misleading (line 394).

Comments to the Author(s)
I appreciate the efforts taken by the authors to address some of my prior
questions and comments in their response. I also think many of the small
edits that were made in the manuscript to address these points are helpful. I
had just a few points of clarification I wanted to raise that I think would
further strengthen the paper, which I hope the authors will consider.
It occurred to me that part of my prior confusion about how the authors
were discussing prestige and dominance likely stemmed from a lack of clear
definition of these terms in the context of the study. I think it would be
helpful to explicitly define what the authors mean by prestige and dominance
(in addition to the existing discussion about who gains these characteristics
and what outcomes they gain from holding these characteristics).
Thank you for highlighting this, we have now adjusted the wording in the
abstract and the introduction to be clearer about how prestige and
dominance are defined in our study.
The authors refer to their study as an experiment, but it doesn’t seem to me
that any variable has been manipulated in the study. I think it would be
clearer and more accurate to refrain from describing the study as an
experiment.
Whilst we acknowledge that no experimental manipulations were carried out,
we feel the research is still best described as an experiment rather than
purely observational, as each group was tested in controlled conditions with
identical measures taken across all individuals and across all groups.
Finally, I also appreciate that the authors made efforts to anonymise many of
the non-public people named by participants in the survey about wider
community members. I wanted to ask if the authors could take another look
at the “want to learn” list – some names of private citizens are listed with the
person’s relationship to the participant, and there are some names that seem
relatively unusual. Again, I may be unusually careful with respect to these
anonymisation concerns, but I think the authors would be practicing
admirable open science/data even with some additional non-public persons’
names anonymised.
Although some names listed may be those of private citizens, we as authors
have no way of knowing which names represent public figures, or semi-public
(i.e. locally well-known) figures unless we research every name
independently. For example, many of those names listed are locally-
influential artists. Thus, we either have to anonymise every entry (including
obvious public figures such as Jeremy Corbyn/David Attenborough etc) or
none of the entries. Although the “commRatings” included information about
the individuals’ position, and thus could potentially be linked to a particular
group, this list has no such information as it only lists traits the others would
like to learn from them. None of the names can be associated with any of the
participants, even those named as ‘mother’ as they are decoupled from the
rest of the database and reordered, and given that there is no way of
knowing which participant listed which individual, we feel it is appropriate to
leave the data as they are as they do not breach our ethics approval in any
way.
