The authors conducted a systematic review of studies investigating the effects of climate change
on reptile and amphibian species. Importantly, the authors also address biases in this research
related to geography, taxonomy, and including (or not) alternative hypotheses. Additionally, the
authors make recommendations for future research based on their results: testing alternative
hypotheses, including effect sizes, the need for measures of statistical power, greater emphasis on
mechanistic studies, and a broader taxonomic and geographic scope for climate change research
will improve future research. Overall this review was well-researched, the methods and analyses
are appropriate (where limitations arose, they were clearly addressed), and the conclusions are
well within the scope of the results. I consider all of my comments to be minor.
Decimal points for P values should be consistent throughout (currently ranges from 2-6)
Line 142: specie should be “species”
Lines 236-242: Consider moving to methods, but not necessary
The paragraph from lines 486-489 seems like an afterthought and a bit underdeveloped. Perhaps
more is needed here in the context of this review (e.g., not biasing studies with the expectation
that an effect of climate change will be negative).
Table2: Amphibia/Reptilia are not repeated in rows for negative impact but are repeated each
row for positive impact. Should be consistent (similar to table 5 where Europe and North
America are repeated).
Figures 1&3: All other figures and tables refer to Amphibia/Reptilia but here its Amphibian(s)
and Reptile(s), should be consistent.

There doesn't seem to be a statement providing access to supporting data at the end of the
document (apologies if I've missed it). Even though this is a review, I think a final file of the
extracted data should be archived and made available through a data repository for others to
check. The supplementary material seems fine to me.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This manuscript reviews the climate change research that has been undertaken on amphibians
and reptiles, and covers an important subject, particularly given the amphibian extinctions which
have so far been attributed to climate change. I like the assessment of different biases, and the
attempts to outline variation in detected impacts of climate change. However, I have a number of
general criticisms to make of the approach undertaken, that in my view make the interpretation
of the manuscript more difficult than it need be. These are outlined below, before listing some
additional, more specific comments.
General comments
1. Analytical approach. I have some reservations about the analytical approach used. Whilst it is
clear that the authors have considered what I would have been my preferred approach to this
analysis, of using mixed-effect models to account for the non-independence of data from the
same study, this did not appear to work (L207-211). As a result they have used two different
approaches, one in which study is the unit of analysis, and the second, where species is, which,
as the authors acknowledge, could be argued as being pseudo-replicated in cases of studies
covering multiple species. They cite the comparable results for both approaches as support for
their approach (L182-188), although only the results of the latter approach are presented. Whilst I
largely accept these arguments (although see below), at the very least, I would like to see a
supplementary file with a clear summary of both analyses to support the statement of L186-187.
This description of the approach has raised some other concerns. Many studies will undertake
multiple testing of the effects of climate change on a species – whether in relation to different
biological parameters, or different climate variables. Some studies may detect both significant
and non-significant impacts of the same variable, or even contrasting responses to the same
variable, for example depending upon season. It is not clear how this will have been summarised.
For example, a study may examine the effects of say five temperature variables upon a biological
parameter. Some of these tests may be positive, and others negative. I am afraid I do not know
how this will have been interpreted. An example or two may help the reader here. My reading of
the methods is that effects will have been summarised as either significant (1) or not (0) for the
population (species x study combination) as a whole, which means that the interpretation of some
studies with such mixed effects would be difficult or subjective. This needs to be clarified in the
manuscript.
If I am correct, then the probability of detecting a significant effect must be a function of the
number of variables considered in a particular study, which does not seem to have been
recorded. Surely this should be an additional variable to be included in the analysis? Again, if I
am correct (and apologies if not), then I would prefer an approach where all of the relevant tests
in a study were captured in the dataset, leading to many more data points per study, but more
fully reflecting the true nature of the data. Recording the data in this way might also help with
the use of mixed-effect models in the analysis (my first point).
2. Most analysis combines both observed and projected future impacts. In my view, these are
fundamentally different, the results of which cannot be combined in a meaningful way. Observed
4
impacts are valuable because they provide evidence for climate change impacting on species’
populations and distributions now (albeit over a relatively short time-period), whilst future
projected studies are predictive studies which depending upon the quality of the underpinning
model, may or may not reflect reality at all. I am not surprised that climate envelope modelling
studies of future projections showed a greater probability of changes in species’ distribution than
observed change (L341-348). Instead, I think this means that the results for both types of studies
(observed and projected future impacts) should be presented separately. Even if this limits the
sample size for analysis, reducing the number of tests that can be performed and the scope of the
review, I think that would be preferable to the current manuscript where I am left wondering
what the results really mean. For example, statements such as ‘almost two out of three amphibian
and reptilian species were detectably affected by climate change (L425-426)' will get widely
quoted from this study, but surely are not defensible if based largely on projected rather than
observational studies.
3. The direction of effects. Frequently in the results, whether studies found positive or negative
effects is mentioned (e.g. L309, L356, 361-). Given the range of biological parameters included,
from population and range size studies on the one hand, to studies of phenology or range shift on
the other, it is unclear how impacts on these different biological parameters are treated in this
single analysis (if at all)? Are some included but others excluded? Further detail is necessary in
both the methods and results to make it clear exactly which sort of study and parameter are
included in each test, because I can’t believe that all of the data are included in such analyses.
4. Length. Although I am unclear of the total length of the manuscript, sections of the results in
particular seem overlie descriptive and could be cut-down. At the same time, greater clarity
needs to be provided to make it easier for the reader to follow what has been done (See above).
Specific comments
Methods. L88. It has recently come to my attention that different institutions have access to
different web of Science databases depending upon their license. Therefore, the information
provided is insufficient for another to be able to follow this search exactly. Whilst I accept that
this information is rarely provided in studies such as this, if it was possible to provide this in a
supplementary file, that would be valuable.
Methds. L90-91. How many studies were found by contacting authors and reading other articles?
Did they differ in their scope and content to the studies found through Web of Science (i.e. did
these additional literature, if sufficiently numerous, contribute to or reduce the biases noted)?
Methods. L103-105. I agree with the need for data for climate change observational studies to be
collected over multiple years, although it is unclear how this cut-off relates to climate envelope
modelling studies – the authors should clarify how criteria 3 and 5 relate.
Methods. L121-132. Separating studies into those which detect significant impacts (1) from those
which don’t (0) is sensible in a study such as this, for the reasons given. However, a number of
key parameters could influence the probability of detecting a significant effect (e.g. sample size,
the presence of other predictor variables, study duration, the number of tests undertaken), which
I would have liked the authors to have tested, as these parameters may well covary with others
that have been tested.
Methods, L144. How was elevation treated in studies across multiple study-sites?
Methods. L188. As already mentioned, please provide a comparison of the tests using both
methods in the supplementary material.
5
Resuts. L251-292. There is too much text here. L257-261 is unnecessary, whilst L271-290 could
probably also be cut. Given all the text about bias, I am surprised by the lack of significant
contrast in L292, which perhaps needs a little more explanation.
I hope that these comments are useful. Best wishes in revising your manuscript.

label_comment_3
The authors have presented a detailed and careful response to my previous comments, and I
accept what they have stated about the limitations of the underling data, and therefore the
limitations of the analysis that can be conducted. This is a clearly presented and nice analysis of
the state (and limitations) of our understanding of climate change impacts on reptiles and
amphibians. I have a couple of minor points of comment on their response letter, and on the
submitted manuscript which are outlined below for consideration.
Response letter.
1. 3. Direction of effects. Apologies if I’ve missed it, but I can’t see in the revised
manuscript if studies of observed phonological change have been included or excluded from the
analysis of the direction of effects. As phenological change (whether positive (delay) or negative
(advance)) does not relate directly to changes in demosgraphy, population or range extent, I
would argue that data from studies purely describing phonological change should be excluded.
2. Methods. L88. I wasn’t suggesting that all of the studies were listed, but that the Web of
science databases used in the search were listed, which vary between institutions depending
upon their web of science license. However, this is a minor point and don’t worry if not readily
available.
Manuscript
1. L74-76. How does this statement match up with recent studies suggesting that the main
impacts of climate change upon species will be mediated through biotic interactions (Cahill et al.
2012 Proc Roy Soc, Ockendon et al. 2014 GCB).
2. L155. What were the 19 possible types? Could these be listed as an appendix?
3. L295. How does this proportion of data deficient species compare with the proportion on
the IUCN list?

limitations of the analysis that can be conducted. This is a clearly presented and nice analysis of
the state (and limitations) of our understanding of climate change impacts on reptiles and
amphibians. I have a couple of minor points of comment on their response letter, and on the
submitted manuscript which are outlined below for consideration.
Response letter.
1. 3. Direction of effects. Apologies if I’ve missed it, but I can’t see in the revised
manuscript if studies of observed phonological change have been included or excluded from the
analysis of the direction of effects. As phenological change (whether positive (delay) or negative
(advance)) does not relate directly to changes in demosgraphy, population or range extent, I
would argue that data from studies purely describing phonological change should be excluded.
2. Methods. L88. I wasn’t suggesting that all of the studies were listed, but that the Web of
science databases used in the search were listed, which vary between institutions depending
upon their web of science license. However, this is a minor point and don’t worry if not readily
available.
Manuscript
1. L74-76. How does this statement match up with recent studies suggesting that the main
impacts of climate change upon species will be mediated through biotic interactions (Cahill et al.
2012 Proc Roy Soc, Ockendon et al. 2014 GCB).
2. L155. What were the 19 possible types? Could these be listed as an appendix?
3. L295. How does this proportion of data deficient species compare with the proportion on
the IUCN list?

Appendix A
Before describing our responses to the specific comments of the two reviewers we will summarize
what we have done in response to the reviews. First, we thank the reviewers for their time, and in
particular James Pearce-Higgins for taking the time that he did to think about our methods of analysis
and suggest improvements. The result was an essentially complete re-analysis of our data, although
the results reported in the revised manuscript are largely unchanged from those reported in the
previous version of the manuscript.
One reason for the re-analyses was that the data set we used changed, with the deletion of all
information from studies that used climate projection models after the initial bias-exploration part of
the Results section. We agree with James that studies projecting potential future impacts of climate
change are fundamentally different from studies that look retrospectively for evidence of existing
effects of climate change, and the prior version of this manuscript even showed that climate-
projection studies were qualitatively different in that they had higher rates of reporting impacts of
climate change. The revised manuscript now not only notes this difference, but as an implication it
separates out climate projection studies. While James suggested parallel analyses of the
“retrospective” and “projection” studies, there were too few studies in the latter group to examine
patterns of taxonomic or geographic variation in reported responses within the relatively small set of
climate projection model studies. So, once we had identified study type as a bias, we separated out
the climate projection modelling studies from the rest, and only present results of the re-analyses for
the larger group of studies that look for impacts of climate change that have already occurred.
The second reason for re-analyses of the data was to make another attempt at dealing with the
variation in the number of species represented in each of the reviewed papers. As an aside, we have
also added some information into the text in order to note that most studies only report information
from a single species (median number of species per study is 1, upper quartile is roughly 3). After
considerable time expended on experimenting with alternative approaches for the analyses of our
data, we came to the conclusion that there is no way of using the most elegant (and seemingly
appropriate) analytical methods with the data compiled in the review. Bluntly, there is no cohesive
plan or coordination among all of the people who have studied the potential impacts of climate
change on amphibians and reptiles, and as a result any attempts to summarize these data cannot use
elegant analytical methods (e.g., formal analyses of effects using meta-analytic methods, mixed
models). We even found in our re-analyses that our attempt to control for non-independence of
multiple species (i.e. by treating each study as a data record, and counts of “success” and “failure”
species as a 2-part response variable) within studies did not always work as we had expected: in re-
analyses following removal of the projection-model studies, we often found identical results (i.e.
regression parameter estimates, standard errors, p-values) when we treated each species or each
study as a separate data row. We do not have a clear idea why this should happen, but suspect that
this outcome is related to the large proportion of single-species studies. Pragmatically, we do not
think that it is worth presenting in parallel the two types of analyses (with and without attempts to
control for varying numbers of species among reviewed papers), because doing so would be more
confusing than helpful. As a result, we have added text to the Methods in the section that already
describes why we did not use meta-analyses or mixed models.
The above is effectively a capitulation to the limitations of the data, and it brings up the question of
whether the data that we have analysed are even useful at all. We have thought about this, and we
still believe that the answer is “yes”…within limitations. We also feel that our uses of the data stay
within these limitations. Specifically, one of the two general uses to which we have put the data is to
explore what is exactly the weakness of these data: the biases in what has and has not been studied.
This is the very first information presented in the Results section, and an entire section of the
Discussion (“Recommendations for future research”) is based on the results of these analyses
exploring biases. The “Conclusions” section ends with a statement of the limitations in utility of the
existing data for making sweeping global conclusions or using the studies for conservation and
management. Regarding our uses of the data to reach biological conclusions about impacts of
climate change, we have noted in the Methods section the caveat that “…our conclusions need to be
viewed as the most accurate assessment of the existing climate-change research on amphibians and
reptiles given the diverse and uncoordinated nature of the types of studies conducted within the last
decade. “ We also have restricted our analyses (second part of the Results section “Directions of the
effects of climate variables”) to exploring relatively simple patterns of proportions of species that
have been suggested to be negatively or positively affected by climate change. These analyses have,
nevertheless, been taking a set up in sophistication from prior reviews that have not attempted to
determine whether the impacts of climate change on amphibians and reptiles are likely to vary
geographically or among taxonomic subgroups. That we found patterns at all is important in that it
suggests that more systematic attention needs to be paid to the geographic regions and taxa that
should be studied in the future.
The above is generally what we have considered and done in response to the reviewers’ comments.
Below, we describe our responses to each of the comments in turn. The reviewers’ comments are in
normal font, and our replies in italics.
Response to comments from author:
Reviewer 1:
• Decimal points for P values should be consistent throughout (currently ranges from 2-6)
We now list all p-values to 2 digits after the decimal point, except for cases in which the first
two digits are zeros. If this was the case, then we wrote out the zeros until the first non-zero
digit.
• Line 142: specie should be “species”.
Fixed.
Lines 236-242: Consider moving to methods, but not necessary.
We kept it there because the information directly relates to the results.
The paragraph from lines 486-489 seems like an afterthought and a bit underdeveloped.
Perhaps more is needed here in the context of this review (e.g., not biasing studies with the
expectation that an effect of climate change will be negative).
We added: “Care should be taken, that studies and analyses are not biased towards the
expectation that their results will indicate a negative effect of climate change.”
• Table2: Amphibia/Reptilia are not repeated in rows for negative impact but are repeated
each row for positive impact. Should be consistent (similar to table 5 where Europe and
North America are repeated).
We repeated the classes in Table 2.
• Figures 1&3: All other figures and tables refer to Amphibia/Reptilia but here its Amphibian(s)
and Reptile(s), should be consistent.
We have changed the names in these two figures.
Reviewer: 2
General comments
1. Analytical approach. I have some reservations about the analytical approach used. Whilst it is clear
that the authors have considered what I would have been my preferred approach to this analysis, of
using mixed-effect models to account for the non-independence of data from the same study, this
did not appear to work (L207-211). As a result they have used two different approaches, one in which
study is the unit of analysis, and the second, where species is, which, as the authors acknowledge,
could be argued as being pseudo-replicated in cases of studies covering multiple species. They cite
the comparable results for both approaches as support for their approach (L182-188), although only
the results of the latter approach are presented. Whilst I largely accept these arguments (although
see below), at the very least, I would like to see a supplementary file with a clear summary of both
analyses to support the statement of L186-187.
The reviewer’s statement that we have presented “…only the results from the latter approach…” is
not quite correct. In the text of the Results section we had presented the p-values calculated for focal
effects from both approaches (note that there are some analyses for which this was irrelevant, when
species were not the unit of analysis). Regardless, this has become a moot point, as we have removed
all of the analyses in which each study was treated as a separate data record. We have described in
our general comments, above, the reason for having made this change.
This description of the approach has raised some other concerns. Many studies will undertake
multiple testing of the effects of climate change on a species – whether in relation to different
biological parameters, or different climate variables. Some studies may detect both significant and
non-significant impacts of the same variable, or even contrasting responses to the same variable, for
example depending upon season. It is not clear how this will have been summarized. For example, a
study may examine the effects of say five temperature variables upon a biological parameter. Some
of these tests may be positive, and others negative. I am afraid I do not know how this will have been
interpreted. An example or two may help the reader here. My reading of the methods is that effects
will have been summarised as either significant (1) or not (0) for the population (species x study
combination) as a whole, which means that the interpretation of some studies with such mixed
effects would be difficult or subjective. This needs to be clarified in the manuscript.
We have modified the text in our Methods section to hopefully make clearer the process that was
used, as well as the reason for reducing the large diversity of different possible responses into a single
catch-all response type. On lines 149 - 170 we have expanded upon the original text to provide a
description of what we have done that is hopefully detailed enough that our process would be
replicable.
If I am correct, then the probability of detecting a significant effect must be a function of the number
of variables considered in a particular study, which does not seem to have been recorded. Surely this
should be an additional variable to be included in the analysis? Again, if I am correct (and apologies if
not), then I would prefer an approach where all of the relevant tests in a study were captured in the
dataset, leading to many more data points per study, but more fully reflecting the true nature of the
data. Recording the data in this way might also help with the use of mixed-effect models in the
analysis (my first point).
Given that most of the studies (77 of 109, a statistic now noted in the Methods section (lines 160-164)
examined only a single response we believe that this is likely not an issue. Further, it is not clear what
sort of statistical correction would be appropriate, given that each class of response might have a
different probability of producing a significant effect. Thus, we have not followed the suggestion of
treating each of these response types as a separate record and then modelling using random effects
to deal with the multiple appearances of each study-species combination within the resultant data.
While the reviewer’s suggestion is appealing, we did not follow it for the pragmatic reason that it
would not work. There would be a substantial proportion of study-species combinations that only
appeared once in the data because only a single response variable was examined; as a result, models
with this type of random effect would fail to converge, as we had found in our attempts to deal with
multiple species within a study using random effects. This left us with the possibility of including the
use of number-of-response-variables as a predictor variable. If we did this, we would face the
potential criticism that not all responses were equally likely to show responses, and further we would
have to explore whether variation in the samples sizes (and potentially statistical power) associated
with each class of response…and the studies to not universally provide this information. This was
another instance in which we opted for simplicity over statistical elegance that we believe would have
caused more problems than it would have solved.
2. Most analysis combines both observed and projected future impacts. In my view, these are
fundamentally different, the results of which cannot be combined in a meaningful way. Observed
impacts are valuable because they provide evidence for climate change impacting on species’
populations and distributions now (albeit over a relatively short time-period), whilst future projected
studies are predictive studies which depending upon the quality of the underpinning model, may or
may not reflect reality at all. I am not surprised that climate envelope modelling studies of future
projections showed a greater probability of changes in species’ distribution than observed change
(L341-348). Instead, I think this means that the results for both types of studies (observed and
projected future impacts) should be presented separately. Even if this limits the sample size for
analysis, reducing the number of tests that can be performed and the scope of the review, I think
that would be preferable to the current manuscript where I am left wondering what the results really
mean. For example, statements such as ‘almost two out of three amphibian and reptilian species
were detectably affected by climate change (L425-426)' will get widely quoted from this study, but
surely are not defensible if based largely on projected rather than observational studies.
See our general comments at the beginning of our descriptions of responses. In brief repetition of
what we described above, we have included the data from studies of projected future responses in
our examinations of biases within the data, and discarded these data entirely from subsequent
analyses that looked for differences in patterns of reported responses in the latter part of the Results
section. A fair amount of text was already in the Discussion section of the previous version of the
manuscript talking about the issue of climate projection modelling. We have not altered this section
of the Discussion in any tangible way.
3. The direction of effects. Frequently in the results, whether studies found positive or negative
effects is mentioned (e.g. L309, L356, 361-). Given the range of biological parameters included, from
population and range size studies on the one hand, to studies of phenology or range shift on the
other, it is unclear how impacts on these different biological parameters are treated in this single
analysis (if at all)? Are some included but others excluded? Further detail is necessary in both the
methods and results to make it clear exactly which sort of study and parameter are included in each
test, because I can’t believe that all of the data are included in such analyses.
Unfortunately, we were forced to do exactly what the reviewer could not believe was done: all forms
of responses from all studies looking at all predictors of climate change were treated as if they were
equal in the analyses that we conducted. If we had not done so, there would have been insufficient
data to do anything or to make any, even extremely general, conclusions. Briefly repeating some of
our opening comments, after we finished compiling data from the literature review we were faced
with the realization that we would either have to conduct the analyses as we did and produce the
very coarse-level conclusions that we did, or we could just abandon this project. We believe that
there is value in what we have done in part because this systematic review highlights the deficiencies
of our current knowledge. As a result of the reviewer’s comments, we have realized that we needed
to be more explicit in the manuscript in addressing the reviewer’s concerns, because these concerns
are very relevant to the extent to which the published literature on responses to climate change in
amphibians and reptiles can be used. In light of the above, we have made the following changes to
the manuscript:
- We have clarified how the data were summarized for use (in response to the reviewer’s first
numbered comment)
- We have added a short note in the Methods section explicitly noting the need for such coarse-
level summarization of the diverse responses, and the limits to what can be concluded as a
result.
- We have discarded data from climate projection models after identifying the bias of their
higher probabilities of reporting effects of climate change.
4. Length. Although I am unclear of the total length of the manuscript, sections of the results in
particular seem overlie descriptive and could be cut-down. At the same time, greater clarity needs to
be provided to make it easier for the reader to follow what has been done (See above).
We tried to shorten it were possible. But the shortening was likely outcompeted by clarification.
Specific comments
Methods. L88. It has recently come to my attention that different institutions have access to
different web of Science databases depending upon their license. Therefore, the information
provided is insufficient for another to be able to follow this search exactly. Whilst I accept that this
information is rarely provided in studies such as this, if it was possible to provide this in a
supplementary file, that would be valuable.
We had an initial number of 1818 articles. It does not seem feasible to list them all.
Methods. L90-91. How many studies were found by contacting authors and reading other articles?
Did they differ in their scope and content to the studies found through Web of Science (i.e. did these
additional literature, if sufficiently numerous, contribute to or reduce the biases noted)?
We added to the methods section: “This initial search gave us a list of 1818 articles. We also included
studies (N = 123) that we found in the process of contacting authors and reading other articles. After
initial screening we still had to assess 539 articles in more detail. Only 104 of those articles fit our
selection criteria and were included in the analysis.” We did not mark the added literature. So we do
not know if there was a bias in the types of added articles.
Methods. L103-105. I agree with the need for data for climate change observational studies to be
collected over multiple years, although it is unclear how this cut-off relates to climate envelope
modelling studies – the authors should clarify how criteria 3 and 5 relate.
Climate envelope studies typically base their analysis on distribution data that were collected over
many years. But the number of years rarely communicated in the papers. For example, studies
mention that distribution data are from national surveys or from the determination of threat status in
the Red List. Therefore, we cannot say if the 5-year criterion fits to those studies. But it seems very
likely that such distribution data are based on many years of surveying. We added: “We also included
studies whose data were collected in disjunctive time intervals that were at least five years apart, and
studies that modeled future distributions based on current distribution data from atlas data or long-
term studies.”
Methods. L121-132. Separating studies into those which detect significant impacts (1) from those
which don’t (0) is sensible in a study such as this, for the reasons given. However, a number of key
parameters could influence the probability of detecting a significant effect (e.g. sample size, the
presence of other predictor variables, study duration, the number of tests undertaken), which I
would have liked the authors to have tested, as these parameters may well covary with others that
have been tested.
We believe that we have addressed many details of this comment in responses that are given above.
Basically, we agree that it would be great to have done all of the types of controls that you noted.
However, the reality of the situation is that response types of studies were so diverse, and the actual
information presented in the reviewed papers so haphazard that conducting these sorts of
(important) statistical controls could not be done.
Methods, L144. How was elevation treated in studies across multiple study-sites?
Unfortunately, altitude was one of the variables that was rarely given in the studies. We did
determine altitude for those studies that gave the exact geographic location. But that left us with a
data set with many unknown elevation data. Therefore, elevation was not included in the analysis.
We added this information to the Methods section.
Methods. L188. As already mentioned, please provide a comparison of the tests using both methods
in the supplementary material.
As noted in previous responses, this is now a moot point, as we removed all of the analyses using the
second method of modelling.
Results. L251-292. There is too much text here. L257-261 is unnecessary, whilst L271-290 could
probably also be cut. Given all the text about bias, I am surprised by the lack of significant contrast in
L292, which perhaps needs a little more explanation.
We have removed a large amount of the original text in response to these comments, after agreeing
that it was not necessary. Regarding the lack of significance in the statistical test described in this
paragraph, we are hoping that the new topic sentence for the revised paragraph makes clear that
there is not necessarily a connection between lack of bias found here, and the presence of biased
representation described in the previous paragraphs. The extent of bias in sampling is dependent on
the level of taxonomic resolution. The previous paragraphs described unequal rates of study of
species within families. The last paragraph describes proportions of representation of families within
orders: at this coarser level of taxonomic resolution the uneven sampling did not even approach a
statistically-significant level.
Appendix B
Thank you for improving our manuscript by nudging us on important questions. We are very
glad that you accept the limitations of our data.
Below our responses to the comments from James Pearce-Higgins:
1. Direction of effects. Apologies if I’ve missed it, but I can’t see in the revised manuscript if
studies of observed phonological change have been included or excluded from the analysis
of the direction of effects. As phenological change (whether positive (delay) or negative
(advance)) does not relate directly to changes in demosgraphy, population or range extent,
I would argue that data from studies purely describing phonological change should be
excluded.
You did not miss this. We had failed to state the needed information. We had done exactly as
you suggested should be done: we did not include any studies of phenology in analyses that
examined directions of response to climate change. So we added the following sentence in
Line 362: “We did not use data from phenological studies in these analyses, because they do
not directly affect populations.”
2. Methods. L88. I wasn’t suggesting that all of the studies were listed, but that the Web of
science databases used in the search were listed, which vary between institutions depending
upon their web of science license. However, this is a minor point and don’t worry if not
readily available.
I added Pik to the sentence in Line 91: “We searched the Web of Science on the portal
available through the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) for articles that
investigated current or future effects of various climatic factors on amphibians and reptiles.”
Manuscript
1. L74-76. How does this statement match up with recent studies suggesting that the main
impacts of climate change upon species will be mediated through biotic interactions
(Cahill et al. 2012 Proc Roy Soc, Ockendon et al. 2014 GCB).
The paper by Ockendon et al did not investigate amphibians but birds, fish, invertebrates and
plants. Although their finding is interesting, we feel that it is a tangent to our paper. The
paper investigates the mechanisms of effects of climate change, not of the patterns of
responses per se. We have, however, noted the Ockendon et al. paper in passing on L74. We
hope that this is the best way to note that even extotherms may be influenced by climate
change through the mechanism of biotic interactions, but without causing a distraction from
our paper’s emphasis on patterns. Similarly, Cahill included only 4 species of amphibians
from Yellowstone and there the proximate cause for decline was “increasing temperature
and decreasing precipitation cause a decline in habitat availability (pond drying)”. They did
not include reptiles in their study. Beyond this one change, we do not feel that speculation on
biotic interactions would improve our paper.
2. L155. What were the 19 possible types? Could these be listed as an appendix?
Sorry, this should say 24 possible types. The specific types can be seen in table S2. I changed
the sentence in L155 to:
“In our description of the papers that we reviewed, we categorized the responses examined by
researchers into 24 possible types (see table S2), some of which were rarely investigated;”
3. L295. How does this proportion of data deficient species compare with the proportion on
the IUCN list?
We cannot compare those two lists of species directly, because several species were not
investigated by the Red List at all. Thus, if we had made this comparison the process would
not have been simple: we would have needed to identify patters of bias in the species that
were not present on the Red List due to lack of data on them and take any such biases into
account when trying to interpret comparisons between the two lists. Our suspicion is that
the process is too fraught with weaknesses to attempt to compare these two lists.
