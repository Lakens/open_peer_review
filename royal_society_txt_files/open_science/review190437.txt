Review of “Exfoliated transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanosheets for supercapacitor and
sodium ion battery applications”, Manuscript ID: RSOS-190437.
In this manuscript, the authors fabricated the TMD nanosheet papers using a superacid
exfoliation approach and testified and compared different TMD in their electrochemical
performance compared with pure rGO.
To help improve the scientific depth of their study, I raised several questions/suggestions as
below, including corrections, further clarification, as well as more result supplemental.
1. What is the authors’ definition or criteria for “superacid” in terms of pH or concentration?
2. The authors mentioned dew point of -50C in the glove box. Is it for the superacid solution? In
addition, what would happen when pouring superacid into TMD fast?
3. The authors baked the superacid treated TMD flake solutions. Did they wash the flakes before
the next step in order to remove the superacid residues?
4. Please state in context the functions of PVDF, C black and NMP in the preparation of electrode?
5. What are the sheet-edge distributed dots in the TEM image of MoTe2?
6. In Figure 1, EDS data shows that there are relatively more C in the sample of MoS2 than the
other two. Why?
7. The author explained why in the TEM images there are no single-layered nanosheet. Is it also
possible that after dilution, the exfoliated nanosheets tend to cluster due to Van der Wall
interaction? This question is also somehow related to the purity of nanosheets (see question 3).
For example, the Cl residue could exist in very small amount that the EDX data could not find it
due to resolution issue.
8. Page 10 Line 38: there is a typo: “The peak positions and the peak position…”.
9. Figure 2: please use arrows to help labeling the peaks. For 2(C), it looks like the sharp peak is
the E2g peak, which is different than the other two.
10. Figure 3: please use images with the same scale. Do all the prepared three sheet papers have
the same thickness and internal “sandwich” cross section?
11. Figure 3C: in term of the colors, it looks like the distribution of Mo and Te has a little local
difference. Is that within the error range of EDX mapping?
12. Figure 4B and 4D: how large the error bar (repeatability)?
13. Figure 4B and 4D: typo in the y-axis: “”aerial” should be “areal”?
14. Figure 5G: if TMD/rGO composite paper performs much better than pure rGO, why not
preparing pure TMD paper?
15. The author concluded that MoS2 performs better in capacitor and battery than the
couterparts, however no GCD and dQ/dV curves were shown for MoS2.

This manuscript reports the preparation of a collection of Mo-based 2D layered TMDs through a
superacid-based technique. Their electrochemical performance is evaluated for both
supercapacitors and sodium ion batteries. The authors identify MoS2 layered structures exhibited
the best performance in both applications. Overall, I believe this work represents an interesting
new strategy for preparing layered TMDs to systematically study the electrochemical
performance of Mo-based TMDs in supercapacitors and sodium ion batteries. However, there are
several concerns to be addressed. I would recommend acceptance of this paper after minor
revision.
1. As shown in Figure 1 (c), there are some nanoparticles on the edge of the layered MoTe2. What
are those particles?
2. Stainless steel was used as the current collector for supercapacitor application, while a free-
standing electrode configuration was adopted for sodium ion batteries. Why is that? Why is the
free-standing electrode not used for supercapacitor characterization?
3. In Figure 4 (c), the charge-discharge curve for MoS2 is not symmetric, suggesting a low
coulombic efficiency. The authors should analyze and explain that. In addition, the
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements are suggested to be performed to better
illustrate the differences among those TMDs.

The authors have addressed most of the concerns. However, there are still several issues to be
dealt with before acceptance.
1. It seems that the title for Figure 2 is not appropriate. There is no elemental analysis (mapping)
shown in Figure 2. Instead, the elemental analysis is shown in Figure 3.
2. In Figure 4, the areal capacitance was calculated and plotted. I am wondering what the loading
amount of the active material (TMDs) is for the supercapacitor test as the loading will affect the
areal capacitance.
3. In Figure 5, the title for the x-axis in (b) should be as same as that in (d), (f) and (h).
4. Table 1 should be reorganized.
5. The part for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is related to supercapacitor performance.
I would suggest this part should be placed right after the supercapacitor performance.

Appendix I
Reviewer 1.
iewer comment 1. What is the authors’ definition or criteria for “superacid” in terms of pH or
centration?
hor’s response: The authors wish to thank the reviewer for this valuable question. The
centration of the chlorosulfonic acid considered was 99 %, a density of 1.75 g ml-1 at room
perature and pH < -1, obtained from Sigma Aldrich™.
nges made: The information regarding the pH and density of the superacid have been
rporated in the revised manuscript, in page 5, lines 3 and 4).
iewer comment 2.The authors mentioned dew point of -50 C in the glove box. Is it for the
eracid solution? In addition, what would happen when pouring superacid into TMD fast?
hor’s response: The authors wish to thank the reviewer for this question. The low dew point
C) has been specifically set so that the moisture content of the air is minimal inside the glove
. Moisture in the air not only will cause damage to the glove box, a low dew point is absolutely
ential here as a superacid is being used inside the glovebox.
st addition of superacid to the TMDs may result in a strongly exothermic reaction, fumes being
erated and a thermal runoff. Therefore, to prevent this thermal hazard, the chlorosulfonic acid
dded dropwise and slowly.
nges made: Reasoning for the choice of dew point and slow addition of superacid is provided
age 5, lines 7-8 of the revised manuscript.
iewer comment 3.The authors baked the superacid treated TMD flake solutions. Did they
h the flakes before the next step in order to remove the superacid residues?
hor’s response: The authors wish to thank the reviewer for this question. Yes, washing the
eracid exfoliated flakes are absolutely essential prior to use. The flakes were washed with 1
of distilled water very cautiously inside the glovebox, and additional dilution was done with DI
er so as to decrease the solution acidity.
nges made: The washing process has also already been described, and is in lines 8-10,
e 5 of the revised manuscript and has been also highlighted in yellow.
iewer comment 4. Please state in context the functions of PVDF, C black and NMP in the
paration of electrode?
hor’s response: The author’s wish to thank the reviewer for this question. C black is used as
lps to improve the electronic conductivity. PVDF is the binder and NMP is the solvent and is
d to make the slurry in which PVDF, the active (electrode) material and C black is dissolved.
nges made: The functionality of each of the components have been provided in the revised
nuscript in page 6, line 18.
iewer comment 5. What are the sheet-edge distributed dots in the TEM image of MoTe2?
hor’s response: The author’s wish to thank the reviewer for this very pertinent question. Per
authors, there are two possibilities for those dots. They are as follows:
tly, it can be assumed that the all of the bulk MoTe2 obtained commercially may not have been
ayered from and there may have been a very small fraction in a non-layered form.
sequently, on exfoliation, these non-layered parts did not exfoliate out and are observed as
iculate “dots” in the TEM. Of course, they are a very small fraction of the entire sample and
TEM image proves that.
ondly, it is also probable that those nanoparticles are some single-layered MoTe2 that have
mpled/re-aggregated back together as this is a feature of exfoliated TMDs and a similar
earance has also been reported in the literature 1, 2.
nges made: Information regarding the explanation of the appearance of these dots have
n updated in the revised manuscript in page 9, lines 14-21.
iewer comment 6. In Figure 1, EDS data shows that there are relatively more C in the sample
oS2 than the other two. Why?
hor’s response and changes made: The authors thank the reviewer for pointing it out and
e uploaded fresh EDX data with no carbon signal in page 8 of the revised manuscript.
iewer comment 7. The author explained why in the TEM images there are no single-layered
osheet. Is it also possible that after dilution, the exfoliated nanosheets tend to cluster due to
der Wall interaction? This question is also somehow related to the purity of nanosheets (see
stion 3). For example, the Cl residue could exist in very small amount that the EDX data could
find it due to resolution issue.
hor’s response: The authors wish to thank the reviewer for this question. The reviewer is
ect; it is the tendency of exfoliated TMD nanosheets to cluster back due to the inherent van
Waal’s forces acting at short distances 3, 4. That is why exfoliation is done using very strong
rosulfonic superacid, which will help to prevent this restacking, and the authors have been
to employ this technique successfully in a previous report 5. Preliminary battery data also
w reasonably good performance indicating restacking has not occurred immediately (20
es).
X (Fig. 1), Raman spectra (Fig. 2) and elemental mapping (Fig. 3) comprehensively
onstrates the formation of exfoliated layered TMDs, with no coexisting impurity phase
sent. However, it is also entirely true that the cleaning process, even though apparently
wing no presence of Cl- ion, there can be still some trace amounts left which is below the
olution limit of the EDX.
nges made: Page 10, lines 2-3 in the revised manuscript has been updated about the trace
ount of Cl- residue.
iewer comment 8. Page 10 Line 38: there is a typo: “The peak positions and the peak
ition…”.
hor response and changes made: The authors apologize for the error and have corrected
mistake, in line 18, page 10 of the revised manuscript.
iewer comment 9. Figure 2: please use arrows to help labeling the peaks. For 2(C), it looks
the sharp peak is the E2g peak, which is different than the other two.
ponse: The authors wish to thank the reviewer for this question. Per the suggestion of the
ewer, the peaks which were confusing have been designated with arrows, and the figure has
n updated in the revised manuscript in page 10.
o, the A1g peak undergoes some broadening in MoTe2 samples, which have been previously
orted6. The sharpness of the peaks in the Raman depend upon which mode is Raman active,
in this case, it is observed that the in-plane vibrational mode i.e. the E2g is significantly more
man active7.
nges made: The modified Raman spectra figure has been provided in the revised manuscript
age 10.
iewer comment 10. Figure 3: please use images with the same scale. Do all the prepared
e sheet papers have the same thickness and internal “sandwich” cross section?
hor’s response and changes made: The authors wish to thank the reviewer for this question.
, all the sheets have the comparable thicknesses and a similar “sandwich” like consistent
s-section.
of the images in Figure 3 have a 10 um scale bar. From this, the reviewer can see that the
kness of the sheets are comparable with one other. As with any layered, packed structure of
nature, it is difficult/impossible to get them exactly the same.
iewer comment 11. Figure 3C: in term of the colors, it looks like the distribution of Mo and
has a little local difference. Is that within the error range of EDX mapping?
hor’s response: Yes, this local difference is within the error range of the EDX mapping.
iewer comment 12. Figure 4B and 4D: how large the error bar (repeatability)?
hor’s response: The authors thank the reviewer for this question. The repeatability is this
e was within ± 2%, experiments in triplicate were consistently agreeable.
iewer comment 13. Figure 4B and 4D: typo in the y-axis: “”aerial” should be “areal”?
hor’s response and changes made: The authors apologize for the error and thank the
ewer for pointing it out. The typo has been corrected in the updated figures 4B and 4D in page
of the revised manuscript.
iewer comment 14. Figure 5G: if TMD/rGO composite paper performs much better than pure
, why not preparing pure TMD paper?
hor’s response: The authors wish to thank the reviewer for this question. The role of rGO is
fold: to significantly improve the electronic conductivity of bare TMDs and to enhance the
ctural integrity of bare TMDs as a composite.
tly, TMDs inherently have low electronic conductivities and so application of pure TMD papers
not yield practical results in a battery. Therefore, introduction of rGO is necessary to achieve
reciable conductivities8.
ondly, the exfoliated TMDs tend to cluster/clump after a number of cycles due to the
version reaction occurring and lose their sheet-like properties3. Therefore, rGO is used to
e a composite as it acts as support for the TMDs and helps to relief stress during the
rcalation process9.
vious work by this same group have comprehensively demonstrated the advantage of using
as a composite along with exfoliated TMDs5, 10.
nges made: Information regarding the use of rGO have been added in page 17, lines 13-16
he revised manuscript.
iewer comment 15.The author concluded that MoS2 performs better in capacitor and battery
n the counterparts, however no GCD and dQ/dV curves were shown for MoS2.
hor’s response: The author’s thank the reviewer for this question. The figure is provided here
he reviewer’s reference.
S2 paper provides a first cycle desodiation (charge) capacity of 468.83.21 mAh g -1. In figure
it is observed that certain peaks, especially at 0.8 V, 0.9 V and 1.74 V disappear after the first
e, which indicate the formation of solid electrolyte interface layer. An insertion peak can be
erved in the second cycle around 1.16 V, whereas the extraction peak is around 1.32 V. The
ectories of the galvanostatic charge-discharge curve and the dQ/dV curves are similar to the
er TMD composite papers.
nges made: The first and the second cycle GCD and dQ/dV curves for MoS2, along with the
lanation, have been updated in page 15 of the revised manuscript.
Reviewer 2.
iewer comment 1. As shown in Figure 1 (c), there are some nanoparticles on the edge of
layered MoTe2. What are those particles?
hor’s response: The authors wish to thank the reviewer for the question. Per the authors,
e can be 2 possibilities of these nanoparticles that are observed. Firstly, it is possible that not
f the bulk MoTe2 obtained commercially was in the layered form and a small fraction of it was
non-layered bulk form, as a result the superacid based exfoliation process was unable to
liate out that non-layered part. This non-exfoliated part is observed as the nanoparticles.
ondly, it may be also entirely possible that some of the exfoliated single layered MoTe 2 has
acked back and is observed in the form of discrete nanoparticles.
nges made: Information regarding the explanation of the appearance of these dots have
n updated in the revised manuscript in page 9, lines 14-21.
iewer comment 2. Stainless steel was used as the current collector for supercapacitor
lication, while a free-standing electrode configuration was adopted for sodium ion batteries.
y is that? Why is the free-standing electrode not used for supercapacitor characterization?
hor’s response: The authors wish to thank the reviewer for this question. For battery
lication, a free-standing electrode was used as this arrangement facilitated optimum
ormance, according to previous reports by the authors5, 10. Also, for battery application, a
pact CR2032 coin cell was used in which a free-standing electrode could be kept in place
out it shifting and disrupting the proper functioning of the cell.
ever, in the 3-electrode setup that has been used for supercapacitor application, it is
essary that a current collector is used, which also acts as a support. The set-up of the 3-
trode system is such that the electrode needs to be supported by a clip and a free standing
trode’s structural integrity was compromised under the tensile stress from the clip. Hence, a
nless steel current collector was used during this project.
o, we have determined experimentally that the stainless steel does not contribute to the
acitance in any appreciable way, moreover the supercapacitor performance was a qualitative
ermination of which TMD performed better and so the set-up does not really affect the
damental result (MoS2 > MoSe2 > MoTe2 in aqueous environment) of this manuscript.
nges made: The reasoning behind the usage of stainless steel current collector have been
ed in page 7, lines 1-3 of the revised manuscript.
iewer comment 3. In Figure 4 (c), the charge-discharge curve for MoS2 is not symmetric,
gesting a low coulombic efficiency. The authors should analyze and explain that. In addition,
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements are suggested to be performed to
er illustrate the differences among those TMDs.
hor’s response: The authors with to thank the reviewer for this question. It is true that the
S2 discharge curve in the 3-electrode setup is not symmetric, however, as pointed out before,
3 electrode setup was just to qualitatively test the performance of these materials and confirm
results obtained with the battery (coin cell).
impedance spectra was performed in 1M Na2SO4 electrolyte to maintain consistency and the
uist plot shows that for the three materials studied, the semi-circle, at the high-frequency
on, is attributed to pseudocapacitive and double-layer (EDL) processes11. Importantly, one
that may contribute towards the fast-charge faradaic processes for TMDs is the fact that such
cies possesses different oxidation states12. Thus, the capacitance may be a combination of
L and faradaic charge storage processes. The equivalent circuit, per Tilak et al is provided
w 13.
m the circuit above, it is possible to obtain the contributions by each parameter i.e. bulk
ivalent series resistance of the solution (Resr), charge transfer resistance (Rct), capacitance of
electric double layer (CPE EDL) and the capacitance related to the pseudocapacitive reactions

Appendix I
iewer comments
iewer comment 1. It seems that the title for Figure 2 is not appropriate. There is no elemental
lysis (mapping) shown in Figure 2. Instead, the elemental analysis is shown in Figure 3.
hor’s response and changes made: The authors wish to thank the reviewer for this
gestion and Figure 2 (and 3) have been updated accordingly in the revised manuscript.
iewer comment 2. In Figure 4, the areal capacitance was calculated and plotted. I am
dering what the loading amount of the active material (TMDs) is for the supercapacitor test
he loading will affect the areal capacitance.
hor response: The effective mass loading on the electrodes for the supercapacitor
asurements are usually 1mg cm-2 and because of the coating uniformity, the variation of
ing across samples is not more than ± 2 – 4 %.
iewer comment 3. In Figure 5, the title for the x-axis in (b) should be as same as that in (d),
nd (h).
hor response and changes made: The authors wish to thank the reviewer for this valuable
gestion and the figure (figure 6 in the revised manuscript) has been modified accordingly.
iewer comment 4. Table 1 should be reorganized.
hor response and changes made:
iewer comment 5: The part for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is related to
ercapacitor performance. I would suggest this part should be placed right after the
ercapacitor performance.
hor response and changes made: The authors thank the reviewer for this valuable
gestion and the figure has been moved, and figure numbers have been updated in the revised
nuscript.
