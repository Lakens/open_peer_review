Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
In the manuscript, which I see already went through a round of reviews in another journal, the
authors present a novel study that compares and contrasts dental evolution in two mammalian
groups, one extant (Ctenodactylidae, rodents) and one extinct (Mesotheriidae, notoungulates). I
read this manuscript with interest and I think it offers a refreshing take on attempting to dissect,
from an ontogenetic standpoint, patterns of variation in dental evolution, particularly relating to
hypselodonty. I very much agree with the authors closing statement (ln413) underscoring the
importance of ontogeny, and I think these data represent a highly valuable addition to the
literature.
Overall, I think this is a very well presented study, and I have only minor comments and
suggestions. Mainly, these comments relate to improving the clarity of some expressions.
Ln55: ‘represents’, not ‘represent’
ln61: It is not clear to me what “paeodomorphic to peramorphic” refers to – use of ‘to’ appears to
suggest a shift, or directional change, but unclear from what to what (i.e. variation within groups
or between groups). I would modify this sentence slightly to improve clarity.
Ln62: I would use “variation in” rather than “variations of”
Ln65: “due to” rather than “because of”
Ln66: word missing between “mammals” and “prolonging”
Ln88: replace “with” with “to”
Ln104: insert comma after “apparatus”
Ln110: unusual or uncommon in other ungulates?
Ln114: replace “or” with “and”
Ln117: I would use “similar” rather than “comparable” – any two things can be comparable
Ln118: “evolved” rather than “evolve”
Ln124: replaced “was evidenced in” with “has been documented”
Ln131: perhaps it is more accurate to write “mammals displaying convergent features” or similar,
rather than “convergent mammals”
Ln145: please provide the basic information on sampling for the reader in the main text – how
many specimens were photographed, how many juveniles vs adults did the samples contain? I
appreciate this information may have been moved to reduce word count in a previous
submission, but it would benefit the reader here.
Ln145: I would suggest to please include the citations for the literature from which data were
taken in the main body of the article rather than in a supplementary information table. The reason
for this is that doing so will provide the authors of those earlier studies with the citation they
deserve in recognition for their work in generating novel data.
Ln147: do the authors mean functional integration rather than morphological integration?
(thinking for example of genetic vs morphological integration)
Ln150: it might be worth inserting, “in a standardized manner”
Ln159: is it a ratio, or a single value? A ratio would be expressed in the form of 4:3, whereas this
appears to be a division of two values to produce a single value of D, as illustrated in Fig. 2?
Ln173: it’s a little unclear how “relative spatial arrangements” were assessed in the context of the
IC model? This seems to suggest that the molars would shift in position to one another in the
sequence, rather than differ in their relative size (as measured using M1/M2 and so on, following
Kavanagh et al 2007)
Ln219 and 222: I think it is better not to use ‘near significant’, the result is significant, or it isn’t.
Ln270: might be helpful for the reader to be precise here – what are the “inherent developmental
constraints” here
Ln294: “heterochronic development” do you rather mean a heterochronic shift in development?
3
Ln303: “another” not “an other”
Ln404: what is “close function”?
Ln407: delete “from” before “dental disorders”
Ln408: I would rephrase “constraining environmental contexts” – specifically, what? Permit near-
exclusive feeding on highly abrasive foodstuffs? Or arid environments with high levels of
grit/dust/abrasive particles?
Ln412: what are ‘significant constraints’, how so defined, and different from constraints?
Figure 2 – please check presentation guidelines – the values for the y-axis may need to be
presented with periods rather than commas, i.e. 1.5 not 1,5
Figure 3. It’s not clear why the dashed green line denoting paedomorphosis is straight in part A
and curved in part B?
Figure 5 caption: should be “Evidence” rather than “Evidences”

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
We have received two favorable reviews for your manuscript, and both reviewers have
emphasized that your work represents a valuable addition to the literature. Nonetheless,
reviewer 1 makes several suggestions (mostly of editorial nature) that should help to improve the
manuscript. Particularly, the comments on the figures should be addressed (replacing commas
with periods on tick labels in multiple figures). In figures 2 and 5, you also may want to consider
placing the axis labels next to (rather than above/beside) the axis to improve readability. To
facilitate that, you could have the x axis of Fig. 5 intersect with the y axis at -20 rather than zero.
Overall, this is a well-written paper that should require only minor revisions.

Dear Editors of the Royal Society Open Science,
The manuscript (RSOS-170494) entitled Ontogenetic variations and structural
adjustments in mammals evolving prolonged to continuous dental growth has been
modified according to the last comments of the first reviewer (in blue). All the minor points
concerning the writing style mentioned by the R1 have been modified throughout the text.
The figures 2, 3, 4 and 5 have been modified accordingly.
<U+25CF> The following comments of R1 have been addressed:
Ln145: please provide the basic information on sampling for the reader in the main text –
how many specimens were photographed, how many juveniles vs adults did the samples
contain? I appreciate this information may have been moved to reduce word count in a
previous submission, but it would benefit the reader here.
Ln145: I would suggest to please include the citations for the literature from which data were
aken in the main body of the article rather than in a supplementary information table. The
eason for this is that doing so will provide the authors of those earlier studies with the
citation they deserve in recognition for their work in generating novel data.
Precisions concerning details on samples and the publications used for the study (to
complement our sample) have been added (l.42-43, and 47).
Ln147: do the authors mean functional integration rather than morphological integration?
thinking for example of genetic vs morphological integration).
No. We do mean morphological integration (and developmental integration).
Ln159: is it a ratio, or a single value?
Ok. We removed “ratio” (l.163).
Ln173: it’s a little unclear how “relative spatial arrangements” were assessed in the context
of the IC model?
Ok. This has been changed into “relative size arrangements”.
Ln270: might be helpful for the reader to be precise here – what are the “inherent
developmental constraints” here
Ln404: what is “close function”?
These part of sentences have been removed to avoid confusions and speculations.
Ln412: what are ‘significant constraints’…?
This has been changed into “important ontogenetic and structural constraints” (l.414-415).
We are very grateful to the reviewers and the editor for their last comments and their
suggestions, which have allowed us to improve the quality of our paper.
With our most sincere regards,
