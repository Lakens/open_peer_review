The authors consider a sympatric neutral model of evolution where organisms are characterized
by their phenotype on a finite phenotype space. Three types of reproduction schemes were
studied: sexual assortative, sexual with random partners and asexual. In all cases offspring are
generated with phenotypes within the parents range plus/minus a mutational interval. The
model also incorporates the possibility of global extinction: not only the generations are non-
overlapping (all parents die after reproducing) but there is competition for resources (organisms
cannot be too close in phenotype space, otherwise one of them dies) and there is random death at
rate “delta”. The inclusion of an external (and uniform) death rate allows for the modeling of
non-equilibrium dynamics, i.e., for the possibility of global extinctions. The model displays two
types of phase transitions: survival-extinction (a non-equilibrium, continuous transition) and
Direct Percolation (DP, an equilibrium transition that takes place in the survival regime).
The paper is very well written. The introduction provides a nice review of previous neutral
models and motivates the present study where the explicit asymmetry between local dispersal
during birth and uniform death is imposed. The model is clearly explained and so are the results.
I think this is an interesting contribution to the literature of neutral models and I recommend its
publication in the RSOS. I have, however, a number of comments and suggestions the authors
should consider:
Major point:
Although sympatric speciation is one of the main motivations of the paper, the type of initial
conditions used in the simulations seem to be quite unrealistic, since it consists of individuals
randomly placed in the phenotype space. I don’t see how a population with such high diversity
could come about. Also, the clustering that follows (due to assortative mating and/or local
dispersal) can hardly be called speciation. All the variation is already there at time zero (as if the
species were already there), only not yet separated from each other. Speciation would be a single
species (one cluster) giving rise to other clusters, in a branching (not clustering) process. I am not
saying clustering in not interesting, only that the initial condition should be justified. The model
also reminds me of the problem of the ‘Instability of the sexual continuum’ studied by A.J. Noest,
Proc. R. Soc. Lond.B (1997) 264, 1389.
It would be interesting to study (maybe in a future publication) the same dynamics but starting
from a condition of low diversity, where all individuals are very similar. This would happen, for
instance, in the colonization of a new area by a small group of individuals. Under what
conditions diversity would increase and the initial cluster would break up into separate clusters?
In this regard I would like to point out the work by Derrida and Higgs from the early 90’s:
P. G. Higgs and B. Derrida. Stochastic models for species formation in evolving populations.
Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General, 24(17):L985, September 1991.
In this paper the authors demonstrate that it is possible to generate sympatric speciation starting
from a population of identical organisms, but requires infinitely large genomes. I have myself
revisited this model in a recent paper considering finite genomes:
M.A.M. de Aguiar. Speciation in the Derrida-Higgs model with finite genomes and spatial
populations. Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical. https://doi.org/10.1088/1751-
8121/aa5701 (2017).
(there is no need to cite these papers, I just wanted to point them out).

Comments:
1 - The fact that the number of clusters is maximum right after the the threshold delta_c is very
interesting. Populations with a death rate just below the critical value, and therefore the most
unstable, have the largest number of species. I wonder what the consequences of this are.
2 - It doesn’t surprise me that the transition characterized by R=1 should not coincide with
delta_c, since it should generally occur at a smaller value of delta, in the survival regime. This is
true also for the random mating case, except when the curve does not cross the R=1 line.
Minor points:
1 - It would be good to spell out the relation between the symbolic processes A -> 2A, A+A-> A
and A->0 and the birth-death events in the model. Are they reproduction, competition and
death?
2 - In figure 8 I would expect the curve to depend on the death rate. Does it? The simulations
were performed with what value of delta?

Comments to Authors
In this contribution, the authors discuss various phase transitions in a neutral model of
speciation, defined on a two-dimensional morphospace. As opposed to earlier work of the
4
authors where the death probability was time-dependent and could vary from organism to
organism, in this instantiation of the model the death probability is uniform per individual, more
closely representing the assumptions behind the directed percolation conjecture that all
continuous transitions of a scalar order parameter with a unique absorbing state in dimension d
belong to the DP universality class.
In previous work, the authors examined the DP transition as a function of the parameter that
controls the change in morphometric space at each generation. Here, this parameter is held
constant (three different constants), and instead the dependence on the death probability is
investigated. The authors find two different phase transitions: a DP transition in genealogical
space, where a spanning cluster is one that does not end in extinction, and an ordinary
percolation transition in morphospace where bonds are determined via mating. They also find
that for simulations where each organism gives rise to two others (fitness f=2), there is no
percolation in morphospace where the metric is the morphological character rather than mating
distance, as such a transition requires a higher fitness.
They conclude that it is possible to encounter groups of related and mating organisms (what one
would call a “species” here) that yet are very different in morphological characters, and therefore
that using morphology alone as taxonomic criterion can be dangerous. Many of these conclusions
are similar to statements from earlier papers (for example the de Aguilar papers), who had
shown that so-called “ring species” can emerge in a completely neutral model.
While I like the paper in general, and appreciate the clear exposition of assumptions and results, I
am somewhat less enthusiastic about the strength and novelty of results. While earlier work on
phase transitions in neutral models have addressed some of the issues touched upon here, they
did not do so in the context of DP theory. However, what aspects of DP theory are important to
the work shown here is not clear. For example, whether or not a model is in the DP class seems to
be less of an importance, as the violation of spatio-temporal disorder (in earlier work) does not
seem to have affected the presence of a phase transition. The absence of a transition under
random mating (thus losing the short-distance assumption) has been noted before. The transition
in morphospace is not of the directed type, and only occurs for bond percolation where the bonds
occur via mating. Their relation to the DP transition is also not clear.
I would like to see, therefore, a broader discussion of what precisely the findings in this paper
teach us about the formation of species clusters in nature (assuming that they form as here
neutrally). In which way is the universality conjecture important (if it is at all)? What are the
findings that go beyond what has already been shown in previous work (of these authors and
others)? How might adding selection change the results shown here?
I believe that giving some answers to these questions will increase the value of this contribution
to a less mathematically inclined reader.

or point:

ulations seem to be quite unrealistic, since it consists of individuals randomly placed in the phenotype space. I
’t see how a population with such high diversity could come about. Also, the clustering that follows (due to

not saying clustering in not interesting, only that the initial condition should be justified.
agree that the initial uniform distribution of organisms does not map clearly onto a model of sympatric
iation. The initial conditions used here were chosen to minimize the transient period that it takes the
ulation to reach the steady state. Initial conditions involving a small number of organisms were used in
model during a separate investigation of lineage branching; that work, cited in the revised manuscript,
wed similar behavior to the results presented here. Clustering and phase transition behavior occur
rdless of the initial conditions of the system (i.e., whether we started with two individuals or 300); indeed,
time point could be regarded as an initial condition for subsequent generations. Text has been added in
Methods section to elaborate more on the choice of initial conditions.
model also reminds me of the problem of the ‘Instability of the sexual continuum’ studied by A.J. Noest, Proc.
oc. Lond.B (1997) 264, 1389.
nk you for recommending the Noest paper, which provided us with new insight in thinking about our
el in the context of incipient speciation in a sexual continuum. The speculation on how populations might
amically behave in filling ecological niches in the beginning stages of a speciation process is particularly
vant. We have cited this paper and mentioned these points in the revised manuscript.
ould be interesting to study (maybe in a future publication) the same dynamics but starting from a condition of
diversity, where all individuals are very similar. This would happen, for instance, in the colonization of a new
by a small group of individuals. Under what conditions diversity would increase and the initial cluster would
k up into separate clusters?
oted above, low diversity initial conditions have been used in the investigation of lineage branching in this
el, and that study has been mentioned in the revised text. In general, the phase transition and branching
avior seems to be minimally affected by the initial conditions.
is regard I would like to point out the work by Derrida and Higgs from the early 90’s:
. Higgs and B. Derrida. Stochastic models for species formation in evolving populations. Journal of Physics A:
hematical and General, 24(17):L985, September 1991.

idering finite genomes:

sics A: Mathematical and Theoretical. https://doi.org/10.1088/1751-8121/aa5701 (2017).
re is no need to cite these papers, I just wanted to point them out).
nk you for suggesting these papers. The method used to distinguish whether a speciation event occurred
ot is interesting, especially with the addition of the spatial constraint that significantly reduced the
ome size needed for a speciation event. Since we do not have explicit genetics in our model, it is not
ediately clear how we could implement an easy distinction of a speciation event, but it is definitely a
blem that merits continued research for us. In this sense, we have included a few sentences about the need
another rule to be able to distinguish reproductively isolated groups in our model and cited these works.
ments:
he fact that the number of clusters is maximum right after the threshold delta_c is very interesting. Populations
a death rate just below the critical value, and therefore the most unstable, have the largest number of species. I
der what the consequences of this are.
believe this behavior might have something to do with the small population size coupled with the
regated clustering behavior that occurs at and near the critical point of the phase transition.
t doesn’t surprise me that the transition characterized by R=1 should not coincide with delta_c, since it should
erally occur at a smaller value of delta, in the survival regime. This is true also for the random mating case,
pt when the curve does not cross the R=1 line.
, we agree that it is not surprising that the randomly distributed population is not at the critical value,
cially since we observe highly aggregated, clustering behavior at the critical value. The R measure simply
ws that the population structure does change depending on the location in parameter space, which might
e implications for the forward-in-time directed percolation cluster.
or points:
t would be good to spell out the relation between the symbolic processes A -> 2A, A+A-> A and A->0 and the
-death events in the model. Are they reproduction, competition and death?
, these processes do correspond to reproduction, competition, and death. We have clarified this in the
sed manuscript.
n figure 8 I would expect the curve to depend on the death rate. Does it? The simulations were performed with

igure 8, the death rage is held constant at 1% (see Methods section, immediately before section IIA, and
re caption). The curve would change for different values of the death rate. However, here, the intent was
etermine whether the continuous morphospace could be “filled”, with the intention of characterizing a 2D
colation transition based on mate choice (bond percolation) or a space filling (continuum) percolation
sition. As it turned out, even if we the decreased the death rate to be extremely small (1% in this case),
organisms would never organize in such a way that a continuous cluster would span the morphospace for
ness of 2.
iewer 2 Comments:
is contribution, the authors discuss various phase transitions in a neutral model of speciation, defined on a two-
ensional morphospace. As opposed to earlier work of the authors where the death probability was time-
endent and could vary from organism to organism, in this instantiation of the model the death probability is
orm per individual, more closely representing the assumptions behind the directed percolation conjecture that all
inuous transitions of a scalar order parameter with a unique absorbing state in dimension d belong to the DP
ersality class.
revious work, the authors examined the DP transition as a function of the parameter that controls the change in
phometric space at each generation. Here, this parameter is held constant (three different constants), and instead
dependence on the death probability is investigated. The authors find two different phase transitions: a DP
sition in genealogical space, where a spanning cluster is one that does not end in extinction, and an ordinary
olation transition in morphospace where bonds are determined via mating.
y also find that for simulations where each organism gives rise to two others (fitness f=2), there is no percolation
orphospace where the metric is the morphological character rather than mating distance, as such a transition
ires a higher fitness.
y conclude that it is possible to encounter groups of related and mating organisms (what one would call a
cies” here) that yet are very different in morphological characters, and therefore that using morphology alone as
nomic criterion can be dangerous. Many of these conclusions are similar to statements from earlier papers (for
mple the de Aguilar papers), who had shown that so-called “ring species” can emerge in a completely neutral
el.
le I like the paper in general, and appreciate the clear exposition of assumptions and results, I am somewhat less
usiastic about the strength and novelty of results. While earlier work on phase transitions in neutral models have
essed some of the issues touched upon here, they did not do so in the context of DP theory.
ever, what aspects of DP theory are important to the work shown here is not clear.
example, whether or not a model is in the DP class seems to be less of an importance, as the violation of spatio-
poral disorder (in earlier work) does not seem to have affected the presence of a phase transition.
cite a number of papers that investigate clustering in neutral models, but we are not aware of any works
specifically investigate phase transitions in such models.
have revised the manuscript in order to clarify the importance of identifying DP. The particular
amics of the transition from extinction to survival may be key in understanding warning signs of
ulation collapse and identifying indicators of population recovery following mass extinction. Also, while
rder does not appear to destroy the DP transition, different underlying birth-death dynamical processes
ead to different universality class other than DP; these might behave differently in the neighborhood of a
sition to population collapse.
absence of a transition under random mating (thus losing the short-distance assumption) has been noted before.
transition in morphospace is not of the directed type, and only occurs for bond percolation where the bonds
r via mating. Their relation to the DP transition is also not clear.
do cite the work of Young et al., and others, showing that emergent clustering only occurs in the presence
local birth\dispersion process. We have emphasized this even more strongly in the revised manuscript.
e that the emergence of clustering in such models is not identical to a phase transition in the statistical
sics sense. We would not refer to the absence of clustering under random mating as the absence of a phase
sition, since this would confuse the idea of clustering with the more technical sense of a phase transition.
re is no a priori reason why two phase transitions occurring in the same system should be related.
ertheless, the spatial clusters in the equilibrium bond percolation transition and the nonequilibrium DP
sition from extinction to survival co-occur in this model. The question of how the structure of the bond
ters might change if the nonequilibrium transition belonged to a class other than DP is an interesting one,
ugh beyond the scope of this work.
re broadly, there is no a priori reason why all systems that exhibit clustering as a result of short-range
ractions should exhibit phase transitions of the same universality class. In other words, the universal
uirement that local interactions must be present in order to obtain clustering behavior will not necessarily
onto the universality class of a phase transition that the system undergoes. We highlight these issues in
revised manuscript.
uld like to see, therefore, a broader discussion of what precisely the findings in this paper teach us about the
ation of species clusters in nature (assuming that they form as here neutrally).
have added text to the Discussion that explicitly addresses the nature of clustering in our model and its
tion to speciation. See also our response above to the other reviewer.
which way is the universality conjecture important (if it is at all)?
our response above about the importance of identifying DP in the model; this is expanded upon in the
sed Discussion.
at are the findings that go beyond what has already been shown in previous work (of these authors and others)?
might adding selection change the results shown here?
novelty of the present work is the demonstration of multiple simultaneous phase transitions in the model,
the implications of this finding for the analysis of taxonomic diversity. We have clarified this in the
sed text.
ing selection would likely contribute significant “spatial” disorder within the morphospace, and might
upt the DP transition; this is a current topic of investigation in our group. We have addressed this point
he revised manuscript as well.
lieve that giving some answers to these questions will increase the value of this contribution to a less
hematically inclined reader.
agree that clarification of these issues will make the paper more accessible, and hope that our revised text
mplishes that task!
