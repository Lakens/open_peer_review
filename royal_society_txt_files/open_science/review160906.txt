The manuscript presents several results on quantum algorithms to simulate or solve systems of
equations where the linear map involves circulant matrices, or circulant like matrices. The
methods involves modifications of prior art for simulating sparse Hamiltonians or sparse systems
of equations. Overall the presentation is clear with arguments supplemented with circuit
diagrams and all references clearly cited in the appropriate manner. The main new result is that
for particular structured systems, even dense Hamiltonians can be simulated in real time (or
dense systems of equations). Generically this is not possible due to prior lower bound argument.
The results herein could be useful to others working in quantum algorithms particular to those
interesting in simulating physical systems with couplings that have translational invariance (but
long range) so that methods to solve dense systems are needed. For these reasons I recommend
for publication but after the following issues have been addressed.
1. The number of Given’s rotations (unitary matrices that act non-trivially on two dimensional
subspaces) needed to decompose an arbitrary Unitary in N dimensions scales like N^2 so I would
state “fewer than N^2 two level unitary matrices.”
2. In the statement of Lemma 1 it would help to include the upper index on j (i.e. the number of
terms in the sum of the operator M). Just below it is assumed that the two registers have L qubits
and this implies that the maximum number of terms in the sum M is 2^L, which must be the case
for the chosen circulate unitary V.
3. Below Theorem 2 it is stated “To take an extreme but illustrative example, when <U+039B>_k = 1, k <U+0338>=
N/2 and <U+039B>_N/2=0 …”, does this illustrative example fit with the assumption that the sum of the
c_j’s is 1 and they are all positive? It’s not clear to me that this would fit the assumptions.
4. Above Fig. 2 “…elements are on odd-numbered sites…” should be “…elements on odd-
numbered sites…”
5. Authors should comment that throughout they assume that the target operators are natively
expressed in an n qubit basis. Many of the results of Hamiltonian simulation carry over even
when the dimension is not a power of two (because you can embed in a larger Hilbert space
which is a power of 2) However, some of the transformations here may suffer under such an
embedding, e.g. the permutation on the Hankel matrix to make it Toeplitz could be more
complex than simply performing local bit flips.
6. Sec. 4, paragraph 2. It is stated that there is a direct method to implement the diagonal unitary
when the diagonal elements are known. The authors should comment that in general even
implementing diagonal unitaries scales like O(N log N) (see e.g. Bullock and Markov, Quantum
Information & Computation, vol 4, no 1, 027-047 (2004)).
7. Sec. 5. The way this section is written it seems that the proof is just the HHL algorithm. It
would help if the proof were explicit in where it uses the HHL algorithm and where things differ.
E.g. in step 2, the operator U=e^{i 2 pi C} is not necessarily unitary since C is not necessarily
Hermitian so there were be error in the simulation (as stated later in this section). Also in step 3
the ancilla qubit state is missing and the output state is missing vector labels for the ancilla. There
should be some more discussion about the nature of the controlled rotation in step 3. In HHL the
complexity of the algorithm scales with the square of the matrix sparsity but in this application
the authors are assuming even dense ciculant matrices can be implemented efficiently from the
arguments in previous sections. There should be a discussion of this important point.
3
8. In the vibrational analysis application do we know that the oracle step (to create the uniform
superposition state with elements from the circulant matrices) can be efficiently done? It seems
that an efficient oracle requires some special structure in the coefficients c_j. It could be that for
the cases where you have such special structure, then there are also efficient classical algorithms
to solve this system. In any case I think the sentence “ If all three conditions are satisfied, we have
an exponential speed-up compared to classical computation. “ should be softened or maybe a
fourth condition added that the physical couplings have sufficient structure to allow for an
efficient oracle construction.
9. In the conclusions I recommend the authors spend some more time discussing the provisio that
the simulation of dense circulant matrices only works if the oracle can be constructed efficiently.
As the authors state in Sec. 2 this requires either access to QRAM with O(N) resources, or some
special structure to the coefficients of the matrices. This is particularly important because the
authors emphasize the application to science and engineering, and given that we will have a
quantum computer no-one is also going to give us oracles, we will need to construct them.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This manuscript describes quantum algorithms for operations involving circulant matrices
(multiplication, inverses, and Hamiltonian evolution). This is a nice addition to the literature on
the subject, but there are some minor problems with the manuscript as given.
First, it is a completely unnecessary assumption for the entries c_j to be non-negative. It is easy to
allow for negative or complex entries, and the manuscript mentions this generalization below
equation (4). But then in section 7 there is a lengthy discussion of the case of negative entries, as
if that were a significant difficulty (and ignoring the fact that it had already been addressed).
4
Some other minor problems are:
1) The second sentence of the Introduction is very strangely worded, particularly where it says
that a quantum computer provides "the ultimate computational results". That does not make
sense, because a quantum computer should provide the same computational results as a classical
computer. The difference is that the quantum computer can (in some cases) provide the results
more rapidly.
2) The Introduction is inconsistent, because it discusses the problem of implementing linear
operations, then gives as examples Shor's and Grover's algorithms. Those algorithms are to find
the answer to a classically posed question, they are not to perform a specified linear operation.
3) Lemma 1 is cited as being from reference [9], but does not appear there.
4) Just below the statement of Lemma 1 it says that addition would require O(log^2(N))
operations. That isn't right, the complexity of addition is proportional to log(N). This problem is
also in Theorems 2 and 3.
5) There is inconsistency in the notation on page 3. In the lemma, m is used for the number of
qubits in the ancilla, M is used for the operation, W_j is used for the unitaries, and alpha_j for the
weightings. Elsewhere in the page L is the number of qubits, C is the operation, V_j are the
unitaries, and c_j are the weightings. If different notation is used from the Lemma, the
differences in the notation should be explicitly stated.
6) Below Theorem 2 it says that the complexity is inversely proportional to p, but it is inversely
proportional to the square root of p.
7) In the beginning of section 4 the first page is summarizing the procedure from reference [9].
That needs to be made clear, because the way it is written makes it look like it is original to this
manuscript.
8) In equation (26) it only has n*Omega, but the second derivative would lead to a factor of the
square of that.
9) The English usage is poor in a few places:
* Just below Theorem 2, "diagonalization form" should be "diagonal form".
* In several places in the manuscript, the wording "equals to" is used where it should say "is equal
to".
* Towards the end of the proof of Theorem 3, the wording "numbers of one or two-qubit gates" is
used. The words "numbers of" should not be there.

This manuscript describes quantum algorithms for operations involving circulant matrices

First, it is a completely unnecessary assumption for the entries c_j to be non-negative. It is easy to

Some other minor problems are:
1) The second sentence of the Introduction is very strangely worded, particularly where it says

Title: Efficient quantum circuits for dense circulant and circulant-like operators
Dear Editor,
We would like to thank the referees for providing detailed comments and very constructive suggestions.
We have revised the manuscript in light of their reviews. Listed below are specific changes we have
made in response to the detailed points raised by the reviewers.
Referee #1:
• The number of Given’s rotations (unitary matrices that act non-trivially on two dimensional
subspaces) needed to decompose an arbitrary Unitary in N dimensions scales like N^2 so I would
state “fewer than N^2 two level unitary matrices.”
The following sentence is added in the introduction: “In general, the number of two-level gates (i.e.
unitary matrices acting non-trivially on two dimensional subspaces) needed to decompose an arbitrary
unitary in $N$ dimensions scales as $O(N^2)$.”
• In the statement of Lemma 1 it would help to include the upper index on j (i.e. the number of
terms in the sum of the operator M). Just below it is assumed that the two registers have L qubits
and this implies that the maximum number of terms in the sum M is 2^L, which must be the case
for the chosen circulate unitary V.
We have now included the upper index on j in Lemma 1, denoted as J. We also added some explanatory
text in Section 1 and later in Section 4.
• Below Theorem 2 it is stated “To take an extreme but illustrative example, when <U+039B>_k = 1, k <U+0338>= N/2
and <U+039B>_N/2=0 …”, does this illustrative example fit with the assumption that the sum of the c_j’s
is 1 and they are all positive? It’s not clear to me that this would fit the assumptions.
We have used a different example where <U+039B>_k=cos(2pk/N), which fits the assumptions.
• Above Fig. 2 “…elements are on odd-numbered sites…” should be “…elements on odd-
numbered sites…”
The sentence has been corrected.
• Authors should comment that throughout they assume that the target operators are natively
expressed in an n qubit basis. Many of the results of Hamiltonian simulation carry over even
when the dimension is not a power of two (because you can embed in a larger Hilbert space
which is a power of 2) However, some of the transformations here may suffer under such an
embedding, e.g. the permutation on the Hankel matrix to make it Toeplitz could be more complex
than simply performing local bit flips.
We have added the following sentences on Page 3: “Unless stated otherwise, we assume that $N =
2^{L}$, where $L$ is an integer. If $N$ is not a power of two, we will need to embed the system into a
larger Hilbert space whose dimension is a power of two. On the other hand, it is also convenient to simply
discretise practical problems using powers of two. … Note that when $N$ is not a power of two, it may
take additional $O(\log N)$ ancillary qubits to implement the “mod N” operation in select(V), for
example by first subtracting $N$ from $k-j$ and then using the sign qubit to control the “mod N”
operation.”
On Page 7, we added the following discussion on the Hankel matrix permutation: “Note that when $N$ is
not a power of two, we need to be careful with the embedding when mapping a circulant matrix into a
Hankel matrix. The subspace $\mathrm{span}\{\ket{0},\ldots, \ket{N-1}\}$ in the implementation of
circulant matrices corresponds to the subspace $\mathrm{span}\{\ket{2^L-N},\ldots,\ket{2^L-1}\}$ in
the implementation of Hankel matrices.”
• Sec. 4, paragraph 2. It is stated that there is a direct method to implement the diagonal unitary
when the diagonal elements are known. The authors should comment that in general even
implementing diagonal unitaries scales like O(N log N) (see e.g. Bullock and Markov, Quantum
Information & Computation, vol 4, no 1, 027-047 (2004)).
We added the following sentence in Section 4, paragraph 2: “In general, implementing an arbitrary
diagonal unitary requires up to $O(N \log N)$ one- or two-qubit gates \cite{bullock2003smaller}.”
• Sec. 5. The way this section is written it seems that the proof is just the HHL algorithm. It would
help if the proof were explicit in where it uses the HHL algorithm and where things differ. E.g. in
step 2, the operator U=e^{i 2 pi C} is not necessarily unitary since C is not necessarily Hermitian
so there were be error in the simulation (as stated later in this section).
We added the following sentence: “The basic procedure is the same as the HHL algorithm
~\cite{harrow2009}, except that $C$ is a dense circulant matrix rather than sparse as required by the
HHL algorithm, which is summarised below.” In Section 5, we added the assumption that C is
Hermitian; a discussion on the Hermiticity of $C$ is included in Section 4 (right before Theorem 3).
• Also in step 3 the ancilla qubit state is missing and the output state is missing vector labels for
the ancilla. There should be some more discussion about the nature of the controlled rotation in
step 3. In HHL the complexity of the algorithm scales with the square of the matrix sparsity but in
this application the authors are assuming even dense circulant matrices can be implemented
efficiently from the arguments in previous sections. There should be a discussion of this important
point.
The missing ancillary qubit is now added and we also added a reference on the implementation of
controlled rotations. As the end of Section 5, we added the following sentence: “For $s$-sparse
Hamiltonians (with at most $s$ nonzero entries in any row or column), the HHL algorithm scales as
$\tilde{O}(s^2 \kappa^2 \log N/\epsilon)$~\cite{harrow2009}. In this work we extended the HHL
procedure to dense Hamiltonians with special structure and proved the scaling is independent of matrix
sparsity. This simplification stems from the efficient implementation of $\mathrm{select}(V)$ which
makes possible the decomposition of $C$ into $O(N)$ terms without introducing $O(N)$ into the
computational complexity.”
• In the vibrational analysis application do we know that the oracle step (to create the uniform
superposition state with elements from the circulant matrices) can be efficiently done? It seems
that an efficient oracle requires some special structure in the coefficients c_j. It could be that for
the cases where you have such special structure, then there are also efficient classical algorithms
to solve this system. In any case I think the sentence “ If all three conditions are satisfied, we
have an exponential speed-up compared to classical computation. “ should be softened or maybe
a fourth condition added that the physical couplings have sufficient structure to allow for an
efficient oracle construction.
We have included the efficient implementation of the oracle as the fourth condition on Page 15.
• In the conclusions I recommend the authors spend some more time discussing the provisio that
the simulation of dense circulant matrices only works if the oracle can be constructed efficiently.
As the authors state in Sec. 2 this requires either access to QRAM with O(N) resources, or some
special structure to the coefficients of the matrices. This is particularly important because the
authors emphasize the application to science and engineering, and given that we will have a
quantum computer no-one is also going to give us oracles, we will need to construct them.
At the end of paragraph 1 in the conclusion, we commented that realizing the oracle is still an obstacle in
the physical realization of our algorithm.
Reviewer: 2
• First, it is a completely unnecessary assumption for the entries c_j to be non-negative. It is easy
to allow for negative or complex entries, and the manuscript mentions this generalization below
equation (4). But then in section 7 there is a lengthy discussion of the case of negative entries, as
if that were a significant difficulty (and ignoring the fact that it had already been addressed).
We have removed the lengthy discussion on negative entries in Section 7.
• The second sentence of the Introduction is very strangely worded, particularly where it says that
a quantum computer provides "the ultimate computational results". That does not make sense,
because a quantum computer should provide the same computational results as a classical
computer. The difference is that the quantum computer can (in some cases) provide the results
more rapidly.
We have rewritten this paragraph.
• The Introduction is inconsistent, because it discusses the problem of implementing linear
operations, then gives as examples Shor's and Grover's algorithms. Those algorithms are to find
the answer to a classically posed question, they are not to perform a specified linear operation.
The inappropriate examples of Shor’s and Grover’s algorithms are removed.
• Lemma 1 is cited as being from reference [9], but does not appear there.
Lemma 1 appears on the second page of Ref [9] (now Ref [7]) from Eq. (7) – Eq. (10).
• Just below the statement of Lemma 1 it says that addition would require O(log^2(N)) operations.
That isn't right, the complexity of addition is proportional to log(N). This problem is also in
Theorems 2 and 3.
The problem is fixed in the statement below Lemma 1 and also in every theorem.
• There is inconsistency in the notation on page 3. In the lemma, m is used for the number of
qubits in the ancilla, M is used for the operation, W_j is used for the unitaries, and alpha_j for
the weightings. Elsewhere in the page L is the number of qubits, C is the operation, V_j are the
unitaries, and c_j are the weightings. If different notation is used from the Lemma, the
differences in the notation should be explicitly stated.
We have added the explanatory texts in Section 1 and Section 4: by taking M=C, a_j =c_j, W_j =V_j,
J=2^L and m=L on Page 3 and By taking M = tildeU, aj = (t/r)k/k!cj1 ···cjk, Wj = W(k,j1,...,jk), J =
KN^K and m = K+KL on Page 9 to clarify how Lemma 1 is applied in these two situation.
• Below Theorem 2 it says that the complexity is inversely proportional to p, but it is inversely
proportional to the square root of p.
The statement is corrected.
• In the beginning of section 4 the first page is summarizing the procedure from reference [9].
That needs to be made clear, because the way it is written makes it look like it is original to this
manuscript.
We have rewritten the sentence as: “The basic procedure is the same as the HHL algorithm
~\cite{harrow2009}, except that $C$ is a dense circulant matrix rather than sparse as required by the
HHL algorithm, which is summarised below.”
• In equation (26) it only has n*Omega, but the second derivative would lead to a factor of the
square of that.
• The English usage is poor in a few places:* Just below Theorem 2, "diagonalization form" should
be "diagonal form".* In several places in the manuscript, the wording "equals to" is used where
it should say "is equal to".* Towards the end of the proof of Theorem 3, the wording "numbers of
one or two-qubit gates" is used. The words "numbers of" should not be there.
These problems are now fixed.
