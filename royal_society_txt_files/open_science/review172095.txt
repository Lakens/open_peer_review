This looks as if the measurements are well done and it is a paper I think biologist need to read.
You might include an example that shows significant changes in cell growth rates for magnetic
field variation of the size you see on a single shelf.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors have provided very interesting and important information concerning the effects of
the shelving and, to a lesser extent, the body of a common incubator on the ambient DC field
experienced by cultures inside it. Though for a long time the literature has had data on the
influence of incubator incubator heaters and structures on the AC fields inside them, I do not
recall as thorough an exploration of the effect of the structures on the ambient DC field. Pointing
out the effects of manufacturing processes on the structure of the stainless steel is worthwhile.
While the paper could be accepted as is, I have a couple of comments that might strengthen it:
Authors might emphasize the distinction between incubator effects on AC and DC fields and
indicate which of their references discuss which (or both) types of effect.
Authors have located the magnetometer with a precision of down to a millimeter on their finest
grid. They do not mention the separation of the three directional sensors inside the device,
3
presumably less than a millimeter. This would be a useful number, though admittedly I was
unable to find it on a quick perusal of the manufacturer's online data sheet.
Authors talk about this problem as a potential problem in CO2 incubators. They might not want
to restrict it to incubators designed for CO2 atmospheres.

Response to referees' comments and other changes
ar Editor, please find below the reviewers' comments in italics, along with our
ponses in green.
viewer 1: This looks as if the measurements are well done and it is a paper I think
logist need to read. We appreciate this comment on our work. You might include an
mple that shows significant changes in cell growth rates for magnetic field variation
he size you see on a single shelf. Indeed, we appended two more sentences at the
d of the second paragraph of the DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION section:
oreover, an example of special interest for the present work is the study by Martino et
[42] on fibrosarcoma and colorectal cancer cells […]”. We also added the following to
last paragraph of the article: “along with bearing in mind the exact location of
tures inside the incubator (even on the same shelf)”.
viewer 2: The authors have provided very interesting and important information
cerning the effects of the shelving and, to a lesser extent, the body of a common
ubator on the ambient DC field experienced by cultures inside it. Though for a long
e the literature has had data on the influence of incubator incubator heaters and
uctures on the AC fields inside them, I do not recall as thorough an exploration of the
ect of the structures on the ambient DC field. Pointing out the effects of
nufacturing processes on the structure of the stainless steel is worthwhile. We
preciate these comments on our work. While the paper could be accepted as is, I
e a couple of comments that might strengthen it:
hors might emphasize the distinction between incubator effects on AC and DC fields
d indicate which of their references discuss which (or both) types of effect. We
dified and expanded the second paragraph of our INTRODUCTION: “Mild et al. [2]
asured AC fields […]”.
hors have located the magnetometer with a precision of down to a millimeter on their
st grid. They do not mention the separation of the three directional sensors inside
device, presumably less than a millimeter. This would be a useful number, though
mittedly I was unable to find it on a quick perusal of the manufacturer's online data
et. During the time we performed our measurements; we also looked for that specific
mber and failed to find it in the datasheet. We then contacted directly the
nufacturer, repeatedly, to ask for the exact size and location of the sensors inside the
p, from whom we received no answer. What we do know is that the external
ensions of the chip containing the three sensors are 3.0 x 3.0 x 0.9 mm. Being that
re are three orthogonal sensors, at least one of them (and presumably the three of
m are similar, if not identical) must be smaller than 0.9 mm. Apart from this, the
kness of the package itself must be considered, according to drawings in the US
ent 6229200 (Fig. 8 of the patent), which refers to the type of packaging of our
sor (leadless plastic chip container (LPCC), stated in its datasheet) the die (i.e., the
e of the chip, were the actual electronics is) dimensions are roughly half those of the
ernal package, which would leave us with a die of 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.45 mm. Further, the
p includes, besides the three sensors (which consist of resistive strips of a permalloy
film), an analog multiplexer, an analog-to-digital converter and a control unit that
ndles communication with external circuitry (also found in the datasheet). All of this
rmation is, in our opinion, enough to make it reasonable to say that sensors are
bably confined to an area smaller than 1 mm 2 (the size of our smallest pixels). We
ded two sentences in this regard to the MATERIALS AND METHODS section: “The
le shows that the smallest of our pixels […]”.
hors talk about this problem as a potential problem in CO2 incubators. They might
want to restrict it to incubators designed for CO2 atmospheres. We agree
mpletely with the Referee. Hence, we deleted several instances of “CO2” in our
nuscript: the one at the end of the abstract, two in the first paragraph and one
ards the end of the INTRODUCTION (“As stated above, we suggest that […]”), and
e in the final paragraph of the article (“In summary, […]”).
her changes: Besides responding to the referees, we included the Ethics statement,
d also re-located the “Competing interests”, and the “Funding” sections (also adding
he latter one more funding source: “VEGA Grant Agency (2/0089/18) of the Slovak
public”). Several minor typos were corrected. Also, we now included the Dryad
ation of all of our raw data as instructed by Dryad administrators, here is the
porary link for the editor and the reviewers:
