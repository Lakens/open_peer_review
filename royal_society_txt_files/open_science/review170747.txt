This manuscript reports extraction of lotus fibers from lotus stems in and sodium hydroxide and
hydrogen peroxide under microwave irradiation. Effects of treatment time on microstructure and
performance of lotus fibers were discussed. This is a well-organized engineering report, which, in
other words, describes the experimental observations thoroughly. I recommend the manuscript
can be published in the journal after minor revision.
1. In 3.2 section of result and discussion, explanation why content of lignin in lotus fibers
decrease with prolonging treatment is not reasonable. Please give the reasonable explanation.
2. Please compare moisture regains of lotus fibers and other nature fibers.
3. Please explain why tensile strength increases with prolonging treatment time.
4. The English language requires improvement.
For example,
(1) All the full name of “<U+2103>” is “degree Celsius” instead of degree
(2) In 2.3 section. Change of weight between the weights should be change to change of
weight.
(3) There is no space between two words such as “fibertreated” and “thedecompostion”
(4) “80m” should be replaced by “80µm” in section 3.3.

Appendix A
Dear Editor,
Thank you for your comments to our manuscript entitled “Extraction of Lotus
Fibers from Lotus Stems under Microwave Irradiation (Re: RSOS-170747)”. We
have made update to the manuscript according to the comments from reviewers. Hope
that the revised manuscript can meet with the publishing requirement.
Sincerely yours,
Ronghui Guo
Correction according to the reviewer’s comments
Reviewer #1:
This manuscript reports extraction of lotus fibers from lotus stems in and sodium
hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide under microwave irradiation. Effects of treatment
time on microstructure and performance of lotus fibers were discussed. This is a well-
organized engineering report, which, in other words, describes the experimental
observations thoroughly. I recommend the manuscript can be published in the journal
after minor revision.
1. In 3.2 section of result and discussion, explanation why content of lignin in lotus
fibers decrease with prolonging treatment is not reasonable. Please give the
reasonable explanation.
Answer: We have added related content in 3.2 section part as follows:
“... which is due to removal of lotus stem epidermis containing lignin. Lotus stem
epidermis is damaged into debris, and then is completely removed during rinsing in
deionized water when time of treatment reaches 5 min. However, lignin in lotus fibers
is hardly damaged due to its complicated chemical structure. In addition, combination
between lignin and cellulose in lotus fibers is too strong to be broken by hydrogen
radical. Therefore, lignin content in lotus fibers almost remains constant with further
prolonging treatment time. ...”
2. Please compare moisture regains of lotus fibers and other nature fibers.
Answer: We have added related content in 3.8 section part as follows:
“... Moisture regain of lotus fibers is 7.62 %, which is close to those of cotton (7.48 %)
but slightly lower than those of flax (8.51 %) [28]. ...”
“[28] Zhang TH, Guo M, Cheng L, Li XL. 2015 Investigations on the structure and
properties of palm leaf sheath fiber. Cellulose 22, 1039-1051. (doi:10.1007/s10570-
015-0570-x)”
3. Please explain why tensile strength increases with prolonging treatment time.
Answer: We checked the manuscript and found it is mistyped word. The “increases”
should be changed to “decreases”. We have revised the error in the manuscript as
follows.
“...Therefore, tensile strength of lotus fibers decreases with prolonging the treatment
time. ..”
In addition, the related explanation has been added in section 3.10 of the
manuscript as follows.
“... The damage of external shell of in lotus fibers has detrimental effect on tensile
strength of lotus fibers. Cellulose macromolecular chains in lotus fibers are mainly
linked with hydrogen bonds which are easily slipped during dragging lotus fibers. The
number of hydrogen bonds between cellulose chain decreases with prolonging time of
treatment time....”
4. The English language requires improvement.
Answer: The manuscript has been proofread by Native speaker.
For example,
(1)All the full name of “<U+2103>” is “degree Celsius” instead of degree
Answer: The word of “degree” in the manuscript has been revised into “°C”.
“...Finally, the samples were dried at 50 °C and named as raw lotus fibers. ...”
“...Finally, the lotus fibers were rinsed to neutral and dried at 50 °C. ...”
“...TG was carried out under nitrogen flow at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 30 °C
to 750 °C (DTG-60, SHIMADZU, Japan). ...”
“...The samples were dried at 105 ± 2 °C for 1 h and then weighed. The samples were
then conditioned in the room with 65 % relative humidity at 20 °C. ...”
“...Initial weight loss stage of lotus fibers at a 100 °C to 110 °C is resulted from
volatilization of water and surface oil. The second stage for weight loss is observed
between 360 °C and 380 °C due to thermal depolymerisation of hemicellulose, pectin
and cleavage of glycosidic linkages of cellulose. The third stage for weight loss
occurs at 380 °C to 650 °C may be resulted from the breaking down of main chain
groups of lotus cellulose and slow decomposition of high molecular weight complex
of lignin [25]. Lotus fibers after being treated with hydrogen peroxide are almost
decomposed when the temperature is elevated to 700 °C, ...”
(2)In 2.3 section. Change of weight between the weights should be change to change
of weight.
Answer: We have corrected the mistake in section 2.3 as follows:
“...The samples were weighed per 5 minutes until change of weight is less than
0.1 %. ...”
(3)There is no space between two words such as “ fibertreated ” and
“thedecompostion”
Answer: This mistake has been revised in the manuscript as follows:
<1> The “fiberstreated” in section 2.3 should be “fibers treated ”.
“...Contents of waxes and water-soluble substances of lotus fibers treated with
hydrogen peroxide for 25 min are to 0.03 % and 3.48 %, respectively. ...”
<2> The “toequation” in section 2.3 should be “to equation”.
“...Crystallinity index (CI) was calculated according to Equation (2) ...”
<3> The “thedecompostion” in section 3.7 should be “the decomposition”.
“...Concentration of hydroxyl radicals increases with the decomposition of hydrogen
peroxide and then reach maximum. ...”
(4)“80m” should be replaced by “80µm” in section 3.3.
Answer: We have corrected the mistake in section 3.3 as follows:
“...Diameter of raw lotus fibers ranges from 75 µm to 80 µm. ...”
Reviewer #2:
The article is well-written and could be accepted for publication.
