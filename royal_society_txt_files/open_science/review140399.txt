The paper "Happy hamsters? Enrichment induces positive shifts in cognitive bias for ambiguous
cues to reward and punishment (but not true ambiguity) in Mesocricetus auratus" by Emily
Bethell and Nicola Koyama provides a detailed description on measuring emotional valence in
hamsters. The paper deals with a timely concept and adds not only another species to the list of
animals tested for cognitive bias but also makes a significant contribution to the methodological
procedures and statistical concepts of this field. The paper is well written and scientifically sound
and thus will make a very valuable contribution to "Royal Society Open Science". I have only
minor comments that might be considered in the final version of the paper.
The task includes a huge number of trials for pre-training and in the final test design another 60
trials were completed by each subjects. One thing that I am particularly interested in is the
amount of pre-training required. This information is given rather vaguely as in "all hamsters
reached this within 10 daily training sessions" (p7, l12) which equals up to 100 training trials let
alone for phase B. A table summarizing the total amount of training might be valuable and in
addition it might be interesting to calculate whether or not performance in pre-training affected
the final results (i.e., did better learners perform more or less optimistically?).
Overall, the huge workload by the researchers (or student workers and lab personal) required for
the intense training should be discussed with regard to the feasibility of conducting cognitive bias
studies for evaluating emotional valence in animals. Is there a way of automating such tests?
What is more, especially with regard to enrichment, the training in itself might be perceived as
entertaining by the hamsters rendering the "enrichment removed"-group as not too unenriched.
In the abstract it is not yet clear to the reader what exactly an "outer ambiguous probe" and a
"middle probe" might refer to as this will only be explained later in the method section. I suggest
rephrasing this part of the abstract to be more generally comprehensible.
On page 9, line 29: It is not clear to me how the amount of consumed water reflects the
"motivation to approach the drinkers". An intuitive measure for this motivation would be the
latency to approach the drinkers while the amount consumed reflects the motivation for sugar
consumption but is biased due to the fact that once the animal tested the drinker it knows that it
is rewarded.
In figure 2 the data should be separated (e.g., open circles moved horizontally to the left, closed
circles to the right) to see both groups especially for the ambiguous probe. The figure legend
should include information for the abbreviations used on the x-axis.
In figure 3 the letters "E" and "R" might be replaced by "Enrichment added" and "Enrichment
removed". If you decide to use color figures the black bars should be also colored blue for
consistency with figure 2.

Overview
The welfare of laboratory hamsters is an issue of concern, and an attempt to establish a proxy
measure of emotion and mood in these animals is of great benefit. However, I am concerned that
the task design, in particular the attempt to control for odour cues and the low learning criterion
used (see methods section) mean that the results cannot necessarily be interpreted within the
context of cognitive bias. Can the authors justify these two major methodological issues?
Furthermore, some incorrect assumptions about the general design of cognitive bias tasks and the
interpretation of responses to ambiguity were highlighted in the introduction and discussion.
Finally, the aim of the study is not clear (see comments below). It is important to explicitly and
clearly state the aim in order to properly evaluate this manuscript.
Introduction
- The authors rightly point out that the housing of laboratory hamsters may be an
important factor to consider with respect to their welfare, and highlight the potential deficiency
in the current housing guidelines for providing good hamster welfare. However they choose to
focus on short-term changes in enrichment. For welfare, I would expect that long-term changes in
enrichment are most beneficial provided the enrichment chosen provides suitable stimulation.
Short-term changes may induce changes in emotional state, but this gives no information about
the long-term benefits for hamster welfare. Why were short-term changes in enrichment chosen?
- What was the choice of enrichment for the enriched housing treatment was based on?
- The authors follow a somewhat logical structure to the introduction, firstly giving some
background information about the cognitive bias task. Here I would also expect some
background information about the use and welfare requirements of laboratory hamsters as they
are the subject of this study. This information is somewhat provided at the end of the
introduction but I feel it needs a larger prominence. Before providing the overview of the
experimental methods, the authors should also explicitly state the aims of the study. It is
somewhat confusing as to whether the authors’ primary aim is to establish a cognitive bias test
for use with hamsters, using changes in enrichment as a validation of the task, or whether the aim
is to investigate the effects of changes in enrichment on emotional state in hamsters, using
judgement bias as a proxy measure of emotional state. The primary aim should govern the
structure of the introduction.
- Specific points (Line numbers do not correspond exactly with the lines of text so it is
difficult to be precise. Hopefully it will be clear what sections I’m referring to.)
Page2, Lines 28-37: Not all references presented here use variants of a Go/No-Go design
as appears to be suggested by the author (e.g. refs 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 48 & 53 all use a
Go-Go design).
Page 2, Lines 56 – 58: This sentence fits better with the first paragraph as it is about the
advantages of a cognitive bias approach over more traditional methods
Page 3, Lines 3 - 14: These lines fit better in a contrast between the Go/No-Go and Go-
Go approaches to cognitive bias tasks.
Page 3, Lines 14 – 16: This final sentence should be removed as it is not the aim of this
study to attempt to make this distinction.
4
Page 3, Lines 19 – 44: This paragraph provides a nice summary of how the addition or
removal of enrichment has influenced judgement bias in a variety of studies. It does lack some
interpretation of the results, particularly when results were not as predicted. What is the
conclusion about enrichment and judgement bias?
Page 3, Lines 47 – 58: The active choice or Go-Go task is not so much more ‘recent’ as the
first active choice paper was published in 2008 (ref 24). It is not a variant of a Go/No-Go task but
a different approach to task design. Most importantly, the active choice task does not rely more
strongly on negative reinforcement than the Go/No-Go task; in some Go/No-Go tasks, a
negative outcome is used to encourage a No-Go response, while some active choice Go-Go
designs reward both responses (but vary the quantity of reward or the interval before reward
delivery, see refs 24, 48 & 53) to encourage correct responses to both positive and negative cues.
Thus, dismissing an active choice task on ethical grounds is incorrect. Finally, this paragraph is
out of place. A better order would be a presentation of both approaches followed by an accurate
evaluation of their merits, leading to the choice of task design used in this study.
Page 4, Line 4: The reference to `statistical approaches´ should be removed as this point
is not developed further.
Page 4, Lines 7 -25: You provide the criticisms of a Go/No-Go task design, yet you still
propose such a design for your study. This refers back to my previous point about providing a
better critique of both approaches and justifying the choice for one over the other, and identifying
methods to rule out the potential confounds highlighted by the critique.
Page 4, Line 44: Aims of the study should be presented explicitly before the methods
Page 4, Line 56 – End of page: The reference to the method of data analysis is not
necessary in the introduction, but should be presented in the methods section.
Page 5, end of Line 5: More details about what other measures were used and predictions
about the direction of results with respect to enrichment would be necessary here.
Methods
- The crossover design used in this experiment provides a good control for the effect of
treatment on performance. Cognitive bias tasks are notoriously susceptible to the effects of
repeated testing, and this design provides a good control for this.
- However, I am less convinced that the control for odour cues is performed in the correct
manner. By dividing sessions into blocks like this, it may be that you facilitate some learning
about the order of rewarded and non-rewarded trials. Thus, when a hamster is presented with an
ambiguous location, there may be some prior expectations about the likelihood of reward due to
the position of the ambiguous trial within the session. Furthermore, the reason for introducing a
variable reinforcement schedule is so that the animal can learn that correct responses are not
always rewarded, but the animal should not be able to predict which trials are unrewarded. Your
method appears to facilitate learning about the ambiguous cues as opposed to the intention to
mask that ambiguous cues are different from positive and negative reference location trials.
- The Trial order in each phase: Following on from the previous point, if the first and last
trials in each testing session were always S+ trials (Page 7, Lines 5 – 7), am I correct in thinking
that this means the second and second-to-last trials were always Q- trials? Thus not only are the
outcomes of the first and last two trials predictable without requiring learning based on the
location of the cue, the outcome of each of the five trials of blocks 2 and 4 is also predictable.
Therefore the only trials really assessing learning are those in Block 3 provided they are
randomly presented.
- While justification is given to the choice of test and, to some degree, the test design, I am
concerned about the criterion used to establish learning with respect to the reference positive and
negative cue locations, and the criterion of performance for inclusion in the analyses, are not at all
strict, and indeed barely above chance level. Why were these criteria used? And were they
established before performance of the task or decided afterwards? It can be difficult to set a
robust criterion when performing a treatment at a group level as individual performances may
vary. However, in order to be sure that responses to ambiguous probe location are true
judgements with respect to the reference cues, and not what would be expected by chance, one
must be sure that the animal really has learned the task and performs consistently with respect to
the reference cue locations.
5
- Structure and clarity of methods section: The descriptions of each training and testing
phase, as well as the timing of the treatments is hard to follow.
- Missing: Criterion for a “Go” response. What was the exact criterion used to categorise a
response as a Go response if animals were removed upon reaching an empty drinker in control
trials?
- The other behavioural measures and tasks used ought to have been introduced briefly in
the Introduction
- The statistical approach used needs a little introduction as it is less well known than
other more common approaches.
- Specific Points
Page 6, Lines 28 – 30: This is a result and should be presented in the results section
Page 6, Lines 26 – 27: What was the maximum length of habituation sessions per group?
Page 6, Line 55: ´according to Individual rates of learning’ is not clear. What specifically
determined the reduction in trial time required for each hamster?
Page 7, Line 5: ‘to aid learning’. How does this procedure aid learning?
Page 7, Lines 9 – 14: Is this criterion strict enough to demonstrate learning. The binomial
probability reaching a performance of 3/5 correct responses over 3 days is 0.125, and this
criterion allows for 40% error responses in any one session.
Page 7, Lines 24 – 35: This explanation is confusing.
Page 7, Lines 32 – 35: Why was the hamster removed upon reaching the drinker?
Page 7, Lines 35 – 39: Again, is this criterion sufficient? It allows for a 50% error response
to the ambiguous cues, i.e. chance level. Why was this chosen?
Page 8, Lines 27 – 30: This sentence is a point for the introduction, not methods.
Page 8, Lines 49 – 53: The meaning of this sentence is not clear.
Page 9, Lines 30 – 31: I do not find further mention how the data with respect to the
amount drunk was analysed.
Page 9, Line 44: Why is this termed `Activity Score` if the behaviours are said to indicate
stress or anxiety? The term `activity` is too easily confused with `locomotion` and we would
suggest an alternative name reflecting the negative connotations of the behaviours should be
used.
Page 10, Lines 25 – 29: Again, this criterion is barely above chance level. Why was this
criterion chosen? Without a strict criterion for learning and inclusion of subjects, it leads to the
conclusion that responses to the ambiguous locations could also be mostly by chance.
Page 10, Line 35: The use of ‘testing block’ here should be explained as it can easily be
confused with the term ‘block’ as used in Table 1 to describe the trial order.
Page 10, Lines 35 – 37: Please list each factor for each explanatory variable e.g. Treatment
(E, R) so that the reader knows how many levels are in each variable
Page 10, Line 57: Reference for this statement is needed.
Page 10, Lines 46 – Page 11, Line 9: These are results and should be presented in the
results section.
Discussion
- Recap of the aims of the study should be presented first before summarising the main
results. Again, it is not clear whether the aim was to establish a task, or measure effects of
provision and removal of enrichment in hamsters.
- Discussion should take into account the methodological issues highlighted above re the
learning criterion and the trial order.
Page 14, Line 27 – 29: Does the task used by the authors meet all five of the theoretical
expectations of such tasks as proposed by Gygax (2014)? This is a good model for evaluating the
task used.
Page 14, Line 34: The authors refer to the ´standard judgement bias task’ but I would
argue that there is clearly no ‘standard’ task, some broad similarities between task types exist, but
there is no agreed upon standard task. For example, the task design presented in this study also
differs from previous task designs.
Page 14, Lines 34 – 41: How the authors have investigated these potential confounds
needs to be expanded upon, taking into account my suggestions on the suitability of their control
6
trials and semi-fixed trial order discussed previously. Also helpful here would be a discussion of
the fact that 1/5th of the animals did not reach criterion level of performance despite the fact that,
as mentioned previously, the criterion was possibly set too low.
Page 15, Lines 17 – 23: This is an incorrect assumption. Please see notes on the use of
negative reinforcement in judgement bias task designs in introduction section.
Page 16, Lines 20 – 22: The authors should re-evaluate how successful their use of
variable reinforcement was in light of my comments in the methods section. Indeed the effect of
block shows some learning about the probe trials.
Page 16, Line 30: repetition of `to reward´?
Page 18, Lines 22 – 33: The cognitive bias task can only be used as a relative measure of
animal mood i.e. can only tell us how one group/treatment compares to a control. The authors’
suggestion that animals can be seen as “categorically” optimistic or pessimistic if they respond to
ambiguous cues more or less than expected by chance is therefore incorrect. Many factors in the
task design may influence the chance of an animal responding positively to an ambiguous cue,
such as the relative outcomes of a Go or No-Go response.

Overview
The welfare of laboratory hamsters is an issue of concern, and an attempt to establish a proxy
measure of emotion and mood in these animals is of great benefit. However, I am concerned that
the task design, in particular the attempt to control for odour cues and the low learning criterion
used (see methods section) mean that the results cannot necessarily be interpreted within the
context of cognitive bias. Can the authors justify these two major methodological issues?
Furthermore, some incorrect assumptions about the general design of cognitive bias tasks and the
interpretation of responses to ambiguity were highlighted in the introduction and discussion.
Finally, the aim of the study is not clear (see comments below). It is important to explicitly and
clearly state the aim in order to properly evaluate this manuscript.
Introduction
- The authors rightly point out that the housing of laboratory hamsters may be an
important factor to consider with respect to their welfare, and highlight the potential deficiency
in the current housing guidelines for providing good hamster welfare. However they choose to
focus on short-term changes in enrichment. For welfare, I would expect that long-term changes in
enrichment are most beneficial provided the enrichment chosen provides suitable stimulation.
Short-term changes may induce changes in emotional state, but this gives no information about
the long-term benefits for hamster welfare. Why were short-term changes in enrichment chosen?
- What was the choice of enrichment for the enriched housing treatment was based on?
- The authors follow a somewhat logical structure to the introduction, firstly giving some
background information about the cognitive bias task. Here I would also expect some
background information about the use and welfare requirements of laboratory hamsters as they
are the subject of this study. This information is somewhat provided at the end of the
introduction but I feel it needs a larger prominence. Before providing the overview of the
experimental methods, the authors should also explicitly state the aims of the study. It is
somewhat confusing as to whether the authors’ primary aim is to establish a cognitive bias test
for use with hamsters, using changes in enrichment as a validation of the task, or whether the aim
is to investigate the effects of changes in enrichment on emotional state in hamsters, using
judgement bias as a proxy measure of emotional state. The primary aim should govern the
structure of the introduction.
- Specific points (Line numbers do not correspond exactly with the lines of text so it is
difficult to be precise. Hopefully it will be clear what sections I’m referring to.)
Page2, Lines 28-37: Not all references presented here use variants of a Go/No-Go design
as appears to be suggested by the author (e.g. refs 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 48 & 53 all use a
Go-Go design).
Page 2, Lines 56 – 58: This sentence fits better with the first paragraph as it is about the
advantages of a cognitive bias approach over more traditional methods
Page 3, Lines 3 - 14: These lines fit better in a contrast between the Go/No-Go and Go-
Go approaches to cognitive bias tasks.
Page 3, Lines 14 – 16: This final sentence should be removed as it is not the aim of this
study to attempt to make this distinction.
Page 3, Lines 19 – 44: This paragraph provides a nice summary of how the addition or
removal of enrichment has influenced judgement bias in a variety of studies. It does lack some
interpretation of the results, particularly when results were not as predicted. What is the
conclusion about enrichment and judgement bias?
Page 3, Lines 47 – 58: The active choice or Go-Go task is not so much more ‘recent’ as the
first active choice paper was published in 2008 (ref 24). It is not a variant of a Go/No-Go task but
a different approach to task design. Most importantly, the active choice task does not rely more
10
strongly on negative reinforcement than the Go/No-Go task; in some Go/No-Go tasks, a
negative outcome is used to encourage a No-Go response, while some active choice Go-Go
designs reward both responses (but vary the quantity of reward or the interval before reward
delivery, see refs 24, 48 & 53) to encourage correct responses to both positive and negative cues.
Thus, dismissing an active choice task on ethical grounds is incorrect. Finally, this paragraph is
out of place. A better order would be a presentation of both approaches followed by an accurate
evaluation of their merits, leading to the choice of task design used in this study.
Page 4, Line 4: The reference to `statistical approaches´ should be removed as this point
is not developed further.
Page 4, Lines 7 -25: You provide the criticisms of a Go/No-Go task design, yet you still
propose such a design for your study. This refers back to my previous point about providing a
better critique of both approaches and justifying the choice for one over the other, and identifying
methods to rule out the potential confounds highlighted by the critique.
Page 4, Line 44: Aims of the study should be presented explicitly before the methods
Page 4, Line 56 – End of page: The reference to the method of data analysis is not
necessary in the introduction, but should be presented in the methods section.
Page 5, end of Line 5: More details about what other measures were used and predictions
about the direction of results with respect to enrichment would be necessary here.
Methods
- The crossover design used in this experiment provides a good control for the effect of
treatment on performance. Cognitive bias tasks are notoriously susceptible to the effects of
repeated testing, and this design provides a good control for this.
- However, I am less convinced that the control for odour cues is performed in the correct
manner. By dividing sessions into blocks like this, it may be that you facilitate some learning
about the order of rewarded and non-rewarded trials. Thus, when a hamster is presented with an
ambiguous location, there may be some prior expectations about the likelihood of reward due to
the position of the ambiguous trial within the session. Furthermore, the reason for introducing a
variable reinforcement schedule is so that the animal can learn that correct responses are not
always rewarded, but the animal should not be able to predict which trials are unrewarded. Your
method appears to facilitate learning about the ambiguous cues as opposed to the intention to
mask that ambiguous cues are different from positive and negative reference location trials.
- The Trial order in each phase: Following on from the previous point, if the first and last
trials in each testing session were always S+ trials (Page 7, Lines 5 – 7), am I correct in thinking
that this means the second and second-to-last trials were always Q- trials? Thus not only are the
outcomes of the first and last two trials predictable without requiring learning based on the
location of the cue, the outcome of each of the five trials of blocks 2 and 4 is also predictable.
Therefore the only trials really assessing learning are those in Block 3 provided they are
randomly presented.
- While justification is given to the choice of test and, to some degree, the test design, I am
concerned about the criterion used to establish learning with respect to the reference positive and
negative cue locations, and the criterion of performance for inclusion in the analyses, are not at all
strict, and indeed barely above chance level. Why were these criteria used? And were they
established before performance of the task or decided afterwards? It can be difficult to set a
robust criterion when performing a treatment at a group level as individual performances may
vary. However, in order to be sure that responses to ambiguous probe location are true
judgements with respect to the reference cues, and not what would be expected by chance, one
must be sure that the animal really has learned the task and performs consistently with respect to
the reference cue locations.
- Structure and clarity of methods section: The descriptions of each training and testing
phase, as well as the timing of the treatments is hard to follow.
- Missing: Criterion for a “Go” response. What was the exact criterion used to categorise a
response as a Go response if animals were removed upon reaching an empty drinker in control
trials?
- The other behavioural measures and tasks used ought to have been introduced briefly in
the Introduction
11
- The statistical approach used needs a little introduction as it is less well known than
other more common approaches.
- Specific Points
Page 6, Lines 28 – 30: This is a result and should be presented in the results section
Page 6, Lines 26 – 27: What was the maximum length of habituation sessions per group?
Page 6, Line 55: ´according to Individual rates of learning’ is not clear. What specifically
determined the reduction in trial time required for each hamster?
Page 7, Line 5: ‘to aid learning’. How does this procedure aid learning?
Page 7, Lines 9 – 14: Is this criterion strict enough to demonstrate learning. The binomial
probability reaching a performance of 3/5 correct responses over 3 days is 0.125, and this
criterion allows for 40% error responses in any one session.
Page 7, Lines 24 – 35: This explanation is confusing.
Page 7, Lines 32 – 35: Why was the hamster removed upon reaching the drinker?
Page 7, Lines 35 – 39: Again, is this criterion sufficient? It allows for a 50% error response
to the ambiguous cues, i.e. chance level. Why was this chosen?
Page 8, Lines 27 – 30: This sentence is a point for the introduction, not methods.
Page 8, Lines 49 – 53: The meaning of this sentence is not clear.
Page 9, Lines 30 – 31: I do not find further mention how the data with respect to the
amount drunk was analysed.
Page 9, Line 44: Why is this termed `Activity Score` if the behaviours are said to indicate
stress or anxiety? The term `activity` is too easily confused with `locomotion` and we would
suggest an alternative name reflecting the negative connotations of the behaviours should be
used.
Page 10, Lines 25 – 29: Again, this criterion is barely above chance level. Why was this
criterion chosen? Without a strict criterion for learning and inclusion of subjects, it leads to the
conclusion that responses to the ambiguous locations could also be mostly by chance.
Page 10, Line 35: The use of ‘testing block’ here should be explained as it can easily be
confused with the term ‘block’ as used in Table 1 to describe the trial order.
Page 10, Lines 35 – 37: Please list each factor for each explanatory variable e.g. Treatment
(E, R) so that the reader knows how many levels are in each variable
Page 10, Line 57: Reference for this statement is needed.
Page 10, Lines 46 – Page 11, Line 9: These are results and should be presented in the
results section.
Discussion
- Recap of the aims of the study should be presented first before summarising the main
results. Again, it is not clear whether the aim was to establish a task, or measure effects of
provision and removal of enrichment in hamsters.
- Discussion should take into account the methodological issues highlighted above re the
learning criterion and the trial order.
Page 14, Line 27 – 29: Does the task used by the authors meet all five of the theoretical
expectations of such tasks as proposed by Gygax (2014)? This is a good model for evaluating the
task used.
Page 14, Line 34: The authors refer to the ´standard judgement bias task’ but I would
argue that there is clearly no ‘standard’ task, some broad similarities between task types exist, but
there is no agreed upon standard task. For example, the task design presented in this study also
differs from previous task designs.
Page 14, Lines 34 – 41: How the authors have investigated these potential confounds
needs to be expanded upon, taking into account my suggestions on the suitability of their control
trials and semi-fixed trial order discussed previously. Also helpful here would be a discussion of
the fact that 1/5th of the animals did not reach criterion level of performance despite the fact that,
as mentioned previously, the criterion was possibly set too low.
Page 15, Lines 17 – 23: This is an incorrect assumption. Please see notes on the use of
negative reinforcement in judgement bias task designs in introduction section.
12
Page 16, Lines 20 – 22: The authors should re-evaluate how successful their use of
variable reinforcement was in light of my comments in the methods section. Indeed the effect of
block shows some learning about the probe trials.
Page 16, Line 30: repetition of `to reward´?
Page 18, Lines 22 – 33: The cognitive bias task can only be used as a relative measure of
animal mood i.e. can only tell us how one group/treatment compares to a control. The authors’
suggestion that animals can be seen as “categorically” optimistic or pessimistic if they respond to
ambiguous cues more or less than expected by chance is therefore incorrect. Many factors in the
task design may influence the chance of an animal responding positively to an ambiguous cue,
such as the relative outcomes of a Go or No-Go response.
Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-140399)
Dear Editors,
Thank you for inviting us to resubmit our manuscript. We have addressed all of the points raised
by the reviewers and feel the manuscript is greatly improved. Responses are included as two
separate files - one per reviewer and line numbers refer to the line numbers in the main
document. In particular we would like to point out that performance on the discrimination task
was much better than it appeared from our first draft (in which we did not present these data).
We have now included additional supplementary material to clarify this. All animals included in
the analyses performed above chance (some at >90% accuracy). The level of performance we
trained animals to was above that typically used in these types of studies. The majority of
concerns raised by reviewer 2 are dealt with following to this clarification.
We have included an additional figure (new figure 1) to clarify the timing of treatments and four
sets of new supplementary material presenting the performance data (ESM 2-5). We have added
line numbers to the revised manuscript and referred to these in the comments to the reviewers.
We thank you for receiving this revised manuscript and look forward to hearing your decision.
Best wishes,
Emily Bethell and Nicola Koyama

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper "Happy hamsters? Enrichment induces positive shifts in cognitive bias for ambiguous cues
to reward and punishment (but not true ambiguity) in Mesocricetus auratus" by Emily Bethell and
Nicola Koyama provides a detailed description on measuring emotional valence in hamsters. The
paper deals with a timely concept and adds not only another species to the list of animals tested for
cognitive bias but also makes a significant contribution to the methodological procedures and
statistical concepts of this field. The paper is well written and scientifically sound and thus will make
a very valuable contribution to "Royal Society Open Science". I have only minor comments that
might be considered in the final version of the paper.
We thank Reviewer 1 for these encouraging comments and address specific points below.
The task includes a huge number of trials for pre-training and in the final test design another 60 trials
were completed by each subjects. One thing that I am particularly interested in is the amount of pre-
training required. This information is given rather vaguely as in "all hamsters reached this within 10
daily training sessions" (p7, l12) which equals up to 100 training trials let alone for phase B. A table
summarizing the total amount of training might be valuable…
We have now included training data in the Supplementary material S2 – S4.
…and in addition it might be interesting to calculate whether or not performance in pre-training
affected the final results (i.e. did better learners perform more or less optimistically?).
We thank the reviewer for making this very good point. We went back to the data and included
speed of learning in the list of variables for inclusion in the models (line 354). Analysis of covariation
between variables revealed that rate of learning correlated with sibling group, (and is therefore
already partially controlled for in the nested random factors Group/ID included in the models). We
also inspected the possible effect of speed to learn on Go-NoGo responses during testing by
comparing the influence of speed to learn against the null model, which revealed rate of learning
does not explain the data any better than the null model. We present the additional analyses here:

Overall, the huge workload by the researchers (or student workers and lab personal) required for
the intense training should be discussed with regard to the feasibility of conducting cognitive bias
studies for evaluating emotional valence in animals. Is there a way of automating such tests? What is
more, especially with regard to enrichment, the training in itself might be perceived as entertaining
by the hamsters rendering the "enrichment removed"-group as not too unenriched.
We have now clarified our aim to validate a test to measure Judgment bias rather than to apply the
test to measure the effect of the enrichment treatments. We have also made it more explicit in the
discussion that automated tests are a future direction for judgement bias tasks (line 669)
In the abstract it is not yet clear to the reader what exactly an "outer ambiguous probe" and a
"middle probe" might refer to as this will only be explained later in the method section. I suggest
rephrasing this part of the abstract to be more generally comprehensible.
We have amended this (lines 29 and 30)
On page 9, line 29: It is not clear to me how the amount of consumed water reflects the "motivation
to approach the drinkers". An intuitive measure for this motivation would be the latency to
approach the drinkers while the amount consumed reflects the motivation for sugar consumption
but is biased due to the fact that once the animal tested the drinker it knows that it is rewarded.
We have now removed this paragraph.
In figure 2 the data should be separated (e.g., open circles moved horizontally to the left, closed
circles to the right) to see both groups especially for the ambiguous probe. The figure legend should
include information for the abbreviations used on the x-axis.
(now figure 3) We have distinguished the central probe so that it is now clear that the two data
points overlap and added information for the x axis abbreviations.
In figure 3 the letters "E" and "R" might be replaced by "Enrichment added" and "Enrichment
removed". If you decide to use color figures the black bars should be also colored blue for
consistency with figure 2.
(now figure 4) We have adjusted the colour and explained this in the figure legend.
Response to Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
Overview
he welfare of laboratory hamsters is an issue of concern, and an attempt to establish a proxy measure of
motion and mood in these animals is of great benefit. However, I am concerned that the task design, in
particular the attempt to control for odour cues and the low learning criterion used (see methods section)
mean that the results cannot necessarily be interpreted within the context of cognitive bias. Can the authors
ustify these two major methodological issues?
urthermore, some incorrect assumptions about the general design of cognitive bias tasks and the
nterpretation of responses to ambiguity were highlighted in the introduction and discussion.
inally, the aim of the study is not clear (see comments below). It is important to explicitly and clearly state the
im in order to properly evaluate this manuscript.
We thank the Reviewer for this extremely useful feedback and have addressed these points in the response
below.
ntroduction
. The authors rightly point out that the housing of laboratory hamsters may be an important factor to
onsider with respect to their welfare, and highlight the potential deficiency in the current housing guidelines
or providing good hamster welfare. However they choose to focus on short-term changes in enrichment. For
welfare, I would expect that long-term changes in enrichment are most beneficial provided the enrichment
hosen provides suitable stimulation. Short-term changes may induce changes in emotional state, but this
ives no information about the long-term benefits for hamster welfare. Why were short-term changes in
nrichment chosen?
We have removed consideration of hamsters’ long-term enrichment/welfare as this was not the focus of our
tudy. and made it clear that our main aim is to validate a cognitive bias task for hamsters. Focusing on short-
erm changes in enrichment allowed us to use a more rigorous cross-over study design. We now justify this
more fully at lines 122 - 143.
. What was the choice of enrichment for the enriched housing treatment was based on?
Choice of enrichment was based on previous studies of cage enrichment in hamsters. We gave references
Veillette & Reebs, 2011; Lanteigne & Reebs, 2006) in the Methods (under Housing treatments), which we
have now expanded (lines 281 – 288), and have now also included these in the Introduction (line 151) to justify
our choice.
. The authors follow a somewhat logical structure to the introduction, firstly giving some background
nformation about the cognitive bias task. Here I would also expect some background information about the
use and welfare requirements of laboratory hamsters as they are the subject of this study. This information is
omewhat provided at the end of the introduction but I feel it needs a larger prominence.
We have now made our aim more explicit - we are developing and validating a method, rather than tracking
welfare in the hamsters. We now mention laboratory rodent welfare, and the lack of studies on hamsters, in
he first paragraph (lines 48-51), and mention broader implications of this approach for hamster welfare in the
discussion at lines 506, 667-670.
Before providing the overview of the experimental methods, the authors should also explicitly state the aims
of the study. It is somewhat confusing as to whether the authors’ primary aim is to establish a cognitive bias
est for use with hamsters, using changes in enrichment as a validation of the task, or whether the aim is to
nvestigate the effects of changes in enrichment on emotional state in hamsters, using judgement bias as a
proxy measure of emotional state. The primary aim should govern the structure of the introduction.
We have made our aim (validation of a cognitive bias task in hamsters) more explicit (lines 145-146)
Specific points (Line numbers do not correspond exactly with the lines of text so it is difficult to be
precise. Hopefully it will be clear what sections I’m referring to.)
. Page2, Lines 28-37: Not all references presented here use variants of a Go/No-Go design as appears to be
uggested by the author (e.g. refs 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 48 & 53 all use a Go-Go design).
We have updated the references according to whether a go-nogo task (lines 53-68) or active choice task (lines
8-91)
. Page 2, Lines 56 – 58: This sentence fits better with the first paragraph as it is about the advantages of a
ognitive bias approach over more traditional methods
We have moved this sentence to the first paragraph.
. Page 3, Lines 3 - 14: These lines fit better in a contrast between the Go/No-Go and Go-Go approaches to
ognitive bias tasks.
We have moved this where we consider the active choice approach.
. Page 3, Lines 14 – 16: This final sentence should be removed as it is not the aim of this study to attempt to
make this distinction.
entence removed
. Page 3, Lines 19 – 44: This paragraph provides a nice summary of how the addition or removal of enrichment
has influenced judgement bias in a variety of studies. It does lack some interpretation of the results,
particularly when results were not as predicted. What is the conclusion about enrichment and judgement bias?
We have added some more details and interpretation of the literature (lines 117 – 143) – primarility the
mportance of crossover designs to control for additional factors (141-143).
. Page 3, Lines 47 – 58: The active choice or Go-Go task is not so much more ‘recent’ as the first active choice
paper was published in 2008 (ref 24). It is not a variant of a Go/No-Go task but a different approach to task
design. Most importantly, the active choice task does not rely more strongly on negative reinforcement than
he Go/No-Go task; in some Go/No-Go tasks, a negative outcome is used to encourage a No-Go response,
while some active choice Go-Go designs reward both responses (but vary the quantity of reward or the interval
before reward delivery, see refs 24, 48 & 53) to encourage correct responses to both positive and negative
ues. Thus, dismissing an active choice task on ethical grounds is incorrect. Finally, this paragraph is out of
place. A better order would be a presentation of both approaches followed by an accurate evaluation of their
merits, leading to the choice of task design used in this study.
We have amended this paragraph to make it clear that active choice is a different test, not a variant (line 78),
nd that active choice tests do not necessarily require negative reinforcement (lines 82 – 91), although some
do use it. We have also moved the paragraph as suggested, followed by an evaluation of the two approaches.
0. Page 4, Line 4: The reference to `statistical approaches´ should be removed as this point is not developed
urther.
We keep this point as we develop it further, and do so more clearly now at lines 96, 162 – 170.
1. Page 4, Lines 7 -25: You provide the criticisms of a Go/No-Go task design, yet you still propose such a
design for your study. This refers back to my previous point about providing a better critique of both
pproaches and justifying the choice for one over the other, and identifying methods to rule out the potential
onfounds highlighted by the critique.
We have edited the last paragraph about our approach and make it clear how we counter the (now numbered)
methodological criticisms in our study.
2. Page 4, Line 44: Aims of the study should be presented explicitly before the methods
We have presented aims explicitly in the last paragraph of the introduction (line 145 – 173)
3. Page 4, Line 56 – End of page: The reference to the method of data analysis is not necessary in the
ntroduction, but should be presented in the methods section.
As this relates to our criticisms above and justifies the choice of approach in our study we have kept this in.
4. Page 5, end of Line 5: More details about what other measures were used and predictions about the
direction of results with respect to enrichment would be necessary here.
We have added details of behavioural measures and predictions (lines 154 – 159).
Methods
The crossover design used in this experiment provides a good control for the effect of treatment
on performance. Cognitive bias tasks are notoriously susceptible to the effects of repeated testing, and
his design provides a good control for this.
However, I am less convinced that the control for odour cues is performed in the correct manner.
By dividing sessions into blocks like this, it may be that you facilitate some learning about the order of
ewarded and non-rewarded trials. Thus, when a hamster is presented with an ambiguous location, there
may be some prior expectations about the likelihood of reward due to the position of the ambiguous trial
within the session. Furthermore, the reason for introducing a variable reinforcement schedule is so that
he animal can learn that correct responses are not always rewarded, but the animal should not be able
o predict which trials are unrewarded. Your method appears to facilitate learning about the ambiguous
ues as opposed to the intention to mask that ambiguous cues are different from positive and negative
eference location trials.
We take the reviewer’s point that hamsters could learn reward contingencies based on the position of
rials within the session and not location. Had the trials been presented in the same order on every day
hen hamsters might have learned to predict the order of rewarded and unrewarded trials. We tried to
implify presentation of order of trials for the reader. In reality, order of trials was less structured than
was shown. We have now adjusted Table 1 to reflect more clearly how the reinforcement trials were
pseudorandomised with the control trials. It is not likely that hamsters were able to predict which trials
were rewarded, and which not, because trial order was somewhat more random than the 5-block design
uggested. In fact, hamsters took part in two blocks, and we have adjusted Table 1 to reflect this. Based
on the reviewer’s feedback, we explored the possibility of trial position influencing responses. There was
no clear pattern. Take trial 3, for example, which should be the easiest trial to predict is never rewarded:
when C+ was presented at this location on the third trial hamsters were as quick to approach it (9 seconds)
s on any other trial (range: 9-17 seconds), suggesting hamsters had not learnt the rule ‘third trial is never
ewarded’.
We maintain that the variable reinforcement ratio reduces the rate of learning that probe trials are never
ewarded as it reduces likelihood of one-trial learning. Having a 100% fixed reinforcement ratio increases
he chances of one-trial learning on (non-rewarded) probe trials.
The Trial order in each phase: Following on from the previous point, if the first and last trials in
each testing session were always S+ trials (Page 7, Lines 5 – 7), am I correct in thinking that this means the
econd and second-to-last trials were always Q- trials? Thus not only are the outcomes of the first and last
wo trials predictable without requiring learning based on the location of the cue, the outcome of each of
he five trials of blocks 2 and 4 is also predictable. Therefore the only trials really assessing learning are
hose in Block 3 provided they are randomly presented.
Most hamsters reached criterion for learning the task during Phase B, when the first and last trials were
lways sugar, the second trial always QHCl, and all trials inbetween (sugar or QHCl) were randomised so
hat the penultimate trials could be either sugar or QHCl. Based on the reviewer’s feedback were checked
he data and there is no evidence of learning based on trial n.
While justification is given to the choice of test and, to some degree, the test design, I am
oncerned about the criterion used to establish learning with respect to the reference positive and
negative cue locations, and the criterion of performance for inclusion in the analyses, are not at all strict,
nd indeed barely above chance level. Why were these criteria used? And were they established before
performance of the task or decided afterwards? It can be difficult to set a robust criterion when
performing a treatment at a group level as individual performances may vary.
We monitored individual hamsters’ performance (speed to approach and Prop approaches) on a daily
basis to ensure that they were engaging in the task, and to monitor learning. As we were developing the
method we did not have a strict a priori learning criterion. We monitored learning using both latency and
proportion data during training and have now presented the training and performance data in the
electronic supplementary material (S2, S3 and S4). In line with previous Judgement bias studies we have
used a comparison of latencies across consecutive days of training, which is now specified in the paper
lines 237 – 239). Performance on discrimination trials (both the reinforced and control trials) during
Phase B, for example, was 64% - 84% accuracy.
However, in order to be sure that responses to ambiguous probe location are true judgements with
espect to the reference cues, and not what would be expected by chance, one must be sure that the
nimal really has learned the task and performs consistently with respect to the reference cue locations.
he reviewer is correct that the criteria we had presented were low. These values are misleading, and we
have removed them from the text as they were used to assess that hamsters were continuing to approach
he drinkers during training, rather than to assess learning per se. We have now made reference instead
o the overall discrimination criterion (which we had not reported) which was faster responses to the
ugar control compared to the QHCl control on each of three consecutive days.
Structure and clarity of methods section: The descriptions of each training and testing phase, as
well as the timing of the treatments is hard to follow.
We have created a new figure 1 which shows the timeline for the study. We have also removed the
habituation week from the Phases so that Phase and week number are now easier to follow (i.e. Phase A
= week 1).
Missing: Criterion for a “Go” response. What was the exact criterion used to categorise a
esponse as a Go response if animals were removed upon reaching an empty drinker in control trials?
We have added a sentence at line 231:
If the hamster approached the drinker to within 3 millimetres within the predetermined trial duration this
was scored as a ‘Go’.’
The other behavioural measures and tasks used ought to have been introduced briefly in the
ntroduction
Now added at lines 156-159
The statistical approach used needs a little introduction as it is less well known than other more
ommon approaches.
Now added to introduction at lines 162 - 170
Specific Points
<U+F0D7> Page 6, Lines 28 – 30: This is a result and should be presented in the results section
Based on the reviewer feedback we have moved this to the results section. We have also reordered some
of the results to reflect the changes made to presentation of the phases in the methods
<U+F0D7> Page 6, Lines 26 – 27: What was the maximum length of habituation sessions per group?
Added: 5 minutes (line 213)
<U+F0D7> Page 6, Line 55: ´according to Individual rates of learning’ is not clear. What specifically
determined the reduction in trial time required for each hamster?
Clarified (lines 227 – 231): ‘As hamsters learned the task and became faster to approach, sessions were
equentially adjusted to 8 x 60 second trials, and then 10 x 30 second trials. This adjustment was made
ccording to individual response latencies so that trial duration was reduced quickly for fast-responding
hamsters, and more slowly for hamsters who needed the extra time to approach.’
<U+F0D7> Page 7, Line 5: ‘to aid learning’. How does this procedure aid learning?
Amended text (line 235 – 237): ‘The first and last trials were always sugar trials so that each session began
nd ended with a positive association with the arena (same throughout all subsequent phases).
<U+F0D7> Page 7, Lines 9 – 14: Is this criterion strict enough to demonstrate learning. The binomial
probability reaching a performance of 3/5 correct responses over 3 days is 0.125, and this criterion allows
or 40% error responses in any one session.
ee comments above.
<U+F0D7> Page 7, Lines 24 – 35: This explanation is confusing.
We have now presented the 2 blocks in which hamsters took part in trials makes this easier to follow than
he 5 block design we used during planing (see also changes to Table 1). This is also clearer to follow later
n the experimental testing phases C and D.
<U+F0D7> Page 7, Lines 32 – 35: Why was the hamster removed upon reaching the drinker?
Clarified (lines 252 – 254): To ‘…reduce the possibility of animals becoming frustrated if left to attempt to

<U+F0D7> Page 7, Lines 35 – 39: Again, is this criterion sufficient? It allows for a 50% error response to the
mbiguous cues, i.e. chance level. Why was this chosen?
ee comments above.
<U+F0D7> Page 8, Lines 27 – 30: This sentence is a point for the introduction, not methods.
Moved to introduction.
<U+F0D7> Page 8, Lines 49 – 53: The meaning of this sentence is not clear.
Reworded
<U+F0D7> Page 9, Lines 30 – 31: I do not find further mention how the data with respect to the amount
drunk was analysed.
We have removed this paragraph.
<U+F0D7> Page 9, Line 44: Why is this termed `Activity Score` if the behaviours are said to indicate stress or
nxiety? The term `activity` is too easily confused with `locomotion` and we would suggest an alternative
name reflecting the negative connotations of the behaviours should be used.
Renamed ‘Anxiety score’
<U+F0D7> Page 10, Lines 25 – 29: Again, this criterion is barely above chance level. Why was this criterion
hosen? Without a strict criterion for learning and inclusion of subjects, it leads to the conclusion that
esponses to the ambiguous locations could also be mostly by chance.
We have added the following justification (lines 341 – 346) and also present the performance data for
Phase C and D in the supplementary material (this shows hamsters continued to be faster to approach the
C+ compared to the C- throughout testing).
We used a generous criterion for inclusion in the analyses since we wanted to explore the potential
nfluence of a range of factors on performance in the judgement bias task. We did not want to bias
indings by selectively removing hamsters who were perceived to be poor performers if changes in
performance reflected meaningful responses to the enrichment treatments. However, we wanted to
emove hamsters who stopped responding on the task altogether.’
<U+F0D7> Page 10, Line 35: The use of ‘testing block’ here should be explained as it can easily be
onfused with the term ‘block’ as used in Table 1 to describe the trial order.
his should now be clearer with the change to Table 1.
<U+F0D7> Page 10, Lines 35 – 37: Please list each factor for each explanatory variable e.g. Treatment (E, R)
o that the reader knows how many levels are in each variable
Added at lines 350 - 354
<U+F0D7> Page 10, Line 57: Reference for this statement is needed.
Added refs 80 and 81
<U+F0D7> Page 10, Lines 46 – Page 11, Line 9: These are results and should be presented in the results
ection.
Model development is part of the method, so we have added a heading to signify this.
Discussion
. Recap of the aims of the study should be presented first before summarising the main results. Again, it is not
lear whether the aim was to establish a task, or measure effects of provision and removal of enrichment in
hamsters.
We have recapped our main finding to reflect the aim.
. Discussion should take into account the methodological issues highlighted above re the learning criterion
nd the trial order.
hese are now dealt with in the revised Methods section.
. Page 14, Line 27 – 29: Does the task used by the authors meet all five of the theoretical expectations of such
asks as proposed by Gygax (2014)? This is a good model for evaluating the task used.
We have inserted reference to Gygax’ performance criteria (line 169 and 558 – 567) which were met in this
tudy.
. Page 14, Line 34: The authors refer to the ´standard judgement bias task’ but I would argue that there is
learly no ‘standard’ task, some broad similarities between task types exist, but there is no agreed upon
tandard task. For example, the task design presented in this study also differs from previous task designs.
standard’ has now been removed from this phrase throughout.
. Page 14, Lines 34 – 41: How the authors have investigated these potential confounds needs to be expanded
upon, taking into account my suggestions on the suitability of their control trials and semi-fixed trial order
discussed previously. Also helpful here would be a discussion of the fact that 1/5th of the animals did not reach
riterion level of performance despite the fact that, as mentioned previously, the criterion was possibly set too
ow.
hese issues are no longer relevant (see revised methods and additional Supplementary material).
. Page 15, Lines 17 – 23: This is an incorrect assumption. Please see notes on the use of negative
einforcement in judgement bias task designs in introduction section.
We have deleted this sentence.
. Page 16, Lines 20 – 22: The authors should re-evaluate how successful their use of variable reinforcement
was in light of my comments in the methods section. Indeed the effect of block shows some learning about the
probe trials.
We have clarified our definitions of the blocks to show that predictability was minimal. If this was an issue the
hamsters would cease responding to the C+ and C- probes, but they continued to approach them throughout
see supplementary material). We discuss the effect of block at lines 577 – 590). The effect was strongest for
he sugar location so motivation is also a potential explanation for this effect.
. Page 16, Line 30: repetition of `to reward´?
Deleted.
. Page 18, Lines 22 – 33: The cognitive bias task can only be used as a relative measure of animal mood i.e. can
only tell us how one group/treatment compares to a control. The authors’ suggestion that animals can be seen
s “categorically” optimistic or pessimistic if they respond to ambiguous cues more or less than expected by
hance is therefore incorrect. Many factors in the task design may influence the chance of an animal
esponding positively to an ambiguous cue, such as the relative outcomes of a Go or No-Go response.
We wrote that it is difficult to interpret animals as ‘categorically’ pessimistic and did not intend to suggest this
was possible. We have modified this paragraph to make it clearer (lines 628 -635).
