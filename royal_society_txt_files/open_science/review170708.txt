This manuscript reports the use of computational (DFT) calculations to help clarify the
mechanism and identify the active species involved in the "blue bottle" experiment that many
chemistry students are familiar with. Overall, the paper is well-written, but the authors should
address the following comments before the paper can be published:
(1) I am over-whelmed by the list of structures presented in Tables 1 and 2. There is no attempt to
explain where some of these structures come from, and it seems almost random. The introduction
needs to be re-written to better explain the origin of these structures, the chemistry behind the
"blue bottle" experiment. I recommend showing a reaction scheme in the intro for the chemical
structures of methylene blue, leucomethylene blue and other relevant species. The authors can
also label the chemicals in the two Tables.
(2) A major concern I have is whether the level of theory is adequate. B3LYP/6-31G* is a very
modest calculation in a modern context. In some cases, modest calculations can deliver
quantitatively accurate results, but this is very system-dependent. Can the authors present some
benchmarking to verify the accuracy of their computational protocol? Otherwise, I am skeptical
about the results presented especially since anionic species are involved. Btw, were the SM8
calculations also carried out at the same level of theory?
(3) It is not clear what is the conclusion of the paper. Has the authors successfully used their
computation to resolve some of the conflicting literature experiments described in the
introduction? It would really help enhance the paper if they could make references to specific
systems.
(4) The authors might also wish to consult the following recent review/benchmarking study for
reference (DOI: 10.1039/C4CP01572J).

The manuscript states that supporting material has been uploaded, but it is not clear how it can
be accessed, so this would need to be corrected before publication. The material seems to consist
of a list of the optimised geometries, where it might have been helpful to see further analysis and
data tables.

This manuscripts relates to the blue bottle experiment which shows a spectacular colour change
in regular intervals. I had not appreciated that this reaction was not fully understood and found
the description of the relevant literature interesting. The authors have used standard DFT
calculations to estimate redox potential and so to suggest alternative reagents. Although the
interpretations and conclusions are just about sound, I have a few concerns about this study,
which are outlined below. I note that I am on the border of recommending rejection in this case,
because I think there is quite a lot of work to be done to improve this.
Anyway, in no particular order:
- It is not very clear which reagents work, perhaps there is too much knowledge assumed - I
would have liked to see some clear reaction schemes.
- It would be good to see explicit comparison with reduction and oxidation potentials from other
sources (experimental or calculated), to see how big discrepancies are and whether these are
systematic, or system-dependent. This would also be enhanced by statistical analysis, e.g.
determining correlation coefficients or attempting some scatter plots.
- This work would have been greatly enhanced by further testing, both of the computational
methodology (do dispersion, basis set (especially diffuse functions), different functionals make a
difference) and of the experimental predictions. At the moment, this seems very weak and
speculative, rather than a helpful scientific study.
- The manuscript is also a tough read - not just is it littered with errors of grammar and
expression (and the term basidic made me smile, because it is logical, albeit wrong (it should be
basic)), but sections are not connected well and assertions are made which are difficult to follow
and relate to the data. Both discussion and data presentation could be improved.
- This is not a deal-breaker, but the figures and structures in tables appear to be of very poor
quality and inconsistent size, at least on my screen, and I also wondered whether presentation
could be improved - it might be better to merge tables 1 and 2, showing the same reagents under
different conditions side by side, for example. I am not convinced that Fig. 2 is particularly
informative without giving chemical detail, and again some correlations between acidic and basic
conditions might be helpful.
In summary, I am not unhappy about the underlying calculations and results, but presentation
and analysis could (and need to be) improved significantly, clearly linking the results with
experimental reality and suggesting (and ideally testing) the most likely candidates for new
reagents.

Comments to the Author:
The reviewers have highlighted numerous issues which must to be addressed including the
clarity of the introduction and discussion sections. In particular, the quality of the computational
method needs to be better assessed. However both reviewers also note that work carried out has
potential and that if improvements are made, would be publishable. Given the magnitude of the
improvements required we would consider a substantially improved manuscript resubmitted in
the future.

I would like to thank the authors for engaging with the reviewing process so thoroughly and
congratulate them on their revised manuscript. I have a couple of minor requests:
In the Methodology section on page 2, they refer to the RT lnQ term which is not explicit
anywhere - I think that would be worth adding.
On line 158, again on page 2, the sentence starting "We use try to use..." makes limited sense and
needs rewriting.
Apart from these, some errors of grammar and expression remain, but I hope these can be
resolved during the editing process, and the references might need to be tidied up.
As an aside, how did the original work in B3LYP/6-31G* compare with the bigger basis set? It

Dear Editor,
Please find attached our manuscript, A DFT investigation of the blue bottle experiment: EOhalf-cell of reducing agents and redox indicators
which we wish to resubmit for publication as a full paper in Royal Society Open Science. We thank the editors and reviewers for their
areful reading and constructive suggestions. In light of their comments, we have substantially revised the manuscript. All points raised by
wo reviewers (6 and 10 points by Reviewer 1 and 2 respectively) are addressed below. Changes are highlighted in yellow in the revised
manuscript for your convenience.
. Introduction
a) I recommend showing a reaction scheme in the intro (Reviewer 1)
b) I would have liked to see some clear reaction schemes. (Reviewer 2)
c) There is no attempt to explain where some of these structures come from, and it seems almost random  introduction needs to be
rewritten to better explain the origin of these structures  (Reviewer 1)
We have revised the introduction to include reaction schemes and to provide explanation why compounds are included in our study.
. Validity of the methodology: benchmarking & further experimental testing
a)  benchmarking to verify the accuracy of their computational protocol?  consult the following recent review/benchmarking
study for reference (DOI: 10.1039/C4CP01572J). (Reviewer 1)
b) It would be good to see explicit comparison with reduction and oxidation potentials from other sources (experimental or
calculated) ... (Reviewer 2)
c) This work would have been greatly enhanced by further testing, both of the computational methodology  and of the
experimental predictions. (Reviewer 2)
d)  the SM8 calculations also carried out at the same level of theory? (Reviewer 1)
e)  suggesting (and ideally testing) the most likely candidates for new reagents. (Reviewer 2)
We have improved the basis set to 6-311++G** and the solvation method to SMD. In addition, benchmarking results calculated by MP2/cc-
VTZ in solution phase and preliminary experimental results are discussed for some representative reactions. References and clarification
egarding methodology have also been added.
. Presentation of results and discussion: tables of reduction potentials, figures & discussion
a) The authors can also label the chemicals in the two Tables. (Reviewer 1)
b)  it might be better to merge tables 1 and 2. (Reviewer 2)
c)  tables appear to be of very poor quality and inconsistent size. (Reviewer 2)
d)  I am not convinced that Fig. 2 is particularly informative without giving chemical detail  (Reviewer 2)
e) Both discussion and data presentation could be improved. (Reviewer 2)
We have followed the two reviewers advices. The contents of the tables have been merged, labelled and the quality of the scheme has been
mproved. New results from amino acids have been added. The discussion of data have also been substantially revised.
. Grammatical errors, flow & conclusion
a)  the term basidic made me smile, because it is logical, albeit wrong  (Reviewer 2)
b)  sections are not connected well and assertions are made which are difficult to follow  (Reviewer 2)
c) It is not clear what is the conclusion of the paper. Has the authors successfully used their computation to resolve some of the
conflicting literature experiments described in the introduction? It would really help enhance the paper if they could make
references to specific systems. (Reviewer 1)
We have copy-edited and proof-read the manuscript again and addressed Reviewer 1 comments in the conclusion.

Review of A DFT investigation of the blue bottle experiment: E<U+25E6>halfcell of reducing agents
and redox indicators
20-Jul-2017
This revised manuscript represents a significant improvement in terms of readability and
clarity. Unfortunately, there are still some issues that need to be addressed before the
paper can be recommended for publication:
Major points:
(1) Page 2, column 1, lines 27-28: The deviation from standard condition should be
relatively small. Can the authors justify this statement please?
(2) Please number all equations for easy reference.
(3) Page 2, column 2, lines 28-30: Gosolv should be Gosoln to differentiate between
solution phase and solvation. The superscript o denote a standard state of 1 bar at
298 K, whereas solution phase thermochemistry has a standard state of 1 mol L-1. Please
also note that when a pure solvent is involved in the reaction, i.e. H2O, the standard
state is also different ~ 1 molal or ~ 55 mol L-1 for water (see for example, JPCA (2005),
109, 10795). It is not clear if the calculated values in Table 1 and correspondingly, Figure
3, reflects the correct standard states. I dont think this will alter the conclusions of this
work, but for the sake of clarity and correctness, please revise the data accordingly.
(4) Related to the above, I also recommend writing out representative half-reaction for each
group of reaction. The notation in Table 1 is easy to follow; however, I think there are
some errors there. Notably, the reduction of O2 under alkaline condition cannot be
O2+2H(+)+2e(-)=2OH(-) as written. Most likely, it is O2+2H2O+2e(-)=4OH(-). The authors
also claim that the hydronium ion was used instead of the bare proton, but this seems
unclear at least from the heading in Table 1.
(5) Point #4 is also related to point #1 regarding non-standard conditions. Under standard
conditions, the [H+] = 1 mol L-1, but this cannot be the case for the calculations under
alkaline conditions so the RTlnQ term is relevant here. The authors need to state exactly
what pH (or proton ion concentration) corresponds to acidic versus alkaline conditions so
that the work is reproducible by other groups. Its all a little vague in the present paper.
(6) Page 2, column 2, lines 41 to 45: a number of typographical errors here.
Minor points:
(1) The authors made some claims in the manuscript, e.g. in the section under
Benchmarking, and should provide a link to the ESI showing the strong correlation
between DFT and MP2 results. Related to this point, I dont think a strong linear
correlation means anything as far as accuracy is concerned. The slope could still deviate
significantly from the ideal value of 1. Its more meaningful to provide mean unsigned
errors.
(2) Similarly, the sentence just above the heading Benchmarking, the authors claim that
the procedure should be sufficiently accurate. Where is the justification?
