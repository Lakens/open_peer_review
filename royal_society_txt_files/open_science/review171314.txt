Great paper.

e authors describe a form of anticipatory synchronization, sensory coupling, which was inspired by
man tracking experiments. In contrast to previous approaches, the authors say that in this case anticipation
ms an integral part of the control loop. The scheme is demonstrated numerically on two simulated
tems and works also for non-constant delays.
is is an interesting contribution but, although from within this field, I have difficulty to understand it. I
ume this is mostly due to lack of clarity in the description and quality of presentation, mostly the figures.
order to be publishable, the manuscript needs to be clear even to people not from this field, so there is
mething to do in order to make this possible. In the following, these problems are detailed. However, I
uld recommend even after having addressed my specific comments, the authors take a step back and
nk of how in general the manuscript could be made more accessible for non-experts in this specific field
application.
general, I have difficulties to understand the differences between the different approaches and how they
ate to delayed tracking experiments. In the tracking experiments, there is an artificial feedback delay, but
an artificial sensory delay. To clarify, maybe all delay terms in the manuscript should be labelled
ether they are feedback or sensory delays, also in the block diagrams. In the same sense, Figures 2 and 4
not fit together; in Figure 4, the leftmost delay is a sensory delay but it is outside of the feedback loop,
ereas in Figure 4 the sensory delays are inside. Later, in section 2.2., things are specified further. I have
feeling that re-structuring the manuscript already could clarify things a bit.

rectly) and then continue with plant only.

ybe it is better not to mention ‘overshooting.’
Figure 5, if anticipation is represented by negative color (blue), then I only see lag for large tau_f, but no
icipation. I am very confused by that figure.

ximum map of the z-coordinate. Otherwise, the trajectories are smooth and pretty predictable. I would

Response to Referee’s Comments
nk you for taking the time to give us such a comprehensive review. We have made an
nsive series of changes to our manuscript as a result, which we hope will go some way to
gating your concerns. The following is an itemised list of your comments as we identified
, followed by our responses and, where appropriate, copies of the revised text and
res.
1. This is an interesting contribution but, although from within this field, I have
difficulty to understand it. I assume this is mostly due to lack of clarity in the
description and quality of presentation, mostly the figures. In order to be publishable,
the manuscript needs to be clear even to people not from this field, so there is
something to do in order to make this possible. In the following, these problems are
detailed. However, I would recommend even after having addressed my specific
comments, the authors take a step back and think of how in general the manuscript
could be made more accessible for non-experts in this specific field of application.
<U+F0B7> First of all, thank you for your helpful comments. We have made significant
changes throughout the paper, but in particular to the introduction, discussion
and conclusion. Hopefully these will improve the readability of our
manuscript and the clarity of the messages we wish to convey.
2. In general, I have difficulties to understand the differences between the different
approaches and how they relate to delayed tracking experiments. In the tracking
experiments, there is an artificial feedback delay, but not an artificial sensory delay.
To clarify, maybe all delay terms in the manuscript should be labelled whether they
are feedback or sensory delays, also in the block diagrams. In the same sense, Figures
2 and 4 do not fit together; in Figure 4, the leftmost delay is a sensory delay but it is
outside of the feedback loop, whereas in Figure 4 the sensory delays are inside. Later,
in section 2.2., things are specified further. I have the feeling that re-structuring the
manuscript already could clarify things a bit.
<U+F0B7> This was a mistake on our part: were some errors in Figure 4 that made it
inconsistent with the other block diagrams. We have updated the block
diagrams so that there is a coherent visual structure linking these figures.
<U+F0B7> Fig 4:
<U+F0B7> Fig 11:
3. “These weaknesses are partly linked to the specific nature of the chaotic dynamics
being used in the slave, which can diverge in value very quickly when subject to
external influence”: Is this correct? The chaotic time scale of this attractor is much
longer than the prediction time used here. Essentially, the chaoticity of the motion
shows up only after several round-trips through phase space, for example in the
maximum-to maximum map of the z-coordinate. Otherwise, the trajectories are
smooth and pretty predictable. I would assume that the same effects would be
observed in non-chaotic systems with some form of non-trivial trajectories, for
example the superposition of several sinusoids.
<U+F0B7> This was a comment specifically on the slave’s stability. Since the slave is
composed the robot dynamics and those of the target (a Rössler oscillator), it
is affected by the Rössler system’s sensitivity to initial conditions. When an
impulse is applied to the plant, the sensory coupling is also disturbed, and this
sensitivity causes the slave to become unstable.
<U+F0B7> “This limitation is linked to the sensitivity to initial conditions of the chaotic
dynamics that represent the target in the slave. These diverge exponentially
from the target's actual movement when the plant, and thus the sensory
coupling, is disturbed. It would be possible to achieve anticipation using less-
sensitive dynamics to represent the target within the slave, but these would no
longer match the target dynamics and thus limit both the anticipation period
and accuracy that can be achieved, resembling more the performance of the
parallel system.”
4. After “The sensory coupling is used in two different ways, distinguished by the nature
of the slave…” another block diagram would be useful to better understand the
distinctions made. Also, for the parallel approach, there is no block diagram?
<U+F0B7> This statement is not clear; we have re-written the introduction and section 3
to make this clearer. Figure 4 is intended to depict the parallel approach -
hopefully this will also be more visible due to our revisions.
<U+F0B7> “We test our hypothesis by using a simulated robot (modelled in Simulink) to
perform a tracking task in the presence of delay. Because of the challenges
specific to this application, namely that the plant can only be controlled by a
torque signal that is defined in a different coordinate system to the target,
there are restrictions on how this coupling can be applied. Nonetheless, we
believe we identified the two most plausible systems.
The `parallel' system couples the plant itself to an internal model that encodes
the `normal' response of the control loop without delays. With both the model
and plant tracking the same target, the plant synchronises with the future state
of the model, anticipating by a sufficient amount to counteract the delays in
the real system.
The `serial' system treats the moving target as the master, with an internal
model predicting its motion. The control signal that corresponds to this
predicted target is calculated and used to control the plant. The output of the
plant, subject to the real system delays, forms the `slave' part of the sensory
coupling and ensures the degree of anticipation is always appropriate. In both
of these cases, anticipation cannot occur without continuous interaction with
the real target and plant, fulfilling on a basic level the requirements of strong
anticipation.”
5. When the authors say “body (plant)”, do they mean the human body? Maybe it would
be better first to mention that “plant” in the following could be the human body or an
artificial plant (if I understand it correctly) and then continue with plant only.
<U+F0B7> We have altered the text to eliminate this ambiguity: “body” is now only used
where we specifically refer to the human body (as part of the inspiration for
the design of the systems), while all other instances are referred to as the plant
(or the “true plant” when making the distinction with a dynamical model of
the model).
6. “This was chosen as a system that is highly nonlinear and difficult to predict in order
to discount trivial `anticipation' due to simply overshooting the target”: What does
this mean? How would an overshooting model look like specifically? Would
overshooting cause apparent anticipation by means of cross-correlation with negative
lag, too, and if yes, why is it to be avoided? If these questions cannot be easily
answered, maybe it is better not to mention ‘overshooting.’
<U+F0B7> This was over-conservative language. There was some concern that the
simulated robot arm, if underdamped, could precede the motion of a
sinusoidal target along one axis, masking the effect of the coupling we had
designed. This effect was never observed, and in any case is not relevant to
the work as presented, so we are happy to remove this statement.
7. In Figure 5, if anticipation is represented by negative color (blue), then I only see lag
for large tau_f, but no anticipation. I am very confused by that figure. Also, it is
unfortunate to use ‘green’ both for small lead and lag. One clearly cannot distinguish,
based on color, what is lead and lag. The color scale should have a discontinuity at
zero to make it meaningful.
<U+F0B7> This is a valid criticism of our choice of colour mapping. To make these
figures more readable, we have altered the false colour mapping such that all
negative lags are represented by shades of blue, while all positive lags grade
from yellow to red. The new versions of figures 6 and 12 are inserted below to
demonstrate this:
8. I agree that it is important to distinguish between AS and the Smith predictor, as the
authors do in the introduction. However, I do not understand the sentence “However,
the output of the controlled object already contains this information, since it is driven
by the slave's output.” Is “controlled object” and “slave” here the same system?
<U+F0B7> Sorry, this was a poorly phrased expression of the idea that if a dynamical
system is created to act as the predictive slave, and its state is used to drive the
control of the true plant, the plant’s output is now a transformed, delayed
version of the slave’s output. Therefore, there should be no need to use a
delayed copy of the slave’s state as feedback, because it can be derived from
the plant. After rewriting the introduction with reference to earlier comments,
this sentence is no longer included, but we have added a paragraph that we
believe clarifies the concept more.
<U+F0B7> “We hypothesise that a control scheme based directly on the strong
anticipation principle and utilising AS can be designed by coupling a correctly
designed dynamical model to the real output of the plant through the sensors -
a sensory coupling. Because the sensed output of the plant is subject to both,
the delays introduced by the plant itself (feedback delay,<U+0001D70F><U+0001D453> ), and those that
result from sensory processing (sensory delay, t), the anticipation period will
always be equal to the true delay within the system. The logic of this principle
is similar to that of `signal bouncing' [14], which avoids modelling network
delay by `bouncing' the output of a predictive model through the delaying
channel itself.
9. The time resolution of the numerical solver is not larger than observed lag times. Isn’t
this a problem? What does prevent one to use an order of magnitude difference, e.g. a
resolution of 0.001 s for the solver?
<U+F0B7> This was primarily a choice to save simulation time, although we did confirm
beforehand that a higher time resolution did not qualitatively change (or, more
specifically, ‘improve’) the results. We do agree that a higher time resolution
would increase the credibility of our conclusions, so we have increased the
time resolution of the simulations used to produce our results to 0.001s.
10. I would replace “weakness” with “limitation”; every method has certain limitations of
applicability, but it does not mean that it is “weak” per se.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for this helpful suggestion; we have corrected the wording
throughout the manuscript.
11. All 2D color plots seem to be unnecessarily smoothed or blurred.
<U+F0B7> The color plots were interpolated in order to remove visible grid lines from the
MATLAB figures. We have switched to a different plotting function that does
not produce grid lines, as well as increasing the resolution, so the colour plots
should no longer appear blurry (as you can see in our response to comment 7).
12. Figure 8: I neither see the mentioned sharp peaks in the target's motion, nor any
oscillations of the effector.
<U+F0B7> We are sorry; this was a reference to a specific feature in the time series for
which “sharp peaks” was a lazy description. We have increased the resolution
of the figure (now figure 7), changed the description and added an inset
comparison showing the feature in question, and the difference in response
<U+F0B7> “Figure 7: X-axis movement of the target (blue, solid line) and the end effector
of the parallel system plant with K = 0.3 (green, dashed line), which must
track it. t = 0.1 s before rising to 0.3 s at the 300 s point. The increase in t
causes the end effector to oscillate more after non-sinusoidal moments of the
target (compare inset figures a and b), but does not cause a proportionate
increase in lag.”
13. There is a recent related, but somewhat different, explanation for human delayed
feedback tracking experiments: H.U. Voss & N. Stepp, A negative group delay model
for feedback-delayed manual tracking performance, Journal of Computational
Neuroscience, 41, 295 – 304 (2016). Preprint:
https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1606/1606.06571.pdf . Not sure if needs to be
mentioned, though. Just FYI.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for bringing this to our attention – since it is relevant to some of the
conclusions we make in the course of the manuscript, we have included
citations to this paper in our introduction (section 1) and general discussion
(section 5)
