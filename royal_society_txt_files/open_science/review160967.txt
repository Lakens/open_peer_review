In this paper the author investigated the post-natal growth of the cranial arteries of the alpaca
(Vicugna pacos), a representative of the new world camels. The author makes use of an
established technique to set the arterial vasculature of the brain of three adult alpacas, as well as
that of a still-born calf (the arterial vasculature of the latter animal’s neck is also described).
Computer tomography was then used to visualize and facilitate the description of the arterial
vasculature without the need for maceration.
The paper is entirely descriptive, detailing the manner in which arterial blood vessels relate to
one another, and the areas they perfuse. There is no statistical analysis.
The author is to be commended for a well-written article. Some specific comments follow below:
Line 19: You state as fact that the carotid contributes to “increased oxygen-haemoglobin binding
affinity”. While there is ample evidence for the role of the carotid rete in facilitating selective
brain cooling there is no evidence in the literature that the carotid rete facilitates oxygen-
haemoglobin binding affinity.
Line 48: Change 4000m to 4000 m
Lines 61-62: I know that this is not a suggestion made by you as such, but I really do struggle to
understand how selective brain cooling would increase the binding of oxygen as the bloodstream
perfuses the brain. Selective brain cooling is very specific in that the hypothalamic region of the
brain is cooled (there is no whole-body cooling as a result of selective brain cooling). I therefore
have to question where this supply of unbound oxygen - that now could be bound because the
blood enroute to the brain is cooler than that of the body core – would come from.
Line 63: Change “brain cooling” to selective brain cooling
Line 65-66: While selective brain cooling certainly plays a role in the conservation of body water,
the papers you cite here (36-52) do not all reflect that fact or even the idea. While I do realise that
your background is most likely not in physiology, it remains essential to carefully read the
literature that one decides to cite.
Line 90: Again, in the absence of any evidence, too much is being made of the role of the carotid
rete in oxygen metabolism.
Line 95: Considering individual variation in terms of vascular arrangement as, for example,
evident in the 2014 paper by Kieltyka-Kurc and colleagues (cited by you), and other such
descriptions, is there not a need to also investigate more than one prenatal specimen to ensure an
adequate description of the prenatal vasculature? This needs to be addressed in the manuscript.
Line 124: A reference is needed here.
Line 156: “…, but this may be an effect of arterial reduction during ontogeny.” I suggest you
remove the quoted section above that seems like speculation, particularly as you address this in
line 318.
Line 184: delete “is” after (a. facialis)
Line 596: Why would the ophthalmic artery be enlarged as indicated in the caption of Figure 2?

label_comment_2
The author has compiled an impressive collection of images and included a detailed description
of the cranial vasculature of the alpaca. The current manuscript has a very strong anatomical
focus with very little interpretation of how that anatomy may relate to function. The background
and hypotheses for the study are interesting in terms of whether a species inhabiting high
altitudes may have unique cranial vasculature, however, the current manuscript fails to
adequately address these aims as the anatomical description of the blood vessels is not placed
within a comparative anatomy context, for example, how does the cranial vasculature of an
alpaca differ from a camelid which is not adapted to high altitude?
There also appears to be a disconnect between the background and results presented. The
background has a strong focus on the carotid rete and the potential advantages of the carotid rete
for a species living at high altitudes, yet there is very little reference to the rete in the anatomical
description (line 237-245 & 267 & 344-346) and no indication of how the alpaca’s rete compares to
closely-related species which are not exposed to high altitudes. In fact, the carotid rete in the
stillborn alpaca was smaller than that observed in other species at birth (line 345), which may
contradict original hypotheses.
Furthermore, some of the arguments for why a carotid rete may be advantageous at high
altitudes are counterintuitive. For example, why would an increased binding of oxygen to
hemoglobin in blood perfusing the brain (line 62) be an advantage? An increased affinity of
oxygen for haemoglobin at low temperatures will reduce the oxygen delivered to the brain,
which combined with an already low partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude, would be
counter adaptive. Indeed, one of the long-term adaptations to altitude in humans is an increase in
2,3 BPG, which causes a right shift in the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve to deliver more
oxygen to tissues ie opposite to the mechanism proposed here. The reference cited in support of
this hypothesis (Caputa 2004) simply suggested that brain cooling in birds may protect the brain
from hypoxic damage, but he did not proposed a mechanisms and recommended further
research be conducted There are a number of other references which are miscited, for example, in
line 66 references 41-47 made no measure of selective brain cooling. The author should take care
in cross checking that references are accurately cited.
Minor comments:
Line 47. It is unclear why reference to humans relevant here.

Line 55. How is venous blood warmed by maxilloturbinates?
Line 63. “In the arid habitats of Camelini, the carotid rete plays a role in brain cooling” The
potential for the rete to cool the brain should be listed first and more details given in terms of the
benefit of a cooler brain at high altitudes. Also, both of the references cited were laboratory
studies, so why are arid habitats highlighted?
Line 65. Why would the eye be particularly sensitive to thermal damage?
Line 98. Were heads flushed before being frozen or fixed in formaldehyde?
Line 102. Is there any difference between left and right cranial vasculature? Would it have been
better to standardize measurements on a single side?
Line 124. Include a reference for the reliability of the technique.
Line 128. What is meant by “minimal use of smoothing algorithms”? Can you quantify the
smoothing relative to other studies using the same technique? Would arteries need to be
smoothed to account for individual variation between specimens? Are the figures presented that
of a single representative individual of smoothed for all samples? Were there differences in the
anatomy of male and female individuals? Is the sample size adequate/standard for this type of
technique?

Comments to the Author(s)
In this paper the author investigated the post-natal growth of the cranial arteries of the alpaca
(Vicugna pacos), a representative of the new world camels. The author makes use of an
established technique to set the arterial vasculature of the brain of three adult alpacas, as well as
that of a still-born calf (the arterial vasculature of the latter animal’s neck is also described).
Computer tomography was then used to visualize and facilitate the description of the arterial
vasculature without the need for maceration.
The paper is entirely descriptive, detailing the manner in which arterial blood vessels relate to
one another, and the areas they perfuse. There is no statistical analysis.
The author is to be commended for a well-written article. Some specific comments follow below:
Line 19: You state as fact that the carotid contributes to “increased oxygen-haemoglobin binding
affinity”. While there is ample evidence for the role of the carotid rete in facilitating selective
brain cooling there is no evidence in the literature that the carotid rete facilitates oxygen-
haemoglobin binding affinity.
This clause has been removed from the abstract. Line 18 now ends with SBC only.
Line 48: Change 4000m to 4000 m
The relevant line has been removed.
Lines 61-62: I know that this is not a suggestion made by you as such, but I really do struggle to
understand how selective brain cooling would increase the binding of oxygen as the bloodstream
perfuses the brain. Selective brain cooling is very specific in that the hypothalamic region of the
brain is cooled (there is no whole-body cooling as a result of selective brain cooling). I therefore
have to question where this supply of unbound oxygen - that now could be bound because the
blood enroute to the brain is cooler than that of the body core – would come from.
This is an excellent point made by both reviewers. I am happy to remove these lines from the
manuscript.
Line 63: Change “brain cooling” to selective brain cooling
Line 59 has been updated.
Line 65-66: While selective brain cooling certainly plays a role in the conservation of body
water, the papers you cite here (36-52) do not all reflect that fact or even the idea. While I do
realise that your background is most likely not in physiology, it remains essential to carefully
read the literature that one decides to cite.
A more conservative list of references has been cited. Specifically, references 41-47 have been
removed.
Line 90: Again, in the absence of any evidence, too much is being made of the role of the carotid
rete in oxygen metabolism.
The role of the rete in oxygen metabolism has been minimized in the introduction, with numerous
lines removed from the paragraph between Lines 51-66.
Line 95: Considering individual variation in terms of vascular arrangement as, for example,
evident in the 2014 paper by Kieltyka-Kurc and colleagues (cited by you), and other such
descriptions, is there not a need to also investigate more than one prenatal specimen to ensure an
adequate description of the prenatal vasculature? This needs to be addressed in the manuscript.
Additional specimens are highly desirable, however, early ontogenetic stages are extremely rare.
The single stillborn specimen described is, unfortunately, the result of several years of waiting. I
have added a few points of discussion regarding availability of specimens to the manuscript:
Line 292:
“A single stillborn alpaca was available as a representative of early developmental
stages.”
Lines 389 to 391:
“Low specimen numbers should be interpreted conservatively, and future studies
should focus on the inclusion of additional specimens, particularly earlier
ontogenetic stages.”
It is perhaps also relevant to note that the majority of variation found by the detailed work of
Kieltyka-Kurc et al. is within the branching pattern of the cerebral arterial circle, and not
necessarily within the branching patterns of major arteries. This contribution defers to their
study with respect to cerebral and cerebellar vasculature, as their multi-species, comparative
dataset within camelids is more suitable to address these patterns. Whether this variation reflects
overall patterning will require a larger dataset, in terms of both specimens and species, than is
available in the Kieltyka-Kurc dataset as well as my own.
Line 124: A reference is needed here.
These lines relate to the utility of basic Avizo functions (now Lines 116-122). These are standard
procedures as defined by the Avizo manual.
Line 156: “…, but this may be an effect of arterial reduction during ontogeny.” I suggest you
remove the quoted section above that seems like speculation, particularly as you address this in
line 318.
These lines have been clarified for context, with respect to discrepant hard and soft tissue
patterns in artiodactyl basicranial morphology (now Lines 145-153). The artiodactyl basicranial
morphology community will be familiar with a pattern wherein the internal carotid artery is
poorly developed, however its conventional osteological correlates are not. The most likely
explanation for this is ontogenetic changes. The section between Lines 149 and 153 now reads:
“The ventral surface of the petrosal is scoured by a slight transpromontorial sulcus.
This sulcus corresponds to direct contact by the internal carotid artery of non-
artiodactylan mammals (Van Kampen, 1905; Conroy and Wible, 1978; Cartmill,
MacPhee, and Simons 1981; MacPhee, 1981; Wible, 1983; O’Leary, 2010);
however, in the adult alpaca, the ICA does not make direct contact with the petrosal.
The presence of a transpromontorial sulcus in adult alpacas may be an effect of
arterial reduction during ontogeny (see below).”
Line 184: delete “is” after (a. facialis)
Removed.
Line 596: Why would the ophthalmic artery be enlarged as indicated in the caption of Figure 2?
This reference is to the ophthalmic rete, rather than the ophthalmic artery. The enlargement is a
rete rather than a single artery.

Comments to the Author(s)
The author has compiled an impressive collection of images and included a detailed description
of the cranial vasculature of the alpaca. The current manuscript has a very strong anatomical
focus with very little interpretation of how that anatomy may relate to function. The background
and hypotheses for the study are interesting in terms of whether a species inhabiting high
altitudes may have unique cranial vasculature, however, the current manuscript fails to
adequately address these aims as the anatomical description of the blood vessels is not placed
within a comparative anatomy context, for example, how does the cranial vasculature of an
alpaca differ from a camelid which is not adapted to high altitude?
Although adding comparative specimens would be beyond the scope of a revision, I have added
lines to the discussion comparing the morphology of alpaca arteries to the descriptions provided
by Kieltyka-Kurc. Overall, the cranial arteries of Old and New World camelids are relatively
conserved, so morphology in this case may be more so the result of phylogeny than function.
Lines 366 to 372 now read:
“Overall, the major cranial arterial branching patterns of the alpaca do not differ
significantly from those studied in a comparative context by Kieltyka-Kurc and
colleagues (2014), nor do they differ significantly from the patterns detailed for
the domestic dromedary (Kanan, 1970; Smuts and Bezuidenhout, 1987; Ocal et
al., 1999). New and Old World camelids inhabit strikingly different habitats
which may promote their own unique demands on the animals’ cardiovascular
systems. That there are few major discrepancies between the arteries supplying
the head and carotid rete of these animals suggests that the cranial vascular
patterns of camelids reflect phylogeny rather than function.”
There also appears to be a disconnect between the background and results presented. The
background has a strong focus on the carotid rete and the potential advantages of the carotid rete
for a species living at high altitudes, yet there is very little reference to the rete in the anatomical
description (line 237-245 & 267 & 344-346) and no indication of how the alpaca’s rete compares
to closely-related species which are not exposed to high altitudes. In fact, the carotid rete in the
stillborn alpaca was smaller than that observed in other species at birth (line 345), which may
contradict original hypotheses.
The discussion that followed line 345 attempted to address that this seeming contradiction may
be due to developmental factors, rather than environmental. Lines 339 to 357 have been clarified
to stress this point:
“Interestingly, the ophthalmic and carotid retia are already reasonably well
developed in the stillborn specimen. The full formation of the ophthalmic rete in
early ontogeny may be due to the fact that the ophthalmic vessels condense from
large vascular plexuses consisting of the primordial ophthalmic, nasal, ethmoidal,
and cerebral vessels (Padgett, 1948). The extent of the carotid rete may result from
a different mechanism, which requires further investigation on comparative
anatomical and proximate, mechanistic scales. Compared to other non-camelid
artiodactyls, the carotid rete of the stillborn alpaca, although well-developed, is
somewhat smaller than expected at parturition. This may be due to the presence of
a patent ICA. By birth, Sus, Ovis, Capra, and Giraffa possess retia that occupy
nearly the entire floor of the basicranium, in absence of an ICA (Tandler, 1899;
Daniel, Dawes, and Prichard, 1953; Wible, 1984; O’Brien et al., 2016). Contrarily,
in Bos and Bison, which maintain patent ICA’s at birth (Daniel, Dawes, and
Prichard, 1953; Bamel, Dhingra, and Sharma, 1975), the carotid rete does not yet
fill the compartment lateral to the sella turcica––a similar extent to that of the
stillborn alpaca. Wible (1984) notes that early artiodactyl embryos maintain a
tubular internal carotid artery associated with the intracranial surface of the
basisphenoid. These studies suggest that the ICA is initially formed in artiodactyls,
but degenerates or becomes stenotic across development. This degeneration may
result in hypoxia to the lateral sellar compartment. Hypoxia is a known mechanism
for the recruitment of vascular endothelial growth factors (Kim, Moon, and Kim,
2012). The potential linkage between ICA obliteration, hypoxia, and rete formation
should be explored in further detail and in a mechanistic context to resolve whether
rete ontogeny is influenced by intrinsic developmental processes, or extrinsic
factors, such as altitude and environment.”
Furthermore, some of the arguments for why a carotid rete may be advantageous at high altitudes
are counterintuitive. For example, why would an increased binding of oxygen to hemoglobin in
blood perfusing the brain (line 62) be an advantage? An increased affinity of oxygen for
haemoglobin at low temperatures will reduce the oxygen delivered to the brain, which combined
with an already low partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude, would be counter adaptive.
Indeed, one of the long-term adaptations to altitude in humans is an increase in 2,3 BPG, which
causes a right shift in the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve to deliver more oxygen to
tissues ie opposite to the mechanism proposed here. The reference cited in support of this
hypothesis (Caputa 2004) simply suggested that brain cooling in birds may protect the brain from
hypoxic damage, but he did not proposed a mechanisms and recommended further research be
conducted There are a number of other references which are miscited, for example, in line 66
references 41-47 made no measure of selective brain cooling. The author should take care in
cross checking that references are accurately cited.
References 41-47 have been removed at the request of the reviewer. The introductory discussion
regarding oxygen binding has been removed. The section now reads more conservatively to
reflect the speculation of Caputa:
Lines 57-58: “First, the carotid rete may protect the brain from altitude hypoxia,
as suggested by Caputa (2004).”
Minor comments:
Line 47. It is unclear why reference to humans relevant here.
This line and its references have been removed.
Line 55. How is venous blood warmed by maxilloturbinates?
Transfer of heat from expired air during exhalation.
Line 63. “In the arid habitats of Camelini, the carotid rete plays a role in brain cooling” The
potential for the rete to cool the brain should be listed first and more details given in terms of the
benefit of a cooler brain at high altitudes. Also, both of the references cited were laboratory
studies, so why are arid habitats highlighted?
These studies are cited because they quantify a physiology thought to have adaptive significance
in the animal’s habitat.
Line 65. Why would the eye be particularly sensitive to thermal damage?
Acute and chronic damage from hyperthermia have been reported for the cornea, retina, and
eyelids. Although there are no detailed functional studies of the ophthalmic retia of artiodactyls,
Arad, Midtgård and Bernstein (1987) report the function of the avian ophthalmic rete as
preventing overheating of the ocular tissue. Nonetheless, Lines 60 and 61 now much more
conservatively read, “…may further play a role in mediating the temperature of the globe of the
eye…” Finally, a reference to an additional review of tissue-specific thermal tolerances has been
added
Line 98. Were heads flushed before being frozen or fixed in formaldehyde?
It is unfortunately not possible to know the answer to this question, as specimens were preserved
by non-university veterinarians prior to my arrival at Ohio University. The frozen specimens
perfused incredibly well, so it is likely they were flushed and preserved carefully.
Line 102. Is there any difference between left and right cranial vasculature? Would it have been
better to standardize measurements on a single side?
Pattern-wise, no differences were found between left and right sides. No measurements were
taken, however, if they had been, there would very likely be differences between the perfused
(cannulated) side and the non-perfused side.
Line 124. Include a reference for the reliability of the technique.
This is a standard technique in Avizo; however, the reference to reliability has been removed
from Line 120.
Line 128. What is meant by “minimal use of smoothing algorithms”? Can you quantify the
smoothing relative to other studies using the same technique?
This refers to the digital rendering settings of Avizo. When the digital images are rendered by the
program, the user can select from a sliding-scale between 0 and 10 for how much “smoothing”
the program should add to the visualization as it’s created. Most studies employing digital
anatomical rendering do not report their use or degree of smoothing, although they probably
should so as to indicate the degree of voxel “pruning” which can result from higher degrees of
smoothing. I have added a parenthetical on Line 124 clarifying that the smoothing algorithm
was a setting of 2 on a scale of 10.
Would arteries need to be smoothed to account for individual variation between specimens?
This step is strictly for the purpose of generating a visualization rather than data manipulation.
Since the program renders individual cubic voxels, each image would look like a series of very,
very small “Lego” blocks stuck together without the aid of smoothing algorithms.
Are the figures presented that of a single representative individual of smoothed for all samples?
Each image is a single specimen- the figures presented are not a composite. I hope I am reading
this question correctly and that it adequately addresses the concern raised.
Were there differences in the anatomy of male and female individuals?
There were no appreciable differences in major branching patterns for any of the specimens–
See Lines 132 to 133: “Overall, the branching patterns of cranial arteries were conserved
among adult specimens.”
Is the sample size adequate/standard for this type of technique?
Yes– although having more specimens is always desirable, specimens of this nature are
extremely difficult to acquire. This sample size is the result of 6 years of specimen accumulation.
Within the anatomical works cited in this submission, the average specimen count per species is
between 1 and 7 individuals. Studies with greater specimen counts are rare and include
exclusively domestic animals raised for meat or kept as house pets (e.g. cows, pigs, cats, dogs).
Line 184. Typo “the facial artery (a. facialis) is has a separate origin”
