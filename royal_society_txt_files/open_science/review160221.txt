Joseph Nuth’s Review of “Dust evolution, a global view: I. Nano-particles, nascence, nitrogen and
natural selection . . . joining the dots” by Anthony Jones for Royal Society Open Science
I admit to having a great deal of difficulty with the review of this manuscript. It is not a research
paper. Instead it is much more an introduction to the two un-included manuscripts in this series
(references 3 & 4) and possibly a summary of the last few years of research by the authors and his
colleagues. References to the author’s previous work make up more than 40% of the reference list
and there is no discussion of how the assertions made in this manuscript compare with any that
are already in the literature. There are definitely some previous literature citations that are
missing. In addition, there are a number of large-scale sweeping statements that are made
authoritatively but are backed by nothing but some superficial hand-waving. While most of these
flaws are acceptable in an introductory chapter of a series (where the real meat of the arguments
is made in the later papers) or in a review of the author’s own work, such criticisms would
normally be grounds for a minimum recommendation for revision of the manuscript. I will leave
this to the discretion of the editor – who should at least have access to the contents of references 3
& 4 – the next two manuscripts in this apparently continuous series.
On a minor level – and as a matter of personal preference- I am not a big fan of making up words
as we go along, even if they are put into quotations, or of using standard words to have meanings
greatly different than the primary meaning. The term “arophatic” meant to describe a carbon
molecule with both aliphatic and aromatic components is an example of the former – and is
completely unnecessary as there is no real difficulty is expressing the meaning in standard terms
using just a few additional words. The use of the term “nascence” to describe the activity of the
surface to react with incoming atoms or molecules is an illustration of the latter. Again, there is
no advantage to this term. First, the primary meaning has no real relationship to the meaning
expounded in the manuscript and could therefore be quite confusing. Second, the meaning can
easily be expressed using normal words such as “catalytically active surface.” There is no reason
to make things any more confusing for the general astrophysics or astrochemical communities
than is necessary. As an example – on page 4 of the manuscript, in the section on “Nascence” the
authors have the illustration “Thus, nascent interstellar nano-particles could be an important
driver of interstellar chemistry in transition regions where they are abundant, the gas density is
high enough…” If this term became one frequently used by the author, a typical reader would be
mislead into believing that he were referring to newly formed nano-particles, rather than
understanding that he meant that such grains had exceptionally active surfaces.
While the author describes the THEMIS (a very bad acronym) dust model quite nicely, and also
references the models of Mathis & Whiffen, Greenberg and Jones et al., the manuscript fails to
make clear the much more complex nature of the THEMIS model compared to these previous
models, and does not compare the very much higher surface area of the dust in the THEMIS
model than was assumed in previous models. While the author cites the formation of hydrogen
molecules on dust surfaces as the initial driver for grain surface chemistry, he does not cite the
first papers to propose that process (Hollenbach & Salpeter, 1970, JCP 53, 79; 1971, Ap.J., 163,
155). In a similar vein the hydrogenation and de-hydrogenation of carbonaceous dust has been
known for a long time (Hecht, 1986, Ap.J. 305, 817; Sorrell, 1990, MNRAS, 243, 570; 1991, MNRAS,
248, 439), yet appropriate literature was not cited. If the manuscript is a review of the author’s
work, this may be acceptable; as an overview of the field, it is not. Note that these are simply
examples, as there are many more fundamental citations missing.
3
The author gives some generally useful formulae for the adsorption of H atoms onto
carbonaceous surfaces and for the photolysis of such CH bonds starting on page 4 and extends
these general formulae to interactions with heavier species in the following pages. However, it
should be obvious to the reader from the discussion immediately following equation 4.3 that all
such formulae need to be taken with very large grains of salt as none of the parameters is free
from conjecture. This is a positive statement as it honestly reflects our current understanding of
the relevant parameters going in to the cited calculations, yet it only skims the surface. As an
example, why use a single cross section for the H atom reaction with carbon when the author
makes a point that these reactive grains contain single, double (and even triple) bonded carbon
connected in aliphatic chains as well as in aromatic rings with potential products that could be H
bonded to primary, secondary or tertiary carbons? Similarly, why use a single photo-dissociative
cross section for CH bonded in all of these potential configurations? The cross sections used in the
illustrations are certainly not weighted averages of well-measured reactions, rather they are a
best guess, good to (maybe) a few orders of magnitude. Unfortunately, the impression one gets
from reading the discussion following equation 4.3 is that it is significant that the result was 0.4
rather than blind luck or appropriate choices for the exact values used in the equation.
The author’s selectivity gets progressively worse as the discussion moves to the more
complicated species that could result from reaction of heavier species with the carbonaceous dust.
As examples, the potential addition of O or N across CC double bonds could certainly occur,
though the cross sections (even if they were known) would be highly specific to the reaction site
on the dust grain, as would the photolytic lifetime and H reaction rate. Furthermore, in the case
of generating both the OH and NH radicals, no mention is made of the rate at which the OH and
NH bonds, while the species are still bonded into the dust, is photolyzed by FUV photons. Is it
really clear that a FUV photon so preferentially releases “XH” from the grains that the in situ
destruction of the XH bond does not even need to be mentioned? Similarly the assumption that
the sticking coefficient for O or N is about unity no matter where it actually strikes a
carbonaceous grain appears to be pure fantasy and I would suspect that such coefficients would
be orders of magnitude smaller. Given just the two assumptions discussed above, the author’s
observation that the model predictions of the OH abundances in the low density ISM appear to
coincide with observations given in the middle of page 7 appears to be an amazing coincidence.
While the reactions illustrated in Figures 3 & 4 could occur, I see no evidence in the manuscript to
support the assertion that these routes would be a preferred (or even likely) outcome of the
reaction. In fact, if I read the symbols correctly, the fragments are bound into the larger structure,
hindering release of the fragment in reaction 3 and hindering the formation of the CNC bond set
in Figure 4 due to the strain associated with pinning the reactants into the initial configuration in
the larger grain. Again, I am not arguing that such reactions do not occur, merely that no
evidence is presented to support the wish of the author that they do occur.
In the discussion of the presence of long alkyl side groups in the model population of the
asphaltenes used as a framework, the author takes the discussion with very few steps to the
molecular evolution of hemoglobin and chlorophyll. However, the first thing to occur to me was
the question, “Why aren’t any long side groups photolyzed and lost in the ISM?” While the large
scale structure of the framework dust grain will preserve most carbon atoms bound within from
loss by single FUV photons, this is not true of side chains (as opposed to linkages). Cutting any
CC bond in a side chain will result in the loss of all carbon atoms not directly connected to the
grain structure. For this reason, it would seem to this reader that long residence in the ISM
should eliminate such side chains from the dust grains.
Finally, as probably 99% of the ISM’s silicate grain population either melts or vaporizes in the
inner solar system (compare the ISM grain size distribution to that in meteorite matrices) why
should ISM grains (whose mass is concentrated in very small grains) survive in protostellar
4
nebulae? The small grains would be easily oxidized and converted to CO. While I admire trying
to apply the current work to all of the chemical processes in the known universe, this is clearly a
stretch too far. The probability that such molecules were even remotely responsible for the
evolution of biological systems seems vanishingly small, especially if similar kerogens-like
structures could be formed in the nebulae themselves.
I have looked through the two attached manuscripts and it does appear that the first manuscript
is something of an introduction to the other two, though this is not exactly obvious from reading
any of the three. The manuscript still requires revision along the lines of the specific comments in
my review, but these could be accomplished without a complete re-write of the initial
manuscript. I would still drop mention of the bio-molecules and would add more references to
the older, original papers on the various topics mentioned so as to allow comparison of the new
dust model with former hypotheses. I would also drop "nascence" and "arophatic" from the text.

label_comment_2
This paper highlights the potential importance of nanoparticles in interstellar chemistry with a
particular eye toward the formation of precursors to biologically important molecules. The
exploration of potential pathways to formation in the context of a realistic dust model, as well as
the synthesis of a many-threaded narrative into a coherent account of the role of nanoparticles,
renders this paper, in my opinion, worthy of publication.
However, I regret that I cannot recommend publication as-is. While the topic at hand is by nature
somewhat speculative, this work often offers plausible hypotheses without adequate quantitative
justification (e.g. the kangaroo's tail scenario). Further, this paper suffers from inadequate
referencing-- very little background is given to place this work (and indeed this body of work) in
context of the existing literature.
Below, I summarize my major comments on the paper and then present a few minor comments
for consideration.
5
Major Comments
1. As can be gleaned from the abstract, this work has three principal conclusions: A) nanoparticles
may have a key role in OH production in the ISM, B) asphaltenes moieties provide a means of
understanding aromatic carbonaceous grains, and C) nitrogen doping, even at low levels, can
have large impacts on the surface chemistry and observational signatures of grains. I will address
each of these below:
1A. While I felt the discussion of OH formation was quite good, it seriously lacked context. For
instance, what is the current thinking on how OH is formed? Is the proposed mechanism solving
a known problem? Or is it suggesting formation rates via other pathways might be
overestimated?
1B. As indicated by the sentence "The asphaltene morphologies are described and analyzed in
more detail in the following paper in this series," the asphaltene discussion feels incomplete.
There is no justification, aside from citations to other works (some unpublished) that
convincingly illustrates an association between asphaltenes and carbonaceous interstellar grains.
While such an association is plausible, and it seems fine to speculate this is the case, this paper is
quite far from convincing a reasonable reader that "asphaltenes likely provide a viable model for
the structures present within aromatic-rich interstellar carbonaceous grains." Perhaps better
would be "We comment on the structural similarities between asphaltenes and biologically
important molecules such as chlorophyll, and the similarities between aromatic-rich moieties
observed in terrestrial asphaltenes and aromatic carbonaceous grains abundant in the interstellar
medium." The last paragraph of Section 5 may be better moved to Section 3 to make this
connection clearer.
1C. It is claimed that nitrogen doping has "important and observable consequences." Yet, I find no
elucidation as to what these observable signatures are nor comparisons to observations. Indeed,
the conclusions state that "the direct association of nitrogen with any observable measure of dust
in the low density ISM has yet to be made." Aside from the proposed structures in Figures 4 and
5, substantive discussion of the effects of nitrogen doping appear scant. Further, energetics of the
reactions illustrated in those figures does not appear to be discussed.
2. In my comment 1 above, I highlighted several cases in which this work is lacking in
quantitative detail. Another critical such instance is the discussion of the "kangaroo's tail" and the
"jelly bowl." While these analogies are clever and illustrative, they should be backed up with
quantification of the energetics-- are the proposed tails of sufficient size to dissipate the energy
associated with a typical UV photon? Will the tail break off? Likewise the "long alkane chain"
discussed in the last paragraph of Section 5.
3. In my comment 1A above, I highlighted a lack of references to the relevant literature. A more
egregious example of this is the introduction, which cites a mere two papers, both by the author.
Interstellar nanoparticles may not have received the attention they have deserved, but they
haven't been neglected completely! An introduction placing this work in the context of the
existing literature is absolutely essential.
Minor Comments
1. All quoted interstellar abundances should be given a reference.
2. It may be worth mentioning AME as an astrophysical process
associated with nanoparticles.
3. Section 4b should make some mention of the typical bond strengths
of heavy elements.
6
4. The conclusions discuss N-doping as a possible explanation for
DIBs, yet this was not a focus of the present paper.
5. The last sentence of the paper regarding intelligence falls far
outside the scope of the work and should be deleted.

I am happy to report that indeed this manuscript is much improved relative to the initial version
and overall suitable for publication. I have but a few minor suggestions that I hope would be
incorporated in the final manuscript.
1. In Section 3b, it is stated that "Increased internal energies (due to absorbed photons) will then
likely flip the floppy aliphatic/olefinic bridges into new structural states, a process that is not
possible with the more rigid aromatic domains." While this is certainly plausible, effort should be
made to compare quantitatively the relative energies of absorbed photons and the structural
changes in the various geometries. It is unclear, for instance, how many orders of magnitude
separate the energy required to restructure an aromatic vs aliphatic domain.
13
2. In the penultimate paragraph of the introduction, it is stated that the "bottom-up" approach of
modeling dust is not without its problems due to uncertainty as to whether PAHs will retain their
aromaticity in harshly irradiated environments. I would argue that that is far from the only
uncertainty inherent in such "bottom-up" approaches (and indeed the caveats raised in this very
paper would agree); thus, this sentence should be modified, perhaps with a simple "for instance"
or a brief listing of the principal unknowns such approaches must contend with.
3. In the last paragraph of Section 4a, it is argued that "moderate extinction will likely tip the
balance in favour of hydrogenation." While the text leading up to that statement renders it
plausible that this might be the case, the uncertainties are in my mind too great, and too little
justification is provided, to argue that this possibility is "likely."

Joseph Nuth’s Review of “Dust evolution, a global view: I. Nano-particles, nascence, nitrogen and
natural selection . . . joining the dots” by Anthony Jones for Royal Society Open Science
I admit to having a great deal of difficulty with the review of this manuscript. It is not a research
paper. Instead it is much more an introduction to the two un-included manuscripts in this series
(references 3 & 4) and possibly a summary of the last few years of research by the authors and his
colleagues. References to the author’s previous work make up more than 40% of the reference list and
there is no discussion of how the assertions made in this manuscript compare with any that are already
in the literature. There are definitely some previous literature citations that are missing. In addition,
there are a number of large-scale sweeping statements that are made authoritatively but are backed by
nothing but some superficial hand-waving. While most of these flaws are acceptable in an introductory
chapter of a series (where the real meat of the arguments is made in the later papers) or in a review of
the author’s own work, such criticisms would normally be grounds for a minimum recommendation for
revision of the manuscript. I will leave this to the discretion of the editor – who should at least have
access to the contents of references 3 & 4 – the next two manuscripts in this apparently continuous
series.
>>> Actually, when these three papers were submitted I had asked that the referee of a given part also
have access to the other two parts. Apparently, this did not happen and I apologise for this, which
obviously made the review process rather disjointed.
On a minor level – and as a matter of personal preference- I am not a big fan of making up words as we
go along, even if they are put into quotations, or of using standard words to have meanings greatly
different than the primary meaning. The term “arophatic” meant to describe a carbon molecule with both
aliphatic and aromatic components is an example of the former – and is completely unnecessary as
there is no real difficulty is expressing the meaning in standard terms using just a few additional words.
The use of the term “nascence” to describe the activity of the surface to react with incoming atoms or
molecules is an illustration of the latter. Again, there is no advantage to this term. First, the primary
meaning has no real relationship to the meaning expounded in the manuscript and could therefore be
quite confusing. Second, the meaning can easily be expressed using normal words such as “catalytically
active surface.” There is no reason to make things any more confusing for the general astrophysics or
astrochemical communities than is necessary. As an example – on page 4 of the manuscript, in the
section on “Nascence” the authors have the illustration “Thus, nascent interstellar nano-particles could
be an important driver of interstellar chemistry in transition regions where they are abundant, the gas
density is high enough…” If this term became one frequently used by the author, a typical reader would
be mislead into believing that he were referring to newly formed nano-particles, rather than
understanding that he meant that such grains had exceptionally active surfaces.
>>> In fact we have already used the term “arophatic" in our work as an alternative to the acronym
AALH (aromatic-aliphatic-linked hydrocarbons) usually used in studies of soot formation and
carbonaceous nano-particle structure.
However, for this manuscript I have dropped its usage in the paper, except for a single mention.
>>> Nascence, as applied to nano-particle reactivity, is not a usage that I have coined. However, as the
referee states, it is used in relation to the enhanced chemical activity of “fresh” nano-particles. So, yes, I
have to eat humble pie and agree with the referee that I had used the term incorrectly.
I have corrected this in the revised version by keeping the term but by explaining why, in my view, IS
nano-particles should be considered as nascent in the true sense of the word.
While the author describes the THEMIS (a very bad acronym) dust model quite nicely, and also
references the models of Mathis & Whiffen, Greenberg and Jones et al., the manuscript fails to make
clear the much more complex nature of the THEMIS model compared to these previous models, and
does not compare the very much higher surface area of the dust in the THEMIS model than was
assumed in previous models. While the author cites the formation of hydrogen molecules on dust
surfaces as the initial driver for grain surface chemistry, he does not cite the first papers to propose that
hydrogenation and de-hydrogenation of carbonaceous dust has been known for a long time (Hecht,
1986, Ap.J. 305, 817; Sorrell, 1990, MNRAS, 243, 570; 1991, MNRAS, 248, 439), yet appropriate
literature was not cited. If the manuscript is a review of the author’s work, this may be acceptable; as
an overview of the field, it is not. Note that these are simply examples, as there are many more
fundamental citations missing.
>>> The acronym THEMIS is already in relatively wide usage and so it looks like it is here to stay.
Indeed, the THEMIS model is perhaps more complex than previous models but not significantly so. Its
success at explaining so many dust observables appears is principally due to due to the incorporation of
more realistic optical constants.
The larger dust cross-section, especially in nano-particles, in THEMIS is a consequence of the new
optical and physical properties, which then determined the size distribution required to match the
observations. However, the aim here is not to give a review of the THEMIS model but to give the reader
enough information to be able to understand its general outline. Any reader interested in the full details
of the model would have to read the original papers.
Nevertheless, the referee points to several references on carbon grain hydrogenation that were not
included in earlier papers. This is indeed an oversight and so these, and other works, have now been
mentioned here and some of them are now also cited in paper III.
The literature referencing has now also been considerably improved.
The author gives some generally useful formulae for the adsorption of H atoms onto carbonaceous
surfaces and for the photolysis of such CH bonds starting on page 4 and extends these general formulae
to interactions with heavier species in the following pages. However, it should be obvious to the reader
from the discussion immediately following equation 4.3 that all such formulae need to be taken with
very large grains of salt as none of the parameters is free from conjecture. This is a positive statement
as it honestly reflects our current understanding of the relevant parameters going in to the cited
calculations, yet it only skims the surface.
>>> Thank you.
As an example, why use a single cross section for the H atom reaction with carbon when the author
makes a point that these reactive grains contain single, double (and even triple) bonded carbon
connected in aliphatic chains as well as in aromatic rings with potential products that could be H bonded
to primary, secondary or tertiary carbons? Similarly, why use a single photo-dissociative cross section
for CH bonded in all of these potential configurations? The cross sections used in the illustrations are
certainly not weighted averages of well-measured reactions, rather they are a best guess, good to
(maybe) a few orders of magnitude. Unfortunately, the impression one gets from reading the discussion
following equation 4.3 is that it is significant that the result was 0.4 rather than blind luck or appropriate
choices for the exact values used in the equation.
>>> Ideally one should use the appropriate and measured cross-sections for each different interaction
but as far as I am aware few of these have actually been measured. I had thought that I was using the
most appropriate experimental values for a-C:H materials, where available, which actually seem to
agree within a factor of a few. Thus, I would consider that they are better than a best guess and would
argue that using these measured values for all interactions is somewhat better than guesswork.
The author’s selectivity gets progressively worse as the discussion moves to the more complicated
species that could result from reaction of heavier species with the carbonaceous dust. As examples, the
potential addition of O or N across CC double bonds could certainly occur, though the cross sections
(even if they were known) would be highly specific to the reaction site on the dust grain, as would the
photolytic lifetime and H reaction rate.
>>> As a chemist I would have thought that the reaction across an olefinic C=C bond has only a rather
weak dependence on its local environment, as is the case being considered. Although clearly, olefinic
and aromatic sites would be expected to be somewhat different in their energetics, the latter is not
being considered here, i.e., addition across an aromatic CC bond.
The photolytic lifetime is now discussed (see next remark).
Normally, the H atom reaction rate in the ISM should principally be determined by the kinetics with the
bonding configuration playing a secondary role.
Furthermore, in the case of generating both the OH and NH radicals, no mention is made of the rate at
which the OH and NH bonds, while the species are still bonded into the dust, is photolyzed by FUV
photons.
>>> As to the photolytic lifetime, this has now been estimated and it would seem that once formed O,
OH, N or NH triatomic ring sites will indeed be photolysed but on a time-scale about an order of
magnitude longer than for the gas phase radicals in the diffuse ISM.
Is it really clear that a FUV photon so preferentially releases “XH” from the grains that the in situ
destruction of the XH bond does not even need to be mentioned?
>>> The photolysis of OH and NH in epoxide and aziridine surface groups is now discussed in detail and
given experimental and mechanistic justification. It should be noted that these triatomic ring sites are
highly-strained, “spring-loaded” in fact, and unstable to UV photons. In the ISM, as is now argued, it is
indeed likely that the photo-physics of such groups in nano-particles will indeed yield the diatomic
radicals predicted here.
Similarly the assumption that the sticking coefficient for O or N is about unity no matter where it actually
strikes a carbonaceous grain appears to be pure fantasy and I would suspect that such coefficients
would be orders of magnitude smaller.
>>> For large grains in the ISM, i.e., bulk material surfaces, at the low temperatures a sticking
coefficient of unity is generally assumed. However, it is true that this may not necessarily be the case
for nano-particles and it would seem to be more appropriate to use the results of molecular dynamics
calculations. However, I could not find any applicable experimental or simulation results. So, it looks like
there is a great project for someone here.
Nevertheless, I tend to agree with the referee that an assumed value of unity for the sticking coefficients
for atoms on nano-particles could be an overestimate.
However, for low-density, open, nano-particle structures only 10 or so atoms across (for a total number
of atoms of the order of several 100’s to 1000’s) it would seem that trapping might perhaps be a better
description than sticking but once again I could find no supporting evidence.
A cautionary footnote on this large uncertainty has now been added and mention is made that there
does not appear to be any relevant bibliography on this key subject.
Given just the two assumptions discussed above, the author’s observation that the model predictions of
the OH abundances in the low density ISM appear to coincide with observations given in the middle of
page 7 appears to be an amazing coincidence.
>>> Coincidences do happen!
While the reactions illustrated in Figures 3 & 4 could occur, I see no evidence in the manuscript to
support the assertion that these routes would be a preferred (or even likely) outcome of the reaction. In
fact, if I read the symbols correctly, the fragments are bound into the larger structure, hindering release
of the fragment in reaction 3 and hindering the formation of the CNC bond set in Figure 4 due to the
strain associated with pinning the reactants into the initial configuration in the larger grain. Again, I am
not arguing that such reactions do not occur, merely that no evidence is presented to support the wish
of the author that they do occur.
>>> Clearly, the reactions are not yet well-determined, nor are the possible reactions outcomes
(branching ratios) known.
In Fig. 3 the double-dotted bonded “fragments” on the right are indeed assumed to remain a part of the
nano-particle structure. A sentence has now been added to the caption of Fig. 1 to make clear the
meaning of the double-dotted binds in the first four figures.
The erosion scheme shown in Fig. 3 is now indicated as postulated in the text and speculative in the
figure caption. Hopefully, this perhaps justifies its inclusion in the wish-list of reactions.
The energetics of the reactions in Fig. 3 are now discussed within the framework that they are
destructive and therefore likely only occur in UV excited regions of the ISM.
The energetics for N incorporation into five-fold rings, as indicated in Fig. 4, do appear favourable and so
this is now stated in the text.
In the discussion of the presence of long alkyl side groups in the model population of the asphaltenes
hemoglobin and chlorophyll. However, the first thing to occur to me was the question, “Why aren’t any
long side groups photolyzed and lost in the ISM?” While the large scale structure of the framework dust
grain will preserve most carbon atoms bound within from loss by single FUV photons, this is not true of
side chains (as opposed to linkages). Cutting any CC bond in a side chain will result in the loss of all
carbon atoms not directly connected to the grain structure. For this reason, it would seem to this reader
that long residence in the ISM should eliminate such side chains from the dust grains.
>>> In the ISM the long aliphatic-olefinic chains probably exist as the bridging structures between
aromatic domains and are thus probably not present there as tails but rather as an integral part of a
larger contiguous structure. I have tried to make this discussion clearer in the revised version and, as
the referee suggests, discuss the likelihood that alkyl side groups are probably unstable in the ISM.
Finally, as probably 99% of the ISM’s silicate grain population either melts or vaporizes in the inner solar
system (compare the ISM grain size distribution to that in meteorite matrices) why should ISM grains
(whose mass is concentrated in very small grains) survive in protostellar nebulae? The small grains
would be easily oxidized and converted to CO. While I admire trying to apply the current work to all of
the chemical processes in the known universe, this is clearly a stretch too far. The probability that such
molecules were even remotely responsible for the evolution of biological systems seems vanishingly
small, especially if similar kerogens-like structures could be formed in the nebulae themselves.
>>> Some fraction of the small interstellar grains, nano-particles included, could and almost certainly
do survive the proto-solar nebula by virtue of their being incorporated into larger grains, rather than
existing as free-flying nano-particles. Indeed, the THEMIS model proposed that in the interstellar
medium nano-particles are transient species. Further, the shells of pre-solar organic nano-globules
(addressed in paper III) are granular and likely to contain some accreted interstellar nano-particles.
Thus, I would conjecture that nano-particles could play a role in the evolution towards eventual
biological systems and that the probability is far from vanishingly small and cannot be discounted.
Comments to the Author(s)
This paper highlights the potential importance of nanoparticles in
interstellar chemistry with a particular eye toward the formation of
precursors to biologically important molecules. The exploration of
potential pathways to formation in the context of a realistic dust
model, as well as the synthesis of a many-threaded narrative into a
coherent account of the role of nanoparticles, renders this paper, in
my opinion, worthy of publication.
>>> I wish to thank the referee for these encouraging remarks.
However, I regret that I cannot recommend publication as-is. While the
topic at hand is by nature somewhat speculative, this work often
offers plausible hypotheses without adequate quantitative
justification (e.g. the kangaroo's tail scenario). Further, this paper
suffers from inadequate referencing-- very little background is given
to place this work (and indeed this body of work) in context of the
existing literature.
>>> Yes, indeed this work is clearly rather speculative and that is perhaps why I may have missed the
mark with this short paper, which I was was trying to keep as short as possible for this reason.
However, it seems as though I was far too short and so I have added more detail and discussion. I have
now also tried to include all the supporting evidence and be more complete in my citation of the relevant
literature. Papers II and III in this series were, from the start, longer, much more detailed and are
comprehensively referenced.
Below, I summarize my major comments on the paper and then present a
few minor comments for consideration.
Major Comments
1. As can be gleaned from the abstract, this work has three principal
conclusions: A) nanoparticles may have a key role in OH production in
the ISM, B) asphaltenes moieties provide a means of understanding
aromatic carbonaceous grains, and C) nitrogen doping, even at low
levels, can have large impacts on the surface chemistry and
observational signatures of grains. I will address each of these
below:
>>> Indeed, these are the major themes of the work.
1A. While I felt the discussion of OH formation was quite good, it
seriously lacked context. For instance, what is the current thinking
on how OH is formed? Is the proposed mechanism solving a known
problem? Or is it suggesting formation rates via other pathways might
be overestimated?
>>> This is a very valid and pertinent remark. The proposed OH formation route has now been put into
context and the subject discussed in detail in connection with other work in this area. Indeed, given that
current ideas on OH formation rely on reactions with H2, the observation of abundant OH if diffuse
atomic clouds is problematic. This is now pointed out at the beginning of section 4(b).
1B. As indicated by the sentence "The asphaltene morphologies are
described and analyzed in more detail in the following paper in this
series," the asphaltene discussion feels incomplete. There is no
justification, aside from citations to other works (some unpublished)
that convincingly illustrates an association between asphaltenes and
carbonaceous interstellar grains. While such an association is
plausible, and it seems fine to speculate this is the case, this paper
likely provide a viable model for the structures present within
aromatic-rich interstellar carbonaceous grains." Perhaps better would
be "We comment on the structural similarities between asphaltenes and
biologically important molecules such as chlorophyll, and the
similarities between aromatic-rich moieties observed in terrestrial
asphaltenes and aromatic carbonaceous grains abundant in the
interstellar medium."
>>> This has now been modified along the lines suggested.
The last paragraph of Section 5 may be better
moved to Section 3 to make this connection clearer.
>>> After some careful thought it would appear to better to keep this at the end of Section 5. So, this
has not been changed but reference is now made to Section 5.
1C. It is claimed that nitrogen doping has "important and observable
consequences." Yet, I find no elucidation as to what these observable
signatures are nor comparisons to observations. Indeed, the
conclusions state that "the direct association of nitrogen with any
observable measure of dust in the low density ISM has yet to be made."
Aside from the proposed structures in Figures 4 and 5, substantive
discussion of the effects of nitrogen doping appear scant. Further,
energetics of the reactions illustrated in those figures does not
appear to be discussed.
>>> I thank the referee for picking up on this inconsistency. Indeed the aim was to say that nitrogen
doping COULD have important and observable consequences, which could be searched for with
specifically-designed observational tests. The wording in the abstract has been made more speculative.
Additional details of the effects of nitrogen doping and its possible observability in the ISM have been
added to Section 5 and the energetics of the reaction show in Fig. 4 should be favourable by about 0.8
eV, this is now mentioned.
2. In my comment 1 above, I highlighted several cases in which this
work is lacking in quantitative detail. Another critical such instance
is the discussion of the "kangaroo's tail" and the "jelly bowl." While
these analogies are clever and illustrative, they should be backed up
with quantification of the energetics-- are the proposed tails of
sufficient size to dissipate the energy associated with a typical UV
photon? Will the tail break off? Likewise the "long alkane chain"
discussed in the last paragraph of Section 5.
>>> This section has now been augmented and almost completely re-written. The ideas have now been
explored in more detail. However, it is difficult to be more quantitative because there appears to be
basically no experimental information on the energetics of these processes.
3. In my comment 1A above, I highlighted a lack of references to the
relevant literature. A more egregious example of this is the
introduction, which cites a mere two papers, both by the
author. Interstellar nanoparticles may not have received the attention
they have deserved, but they haven't been neglected completely! An
introduction placing this work in the context of the existing
literature is absolutely essential.
>>> The text and referencing have now been modified to better put this work within the appropriate
context of previous works of relevance to interstellar nano-particles.
As a result the introduction has been almost completely re-written as a proper introduction to the
subject.
Minor Comments
>>> These are now given for both O and N.
2. It may be worth mentioning AME as an astrophysical process
associated with nanoparticles.
>>> Thank you for pointing out this obviously-related aspect. This has now been included in the list in
the introduction.
3. Section 4b should make some mention of the typical bond strengths
of heavy elements.
>>> The typical bond energies are now given in Table 1.
4. The conclusions discuss N-doping as a possible explanation for
DIBs, yet this was not a focus of the present paper.
>>> Indeed, this is a major conclusion of paper II, which focusses on analysing the likely characteristics
of the DIB carriers. This remark has therefore be removed from the conclusions.
5. The last sentence of the paper regarding intelligence falls far
outside the scope of the work and should be deleted.
>>> This was not meant to be within the scope of the paper but was an attempt introduce a little bit of
humour through a double-meaning.
Obviously it didn’t work and so it has been removed.

author has greatly improved the manuscript by the addition of many more citations to
inal work and by more extended explanations for some of the terms and concepts used in this
nuscript. In addition, he has toned down his conclusions related to some of what I considered
e the most unreasonable extrapolations in the manuscript. While I still do not like the term
scence” and still believe that it is confusing, misleading and ill-conceived when used to refer
he activity of a surface, while there are many other perfectly acceptable terms that would
ve the same purpose, the author does make the case that it already exists in the literature (due
he very poor work of some previous referee!) and so I will no longer hold this solely against
author. It is simply a matter of (poor) taste. Much more documentation has gone into the
cussion of the reaction schemes proposed for the heavy atom reactions with the carbon
oparticles and this is also a great improvement. Given these great improvements I now
ommend publication of this manuscript.

nuscript as well as a few typos that he might wish to correct. These issues are not serious
ugh to require further review and the author’s (or editor’s) discretion in how these issues are
ressed is certainly sufficient as the more serious pertain to the final pages of the manuscript.

do not take into account that as the CH bonds form, fewer sites are available for subsequent
ctions. In chemistry, the balancing of these rates eventually leads to a steady state, but that
dy state can come from any number of combinations of factors. As an example, if the
ociation rate is << than the dissociation rate, then almost no CH bonds exist in the steady state
hey are destroyed immediately upon formation. However, if the association rate is >> than
dissociation rate, then almost all sites have been transformed into CH, and H can no longer

dy state might eventually be, but will not indicate a timescale for achieving equilibrium. In
case, the ratio indicates that hydrogenation will continue until somewhat more than half of
available sites are bonded to H, then will achieve a steady state.
page 15 (20-21 & 33 – 35) the author states “…from which the local conditions would down-
ct the most favourably-stable structures for that given environment. …and… given the same
rce materials of interstellar origin, the chemical and biological evolution leading to life
bably follows similar pathways in similar environments, leading to essentially the same
derlying "chemistry of life" everywhere.” This set of statements is internally inconsistent.
ile the statement makes sense down to “similar pathways in similar environments” the rest
y makes sense if one assumes that life elsewhere only exists in an earth-like environment,
uding the complete sequence of environmental changes experienced by our planet. Different
ironmental conditions would yield different pre-biotic chemical distributions and would
refore invalidate the concept of “…the same underlying "chemistry of life" everywhere.”
s same poor logic is also found in the last line of the manuscript (page 16. 20-22); “…then the
in of life will most likely follow the same chemical pathways and be rather similarly
structed everywhere in the Universe, wherever and whenever it arises.” Note that this
ement is akin to stating that “all planetary systems will resemble the solar system” which we
w to be completely incorrect.
other problem with this section is the concept that the prebiotic moieties “evolve” in some
cipation of the need that life will have. First, such molecules might survive (or even degrade
the various environmental changes that may have occurred on the Earth, but they do not
olve” in any real sense of that word. Second, living organisms synthesize both chlorophyll
hemoglobin internally; they do not extract these chemicals from the environment. While I
not state this as absolute fact, I do not believe that the extraction of such chemicals from the
ironment was ever part of early life’s metabolism. If that statement is true, then the existence
uch complex molecules in a prebiotic environment is an interesting coincidence but has
hing to do with either the origin or the evolution of life on earth or anywhere else.

other problem with this section is the concept that the prebiotic moieties “evolve” in some
icipation of the need that life will have. First, such molecules might survive (or even
rade in) the various environmental changes that may have occurred on the Earth, but they
not “evolve” in any real sense of that word. Second, living organisms synthesize both
orophyll and hemoglobin internally; they do not extract these chemicals from the
ironment. While I cannot state this as absolute fact, I do not believe that the extraction of
h chemicals from the environment was ever part of early life’s metabolism. If that
tement is true, then the existence of such complex molecules in a prebiotic environment is
interesting coincidence but has nothing to do with either the origin or the evolution of life
earth or anywhere else.
> The word and notion of evolution has been removed or reworded to make it clear that
is rather an inorganic chemical selectivity that I want to convey. However, I disagree that I
lied that living organisms would extract key molecules from the environment. My idea is
her that the existence of such species in the pre-biotic Earth would/could have influenced
key chemical processes that would eventually be adopted by living organisms, i.e., by
viding the bricks, windows, doors or tiles with which to build the house.

m happy to report that indeed this manuscript is much improved relative to the initial
sion and overall suitable for publication. I have but a few minor suggestions that I hope
uld be incorporated in the final manuscript.

n Section 3b, it is stated that "Increased internal energies (due to absorbed photons) will
n likely flip the floppy aliphatic/olefinic bridges into new structural states, a process that is
possible with the more rigid aromatic domains." While this is certainly plausible, effort
uld be made to compare quantitatively the relative energies of absorbed photons and the
uctural changes in the various geometries. It is unclear, for instance, how many orders of
gnitude separate the energy required to restructure an aromatic vs aliphatic domain.
> It is difficult to quantify these processes in great detail. However, I have added some
cussion of the energies and pathways involved that will hopefully make things a little
arer.
ir aromaticity in harshly irradiated environments. I would argue that that is far from the
y uncertainty inherent in such "bottom-up" approaches (and indeed the caveats raised in
very paper would agree); thus, this sentence should be modified, perhaps with a simple
r instance" or a brief listing of the principal unknowns such approaches must contend with.
> A few other unknowns have now been added in the new bulleted list in the introduction.
n the last paragraph of Section 4a, it is argued that "moderate extinction will likely tip the
ance in favour of hydrogenation." While the text leading up to that statement renders it
usible that this might be the case, the uncertainties are in my mind too great, and too little
tification is provided, to argue that this possibility is “likely.”
> Some new discussion on this point has been added.
