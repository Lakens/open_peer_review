An in silico prediction tool for the expansion culture of human skeletal muscle myoblasts
This manuscript by Yuki and colleagues describe a method to predict the expansion condition for
human skeletal muscle myoblasts (HSMM). This work was based on a myoblast culture model
with implementation of cell migration and differentiation process of the group’s previous 2-D
model. Even though this is an interesting study, with huge impact on cell-based therapy for
skeletal muscles. This reviewer feels that an important criterion was missing.
Major comment:
Authors assumed that the non-proliferative cell at t=48 h were differentiated cells. This reviewer
suggests to devise the model with different criteria. Since the model was based on the “basal
culture medium”, we can probably expect the proliferation and cell-cell contact dependent
inhibition. Authors assumed that that this “differentiated” cells just based on the proliferation.
For skeletal myoblasts in “real culture” takes several days or even few weeks in “confluent”
culture and additional stimulant such as horse serums are required. With out these valid
experimental data (i.e., confirmation with in vitro cell culture and performing immunostaining to
confirmed the differentiated cells”), this reviewer is very skeptic of defining the “differentiated
cells” and”proliferative cells”. Furthermore, authors do not account the fact that “differentiated”
SKMM tend to fuse to multinucleated cells. These predictive phenotypic changes should be
incorporated in order utilize this model to be useful in real culture platform.

This is a careful and innovating study, of great interest to all those working in the mass culture of
myoblasts for various types of cell therapy.
Considering this wide interest in the present study, our only objection is that the authors consider
only the application of myoblast transplantation in the cardiac tissue. However, an important line
of research on this subject, and in fact the first to appear, is the use of cultured myoblasts in the
treatment of diseases of the skeletal muscle, especially in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In this
regard, they should also mention this possibility (e.g. in line 42 of the Introduction), considering
that myoblast transplantation, indeed, was the only cell therapy that demonstrated to correct the
molecular defect in muscle fibers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients, as reported in the
most recent clinical trials, to which it could be added the potential formation of new muscle fibers
and of new satellite cells (see: PMID: 16691118, PMID: 17142039, PMID: 26076715). In these cases,
even higher amounts of myoblasts should be needed (generally to graft several muscles, and
probably in the order of >109), frequently in conditions of allo-transplantation. Indeed, in these
cases, the goal of the cell therapy is to restore a lost protein (as dystrophin in Duchenne muscular
dystrophy) or to restore the myofibers that were lost by a degenerative myopathy (see: PMID:
26076715), and not to secrete cytokines. In some cases, cell therapies with myoblasts were done in
autologous conditions in some muscular dystrophies (e.g. PMID: 23831596).
Otherwise, it is a very nice paper with an original approach of the topic.

Response to Reviewers
Response to Reviewer 1
We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. To respond to the reviewer’s comment, we separated the
comment into the three parts and responded to each of them.
Comment 1-1:
Authors assumed that the non-proliferative cell at t=48 h were differentiated cells. This reviewer
suggests to devise the model with different criteria. Since the model was based on the “basal culture
medium”, we can probably expect the proliferation and cell-cell contact dependent inhibition. Authors
assumed that that this “differentiated” cells just based on the proliferation.
Response 1-1:
We assumed that all non-proliferative cells at t = 48 h were “differentiated cells” in the simulations for
estimating the parameter value of the differentiation time tdif (see page 13 of the original manuscript).
As the reviewer pointed out, it is possible that a part of the non-proliferative cells enters quiescent state
due to cell-cell contact dependent inhibition. However, the assumption that all non-proliferative cells are
“differentiated cells” is considered to be reasonable because of the following reasons:
(i) According to the reference [15] of original manuscript (Kino-oka et al. 2009), an occupation ratio of
cells in a culture dish at t = 48 h was calculated as Xa * Ac = 1.1×10^3 [cells/cm^2] * 1.8×10^-5
[cm^2/cell] = 0.02. Therefore there were few cells surrounded by other cells at t = 48 h if the cells
were uniformly distributed.
(ii) Thus, even if we start simulations with the existence of cells in the quiescent state, these quiescent
cells will return to a non-quiescent proliferative state in the next time step (i.e. after Delta t = 0.1 h),
and the experimental condition of Rp = 0.84 will not be able to be maintained.
In the revised manuscript, the above discussion concerning the basis of this assumption was presented.
Comment 1-2:
For skeletal myoblasts in “real culture” takes several days or even few weeks in “confluent” culture and
additional stimulant such as horse serums are required. Without these valid experimental data (i.e.,
cells”), this reviewer is very skeptic of defining the “differentiated cells” and ”proliferative cells”.
Response 1-2:
In the original manuscript, we referred to the non-proliferative and non-quiescent cells, which have
rreversibly initiated but not completed their differentiation process, as “differentiated cells.” However,
as the reviewer suggested, readers may have an impression of “matured” multinucleated cells for the
“differentiated” cells. Thus, in the revised manuscript, we referred to these cells as “post-mitotic cells”
nstead.
Comment 1-3:
Furthermore, authors do not account the fact that “differentiated” SKMM tend to fuse to multinucleated
cells. These predictive phenotypic changes should be incorporated in order utilize this model to be useful
n real culture platform.
Response 1-3:
In the present paper, we focused on the modeling of the expansion process of single-nucleated SKMMs.
Although we understood that differentiated SKMMs will fuse to multinucleated cells, we did not mention
this process in the original manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we mentioned the fusion process to
make clear the target phenomenon of our model.

muscular dystrophies. We mentioned this possible application of cultured myoblasts in the revised
manuscript.
