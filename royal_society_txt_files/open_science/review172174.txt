In this study, Payne and colleagues tested the "thrifty phenotype" hypothesis for explaining
possible differences in upper limb proportions between high- and low-land Himalayan
population samples in Nepal. They found statistical support for this hypothesis in limb and ulnar
proportions in highland populations (being shorter than lowland populations). They found
conflicting evidence for cold adaptation as an explanation for such limb differences, especially in
the lack of population differences in hand proportions.
Overall, the study looks to be well-designed and properly conducted, and demonstrates new,
interesting evidence that the thrifty phenotype hypothesis could explain convergence of
differentiating limb proportions in highland populations of the Andes and Himalayas. I only
have minor suggestions, mainly for the discussion section, for clarification of some of the points
the authors raised as potential explanatory factors for presence/absences of certain limb
proportion characteristics between highland and lowland populations. The suggestions that I
would like the authors to address prior to publication are listed below according to the order by
which they occur in the manuscript:
P1L39: The formatting of citation numbers seems to be incorrect here. Please revise.
P2L9: What do the authors mean by "critical body elements"? All limb elements are critical in the
sense that they allow typical movements associated with human locomotion. Do the authors
mean hands and feet serve critical functions for certain tasks? Please clarify.
P3L48: How might age differences between the Andean sample (children) and the current
Himalayan sample (Age 18-59 years) influence interpretation of whether the two studies are
consistent with each other?
P3L56: I am not sure the lack of differences in hand proportions constitutes evidence FOR
selective protection (in other words, stabilizing selection). Couldn't a lack of selection be an
equally consistent explanation for the data in this case? Because evidence is not strong either way,
and there is no longitudinal data to demonstrate specific developmental pathways that could
indicate selection, I recommend removing this reference to "selective protection".

In “Thrifty Phenotype vs Cold Adaptation: Trade-offs in Upper Limb Proportions of Himalayan
Populations of Nepal”, the authors determined if upper limb proportions in Tibetans/Sherpas
were different between high versus low-altitude born adults. They found that total upper limb
and ulna lengths were significantly shorter in high-altitude born adults, but that hand length and
width did not differ significantly between the two groups. The authors then considered if their
findings supported cold adaptation or the thrifty phenotype hypothesis. They contend that their
results support a thrifty phenotype hypothesis and do not support cold adaptation. Overall, this
is a well-written and clearly communicated manuscript that contributes to our understanding of
the multi-stress environment of high altitude on human phenotypic plasticity. My minor
comments are below:
Minor Comments
1. It would be helpful in the “Study Sample” section of the methods to break up the sample size
reported (254) into the high and low-altitude groups. This is reported in the table, broken up by
male and female, but it would be helpful to have it reported in the text.
2. Likewise, given that the paper considers cold adaptation, it would be helpful to report data on
temperatures for both study sites. Possibly average minimum temperatures in winter.
3. Page 4, sentence beginning line 29: To me, this statement does not read as a sentence– consider
rephrasing.
4. The authors state that there are no sample size assumptions for t-tests therefore sample size
differences between groups should not impact the results. However, samples size can impact the
power of an analysis to detect a significant association even for t-tests. Perhaps the lack of
associations identified in the female sample is due to a lack of power. Is the female sample size
powered to detect differences between the two groups? A line or two addressing this in the
discussion should suffice to address this point.
5. A quick definition of the thrifty phenotype hypothesis in the introduction should be included.
Given this is the central finding of the paper, defining this idea would be useful. I recognize that
the authors include a statement on this with reference to skeletal elements on page 2 beginning
line 8, but it would also be helpful to define it more broadly.
6. Page 4 line 37: the authors address that shared genetic ancestry of the two populations could be
contributing to hand shape and be the reason for the lack of difference. Are there any data from
non-human organisms suggesting genetic-based long-term adaptations in limb morphology as
opposed to plasticity. This may not need to be added to the text, but if it does exist, it could
be interesting to include a statement and citation or two.

RODUCTION
he introduction, the references have now been cited correctly, as noted by reviewer 1
more substantial definition of the thrifty phenotype hypothesis has been outlined in the
oduction. As recommended by reviewer 2.
use of the word “critical” has also been removed when discussing the functions of autopod
sus zeugopod in the introduction, in order to clarify the implications of the thrifty phenotype
othesis, as recommended by reviewer 1.
THODS
the methods section, the sample size has been broken down into highland and lowland
ulations, as kindly suggested by reviewer 2. Average minimum winter temperatures have also
n added, as recommended by reviewer 2.
CUSSION
omment was made on the differences in age between the Andean sample referenced, and the
rent study sample, as suggested by reviewer 1.
noted by reviewer 2, the discussion of the applicability of cold adaptation theory did not make
se, and therefore this sentence has been clarified.
kindly suggested by reviewer 2, the use of the phrase “selective protection” was removed to
id assumptions relating to stabilising selection.
response to reviewer 2’s comment about genetic-based long-term adaptations in limb
rphology in non-humans, a brief review of the literature was carried out. This indicated that
re are genetic-based long-term adaptations in limb morphology in non-human animals,
ever, the research carried out relating to this tends towards the study of homeobox genes,
ting broadly to limb development, rather than nuances in limb morphology, as discussed in this
nuscript. In order to avoid detracting from the main discussion, the authors decided that it
uld not be required to mention homeobox genes here, particularly as this was deemed non-
ential by reviewer 2.
ote was made on the potential lack of power in the female sample, as recommended by reviewer
