Evaluation of the engineering properties of rock mass (damage index andintegrity coefficient)
isquite interesting topics in the scopes of rock mechanics and rock engineering. The field point
load test was considered as a cheap and useful testing method due to its ease of testing, simplicity
of specimen preparation, and widespread field application. In this manuscript, a new method
was proposed to evaluate the engineering properties of rock mass by discussing field point load
testing results. A set of tests and some statistical analyses have been carried out in this
manuscript, which can be provided some potential value for further researches or engineering
practices.The content of the paper does relay some interesting findings and therefore can be
published if the minor remarks are corrected.Some minor remarks for quality improvement of
this manuscript are shown as follows:
1. Page 1 Line 44-46: The sentence ‘Several researchers (Aydan O et al.,…) reported the scm/sc
versus’. What does mean the ‘scm/sc’,it represents‘the ratio’ or ‘scm or sc’?
2. Abbreviations should be used in uniformity, such in the Eq. 2 and Eq. 4. In the Eq. 2," PLS" can
be replaced by " Is". If want to agreed with the conventional usage, I suggest use " PLS" for the
point load strength in the Eq. 2.
3. A notation can be added after Table 3, to give the definitions for all variables and explain the
parameters L, W, H, I, J, HD and Wf, although these definitions have been appeared in the paper.
4. Different notations are listed in Table 3 and Table 4. In the Table 4, what does the ‘P’ present?
5. Page 9 Line 31-32: What does mean the Eq.8?
6. In the Table 7, the ‘Velocity’ should be replaced by ‘P-wave velocity’.

This paper considers a damage index of rock masses which is a crucial controlling parameter for
rock mass strength and deformation in civil, geological and
mining engineering projects. In this study, a method was proposed for computing the damage
index of a rock mass based on the field point load strength. This method considers a strength
ratio whose numerator is the point load strength (PLS) of
splitting along the pre-existing joint and whose denominator is the PLS of intact rock failure. To
validate this method, the authors derived a relationship between the damage index and the
integrality coefficient using an empirical relation. Moreover,
numerous experimental tests were conducted, including P-wave testing and on-site point load
testing. Finally, linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the correlation between the
new damage index R D and the integrality coefficient v K . The authors claim that they have
presented new method which is sensitive to both plasticity and damage in estimating the damage
degree of rock masses in underground excavation and tunnel engineering.
The claim that the model takes care of plasticity is unfounded.
It is not clear how the wave velocity which is the mass response reflected in the integrality index
has linear regression with the PLS ratio which is just surface response.
The authors should improve the m/s based upon the comments made on the paper.

Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article

effects), but otherwise both reviewers seem positive about the work and have suggested various
minor revisions. Please undertake minor revisions to address each of the reviewer suggestions
and concerns, and resubmit for the final decision.

List of Responses
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewer’s comments concerning our
manuscript entitle “A New Method for Evaluating the Rock Mass Damage Index
Based on the Field Point Load Strength” (ID: RSOS-181591). Those comments are
all valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as the
important guiding significance to our researches. We have studied comments
carefully and have made correction which we hope meet with approval. Revised or
added portion are marked in red in the paper. Many explanations are marked in the
form of annotations. The main corrections in the paper and the responds to the
reviewer’s comments are as following:
Reviewer: 1
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
1. Response to comment: Page 1 Line 44-46: The sentence ‘Several researchers
(Aydan O et al.,…) reported the scm/sc versus’. What does mean the ‘scm/sc’,it
represents‘the ratio’ or ‘scm or sc’?
Response: We are very sorry for our negligence of the detail. In this paper, the
‘scm/sc’ represents ‘the ratio.
2. Response to comment: Abbreviations should be used in uniformity, such in the
Eq. 2 and Eq. 4. In the Eq. 2," PLS" can be replaced by " Is". If want to agreed with
the conventional usage, I suggest use " PLS" for the point load strength in the Eq. 2.
Response: It is very sorry that we ignored the abbreviations uniformity. We have
corrected according with reviewer’s suggestion.
3. Response to comment: A notation can be added after Table 3, to give the
definitions for all variables and explain the parameters L, W, H, I, J, HD and Wf,
although these definitions have been appeared in the paper.
Response: It is very sorry that we ignored the notation after Table 3. A notation has
been added after Table 3, to give the definitions for all variables.
4. Response to comment: Different notations are listed in Table 3 and Table 4. In
the Table 4, what does the ‘P’ present?
Response: We are very sorry for the inconsistency between the letters in Table 3
and Table 4. In this regard, we have made a detailed inspection and correction.
5. Response to comment: Page 9 Line 31-32: What does mean the Eq.8?
Response: We are very sorry for the detail of the Eq.8 is ignored by us. We have
corrected the correctness of Eq.8.
6. Response to comment: In the Table 7, the ‘Velocity’ should be replaced by
‘P-wave velocity’.
Response: We are very sorry for the details are ignored by us. It has been corrected
in the Table 7.
Reviewer: 1
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
1. Response to comment: The claim that the model takes care of plasticity is
unfounded.
Response: Rock mass is a brittle material. When cracks exist in rock mass, the
plastic deformation of rock mass will be occurred under loading.
2. Response to comment: It is not clear how the wave velocity which is the mass
response reflected in the integrality index has linear regression with the PLS ratio
which is just surface response.
Response: The PLS ratio has relatively few studies. In the next study, the size,
density and closure of joint surface will be further studied and discussed.
