Corrections/suggestions:
- I am not sure whether it is the very first paper to explain the duality between real linear and
quaternion widely-linear/augmented processing, but a reference to Section IV of
J. Via, D. Ramirez, and I. Santamaria, “Properness and Widely Linear Processing of Quaternion
Random Vectors,” Information Theory, IEEE Transactions on, vol. 56, no. 7, pp. 3502–3515, 2010.
may be appropriate.
- In Section 4, the fact that the DWL-QLMS algorithm is just the familiar multivariate real LMS
algorithm (after absorbing the factor of 4 into alpha) should be mentioned. If I'm wrong about
this, a short comment about how they differ would be an interesting addition to the paper.
- Theorem 3.1 is stated for $\mu \in \mathbb{H}, \mu \neq 0$. However, the proof as far as I
can tell is only for mu=1,i,j,k. The simplest fix is to change the statement of the theorem to be less
general. A better fix would be to introduce the more general augmented quaternion Jacobian
matrix $J^a_{q^\mu}(f) = A J_q^r(f) (A^{-1})^\mu$, and use this to replace $J_q^a(h)$ and
$J_q^a(g)$ in Equation (3.3) (the proof still works with this more general notation because only
the rightmost A is affected).
- Since the main purpose of this addendum is to provide simplified proofs of the results in [3] by
exploiting the duality with real multivariate calculus, I think it's a pity that this duality trick isn't
fully exploited to further simplify the proof of Theorem 3.2.
The use of Lemma 3.1 and the portion of the proof between lines 12 and 27 on p. 5 can be avoided
by noting instead that if we define (X)_1 to be notation for the first row of the matrix X:
$(A)_1 G=(A)_1 g$
hence
$(G^a J^a_q(f))_1
= (A)_1 g J^r_q(f) A^{-1}
= (A)_1 J^r_q(f) g A^{-1}
= (A)_1 J^r_q(f) (A^{-1})^g g
= (J^a_{q^g}(f) g)_1$
Not only is this approach simpler, it also avoids using the line "the other results can be proved in
a similar manner", because all 4 results are obtained from this first row.
Furthermore, by starting with the more general $J^a_{q^\mu}(h)$ in Equation (3.13), you can
even extend the result to $\mu \in \mathbb{H}, \mu \neq 0$ instead of just mu=1,i,j,k, just as
with Theorem 3.1 (in this case only the first entry of the first row is needed in the end).
Since elegance/simplicity of proofs can be very much subjective, changing this proof is suggested
but not required.

The objective of the paper is clear: There is a new proof of the duality between the GHR calculus
and multivariate real calculus.
The paper is generally clear and easy to understand. So, in terms of the above context it is novel
though the style and derivations follow the authors previous papers.
Therefore, my comments are minor as follows, and am happy for this to be published as soon as
they amend the paper based on these suggestions.
1. in the Abstract line 45 add "the" before "cost functions"
2. page 2, line 10, the "aims" of this paper are . . . .
3. page 3, line 27: change "when seen functions of" to "with respect to" or something more
meaningful.
4. page 3, line 30,Definition 2.3, add comma after "then"
5. page 4, line 30, add comma after "then"
6. page 4, line 31, add : after "following chain rule"
7. page 4, line 40, remove "the" from "the both"
8. page 5, line 27, Theorem 3.2 second line: what is "then so too is" ?
9. page 6, line 31, change "The widely linear QLMS (WL-QLMS)" to "WL-QLMS". you already
defined this.

A New Proof of the Generalized HR Calculus
Manuscript ID: RSOS-160211
August 8, 2016
1 The Editors
Dear Dr. Andrew Dunn,
Thank you for your email of 03 Aug 2016, regarding the acceptance of our manuscript entitled “A New Proof
of the Generalized HR Calculus”, by D. Xu, H. Gao and D. P. Mandic, for publication in Royal Society Open
Science.
Following the comments of the Reviewers, we have performed the modi<U+FB01>cations as follows:
• The typos pointed out by the Reviewers have been carefully corrected,
• The suggestions mentioned by Reviewer 1 have been fully adopted and implemented, to make the results
in the revised manuscript more general,
• The Acknowledgments section has been rewritten in light of the contributions and suggestions of the
Reviewers.
We wish to thank you for your help throughout the process.
Yours sincerely,
Dongpo Xu, Hua Gao, and Danilo P. Mandic
Response to Reviewer 1
We wish to thank Reviewer 1 for a thorough reading of the manuscript and for his/her generous and expert advice,
such as regarding the general augmented quaternion Jacobian matrix and improved proof of the two theorems of
this manuscript.
Reviewer 1: I am not sure whether it is the very <U+FB01>rst paper to explain the duality between real linear and quater-
nion widely-linear/augmented processing, but a reference to Section IV of J. Via, D. Ramirez, and I. Santamaria,
Properness and Widely Linear Processing of Quaternion Random Vectors, Information Theory, IEEE Transactions
on, vol. 56, no. 7, pp. 3502–3515, 2010. may be appropriate.
Reply- Agreed. We have now cited this reference to re<U+FB02>ect the current state-of-the-art.
Reviewer 1: In Section 4, the fact that the D-WL-QLMS algorithm is just the familiar multivariate real LMS
algorithm (after absorbing the factor of 4 into alpha) should be mentioned. If I’m wrong about this, a short
comment about how they di<U+FB00>er would be an interesting addition to the paper.
Reply- Agreed. We have now added Remark 4.1 to highlight the advantages of the D-WL-QLMS algorithm and
to describe the di<U+FB00>erence between the D-WL-QLMS and real LMS (RLMS) algorithms.
Reviewer 1: Theorem 3.1 is stated for µ <U+2208> H, µ <U+0338>= 0. However, the proof as far as I can tell is only for mu=1,i,j,k.
The simplest <U+FB01>x is to change the statement of the theorem to be less general. A better <U+FB01>x would be to introduce
the more general augmented quaternion Jacobian matrix Jqaµ (f ) = AJqr (f )(A-1 )µ , and use this to replace Jqa (h)
and Jqa (g) in Equation (3.3) (the proof still works with this more general notation because only the rightmost A
is a<U+FB00>ected).
Reply- We appreciate this comment. We have now fully adopted the elegant solution provided by the Reviewer
and have included the improved proof of Theorem 3.1 in the revised manuscript.
Reviewer 1: - Since the main purpose of this addendum is to provide simpli<U+FB01>ed proofs of the results in [3] by
exploiting the duality with real multivariate calculus, I think it’s a pity that this duality trick isn’t fully exploited to
further simplify the proof of Theorem 3.2. The use of Lemma 3.1 and the portion of the proof between lines 12 and
27 on p. 5 can be avoided by noting instead that if we de<U+FB01>ne (X)1 to be notation for the <U+FB01>rst row of the matrix X:
(A)1 G = (A)1 g hence (Ga Jqa (f ))1 = (A)1 gJqr (f )A-1 = (A)1 Jqr (f )gA-1 = (A)1 Jqr (f )(A-1 )g g = (Jqag (f )g)1
Not only is this approach simpler, it also avoids using the line ”the other results can be proved in a similar
manner”, because all 4 results are obtained from this <U+FB01>rst row. Furthermore, by starting with the more general
Jqaµ (h) in Equation (3.13), you can even extend the result to µ <U+2208> H, µ <U+0338>= 0 instead of just mu=1,i,j,k, just as with
Theorem 3.1 (in this case only the <U+FB01>rst entry of the <U+FB01>rst row is needed in the end). Since elegance/simplicity of
proofs can be very much subjective, changing this proof is suggested but not required.
Reply- Agreed, we appreciate this suggestion and the deep insight of Reviewer 1 in <U+FB01>nding the simplest proof of
Theorem 3.2. We have revised the proof of Theorem 3.2 in full accordance with your suggestions.

and 53 p <U+2192> q
Reply- Agreed and corrected.
We wish to thank Reviewer 2 for his/her constructive comments and for improving the clarity of our manuscript.
Reviewer 2: This paper gives new proofs of the result the of the authors’ previous paper. However the advantage
of the new proofs is not clearly described. In particular application example does not reveal the advantage.
Reply- Agreed. We have now given a simpler proof of Theorem 3.2 according to the comments of Reviewer
1. After this modi<U+FB01>cation, the length of the two theorems is 1.5 page, which is more concise than the original
proof of 3 pages in the authors’ previous paper [3]. More importantly, the new proof reveals the intrinsic link
between the GHR calculus and multivariate real calculus. In addition, we have revised the last paragraph of the
Introduction section and have added Remark 4.1 to highlight the advantages of the new proofs.
Response to Reviewer 3
We wish to thank Reviewer 3 for his/her positive comments and for pointing out to grammatical errors in the
