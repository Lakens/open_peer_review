Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The authors make latex thin films doped with ATO to be spectrally selective.There is little
motivation provided about why there is a need for this type of thin film, doping windows with
different IR reflectors is well known, how is what is down here unique? The article has merit but
the authors need to complete a revision to address issues outlined below.
1) Where is the reflectance measurement? The authors show transmission but not reflection.
Ideally the particles will be reflecting but a transmission measurement doesn't indicate this.It is
highly doubtful that the ATO nanoparticles are good IR reflectors.
2) The film doesn't truly provide thermal insulation in the form of thermal conductivity, it
appears to only "block" the IR flux. Removing heat insulation from the title might be more
appropriate.
3) No flux distribution is provided for the lamp so it is not characteristic of true solar flux. How
will this affect the performance of the measurement?
4) No discussion is provided as to how well this film performs relative to other existing low e
coatings.

The manuscript submitted by Sheng et. al., deals with fabrication of coreshell structured 3-
methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS)-functionalized antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO)
nanoparticles (MANs)–poly(methyl methacrylate-co-butyl acrylate) (PMMA-co-BA, PMB) latex
nanocomposite particles via miniemulsion polymerization method. As it exhibits good
transmittance in the visible region, and excellent opacity in the near infrared region, the film
made from MANs/PMB nanocomposite appears potential candidate for heat insulation
applications. However, the following concerns need to be addressed before the manuscript is
being accepted for publication.
1) Can you modify the manuscript title without using short names?

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
The authors have comprehensively addressed the expert reviewer comments and the manuscript
is much improved. I am happy to recommend publication in RSOS.
pendix A
ommendation: Major revisions needed as noted.
mments: In this manuscript (ID: RSOS-170844), authors reported the “Synthesis of
Ns/poly(MMA-co-BA) hybrid latex nanocomposite by miniemulsion polymerization for
ical and heat insulation applications”. The content of the manuscript is interesting, but some
nts are not clearly explained and arranged. There are serious concerns with this manuscript.
comments are
The role of nanomaterials has not been identified, what is claimed at the end of the
introduction is generic and not supported by experimental evidence. The introduction does
not address the existing literature on core-shell MANs/poly(MMA-co-BA) hybrid latex
nanocomposite. The reasons why this combination is more advantage over those reported
poly(MMA–BA)/nano-ATO hybrid latex (see https://doi.org/10.1007/s11998-010-9318-6)
are not clearly addressed in the introduction part.
In section 3.1, the average particle size is found to be 70 nm. The histogram for overall
particle size distribution and DLS should provide.
a) Page 5, line 6, please change “glass” into “glass sheets”
b) Page 5, line 54, please change “DNS” into “DNS-86”
c) Page 7, line 32, please change “MANs/PMA” into “MANs/PMB”
Page 6, line 50, Author stated “dispersions in ethanol/water solution functionalized with MPS
(figure 3(a)) and without (figure 3(b))” but in figure 3 caption shows “MANs (a) and ATO
(b) in ethanol solution”. Please revise it.
Page 6, line 54, please provide experimental evidence or literature ref. to claim “nanosize
effect causes the reflecting light move to the shorter wavelength”
Page 7, Please explain the peak appeared at 1460 and 1174 cm-1 in figure 4 b, c. Figure 4 a
should discuss in text.
Compared with literature reported (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11998-010-9318-6) 87.5 nm size
of poly(MMA–BA)/nano-ATO hybrid latex, what is the advantage of the present
MANs/PMB hybrid latex particles?
More comments on Scheme and Figures: Must redraw scheme 1 and Figure 1. Scheme 1 and
figure 2 are fuzzy. Texts are not very clear and too small in both Scheme 1 and all Figures.
Figure 7 C seems like all three glasses are same. Please revise it.
Figure 2 d should provide without red circle and text. It’s hard to see the core-shell structure
of MANs/PMB. Please see ref. articles for good presentation (see
doi:10.1038/nprot.2012.141 Or DOI: 10.1002/ppsc.201300104)
The author should provide comparison data of MANs/PMB core-shell nanocomposite XPS
spectra and transmission data with PMMA-co-BA alone and literature results.
The lifetime of the present nanocomposite film on glass sheets should investigate to some
extent.
The performance comparison of the optical, heat and lifetime of present nanocomposite
should provide with literature reports. This information is important to demonstrate the
improvement of the present core-shell nanocomposite.
Uniform representation must need in this article. For example, In Page 2 Abstract, the author
stated, “latex nanocomposite particles”, but in table 1 heading “hybrid latex nanoparticles”
and in section 3.1 heading “nanocomposite latex particles”….
Figure 1, Author stated “the heat insulation measurement study using Infrared lamb”, but in
page 9, line 50, “under the iodine-tungsten light”. Please revise it.
Page 5, line 5, author stated “was used to measure the reflectance and transmittance spectra
………”. But in Results & discussion is discussed transmittance spectra only.
Page 9, Author should discuss Figure 5 A first followed by Figure B and C. Please revise it
accordingly.
Some repeated words are found in conclusion. Please revise it.
In conclusion, I think a major revision of this manuscript is needed before consideration for
publication.

eply to the Reviewer Comments
ank you very much for your careful review of the manuscript and useful comments and suggestions. We have
refully revised the manuscript accordingly. In the following, we summarize the changes made in response to each
mment.
eferee 1
omment 1: Where is the reflectance measurement? The authors show transmission but not reflection. Ideally the
rticles will be reflecting but a transmission measurement doesn't indicate this. It is highly doubtful that the ATO
noparticles are good IR reflectors.
eply: Usually, we measure how much IR is transmitted, knowing thatwe can determine how much IR is reflected
d absorbed.
omment 2: The film doesn't truly provide thermal insulation in the form of thermal conductivity, it appears to only
lock" the IR flux. Removing heat insulation from the title might be more appropriate.
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 1, Line 1).
omment 3: No flux distribution is provided for the lamp so it is not characteristic of true solar flux. How will this
fect the performance of the measurement?
eply: Compared with common glass sheet, the light transmittance of MANs/PMB-coated glasses in the whole
V-Vis-NIR range is decreased. With the increase of MANs content, the light shielding efficiency is increased. And
e wavelength range of the iodine-tungsten light is 340-2500nm. It indicates that the performance of this
easurement is reliable.
omment 4: No discussion is provided as to how well this film performs relative to other existing low e coatings.
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 1, Line 13-18).
eferee 2
omment 1: Can you modify the manuscript title without using short names?
eply: We have revised the title; however, expanding all abbreviations will make titles extralong. It’s common
actice for titles to have abbreviations in cases such as ours.
omment 2: Pl add latest literate on core-shell NPs by miniemulsion polymerization in the introduction part.
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 2, Line 26).
omment 3: The composition details need to be mentioned clearly in the section 2.3. “The oil phase of MMA, BA,
d MANs (10 (wt)%) and hexadecane as co-surfactant was stirred vigorously to allow”
eply: The composition details were given in Table 1. (See Page 4, Line 1).
omment 4: Add details about WMANS, WATO in equation 1.
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 6, Line 1).
omment 5: Add some more discussion on functionalization and core-shell structure formation, which will be
lpful to understand the structure formation.
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 3, Line 15-16).
omment 6: Rewrite the caption in Figure 7. It is not clear.
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 10, Line 25).
omment 7: Add more details about the insulation set up, IR lamp and its location. Any influence of volume of air on
mperature increase? What is the room temperature when the experiment was performed?
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 5, Line 21, Line23 and Figure 1.).
omment 8: Check for grammatical errors, and typos. E.g.
ne No. 32; The morphologies of synthesized MANs and MANs/PMB latex nanocomposite particles and were
died with transmission electron microscopy, which revealed particles.
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 1, Line 14).
ne No. 56; bicarbonate (NaHCO3) were…
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 3, Line3).
eferee 3
omment 1: The role of nanomaterials has not been identified, what is claimed at the end of the introduction is
neric and not supported by experimental evidence. The introduction does not address the existing literature on
re-shell MANs/poly (MMA-co-BA) hybrid latex nanocomposite. The reasons why this combination is more
vantage over those reported poly(MMA–BA)/nano-ATO hybrid latex (see
ps://doi.org/10.1007/s11998-010-9318-6) are not clearly addressed in the introduction part.
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 2, Line 31-32).
In section 3.1, the average particle size is found to be 70 nm. The histogram for overall particle size distribution
d DLS should provide.
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 6, Line 16).
omment 3
Page 5, line 6, please change “glass” into “glass sheets”
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 5, Line 15).
Page 5, line 54, please change “DNS” into “DNS-86”
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 6, Line 9).
Page 7, line 32, please change “MANs/PMA” into “MANs/PMB”
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 8, Line 1).
omment 4: Page 6, line 50, Author stated “dispersions in ethanol/water solution functionalized with MPS (figure
a)) and without (figure 3(b))” but in figure 3 caption shows “MANs (a) and ATO (b) in ethanol solution”. Please
vise it.
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 7, Line 23).
omment 5: Page 6, line 54, please provide experimental evidence or literature ref. to claim “nanosize effect causes
e reflecting light move to the shorter wavelength”
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 7, Line 19).
omment 6: Page 7, Please explain the peak appeared at 1460 and 1174 cm-1 in figure 4 b, c. Figure 4 a should
scuss in text.
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 8, Line 2-4).
omment 7: Compared with literature reported (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11998-010-9318-6) 87.5 nm size of
ly(MMA–BA)/nano-ATO hybrid latex, what is the advantage of the present MANs/PMB hybrid latex particles?
eply: Compared with literature reported (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11998-010-9318-6) 87.5 nm size of
ly(MMA–BA)/nano-ATO hybrid latex, the present MANs/PMB hybrid latex particles can be better tailored, and
ve regular morphology. This is included in the revised text (See Page 2, line 30-32)
omment 8: More comments on Scheme and Figures: Must redraw scheme 1 and Figure 1. Scheme 1 and figure 2
e fuzzy. Texts are not very clear and too small in both Scheme 1 and all Figures. Figure 7 C seems like all three
asses are same. Please revise it.
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 4 and Page 5).
omment 9: Figure 2 d should provide without red circle and text. It’s hard to see the core-shell structure of
ANs/PMB. Please see ref. articles for good presentation (see doi:10.1038/nprot.2012.141 Or DOI:
.1002/ppsc.201300104)
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 6, Figure 2).
) The author should provide comparison data of MANs/PMB core-shell nanocomposite XPS spectra and
nsmission data with PMMA-co-BA alone and literature results.
eply: Sorry, unfortunately we did not investigate transmission data with PMMA-co-BA alone. Relevant literature
formation is included in the manuscript revised (See Page 8, Line 22).
) The lifetime of the present nanocomposite film on glass sheets should investigate to some extent.
eply: Sorry, unfortunately we didn’t investigate the lifetime of the present nanocomosite film on glass sheets yet.
anks for your suggestion, we will pursue this in our subsequent studies.
) The performance comparison of the optical, heat and lifetime of present nanocomposite should provide with
erature reports. This information is important to demonstrate the improvement of the present core-shell
nocomposite.
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 10, Line 20-23).
) Uniform representation must need in this article. For example, In Page 2 Abstract, the author stated, “latex
nocomposite particles”, but in table 1 heading “hybrid latex nanoparticles” and in section 3.1 heading
anocomposite latex particles”….
eply: Suggested modification has been done in the revised manuscript (See Page 1, Line 2 &11; Page 3, Line 32;
ge 4, Line 1 ).
) Figure 1, Author stated “the heat insulation measurement study using Infrared lamb”, but in page 9, line 50,
