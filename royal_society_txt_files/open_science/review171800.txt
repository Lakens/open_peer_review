Good paper overall: I especially like the sketches at the end. I have a few technical or language
changes to recommend:
p. 2, line 35 and elsewhere: "late Pleistocene" should be thus: the subdivisions of epochs are
usually not capitalized.
p. 3, line 42: all of the "mammalians" cited are mammals, so simply call them that.
p. 4, line 15: change "eosuchian" to "eusuchian."
p. 5, line 10: delete "as in globidentans."
p. 5, lines 28-37: this is a run-on sentence. Also the usual appellation is "the Bahamas."
p. 6, line 37: place "only" before "postzygapophyses."
p. 7, line 8: "Airscribe" is a brand name. If it was another brand, refer to it as an "air abrasion toot"
p. 7, line 10: "Nikon" should be thus, not all caps.
p. 11, line 61: "crocodylian" should be thus.
p. 17, line 14: Drumheller and Brochu in Palaios v. 31 is from 2016, not 2014. I happen to know
this paper well, so I caught this. I have not gone through the other citations but I suggest double-
checking all of them.

This manuscript describes crocodile and tortoise remains from Aldabra Atoll. The croc material
is too fragmentary to reliably identify more precisely than Crocodylia (see below), but it comes
from larger animals than previously reported from the island. The tortoise material preserves
lesions consistent with perimortem bites from a crocodile, which illuminates some aspects of
predator-prey relationships in the late Pleistocene of Aldabra.

This is a good manuscript; I only have a few comments/thoughts:
1. As far as I know, epochs don’t have formal epochs; thus, the “late” in “late Pleistocene” should
not be capitalized.
2. I’m not sure we can refer this material more precisely than Crocodylia. An alligatorid is very
unlikely, but referrals should be based on the specimens and not reliant on biogeographic
arguments.
Although the material might be from an osteolaemine, we can rule out V. robustus. The dorsal
surface of the region of the skull represented by the fragment in Fig. 2c bears tuberosities in V.
robustus not apparent on this specimen.
3. Would it be possible to characterize the neurocentral sutures? They look closed in Fig. 2, but
would rather have this assessed by the authors who have seen the specimens first-hand.
4. Figure 3b seems to indicate a partial squamosal as well as the frontal-postorbital fragment
discussed in the text. Was such an object actually recovered? If so, can it be figured?
Additional minor comments:
p. 3, line 44/45 – Diplocynodon is not known from North America, so it is unlikely to have left
bite marks on anything there. (Diplocynodon has been reported in North American deposits, but
all such occurrences are referable to other taxa, usually Borealosuchus.)
p. 4, lines 10/11 and 17/18 – Allodaposuchus is not a member of Crocodylia; “crocodyliform”
would be better here.
p. 4, line 15/16 – “eosuchian” should be “eusuchian”
p. 4, line 30/31 – semicolon should be a comma
p. 6, line 42/43 – “as well as” should be “and”
p. 6, line 54/55 – “e.g.” would be more appropriate than “i.e.” in this context.
p. 8, line 23/24 – “encountered” is not needed in this sentence
p. 9, line 35/36 – “squamosal’s” should be “squamosals” or “squamosal”
p. 10, second line – sentence should end with a period rather than a question mark.
p. 11, bottom – “crocodilian” should be “crocodylian”
p. 12, line 42/43 – “to today’s” should be “from that of today”

Appendix A
“Trophic interactions between larger crocodylians and giant tortoises on Aldabra
Atoll, Western Indian Ocean, during the Late Pleistocene” by Scheyer and colleagues
explores feeding traces made by crocodylians on giant tortoises, a trophic dynamic
that would have been present in the recent past on Aldabra Atoll, but is no longer
occurring. This manuscript is well-researched and well-presented. I have a few
concerns about the terminology used in this study (outlined below), but the actual
conclusions presented are well-supported.
Suggested revisions:
Page 2, line 15 (and others): There are a few examples of words being used to
describe bite marks that, while relevant if using casual definitions, have very specific
meanings within the context of bite mark research. Binford’s 1981 classification
scheme, which is widely used in anthropology and is growing in usage in
paleontology, has very specific definitions for the terms pit, puncture, score, and
furrow. Pits and punctures form when a single tooth contacts the surface of the
bone, but does not mover laterally. Pits indent the bone surface while punctures
pierce it completely. Scores and furrows do represent lateral movement of the
marking tooth, with, similarly, scores indenting the bone surface and furrows
piercing it completely. In this paper, Binford’s classification scheme is not
referenced, so when these terms are used, it is unclear if those definitions are being
used, or if the more standard definitions (as casual descriptive terms) are in play.
The authors should strongly consider clarifying their word usage, by citing Binford’s
classifications and explaining whether they are using it.
BINFORD, L.R., 1981, Bones: Ancient Men and Modern Myths: Academic Press, New
York, 320 p.
Page 4, line 59 (and others): Another couple of words that need to be revisited for
clarity: gnawing and chewing. These words are used in the bite mark literature (and
functional morphology, etc.) to specifically describe grinding food processing which
relies on tooth occlusion. Thank mammal-style mechanical food processing. I
understand wanting to mix up the wording to avoid repetition, but crocs (with a few
very rare exceptions which probably exhibited herbivory) do not “chew” or “gnaw”
the same way mammals do. These two words need to be replaced with more general
terms, like biting.
Page 12, line 26: This description sounds like some of the behaviors described in the
Milan et al., 2010 paper cited by the authors, specifically the animals who didn’t
figure out “nutcracking” behavior while eating turtles and instead focused on
exposed limbs, etc. It would be worth mentioning and discussing this here.
Page 12, line 42: Are there serial marks (series marks formed when multiple teeth
contact the bone surface during a single biting event) which could be used to further
constrain the size and identity of the trace maker? If so, this would be valuable
information to add.
Page 12, line 50: May suggest scavenging? A little speculative, so the authors may or
may not want to go into it in this section.
Page 13, line 1: Is this in comparison to a single set of serial bite marks (multiple
tooth marks associated with a single biting event) or do the authors have multiple
sets of serial bite marks? If the latter, than this can also be used to address the
size/identity of the trace maker. See my comment from the previous page.
Page 13, line 18: Maybe state the authors' names for readability of the sentence?
Page 18, line 14: The first of the two cited Drumheller and Brochu papers
(“Phylogenetic taphonomy…”) is from 2016, not 2014.
Page 23, whole table: Does this journal allow supplemental material? This is a
monster of a table to actually insert into the text, but I do think that the data should
be shared.
Page 8, line 51: The authors mention that they do have vertebrae in the section
where they are discussing their crocodylian’s potential age. It would be very easy to
add a line about fusion of neurocentral sutures in those vertebrae and cite Brochu,
1996 to further support the interpretation that these animals were from sexually
mature individuals.

of the region of the skull represented by the fragment in Fig. 2c bears tuberosities in V. robustus not
apparent on this specimen.”
A COMMENT WAS ADDED TO P.6 AND P.7 ACCORDINGLY
“3. Would it be possible to characterize the neurocentral sutures? They look closed in Fig. 2, but would
rather have this assessed by the authors who have seen the specimens first-hand.”
THEY ARE INDEED CLOSED. A SENTENCE WAS ADDED ACCORDINGLY TO THE FIRST PART OF THE
RESULTS SECTION.
“4. Figure 3b seems to indicate a partial squamosal as well as the frontal-postorbital fragment discussed
in the text. Was such an object actually recovered? If so, can it be figured?”
THE FRONTO-POSTORBITAL FRAGMENT (SHOWN IN FIG. 3B AND IN FIG. 2C) IS FROM THE HOLOTYPE
AND THE OUTLINE IS SHOWN HERE ONLY FOR COMPARISON. WE HAVE NOW ADDED REFERENCE TO
THE ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION OF THE HOLOTYPE OF ALDABRACHAMPSUS BY BROCHU 2006 IN THE
FIGURE CAPTION FOR CLARIFICATION.
“p. 3, line 44/45 – Diplocynodon is not known from North America, so it is unlikely to have left bite
marks on anything there. (Diplocynodon has been reported in North American deposits, but all such
occurrences are referable to other taxa, usually Borealosuchus.)”
CHANGED
“p. 4, lines 10/11 and 17/18 – Allodaposuchus is not a member of Crocodylia; “crocodyliform” would be
better here.”
CHANGED
“p. 4, line 15/16 – “eosuchian” should be “eusuchian””
CHANGED
“p. 4, line 30/31 – semicolon should be a comma”
CHANGED
“p. 6, line 42/43 – “as well as” should be “and””
CHANGED
“p. 6, line 54/55 – “e.g.” would be more appropriate than “i.e.” in this context.”
CHANGED
“p. 8, line 23/24 – “encountered” is not needed in this sentence”
DELETED
“p. 9, line 35/36 – “squamosal’s” should be “squamosals” or “squamosal””
CHANGED
“p. 10, second line – sentence should end with a period rather than a question mark.”
CHANGED
“p. 11, bottom – “crocodilian” should be “crocodylian””
DONE
“p. 12, line 42/43 – “to today’s” should be “from that of today””
CHANGED
REPLY TO REVIEWER 3:
“Page 2, line 15 (and others): There are a few examples of words being used to describe bite marks
that, while relevant if using casual definitions, have very specific meanings within the context of bite
mark research. Binford’s 1981 classification scheme, which is widely used in anthropology and is
growing in usage in paleontology, has very specific definitions for the terms pit, puncture, score, and
furrow. Pits and punctures form when a single tooth contacts the surface of the bone, but does not
mover laterally. Pits indent the bone surface while punctures pierce it completely. Scores and furrows do
represent lateral movement of the marking tooth, with, similarly, scores indenting the bone surface and
furrows piercing it completely. In this paper, Binford’s classification scheme is not referenced, so when
these terms are used, it is unclear if those definitions are being used, or if the more standard definitions
(as casual descriptive terms) are in play. The authors should strongly consider clarifying their word
usage, by citing Binford’s classifications and explaining whether they are using it.
BINFORD, L.R., 1981, Bones: Ancient Men and Modern Myths: Academic Press, New York, 320 p.””
WE GLADLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE POINT AND HAVE ADDED INFORMATION FROM BINFORD’S
CLASSIFICATION SCHEME TO PAGE 4 OF THE MANSUCRIPT.
Page 4, line 59 (and others): Another couple of words that need to be revisited for clarity: gnawing and
chewing. These words are used in the bite mark literature (and functional morphology, etc.) to
specifically describe grinding food processing which relies on tooth occlusion. Thank mammal-style
mechanical food processing. I understand wanting to mix up the wording to avoid repetition, but crocs
(with a few very rare exceptions which probably exhibited herbivory) do not “chew” or “gnaw” the same
way mammals do. These two words need to be replaced with more general terms, like biting.
WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE POINT AND HAVE DELETED THE TERM “GNAWING” FROM THE TEXT. THE TERM
“CHEWING” WAS NOT USED BY US IN THE TEXT.
Page 12, line 26: This description sounds like some of the behaviors described in the Milan et al., 2010
paper cited by the authors, specifically the animals who didn’t figure out “nutcracking” behavior while
eating turtles and instead focused on exposed limbs, etc. It would be worth mentioning and discussing
this here.
WE ASSUME THAT THIS COMMENT RELATES TO PAGE 11, LINE 26 – YES, WE AGREE WITH THE
REVIEWER THAT IT IS SIMILAR TO THE MILAN ET AL. PAPER, HOWEVER, WE ALSO THINK THAT WE ARE
DEALING WITH A SPECIAL CASE WITH THESE GIANT TORTOISES, SO COMPARISON TO OTHER STUDIES
SHOULD BE DONE WITH CAUTION. THE SHEER SIZE OF SOME OF THE TORTOISES LIKELY PREVENTED
CROCODYLIANS FROM CRACKING THEM OPEN; EVEN IF THESE WOULD OTHERWISE SHOW SOME
“NUTCRACKING” BEHAVIOUR. WE NEVERTHELESS ADDED A SENTENCE IN THIS REGARD TO THE END
OF SECTION 4.2.
“Page 12, line 42: Are there serial marks (series marks formed when multiple teeth contact the bone
surface during a single biting event) which could be used to further constrain the size and identity of the
trace maker? If so, this would be valuable information to add.”
WE ASSUME THAT THIS COMMENT RELATES TO PAGE 11, LINE 42 – WE DISCUSS EQUIDISTANT
PUNCTURES AND PITS ON THE DORSAL SURFACE OF THE LARGER NUCHAL AS POTENTIALLY BEING
SERIAL MARKS OF ONE INDIVIDUAL, HOWEVER; WE DO NOT HAVE SKULL MATERIAL THAT WOULD
PROVIDE US MORE INFORMATION OF THE ALVEOLAR (AND THUS TEETH) DIMENSIONS. THEREFORE WE
LIKE TO REFRAIN FROM SPECULATING HERE.
“Page 12, line 50: May suggest scavenging? A little speculative, so the authors may or may not want to
go into it in this section.”
WE ASSUME THAT THIS COMMENT RELATES TO PAGE 11, LINE 50 – WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO REFRAIN
FROM ADDING SPECULATIVE TEXT HERE
“Page 13, line 1: Is this in comparison to a single set of serial bite marks (multiple tooth marks
associated with a single biting event) or do the authors have multiple sets of serial bite marks? If the
latter, than this can also be used to address the size/identity of the trace maker. See my comment from
the previous page.”
AS NOTED IN THE COMMENT ABOVE, GIVEN THE LIMITED MATERIAL WE’D LIKE TO REFRAIN FROM
SPECULATING FURTHER HERE
Page 13, line 18: Maybe state the authors' names for readability of the sentence?
THE AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS ARE GIVEN IN THE STYLE OF THE JOURNAL, THUS WE REFRAIN FROM
MAKING ANY CHANGES.
“Page 18, line 14: The first of the two cited Drumheller and Brochu papers (“Phylogenetic taphonomy…”)
is from 2016, not 2014.”
THANKS FOR SPOTTING THIS. SEE RESPONSE TO COMMENT BY REVIEWER 2 ABOVE.
“Page 23, whole table: Does this journal allow supplemental material? This is a monster of a table to
actually insert into the text, but I do think that the data should be shared.”
WE HAVE NOW SPLIT THE PREVIOUS TABLE IN TWO, ONE TABLE FOR THE TORTOISE REMAINS AND
THE OTHER FOR THE CROCODYLIAN REMAINS. THEREFORE IT SHOULD BE EASIER TO FIT THOSE IN
THE PAPER.
“Page 8, line 51: The authors mention that they do have vertebrae in the section where they are
discussing their crocodylian’s potential age. It would be very easy to add a line about fusion of
neurocentral sutures in those vertebrae and cite Brochu, 1996 to further support the interpretation that
these animals were from sexually mature individuals.
Brochu, C. A., 1996. Closure of neurocentral sutures during crocodilian ontogeny: implications for
maturity assessment in fossil archosaurs. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 16(1), 49-62.”
YES, WE CAN ADD THIS INFORMATION. A SENTENCE WAS ADDED ACCORDINGLY TO THE FIRST PART
OF THE RESULTS SECTION. SEE ALSO COMMENT BY REVIEWER 2.
“Page 4, line 15 (and others): Crocodyliform bite marks on turtle shell not cited in this paper, but worth
mentioning […]”
WE THANK THE REVIEWER FOR POINTING OUT ALL THESE ADDITIONAL REFERENCES. WE LIKE TO
REFRAIN FROM GIVING AN EXHAUSTIVE OVERVIEW, WHICH HAS BEEN DONE ALREADY ADMIRABLY BY
DRUMHELLER AND BROCHU 2016, IN OUR MANUSCRIPT. WE DO, HOWEVER, NOW INCLUDE A FEW
MORE REFERENCES WHICH SPECIFICALLY POINTED OUT A CHELONIVOROUS DIET IN CROCODYLIANS
(THE REFERENCES WERE ADDED ON P.5).
The final paragraph of page 5 is structured a little oddly. Consider lumping like predators with like?
WE HAVE TRIED TO ADDRESS THIS POINT AND THE PREVIOUS SUGGESTION BY REVIEWER 1, AND
HOPE THAT THE PARAGRAPH IS NOW EASIER TO UNDERSTAND. WE ALSO PREFER TO GROUP
RECORDED PREDATION EVENTS BY FOSSIL VS. MODERN RECORD RATHER THAN BY IDENTITY OF THE
PREDATORS.
Page 6, line 12: There is an open parenthesis missing here.
WE COULD NOT DETERMINE THE MENTIONED MISSING OPEN PARENTHESIS ON P.6
Page 11, line 47: There is a close parenthesis missing here.
