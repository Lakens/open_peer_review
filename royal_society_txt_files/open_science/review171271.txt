General Comments.
This manuscript examines the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) kinetics of 7,8-dihydroxy
coumarin and three, 4-substituted derivatives, and compares these with in silico docking studies
of the four compounds. The authors conclude that the lipophilicity of the 4-substituent is
positively associated with the COMT activity of the derivatives.
I have a number of concerns about this manuscript and I recommend major revisions. These
concerns are as follows.
1. The authors indicate that COMT catalyzes formation of the 8-OMe exclusively, yet I see no
clear evidence in the 1H and 13C NMR in the supplementary data or an explanation as to how
they came to this conclusion. This is a major oversight and would need to be addressed as the
premise of selective 8-OMe formation is central to their in silico experiments and conclusions.
2. 7,8-dihydroxycoumarins have comparable oxidation potentials to quercetin (Biochimie, 92(9)
1123-1129 (2010)), which is known to be unstable in basic aqueous media. Although the rate of
conversion of the coumarins is likely to be low in a 5 min pre-incubation, the authors should
report on any instability of the dihydroxycoumarins under these conditions.
3. It is not clear if the acetic acid group of 4-ADPN was assessed in the protonated or ionized
form in silico. This could have profound impact on the in silico results.
4. The authors conclude that the lipophilicity of the 4-substituent is responsible for the observed
kinetic parameters, yet do not utilize common lipophilicity parameters to support this argument.
Nor do they attempt to probe the electronic effects of the 4-substituents on Km, Cl or pKa to
further support their lipophilicity argument.

Overall, the manuscript was carefully prepared, and I would like to recommend this study. A
couple of minor concerns are listed as below,
1. I would like to suggest the author carry out some pharmacological assays for those metabolites
and comparison between original forms and metabolites should be involved to demonstrated that
metabolism could obstruct the pharmacological benefits.
2. The affinity between substrate and enzyme, along with the physiochemical properties play key
roles for the catalytic reaction. Methylation mediated by COMT should be a delectrophilic
reaction; consequently, the electronic cloud density of 8-OH also significantly affect the activation
4
energy. Hence, it is of importance to involve some discussions concerning reaction mechanism.
3. Regarding Ref. [12], the page number should be S211, in my opinion.

This manuscript examines the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) kinetics of 7,8-dihydroxy
coumarin and three, 4-substituted derivatives, and compares these with in silico docking studies of
the four compounds. The authors conclude that the lipophilicity of the 4-substituent is positively
associated with the COMT activity of the derivatives.
I have a number of concerns about this manuscript and I recommend major revisions. These
concerns are as follows.
1. The authors indicate that COMT catalyzes formation of the 8-OMe exclusively, yet I see no
clear evidence in the 1H and 13C NMR in the supplementary data or an explanation as to how they
came to this conclusion. This is a major oversight and would need to be addressed as the premise
of selective 8-OMe formation is central to their in silico experiments and conclusions.
Thank you for the valuable comments. To fully characterize the methylated metabolites of
7,8-DHCs, each of the 7-O-methylated products of daphnetin, 4-MDPN, 4-PDPN and 4-ADPN
were also chemically synthesized and fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR. By comparison of
the 1H NMR spectrums of the chem- and bio-synthesized mono-methyl products, C-8 hydroxyl
proton signal was observed between 9.38 and 9.55 ppm for the former, while C-7 hydroxyl proton
signal appeared between 10.33 and 10.49 ppm for the latter. Additionally, the chem-synthesized
7-O-methylated products displayed weak fluorescence emission, while the biotransformed
conjugates exhibited extremely strong fluorescence emission in TLC under 365 nm. With the help
of 7-O-methylated standards, the mono-methyl conjugates formed in the COMT-mediated
methylation system could be confirmed to be 8-O-methylated products. In the newly submitted
manuscript, the experimental procedure of the synthesis, the chemical shift, and the 1H and 13C
NMR spectrums of 7-O-methylated products have been added in the Supporting Information,
while the result section considering the metabolite characterization has also been revised.
2. 7,8-dihydroxycoumarins have comparable oxidation potentials to quercetin (Biochimie, 92(9)
1123-1129 (2010)), which is known to be unstable in basic aqueous media. Although the rate of
conversion of the coumarins is likely to be low in a 5 min pre-incubation, the authors should
report on any instability of the dihydroxycoumarins under these conditions.
According to your helpful suggestion, the stability of dihydroxycoumarins in Tris-HCl (pH7.4) has
been investigated. After 5 min of incubation with 10 µM dihydroxycoumarins, the remaining
dihydroxycoumarins was more than 98%, indicating that dihydroxycoumarins were relatively
stable under our incubation conditions.
3. It is not clear if the acetic acid group of 4-ADPN was assessed in the protonated or ionized form
in silico. This could have profound impact on the in silico results.
Thanks for the valuable comments. In ligand preparation, four 7,8-dihydroxycoumarins were
prepared in the treatment of ionization for pH 7.5. Herein, the anionic form of 4-ADPN was
assumed in the following docking simulation. The experimental section considering docking
simulation has also been revised.
4. The authors conclude that the lipophilicity of the 4-substituent is responsible for the observed
kinetic parameters, yet do not utilize common lipophilicity parameters to support this argument.
Nor do they attempt to probe the electronic effects of the 4-substituents on Km, Cl or pKa to further
support their lipophilicity argument.
Thanks for the valuable comments. According to your helpful suggestion, the electronic effect of
the 4-substituent on the pKa of the 7- and 8- hydroxyl groups of 7,8-dihydroxycoumarins has been
investigated. The pKa values of the 7- and 8-hydroxyl groups of 7,8-dihydroxycoumarins
determined using pKa estimation software (MarvinBeans pKa estimation plug-in, Ver. 15.6.29,
ChemAxon, Budapest, Hungary). The pKa values of 8-hydroxyl groups were 12.79, 12.77, 12.71
and 12.77 for daphnetin, 4-MDPN, 4-PDPN and 4-ADPN, respectively. The relatively lower pKa
value of 8-hydroxyl of 4-PDPN may partially explain the higher catalytic efficiency of this
compound compared with the other three, giving that deprotonation of the 8-hydroxyl is the first
step for methyl substitution (Mol Pharmacol 2001, 59: 393-402) and a decrease in pKa would
facilitate this step.
Introduction
Page 3, Line 21: I don’t understand the meaning of the sentence “As the existence of phenolic
hydroxyl groups, catechol coumarins should be the expected substrates of phase II metabolizing
enzymes.”
UGTs and SULTs generally have a preference for phenolic compounds, and these enzymes could
catalyze the transfer of a glucuronic acid group or a sulfonyl group to the nucleophilic hydroxyl
acceptor. And COMT could merely catalyze the substrates baring a catechol moiety by
transferring a methyl to one of the phenolic hydroxyls. Hence, the catechol motif of coumarins
may be the target site for the catalysis mediated by these phase II metabolizing enzymes such as
UGT, SULT and COMT.
Experimental
Page 6, Docking Simulation: No indication as to the ionization state of the compounds,

Thanks for the valuable comments. In ligand preparation, four 7,8-dihydroxycoumarins were
prepared in the treatment of ionization for pH 7.5. Herein, the anionic form of 4-ADPN was
assumed in the following docking simulation. The experimental section considering docking
simulation has also been revised.

Methylation profiles and metabolite characterization: Looking at the 1H and 13C NMR it is unclear
to me how the authors determined that the products were the 8-OMe and not the 7-OMe. Is
3.82ppm somehow diagnostic for 8-substitution?
Thank you for the valuable comments. To fully characterize the methylated metabolites of
7,8-DHCs, each of the 7-O-methylated products of daphnetin, 4-MDPN, 4-PDPN and 4-ADPN
were also chemically synthesized and fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR. By comparison of

while the result section considering the metabolite characterization has also been revised.

Fig. 4: Metal ions are not labeled in the figure or mentioned in the methods or the text of the

Thank you for this helpful suggestion. In the newly uploaded manuscript, metal ions are labeled in
figure 4 and the corresponding sentence in result section has been revised. The distance between
the 7-O or 8-O atom of 7,8-dihydroxycoumarins and Mg2+ was calculated, and the corresponding
values has been added in the result section considering docking simulation. According to the
results, the shorter distance between the 7-O as well as 8-O atom of 4-PDPN and Mg2+ indicated a
slightly more tightly coordinated to the metal comparing to the other three, which may account for
the relatively higher Clint of 4-PDPN.
Discussion
Page 10
Line 15: The authors suggest that due to “very few forms” of 4-ADPN showing the desired
octahedral coordination with Mg, this results in reduced catalytic efficiency. How do these
“forms” compare energetically with the other compounds?
According to your helpful comments, binding free energy calculations were conducted on the
basis of the best docked conformation of four compounds binding to COMT. Surprisingly, the
COMT-4-ADPN binding system demonstrated a lower binding free energy (<U+0394>Gbind) than the other
three. Considering the observation that only one of the 57 docked poses of 4-ADPN could form
the best docked conformation with the oxygen atoms in the catecholic hydroxyl group
coordinating to the Mg2+, it seems to be more difficult for 4-ADPN to form such desired
octahedral coordination required for the methyl-transfer reaction to occur, which may attribute to
the relatively lower catalytic efficiency of 4-ADPN.
Why is the metal binding data not reported in the results? This seems important if it is the major
justification for the observed Km and Cl.
This section has been revised according to this suggestion. Metal ions are labeled in figure 4 and
the corresponding sentence in result section has been revised. The distance between the 7-O or
8-O atom of 7,8-dihydroxycoumarins and Mg2+ was calculated, and the corresponding values has
been added in the result section considering docking simulation.
There is a linear relationship for distance between HO-8 and Me and Km of S-COMT (r squared
0.9989), but none for the other S-COMT parameters. This strikes me as important.
Considering the distance between the methyl carbon on SAM and the nearest oxygen on catechol,
it has been hypothesized that unusually short reactant distances may be a source of catalytic rate
enhancement (Am Chem Soc. 1998, 120(48): 12387-94). But direct relationship between Km value
and the distance between SAM and the catechol oxygen has not been reported yet. The Km value is
a comprehensive result jointly induced by several factors including both of the physiochemical
properties of substrate and the interactions between substrate and enzyme, and there may be a
need for more data in the form of Km values as well as the distance between SAM and the catechol
oxygen to generate any QSARs for these compounds.
What about the electronic effect of the 4-substituent on the pKa of the 7- and 8-OH groups?
Deprotonation of the 8-OH is the first step for Me substitution (See Ref 22, Mol Pharmacol
59:393-402 (2001)) and a decrease in pKa would facilitate this step.
Thanks for the valuable comments. According to your helpful suggestion, the electronic effect of
the 4-substituent on the pKa of the 7- and 8- hydroxyl groups of 7,8-dihydroxycoumarins has been
investigated. The pKa values of the 7- and 8-hydroxyl groups of 7,8-dihydroxycoumarins were
determined using pKa estimation software (MarvinBeans pKa estimation plug-in, Ver. 15.6.29,
ChemAxon, Budapest, Hungary). The pKa values of 8-hydroxyl groups were 12.79, 12.77, 12.71
and 12.77 for daphnetin, 4-MDPN, 4-PDPN and 4-ADPN, respectively. The relatively lower pKa
value of 8-hydroxyl of 4-PDPN may partially explain the higher catalytic efficiency of this
compound compared with the other three, giving that deprotonation of the 8-hydroxyl is the first
step for methyl substitution and a decrease in pKa would facilitate this step.
Line 37-40 (probe for assessment of COMT activities): Please clarify this statement. What steps
would need to be taken to account for interference from UGT and SULT pathways?
Thank you for the valuable comments. Actually, despite of being methylated by COMT,
7,8-dihydroxycoumarin could also undergo transformation mediated by UGT and SULT. Hence,
considering their ability of assessing COMT activity, this type of compounds could only be used
in cell or tissue preparations in vitro, by adding the cofactor of COMT-mediated methylation
(SAM). A series of 4-substituted 7,8-dihydroxycoumarins have been synthesized in our lab in the
aim of searching for ones which could only by metabolized by COMT. But no satisfying result has
been obtained yet, which may be attributed to the overlapping substrate specificities possessed by
these three enzymes for 7,8-dihydroxycoumarins .
Conclusion
Line 30-33 (lipophilicity of the C-4 substituents strongly affect the enzyme kinetics)
I disagree, lipophilicity does not explain the enzyme kinetics (not Km at least). Hansch-Fujita
constants show no relationship between the substituent lipophilicity and Km or Cl, electronic
effects may contribute (is the acetate ionized in the computational models?) but still does not fully
explain the data.
From the aspect of small molecules, the relatively lower pKa value of 8-hydroxyl of 4-PDPN may
partially explain the higher catalytic efficiency of this compound compared with the other three,
giving that deprotonation of the 8-hydroxyl is the first step for methyl substitution and a decrease
in pKa would facilitate this step. Additionally, taking the enzymatic environment into
consideration, a slightly more tight coordination of the 8-O atom of 4-PDPN to the metal center
indicated by the shorter distance between the 8-O atom of 4-PDPN and Mg2+ comparing to the
other three may also account for the relatively higher Clint of 4-PDPN.

couple of minor concerns are listed as below,
1. I would like to suggest the author carry out some pharmacological assays for those metabolites
and comparison between original forms and metabolites should be involved to demonstrated that
metabolism could obstruct the pharmacological benefits.
Thank you for the valuable comments. Actually, considering the antioxidant activity, DPPH
radical scavenging ability of 7,8-dihydroxycoumarins and their 8-O-methylated metabolites was
evaluated. Compared to 7,8-dihydroxycoumarins, their 8-O-methylated metabolites displayed ten
folds lower radical scavenging activity (data not shown). It is probably because the catechol
moiety can undergo a bi-electronic oxidation, which leads to the production of highly stable
quinonic structures (Biochim Biophys Acta. 2005, 1721(1-3): 174-84). Replacing the catechol
hydroxyl with methoxy has negative influence on the DPPH radical scavenging activity. However,
the effects of methylation on other pharmacological activities of 7,8-dihydroxycoumarins need to
be further investigated.
2. The affinity between substrate and enzyme, along with the physiochemical properties play key
roles for the catalytic reaction. Methylation mediated by COMT should be a delectrophilic
reaction; consequently, the electronic cloud density of 8-OH also significantly affect the activation
energy. Hence, it is of importance to involve some discussions concerning reaction mechanism.
Thanks for the valuable comments. The discussion section has been revised concerning the
mechanism of COMT-mediated methylation according to this helpful suggestion.
3. Regarding Ref. [12], the page number should be S211, in my opinion.
This error has been revised according to this helpful suggestion.
