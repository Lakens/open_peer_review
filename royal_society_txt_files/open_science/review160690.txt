The manuscript from Lymbery et al. deals with the context-dependent influence of a symbiotic
fly, on the carnivorous investment of the Cephalotus pitcher plant. It is well-written and straight
forward and focuses on a pitcher plant species of high interest, owing to its little-known ecology.
The fly is known to live in its larval stage in the pitcher fluid and feed on prey items and
decaying organic matter captured by the plant. The authors found that the fly’s larval density is
negatively correlated with the proportion of pitcher buds in plants bearing high proportion (and
not number as written in the abstract) of mature pitchers, but positively correlated with the
proportion of pitcher buds in plants bearing low proportion of mature pitchers. Thus they draw
the rapid conclusion that the fly provides a nutritional benefit and thereby behaves as mutualist
for the plant when food capture is high while it behaves like a parasite when food capture is
poor, owing to the reason that a poor or high investment in pitcher buds reflects nutrient
availability or nutrient stress, respectively. But they failed to show an effect of the fly larvae on
the nutrient status of the plant. Therefore they only show correlations and also use a double
shortcut to achieve their conclusion. I also have some concerns about the methods and the
statistical analysis. Therefore I suggest manuscript resubmission prompting the authors to
provide more convincing information with the collected data, to be more cautious with data
interpretation and to consider alternative hypotheses or alternative explanations of their results.
(1) Shortcuts about assessment of nutrient availability and investment in carnivory
(a) The authors take for granted that the relative allocation in pitcher buds reflects the nutrient
condition of the plant. The Givnish’s cost-benefit model predicts that carnivory can evolve only in
nutrient-stress habitats under no limitation of light and water. From this postulate, the authors,
once more postulate that a carnivorous plant should allocate more resources to carnivorous
structures under nutrient-limited conditions. But this second postulate is not evident and is not
always supported by existing literature on the subject. Several studies on different types of
carnivorous plants have shown that resource availability and investment in carnivory are
negatively correlated but there are also several studies that instead have shown a positive
correlation (e.g. Knight and Frost 1991 Ecology; Karlsson et al. 1991 Oecologia; Bazile et al. 2012,
PlosOne) or a negative correlation for some carnivorous traits and a positive correlation for other
carnivorous traits (Alcala and Dominguez 2005 Ecology). Moreover, to my point of view, while
the postulate of Givnish that a shortage of resources in the substrate should promote carnivory is
easy to accept, the postulate of the authors that a shortage of resources due to low prey-derived
nutrient assimilation should promote carnivory is not so obvious. Therefore, either direct
evidence has to be provided or at the very least this assumption should be nuanced in the light of
the existing literature showing opposed trends.
(b) The proportion of pitchers: a proxy of the amount of captured prey?
Why did the authors use the proportion of pitchers instead of the number of pitchers as an
estimate of the amount of captured prey? In a plant bearing two leaves, a photosynthetic leaf and
a pitcher, the proportion of pitchers is 50%, but there is only one pitcher, which potentially means
a low prey capture at the individual scale. Is there a link between the proportion of pitchers and
3
the number of pitchers and with the age/development stage of the plant? I advise the authors to
use the number instead of the proportion of pitchers as covariable in their model.
We don’t know whether the authors used the same plants for their experiment on C:N nutrient
status. But if it is the case, then the authors have got information on the plants’ nutrient status of
old pitchers. Therefore, to convince the reader that the proportion of adult pitchers is a good
estimate of the insect-derived nutrients of the plant, the authors should present a graph plotting
the proportions of adult pitchers against the mean C:N ratios of the plants. As I think that the
amount of insect-derived nutrients of the plant is better reflected by the number of pitchers than
by the proportion of pitchers, I advise the authors to perform their model using this variable. A
graph plotting the number of adult pitchers against the mean C:N signature of the plant would
also be welcome. Without this information, we cannot infer that the amount of prey captured is
reflected by the proportion of pitchers or number of pitchers.
(c) The measure of the proportion of pitcher buds (relative to pitcher buds + leaf buds) is not a
measure of the future allocation in carnivorous organs since buds may abort before developing
into pitchers, saving substantial resources that can be reallocated to photosynthesis. It would
have been far better to extend the observation time and measure the proportion of the fully
developed pitchers that have appeared following the experiment/measurements. Moreover we
need to know more biological information on the leaf/trap production in Cephalotus, is it by
flushes? Can we see a photograph showing the two types of leaves on the same individual? It is
thus necessary to show with more convincing data that investment in pitcher buds is determined
by prey-derived nutrient availability.
(2) No demonstration of an effect of the fly on the plant’s fitness or on its nutrient acquisition
To be able to draw a reliable conclusion on the nature (mutualism, commensalism, parasitism) of
the relationship between the plant and its infauna, it is ideally necessary to show an effect of the
symbiont on the plant’s (growth or reproductive) fitness. At least, the authors should show an
effect on its nutrient status (%N), on the quantity or proportion of N derived from prey or C:N
ratio since usually in carnivorous plants growing in open areas, N is limiting and not C (the
justification of the use of the C:N ratio can be better explained by the authors).
(a) A limited impact of the fly?
Cephalotus pitcher plants produce enzymes to digest prey. Their dependence on infauna for prey
digestion is maybe only limited. Moreover, the Basidis ambulans fly is not the sole symbiont of
Cephalotus, its contribution to the plant’s nutrition is maybe also limited. It would therefore be
necessary to disentangle the roles of prey and of larvae in the plant’s nutrition. But there are not
data on quantity of prey captured by the plant. In a number of pitcher plants, larval quantity is
correlated to prey quantity. Therefore the supposedly fly-derived nutrient benefit observed in
plants harboring high proportions of pitchers may merely only reflect a prey-derived nutrient
benefit, not observed in plants harboring fewer proportions of pitchers because the prey-derived
nutritional benefit for these plants was negligible. The variable prey density would have been
worthy to be added in the full model and the correlation between prey and larval densities
investigated.
(b) Other reasons for no evidence of their impact on the C:N ratio
- Maybe the authors did not find any effect of the larvae on the C:N ratio because the proportion
of nitrogen derived from insects is too small in Cephalotus follicularis, 26% as measured by
Schulze et al. 1997 Oecologia and this was probably overestimated since it was calculated for the
largest plants harboring high number of pitchers. Juvenile plants almost entirely depend on
nitrogen available in the soil.
- The hypothesis about the use of the C:N ratio as a proxy of prey-derived N-nutrient benefit is
that under constant conditions of inorganic nitrogen availability, an increased proportion of N
4
obtained from prey should relieve nitrogen limitation, which would be reflected by lower C : N
ratios in plants (Millet et al. 2003). This publication can be cited instead of the publication which
was cited (ref 34, l 136 which does not refer to C:N ratio). Can we consider that for the different
plants the soil nitrogen availability is constant?
- The use of C:N ratio is based on the fact that carbon uptake from prey is negligible. This seems
to be the case for most terrestrial plants (but not aquatic ones, see Adamec, 1997 The Botanical
Review). However there are some exceptions: some studies have documented the uptake of
carbon from prey in Drosera erythrorhiza, Nepenthes insignis or Dionaea muscipula (Dixon et
al., 1980 Australian Journal of Botany; Rischer et al., 2002 Phytochemistry; Kruse et al., 2014
Oecologia). Maybe there is a carbon uptake in Cephalotus too, explaining the poor efficiency of
this parameter as estimator of N-nutrient gain.
All these reasons can be raised in the discussion.
(3) Methods and statistical analysis
(a) I am not familiar with the type of models that has been performed and wonder whether it
would have been more appropriate to use more classical binomial GLMs with backward selection
of variables according to errors of type 3. In table 1, I do not understand why the first model
including the parameter ‘shading’, which has a lower AIC (despite more parameters) than the
third model including only ‘PP’, ‘density’ and their interaction was not kept. In other terms, I
would like to see the contribution of “shading” (and its degree of significance) to the variance of
pitcher buds.
(b) Moreover the test of the influence of this ‘shading’ variable, which is susceptible to have a
strong impact on the investment in carnivory in carnivorous plants, has not been justified in the
introduction and the way the degree of shade was calculated has not been explained in the
methods. The apparent absence of effect of this variable has not been discussed either.
(c) As regard figure 2, would it be possible to show a 3-D graph to better see the effect of the
proportion of adult pitchers?
(d) The larval densities were calculated at the plant scale not at the pitcher scale and the data
which are presented in the graph for the first question logically refer to different individuals. But
the C:N ratios were measured at the pitcher scale . One of the possible explanations for the
absence of an effect of the fly on this ratio is a weakness in the analysis. If there are several
measures per plant since there are several pitchers per plants, then a ‘plant’ effect should also be
tested and taken into account. We have no information on the number of replicates (pitchers)
used. As plants of different ages or development stages have been used, and as the age of the
plant (which might be linked to percentage of pitchers, this has to be tested) may influence this
ratio (see results by Schulze et al. 1997 Oecologia), a plant effect or a plant stage effect has to be
tested. We need to see a graph with the C:N ratios before and after the experiment for the treated
and control pitchers and also if necessary an age index of the plant (i.e. total leaf number
including photosynthetic leaves and traps).
(4) Other remarks
(a) A general remark in this manuscript concerns the lack of information on the collected data,
which makes the reviewing process a hard task. We need to know any correlation between
proportion of old pitchers and proportion of pitcher buds, between nutrient status of pitchers
before and after experiment, between proportion or number of old pitchers and nutrient status of
old pitchers, etc...
5
(b) There is also a global lack of information on the biology of the interacting species. Contrary to
what is said, B. ambulans is a common, not the main inquiline of Cephalotus follicularis (Yeates
1992 JNatHist). It is necessary to report observations on its feeding behavior, does it feed only on
decaying matter? Does it have a predatory behavior? Does it have itself a predator which lives
symbiotically with the pitcher plant? All this information is worthy of interest. Indeed, for
example, predators, by preying upon larvae before they emerge as adult, prevent nitrogen loss
for the plant and thus behave as mutualists (Ngai and Srivastiva 2006 Science).
(c) Last but not least, I do not agree with the authors when they say L197-199: “this is also the first
demonstration of any association between infauna and investment in carnivory by plants”. In
their study on Nepenthes bicalcarata, Bazile et al. (2012, PlosOne) investigated the relationship
between N. bicalcarata and the ant symbiont Camponotus schmitzi, top predator of the inquiline
community, and showed that not only this inquiline behaves as a nutrition mutualist for the
plant, but that, contrary to the main assumption of this article, it promotes the investment in
carnivory in this pitcher plant.

The manuscript centers around an interesting question: is it possible for an infaunal species
associated with a carnivorous plant to be both a parasite and a mutualistic partner, depending
upon environmental conditions? Overall, the manuscript is fairly well-written, and the authors
use appropriate statistical methodology for their data, and interpret their results correctly. The
problem with the work is that the results are inconclusive, and do not answer their research
question. They encountered a not-uncommon problem in field biology: the unforeseen
destruction of samples and consequent reduction in sample size. As a result, the power of their
statistical tests may have been insufficient to test their null hypotheses with the necessary degree
of confidence.
6
Crucially, no information is provided on the biology of the commensal species itself. Is it a
predator, a filter feeder, or something else? This basic background information is vital if one is to
interpret any results concerning the possible relationship between it and C. follicularis.
Specific comments/suggestions are as follows:
P3L61-64. You appear to be stating here that there is an effect of the larvae on the plant, and that
you are merely testing the magnitude of the effect.
P4L68. You did not examine nutrient content, which is concentration x dry mass.
P4L85-86. Do you have any data/observations to back up this assertion?
P6L114-128. Did you count larvae remaining in each pitcher at the end of the study? If not, it is
difficult to assess if the treatment was long-term (all larvae present at end) or ephemeral (few/no
larvae left). This information is necessary for full interpretation of any results.
P8L165-166. I'm not sure I understand this sentence. Do you mean that the data passed the tests
for homoscedasticity and normality of residuals, or that they didn't, but it wasn't a problem. If the
latter, why wasn't it a problem, if these conditions were required by the test?
P10L25. As you note, the results pertained to correlation rather than a causal relationship. As a
result, they can't help to answer the question of whether or not the larvae had an effect on the
physiology of the plant.
P11L244-246. I don't understand this statement. If you are analyzing for 15N, you use scout
samples to ascertain the required sample weight, and go from there. Any competent analytical
laboratory to whom you send samples will do this as a matter of course. The amount of carbon is
irrelevant in this case. If you are carrying out 13C analyses as well, different samples sizes will be
required. It just means that you will be using 2 samples (1 for each isotope of interest) instead of
one.

irrelevant in this case. If you are carrying out 13C analyses as well, different samples sizes will be
required. It just means that you will be using 2 samples (1 for each isotope of interest) instead of
one.

Review for Lymbery et al. (2016) „Context-dependent association between the density of
symbiotic fly larvae and carnivorous investment in the Albany pitcher plant”, submitted to Royal
Society Open Science.
First I have to state that, although my scientific work deals largely with carnivorous plants, I am
from a completely different biological community than the authors of this manuscript. I feel well
able to evaluate whether this study makes general sense and is of merit, but for the methods
applied I would recommend to ask experts if there are any questions/uncertainties.
12
I am very happy to see the understudied Cephalotus follicularis being the main subject in this
study, and to read that it is in a very interesting (and, for me, before unknown) relationship with
a fly and its larvae. The paper is well written and understandable throughout (I am not a native
English speaker). The experiments (as far as I can consider), results and discussion are very
interesting, comprehensive and comprehensible. Given the fact that little is known about
enigmatic Cephalotus, I am sure the paper has merit and will find readers from the ecological and
the general carnivorous plants community. I am happy to recommend acceptance with minor
revision for this manuscript, given the following (minor) points will be answered by the authors.
1) I have a general remark. During their study, the authors had access to many Cephalotus
pitchers and the trapped prey. I sincerely hope that the authors did not throw the pitcher content
away, but will present the prey spectrum in a future paper (which is highly anticipated by the
community). The prey of Cephalotus is, to my best knowledge, very little investigated, and it is
only known from very few snapshot analyses that ants are caught. Correct me if I am wrong. If
the authors are aware of any study, where the prey spectrum of Cephalotus is investigated, they
should cite it at the appropriate place in this manuscript.
2) L. 52: “As a result, every species of pitcher plant investigated to date has contained infauna [6-
16].” In my opinion, this is a too generalized statement – I believe that there are much more
studies available on pitcher plants, e.g. the exceptional Sarracenia psittacina (?), where no infauna
is reported from?
3) L. 67: “Cephalotus follicularis contains fewer infauna species than many other pitcher plants,
and by far the most common macroscopic inhabitants of the pitchers are the larvae of the
micropezid fly Badisis ambulans”. This statement requires reference.
4) L. 103: “Pitcher volume was calculated from measurements of height and width, assuming a
cylindrical shape.” Given the complex (inner) shape of the pitcher, this calculation appears to me
as too simplistic –has this method been employed anywhere else?
5) L. 110: “Shading may also be important, since light availability might influence the relative
payoff of investing in carnivorous vs photosynthetic leaves.” Does light also influence the
visitation by the fly, and by other animals?
6) L. 111: “Shading was estimated visually as the proportion of each plant which was covered by
surrounding vegetation when looking down from above. For consistency of estimates, the same
person (SJL) estimated shading for all plants.” This method appears to me (as far as I can
consider) as too simplistic. Why were not photos taken from each plant from above, and the
overlap quantified?
7) For evaluation whether the proportion of adult pitchers might increase as a function of plant
age, why not simply recording one plant from above during one growth period? There are
affordable outdoor time-lapse cameras available for this purpose.
8) L. 227: “This unexpected damage, however, provided an additional and intriguing result,
namely that larvae apparently enhance pitcher survival after damage.” Could the authors
provide a speculation on how this would work? I am expecting at least some ideas from the
authors.
9) L. 264: “…Bazile et al. [17] showed that the infaunal ant C. schmitzii r” For avoiding confusion,
the authors should add that this animal was found inside Nepenthes pitchers.

The manuscript of Limbery et al. has been significantly improved compared to its previous
version. I was sensitive to the attention paid by the authors to my comments. However, there are
still missing information concerning data analyses. Moreover several other points still require
some attention.
Title
- First, I prefer the previous title, which delivers a broader message than the current one
and because one cannot speak of an association between a ‘density’ of flies … but rather of a
correlation between the density of flies and the carnivorous investment in the pitcher plant.
Possibly consider this other proposition: “Context-dependence influence of a symbiotic fly on the
carnivorous investment of its pitcher plant”
Abstract
- P2L20 In the sentence I do not understand the “but” marking an opposition. There is not
opposition here because the infauna influences the allocation in the carnivorous structures using
the same pathway, i.e. also by affecting the nutrient availability to the plant. I suggest to instead
writing “Carnivorous plants allocate more resources to carnivorous structures under nutrient-
limited conditions. As the infauna which lives in association with these plants and feed on their
prey may influence the plant’s nutrient availability, we investigate …”
- Also better writing “Although the sign of the correlation between density of B. ambulans
larvae and relative investment in carnivorous and non-carnivorous structures depends on ….”
instead of “Although the association of B. ambulans larvae with relative investment in
carnivorous and non-carnivorous structures depends on ….”
Introduction
- P3L54, yes cite 17 as an example of how infauna affects prey assimilation positively but
do not cite 17 as an example of how infauna affects prey assimilation negatively : remove 17 in
[17,19]
14
- P3L59, there are several other alternative responses, publication 17 is cited as if it was an
exception and should be cited among others.
- “any examination of the effect of infauna on carnivorous investment should therefore be
coupled with an investigation of the nutrient status of the host” : The sentence should be changed
in “Therefore any investigation of the nature (mutualism or parasitism) of the plant-infauna
relationship should not be limited to an examination of the effect of the infauna on carnivorous
investment but should also be coupled with an examination of the nutrient status of the plant.”
- “Association between infauna and a) the relative number of new carnivorous
structures…: better put: “relationship between infauna density and a) the relative number of new
carnivorous structures…”
- P4L74 what do you mean by distribution?
Material and Methods
- P9 L188-189 Justify why measuring plant total N content and delta15N. If you think they
are of additional utility & information then please give their means before (when possible) and
after manipulation for treated plants and untreated plants in the result section (table 3 or
supplementary tables) as well as appropriate tests and parameter estimates.
Results
- My previous question concerning the first analysis was the following: In table 1, I do not
understand why the first model including the parameter ‘shading’, which has a lower AIC
(despite more parameters) than the third model including only ‘PP’, ‘density’ and their
interaction was not kept. In other terms, I would like to see the contribution of “shading” (and its
degree of significance) to the variance of proportion of pitcher buds.
The response of the authors was: On L126-L128 we explain why we retained the third,
rather than the first model from table 1, which is because all models within 2 AIC units of the top
model are considered to have equivalent explanatory power, and we follow Arnold (2010) in
selecting the most parsimonious model with the fewest parameters. Once the whole-model
selection process has been conducted objectively in this manner, parameter estimates for
variables that are not in the model cannot be derived.
I am sorry but this response does not satisfy me: to make the choice between the two models and
to judge if it is relevant to remove the variable ‘shading’, it is important to compare the
contribution of the different explanatory variables to the variance of the dependent variable in the
most complete model. The results of the tests are lacking for this model which had though the
lowest AIC. Therefore the reader cannot judge objectively whether the authors’ choice to remove
‘shading’ was relevant.
- P6L132-139. and supplementary table S1
I suggested testing the effect of plant age on the proportion of pitcher buds. This variable
is able to significantly influence the investment in carnivory as attested by the arising problem of
collinearity reported by the authors who, as I was expecting, found a correlation (which deserves
to be shown, sign and p-value) between plant age and proportion of adult pitchers (PP). I follow
the authors when they try to test the variable ‘age’ instead of the variable ‘PP’ (Supplementary
table 1) but I do not understand the authors when this time they decided to keep the variable
“shading” in all the models that have been compared. Does this means that ‘shading’ was this
time considered as a good predictor of the percentage of pitcher buds? Why not presenting the
analogous model (and AIC) to the one which was finally retained, i.e. the model including as
explanatory variables Age Density Age X Density ? To my point of view, there is some
incoherence in the method. Whatever the results of the analysis, it might equally be interesting to
show that the nature (mutualism or parasitism) of the plant-fly relationship changes with the age
of the plant.
- Moreover, regarding the whole analysis, a matrix of correlation of the different variables
(proportion of old pitchers, proportion of pitcher buds, age, shading, density; C:N) would
15
provide far more information than all the supplementary tables, which concerns AIC-based
model comparisons and does not provide any parameter estimates. VIF presented in the main
manuscript are comparatively of limited informative value regarding collinearity. We need to
know not only the magnitude but also the sign of the correlations.
- As regards the analysis of C:N, in the different models tested as shown in table4, did you
try to test the model: treatment PP treatment X PP (idem for age instead of PP) ? In the
supplementary table S2, why not testing the model with age alone? Please provide parameter
estimates.
Discussion
- P11L236 “that had greater proportion of adult pitchers” instead of “many adult
pitchers”.
- P11L237 “if a causal relationship was” instead of “if a causal relationship were”
- P12L237 total prey biomass more relevant than total prey volume
- P12L260-262: YES!!! The prediction of Givnish concerned an increase in carnivory in
nutrient-poorer soils and not with a lower availability of insect-derived nutrients.
- P13L291-298 good!

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript from Lymbery et al. deals with the context-dependent influence of a symbiotic fly, on the
carnivorous investment of the Cephalotus pitcher plant. It is well-written and straight forward and focuses on
a pitcher plant species of high interest, owing to its little-known ecology.
• We appreciate the positive comments.
The fly is known to live in its larval stage in the pitcher fluid and feed on prey items and decaying organic
matter captured by the plant. The authors found that the fly’s larval density is negatively correlated with the
proportion of pitcher buds in plants bearing high proportion (and not number as written in the abstract) of
mature pitchers, but positively correlated with the proportion of pitcher buds in plants bearing low proportion
of mature pitchers. Thus they draw the rapid conclusion that the fly provides a nutritional benefit and thereby
behaves as mutualist for the plant when food capture is high while it behaves like a parasite when food
capture is poor, owing to the reason that a poor or high investment in pitcher buds reflects nutrient
availability or nutrient stress, respectively. But they failed to show an effect of the fly larvae on the nutrient
status of the plant. Therefore they only show correlations and also use a double shortcut to achieve their
conclusion. I also have some concerns about the methods and the statistical analysis. Therefore I suggest
manuscript resubmission prompting the authors to provide more convincing information with the collected
data, to be more cautious with data interpretation and to consider alternative hypotheses or alternative
explanations of their results.
• We conducted a mix of correlative observations and experimental manipulations to
tease apart the mutualist vs parasitic associations of the fly, but as the reviewer
points out the experimental nutrient status outcome was unfortunately inconclusive.
While we still consider the most likely explanation for a reduction in carnivorous
investment to be a reduction in nutrient stress, we recognise the correlational nature
of the investment results and have accordingly made our conclusions more cautious,
as well as suggesting other potential explanations, in an extensively re-written
discussion section (see L218-L227, L53-L73, L308-323, and further explanation of
changes in the responses below). The title has also been modified to reflect the
uncertainty around mutualistic or parasitic effects.
• We have amended the abstract, and the main text of the manuscript, so that we
consistently refer to proportion of mature pitchers, not number of mature pitchers.
(1) Shortcuts about assessment of nutrient availability and investment in carnivory
(a) The authors take for granted that the relative allocation in pitcher buds reflects the nutrient condition of
the plant. The Givnish’s cost-benefit model predicts that carnivory can evolve only in nutrient-stress habitats
under no limitation of light and water. From this postulate, the authors, once more postulate that a
carnivorous plant should allocate more resources to carnivorous structures under nutrient-limited conditions.
But this second postulate is not evident and is not always supported by existing literature on the subject.
Several studies on different types of carnivorous plants have shown that resource availability and investment
in carnivory are negatively correlated but there are also several studies that instead have shown a positive
correlation (e.g. Knight and Frost 1991 Ecology; Karlsson et al. 1991 Oecologia; Bazile et al. 2012,
PlosOne) or a negative correlation for some carnivorous traits and a positive correlation for other
carnivorous traits (Alcala and Dominguez 2005 Ecology). Moreover, to my point of view, while the postulate
of Givnish that a shortage of resources in the substrate should promote carnivory is easy to accept, the
postulate of the authors that a shortage of resources due to low prey-derived nutrient assimilation should
promote carnivory is not so obvious. Therefore, either direct evidence has to be provided or at the very least
this assumption should be nuanced in the light of the existing literature showing opposed trends.
• This is a good point and in our revised manuscript we have emphasised this point
more and called for further studies on the system to elucidate the nature of this
effect (in particular see L58-L61, and L258-L273). We are still of the opinon that
the most probable cause of an increase in carnivorous investment is an increase in
nutrient stress. Despite the fact that a reduction in prey-derived nutrients may
indicate a reduction in the efficiency of the carnivorous strategy, in the extrememly
poor soils of the Southwest Floristic Region, carnivorous plants such as C.
follicularis have very limited scope for alternative responses to changes in nutrient
availability. We recognize, however, the possibility of alternative directions in
responses, and have explored these in the sections indicated above. We have also
explained that these alternatives are part of what prompted us to include an
(unfortunately inconclusive) experimental manipulation in our study. See L58-L61,
and L258-L273.
b) The proportion of pitchers: a proxy of the amount of captured prey?
Why did the authors use the proportion of pitchers instead of the number of pitchers as an estimate of the
amount of captured prey? In a plant bearing two leaves, a photosynthetic leaf and a pitcher, the proportion of
pitchers is 50%, but there is only one pitcher, which potentially means a low prey capture at the individual
scale. Is there a link between the proportion of pitchers and the number of pitchers and with the
age/development stage of the plant? I advise the authors to use the number instead of the proportion of
pitchers as covariable in their model. We don’t know whether the authors used the same plants for their
experiment on C:N nutrient status. But if it is the case, then the authors have got information on the plants’
nutrient status of old pitchers. Therefore, to convince the reader that the proportion of adult pitchers is a
good estimate of the insect-derived nutrients of the plant, the authors should present a graph plotting the
proportions of adult pitchers against the mean C:N ratios of the plants. As I think that the amount of insect-
derived nutrients of the plant is better reflected by the number of pitchers than by the proportion of pitchers, I
advise the authors to perform their model using this variable. A graph plotting the number of adult pitchers
against the mean C:N signature of the plant would also be welcome. Without this information, we cannot infer
that the amount of prey captured is reflected by the proportion of pitchers or number of pitchers.
• The proportion of mature pitchers provides an estimate of carnivorous structures
(and potential prey capture rate) relative to some measure of plant size, while
number of pitchers does not. The example of a plant with one pitcher and one leaf is
a good way of illustrating why we did this. This hypothetical plant only has one
pitcher, but it has small total tissue mass and therefore lower prey ‘requirements’. If
instead we adopted the suggestion of using number of pitchers, this plant with one
pitcher and one leaf would be rated as having lower investment in adult carnivorous
structures than a plant with five pitchers but 50 leaves, for example. In the main
manuscript, we have retained proportion of pitchers and explained in more detail
why we have taken this approach (L106-L114).
• Plotting proportion pitchers against C/N and number of pitchers against C/N did not
clearly distinguish between the two approaches. See below:
(c) The measure of the proportion of pitcher buds (relative to pitcher buds + leaf buds) is not a measure of the
future allocation in carnivorous organs since buds may abort before developing into pitchers, saving
substantial resources that can be reallocated to photosynthesis. It would have been far better to extend the
observation time and measure the proportion of the fully developed pitchers that have appeared following the
experiment/measurements.
• While we agree that long term studies are desirable, in many cases (including this
one) they are not feasible. In our manuscript, we have also called for longer term
studies where possible (L253-L257).
Moreover we need to know more biological information on the leaf/trap production in Cephalotus, is it by
flushes? Can we see a photograph showing the two types of leaves on the same individual? It is thus
necessary to show with more convincing data that investment in pitcher buds is determined by prey-derived
nutrient availability.
• A photograph of the type requested has now been included in figure 1.
(2) No demonstration of an effect of the fly on the plant’s fitness or on its nutrient acquisition
To be able to draw a reliable conclusion on the nature (mutualism, commensalism, parasitism) of the
relationship between the plant and its infauna, it is ideally necessary to show an effect of the symbiont on the
plant’s (growth or reproductive) fitness. At least, the authors should show an effect on its nutrient status
(%N), on the quantity or proportion of N derived from prey or C:N ratio since usually in carnivorous plants
growing in open areas, N is limiting and not C (the justification of the use of the C:N ratio can be better
explained by the authors).
• In the original manuscript we pointed out ourselves that we found no effect of larval
presence on C/N change in plants, and discussed possible reasons why this might be
the case. In particular, we have noted the loss of power due to destruction of some
experimental plants (L278-L282). We have also included additional analyses for
total N content and d15N in the Supplementary Material.
(a) A limited impact of the fly?
Cephalotus pitcher plants produce enzymes to digest prey. Their dependence on infauna for prey digestion is
maybe only limited. Moreover, the Basidis ambulans fly is not the sole symbiont of Cephalotus, its
contribution to the plant’s nutrition is maybe also limited. It would therefore be necessary to disentangle the
roles of prey and of larvae in the plant’s nutrition. But there are not data on quantity of prey captured by the
plant. In a number of pitcher plants, larval quantity is correlated to prey quantity. Therefore the supposedly
fly-derived nutrient benefit observed in plants harboring high proportions of pitchers may merely only reflect
a prey-derived nutrient benefit, not observed in plants harboring fewer proportions of pitchers because the
prey-derived nutritional benefit for these plants was negligible. The variable prey density would have been
worthy to be added in the full model and the correlation between prey and larval densities investigated.
• Unfortunately, at the time of the experiment the mass of prey was not recorded. We
have now discussed this point on L270-L273. We have also mentioned the lack of
published information on the way B. ambulans interacts with other possible infauna
species (L71-L74, L317-L323).
(b) Other reasons for no evidence of their impact on the C:N ratio
- Maybe the authors did not find any effect of the larvae on the C:N ratio because the proportion of nitrogen
derived from insects is too small in Cephalotus follicularis, 26% as measured by Schulze et al. 1997
Oecologia and this was probably overestimated since it was calculated for the largest plants harboring high
number of pitchers. Juvenile plants almost entirely depend on nitrogen available in the soil.
• This point is now discussed in the manuscript, beginning L308-L310.
- The hypothesis about the use of the C:N ratio as a proxy of prey-derived N-nutrient benefit is that under
constant conditions of inorganic nitrogen availability, an increased proportion of N obtained from prey
should relieve nitrogen limitation, which would be reflected by lower C : N ratios in plants (Millet et al.
2003). This publication can be cited instead of the publication which was cited (ref 34, l 136 which does not
refer to C:N ratio).
• We have also cited Grechi et al. (2007) and Baird and Middleton (2004), both of
which refer to C/N (L167, L168).
Can we consider that for the different plants the soil nitrogen availability is constant?
- The use of C:N ratio is based on the fact that carbon uptake from prey is negligible. This seems to be the
case for most terrestrial plants (but not aquatic ones, see Adamec, 1997 The Botanical Review). However
there are some exceptions: some studies have documented the uptake of carbon from prey in Drosera
erythrorhiza, Nepenthes insignis or Dionaea muscipula (Dixon et al., 1980 Australian Journal of Botany;
Rischer et al., 2002 Phytochemistry; Kruse et al., 2014 Oecologia). Maybe there is a carbon uptake in
Cephalotus too, explaining the poor efficiency of this parameter as estimator of N-nutrient gain. All these
reasons can be raised in the discussion.
• We have now added an extended discussion on possible uptake of C as well as
mineral nutrients (beginning L310-L317).
(3) Methods and statistical analysis
(a) I am not familiar with the type of models that has been performed and wonder whether it would have been
more appropriate to use more classical binomial GLMs with backward selection of variables according to
errors of type 3. In table 1, I do not understand why the first model including the parameter ‘shading’, which
has a lower AIC (despite more parameters) than the third model including only ‘PP’, ‘density’ and their
interaction was not kept. In other terms, I would like to see the contribution of “shading” (and its degree of
significance) to the variance of pitcher buds.
• Model comparison and simplification using AIC is now a standard approach for
GLM models (Arnold 2010), and relies on the likelihood of different models being a
better fit to the data. On L126-L128 we explain why we retained the third, rather
than the first model from table 1, which is because all models within 2 AIC units of
the top model are considered to have equivalent explanatory power, and we follow
Arnold (2010) in selecting the most parsimonious model with the fewest
parameters. Once the whole-model selection process has been conducted objectively
in this manner, parameter estimates for variables that are not in the model cannot be
derived.
(b) Moreover the test of the influence of this ‘shading’ variable, which is susceptible to have a strong impact
on the investment in carnivory in carnivorous plants, has not been justified in the introduction and the way
the degree of shade was calculated has not been explained in the methods. The apparent absence of effect of
this variable has not been discussed either.
• We have now also justified why and how shading was measured and included in the
full model (L110-L114).
(c) As regard figure 2, would it be possible to show a 3-D graph to better see the effect of the proportion of
adult pitchers?
• We sought opinion from colleagues on the ease of interpretation of 3D vs 2D
graphs, and the latter appeared much clearer and easier to interpret, so this has been
retained.
(d) The larval densities were calculated at the plant scale not at the pitcher scale and the data which are
presented in the graph for the first question logically refer to different individuals. But the C:N ratios were
measured at the pitcher scale. One of the possible explanations for the absence of an effect of the fly on this
ratio is a weakness in the analysis. If there are several measures per plant since there are several pitchers per
plants, then a ‘plant’ effect should also be tested and taken into account.
• Unfortunately, the lack of multiple measures per plant was dictated by our limited
budget. A “plant” effect in this case would be an individual level random effect,
since we had only one measure of C/N per plant (i.e. “plant” would not be a
blocking factor). In the investment analyses, all measures are at the plant scale (the
response variable is proportion of pitcher buds, a plant-level characteristic).
We have no information on the number of replicates (pitchers) used. As plants of different ages or
development stages have been used, and as the age of the plant (which might be linked to percentage of
pitchers, this has to be tested) may influence this ratio (see results by Schulze et al. 1997 Oecologia), a plant
effect or a plant stage effect has to be tested. We need to see a graph with the C:N ratios before and after the
experiment for the treated and control pitchers and also if necessary an age index of the plant (i.e. total leaf
number including photosynthetic leaves and traps).
• Total leaf number (as an indicator of age) has been added to the models of C/N
ratios in an alternative analyses presented as supplementary material (also referred
to in the main text, L136-L142). The addition of this variable had no effect, which is
to be expected since the allocation of plants to treatments was random. A graph of
C/N before and after experimental manipulation has also been included in the
supplementary material.
We need to know any correlation between proportion of old pitchers and proportion of pitcher buds, between
nutrient status of pitchers before and after experiment, between proportion or number of old pitchers and
nutrient status of old pitchers, etc...
• This is a good point and has been addressed by calculating Variance Inflation
Factors for predictor variables in all models, with VIF’s presented in the main
manuscript (L118-L121, L178-L181).
(b) There is also a global lack of information on the biology of the interacting species. Contrary to what is
said, B. ambulans is a common, not the main inquiline of Cephalotus follicularis (Yeates 1992 JNatHist). It is
necessary to report observations on its feeding behavior, does it feed only on decaying matter? Does it have a
predatory behavior? Does it have itself a predator which lives symbiotically with the pitcher plant? All this
information is worthy of interest. Indeed, for example, predators, by preying upon larvae before they emerge
as adult, prevent nitrogen loss for the plant and thus behave as mutualists (Ngai and Srivastiva 2006
Science).
• We have added some information on the feeding habits and behaviour of B.
ambulans (L69-L74). The principle reason for the dearth of information on the fly,
however, is that there are simply very few published studies available on it’s
biology and life history. Indeed, virtually all the currently published information on
B. ambulans comes from its original description by McAlpine, and a subsequent
study by Yeates. These have been cited. As is supported not only by Yeates (1992)
(and Yeates pers. comm.) but also our own observations, B. ambulans is
overwhelmingly the most common macroscopic inhabitant of pitchers. In all the
hundreds of pitchers we have observed, we have seen only a single individual of a
different insect species (also a fly larva, but of an unidentified species), and virtually
no other macroscopic inquillines. By contrast, almost all pitchers contain B.
ambulans (some have upwards of a dozen). This is the essence of our claim in the
manuscript. Nevertheless, we agree that any information on the interaction between
B. ambulans and other species would be valuable, and have called for such studies
in L337-L341. Intriguingly, we have ourselvels made a preliminary discovery of
such an effect (L227-L231 and L324-L337).
c) Last but not least, I do not agree with the authors when they say L197-199: “this is also the first
demonstration of any association between infauna and investment in carnivory by plants”. In their study on
Nepenthes bicalcarata, Bazile et al. (2012, PlosOne) investigated the relationship between N. bicalcarata and
the ant symbiont Camponotus schmitzi, top predator of the inquiline community, and showed that not only this
inquiline behaves as a nutrition mutualist for the plant, but that, contrary to the main assumption of this
article, it promotes the investment in carnivory in this pitcher plant.
• This statement has now been removed, and the findings of Bazile et al. 2012 have
been more extensively discussed.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript centers around an interesting question: is it possible for an infaunal species associated with a
carnivorous plant to be both a parasite and a mutualistic partner, depending upon environmental conditions?
Overall, the manuscript is fairly well-written, and the authors use appropriate statistical methodology for
their data, and interpret their results correctly.
• We appreciate the positive comments on the writing and the suitability of the
statistical approaches.
The problem with the work is that the results are inconclusive, and do not answer their research question.
They encountered a not-uncommon problem in field biology: the unforeseen destruction of samples and
consequent reduction in sample size. As a result, the power of their statistical tests may have been insufficient
to test their null hypotheses with the necessary degree of confidence.
• Several of our tests did identify statistically significant results, but unfortunately the
experimental findings for C/N were not conclusive. Although we cannot change this
outcome retrospectively, we have made greater efforts to appropriately qualify
conclusions given the correlative nature of the findings.
Crucially, no information is provided on the biology of the commensal species itself. Is it a predator, a filter
feeder, or something else? This basic background information is vital if one is to interpret any results
concerning the possible relationship between it and C. follicularis.
• This is a fair point, which was also raised by reviewer 1. We have now added extra
information on the feeding habits and behaviour of this species (L69-L74). Our
response to reviewer 1, above, provides a more detailed explanation of the additions
to the manuscript.
Specific comments/suggestions are as follows:
P3L61-64. You appear to be stating here that there is an effect of the larvae on the plant, and that you are
merely testing the magnitude of the effect.
• This sentence has now been adjusted to better reflect our approach (L62-L63).
P4L68. You did not examine nutrient content, which is concentration x dry mass.
• The term “nutrient content” has now been removed (L76).
P4L85-86. Do you have any data/observations to back up this assertion?
• This statement has now been adjusted to a more self-evident form: if the pitchers
were not present when the larvae arrived, the eggs could not have been laid in the
pitchers. We have also stated that new pitcher buds are less likely to have been
present when eggs were laid, rather than stating it as a definite fact. L93-L96.
P6L114-128. Did you count larvae remaining in each pitcher at the end of the study? If not, it is difficult to
assess if the treatment was long-term (all larvae present at end) or ephemeral (few/no larvae left). This
information is necessary for full interpretation of any results.
• This point has now been explored in the discussion (L287-L290).
P8L165-166. I'm not sure I understand this sentence. Do you mean that the data passed the tests for
homoscedasticity and normality of residuals, or that they didn't, but it wasn't a problem. If the latter, why
wasn't it a problem, if these conditions were required by the test?
• This sentence has been adjusted for clarity. Data passed both tests (L208-L212).
P10L25. As you note, the results pertained to correlation rather than a causal relationship. As a result, they
can't help to answer the question of whether or not the larvae had an effect on the physiology of the plant.
• The conclusions drawn from our study have now been moderated to more clearly
reflect this limitation (see L218-L224, L253-L257, L339-350, and further
explanation of changes in the responses above and to Reveiwer One).
P11L244-246. I don't understand this statement. If you are analyzing for 15N, you use scout samples to
ascertain the required sample weight, and go from there. Any competent analytical laboratory to whom you
send samples will do this as a matter of course. The amount of carbon is irrelevant in this case. If you are
carrying out 13C analyses as well, different samples sizes will be required. It just means that you will be
using 2 samples (1 for each isotope of interest) instead of one.
• Prior to experimental manipulation it was essential to avoid causing substantial
damage to the plant, so we could only take one very small sample per plant. Given
the very low N content in this plant species, the mass of tissue available was too
small for the mass spectrometer to analyse 15N in the pre-experiment samples. This
sentence has been removed from the manuscript because the 15N results have been
moved to the supplement.

Reviewer Comments and Author Responses
Reviewer 3
Comments to the Author(s)
Review for Lymbery et al. (2016) „Context-dependent association between the density of symbiotic fly larvae
and carnivorous investment in the Albany pitcher plant”, submitted to Royal Society Open Science.
First I have to state that, although my scientific work deals largely with carnivorous plants, I am from a
completely different biological community than the authors of this manuscript. I feel well able to evaluate
whether this study makes general sense and is of merit, but for the methods applied I would recommend to ask
experts if there are any questions/uncertainties.
I am very happy to see the understudied Cephalotus follicularis being the main subject in this study, and to
read that it is in a very interesting (and, for me, before unknown) relationship with a fly and its larvae. The
paper is well written and understandable throughout (I am not a native English speaker). The experiments (as
far as I can consider), results and discussion are very interesting, comprehensive and comprehensible. Given
the fact that little is known about enigmatic Cephalotus, I am sure the paper has merit and will find readers
from the ecological and the general carnivorous plants community. I am happy to recommend acceptance
with minor revision for this manuscript, given the following (minor) points will be answered by the authors.
• We sincerely thank the reviewer for their positive comments regarding the paper, and their
recommendation for its publication.
1) I have a general remark. During their study, the authors had access to many Cephalotus pitchers and the
trapped prey. I sincerely hope that the authors did not throw the pitcher content away, but will present the
prey spectrum in a future paper (which is highly anticipated by the community). The prey of Cephalotus is, to
my best knowledge, very little investigated, and it is only known from very few snapshot analyses that ants are
caught. Correct me if I am wrong. If the authors are aware of any study, where the prey spectrum of
Cephalotus is investigated, they should cite it at the appropriate place in this manuscript.
• We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. The contents of many of our sampled
pitchers are still in storage, and we will certainly consider an additional article regarding the
prey spectrum of C. follicularis. This, however, would not be straightforward, as the
contents of the pitchers as collected from the wild are often in an advanced state of decay
and it is sometimes not possible to distinguish even the quantity of insects captured.
2) L. 52: “As a result, every species of pitcher plant investigated to date has contained infauna [6-16].” In my
opinion, this is a too generalized statement – I believe that there are much more studies available on pitcher
plants, e.g. the exceptional Sarracenia psittacina (?), where no infauna is reported from?
• This statement has now been modified to remove the overgeneralisation.
3) L. 67: “Cephalotus follicularis contains fewer infauna species than many other pitcher plants, and by far
the most common macroscopic inhabitants of the pitchers are the larvae of the micropezid fly Badisis
ambulans”. This statement requires reference.
• We had referenced Yeates (1992) and have now also added Clarke (1985).
4) L. 103: “Pitcher volume was calculated from measurements of height and width, assuming a cylindrical
shape.” Given the complex (inner) shape of the pitcher, this calculation appears to me as too simplistic –has
this method been employed anywhere else?
• We agree that this method is a simplified estimate of volume, but believe that as long as all
pitchers were evaluated equally (i.e. the same method was applied to all pitchers) this
should not adversely influence the results. We do not have alternative measures of pitcher
volume for our studied pitchers available at this time.
5) L. 110: “Shading may also be important, since light availability might influence the relative payoff of
investing in carnivorous vs photosynthetic leaves.” Does light also influence the visitation by the fly, and by
other animals?
• This is an interesting idea, but at present there is no information (that we are aware of) on
the influence of shading on insect visitation to in C. follicularis. We have added a statement
to this effect at L112-113.
6) L. 111: “Shading was estimated visually as the proportion of each plant which was covered by surrounding
vegetation when looking down from above. For consistency of estimates, the same person (SJL) estimated
shading for all plants.” This method appears to me (as far as I can consider) as too simplistic. Why were not
photos taken from each plant from above, and the overlap quantified?
• Again, we take the point that this is a simple method, but would still argue that as the same
method was applied to all plants the results should not be biased as a result. Similar (though
often slightly more complex) methods are not uncommon in botanical field studies. Over
larger areas, however, it is useful to divide areas into smaller quadrats and estimate shading
in each quadrat. In this case, however, the area covered by each individual plant was often
too small for this to be practical. In the future, if more field workers are available, it might
be valuable to average estimates over two to three observers (the same observers each time)
to remove some observer bias.
7) For evaluation whether the proportion of adult pitchers might increase as a function of plant age, why not
simply recording one plant from above during one growth period? There are affordable outdoor time-lapse
cameras available for this purpose.
• This is a valuable suggestion for a future study, but for this study the time period for
completion was too short to allow measures of plant growth, and we do not have the
requested data available.
8) L. 227: “This unexpected damage, however, provided an additional and intriguing result, namely that
larvae apparently enhance pitcher survival after damage.” Could the authors provide a speculation on how
this would work? I am expecting at least some ideas from the authors.
• A discussion of this interesting finding is provided in L347-L360.
9) L. 264: “…Bazile et al. [17] showed that the infaunal ant C. schmitzii r” For avoiding confusion, the
authors should add that this animal was found inside Nepenthes pitchers.
• We have now added the name of the host: Nepenthes bicalcarata. L279.
Reviewer 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript of Limbery et al. has been significantly improved compared to its previous version. I was
sensitive to the attention paid by the authors to my comments. However, there are still missing information
concerning data analyses. Moreover several other points still require some attention.
• We thank the reviewer for their positive comments, and for acknowledging our efforts in
responding to previous suggestions.
Title
- First, I prefer the previous title, which delivers a broader message than the current one and because one
cannot speak of an association between a ‘density’ of flies … but rather of a correlation between the density
of flies and the carnivorous investment in the pitcher plant. Possibly consider this other proposition:
“Context-dependence influence of a symbiotic fly on the carnivorous investment of its pitcher plant”
• We also prefer our previous title, but changed it in order to reduce the strength of our
conclusions regarding mutualistic or parasitic effects (a criticism of both reviewers on our
previous submission). As recommended, we have switched back to the original title.
Abstract
- P2L20 In the sentence I do not understand the “but” marking an opposition. There is not opposition
here because the infauna influences the allocation in the carnivorous structures using the same pathway, i.e.
also by affecting the nutrient availability to the plant. I suggest to instead writing “Carnivorous plants
allocate more resources to carnivorous structures under nutrient-limited conditions. As the infauna which
lives in association with these plants and feed on their prey may influence the plant’s nutrient availability, we
investigate …”
• The “but” has now been removed. L20.
- Also better writing “Although the sign of the correlation between density of B. ambulans larvae and
relative investment in carnivorous and non-carnivorous structures depends on ….” instead of “Although the
association of B. ambulans larvae with relative investment in carnivorous and non-carnivorous structures
depends on ….”
• This sentence has now been adjusted in accordance with the reviewer’s suggestion. L28.
Introduction
- P3L54, yes cite 17 as an example of how infauna affects prey assimilation positively but do not cite 17 as
an example of how infauna affects prey assimilation negatively : remove 17 in [17,19]
• Bazile et al. has been removed, as suggested. L54.
- P3L59, there are several other alternative responses, publication 17 is cited as if it was an exception and
should be cited among others.
• Bazile et al. has been cited here not as the only exception, but rather as a notable example.
- “any examination of the effect of infauna on carnivorous investment should therefore be coupled with an
investigation of the nutrient status of the host” : The sentence should be changed in “Therefore any
investigation of the nature (mutualism or parasitism) of the plant-infauna relationship should not be limited to
an examination of the effect of the infauna on carnivorous investment but should also be coupled with an
examination of the nutrient status of the plant.”
• This sentence has been adjusted as suggested. L60-L61.
- “Association between infauna and a) the relative number of new carnivorous structures…: better put:
“relationship between infauna density and a) the relative number of new carnivorous structures…”
• Adjusted as suggested. L63-L64.
- P4L74 what do you mean by distribution?
• This has now been changed to “density.” L75.
Material and Methods
- P9 L188-189 Justify why measuring plant total N content and delta15N. If you think they are of
additional utility & information then please give their means before (when possible) and after manipulation
for treated plants and untreated plants in the result section (table 3 or supplementary tables) as well as
appropriate tests and parameter estimates.
• We have added a justification of these metrics at L192-L199. The means are now reported
in supplementary tables 6 and 9. Results of the model comparisons are presented in
supplementary tables 4, 5, 7 and 8.
Results
- My previous question concerning the first analysis was the following: In table 1, I do not understand
why the first model including the parameter ‘shading’, which has a lower AIC (despite more parameters) than
the third model including only ‘PP’, ‘density’ and their interaction was not kept. In other terms, I would like
to see the contribution of “shading” (and its degree of significance) to the variance of proportion of pitcher
buds.
The response of the authors was: On L126-L128 we explain why we retained the third, rather than the
first model from table 1, which is because all models within 2 AIC units of the top model are considered to
have equivalent explanatory power, and we follow Arnold (2010) in selecting the most parsimonious model
with the fewest parameters. Once the whole-model selection process has been conducted objectively in this
manner, parameter estimates for variables that are not in the model cannot be derived.
I am sorry but this response does not satisfy me: to make the choice between the two models and to judge if it
is relevant to remove the variable ‘shading’, it is important to compare the contribution of the different
explanatory variables to the variance of the dependent variable in the most complete model. The results of the
tests are lacking for this model which had though the lowest AIC. Therefore the reader cannot judge
objectively whether the authors’ choice to remove ‘shading’ was relevant.
• We are sorry that the reviewer continues to disagree with us on the appropriate approach to
model comparison. The approach we have taken is widely recognised as valid and
appropriate from the information theoretic perspective, as recognised by Reviewer Two in
our previous submission (McCullugh and Nelder 1989, Bolker et al. 2008, Arnold 2010). In
this approach, whole model comparisons are made to determine whether the inclusion or
exclusion of particular variables significantly changes the likelihood of a model being the
“best” model. This approach leads, as we have stated, to the selection of the most
parsimonious model within two AIC units of the top model (McCullugh and Nelder 1989,
Bolker et al. 2008, Arnold 2010). Given Reviewer One’s continued preference to see the
results of the top model, rather than the most parsimonious model, we have implemented a
compromise which we hope will be satisfactory to the editors. We have now presented the
results of the top model, provided that this model is not within two AIC units of the null
model. If a model is within two AIC units of the null model, this is recognised as a lack of
strong evidence for an effect of any of the predictors.
- P6L132-139. and supplementary table S1
I suggested testing the effect of plant age on the proportion of pitcher buds. This variable is able to
significantly influence the investment in carnivory as attested by the arising problem of collinearity reported
by the authors who, as I was expecting, found a correlation (which deserves to be shown, sign and p-value)
between plant age and proportion of adult pitchers (PP). I follow the authors when they try to test the
variable ‘age’ instead of the variable ‘PP’ (Supplementary table 1) but I do not understand the authors when
this time they decided to keep the variable “shading” in all the models that have been compared. Does this
means that ‘shading’ was this time considered as a good predictor of the percentage of pitcher buds? Why not
presenting the analogous model (and AIC) to the one which was finally retained, i.e. the model including as
explanatory variables Age Density Age X Density ? To my point of view, there is some incoherence in the
method. Whatever the results of the analysis, it might equally be interesting to show that the nature
(mutualism or parasitism) of the plant-fly relationship changes with the age of the plant.
• Again, we are sorry for the continued misunderstanding over our statistical approach. The
results of the model comparisons with “age” instead of PP are presented in supplementary
tables 1, 3, 5 and 8. There also seems to be some confusion over the reason that age and PP
were not included in the same model. The reason that these variables cannot be included in
the same model is that the measure of plant age as suggested by the reviewer on our
previous submission is simply total number of adult leaves. This measurement is of course
included in the calculation of PP and therefore the two cannot be analysed together (this is
known as a ‘spurious correlation’ because one variable is calculated from the other;
therefore there is no need for an explicit test of collinearity in this case). As discussed
above, any variables which are included in models within 2 AIC units of the top model have
been retained. e.g. If “shading” is retained in a particular model (such as in the models of
carnivorous investment using “age” instead of “PP”), this would indicate that that model
was within 2 AIC units of the top model. The results of model comparisons when age is
included are different for those when PP is included simply by virtue of the fact that the
models themselves are different. e.g. For the carnivorous investment analyses, PP evidently
has greater explanatory power than age (since age was non-significant) and this affects
which other variables are included in the final model.
- Moreover, regarding the whole analysis, a matrix of correlation of the different variables (proportion of
old pitchers, proportion of pitcher buds, age, shading, density; C:N) would provide far more information
than all the supplementary tables, which concerns AIC-based model comparisons and does not provide any
parameter estimates. VIF presented in the main manuscript are comparatively of limited informative value
regarding collinearity. We need to know not only the magnitude but also the sign of the correlations.
• The reason we have not included magnitudes and signs of correlations in our manuscript is
that in all cases when collinearity was tested, it was found not to adversely influence our
analyses. This conclusion was arrived at based on the accepted method of interpreting
VIF’s (Baird and Middleton 2004). Had the VIF’s shown collinearity to be a problem with
the variables included in the same model, the magnitude and sign of correlation would have
been reported. Given that this is not the case, we felt that further information regarding non-
significant correlations would be of limited interest to the readers, especially since their
inclusion would greatly increase the number of tables in the manuscript. If, however, the
editor feels that these tables should be included even though the correlations are not
significant, they are of course simple enough for us to provide as electronic supplementary
material.
- As regards the analysis of C:N, in the different models tested as shown in table4, did you try to test the
model: treatment PP treatment X PP (idem for age instead of PP) ? In the supplementary table S2, why not
testing the model with age alone? Please provide parameter estimates.
• As described in the model comparison section of our methods, all possible models were
compared in each case, but we have only presented all models within 2 AIC units of the top
model. If a particular model is not presented, then it was more than 2 AIC units from the
top model.
Discussion
- P11L236 “that had greater proportion of adult pitchers” instead of “many adult pitchers”.
