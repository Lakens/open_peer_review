RSOS – 170948 Review
Molecular mechanism of viscoelastic polymer enhanced-oil-recovery in nanopores
This paper describes a molecular dynamics study of multiphase displacement in a single slot
shaped channel with a side trough. Having periodic boundary conditions the side-pore is
extended in the y-direction.
The paper makes extremely strong assertions that are not substantiated by the material
presented. There are a variety of statements made about the polymer system which are also
suspect and which are not demonstrated to be valid. Last, the paper seems to be at pains to
molecularly demonstrate a pre-conceived notion of “pulling” of oil from a pore. Were it to
convincingly demonstrate (or refute) this latter that would be excellent, unfortunately it does not.
Whereas the simulation is potentially of interest, the presentation is confused and incomplete and
therefore should not be published in its current form.
The abstract and introduction confuses the reader at the outset: polymer enhanced oil recovery is
typically used in porous systems with permeability greater than 10’s of mD for the simple reason
that the usual polymer molecules have a radius of gyration of order 0.1micron (though obviously
molecular weight dependent and possibly salinity dependent). Hence there is well known
filtration and blockage when polymers are pumped into low permeability formations. So,
polymer flooding in “ultratight” formations (industry jargon for very low permeability) is not
usual. Confusing standard methodologies with nanoporous flow is unhelpful.
The scale of the problem means that the “polymers” used for the MD simulation are very small.
In the calculation the polymer molecules are injected without solvent so perhaps the calculation
should be more appropriately be considered as a polymer melt injection. The absence of solvent
hugely increases the relative effects being considered. Further, it is not clear whether the oil is
modelled as complete molecules (i.e. as fig 1b,c,d) or coarse grained (as for the polymer fig 1e.).
None of the parameters chosen for the simulation are specified and hence no other worker can
reproduce or extend the present study and it is unclear what physical parameter space is being
considered.
Because of the lack of detail provided many questions arise. However particular issues relate to
the assumed state of the polymer (unjustified), the flow conditions modelled (unspecified) and
inferences for the oilfield situation (inappropriately extrapolated).
The polymer is stated as being entangled. However, no evidence is provided that this is the case,
e.g. how many entanglements per strand? For an entangled system one might expect the plot of
6(a) to exhibit a plateau, it doesn’t appear to. In fact terminal time appears to scale approximately
with N^2 as it should for Rouse time. If an aqueous solvent were present then the adhesion force
of the polymer to the oil would be commensurately less. Fig.2 shows polymer molecules
interspersed with the oil drop suggesting miscibility further suggesting zero interfacial tension
which is not a physical situation. Note that this is not the case for the water situation. No
mention is made of the obvious polymer concentration gradients. The absolute terminal time is
3
approx.. 10^-8 s implying that for a Weissenberg number of 1, where we expect elastic forces to
become important, the shear rate will be in excess of 10^8 s^-1. The flow rates are not stated, but
since the polymers are extended I assume this is approximately the shear rate modelled and
hence a huge pressure gradient across the calculation. This, together with the form of the
polymer, is clearly unphysical and hence to make any conjectures about oilfield applications is
dangerous at best.

pore diameter is on the micrometer scale. However, there are a large number of nanopores in
shale (unconventional) formations, leading to the permeability ~6 orders of magnitude smaller

shale is less than 10% and the water is very difficult to be injected into the ultratight formation. In
other words, to the best of my knowledge, polymer flooding has never been utilized in a shale

As mentioned by McInerney et al. 2005, the physicochemical properties of the oil reservoirs are
highly variable and a generic process for oil recovery cannot be defined. Besides, there are a
number of factors that play role in limiting the success of the flooding process. The authors have
explained a pulling mechanism that occurs at a nanoscale dimension during polymer flooding
but have not included factors that also affects this in the recovery process (polymer retention,
pore throat plugging, low permeability). There are a significant number of factors that affects the
oil displacement efficiency of polymers which have not been considered. “Propagation of
polymers become more difficult if the pore size, becomes closer to macromolecular length. Also,
plugging is a serious issue increasing as the permeability decreases which further limits the
success of oil recovery process.” (Rellegadla et al. 2017). Addressing these factors and then
explaining how the polymer displacement can significantly recover oil trapped in the nanopores
would rather be a more complete information.
1.) Reference needed in, Line No. 12-16, Page 8, “After the reservoir…… remains uncovered”
2.) Line no. 30-36, Page 9, “The improvement of recovery …… dead ends using polymer
flooding”. Statement should be revised as other mechanisms can also contribute to the increase
recovery.
3.) Line no. 41-48, Page 18, “The viscosity of polymer solution increases with an increase in its
molecular weight and leads to higher oil production. But, with increasing molecular weight,
plugging can be as issue and can prove deleterious for oil recovery. Increasing the chain length
from N=150 to N=250 is increasing the recovery of trapped oil, indicating more polymers are
needed for more recovery. Though in field conditions, this mechanism is limited, owing to a
number of factors (plugging, increased adsorption, increased economics with increased
requirement of polymer etc.). Discussing these facts can help compare this in silico work to real
field conditions more appropriately.
By addressing all the abovementioned issues in the details the revised manuscript can be
considered for publication in RSOS.
Good Luck.

In this manuscript, the authors investigated how polymer flooding improves oil recovery
efficiency at the molecular scale using MD simulations. The findings are of considerable interest
and bring some new insights into this issue. A pulling effect mechanism was proposed and the
influence of viscoelasticity of polymer was analyzed. Generally, the manuscript was well
organized and the results are convincing. I think this work can provide theoretical guidance for
practical oil recovery processes.
In addition, the revision and response with respect to previous reviewers are appropriate and
adequate.
Hence, I recommend the acceptance of this manuscript for publication in Royal Society Open
Science with minor revision:
1. In page 6, line 18-23, “A large amount of residual … of water flooding.” It’s better to add some
references here.
2. In page 11, line 28, what is the structure of “initial polymer”? Please provide more information.

3. Please clarify V in equation (3.1). Is it the volume of the simulation box?
By addressing these concerns, the revised manuscript can be considered to be published.

In this manuscript, the authors investigated how polymer flooding improves oil recovery
efficiency at the molecular scale using MD simulations. The findings are of considerable interest
and bring some new insights into this issue. A pulling effect mechanism was proposed and the
influence of viscoelasticity of polymer was analyzed. Generally, the manuscript was well
organized and the results are convincing. I think this work can provide theoretical guidance for
practical oil recovery processes.

Appendix A
Response to Referees
Reviewer: 1
This paper describes a molecular dynamics study of multiphase displacement in a single slot shaped
channel with a side trough. Having periodic boundary conditions the side-pore is extended in the y-
direction. The paper makes extremely strong assertions that are not substantiated by the material
presented. There are a variety of statements made about the polymer system which are also suspect
and which are not demonstrated to be valid. Last, the paper seems to be at pains to molecularly
demonstrate a pre-conceived notion of “pulling” of oil from a pore. Were it to convincingly
demonstrate (or refute) this latter that would be excellent, unfortunately it does not. Whereas the
simulation is potentially of interest, the presentation is confused and incomplete and therefore
should not be published in its current form.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the overall evaluations and valuable comments on our work.
These comments help to improve the quality of our work. We have revised the manuscript based on
these suggestions.
The abstract and introduction confuses the reader at the outset: polymer enhanced oil recovery is
typically used in porous systems with permeability greater than 10’s of mD for the simple reason
that the usual polymer molecules have a radius of gyration of order 0.1micron (though obviously
molecular weight dependent and possibly salinity dependent). Hence there is well known filtration
and blockage when polymers are pumped into low permeability formations. So, polymer flooding
in “ultratight” formations (industry jargon for very low permeability) is not usual. Confusing
standard methodologies with nanoporous flow is unhelpful.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the constructive comment to the abstract and introduction of
our manuscript. Polymer enhanced oil recovery is indeed not suitable for “ultratight” formations.
We revised and explained our motivation of the current work and we think it is necessary and
meaningful to investigate the displacement mechanism of at micro/nano scale because polymer
flooding is reported to improve microscopic displacement efficiency. Although the oil reservoirs
that polymer flooding is typically used for are not characterized with ultratight slit pores, as there is
residual oil trapped in the microscopic pores, there is potential improvement of oil recovery
efficiency. Therefore, we built this model to investigate the microscopic displacement mechanism
of polymer flooding. Moreover, it should be noted that MD simulation has its own limitation, so the
flow model is a simplified model which takes the key characteristics into consideration. In the
revised manuscript, we have modified the background of polymer flooding and removed all the
clarifications and discussions on unconventional reservoirs, “ultratight” formations and shale
formations, and replaced them with conventional reservoirs.
The scale of the problem means that the “polymers” used for the MD simulation are very small. In
the calculation the polymer molecules are injected without solvent so perhaps the calculation should
be more appropriately be considered as a polymer melt injection. The absence of solvent hugely
increases the relative effects being considered. Further, it is not clear whether the oil is modelled
as complete molecules (i.e. as fig 1b,c,d) or coarse grained (as for the polymer fig 1e.). None of
the parameters chosen for the simulation are specified and hence no other worker can reproduce or
extend the present study and it is unclear what physical parameter space is being considered.
Response: As the reviewer pointed out, in petroleum engineering, solvent is often used with
polymer to reduce the interfacial tension. However, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect
of polymers on oil recovery alone, and it is difficult to take all the situations into consideration in
MD simulations. Hence the model we built contains only polymers. Owing to the limitation of MD
simulations, the scale of polymers and oil droplet is small indeed, which may be different from real
situations. However, since our research focuses on the displacing mechanism, this simplified model
is acceptable for investigating the displacing process. This kind of treatment is often used when
studying oil detachment from solid surface with MD simulations. Please refer to: (1) F.C. Wang and
H.A. Wu, Soft matter, 2013, 9, 7974-7980; (2) W.K. Xie et al., Applied Surface Science, 2017, 426,
504-513; (3) J.X. Chen et al., Applied Surface Science, 2015, 353, 670-678; (4) Y.G. Yan et al., Fuel,
2017, 190, 253-259.
The polymer is modelled as coarse grained molecules (KG model [32]) which has been widely used
in the field of polymer science. The parameters for the polymers were given in our manuscript as e
= 0.592 kcal/mol and s = 2.5 Å. The oil is modelled as a mixture of heptane, decane and toluene.
The parameters of interactions among these hydrocarbon molecules were given in Ref. [35] and
hence we did not list the numerous parameters specifically in our manuscript. We added the
manuscript to include the interaction parameters for oil–wall, polymer–wall and oil-polymer (Table
1 in the revised manuscript).
Because of the lack of detail provided many questions arise. However particular issues relate to the
assumed state of the polymer (unjustified), the flow conditions modelled (unspecified) and
inferences for the oilfield situation (inappropriately extrapolated).
The polymer is stated as being entangled. However, no evidence is provided that this is the case,
e.g. how many entanglements per strand? For an entangled system one might expect the plot of 6(a)
to exhibit a plateau, it doesn’t appear to. In fact terminal time appears to scale approximately with
N^2 as it should for Rouse time. If an aqueous solvent were present then the adhesion force of the
polymer to the oil would be commensurately less. Fig.2 shows polymer molecules interspersed with
the oil drop suggesting miscibility further suggesting zero interfacial tension which is not a physical
situation. Note that this is not the case for the water situation. No mention is made of the obvious
polymer concentration gradients. The absolute terminal time is approx.. 10^-8 s implying that for
a Weissenberg number of 1, where we expect elastic forces to become important, the shear rate will
be in excess of 10^8 s^-1. The flow rates are not stated, but since the polymers are extended I assume
this is approximately the shear rate modelled and hence a huge pressure gradient across the
calculation. This, together with the form of the polymer, is clearly unphysical and hence to make
any conjectures about oilfield applications is dangerous at best.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the helpful comments. The reason for the claim of
entanglements although there is no plateau in Figure 6(a) can be explained as follows. As described
in Ref. [40], which our analyses of polymer’s viscoelasticity are main based on, the plot of G(t)t1/2
can give clear comparison between our model and Rouse model. As shown in Figure R1(a), there
are clear deviations from the Rouse theory due to entanglements. Hence we claim the polymer to be
entangled. Furthermore, although we can’t give clear quantitative description of entanglement in
our simulations, the phenomenon of entanglement can be observed in the structure of polymer
chains, as shown in Figure R1(b). These representative structures are randomly selected from all the
flowing polymer chains, which provides evidence of polymers’ entanglement.
Figure R1. (a) Stress relaxation for the polymers, normalized by the Rouse behavior t-1/2. The
horizontal line corresponds to pure Rouse behavior. (b) Some typical snapshots of two polymer
chains entangled with each other.
The reviewer also pointed out that polymer molecules interspersed with the oil droplet. Since the
scale of the system is small, surface effect is strong, resulting in strong activity and instability of the
oil particles. This phenomenon can also be observed in other studies concerning microscopic oil
problems. Please refer to: (1) Y.G. Yan et al., Fuel, 2017, 190, 253-259; (2) T.M. Fang et al.,
Chemical Engineering Science, 2017, 164, 17-22; (3) B. Liu et al., Energy & Fuels, 2017, 31, 738-
746. Moreover, the oil droplet can still maintain its shape, which indicates those hydrocarbon
molecules are not completely miscible with polymers.
The concentration gradient of polymers is caused by the blockage of the up-going oil droplet in the
channel. As the oil droplet is pulled out, it blocks the flowing polymers in the channel and polymers
tend to gather near the oil droplet, resulting in the concentration gradient of polymers. We have
added this clarification to the revised manuscript.
As for the flow model, in actual working condition, flooding agent flow is driven by the pressure
gradient. Here we applied a constant external force along the flow direction to each polymer
monomer, which is an equivalent method of pressure-driven flow and commonly used in MD
simulations. The flow rate is about 4×10-15 m3/s. As we explained previously, due to the prominent
surface effect, the interactions in the system is very strong. Hence a higher pressure gradient is
needed to drive the flow. We have made more clarifications on this point in the revised manuscript.
Moreover, it should be noted that the analyses on the stress relaxation modulus G(t) are based on
simulations of pure polymers in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions in three directions,
which are different from flow simulations. These simulations are carried out individually to
investigate the viscoelastic property of polymers.

This work presents a molecular dynamics study of viscoelastic polymer enhanced-oil recovery in
nanopores. This is of fundamental interest and may help to understand the mechanisms at the atomic
scale. I recommend the acceptance of this work with minor revision.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the overall evaluations and comments which help to improve
the quality of our work. We have revised the manuscript based on these suggestions.
1. Perhaps the authors have made a mistake in the background of polymer flooding. Page 3, line 18,
the authors claim that after waterflooding, more than 50% OOIP remains uncovered in ultratight
shale formations. Actually, this information applies to conventional reservoirs, whose pore diameter
is on the micrometer scale. However, there are a large number of nanopores in shale (unconventional)
formations, leading to the permeability ~6 orders of magnitude smaller than that of conventional
reservoirs. Therefore, it is commonly believed that the oil recovery in shale is less than 10% and the
water is very difficult to be injected into the ultratight formation. In other words, to the best of my
knowledge, polymer flooding has never been utilized in a shale play. Maybe the authors need to
remove all the discussions on unconventional reservoirs. This study makes perfect sense in
conventional reservoirs.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the critical comment and kind assessment to our manuscript.
Polymer enhanced oil recovery is indeed not suitable for “ultratight” formations. However, we think
it is still necessary and meaningful to investigate the displacement mechanism of at micro/nano
scale because polymer flooding is reported to improve microscopic displacement efficiency.
Although the oil reservoirs that polymer flooding is typically used for are not characterized with
ultratight slit pores, as there is residual oil trapped in the microscopic pores, there is potential
improvement of oil recovery efficiency. In the revised manuscript, as the reviewer suggested, we
have removed all the discussions on applying polymer flooding to unconventional reservoirs, and
changed them into conventional reservoirs.

3. Page 8, line 32. Please provide more details to explain how these parameters were chosen to
prevent chains from crossing each other.
Response: In fact, the reason for choosing these parameters was given in Ref. [32] as we cited
thereby. That is, the spring constant is strong enough so that the maximum extension of the bond is
always less than 1.2s for kBT = 1.0e, which makes bond crossing energetically infeasible. To clarify
this point, we have added this explanation in the revised manuscript.
4. Page 10, line 54. The meaning of PV is different from its original definition. In petroleum
engineering, PV is defined as the ratio of the volume of flooding agent to the pore volume. However,
in this work, it is defined as “the ratio of accumulated number of atoms flowing across the boundary
in X direction to the total atom number”. The total atom number of which? I think the denominator
in this definition can be the volume of the open pore. Or please explain why this definition is used?
Response: Indeed, the definition of PV in petroleum engineering is the ratio of volumes, and we
used the ratio of atom numbers. This is because in our MD simulations, the volume of flooding
agent is proportional to the polymer atom number which is easy to be measured. Moreover, since
periodic boundary conditions are applied in the flow direction (X) and the polymer atom number
used in our MD model is constant, the atom number of the all the injected polymer should be
measured as the accumulated number of atoms flowing across the boundary in X direction. The
denominator in our definition is the constant number of polymers used in our MD model which is
proportional to the volume of the open pore. Therefore, our definition using the ratio of atom
numbers is an equivalent way to calculate the ratio of volumes. In the revision, we have made more
clarifications on this point.

Response: Thanks for this reminding. We deleted that sentence in the revision.
Appendix B
Response to Referees
Reviewer: 3
As mentioned by McInerney et al. 2005, the physicochemical properties of the oil reservoirs are
highly variable and a generic process for oil recovery cannot be defined. Besides, there are a number
of factors that play role in limiting the success of the flooding process. The authors have explained
a pulling mechanism that occurs at a nanoscale dimension during polymer flooding but have not
included factors that also affects this in the recovery process (polymer retention, pore throat
plugging, low permeability). There are a significant number of factors that affects the oil
displacement efficiency of polymers which have not been considered. “Propagation of polymers
become more difficult if the pore size, becomes closer to macromolecular length. Also, plugging is
a serious issue increasing as the permeability decreases which further limits the success of oil
recovery process.” (Rellegadla et al. 2017). Addressing these factors and then explaining how the
polymer displacement can significantly recover oil trapped in the nanopores would rather be a more
complete information.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the overall evaluations and valuable comments on our work.
These comments help to improve the quality of our work. We have revised the manuscript
accordingly.

2.) Line no. 30-36, Page 9, “The improvement of recovery …… dead ends using polymer
flooding”. Statement should be revised as other mechanisms can also contribute to the increase
recovery.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. This statement has been modified into “The
additional oil extraction in dead ends plays an important role in the improvement of recovery
efficiency using polymer flooding” for clarity in the revision (Line No. 30-36, Page 6).
3.) Line no. 41-48, Page 18, “The viscosity of polymer solution increases with an increase in its
molecular weight and leads to higher oil production. But, with increasing molecular weight,
plugging can be as issue and can prove deleterious for oil recovery. Increasing the chain length from
N=150 to N=250 is increasing the recovery of trapped oil, indicating more polymers are needed for
more recovery. Though in field conditions, this mechanism is limited, owing to a number of factors
(plugging, increased adsorption, increased economics with increased requirement of polymer etc.).
Discussing these facts can help compare this in silico work to real field conditions more
appropriately.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the constructive comment. The reviewer is correct in that
when increasing polymer chain length, many issues occur (plugging, increased adsorption,
increased economics etc.) which are deleterious for oil recovery in real field conditions. We have
added the following clarification to provide a comprehensive description of the effect of increasing
chain length on polymer flooding. (Line No. 11-33, Page 16).
“It should be noted that increasing chain length of polymer can also bring issues that are deleterious
for oil recovery in real field conditions. For example, if polymer chain is too long, plugging and
increased adsorption will occur and affect the propagation of polymer [4]. Also, using long chain
polymer requires more polymer to be injected, which will increase the cost of oil recovery. In
addition, since the properties of the oil reservoirs are highly variable, a general flooding agent for
oil recovery cannot be defined [40]. Therefore, it is not suggested to increase the chain length of
polymer to a very large value. The issues of plugging, increased adsorption and increased economics
should be taken into consideration when choosing the appropriate polymer chain length.
