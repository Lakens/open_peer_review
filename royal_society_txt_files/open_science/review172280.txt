The manuscript "Synthetic explorations of the briarane jungle: Progress in developing a synthetic
route to a common family of diterpenoid natural products" by Moon and Harned provides a
timely review of recent synthetic efforts toward the briarane diterpenoids featuring the
stereoselective construction of the central sterotetrad and a trans-fused ring system. These
information will collectively guide future development in the synthesis of this type of interesting
molecular scaffold.

Authors provided a mini review on synthesis of diterpenoid briarane natural products. It's a
unique topic and might be useful for a group of people working in the area of natural product
synthesis. Manuscript can be published in its current form.
