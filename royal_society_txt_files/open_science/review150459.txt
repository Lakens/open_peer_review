This manuscript is a nicely written and interesting contribution to the rapidly growing literature
about contagious yawning as a measure of empathy. My suggestions for revision are minor and
concern broadening the scope of the article, primarily of the introduction, to include more
information about the motor act of yawning, its contagion, and the general topic of the sexual
dimorphism of spontaneous yawning. I'm not suggesting that this empirical report include a
comprehensive review, but that it cite a wider range of seminal research to guide readers who
want to learn more.
Page 4. Set the stage for the present work by citing evidence of the wide range of sensory
modes that are vectors for contagious yawning of humans, ranging from hearing (Arnott et al,
2009, ref 33), seeing (Provine, 1986, ref 49, 50), reading about (Provine, 1986, ref 49), or even
thinking about yawning (Provine, 1986, ref 49).
Page 4. Describe the motor act of human yawning, considering their frequency, duration
and mechanism (Provine, ref 49). Beyond their contagiousness, what makes yawns an interesting
topic for neurobehavioral research? Walusinski (2010) provides a useful collection of chapters by
leading researchers.
Page 4. Given the focus of the present paper, more should be said about the remarkable
dimorphism of spontaneous yawning in other mammals. Remarkably, Phoenix and Chambers
(Biology of Reproduction, 35, 1986, 918-926) report that in Rhesus macaques, 'It is ironic that T,
"the male sex hormone," is more closely associated with the yawning rate than with the mounting
or intromission rates.' Schino and Aureli ("Do men yawn more than women," Ethology and
Sociobiology, 10, 1989, 375-378), note that such androgen-driven dimorphism is not present in
humans, where both male and females yawn equally often. The present treatment of dimorphic
contagious yawning builds upon this line of research and it should be cited.
Page 4, paragraph 3. The authors' note that 40-60% of observers don't yawn contagiously
in lab conditions. What is a reasonable proportion? What is the expected penetrance of a
genetically programmed, neurobehavioral trait? The knee-jerk is expressed in almost everyone
(99+%). How does contagious yawning compare? The finding that about half of participants
yawn contagiously in lab settings is impressive, given the typical observation interval of five
minutes, and the inhibitory consequence of being observed. My comments are prompted by the
authors' focus on the negative, the rate of those who don't, as opposed to those who do yawn
contagiously.
Page 10, second paragraph. "The completely new finding……" of more contagious
yawning in females than males is interesting. Consider whether this disparity and presumed
correlation with empathy is due to differences in a hypothetical neurological mechanism or
simply to the greater attention of females than males to faces and other stimuli that trigger
contagious yawning. What about the possibility of the data collectors being more attentive of the
responses of female than male subjects? Is there dimorphism" of observer behavior? Are males
more effective at stimulating yawns than females, and what about sex effects of observers? The
lack of significant difference in spontaneous yawn frequencies between men and women
confirms Schino and Aureli (1989) and may a uniquely human pattern.

label_comment_2
This paper reports a primary research with rigorous methodology. The results are original, and I
believe they meet the standard for publication in Royal Society Open Science. I have a few
comments on the data presentation and the discussion.
Methods
p5. I wonder if this is the original dataset, or there's any overlap with the dataset previously
published by the same research group (Norscia & Palagi, 2011). If the latter is the case, it needs to
be declared here.
p7. There could be several typos here. Firstly, the close kinship should be r "more than" .25, rather
than "less than" it. Similarly, dubious cases of kinship could be r "less than or equals" .25, such as
half-sibling or farther. I also think the best model should have "lowest" AIC rather than "lower"?
Results
p8. I believe it is beneficial to discuss effect sizes here. How many percentages of the variance in
the population the receiver's sex explain? Can we say whether the effect is large, medium or
small?
Discussion
- It is curious that trigger’s sex had no effect, which contrast with a previous Gelada study. Can
the authors discuss this difference?
- The results of the reported study are clearly inconsistent with Bartolomew and Cirulli (2014). It
would be beneficial to discuss the possible sources of inconsistency, such as the different method,
power, target population etc.
- Last couple of sentences seems to be out of place, and is not linked to the main results of the
paper. Contagious yawning is a multimodal phenomenon, and simply blocking visual access to
face shouldn't stop contagious yawning happen via other modality. And the current results
showed that the effect of sex in human is limited to the receiver's side, so it seems irrelevant to
the effect of masking sender's face. I suggest these sentences (and corresponding section of
abstract) should be removed for coherence, but if authors decided otherwise, a more thorough
discussion and justification should be included to corroborate this claim.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Antonia Hamilton):
This is an observational study of yawning, but it is not clear how the authors can obtain good
validity with pure observation (no video or verification). The sample size is also small for this
type of analysis.

Keywords: yawn contagion susceptibility, humans, empathy, female bias, social bonding ,
empathic gradient
Abstract: Psychological, clinical and neurobiological findings endorse that empathic abilities are
more developed in women than in men. Since there is growing evidence that yawn contagion is
an empathy-based phenomenon, we expect that the female bias in the empathic abilities reflects
on a gender skew in the responsiveness to others’ yawns. We verified this assumption by
applying a linear model on a dataset gathered during a five-year period of naturalistic
observations on humans. Gender, age, and social bond were included in the analysis as fixed
factors. The social bond and the receiver’s gender remained in the best model. The rates of
contagion were significantly lower between acquaintances than between friends and family
members, and significantly higher in women than in men. These results not only confirm that
yawn contagion is sensitive to social closeness but also that the phenomenon is affected by the
same gender bias affecting empathy. The sex skew, also found in other non-human species, fits
with the female social roles which are likely to require higher empathic abilities (e.g., parental
care, group cohesion maintenance, social mediation). The fact that female influence in social
dynamics may rely on face-to-face emotional exchange raises concerns on the negative
repercussions of having women’s facial expressions forcibly concealed.

SWER: as in any properly carried out observational study, and as also acknowledged by the reviewers,
data collection followed a rigid and scientifically grounded protocol. Ethology would not exist
erwise. The whole protocol is described in the paper and with respect to observations' validation we
cified that "the three authors collected the data and before starting systematic data collection, inter-
erver reliability was tested during a 10-day concurrent trial period, until Cohen’s kappas (k) were =
5".
method has its own limits. The most appropriate approach depends on the scientific question to be
wered. Lab approach, with controlled conditions, is not bias exempt. Literature reports that
aviour and emotional expression can be inhibited or modified when subjects are uprooted from their
ural context and when they are aware to be under investigation. Thus, natural behaviour can be
wed as a result of artificial conditions. This is particularly true for yawn contagion which has been
onstrated to suffer from subjects' awareness of being observed (as also noted by the first reviewer).
don't know how to object to the second issue because for us it not an issue. Unless we are told what
would be a good size for this type of analysis. Our database included 1461 natural, not simulated
ns collected over five years. The analyses were carried on 104 spontaneous yawners (triggers)
erved for at least 120 minutes, and 92 dyads, because we wanted to ensure independent occasions of
n contagion (please see the manuscript for details). This amount of data, difficult to obtain in
trolled conditions, allows carrying out reliable statistical analyses. Of course, in the future, with a
her expanded database, further split analyses will be possible (maybe in another five years).

manuscript is a nicely written and interesting contribution to the rapidly growing literature about
tagious yawning as a measure of empathy. My suggestions for revision are minor and concern
adening the scope of the article, primarily of the introduction, to include more information about the
or act of yawning, its contagion, and the general topic of the sexual dimorphism of spontaneous
er range of seminal research to guide readers who want to learn more.
e 4. Set the stage for the present work by citing evidence of the wide range of sensory modes that are
tors for contagious yawning of humans, ranging from hearing (Arnott et al, 2009, ref 33), seeing
vine, 1986, ref 49, 50), reading about (Provine, 1986, ref 49), or even thinking about yawning (Provine,
6, ref 49).
SWER: THANKS FOR THE SUGGESTION. WE INCLUDED THIS PART.
e 4. Describe the motor act of human yawning, considering their frequency, duration and mechanism
vine, ref 49). Beyond their contagiousness, what makes yawns an interesting topic for neurobehavioral
arch? Walusinski (2010) provides a useful collection of chapters by leading researchers.
SWER: WE INCLUDED THIS PART.
e 4. Given the focus of the present paper, more should be said about the remarkable dimorphism of
ntaneous yawning in other mammals. Remarkably, Phoenix and Chambers (Biology of Reproduction, 35,
6, 918-926) report that in Rhesus macaques, 'It is ironic that T, "the male sex hormone," is more closely
ociated with the yawning rate than with the mounting or intromission rates.' Schino and Aureli ("Do
n yawn more than women," Ethology and Sociobiology, 10, 1989, 375-378), note that such androgen-
en dimorphism is not present in humans, where both male and females yawn equally often. The
sent treatment of dimorphic contagious yawning builds upon this line of research and it should be cited.
SWER: WE ADDED THIS PART, ALONG WITH THE PREVIOUS ONES, BEFORE DESCRIBING YAWN
NTAGION.
e 4, paragraph 3. The authors' note that 40-60% of observers don't yawn contagiously in lab conditions.
at is a reasonable proportion? What is the expected penetrance of a genetically programmed,
robehavioral trait? The knee-jerk is expressed in almost everyone (99+%). How does contagious
ning compare? The finding that about half of participants yawn contagiously in lab settings is
ressive, given the typical observation interval of five minutes, and the inhibitory consequence of being
erved. My comments are prompted by the authors' focus on the negative, the rate of those who don't,
pposed to those who do yawn contagiously.
SWER: WE AGREE WITH THIS VIEW. HOWEVER, HERE WE DID NOT MEAN TO GIVE ANY NEGATIVE
US BUT WE NEEDED TO STRESS THE FACT THAT NOT ALL PEOPLE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO YAWN
NTAGION BECAUSE THIS STUDY HAD NECESSARILY TO CONSIDER ONLY SUSCEPTIBLE SUBJECTS.
ITCHING THE FOCUS WOULD IMPAIR THE LOGICAL REASONING SO WE HOPE THIS PART CAN BE
EPTED AS IT IS.
e 10, second paragraph. "The completely new finding……" of more contagious yawning in females than
es is interesting. Consider whether this disparity and presumed correlation with empathy is due to
es to faces and other stimuli that trigger contagious yawning. What about the possibility of the data
ectors being more attentive of the responses of female than male subjects? Is there dimorphism" of
erver behavior? Are males more effective at stimulating yawns than females, and what about sex
cts of observers? The lack of significant difference in spontaneous yawn frequencies between men and
men confirms Schino and Aureli (1989) and may a uniquely human pattern.
SWER: REGARDING THE OBSERVERS, WE TESTED THE INTER-OBSERVER RELIABILITY AS REPORTED IN
MS. TO BE CLEARER WE EXPLAINED BETTER THE MODALITY OF OBSERVATION BY ADDING THAT:
L THE POTENTIAL YAWNERS (MEN AND WOMEN) HAD TO BE WITHIN THE RANGE OF THE
REOSCOPIC VIEW OF EACH OBSERVER". THIS MEANS THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO DETECT A
WN, A VIGOROUS SIGNAL, WHATEVER THE SEX OF THE DATA COLLECTOR AND WHATEVER THE SEX OF
YAWNER WAS. MEN ARE NOT MORE EFFECTIVE THAN WOMEN IN TRIGGERING YAWNS, BECAUSE
TRIGGER’S SEX WAS ENTERED AS EXPLAINING VARIABLE IN THE MODEL BUT IT DID NOT REMAIN IN
BEST MODEL. REGARDING THE POSSIBILITY THAT WOMEN ARE MORE ATTENTIVE THAN MEN TO
ES, THIS MAY BE POSSIBLE AND ALSO RELATED TO WOMEN'S EMPATHIC PROPENSITY.

original, and I believe they meet the standard for publication in Royal Society Open Science. I have a
comments on the data presentation and the discussion.
thods
I wonder if this is the original dataset, or there's any overlap with the dataset previously published by
same research group (Norscia & Palagi, 2011). If the latter is the case, it needs to be declared here.
SWER: WE HAS SPECIFIED IN METHODS THAT DATA FROM THE 26TH OF OCTOBER 2010 TO THE 27TH
APRIL 2015 AND WE ALSO INCLUDED THIS STATEMENT IN THE TEXT : “THIS FIVE-YEAR DATASET
LUDES THE ONE-YEAR DATASET USED BY NORSCIA AND PALAGI (2011)”.
There could be several typos here. Firstly, the close kinship should be r "more than" .25, rather than
s than" it. Similarly, dubious cases of kinship could be r "less than or equals" .25, such as half-sibling or
her. I also think the best model should have "lowest" AIC rather than "lower"?
SWER: WE CORRECTED THE TYPOS.
ults
I believe it is beneficial to discuss effect sizes here. How many percentages of the variance in the
ulation the receiver's sex explain? Can we say whether the effect is large, medium or small?
SWER: THE INFORMATION ON THE EFFECT SIZE IS PROVIDED (MEDIUM SIZE)
is curious that trigger’s sex had no effect, which contrast with a previous Gelada study. Can the authors
uss this difference?
SWER: IN GELADAS THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF YAWNS (TYPE 1, 2, AND 3, DEPENDING ON
ETHER TEETH/GUMS ARE COVERED OR NOT). PALAGI ET AL. 2009 FOUND THAT GELADA FEMALES
ITED MATCHED RESPONSE (TYPE 1 PER TYPE 1, TYPE 2 PER TYPE 2…) MORE IN OTHER FEMALES THAN
MALES BUT THE FREQUENCY OF YAWNING RESPONSE DID NOT DIFFER ACCORDING TO THE TRIGGER’S
. SO, THE ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND CANNOT BE USED TO DISCUSS OUR DATA.
e results of the reported study are clearly inconsistent with Bartolomew and Cirulli (2014). It would be
eficial to discuss the possible sources of inconsistency, such as the different method, power, target
ulation etc.
SWER: WE INCLUDED THIS PART IN THE DISCUSSION.
st couple of sentences seems to be out of place, and is not linked to the main results of the paper.
tagious yawning is a multimodal phenomenon, and simply blocking visual access to face shouldn't stop
tagious yawning happen via other modality. And the current results showed that the effect of sex in
an is limited to the receiver's side, so it seems irrelevant to the effect of masking sender's face. I
gest these sentences (and corresponding section of abstract) should be removed for coherence, but if
hors decided otherwise, a more thorough discussion and justification should be included to corroborate
claim.
SWER: WE MODIFIED THE LAST PART TO MAKE IT MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE CONTENT OF OUR
DY AND LITERATURE ON FACE-TO-FACE COMMUNICATION.
