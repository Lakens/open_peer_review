The manuscripts describes an interesting observation - that some humpback whales have
apparently learned to take advantage of a novel prey resource and one that is perhaps (although
this is not made clear) available only at sufficient densities following release from hatcheries. This
observations supports the widely held assertion that humpbacks are generalist feeders with the
capacity to exploit a wide diversity of prey items and that novel feeding strategies can arise
within a population and spread through cultural learning.
However, the appeal of the manuscript is limited by the scope of the work conducted. I was left
with many more questions than answers, for example:
1.Why are there no detailed observations of prey density, foraging behavior, and the response of
prey to the predator?
2. How many individual whales engaged in this behavior? What is their age and sex?
3. How has the behavior spread throughout the population?
4. Why is there no quantitative analysis of the effect of this consumption on the stock
enhancement program?
5. Why is there no consideration of mitigation strategies?
As it stands, the manuscript stands only on the observation that humpback whales consume
hatchery reared and released salmon. That is an interesting observation, but perhaps better suited
for a specialist journal, such as Marine Mammal Science, rather than Open Science.

I found this manuscript to be a well-written description documenting novel feeding behavior and
prey of humpback whales in Southeast Alaska. The study design was very straightforward, and
the statistical analysis appropriate. The authors interpretations and conclusions are well
supported by the data and the analyses. This paper is a meaningful contribution to the literature
on humpback whale feeding ecology, and on factors affecting year-class variation in the marine
survival of hatchery salmon in Southeast Alaska. I have a few minor comments for consideration:
Page 7, lines 18-19: add "sites" after "hatchery release"
Page 9: lines 22-23: Hatcheries have operated in Southeast Alaska since the late 19th century (cite
Roppel, P. 1982. Alaska Salmon hatcheries, 1891-1959. Alaska Pacific Univeersity Press,
Anchorage. 299 pp.). Perhaps restate: "Salmon hatcheries have operated sporadically in Southeast
Alaska since the late 19th century (cite Roppell). In response to low salmon catches and
abundance in the 1960s and 1970s, hatchery numbers and production increased in the 1970s, and
hatcheries have released more than 400 million juvenile salnmon since the 1990s (cite Stopha, M.
2016. Alaska Fisheries Enhancement Report 2015. Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Division
of Commercial Fisheries, Regional Information Report 5J16-03. 82 pp.).
Page 11 lines 49-50: Suggest adding to end of sentence: "...feeding observations."
Page 14, line 28: Coho salmon and Chinook salmon do school in marine environments as
juveniles and adults, albeit in smaller, less dense aggregations than pinks, chums, and sockeye
due to their agnostic behavior. Suggest you say: "...school as densely as pink, chum, or sockeye
salmon juveniles."

Comments to the Author:
This is a useful observation of humpback whales feeding on hatchery fish; to my knowledge it's
the first documentation of this phenomenon, which has some interesting implications for whale-
human conflict and whale management. I agree with Referee 1 that it is a limited observation,
and perhaps more could be made of it along the lines of his comments; but it does not need to be
of broad scope to be published here, so I would recommend the authors be permitted to revise
and resubmit.
I don't think both the second and third photos are required for this; one would suffice. These
photos do make me wonder whether it's worth it for whales to feed on these salmon if they're
capturing only a few per lunge.
While mention of possible mitigation strategies would be useful, I don't believe the authors need
to devote a lot of space to this - it's not the point of the paper.

Royal Society Open Science
Dear Dr. Padian,
My coauthors and I are pleased to resubmit with revisions our manuscript "Humpback whales feed on
hatchery-released juvenile salmon" (RSOS-170180). This manuscript introduces to the scientific community
the observation that humpback whales feed on juvenile salmon. It relies on longitudinal data across
multiple sites and years to demonstrate the major temporal and spatial trends in humpback whale
predation on juvenile salmon as well as the whale behaviors used to capture this prey. We appreciate the
efforts of the reviewers in providing insightful comments and the opportunity to address those comments.
Here I have reprinted the feedback we have received indented in italics and our response to each
comment below. I have also listed small improvements to the original manuscript that were unsolicited.
Associate Editor's comments:
Comments to the Author:
This is a useful observation of humpback whales feeding on hatchery fish; to my knowledge it's
the first documentation of this phenomenon, which has some interesting implications for whale-

and perhaps more could be made of it along the lines of his comments; but it does not need to
be of broad scope to be published here, so I would recommend the authors be permitted to
revise and resubmit.
Author response to the Editor:
Reviewer 1 noted the narrow scope of this manuscript and specifically enumerated questions of interest
that remain unanswered. We are pleased to see interest in further aspects of this interaction as we are
analyzing data that will ultimately be prepared as subsequent manuscripts to address many of those
questions in depth. However, addressing more fine-scale ecological aspects of this interaction required a
different study design to accommodate higher precision sampling within a narrower spatial and temporal
scale. Crafting separate manuscripts for these two types of data markedly improved cohesion and clarity
and allowed for a detailed analysis of these aspects in future manuscripts. Further, presenting this stand-
alone manuscript first allows us to highlight the work of our industry collaborators who first observed this
nteraction and whose dedication to multiple years of this project has laid the foundation for subsequent
work. We are glad that you have judged our current effort suitable for publication in Royal Society Open
Science with revisions.
I don't think both the second and third photos are required for this; one would suffice. These
photos do make me wonder whether it's worth it for whales to feed on these salmon if they're
capturing only a few per lunge.
We removed the extra photographs.
While mention of possible mitigation strategies would be useful, I don't believe the authors need
to devote a lot of space to this - it's not the point of the paper.
The second to last paragraph of the discussion was revised to read: “Future studies will directly test
whether high humpback whale predation on a salmon cohort at the point of release is related to poor
marine survival of released salmon and the economic impacts of that predation to local fisheries. During
this study, hatchery staff noted many strategies for mitigation predation, primarily aimed at reducing the
density of salmon aggregations at the releases site. One of the most wide-spread methods was to release
fish slowly over time, a strategy known as a “trickle” release as opposed to a more traditional “mass”
release. Hatchery-staff also tried releasing fish at night, on an outgoing tide, or in a less sheltered
ocation. The most intensive strategy employed by NSRAA was to release salmon at a larger size so that
they will move from the littoral habitat more quickly [21]. A longitudinal study in space and time will be
necessary to isolate the effects of these strategies on marine survival. Future studies should also
characterize the prey field at release sites to determine the prey quality associated with foraging at
hatchery release sites.”

This has been added
Page 9: lines 22-23: Hatcheries have operated in Southeast Alaska since the late 19th century (cite
Roppel, P. 1982. Alaska Salmon hatcheries, 1891-1959. Alaska Pacific University Press, Anchorage.
299 pp.). Perhaps restate: "Salmon hatcheries have operated sporadically in Southeast Alaska since

These very useful references have been added.
Page 11 lines 49-50: Suggest adding to end of sentence: "...feeding observations."
We revised this sentence for clarity: “Humpback whales were reported to be targeting releases of chinook,
chum and coho salmon. For each of these three species, whales were observed feeding when no other
species had been released from that site.”
Page 14, line 28: Coho salmon and Chinook salmon do school in marine environments as
juveniles and adults, albeit in smaller, less dense aggregations than pinks, chums, and sockeye due
to their agnostic behavior. Suggest you say: "...school as densely as pink, chum, or sockeye salmon
juveniles."
We have revised this statement accordingly.
Other minor revisions with line numbers corresponding to originally submitted document:
Page 12 line 11/12: replaced the word “used” with the word “noted”
Page 12 line 39: revised “during observation periods” to “during scheduled observation periods”
Page 12 line 42: revised “at other times” to “opportunistically” to match the wording of the methods
Page 12 line 49: replaced a comma separating “site” and “observation duration” with “and”
Page 13 line 39-41: replaced “and… only” with “but only”
Page 13: line 54-57: replaced “because it is later in their spring migration” with “following their spring
migration”
Reference section: In addition to small formatting changes, two in-text citations were corrected for
formatting. We also added three references, one which failed to appear in the references section of the
originally submitted document and two which were added at the request of Reviewer 2.
Thank you for your continued consideration. Please let me know if you have any more questions.
