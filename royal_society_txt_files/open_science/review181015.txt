This manuscript report the synthesis, separation, characterization of three endohedral fullerenes
derivatives Gd@C74(CF3) (I), Gd@C74(CF3)(II) and Gd@C74(CF3)3. Their chemical structures
were determined by X-ray crystal structure analysis as well. This manuscript might be suitable to
publish in RSC Advance if authors are willing to address the following concerns:
1. Please use schematic figure to demonstrate the separation of endohedral metallofullerenes
from raw soot and empty cage fullerenes.
2. Please include the HPLC traces to demonstrate the separation process and purity of the sample.
3. It is interesting to see any functionalization work for these three endohedral metallofullerenes?

The authors have prepared a method and validation of metallofullerene purification. The work is
generally well carried out, and the experimental results are clear. I recommend publication of the
article and have no significant concerns.

Dear Dr Ewels:
Title: Isolation and Structure Determination of Missing Fullerenes Gd@C74(CF3)n through in-situ
Trifluoromethylation
Manuscript ID: RSOS-181015
Thank you for submitting the above manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. On behalf of the
Editors and the Royal Society of Chemistry, I am pleased to inform you that your manuscript will
be accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance
with the referee suggestions. Please find the reviewers' comments at the end of this email.
The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript before 09-Aug-2018. Please note that the revision
deadline will expire at 00.00am on this date. If you do not think you will be able to meet this date
please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
4
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Professor Eva Hevia
Associate Editor; Royal Society Open Science
Dear Prof. Hevia,
Thank you very much for your email with regard to our manuscript
label_version_2
RSOS-181015. First of all, we would like to express our great appreciation for
providing us constructive comments. Followings are our responses to the
comments. We also uploaded the doc files of the revised manuscript and the
supplementary with changes highlighted in yellow lines.
1. Comment 1 and 2 (Reviewer #1):
Please use schematic figure to demonstrate the separation of endohedral
metallofullerenes from raw soot and empty cage fullerenes.
Please include the HPLC traces to demonstrate the separation process and
purity of the sample.
Response: Thanks for the reviewers reminding. According to the
reviewers comment, we have added the overall separation scheme (Figure
S2) and HPLC profiles of purified Gd@C74 derivatives (Figures S8-10) in
Supplementary Information. The corresponding texts have also been added
in section 3.3 of the revised manuscript.
2. Comment 3 (Reviewer #1)
It is interesting to see any functionalization work for these three
endohedral metallofullerenes?
Response: Adding to mono-adducts of Gd@C74, tri-functionalized
C74-based metallofullerene was isolated for the first time. X-ray crystal
structure analysis revealed CF3 groups were selectively attached to carbon
atoms on three pentagons of the D3h-symmetry cages. Density functional
