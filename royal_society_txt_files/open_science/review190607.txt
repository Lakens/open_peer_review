Comments to the Author
This work uses computational modeling to estimate the effects of the
glycocalyx on the forces exerted by blood flow on the endothelial cells lining
a bifurcation in the carotid artery. The manuscript describes a multiscale
approach that allows consideration of flow over the time scale of the cardiac
cycle while examining forces spatially at the nanometer level. Estimates of
forces at the cell membrane are provided, and interesting differences are
reported between the patterns of forces exerted by blood on the glycocalyx
and the patterns transmitted to the cell membrane by the glycocalyx. Taken
at face value, these calculations offer novel insight into the cell/molecular
mechanisms that might be involved in endothelial responses to blood flow.
First of all, we would like to thank you for the positive comments and criticism to
our work, which will increase its quality.
One major concern is that the analysis calculates the forces exerted by
blood on the glycocalyx using macro-scale data and jumps directly to the
nanometer scale for modeling transmission to the membrane without
consideration of the intermediate, micrometer-scale structure of the vessel’s
surface. The surface is not flat; it has considerable bulges into the lumen due
to the greater thickness of each endothelial cell around its nucleus. This is
likely to have considerable impact on both the magnitude and direction of
force vectors experienced by the glycocalyx, which is of particular concern
when the force transmission to the cell membrane is being modeled on the
nanometer scale. This issue should be addressed.
Thank you for the comment. We agree with the reviewer. We calculated the forces
exerted by blood on the glycocalyx using macroscale data, jumping into the
nanometer scale for modeling transmission to the membrane. The surface of the
artery is not flat due to the thickness of the endothelial cell around its nucleus.
However, we have not considered the intermediate scale of the artery’s surface
and we based our results in the fluid forces exerted on the most exposed, upper
side of the EC. The cell shape and the interactions between constituents of the
glycocalyx may have an impact on both the magnitude and direction of force
vectors experienced by the glycocalyx. A multi-scale approach to go across this
wide range of length scales is out of the scope of this study. Note that we are
solving the problem, even if using an idealized model of mechanotransduction, in
every node of the computational mesh of ~37000 nodes. Here our intent was
provocative: can we demonstrate, even if with an idealized/simplified approach,
that the paradigm of computational hemodynamics, widely applied to identify
regions of disturbed shear at the luminal surface of arterial segments, is adequate
to describe the hemodynamic risk of vascular disease? Could we have a different
pattern of atherosclerotic risk at the arterial wall, considering that near wall
hemodynamic forces are not transmitted as they are to the endothelial cells? The
simplified approach adopted in this study allowed us to address this questions in a
large range of conditions, highlighting the differences in the response of the GCX
to the wide variety of hemodynamic stimuli in a realistic geometry.
To compute the shape effect of the cell, we should now develop a multiscale
method in with every node would correspond with the position of a cell, and do a
new simulation in this new domain, which would increase considerably the
computational time. Here, we focused on macroscopic quantities at the artery
scale. We consider the most exposed section of the cell, on top of the dome, which
are the section more exposed to the fluid forces. We have also included references
of numerical studies that have looked at this aspect in one single cell (reference 14
and 30 in the revised manuscript). We believe that these references will
complement our contribution with an intermediate scale perspective. We have
added a discussion about this point in the discussion of the manuscript,
highlighted in blue in the revised manuscript
Additional points needing clarification:
In Figures 1, 3 and 4, do the white regions on the arteries represent no data
being displayed or do they indicate that the values are above or below the
color scale? White regions are seen on both sides of some of the isolines in
figures 3 and 4, suggesting that white represents a calculated value, but the
uniform white around the bifurcation apex in most of the figures suggests
that data is simply not being displayed. The boundaries of the data
representation in these images should be clarified, perhaps with a different
color or pattern if there are regions that are included to show the geometry
but do not have force values.
Thank you for pointing this out. We apologize for not being more precise in the
first place. White regions have out of scale values, as white is one limit of the color
scale. We have modified the figure captions to describe what white regions
represent in each figure.
The sentence on p. 6, lines 8-10, describing the coordinate system appears
to give 2 conflicting definitions of the vector, <U+03B6>. Should the second definition
be referring to the vector <U+03B7>?
Yes, this is a typo. We have corrected it in the current version of the manuscript.
The paper's title is grammatically confusing. Is mechanotransduction really
“of the endothelial glycocalyx” and “to the hemodynamic shear forces”? Is the
intended meaning "mechanotrasnduction of hemodynamic forces by
endothelial glycocalyx"?
Thank you for the suggestion. We have rephrased the title as suggested.

Comments to the Author
This submitted manuscript seeks to understand better the magnitude that
blood flow induced shear forces are transmitted to the endothelial cell
transmembrane structures via the glycocalyx. Utilizing predicted temporal
hemodynamic profiles derived from image-based modeling of a human
carotid bifurcation, the Authors utilize Timoshenko beam theory to quantify
the transmission of shearing forces from the tip to the base of generalized
cylindrical beams (continuum model), which are representative of the
heparan sulfate structures in the glycocalyx. Evaluated metrics include force
transduced to the cellular membrane, ratio of applied (fluid shearing) to
transduced force, spectral power ratio (frequency domain quantity),
oscillatory force index (OFI), and the similarity index between varying
magnitudes of OFI and oscillatory shear index (OSI) regions. Results
demonstrate a large difference between computed near-wall hemodynamic
metrics and value transmitted to the cellular surface. Furthermore,
differences in the degree of temporal oscillation are observed between near-
wall shearing stresses and transmitted forces. Thus, the Authors conclude
that the glycocalyx not only dampens the magnitude of forces that are
actually transmitted to the cellular surface, but may alter the (temporal)
shear patterns transmitted.
We thank the reviewer for the constructive criticism and for the time spent in
improving our work.
The Authors present an interesting study with intriguing findings; however,
there are concerns that the continuum model is oversimplified in both is
geometry and interaction with surrounding structures. Specific comments
include:
1. The computational geometry seems extremely simplified, as compared to
the native structure of the glycocalyx. The glycocalyx is a complex structure,
with a heterogeneous distribution of membrane bound proteoglycans and
glycoproteins. This manuscript only includes a single protein, heparan
sulfate, and utilized a generalized geometry for its structure that differs
tremendously from the true form. While molecular dynamic simulations lack
the ability to examine the time over a cardiac cycle, these simulations offer
greater physical representation of these microstructures. For example, Jiang
et al. (ref. 29) observed significant interactions between constituents of the
glycocalyx that impact resulting shear stress profiles. The inherent
assumptions in this manuscript limit the enthusiasm and confidence in the
presented results.
We agree with the reviewer’s point of view. The approach proposed here is based
upon a simplistic description of the GCX that could only partially capture the
complexity of the transmission of fluid forces to the endothelium.
However, the proposed approach has allowed having a snapshot of plausible
mechanotrasduction patterns throughout the whole carotid bifurcation with a
moderate computational effort, by exploring a wide range of hemodynamic WSS
profiles. More accurate GCX modeling, e.g., based on full atomistic molecular
dynamics simulations coupled with CFD, would be more appropriate for
addressing a mechanistic description of the phenomenon at the single molecule
scale. However, it is not possible, as the reviewer points out, to get information
along the entire cardiac cycle due to time-scale limitations. Even coarse grained
modelling is not a viable solution, as computing all possible hemodynamic fluid
patterns, as we have done here for the simplified model, would be extremely
computationally and time-expensive.
Despite the aforementioned limitations, the provocative intent and findings of the
present in silico study warrant future investigations focusing on the actual forces
transmitted to the transmembrane mechanotrasductors, which might outperform
hemodynamic descriptors of disturbed shear as localizing factors of vascular
disease. We believe that these findings are meaningful and could open new
investigation in this direction. We have added these arguments in the Discussion
section of the revised version of the manuscript.
2. The results presented in Section 3.2 further strengthen the argument that
the continuum assumption is not ideal for this problem. When considering
similar beam dimensions and stiffness values, variations in beam deflections
are observed. What is the reasoning behind this difference, and how does it
affect the subsequent? Understanding this discrepancy is key for confidence
in follow-up studies.
We use EI= 68 KPa, 100 KPa, 490kPa and 700 KPa. Then we also varied the
diameter of the structure. In all of them we got different deflection values. As a
consequence, the dimension parameters are different and thus different
deflections are, of course, obtained.
The goal of that part of the study was to consider some length dimension that are
know from experimental results (HS of 50 nm in length) and predict the other
parameters, resulting in a structure of 1nm in diameter and EI=100 KPa. This
combination of parameter that better reproduced the geometrical features and
deflection results reported in [12, 30].
