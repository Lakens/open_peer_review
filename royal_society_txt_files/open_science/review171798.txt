The authors conducted a study in the banded mongoose investigating the effect of
familiarity and degree of genetic relatedness on responses to odours of scent marks and found
differential responses based on relatedness within their familiar social group and based on
familiarity with the odour donor across social groups. They present a large dataset that provides
interesting insights into how the banded mongoose uses information in conspecific scent marks
to guide their behaviour. Their conclusions, however, are based on an outdated view of kin
recognition mechanisms, but the results fit nicely with the newer concepts so they should be able
to revise the manuscript accordingly into a strong paper.
The kin recognition literature covers such a broad range of species that it is challenging
to keep up with the full spectrum of studies (I confess that I never met this challenge successfully)
and it is not always clear which papers present new theoretical concepts and which are just
presenting new evidence so it is easy to miss theoretical advances. In the datasets that Giora Heth
and I have collected with various collaborators and various, mostly wild, rodent species over the
years, we stumbled onto some findings that demanded new ways of interpreting discriminative
odour-guided behaviour (see Todrank & Heth, Advances in the Study of Behavior 2003). In a
nutshell, individual odours of more closely related individuals are perceived and treated as
similar compared with those of less closely related individuals and this enables individuals to
assess their degree of genetic relatedness to other individuals (or individual odours) they
encounter by comparing the degree of similarity between the other individual’s odour and their
own. This process is facilitated by the olfactory epithelium being tuned through odour exposure
to maximize such comparisons (see Todrank et al. Proc. Royal Soc. London B 2011). This helps
clarify that familiarity is not a mechanism for recognising kinship, although familiarity provides
an opportunity to assess genetic relatedness and associate degrees of relatedness to specific
individuals encountered. It is also now clear that the assessment done is not with a learned
template quite as hypothesized in phenotype matching but through the physiology of the odour
perception itself. In addition to strengthening the conceptual basis of the revised manuscript,
understanding the methodology presented in the Todrank & Heth (2003) review offers ways of
testing the questions the authors raised in the conclusion of the paper that are clearly suitable for
the banded mongoose.
Some specific suggestions:
P 1, l 30: “higher rates” is not clear when the responses have not yet been described.
P 1, l 38: individual odours do not get scrambled when unrelated individuals are living in social
groups; the genetic identity and relatedness cues remain even after the individual becomes
familiar.
P 1, l 51-52: alternative mechanisms of inbreeding avoidance do not evolve over and over during
speciation but which mechanisms are used may vary depending on the habitat and social
structure.
P 2, l 5: this is not actually a kin recognition mechanism but a means of identifying and
remembering caregivers.
P 2, l 7: “simple rules” is not clear.
P 2, l 30-31: “they may also be used through learning the scent of familiar individuals” is not
clear. The genetic identity is a vital part of what is learned in the process of becoming familiar!
P 2, l 45: “kin discrimination does not appear to occur at the pup stage” – but this is something
that must be tested because appearances cannot reveal whether pups are treated as generic pups
without the observer attending to genetic identity information or whether specific pups are
3
recognized individually but treated the same irrespective of genetic relatedness.
P 2, l 47: “violent evictions” should be defined for readers who are unfamiliar with this particular
species.
P 3, l 4-5: “individuals do not appear to recognise their own pups or parents” – but recognition is
only evident when there are discriminative responses so it would be more accurate to say, if this
is the observation, that adults treat their own and other parents’ pups the same and pups treat
other adults the same as their parents. Note that showing discriminative behaviour also
demonstrates ability to discriminate but failing to show discriminative behaviour does not
indicate inability to distinguish!
P 3, l 20-21: “if they use familiarity or simple rules that require familiarity, they may only be able
to distinguish the relatedness of familiar individuals” – it is important to remember that a
dominant aspect of becoming familiar is learning about the individual’s identity, which includes
genotypic information in the phenotype, so it would only be accurate to say that they don’t
distinguish not that they can’t.
P 3, l 59: the term “observer” would be preferable to “recipient” (and in the Tables “odour donor
sex” would be preferable to “odour sex” – or if it has to be shorter “donor sex”).
P 3, l 60: this paradigm does not test their “ability”.
P 4, l 21: 30 cm seems like a long way from the odour source.
P 4, l 51: “whether relatedness was detected using scent” – this design can only demonstrate
whether the behaviour in response to the scent is affected by relatedness not whether the
relatedness is detected.
P 4, l 58-P5, l 2: this is a serious familiarity-relatedness confound! (But after reading the results,
that they respond differentially based on relatedness within the familiar group demonstrates the
discrimination based on relatedness even if it is not evident within the unfamiliar group.)
P 5, l 24: “alter their response” – it would be better to say “respond differentially”
P 5, l 25: “toward odours – insert – they were more related to” – add “from donors”
P 5, l 31-32: “whilst older odours received” – change to “whilst odours from older donors
elicited”
P 5, l 38: “impacted” should be changed to “affected” or “influenced”.
P 5, l 39: “…familiarity of the odour” – add donor.
P 5, l 43: “…as strong a discrimination” – change discrimination to “discriminative
response”.
P 5, l 48: “impacted” should be changed to “affected” or “influenced”.
P 5, l 55-56: “reduced the amount of” should be changed to “spent less”.
P 6, l 11: “identifying kin through familiarity” – in cooperative breeders familiarity in
and of itself is not sufficient for discriminating kinship or degrees of relatedness. Treating
familiar conspecifics differently from unfamiliar is orthogonal to treating closer relatives
differently from less genetically similar (closely related) conspecifics. Familiarity does involve
learning about the specific identifying characteristics that enable distinguishing one individual
from another thus when two individuals interact for the first time, each would evaluate their
degree of genetic relatedness to the other as part of their assessment and coding process that
enables identification of the other individual as familiar in subsequent encounters – just as they
would evaluate other trait- (e.g. sex) and state- (e.g. reproductive status, health) dependent
characteristics. Any concept of familiarity (becoming familiar) must include some level of genetic
relatedness assessment. Familiarity enables distinguishing among known individual kin (which
technically is not “kin recognition”) and between the group of known kin and the group of
unknown kin – which also is not technically “kin recognition” because recognition of the degree
of relatedness is not part of the discrimination of familiar individuals from unfamiliar
individuals.
P 6, l 21-23: “When presenting unfamiliar odours to banded mongooses, we found no evidence
that individuals differ in their responses to odours based on relatedness. This suggests that this
species does not use a mechanism to assess the genetic relatedness of unfamiliar individuals
directly.” Not responding differently in this experimental paradigm to odours of unfamiliar
4
differentially related conspecifics does not indicate that the subjects were unable to distinguish
between those odours based on the degree of relatedness to them and it certainly does not
suggest that they would not use genetic relatedness information in coding the information about
those individual odour donors should the subject encounter the donors themselves. There has
been a lot of progress in understanding recognition mechanisms since Paul Sherman’s work in
the 1980s. As mentioned above, Giora Heth’s and my paper in Advances in the Study of Behavior
(2003) reviews evidence from multiple rodent species that indicates a process of genetic
relatedness assessment across a broad continuum that relies on widespread findings that
individual odours of more closely related individuals are perceptually similar compared with
those of less closely related individuals. This process is quite different from phenotype matching
in the sense that Sherman hypothesized. We also found (see Todrank et al Proceedings of the
Royal Society B, 2011) that the olfactory epithelium is tuned through exposure (even from
gestation) to enhance sensitivity to odours similar to the individual’s own odour, thus providing
a physiological basis for the behavioural mechanism. This section should be rewritten based on
the current understanding.
P 6, l 21-23: It is important to distinguish between what an animal is able to do and what it
actually does. When mating is mostly within the own social group there may be no benefit of
acting on the distinctions but this is different from not being able to make those distinctions.
(After reading further in the discussion, it sounds like there is evidence suggesting that
relatedness plays a role in avoiding inbreeding within the social group.) It may be that, in
addition to the small number of relatives in the unfamiliar group, the protocol that was used for
this study was not suited to demonstrating abilities. Thus it would be accurate to say that
distinctions based on relatedness were not demonstrated rather than that the banded mongoose
does not have the ability to make such distinctions.
P 6, l 46-48: “As a response to relatedness occurs with familiar, but not unfamiliar individuals,
this raises the possibility that banded mongooses are using a learned cue to identify relatives
from their own group.” The response based on relatedness in the familiar group shows the ability
and the behaviour based on that ability thus they must be able to make such distinctions as
unfamiliar individuals are encountered and thus become familiar. What they are learning in this
process is not a cue to identify relatives in general but associating the particular relatedness
characteristics identified with the individual bearing those characteristics. Parentage is not
scrambled because of birth synchrony because the parentage is evident in the individual odours
of their offspring. The evidence presented indicates that banded mongoose can and do make
genetic relatedness discriminations within their groups.
P 7, l 34-35: “It is unlikely that scent presentation experiments would be able further to
determine whether phenotype-matching is used to identify relatives from within the group.” It is
very likely that scent presentation experiments designed for the purpose (without the necessity of
GCMS) would demonstrate genetic relatedness assessment abilities both within and across
groups whether those abilities are affect their behavioural responses or not.
The clear differences in responses of males and females could surely be explained by the social
patterns of the species. I am not familiar with the banded mongoose so I would not want to make
a suggestion about this. But I am confident that the authors will be able to come up with a
plausible explanation after re-thinking the results in terms of the new way of looking at
familiarity and genetic relatedness assessment as Todrank and Heth (2003) describe.
I would be happy to help in any way I can as you proceed with the revision.

label_comment_2
The manuscript deals on the mechanism underlying kin recognition in a cooperative breeding
mammal, where inbreeding is typically rather high. This is an interesting topic and the
manuscript is well written, results clearly presented. The discussion, based on the results, which
are not fully always straight forward, is on few places too speculative and needs some
elaboration. See my specific comment to add some additional information on your argument.
P5, L31: Specify here ‘..whilst odours of older individuals…’ rather than only ‘…whilst older
odours..’. At least I assume the discrimination is not due to the age of the odour sample, but due
to the ager of the odour donor?
I also wonder about this result. You do not discuss it? What explains such an age effect? See also
comment P7, L19 further down.
P6, L21-L42: Could the lack of discrimination of relatedness in unfamiliar samples not simple be
explained that all of these donors are much less related to the recipient. Therefore, to expect a
discrimination based on relatedness at the level of mainly <0.125 in unfamiliar groups versus the
very high relatedness ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 in the familiar groups would not be surprising. I
suggest to at least discuss this more obvious. Even though sample size would be very small, if
you only compared the same relatedness levels in familiar and non-familiar groups, would you
still get a significant discrimination in the familiar groups? Or would potentially in the unfamiliar
groups a potential trend for discrimination of relatedness come up?
P6, L59: Typing error? ‘…has appears…’?
P7, L19-L21: However, you did find an age effect in several of the analysis. Even though currently
you may not have founder individuals in there, any of the first offspring generation would still
have been the opportunity to distinguish the founders as their potential parents and their cohort
as closely related in comparison to any of the next litters, if I understand the system correctly.
Were there still 1st generation offspring in your groups? Maybe this could explain your findings
on age effects in the responses to the samples.
P7, L50-L52: Although this is an interesting suggestion, please can you reason why this could be
the case. As it is, or from the manuscript it is not immediately obvious why this should be
expected? Otherwise, it is left too much of a pure speculation.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors conducted a study in the banded mongoose investigating the effect of
familiarity and degree of genetic relatedness on responses to odours of scent marks and found
differential responses based on relatedness within their familiar social group and based on
familiarity with the odour donor across social groups. They present a large dataset that provides
interesting insights into how the banded mongoose uses information in conspecific scent marks
to guide their behaviour. Their conclusions, however, are based on an outdated view of kin
recognition mechanisms, but the results fit nicely with the newer concepts so they should be able
to revise the manuscript accordingly into a strong paper.
The kin recognition literature covers such a broad range of species that it is challenging
to keep up with the full spectrum of studies (I confess that I never met this challenge successfully)
and it is not always clear which papers present new theoretical concepts and which are just
presenting new evidence so it is easy to miss theoretical advances. In the datasets that Giora Heth
and I have collected with various collaborators and various, mostly wild, rodent species over the
years, we stumbled onto some findings that demanded new ways of interpreting discriminative
odour-guided behaviour (see Todrank & Heth, Advances in the Study of Behavior 2003). In a
nutshell, individual odours of more closely related individuals are perceived and treated as
similar compared with those of less closely related individuals and this enables individuals to
assess their degree of genetic relatedness to other individuals (or individual odours) they
encounter by comparing the degree of similarity between the other individual’s odour and their
own. This process is facilitated by the olfactory epithelium being tuned through odour exposure
to maximize such comparisons (see Todrank et al. Proc. Royal Soc. London B 2011). This helps
clarify that familiarity is not a mechanism for recognising kinship, although familiarity provides
an opportunity to assess genetic relatedness and associate degrees of relatedness to specific
individuals encountered. It is also now clear that the assessment done is not with a learned
template quite as hypothesized in phenotype matching but through the physiology of the odour
perception itself. In addition to strengthening the conceptual basis of the revised manuscript,
understanding the methodology presented in the Todrank & Heth (2003) review offers ways of
testing the questions the authors raised in the conclusion of the paper that are clearly suitable for
the banded mongoose.
Some specific suggestions:
P 1, l 30: “higher rates” is not clear when the responses have not yet been described.
P 1, l 38: individual odours do not get scrambled when unrelated individuals are living in social
groups; the genetic identity and relatedness cues remain even after the individual becomes
familiar.
9
P 1, l 51-52: alternative mechanisms of inbreeding avoidance do not evolve over and over during
speciation but which mechanisms are used may vary depending on the habitat and social
structure.
P 2, l 5: this is not actually a kin recognition mechanism but a means of identifying and
remembering caregivers.
P 2, l 7: “simple rules” is not clear.
P 2, l 30-31: “they may also be used through learning the scent of familiar individuals” is not
clear. The genetic identity is a vital part of what is learned in the process of becoming familiar!
P 2, l 45: “kin discrimination does not appear to occur at the pup stage” – but this is something
that must be tested because appearances cannot reveal whether pups are treated as generic pups
without the observer attending to genetic identity information or whether specific pups are
recognized individually but treated the same irrespective of genetic relatedness.
P 2, l 47: “violent evictions” should be defined for readers who are unfamiliar with this particular
species.
P 3, l 4-5: “individuals do not appear to recognise their own pups or parents” – but recognition is
only evident when there are discriminative responses so it would be more accurate to say, if this
is the observation, that adults treat their own and other parents’ pups the same and pups treat
other adults the same as their parents. Note that showing discriminative behaviour also
demonstrates ability to discriminate but failing to show discriminative behaviour does not
indicate inability to distinguish!
P 3, l 20-21: “if they use familiarity or simple rules that require familiarity, they may only be able
to distinguish the relatedness of familiar individuals” – it is important to remember that a
dominant aspect of becoming familiar is learning about the individual’s identity, which includes
genotypic information in the phenotype, so it would only be accurate to say that they don’t
distinguish not that they can’t.
P 3, l 59: the term “observer” would be preferable to “recipient” (and in the Tables “odour donor
sex” would be preferable to “odour sex” – or if it has to be shorter “donor sex”).
P 3, l 60: this paradigm does not test their “ability”.
P 4, l 21: 30 cm seems like a long way from the odour source.
P 4, l 51: “whether relatedness was detected using scent” – this design can only demonstrate
whether the behaviour in response to the scent is affected by relatedness not whether the
relatedness is detected.
P 4, l 58-P5, l 2: this is a serious familiarity-relatedness confound! (But after reading the results,
that they respond differentially based on relatedness within the familiar group demonstrates the
discrimination based on relatedness even if it is not evident within the unfamiliar group.)
P 5, l 24: “alter their response” – it would be better to say “respond differentially”
P 5, l 25: “toward odours – insert – they were more related to” – add “from donors”
P 5, l 31-32: “whilst older odours received” – change to “whilst odours from older donors
elicited”
P 5, l 38: “impacted” should be changed to “affected” or “influenced”.
P 5, l 39: “…familiarity of the odour” – add donor.
P 5, l 43: “…as strong a discrimination” – change discrimination to “discriminative
response”.
P 5, l 48: “impacted” should be changed to “affected” or “influenced”.
P 5, l 55-56: “reduced the amount of” should be changed to “spent less”.
P 6, l 11: “identifying kin through familiarity” – in cooperative breeders familiarity in
and of itself is not sufficient for discriminating kinship or degrees of relatedness. Treating
familiar conspecifics differently from unfamiliar is orthogonal to treating closer relatives
differently from less genetically similar (closely related) conspecifics. Familiarity does involve
learning about the specific identifying characteristics that enable distinguishing one individual
from another thus when two individuals interact for the first time, each would evaluate their
degree of genetic relatedness to the other as part of their assessment and coding process that
enables identification of the other individual as familiar in subsequent encounters – just as they
10
would evaluate other trait- (e.g. sex) and state- (e.g. reproductive status, health) dependent
characteristics. Any concept of familiarity (becoming familiar) must include some level of genetic
relatedness assessment. Familiarity enables distinguishing among known individual kin (which
technically is not “kin recognition”) and between the group of known kin and the group of
unknown kin – which also is not technically “kin recognition” because recognition of the degree
of relatedness is not part of the discrimination of familiar individuals from unfamiliar
individuals.
P 6, l 21-23: “When presenting unfamiliar odours to banded mongooses, we found no evidence
that individuals differ in their responses to odours based on relatedness. This suggests that this
species does not use a mechanism to assess the genetic relatedness of unfamiliar individuals
directly.” Not responding differently in this experimental paradigm to odours of unfamiliar
differentially related conspecifics does not indicate that the subjects were unable to distinguish
between those odours based on the degree of relatedness to them and it certainly does not
suggest that they would not use genetic relatedness information in coding the information about
those individual odour donors should the subject encounter the donors themselves. There has
been a lot of progress in understanding recognition mechanisms since Paul Sherman’s work in
the 1980s. As mentioned above, Giora Heth’s and my paper in Advances in the Study of Behavior
(2003) reviews evidence from multiple rodent species that indicates a process of genetic
relatedness assessment across a broad continuum that relies on widespread findings that
individual odours of more closely related individuals are perceptually similar compared with
those of less closely related individuals. This process is quite different from phenotype matching
in the sense that Sherman hypothesized. We also found (see Todrank et al Proceedings of the
Royal Society B, 2011) that the olfactory epithelium is tuned through exposure (even from
gestation) to enhance sensitivity to odours similar to the individual’s own odour, thus providing
a physiological basis for the behavioural mechanism. This section should be rewritten based on
the current understanding.
P 6, l 21-23: It is important to distinguish between what an animal is able to do and what it
actually does. When mating is mostly within the own social group there may be no benefit of
acting on the distinctions but this is different from not being able to make those distinctions.
(After reading further in the discussion, it sounds like there is evidence suggesting that
relatedness plays a role in avoiding inbreeding within the social group.) It may be that, in
addition to the small number of relatives in the unfamiliar group, the protocol that was used for
this study was not suited to demonstrating abilities. Thus it would be accurate to say that
distinctions based on relatedness were not demonstrated rather than that the banded mongoose
does not have the ability to make such distinctions.
P 6, l 46-48: “As a response to relatedness occurs with familiar, but not unfamiliar individuals,
this raises the possibility that banded mongooses are using a learned cue to identify relatives
from their own group.” The response based on relatedness in the familiar group shows the ability
and the behaviour based on that ability thus they must be able to make such distinctions as
unfamiliar individuals are encountered and thus become familiar. What they are learning in this
process is not a cue to identify relatives in general but associating the particular relatedness
characteristics identified with the individual bearing those characteristics. Parentage is not
scrambled because of birth synchrony because the parentage is evident in the individual odours
of their offspring. The evidence presented indicates that banded mongoose can and do make
genetic relatedness discriminations within their groups.
P 7, l 34-35: “It is unlikely that scent presentation experiments would be able further to
determine whether phenotype-matching is used to identify relatives from within the group.” It is
very likely that scent presentation experiments designed for the purpose (without the necessity of
GCMS) would demonstrate genetic relatedness assessment abilities both within and across
groups whether those abilities are affect their behavioural responses or not.
The clear differences in responses of males and females could surely be explained by the social
patterns of the species. I am not familiar with the banded mongoose so I would not want to make
a suggestion about this. But I am confident that the authors will be able to come up with a
11
plausible explanation after re-thinking the results in terms of the new way of looking at
familiarity and genetic relatedness assessment as Todrank and Heth (2003) describe.
I would be happy to help in any way I can as you proceed with the revision.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript deals on the mechanism underlying kin recognition in a cooperative breeding
mammal, where inbreeding is typically rather high. This is an interesting topic and the
manuscript is well written, results clearly presented. The discussion, based on the results, which
are not fully always straight forward, is on few places too speculative and needs some
elaboration. See my specific comment to add some additional information on your argument.
P5, L31: Specify here ‘..whilst odours of older individuals…’ rather than only ‘…whilst older
odours..’. At least I assume the discrimination is not due to the age of the odour sample, but due
to the ager of the odour donor?
I also wonder about this result. You do not discuss it? What explains such an age effect? See also
comment P7, L19 further down.
P6, L21-L42: Could the lack of discrimination of relatedness in unfamiliar samples not simple be
explained that all of these donors are much less related to the recipient. Therefore, to expect a
discrimination based on relatedness at the level of mainly <0.125 in unfamiliar groups versus the
very high relatedness ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 in the familiar groups would not be surprising. I
suggest to at least discuss this more obvious. Even though sample size would be very small, if
you only compared the same relatedness levels in familiar and non-familiar groups, would you
still get a significant discrimination in the familiar groups? Or would potentially in the unfamiliar
groups a potential trend for discrimination of relatedness come up?
P6, L59: Typing error? ‘…has appears…’?
P7, L19-L21: However, you did find an age effect in several of the analysis. Even though currently
you may not have founder individuals in there, any of the first offspring generation would still
have been the opportunity to distinguish the founders as their potential parents and their cohort
as closely related in comparison to any of the next litters, if I understand the system correctly.
Were there still 1st generation offspring in your groups? Maybe this could explain your findings
on age effects in the responses to the samples.
P7, L50-L52: Although this is an interesting suggestion, please can you reason why this could be
the case. As it is, or from the manuscript it is not immediately obvious why this should be
expected? Otherwise, it is left too much of a pure speculation.

‘odour sex’ or ‘odour age’. It would be ok for ‘odour sex’, but ‘odour age’ could mean

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors conducted a study in the banded mongoose investigating the effect of familiarity
and degree of genetic relatedness on responses to odours of scent marks and found differential
responses based on relatedness within their familiar social group and based on familiarity with the
odour donor across social groups. They present a large dataset that provides interesting insights into
how the banded mongoose uses information in conspecific scent marks to guide their behaviour.
Their conclusions, however, are based on an outdated view of kin recognition mechanisms, but the
results fit nicely with the newer concepts so they should be able to revise the manuscript accordingly
into a strong paper.
The kin recognition literature covers such a broad range of species that it is challenging to keep
up with the full spectrum of studies (I confess that I never met this challenge successfully) and it is
not always clear which papers present new theoretical concepts and which are just presenting new
evidence so it is easy to miss theoretical advances. In the datasets that Giora Heth and I have
collected with various collaborators and various, mostly wild, rodent species over the years, we
stumbled onto some findings that demanded new ways of interpreting discriminative odour-guided
behaviour (see Todrank & Heth, Advances in the Study of Behavior 2003). In a nutshell, individual
odours of more closely related individuals are perceived and treated as similar compared with those
of less closely related individuals and this enables individuals to assess their degree of genetic
relatedness to other individuals (or individual odours) they encounter by comparing the degree of
similarity between the other individual’s odour and their own. This process is facilitated by the
olfactory epithelium being tuned through odour exposure to maximize such comparisons (see
Todrank et al. Proc. Royal Soc. London B 2011). This helps clarify that familiarity is not a mechanism
for recognising kinship, although familiarity provides an opportunity to assess genetic relatedness
and associate degrees of relatedness to specific individuals encountered. It is also now clear that the
assessment done is not with a learned template quite as hypothesized in phenotype matching but
through the physiology of the odour perception itself. In addition to strengthening the conceptual
basis of the revised manuscript, understanding the methodology presented in the Todrank & Heth
(2003) review offers ways of testing the questions the authors raised in the conclusion of the paper
that are clearly suitable for the banded mongoose.
Thank you for your suggested reading/updates. We have incorporated these papers into the
manuscript where appropriate and have made substantial changes to the introduction and
discussion accordingly. For example, we have replaced ‘kin recognition’ with ‘kin discrimination’
throughout the manuscript to reflect the implied cognitive process associated with the word
‘recognition’. We also recognise that relatedness is on a continuous scale and individuals are likely to
respond to it as such (rather than by responding to different categories of relatedness, or simply to
kin and non-kin) and have clarified this in the manuscript. We have also clarified our use of the term
‘familiarity’ and have better explained what we mean by ‘simple rules’ in the introduction.
Some specific suggestions:
P 1, l 30: “higher rates” is not clear when the responses have not yet been described.
“higher rates” has been replaced with “heightened behavioural response …” P1,L10
P 1, l 38: individual odours do not get scrambled when unrelated individuals are living in social
groups; the genetic identity and relatedness cues remain even after the individual becomes familiar.
We have replaced ‘scrambled’ with ‘disrupted’ here. We have also added the word ‘behavioural’ to
make it clear that we are not referring to chemical cues to relatedness here. P1,L9-10
We have also added further information into the introduction and discussion to clarify details of the
unusual system of synchronous birth and communal pup rearing that is present in this species, and
how this might make it difficult to identify the parentage of pups. P3,L6-11 and P9,L27-43
P 1, l 51-52: alternative mechanisms of inbreeding avoidance do not evolve over and over during
speciation but which mechanisms are used may vary depending on the habitat and social structure.
We have now changed this from “here, there is likely to be selection pressure to evolve alternative.
Mechanisms…” to “Thus, such species must utilise alternative mechanisms…”, which we hope
clarifies this point. P2,L3-4.
P 2, l 5: this is not actually a kin recognition mechanism but a means of identifying and remembering
caregivers.
We agree that individuals can use familiarity to identify and remember caregivers, however we do
not think that we can currently exclude the possibility that individuals in some species use
mechanisms based on familiarity as a way to assess potential relatedness. In many cooperative
breeders, caregivers are closely related to the offspring they help, and offspring direct help in later
life towards previous caregivers. This leaves it unclear whether individuals are directing help towards
relatives by directly assessing their relatedness (e.g. through phenotype matching via scent), or
through using familiarity (when juvenile) to locate likely relatives. However, cross-fostering
experiments in cooperative birds (e.g. Seychelles warblers) find that cross-fostered offspring help at
their adoptive mother’s nest as often as true offspring. It therefore seems likely that that adoptive
mother is ‘recognised’ (incorrectly) as a genetic relative. We’ve re-structured this and the following
paragraph to clarify our argument and also to try to clarify the use of the term ‘familiarity’ - as you
point out in your review, this term is used in a rather confusing way in the literature, with different
studies using it to mean rather different things! P2,L6-26.
P 2, l 7: “simple rules” is not clear.
This section has now been re-ordered and expanded. We hope that it is now clear what we mean by
‘simple’ rules’ and how these relate to familiarity. P2,L17-26
P 2, l 30-31: “they may also be used through learning the scent of familiar individuals” is not clear.
The genetic identity is a vital part of what is learned in the process of becoming familiar!
We have now changed this section to focus on the potential mechanism of kin discrimination from
Todrank et al 2010. P2,L28-34
P 2, l 45: “kin discrimination does not appear to occur at the pup stage” – but this is something that
must be tested because appearances cannot reveal whether pups are treated as generic pups
without the observer attending to genetic identity information or whether specific pups are
recognized individually but treated the same irrespective of genetic relatedness.
We have added the need for empirical testing added to text, and have also added further
information on the apparent lack of discrimination of pups based on relatedness. P3,L16
P 2, l 47: “violent evictions” should be defined for readers who are unfamiliar with this particular
species.
We have added a better definition of eviction “Here individuals threaten, chase and attack same-sex
conspecifics eventually expelling them from the group”. P3,L18-19.
P 3, l 4-5: “individuals do not appear to recognise their own pups or parents” – but recognition is
only evident when there are discriminative responses so it would be more accurate to say, if this is
the observation, that adults treat their own and other parents’ pups the same and pups treat other
adults the same as their parents. Note that showing discriminative behaviour also demonstrates
ability to discriminate but failing to show discriminative behaviour does not indicate inability to
distinguish!
Good point – we have reworded to make this clear. P3,L35-37
P 3, l 20-21: “if they use familiarity or simple rules that require familiarity, they may only be able to
distinguish the relatedness of familiar individuals” – it is important to remember that a dominant
aspect of becoming familiar is learning about the individual’s identity, which includes genotypic
information in the phenotype, so it would only be accurate to say that they don’t distinguish not that
they can’t.
We have added further discussion to make clear that our experiment can only determine whether
banded mongooses do or do not alter their response to the odour based on relatedness, rather than
whether or not they can discriminate based on relatedness. We have also clarified this point
throughout the manuscript.
P 3, l 59: the term “observer” would be preferable to “recipient” (and in the Tables “odour donor
sex” would be preferable to “odour sex” – or if it has to be shorter “donor sex”).
We have changed “odour sex” and “odour age” to “donor sex” and “donor age” in the text and
tables throughout. However, we think that changing “recipient” to “observer” may be confusing for
readers as the term “observer” is often used in the literature to mean the scientist conducting the
study (this is how the term observer is already used in this study) so we would rather leave this as
“recipient”.
P 3, l 60: this paradigm does not test their “ability”.
Good point – the wording has been updated: ‘to assess whether banded mongooses distinguish…’
P4,L44
P 4, l 21: 30 cm seems like a long way from the odour source.
We chose this value as in preliminary trials banded mongooses were seen to investigate the odour
from this distance, and all scent marking occurred with a 30cm radius. This is also less than one body
length for this species. In addition, there were no cases where individuals returned to foraging
within 30cm of the scent.
P 4, l 51: “whether relatedness was detected using scent” – this design can only demonstrate
whether the behaviour in response to the scent is affected by relatedness not whether the
relatedness is detected.
Updated in the text to ‘whether behaviour in response to the scent is affected by relatedness’. P6,L2.
P 4, l 58-P5, l 2: this is a serious familiarity-relatedness confound! (But after reading the results, that
they respond differentially based on relatedness within the familiar group demonstrates the
discrimination based on relatedness even if it is not evident within the unfamiliar group.)
We agree – this is why we went on to analyse familiar and unfamiliar odours separately. As you
point, out, an effect of relatedness on responses to odours was found within familiar individuals,
demonstrating discrimination based on relatedness.
P 5, l 24: “alter their response” – it would be better to say “respond differentially”
Changed as suggested. P6,L32
P 5, l 25: “toward odours – insert – they were more related to” – add “from donors”
Changed as suggested. P6,L33-34
P 5, l 31-32: “whilst older odours received” – change to “whilst odours from older donors elicited”
Amended in text, reviewer 1&2 wording suggestion combined. P6,L38-39.
P 5, l 38: “impacted” should be changed to “affected” or “influenced”.
Amended in text, “influenced” replaced “impacted”. P7,L1.
P 5, l 39: “…familiarity of the odour” – add donor.
Changed as suggested P7,L3.
P 5, l 43: “…as strong a discrimination” – change discrimination to “discriminative response”.
Amended in text as suggested. P7,L6
P 5, l 48: “impacted” should be changed to “affected” or “influenced”.
Amended in text, “influence” replaced “impact”. P7,L11
P 5, l 55-56: “reduced the amount of” should be changed to “spent less”.
Amended in text as suggested P7,L18
P 6, l 11: “identifying kin through familiarity” – in cooperative breeders familiarity in and of itself is
not sufficient for discriminating kinship or degrees of relatedness. Treating familiar conspecifics
differently from unfamiliar is orthogonal to treating closer relatives differently from less genetically
similar (closely related) conspecifics. Familiarity does involve learning about the specific identifying
characteristics that enable distinguishing one individual from another thus when two individuals
interact for the first time, each would evaluate their degree of genetic relatedness to the other as
part of their assessment and coding process that enables identification of the other individual as
familiar in subsequent encounters – just as they would evaluate other trait- (e.g. sex) and state- (e.g.
reproductive status, health) dependent characteristics. Any concept of familiarity (becoming
familiar) must include some level of genetic relatedness assessment. Familiarity enables
distinguishing among known individual kin (which technically is not “kin recognition”) and between
the group of known kin and the group of unknown kin – which also is not technically “kin
recognition” because recognition of the degree of relatedness is not part of the discrimination of
familiar individuals from unfamiliar individuals.
We have now changed the wording of this paragraph, to make our point clearer and to avoid the
pitfalls associated with ambiguity in the literature involving the term ‘familiarity’. P7,L32-39.
P 6, l 21-23: “When presenting unfamiliar odours to banded mongooses, we found no evidence that
individuals differ in their responses to odours based on relatedness. This suggests that this species
does not use a mechanism to assess the genetic relatedness of unfamiliar individuals directly.” Not
responding differently in this experimental paradigm to odours of unfamiliar differentially related
conspecifics does not indicate that the subjects were unable to distinguish between those odours
based on the degree of relatedness to them and it certainly does not suggest that they would not
use genetic relatedness information in coding the information about those individual odour donors
should the subject encounter the donors themselves. There has been a lot of progress in
understanding recognition mechanisms since Paul Sherman’s work in the 1980s. As mentioned
above, Giora Heth’s and my paper in Advances in the Study of Behavior (2003) reviews evidence
from multiple rodent species that indicates a process of genetic relatedness assessment across a
broad continuum that relies on widespread findings that individual odours of more closely related
individuals are perceptually similar compared with those of less closely related individuals. This
process is quite different from phenotype matching in the sense that Sherman hypothesized. We
also found (see Todrank et al Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 2011) that the olfactory epithelium
is tuned through exposure (even from gestation) to enhance sensitivity to odours similar to the
individual’s own odour, thus providing a physiological basis for the behavioural mechanism. This
section should be rewritten based on the current understanding.
Another important point. We have now removed the sentence stating that our results suggest that
banded mongooses may not be able to detect relatedness in unfamiliar scents and have instead
focused on reasons why they may not have responded in this case. P7,L41-44 and P8,L1-14.
P 6, l 21-23: It is important to distinguish between what an animal is able to do and what it actually
does. When mating is mostly within the own social group there may be no benefit of acting on the
distinctions but this is different from not being able to make those distinctions. (After reading
further in the discussion, it sounds like there is evidence suggesting that relatedness plays a role in
avoiding inbreeding within the social group.) It may be that, in addition to the small number of
relatives in the unfamiliar group, the protocol that was used for this study was not suited to
demonstrating abilities. Thus it would be accurate to say that distinctions based on relatedness were
not demonstrated rather than that the banded mongoose does not have the ability to make such
distinctions.
We agree. The wording has been changed in this section to focus on the lack of behavioural
discrimination between unfamiliar individuals and the justification for this, including the (quite likely)
possibility that this was due to a corresponding lack of variation in relatedness values. P7,L41-44
and P8,L1-14
P 6, l 46-48: “As a response to relatedness occurs with familiar, but not unfamiliar individuals, this
raises the possibility that banded mongooses are using a learned cue to identify relatives from their
own group.” The response based on relatedness in the familiar group shows the ability and the
behaviour based on that ability thus they must be able to make such distinctions as unfamiliar
individuals are encountered and thus become familiar. What they are learning in this process is not a
cue to identify relatives in general but associating the particular relatedness characteristics identified
with the individual bearing those characteristics. Parentage is not scrambled because of birth
synchrony because the parentage is evident in the individual odours of their offspring. The evidence
presented indicates that banded mongoose can and do make genetic relatedness discriminations
within their groups.
We have expanded on the possibility that information on relatedness is encoded in odours
throughout the paper, but we want to make sure that we exert appropriate caution when
interpreting our results. Based on our study, we cannot exclude the possibility that cues to
relatedness are learned from non-olfactory sources, and that such cues may be apparent at
particular points in the lifecycle (e.g. as juveniles). We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that
distinctions based on kinship may not be possible when becoming familiar with an individual as an
adult. P8 L16-23.
We have added in further explanation of the ‘scrambling’ of cues to parentage due to birth
synchrony in the introduction and we now interpret such scrambling in the context of odour-based
related ness discrimination in the discussion. Note that we currently have no evidence that
parentage is evident in the individual odours of offspring in this species (although we are planning
on investigating this shortly) so we want to exert appropriate caution here. P9,L27-43
P 7, l 34-35: “It is unlikely that scent presentation experiments would be able further to determine
whether phenotype-matching is used to identify relatives from within the group.” It is very likely that
scent presentation experiments designed for the purpose (without the necessity of GCMS) would
demonstrate genetic relatedness assessment abilities both within and across groups whether those
abilities are affect their behavioural responses or not.
We have now included the possibility that further scent presentation experiments may be able to
shed light on this. In particular, we have stated that habituation-dishabituation trials may be able to
reveal whether scents from individuals that are similarly related to the focal individual are perceived
to be more similar than individuals with large differences in relatedness to the focal animal. P9,L15-
20.
The clear differences in responses of males and females could surely be explained by the social
patterns of the species. I am not familiar with the banded mongoose so I would not want to make a
suggestion about this. But I am confident that the authors will be able to come up with a plausible
explanation after re-thinking the results in terms of the new way of looking at familiarity and genetic
relatedness assessment as Todrank and Heth (2003) describe.
We have made changes to this paragraph in line with reviewer 2’s suggestion, including removing
overly speculative comments and adding in discussion of the impact of odour donor sex and age on
responses, which were not previously discussed. P10,L1-18.
I would be happy to help in any way I can as you proceed with the revision.
Thank you very much for your kind offer of assistance. The comments you have provided are clear
and detailed, along with the suggestions of publications to include. We now feel comfortable that
we have addressed all issues raised and the manuscript now better reflects the current literature on
kin discrimination, making it a stronger paper.
Reviewer: 2: Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript deals on the mechanism underlying kin recognition in a cooperative breeding
mammal, where inbreeding is typically rather high. This is an interesting topic and the manuscript is
well written, results clearly presented. The discussion, based on the results, which are not fully
always straight forward, is on few places too speculative and needs some elaboration. See my
specific comment to add some additional information on your argument.
P5, L31: Specify here ‘..whilst odours of older individuals…’ rather than only ‘…whilst older odours..’.
At least I assume the discrimination is not due to the age of the odour sample, but due to the ager of
the odour donor?
Thank you for pointing this out. This has been amended in the text here (and anywhere else where
this was unclear). P6,L38
I also wonder about this result. You do not discuss it? What explains such an age effect? See also
comment P7, L19 further down.
We have now added an explanation of why responses to the age of the odour donor may occur. “We
also found that response to odours differed depending on the age of the donor, with the odour of
older individuals receiving weaker responses, at least among familiar individuals. This may occur
because more dominant individuals (usually the older individuals in the group) scent mark at higher
rates, hence group-members may become habituated to these odours and therefore show a
reduced response. This may also explain why a response to age was not seen between unfamiliar
individuals where there was no opportunity to habituate to the odours prior to the experiment.”
P9,L8-15
P6, L21-L42: Could the lack of discrimination of relatedness in unfamiliar samples not simple be
explained that all of these donors are much less related to the recipient. Therefore, to expect a
discrimination based on relatedness at the level of mainly <0.125 in unfamiliar groups versus the
very high relatedness ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 in the familiar groups would not be surprising. I
suggest to at least discuss this more obvious. Even though sample size would be very small, if you
only compared the same relatedness levels in familiar and non-familiar groups, would you still get a
significant discrimination in the familiar groups? Or would potentially in the unfamiliar groups a
potential trend for discrimination of relatedness come up?
This possibility could indeed explain our results and we have now added it into the discussion. P8,
L10-14
We have tried analysing the data as you suggest; when we restrict the familiar dataset to
relatedness values more commonly seen in unfamiliar groups (under 0.125), we find that the effect
of relatedness becomes marginally non-significant (LMM: Chi2 =3.75, p=0.053). However, the sample
size of the restricted dataset (159 presentations) was approximately half of the sample size of the
full dataset (302 presentations). It is therefore difficult to say whether the lack of a significant
relationship was due to reduced sample size or the lack of an effect. Due to this ambiguity, we do
not think that this analysis would add much to the manuscript. Instead, we suggest further scent
presentation experiments, along with chemical analysis of scent data.
P6, L59: Typing error? ‘…has appears…’?
This point has been amended in text P8,L28
P7, L19-L21: However, you did find an age effect in several of the analysis. Even though currently you
may not have founder individuals in there, any of the first offspring generation would still have been
the opportunity to distinguish the founders as their potential parents and their cohort as closely
related in comparison to any of the next litters, if I understand the system correctly. Were there still
1st generation offspring in your groups? Maybe this could explain your findings on age effects in the
responses to the samples.
Unfortunately, there were no first generation offspring remaining in our study groups so we were
unable to test this possibility. Groups are founded when a cohort of related females from one natal
group joins with a cohort of related males from a different social group. This means that first
generation offspring would be related to multiple adults of both sexes (in addition to being related
to their own cohort). For example, their aunts and uncles would be present in the group, in addition
to siblings and cousins. In addition, although group founders would be aware that they immigrated
from a different social group, it is unclear how first generation offspring would be able to identify
themselves as such.
P7, L50-L52: Although this is an interesting suggestion, please can you reason why this could be the
case. As it is, or from the manuscript it is not immediately obvious why this should be expected?
Otherwise, it is left too much of a pure speculation.
As we’ve considered this point further, we’ve decided that our existing suggestion is indeed too
speculative and have removed it from the paper. If males were using odours primarily for mate-
choice, as we originally suggested, we would expect males to show particular interest in odours from
unrelated females, while they would not be expected to show particular interest in odours from
unrelated males. Similarly, if females used odours to assess the competitive landscape within
females, we would expect them to show particular interest in closely related females (as they are
most likely to evict them from the group) but we would not expect them to show a particular
interest in the odour of related males. We would therefore expect to find a significant three-way
interaction between the sex of the odour donor, the sex of the odour recipient and the relatedness
between the two. However, there is no such significant interaction in our data. We have therefore
left the explanation of why there are differences between the sexes in regards to this relatedness
response open. This reflects the fact that our study was designed to reveal whether factors such as
relatedness were responded to, rather than to understand why particular responses may occur.
We have also added into this paragraph an explanation of why responses to the age and sex of the
odour donor may occur (our remaining findings that were not explicitly discussed): “We also found
that response to odours differed depending on the age of the donor, with the odour of older
individuals receiving weaker responses, at least among familiar individuals. This may occur because
more dominant individuals (usually the older individuals in the group) scent mark at higher rates,
hence group-members may become habituated to these odours and therefore show a reduced
response. This may also explain why a response to age was not seen between unfamiliar individuals
where there was no opportunity to habituate to the odours prior to the experiment. Finally, we
found that responses to unfamiliar odours varied based on sex, with females receiving greater
marking responses. Here, it is likely that individuals are responding directly to chemical differences
between the sexes as a previous study has demonstrated sex-differences in odour profiles.” P10,L8-
18
Tables and Figures (also text): I would rather use the term ‘donor sex’, ‘donor age’, etc…. than ‘odour
sex’ or ‘odour age’. It would be ok for ‘odour sex’, but ‘odour age’ could mean
We have now amended this in text and figures with reviewer 1&2 wording suggestions combined.
We would like to thank the reviewers once again for their constructive comments. We feel that the
paper is much improved, particularly with regards to interpreting our findings in the context of
existing literature. We hope that the manuscript is now suitable for publication and we look
forwards to hearing back from you.
