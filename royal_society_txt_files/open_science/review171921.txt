The authors reported on the first-principles calculations of the electronic structure, elastic
properties and acoustic wave velocity of cubic WO3 phase. However, I would not like to
recommend its publication in the current form. If the authors want to modify it by following my
suggestions and comments, I am happy to reconsider it to be published in this journal.
1) Electronic band structure is what I mainly concern. There is no doubt that as pointed in some
pervious publications WO3 is a strongly correlated material. Therefore, the first-principles
calculations within the standard framework of density functional theory I believe that this are no
any new results which need to be added in literature. In the first, the authors should pay more
attentions to previous literature. For instance, how large band gap was reported by the
experiments? The authors only mentioned that the theoretically calculated indirect band gap of
0.606 eV, which is smaller than the experimental value (however, here the authors even did not
mentioned the experimental band gap size). Although the authors mentioned that disregarding
of the treatment of exchange-correlated function there is no any impact on their current
discussion. I think that it is important to see that the specified electronic structure and their
density of states by considering the correlated effects even using LDA+U method would be better
and reasonable. Currently, these calculations are too simple!
2) Concerning the elastic constants, the authors calculated their elastic constants of C11, C12 and
C44 first using the first-principles calculations. Then, they derived the elastic modulii of
polycrsytalline samples according to empirical Hill approximation. In my opinion, all these
calculations are highly standard in the field of the first-principles calculations. I would like to
suggest that the authors perform more profound calculations for ideal strength of WO3 and
further derive its Vickers hardness. Because the authors already obtained Young and Shear
modulii of WO3, I remembered that there was a nice empirical formula to predict Vickers'
hardness using the input of Young and Shear modulii (see Intermetallics, 19, 1725, 2011). In
addition, the authors may need doubly check the related experimental data to compare their
calculated data in this manuscript. Otherwise, the mechanical properties are still highly lacking in
the manuscript.
3) Concerning Debye temperature and anisotropic wave velocity, I also did not agree with the
authors' claim that in both directions it is transverse isotropy for both [100] and [111]. What we
can learn from Table 3 DO show their different value. In addition, it is a bit confusing along [111]
direction vt1 and vt2 have the same value of 5651!!! Did the authors really check this value? In
addition, I also suggest the authors to calculate its phonon dispersion in this cubic phase.
4) How about the calculated lattice constant of WO3? If compared with experimental value, how?
5) In this manuscript English needs to be heavily polished. So many mistakes can be found!
In summary, I would not like to recommend its publication. However, if the authors can modify
it according to my suggestions and comments, I would like to reconsider it again.

The manuscript describes the electronic structure of the cubic WO3 structure, as well Debye
temperature and elasticity study of this material. While the manuscript is well written and
presents relevant data to field, my concern is regarding the convergence of the results.
The material's phase is unknown in experimental conditions, which means that all calculations
must be carried out taking into out very careful convergence tests. For example, in a recent
manuscript (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.10411 ) studying elastic properties under
high pressure conditions, it was employed a kinetic energy cutoff of 90 Ry ( ~1220 eV). I
understand that it is a different material. On the other hand, it is known on the literature that
elastic properties are much more sensitive to the convergence parameters.
My recommendation is a major review of the manuscript: once the authors provide the
convergence results needed, their results will be employed as the standard basis for future
studies of cubic WO3.
Comments:
1) The authors must provide a graph for the total energy difference in function of the kinetic
energy cutoff, it can be added as a supplementary material. Also make clear which is the error
deviation on the total energy. The k-point grid should be also checked.
2) If previous calculations using Tungstein (W) with the same CASTEP pseudopotential was
already done on the literature, it must be cited on the computational details as a reference.
3) Page 4, Line 43: It should be Figure 5(a) instead Figure 3(a).
4) did the authors used only the primitive cell or a supercell? Please provide further informations
regarding the number of atoms employed in the calculation.

5) The Caption of the Figure 5 should also better detail the items (a), (b) and (c).
