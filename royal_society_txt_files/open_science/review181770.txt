Overview:---
This is a relatively well written paper that presents the results of a study of wetland-use by a
community living in an ecologically sensitive part of South Africa. The dataset on which the
results are based is valuable, and the results of the study are likely to be of some interest even to a
general audience. Publication of the paper in its present form cannot however be recommended
because (1) inappropriate methods have been used for some of the analyses; (2) the results of
some of the analyses are incorrectly interpreted; and (3) the scales that have been used to measure
benefit from and damage to wetlands are insufficiently unidimensional, and to some extent are
conflated (they partly measure each other). Once these problems have been fixed, and parts of the
paper rethought, I think that the results would be worth publishing.
Below I briefly review the main problems I identified, beginning with a set of lesser problems. In
the last part of my review, under the head Detailed Comments, I address these and other issues
in greater detail and more directly, on a line-by-line basis. I have also attached a report in which I
provide further proofs of most of the key issues and code to support the alternative analyses that
I propose.
Relatively Minor, but Nonetheless Important Problems Are:---
1) The authors treat the individual items of each scale, i.e. the 16 questions of their survey, as if
they are interval- or ratio-level variables, i.e. continuous variables. However, each question is an
ordinal-level variable (an ordered factor) with just three categories (Never, Sometimes, Always).
This affects their calculation of statistics on the reliability, validity, and dimensionality of each
scale, where Pearson correlations are used. Polychoric correlations should have been used
instead. Revelle's omega function, which the authors used to calculate these statistics, uses
Pearson correlations by default, but there is an argument to that function that allows polychoric
correlations to be used (in the event that scale items have fewer than ~ seven categories or levels).
Incorrectly treating individual items as if they are continuous variables also affects the results
reported in Table 3, where the means and standard errors of individual questions are calculated
and reported. In my Detailed Comments I propose a replacement analysis, which I flesh out in
my attached report. Good options are to use Wilcoxon signed-rank tests or Cliff's delta statistics
(R package orddom). See Carifio & Perla (2007) and Brown (2011) for notes on the distinction
between the items of a scale and the scale itself, and what the acceptable numerical treatment of
each is. Also see Cliff (1993, 1996).
2) The authors fit no-intercept regressions (but do not tell the reader); the results are reported in
Table 2. They then make the mistake of interpreting the statistics that result from those
regressions as if they derive from regressions that were fitted with an intercept term. R^2
(coefficient of determination) values from intercept- and no-intercept regressions have
fundamentally different interpretations (true for all reputable statistical software programs).
Notably, the R^2 value from a no-intercept regression does not represent the amount of variance
of the regressand (response) that the regressor (predictor) explains; it also does not represent the
extent to which the regressand and the regressor are associated. This is relatively easy to
demonstrate. The Pearson correlation coefficient (measures linear association) between the
regressor and the regressand of the first regression listed in Table 2 (Benefits from wetlands) is
0.140. If we square this we get the R^2 for an ordinary least-squares model fitted with an
intercept term, which is 0.020, compared to 0.944 for the no-intercept regression. Given that the
3
accepted interpretation of models fitted with an intercept term represents the proportion of
variance in the response variable that the predictor explains (here ~ 2% compared to ~ 94% for
the no-intercept regression), R^2 values from no-intercept models cannot, ipso facto, have the
same interpretation but must have a wholly different one. The R^2 value from a no-intercept
regression in fact measures the proportion of the variability _about the origin_ that the regression
explains, and not the proportion of variability of the response variable as a whole, or around the
grand mean, that the regression explains. See Hocking (1996) and Eisenhauer (2003) and
elsewhere.
Additionally, the estimated slope-coefficients of no-intercept models depend on the strong
theoretical assumption that the expected value of the response variable is zero when the value of
the predictor variable is zero. The authors provide no evidence to support such a claim, which,
indeed, seems to be part of what they are trying prove. For the first regression reported in Table
2, the slope coefficient for an intercept-based regression is 0.10 not 0.88. It might also be noted
that the estimates reported for the first regression (Benefits from wetlands) are in any case wrong
because the authors mistakenly included two questions, viz Q5 and Q11, in both the regressor
and the regressand when calculating the mean-scores of sub-scales that they use in the regression.
While it might be of some interest to know how the two subscales of each scale relate to each
other (i.e. how the self-assessed and perceived-group effects relate to each other), this type of
analysis should not be necessary if the main scales are sharpened (or refined) to be truly
unidimensional. The authors would probably be better off carrying out some form of
agreement/concordance analysis, though Lin`s concordance correlation coefficient (Lin 1989; Lin
et al. 2002) is probably too exacting. Bland-Altman (i.e. Tukey's mean-difference) plots, coupled
with paired t-tests or a non-parametric or Bayesian alternative, would probably be adequate. See
the R packages granovaGG (function granovagg.ds), epiTools, MethComp, Agreement, amongst
others.
This brings me to a final issue under this head. Ordinary least-squares regression is not
appropriate when both the regressor and the regressand are measured with approximately the
same degree of error, as they are here. The methods I have just referred to, viz
agreement/concordance analysis, use major-axis (or Deming) regression as a central tool. It is the
appropriate type of regression to use when regressing one psychometric or survey-based scale on
another one. See R packages lmodel2 and smatr and references therein.
3) The authors use pairwise correlations to assess the collinearity of putative predictors for the
model they summarize in Figure 3 and Table 4. Pairwise correlations are neither an appropriate
nor a recommended way of assessing collinearity, and do not provide grounds for excluding
variables from the model. The reason of this is that collinearity depends on jointly assessing all
the predictors in the model. Recommended approaches rely on (generalized) variance-inflation
factors and condition indices of the design matrix (Belsley et al. 1980 [2004]). See vif() in Fox's car
package for R, and ols_coll_diag() in Hebbali's olsrr package for R.
Were the authors to use these methods to test for collinearity they would find that neither of the
two variables they exclude come close to showing signs of being collinear with other variables. In
fact, the most collinear putative predictor is Position (role played in the community), which has a
generalized variance-inflation factor of 2.64. This is well below the recommended value of >4,
which is when one begins to suspect that there might be a sufficient degree of collinearity to
begin to affect parameter estimates. Values above 10 are generally recognized as indicating a
degree of collinearity that needs fixing.
The Main Problem:---
The authors results and conclusions rest on the reliability, unidimensionality, and validity of the
4
two scales they use. Having explored these scales in considerable detail while preparing this
review I am not convinced by the authors' argument that the scales are sufficiently
unidimensional for mean-scores (that have a clear interpretation) to be formed, and therefore for
the analysis to proceed.
In supporting their argument, the authors cite Wilhelm-Rechmann et al. (2014) [which I was a
coauthor of] and Reise et al. (2010). However, there are fundamental differences between the
arguments of Wilhelm-Rechmann et al. (2014) and the present study, notably: (1) the statistics on
unidimensionality reported by Wilhelm-Rechmann et al. are better than those reported here; (2)
the scale Wilhelm-Rechmann et al. used, the NEP (New Environmental Paradigm) scale, is a
known quantity that has been used in hundreds of studies worldwide with reliable results,
despite showing signs of being weakly multidimensional; (3) five-point items, which the NEP
scale uses, are more likely to give the spurious impression of multidimensionality than three-
point items are; and (4) Wilhelm-Rechmann et al. were able to demonstrate the robustness of their
findings by favourably comparing them with (a) the results of a meta-analysis of 69 studies
spanning 36 nations, and (b) the results of Dunlap et al.'s survey of residents of Washington State
(USA). See Wilhelm-Rechmann et al. (2014) for details. The authors of the present paper
unfortunately do not have access to such "back-stop" studies that might be used to sway the
argument or corroborate their results.
In rejecting the authors' arguments on this fundamentally important question (how much
multidimensionality is too much) I have additionally been swayed by the following facts. In
deciding whether a multidimensional scale is sufficiently unidimensional for analysis to proceed
safely, Reise (see the reference list and the help file for Revelle's omega function in R) stresses an
index known as the explained common variance (ECV), which he calls a 'cleaner index of
"undimensionality"' than omega hierarchical (Reise et al. 2010). He and his associates recommend
that this be > 0.70, except if the percentage of uncontaminated correlations (PUC) is high (> 0.80),
in which case an ECV > 0.50 would be acceptable (Reise et al. 2016). When PUC is less than 0.80
then Reise and associates recommend that ECV > 0.60 and that omega hierarchical be > 0.70. Only
then can one be reasonably sure that the presence of some multidimensionality is not severe
enough to disqualify the interpretation of the scale as being primarily unidimensional (Reise et al.
2013).
The problem is that the authors' scales have ECV and PUC values of 0.38/0.36
(Pearson/polychoric correlations) and 0.64/0.55, respectively, for the benefits scale, and ECV and
PUC values of 0.34/0.36 and 0.56/0.56, respectively, for the damage-focused scale. Revelle's beta
coefficient for the two scales is also unacceptably low, being 0.26/0.20 and 0.25/0.07, respectively.
At the very least, it should be > 0.5, and preferably should be > 0.7 (Revelle 1979, Cooksey &
Soutar 2006). In short, there is no evidence to support the authors' view that their scales are
sufficiently unidimensional for them to be treated as if they are unidimensional, and hence for
mean (or summated) scores to have a clear interpretation.
As they stand, the two scales are moderately correlated (r = 0.378). This indicates a degree of
conflation between them, a suspicion that is confirmed by exploratory analysis using tools
designed to select unidimensional scales. Mokken Scale Analysis (R package mokken), for
instance, excludes Q5, Q11, and Q15 from any scale, and puts three items from the scale to asses
damage to the wetland (Q2, Q8, Q16) on the scale to assess benefits from the wetland, and it puts
one item from the scale to assess benefits from the wetland (Q9) on the scale to assess damage to
the wetland. These Mokken-based scales, with mixed questions from the original two scales. have
considerably better statistics on reliability and dimensionality than the scales formed by the
authors; they also are not correlated (r = 0.091).
Using a set of tools that I routinely use, I was able to manually select items from each scale that
5
are indisputably undimensional, based on the criteria suggested by Reise and associates (op. cit.).
Significantly most of the items that I excluded, viz Q5, Q7, Q9, Q2, Q8, and Q16, are items that the
foregoing exploratory methods either excluded or put on the other scale, viz Q9 on one hand, and
Q2, Q8, and Q16 on the other. The two scales that are formed after these exclusions[*] are not
correlated (r = 0.072) and have omega hierarchical, ECV, and PUC statistics (based on polychoric
correlations) of 0.71, 0.68, and 0.67 for the benefit-scale, and 0.69, 0.63, and 0.53 for the damage-
scale. These are good scale-statistics for data of this type.
[*] Revised benefits scale: [Q1,Q3,Q11,Q13,Q15] (excludes Q5,Q7,Q9); revised damage scale:
[Q4,Q6,Q10,Q12,Q14] (excludes Q2,Q8,Q16).
The foregoing findings mean that were the authors prepared to revise their scales along the lines I
have proposed, there is much that they could rescue from this interesting study (and worthwhile
dataset) and be confident about the findings. There is no reason, I think, why at least some of the
excluded items (i.e. questions), namely those that measure clearly defined activities like grazing
(Q2) and burning (Q8, Q16), could not be used as ancillary variables in supporting analyses. For
instance, they could perhaps be used as predictors in the replacement-analysis I suggest for Table
2. See the expository document/code that I have attached for ideas and supporting proofs.

Detailed Comments:---
Page 2 Line 24: Strictly, "rival" should be "rivalrous." (Or, "resources that rival each other...but are
non-excludable...." Or maybe, "...resources that are rivals...but are non-excludable....")
Page 2 Line 42--43: for [the] ecological functioning. Think you need to add the definite article.
Page 2 Line 43--50: The two "lists" in this paragraph are ambiguous. The "from" that starts the first
list does not apply to all of its elements except if you itemize/enumerate them. If not, then you
should use "from provisioning ecosystem services...from regulating ecosystem service...and from
cultural ecosystem services...." More important is the second list, where there is an unclear
contrast between the first three items and the "or" that separates the last item. Was this really an
"either/or" quantification, or do you perhaps mean, "...the grazing, burning, and ploughing
(cultivation) of wetlands, and whether..."? Surely all four activities were quantified?
Page 2 Line 51--52: First instance of "of" should be "on". For the latter, the complete statement
would (and perhaps should) be, "information on the demographic data of respondents."
Page 2 Line 53: You need to state your rationale."The reason for collecting demographic data is
that...."
Page 3 Line 6: "respondents" needs a plural apostrophe (respondents') and a comma after
"community". But the following might be better: "...the questionnaire asked respondents about
their roles in the community, to distinguish...."
Page 3 Line 15: Should be, "The information on...."
Page 3 Line 34--36: Meaning of the last sentence is not clear; presumably it's that, because of the
area's uniqueness, a loss of biodiversity would have a global impact. If so, then try, "..., MAP is
regarded as a geographic[al]* area where a local loss of biodiversity would have a global impact."
[* Note: Figure 1 uses "geographical" not "geographic".]
Page 4 Line 12--13: "..., which we assumed to be an underlying cause..." would be better.
Page 4 Line 24: Need "into Xhosa".
Page 4 Line 37: Possessive case: needs to be, "respondents' demographic variables...."
Page 4 Line 48--49: Incomplete. Try, "The even-numbered questions of Section B were used to
determine [assess] damage-causing activities...."
Page 4 Para beginning Line 50--51: Based on an examination of your code, I don't see that your
description matches what you did. For instance, for the benefits.self ~ benefits.group regression,
the regressor and regressand share two questions (Q5, Q11), the other three being different (so
five questions each); whereas for the damage.self ~ damage.group regression, the regressor and
regressand are each based on four questions (so four questions each), with no shared questions.
Clearly you made a mistake when calculating mean-scores for the benefits.self and benefits.group
subscales. But even then, your description remains confusing and confused. It's clear to me, but
only because I scrutinized your code and the accompanying analyses, that each scale is _based_
on four questions, each of which was asked twice, giving eight sets of answers for each scale, and
a total of 16 sets of answers for the two scales together. It is misleading to say, as you do, that
7
each question in section B was asked twice, because in the preceding paragraph (Line 41) you say
that "Section B comprised of 16 questions." If each question was asked twice, and there are 16
questions in all, then there should be 32 sets of answers or scores, which there are not. Note also
that sometimes you capitalize "Section B" in mid-sentence and sometimes you don't, writing
"section B."
Page 4 Line 52--53: Leave out "asking."
Page 4 Line 54: Should be "are," not "is" [to see this, leave out "perceived"].
Page 4 Line 56 & Page 5 Line 6--9: See point 2 of my introductory remarks for discussion of the
problems associated with these regressions and with your interpretation of them. Briefly,
addressing just the core problem, you fitted no-intercept models, which fundamentally changes
the interpretation of R^2, the coefficient of determination. Notably, it loses all connexion to the
correlation-based interpretation that you give it. And just as significantly, you omitted to tell the
reader that this is what you did. The R^2 for the intercept-based benefits model is 0.01964, which
is equal to cor(y,x)^2, which in turn is equal to a Pearson correlation of 0.1401. In short, this
means that there is no demonstrable relationship between the two sets of scores, as measured by
Pearson correlation (or, in fact, Spearman/Kendall correlations). Yet R^2 for the no-intercept
version of the model is 0.944. An informed reader, unaware that you've fitted a model without an
intercept (because nowhere do you say that that is what you fitted), would assume that a strong
linear relationship between the two forms of the benefits variable exists (Pearson correlation =
0.972), when in fact this is not so. The same general remarks apply to the other regression. The
results you present in Table 2, and in the second paragraph of Results on pages 5 and 6, are
therefore not only wrong but highly misleading.
Page 5 Line 17: Should be "odd- and even-numbered...."
Page 5 Line 32--34: The following is not true: "...every single respondent was Xhosa, meaning that
there was no language variation within the community." Your dataset shows that one respondent
spoke seSotho and one spoke English. They may all have identified themselves as belonging to
the Xhosa people, but that is an essentially different thing.
Page 5 Line 35--37 et seq.: Pairwise correlation is not a recommended/accepted method of testing
for (multi)collinearity. See point 3 of my introductory remarks.
Page 5 Line 36: Should be "correlated with".
Page 5 Line 43--45: Results are selective because there are no grounds on the basis of collinearity
for excluding the predictors you did. Also, you need to tell the reader that the F-values and P-
values you report in Table IV are based on a sequential decomposition of the sums of squares, i.e.
so-called Type I or sequential ANOVA, rather than on Type II or Type III (which here are the
same).
Page 5 Line 51--52: "...and low levels of education..." is better (education is a noun, not an
adjective).
Page 5 Line 52--55: The statistics you report are highly misleading and do not support your
claims. As I've noted above, and in my introductory remarks, R^2 from a no-intercept regression
does not measure association. To get that type of interpretation you need to fit a regression model
with an intercept term. The square-root of the R^2 value from such a regression would indicate
the degree of linear association and for your data is r = 0.140. The R^2 and beta (slope-coefficient)
for the model are 0.020 (r = 0.140 ~= 0.020^.5) and 0.100, respectively.
Page 6 Line 39--43: This is the same issue as that just noted, namely interpreting the statistics from
a no-intercept model as if it's an intercept-based model. Categorically, the R^2 value from a no-
intercept model does not estimate the amount of variance in the response variable explained by
the predictor(s). See point 2 of my introductory comments and the references I cite there. If one
fits a model with an intercept term then the variance in self-reported damage that the model
explains is 36% not 75%, and the slope-coefficient is 0.652 not 0.528. Hence, respondents are not
twice as likely to attribute damage to someone else than to themselves. Pearson's correlation
coefficient is 0.584.
8
Page 6 Table 2 Caption: Somewhat muddled, and you have written "from from" (repeated).
Maybe try something along the lines of: "Summary statistics from separate linear regressions of
self-reported benefits and self-reported damage on perceived community benefits and perceived
community damage, respectively."
Page 6 Table 2: The statistics you report do not have the interpretation you have given them. As I
have noted above, you interpret these statistics as if you fitted models with an intercept term but
the truth is that you fitted no-intercept models while omitting to say so. Further, for the no-
intercept model for Benefits, the slope-coefficient you report should be 0.883 not 0.880.
Page 6 Line 55--56: "...wetland, results found a positive, statistically significant relationship...."
Results themselves do not find, they suggest or indicate some result or finding. You might say,
"...wetland, we found..." or "...wetland, the results indicate..." or "...wetland, the results support
the finding/fact...."
Page 7 Line 30--32: You fitted an additive model (Table 4, Figure 3), which conditions on, or takes
account of, the effect of other predictors in the model; it does not test whether the effect of self-
reported damage on self-reported benefits (Figure 3-a) depends on values (or levels) of these
other predictors. Hence, you provide no evidence to support your claim that the positive effect of
self-reported damage on self-reported benefits is consistent across age, gender, level of education,
and employment category. To test this, you would need to have fitted a multiplicative model in
which self-reported damage interacted with the other predictors, i.e. a model of the form: benefit
~ damage * (other predictors). If you do this, then your claim indeed holds good; however,
nowhere do you explicitly fit, discuss, or present the results of such a model.
Page 7 Line 34: Residency is not collinear if one uses a reliable test to test collinearity.
Page 7 Line 36--38 & Table 3: I am not convinced by this approach, which strictly speaking is
wrong. The main problem is that you are taking means and standard errors of individual
questions as if each is a continuous variables, which it is not. Each is an ordinal-level variable.
While most authorities consider it to be permissable to take the mean of several ordinal-level
items/questions and to treat the result as a continuous variable, this is not true for the analysis of
individual questions. Each of your questions is an ordered factor with just three levels or
categories (0,1, and 2), i.e. your questions are not an interval- or ratio-scale variables, which
would allow the calculation of such statistics without criticism. The problem is essentially the
same as one I mentioned above: when using Revelle's omega function to calculate statistics on
reliability and dimensionality for your scales (to measure benefits and damage) you used Pearson
correlation (the default) rather than polychoric correlations. See Carifio & Perla (2007), Brown
(2011), and elsewhere on this issue. I also don't think that you have made it clear enough to the
reader that these four activities represent the measurement variables of the scale you used to
measure damage to the wetland, i.e. the eight even-numbered questions of your survey. Finally,
if you were to use this type of approach (but you should not) then you need to use confidence
intervals (bootstrapped) not standard errors. See §3 of my report where I suggest replacement
analyses. For the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests that I carry out there, all you would need are the
estimate of the location shift (Est. = pseudomedian), the associated 95% confidence intervals, and
perhaps p-values (for exact p-values in the presence of ties see wilcoxsign_test() in package coin).
Arguably a more powerful/detailed approach would be to use Cliff's delta statistics. See R
package orddom.
Page 7 Line 36--38: To make this clear, you need to add "self-reported damage" or "Damage-
causing activities" in brackets after "...they partook grazing, ploughing, dumping or burning" so
that there is an explicit link to Table 4/Figure 3-a.
Page 7 Line 38: Preposition missing: usually one "partakes of" or "partook in." But the real
problem here is that it is not the residents/respondents themselves who are doing the grazing, it's
the livestock. You are looking for something simple like, "...was how often they used the wetland
for grazing, ploughing, dumping or burning."

The study is important as it is from a region with limited literature on community dependence on
wetlands, thus it is an area of interest. However there are certain flaws that cannot be ignored.
Hence this manuscript cannot be published in its present form.
Detailed comments are as:
1. The manuscript needs proper editing.
2. Introduction is fluid and lacks conviction
3. The title reads as Ecosystem services and ecological degradation of communal wetlands in a
South African biodiversity hotspot, but the study reported in the manuscript is from a single
village located in the biodiversity hotspot and the study also reflects the results from a single
wetland, hence there is a complete mis-match of the study design and the title.
4. The study area description fails to provide the overview on the area and type of wetland and
the ecosystem services provided therein by the wetland. It is crucial to enumerate few of the
ecosystem services and goods provided by the particular wetland, which is the focus of the study.
5. It will be useful to know the species assemblage in Ward 32 where the study has been
conducted. Particularly interesting will be the name of some endemic species of the region
6. Page 4; Lines 6-8: The authors have mentioned Protected Areas only once in the entire
manuscript. However it will be interesting to know the percentage coverage of the MAP under
protected area network.
7. Page 4; lines 9-10: It will be useful to provide a list of traditional activities carried out by people
in the wetlands.
8. What kind of environment degradation the authors are referring to? The authors need to
specify.
9. Page 4; Lines 15-17: Furthermore, each of the  56% and the youth unemployment ratio
was 61%.
Replace ratio with percent.
10. Page 4: Questionnaire Design
This section needs to be re-written to reflect the variables used, the type of questions used (open-
ended or close-ended). If close ended what was scale used?
Differences between these categories were tested using a repeated measures ANOVA (lme
11
command in nlme package) followed by a post-hoc multiple comparisons pairwise t-test with
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison
Do the author mean that difference between responses to the ecosystem services were tested? The
authors need to rewrite this section to make the design clear.
Reading the results and specifically Figure 2 show that the authors have tried the t-test between
the two groups of respondents: one which always derived benefits and the other group which
occasionally derives benefits. This analysis doesnt make any sense. What is the scale used in
figure 2 (Y-Axis)? It is unclear.
The methodology is flawed and the authors need to rework on the explanation of questionnaire
design and analysis. I suggest that they refer to some previously published papers on wetland
benefits and community attitude (Ambastha et al., 2008; Hussain and Badola, 2008, 2009; Badola
et al. 2013).
11. Page 9; lines 35-39: The authors have justly used the Ostroms concept of sustainable use in
the discussion but have failed to reflect the same in their methods and results.
My overall impression is that the MS needs major revision.

Comments to the Author(s)
Overview:---
This is a relatively well written paper that presents the results of a study of wetland-use by a
community living in an ecologically sensitive part of South Africa. The dataset on which the
results are based is valuable, and the results of the study are likely to be of some interest even to a
general audience. Publication of the paper in its present form cannot however be recommended
because (1) inappropriate methods have been used for some of the analyses; (2) the results of
some of the analyses are incorrectly interpreted; and (3) the scales that have been used to measure
benefit from and damage to wetlands are insufficiently unidimensional, and to some extent are
conflated (they partly measure each other). Once these problems have been fixed, and parts of the
paper rethought, I think that the results would be worth publishing.
Below I briefly review the main problems I identified, beginning with a set of lesser problems. In
the last part of my review, under the head Detailed Comments, I address these and other issues
in greater detail and more directly, on a line-by-line basis. I have also attached a report in which I
provide further proofs of most of the key issues and code to support the alternative analyses that
I propose.
13
Relatively Minor, but Nonetheless Important Problems Are:---
1) The authors treat the individual items of each scale, i.e. the 16 questions of their survey, as if
they are interval- or ratio-level variables, i.e. continuous variables. However, each question is an
ordinal-level variable (an ordered factor) with just three categories (Never, Sometimes, Always).
This affects their calculation of statistics on the reliability, validity, and dimensionality of each
scale, where Pearson correlations are used. Polychoric correlations should have been used
instead. Revelle's omega function, which the authors used to calculate these statistics, uses
Pearson correlations by default, but there is an argument to that function that allows polychoric
correlations to be used (in the event that scale items have fewer than ~ seven categories or levels).
Incorrectly treating individual items as if they are continuous variables also affects the results
reported in Table 3, where the means and standard errors of individual questions are calculated
and reported. In my Detailed Comments I propose a replacement analysis, which I flesh out in
my attached report. Good options are to use Wilcoxon signed-rank tests or Cliff's delta statistics
(R package orddom). See Carifio & Perla (2007) and Brown (2011) for notes on the distinction
between the items of a scale and the scale itself, and what the acceptable numerical treatment of
each is. Also see Cliff (1993, 1996).
2) The authors fit no-intercept regressions (but do not tell the reader); the results are reported in
Table 2. They then make the mistake of interpreting the statistics that result from those
regressions as if they derive from regressions that were fitted with an intercept term. R^2
(coefficient of determination) values from intercept- and no-intercept regressions have
fundamentally different interpretations (true for all reputable statistical software programs).
Notably, the R^2 value from a no-intercept regression does not represent the amount of variance
of the regressand (response) that the regressor (predictor) explains; it also does not represent the
extent to which the regressand and the regressor are associated. This is relatively easy to
demonstrate. The Pearson correlation coefficient (measures linear association) between the
regressor and the regressand of the first regression listed in Table 2 (Benefits from wetlands) is
0.140. If we square this we get the R^2 for an ordinary least-squares model fitted with an
intercept term, which is 0.020, compared to 0.944 for the no-intercept regression. Given that the
accepted interpretation of models fitted with an intercept term represents the proportion of
variance in the response variable that the predictor explains (here ~ 2% compared to ~ 94% for
the no-intercept regression), R^2 values from no-intercept models cannot, ipso facto, have the
same interpretation but must have a wholly different one. The R^2 value from a no-intercept
regression in fact measures the proportion of the variability _about the origin_ that the regression
explains, and not the proportion of variability of the response variable as a whole, or around the
grand mean, that the regression explains. See Hocking (1996) and Eisenhauer (2003) and
elsewhere.
Additionally, the estimated slope-coefficients of no-intercept models depend on the strong
theoretical assumption that the expected value of the response variable is zero when the value of
the predictor variable is zero. The authors provide no evidence to support such a claim, which,
indeed, seems to be part of what they are trying prove. For the first regression reported in Table
2, the slope coefficient for an intercept-based regression is 0.10 not 0.88. It might also be noted
that the estimates reported for the first regression (Benefits from wetlands) are in any case wrong
because the authors mistakenly included two questions, viz Q5 and Q11, in both the regressor
and the regressand when calculating the mean-scores of sub-scales that they use in the regression.
While it might be of some interest to know how the two subscales of each scale relate to each
other (i.e. how the self-assessed and perceived-group effects relate to each other), this type of
analysis should not be necessary if the main scales are sharpened (or refined) to be truly
unidimensional. The authors would probably be better off carrying out some form of
agreement/concordance analysis, though Lin`s concordance correlation coefficient (Lin 1989; Lin
14
et al. 2002) is probably too exacting. Bland-Altman (i.e. Tukey's mean-difference) plots, coupled
with paired t-tests or a non-parametric or Bayesian alternative, would probably be adequate. See
the R packages granovaGG (function granovagg.ds), epiTools, MethComp, Agreement, amongst
others.
This brings me to a final issue under this head. Ordinary least-squares regression is not
appropriate when both the regressor and the regressand are measured with approximately the
same degree of error, as they are here. The methods I have just referred to, viz
agreement/concordance analysis, use major-axis (or Deming) regression as a central tool. It is the
appropriate type of regression to use when regressing one psychometric or survey-based scale on
another one. See R packages lmodel2 and smatr and references therein.
3) The authors use pairwise correlations to assess the collinearity of putative predictors for the
model they summarize in Figure 3 and Table 4. Pairwise correlations are neither an appropriate
nor a recommended way of assessing collinearity, and do not provide grounds for excluding
variables from the model. The reason of this is that collinearity depends on jointly assessing all
the predictors in the model. Recommended approaches rely on (generalized) variance-inflation
factors and condition indices of the design matrix (Belsley et al. 1980 [2004]). See vif() in Fox's car
package for R, and ols_coll_diag() in Hebbali's olsrr package for R.
Were the authors to use these methods to test for collinearity they would find that neither of the
two variables they exclude come close to showing signs of being collinear with other variables. In
fact, the most collinear putative predictor is Position (role played in the community), which has a
generalized variance-inflation factor of 2.64. This is well below the recommended value of >4,
which is when one begins to suspect that there might be a sufficient degree of collinearity to
begin to affect parameter estimates. Values above 10 are generally recognized as indicating a
degree of collinearity that needs fixing.
The Main Problem:---
The authors results and conclusions rest on the reliability, unidimensionality, and validity of the
two scales they use. Having explored these scales in considerable detail while preparing this
review I am not convinced by the authors' argument that the scales are sufficiently
unidimensional for mean-scores (that have a clear interpretation) to be formed, and therefore for
the analysis to proceed.
In supporting their argument, the authors cite Wilhelm-Rechmann et al. (2014) [which I was a
coauthor of] and Reise et al. (2010). However, there are fundamental differences between the
arguments of Wilhelm-Rechmann et al. (2014) and the present study, notably: (1) the statistics on
unidimensionality reported by Wilhelm-Rechmann et al. are better than those reported here; (2)
the scale Wilhelm-Rechmann et al. used, the NEP (New Environmental Paradigm) scale, is a
known quantity that has been used in hundreds of studies worldwide with reliable results,
despite showing signs of being weakly multidimensional; (3) five-point items, which the NEP
scale uses, are more likely to give the spurious impression of multidimensionality than three-
point items are; and (4) Wilhelm-Rechmann et al. were able to demonstrate the robustness of their
findings by favourably comparing them with (a) the results of a meta-analysis of 69 studies
spanning 36 nations, and (b) the results of Dunlap et al.'s survey of residents of Washington State
(USA). See Wilhelm-Rechmann et al. (2014) for details. The authors of the present paper
unfortunately do not have access to such "back-stop" studies that might be used to sway the
argument or corroborate their results.
In rejecting the authors' arguments on this fundamentally important question (how much
multidimensionality is too much) I have additionally been swayed by the following facts. In
deciding whether a multidimensional scale is sufficiently unidimensional for analysis to proceed
15
safely, Reise (see the reference list and the help file for Revelle's omega function in R) stresses an
index known as the explained common variance (ECV), which he calls a 'cleaner index of
"undimensionality"' than omega hierarchical (Reise et al. 2010). He and his associates recommend
that this be > 0.70, except if the percentage of uncontaminated correlations (PUC) is high (> 0.80),
in which case an ECV > 0.50 would be acceptable (Reise et al. 2016). When PUC is less than 0.80
then Reise and associates recommend that ECV > 0.60 and that omega hierarchical be > 0.70. Only
then can one be reasonably sure that the presence of some multidimensionality is not severe
enough to disqualify the interpretation of the scale as being primarily unidimensional (Reise et al.
2013).
The problem is that the authors' scales have ECV and PUC values of 0.38/0.36
(Pearson/polychoric correlations) and 0.64/0.55, respectively, for the benefits scale, and ECV and
PUC values of 0.34/0.36 and 0.56/0.56, respectively, for the damage-focused scale. Revelle's beta
coefficient for the two scales is also unacceptably low, being 0.26/0.20 and 0.25/0.07, respectively.
At the very least, it should be > 0.5, and preferably should be > 0.7 (Revelle 1979, Cooksey &
Soutar 2006). In short, there is no evidence to support the authors' view that their scales are
sufficiently unidimensional for them to be treated as if they are unidimensional, and hence for
mean (or summated) scores to have a clear interpretation.
As they stand, the two scales are moderately correlated (r = 0.378). This indicates a degree of
conflation between them, a suspicion that is confirmed by exploratory analysis using tools
designed to select unidimensional scales. Mokken Scale Analysis (R package mokken), for
instance, excludes Q5, Q11, and Q15 from any scale, and puts three items from the scale to asses
damage to the wetland (Q2, Q8, Q16) on the scale to assess benefits from the wetland, and it puts
one item from the scale to assess benefits from the wetland (Q9) on the scale to assess damage to
the wetland. These Mokken-based scales, with mixed questions from the original two scales. have
considerably better statistics on reliability and dimensionality than the scales formed by the
authors; they also are not correlated (r = 0.091).
Using a set of tools that I routinely use, I was able to manually select items from each scale that
are indisputably undimensional, based on the criteria suggested by Reise and associates (op. cit.).
Significantly most of the items that I excluded, viz Q5, Q7, Q9, Q2, Q8, and Q16, are items that the
foregoing exploratory methods either excluded or put on the other scale, viz Q9 on one hand, and
Q2, Q8, and Q16 on the other. The two scales that are formed after these exclusions[*] are not
correlated (r = 0.072) and have omega hierarchical, ECV, and PUC statistics (based on polychoric
correlations) of 0.71, 0.68, and 0.67 for the benefit-scale, and 0.69, 0.63, and 0.53 for the damage-
scale. These are good scale-statistics for data of this type.
[*] Revised benefits scale: [Q1,Q3,Q11,Q13,Q15] (excludes Q5,Q7,Q9); revised damage scale:
[Q4,Q6,Q10,Q12,Q14] (excludes Q2,Q8,Q16).
The foregoing findings mean that were the authors prepared to revise their scales along the lines I
have proposed, there is much that they could rescue from this interesting study (and worthwhile
dataset) and be confident about the findings. There is no reason, I think, why at least some of the
excluded items (i.e. questions), namely those that measure clearly defined activities like grazing
(Q2) and burning (Q8, Q16), could not be used as ancillary variables in supporting analyses. For
instance, they could perhaps be used as predictors in the replacement-analysis I suggest for Table
2. See the expository document/code that I have attached for ideas and supporting proofs.

Detailed Comments:---
Page 2 Line 24: Strictly, "rival" should be "rivalrous." (Or, "resources that rival each other...but are
non-excludable...." Or maybe, "...resources that are rivals...but are non-excludable....")
Page 2 Line 42--43: for [the] ecological functioning. Think you need to add the definite article.
Page 2 Line 43--50: The two "lists" in this paragraph are ambiguous. The "from" that starts the first
list does not apply to all of its elements except if you itemize/enumerate them. If not, then you
should use "from provisioning ecosystem services...from regulating ecosystem service...and from
cultural ecosystem services...." More important is the second list, where there is an unclear
contrast between the first three items and the "or" that separates the last item. Was this really an
17
"either/or" quantification, or do you perhaps mean, "...the grazing, burning, and ploughing
(cultivation) of wetlands, and whether..."? Surely all four activities were quantified?
Page 2 Line 51--52: First instance of "of" should be "on". For the latter, the complete statement
would (and perhaps should) be, "information on the demographic data of respondents."
Page 2 Line 53: You need to state your rationale."The reason for collecting demographic data is
that...."
Page 3 Line 6: "respondents" needs a plural apostrophe (respondents') and a comma after
"community". But the following might be better: "...the questionnaire asked respondents about
their roles in the community, to distinguish...."
Page 3 Line 15: Should be, "The information on...."
Page 3 Line 34--36: Meaning of the last sentence is not clear; presumably it's that, because of the
area's uniqueness, a loss of biodiversity would have a global impact. If so, then try, "..., MAP is
regarded as a geographic[al]* area where a local loss of biodiversity would have a global impact."
[* Note: Figure 1 uses "geographical" not "geographic".]
Page 4 Line 12--13: "..., which we assumed to be an underlying cause..." would be better.
Page 4 Line 24: Need "into Xhosa".
Page 4 Line 37: Possessive case: needs to be, "respondents' demographic variables...."
Page 4 Line 48--49: Incomplete. Try, "The even-numbered questions of Section B were used to
determine [assess] damage-causing activities...."
Page 4 Para beginning Line 50--51: Based on an examination of your code, I don't see that your
description matches what you did. For instance, for the benefits.self ~ benefits.group regression,
the regressor and regressand share two questions (Q5, Q11), the other three being different (so
five questions each); whereas for the damage.self ~ damage.group regression, the regressor and
regressand are each based on four questions (so four questions each), with no shared questions.
Clearly you made a mistake when calculating mean-scores for the benefits.self and benefits.group
subscales. But even then, your description remains confusing and confused. It's clear to me, but
only because I scrutinized your code and the accompanying analyses, that each scale is _based_
on four questions, each of which was asked twice, giving eight sets of answers for each scale, and
a total of 16 sets of answers for the two scales together. It is misleading to say, as you do, that
each question in section B was asked twice, because in the preceding paragraph (Line 41) you say
that "Section B comprised of 16 questions." If each question was asked twice, and there are 16
questions in all, then there should be 32 sets of answers or scores, which there are not. Note also
that sometimes you capitalize "Section B" in mid-sentence and sometimes you don't, writing
"section B."
Page 4 Line 52--53: Leave out "asking."
Page 4 Line 54: Should be "are," not "is" [to see this, leave out "perceived"].
Page 4 Line 56 & Page 5 Line 6--9: See point 2 of my introductory remarks for discussion of the
problems associated with these regressions and with your interpretation of them. Briefly,
addressing just the core problem, you fitted no-intercept models, which fundamentally changes
the interpretation of R^2, the coefficient of determination. Notably, it loses all connexion to the
correlation-based interpretation that you give it. And just as significantly, you omitted to tell the
reader that this is what you did. The R^2 for the intercept-based benefits model is 0.01964, which
is equal to cor(y,x)^2, which in turn is equal to a Pearson correlation of 0.1401. In short, this
means that there is no demonstrable relationship between the two sets of scores, as measured by
Pearson correlation (or, in fact, Spearman/Kendall correlations). Yet R^2 for the no-intercept
version of the model is 0.944. An informed reader, unaware that you've fitted a model without an
intercept (because nowhere do you say that that is what you fitted), would assume that a strong
linear relationship between the two forms of the benefits variable exists (Pearson correlation =
0.972), when in fact this is not so. The same general remarks apply to the other regression. The
results you present in Table 2, and in the second paragraph of Results on pages 5 and 6, are
therefore not only wrong but highly misleading.
18
Page 5 Line 17: Should be "odd- and even-numbered...."
Page 5 Line 32--34: The following is not true: "...every single respondent was Xhosa, meaning that
there was no language variation within the community." Your dataset shows that one respondent
spoke seSotho and one spoke English. They may all have identified themselves as belonging to
the Xhosa people, but that is an essentially different thing.
Page 5 Line 35--37 et seq.: Pairwise correlation is not a recommended/accepted method of testing
for (multi)collinearity. See point 3 of my introductory remarks.
Page 5 Line 36: Should be "correlated with".
Page 5 Line 43--45: Results are selective because there are no grounds on the basis of collinearity
for excluding the predictors you did. Also, you need to tell the reader that the F-values and P-
values you report in Table IV are based on a sequential decomposition of the sums of squares, i.e.
so-called Type I or sequential ANOVA, rather than on Type II or Type III (which here are the
same).
Page 5 Line 51--52: "...and low levels of education..." is better (education is a noun, not an
adjective).
Page 5 Line 52--55: The statistics you report are highly misleading and do not support your
claims. As I've noted above, and in my introductory remarks, R^2 from a no-intercept regression
does not measure association. To get that type of interpretation you need to fit a regression model
with an intercept term. The square-root of the R^2 value from such a regression would indicate
the degree of linear association and for your data is r = 0.140. The R^2 and beta (slope-coefficient)
for the model are 0.020 (r = 0.140 ~= 0.020^.5) and 0.100, respectively.
Page 6 Line 39--43: This is the same issue as that just noted, namely interpreting the statistics from
a no-intercept model as if it's an intercept-based model. Categorically, the R^2 value from a no-
intercept model does not estimate the amount of variance in the response variable explained by
the predictor(s). See point 2 of my introductory comments and the references I cite there. If one
fits a model with an intercept term then the variance in self-reported damage that the model
explains is 36% not 75%, and the slope-coefficient is 0.652 not 0.528. Hence, respondents are not
twice as likely to attribute damage to someone else than to themselves. Pearson's correlation
coefficient is 0.584.
Page 6 Table 2 Caption: Somewhat muddled, and you have written "from from" (repeated).
Maybe try something along the lines of: "Summary statistics from separate linear regressions of
self-reported benefits and self-reported damage on perceived community benefits and perceived
community damage, respectively."
Page 6 Table 2: The statistics you report do not have the interpretation you have given them. As I
have noted above, you interpret these statistics as if you fitted models with an intercept term but
the truth is that you fitted no-intercept models while omitting to say so. Further, for the no-
intercept model for Benefits, the slope-coefficient you report should be 0.883 not 0.880.
Page 6 Line 55--56: "...wetland, results found a positive, statistically significant relationship...."
Results themselves do not find, they suggest or indicate some result or finding. You might say,
"...wetland, we found..." or "...wetland, the results indicate..." or "...wetland, the results support
the finding/fact...."
Page 7 Line 30--32: You fitted an additive model (Table 4, Figure 3), which conditions on, or takes
account of, the effect of other predictors in the model; it does not test whether the effect of self-
reported damage on self-reported benefits (Figure 3-a) depends on values (or levels) of these
other predictors. Hence, you provide no evidence to support your claim that the positive effect of
self-reported damage on self-reported benefits is consistent across age, gender, level of education,
and employment category. To test this, you would need to have fitted a multiplicative model in
which self-reported damage interacted with the other predictors, i.e. a model of the form: benefit
~ damage * (other predictors). If you do this, then your claim indeed holds good; however,
nowhere do you explicitly fit, discuss, or present the results of such a model.

Page 7 Line 34: Residency is not collinear if one uses a reliable test to test collinearity.
Page 7 Line 36--38 & Table 3: I am not convinced by this approach, which strictly speaking is
wrong. The main problem is that you are taking means and standard errors of individual
questions as if each is a continuous variables, which it is not. Each is an ordinal-level variable.
While most authorities consider it to be permissable to take the mean of several ordinal-level
items/questions and to treat the result as a continuous variable, this is not true for the analysis of
individual questions. Each of your questions is an ordered factor with just three levels or
categories (0,1, and 2), i.e. your questions are not an interval- or ratio-scale variables, which
would allow the calculation of such statistics without criticism. The problem is essentially the
same as one I mentioned above: when using Revelle's omega function to calculate statistics on
reliability and dimensionality for your scales (to measure benefits and damage) you used Pearson
correlation (the default) rather than polychoric correlations. See Carifio & Perla (2007), Brown
(2011), and elsewhere on this issue. I also don't think that you have made it clear enough to the
reader that these four activities represent the measurement variables of the scale you used to
measure damage to the wetland, i.e. the eight even-numbered questions of your survey. Finally,
if you were to use this type of approach (but you should not) then you need to use confidence
intervals (bootstrapped) not standard errors. See §3 of my report where I suggest replacement
analyses. For the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests that I carry out there, all you would need are the
estimate of the location shift (Est. = pseudomedian), the associated 95% confidence intervals, and
perhaps p-values (for exact p-values in the presence of ties see wilcoxsign_test() in package coin).
Arguably a more powerful/detailed approach would be to use Cliff's delta statistics. See R
package orddom.
Page 7 Line 36--38: To make this clear, you need to add "self-reported damage" or "Damage-
causing activities" in brackets after "...they partook grazing, ploughing, dumping or burning" so
that there is an explicit link to Table 4/Figure 3-a.
Page 7 Line 38: Preposition missing: usually one "partakes of" or "partook in." But the real
problem here is that it is not the residents/respondents themselves who are doing the grazing, it's
the livestock. You are looking for something simple like, "...was how often they used the wetland
for grazing, ploughing, dumping or burning."
Page 7 §4. Discussion: In light of my foregoing critisms on Method and Interpretation, much of
the Discussion will need to be rewritten. I have therefore reserved comment on this part of the

Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
The study is important as it is from a region with limited literature on community dependence on
wetlands, thus it is an area of interest. However there are certain flaws that cannot be ignored.
Hence this manuscript cannot be published in its present form.
Detailed comments are as:
1. The manuscript needs proper editing.
20
2. Introduction is fluid and lacks conviction
3. The title reads as Ecosystem services and ecological degradation of communal wetlands in a
South African biodiversity hotspot, but the study reported in the manuscript is from a single
village located in the biodiversity hotspot and the study also reflects the results from a single
wetland, hence there is a complete mis-match of the study design and the title.
4. The study area description fails to provide the overview on the area and type of wetland and
the ecosystem services provided therein by the wetland. It is crucial to enumerate few of the
ecosystem services and goods provided by the particular wetland, which is the focus of the study.
5. It will be useful to know the species assemblage in Ward 32 where the study has been
conducted. Particularly interesting will be the name of some endemic species of the region
6. Page 4; Lines 6-8: The authors have mentioned Protected Areas only once in the entire
manuscript. However it will be interesting to know the percentage coverage of the MAP under
protected area network.
7. Page 4; lines 9-10: It will be useful to provide a list of traditional activities carried out by people
in the wetlands.
8. What kind of environment degradation the authors are referring to? The authors need to
specify.
9. Page 4; Lines 15-17: Furthermore, each of the  56% and the youth unemployment ratio
was 61%.
Replace ratio with percent.
10. Page 4: Questionnaire Design
This section needs to be re-written to reflect the variables used, the type of questions used (open-
ended or close-ended). If close ended what was scale used?
Differences between these categories were tested using a repeated measures ANOVA (lme
command in nlme package) followed by a post-hoc multiple comparisons pairwise t-test with
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison
Do the author mean that difference between responses to the ecosystem services were tested? The
authors need to rewrite this section to make the design clear.
Reading the results and specifically Figure 2 show that the authors have tried the t-test between
the two groups of respondents: one which always derived benefits and the other group which
occasionally derives benefits. This analysis doesnt make any sense. What is the scale used in
figure 2 (Y-Axis)? It is unclear.
The methodology is flawed and the authors need to rework on the explanation of questionnaire
design and analysis. I suggest that they refer to some previously published papers on wetland
benefits and community attitude (Ambastha et al., 2008; Hussain and Badola, 2008, 2009; Badola
et al. 2013).
11. Page 9; lines 35-39: The authors have justly used the Ostroms concept of sustainable use in
the discussion but have failed to reflect the same in their methods and results.
21
My overall impression is that the MS needs major revision.

The specific comments to the manuscript are:
This manuscript is about the ecosystem services and ecological degradation of the communal

services to the local community of the study area. The authors have framed this manuscript
around the perceived benefits to self as well as other. But how did the authors choose just a few
of the provisioning (plant and water), regulating (flood and erosion) and cultural services, as
mentioned in the questionnaire design.

leaders (traditional or formal), as in survey design it is mentioned that community survey was
conducted with community members and their leadership.
Is community leader a form of employment? I dont agree.
To know demographic composition, it is advised to refer to the census report for the area, which
will give accurate information on the demographic structure as well as economic and
employment status.
It will be useful to provide a list of traditional activities carried out by people in the wetlands, in
the Study Area section.
Page 4; lines 47-48: According to the IDP [22], the local community has low levels of education,
which we assumed 89 to be an underlying cause of the environmental degradation.
Low level of education doesnt necessarily always results in environment degradation. Moreover,
education doesnt grant the person to be environmentally conscious.

Page 6; lines 53-54: .The multiple regression model showed that male respondents were more

Table 2 shows damage causing activities, whereas the sentence says that male respondents were
more likely to benefit from wetland ecosystem.
The language is lax and needs proper editing for grammatical and syntax errors.

The manuscript studies human-nature interactions using as a case study the ecological systems of
wetlands and a rural community living in a biodiversity hotspot in South Africa as a social
system. Interactions are based on benefits derived from the wetlands (ecosystem services) and
damage-causing activities affecting the wetlands (ecological degradation). It brings to light: i) the
relationship or lack of relationship between damage-causing activities, and benefits, and ii) the
demographical factors that influence above interactions. The insights gained through this study
are valuable as they cover an understudied, yet vulnerable area. However, the paper would
benefit from a restructuring of content around the two enounced research questions. The
manuscript went through the first round of revisions, and I acknowledge a lot of work has been
invested in the statistical analysis, both from reviewers and authors. A general check for the
English language is also recommended. Below are some specific comments.
ABSTRACT
The abstract correctly reflects the content of the paper.
Consider clarifying or separating the following statements for the abstract: Respondents were
more likely to blame others for wetland degradation, although there was no link between the
damage-causing activities and benefits from wetlands. Is this reflected as such in the Results
section?
INTRODUCTION
Lines 6-7: it is not clear how the stated goal This study, therefore, set out to examine whether the
people responsible for degrading wetlands are the same set of people who would benefit the
most from their conservation derives from the previous introductory sentences. Maybe delete
therefore or make the link between motivation and aim clearer. Also, it is less common that the
aim is stated so soon in a flow of a manuscript. Consider moving information about the aim of
this study in the last paragraph of the introduction.
Lines 30-37: parts of this paragraph rather belong to section 2. Methods (a) Study area
Lines 38-65: most parts of these paragraphs rather belong to section 2. Methods (b) and (c)
Line 71: I am not sure social capital is a demographic characteristic. Consider adding whether
demographic characteristics and related social factors such as social capital, 
General comment Introduction: Consider restructuring the introduction so that each paragraph
conveys a (general) message, that only foresees elements of the Discussion without revealing the
results. For example, as a suggestion: a paragraph on wetlands in general, a paragraph on
benefits/ecosystem services from wetlands, a paragraph on threats to wetlands in a certain
context, (research gap), a paragraph on the aim and research questions.

direction: Seven demographic variables were recorded, and six quantified. Language
Lines 174-177: Limitations of the used methods are mentioned.
General comment Methods: Try to make clearer how the three sections of your questionnaire
(lines 109-112) answer your two research questions and/or aim.
Data collection and data analysis are satisfactorily distinguished.
I am not an expert in statistics, but the Methods section might benefit from more structure and
clarity around which methods and tests were chosen to demonstrate what? E.g.: In order to ,
we applied in relation to the first research question.
RESULTS
Line 190: consider rephrasing to someone other than themselves. I remark the point made here
is nicely discussed in the Discussion section (lines 271-281).
Lines 193-194: consider keeping this for discussion only: which is indicative of potential gender-
based power imbalances in the region.
Table 2 caption: consider separating in more sentences. Did the authors explain in the manuscript
what is meant by the F-score?
General comment Results: Try to keep the same structure around the research questions, the
threefold structure of the questionnaire (example: results to the analysis of section A of the
questionnaire covering respondents demographic information actually answer the second
research question, etc.).
DISCUSSION
Lines 231-232: Consider rephrasing and check grammar: Community tend not to self-organise
when natural resources are very abundant or highly depleted [9,28].
Line 238: Consider rephrasing and check grammar: members will not follow rules today when
future outcomes are uncertain.
Line 242 suggestion:  but also of the relationships between different members of the
community and of their nature connectedness.
Line 284: replace doomed to fail
Line 323: suggestion for rephrasing: they tend to attribute lower priority to these issues
compared to technical solutions
Line 325: Consider rephrasing: Specifically, building on our results we make three
recommendations on how to manage the . These are recommendations, or a general roadmap,
as the subtitle suggests, rather than a fully laid out strategy.
General comment Discussion: The discussion is generally well written, and its development is
consistent with the rest of the manuscript, including the abstract: Therefore, we describe how
strong leadership could nurture a sustainable social-ecological system by integrating ecological
information and social empowerment into a multi-level governance system.

GENERAL COMMENTS
I must preface my review by noting that I am not experienced in questionnaire surveys and their
analysis and interpretation, and therefore I am very limited in terms of commenting on any
methodological issues in the paper. Instead I comment mainly from the perspective of my
experience in assessing wetland ecological degradation and ecosystem services provision.
The manuscript addresses a relevant and important topic for which there has not been much
research conducted in South Africa. From my perspective (and with my limitations in terms of
questionnaire surveys) the study appears to be generally scientifically sound, well conceptualized
and implemented, and well presented, and makes a useful scientific contribution with practical
application. However, there are three important general issues which should be addressed, as
well a few specific issues which require attention, which are given below.
Elaboration on damage to wetlands and the basis on which specific activities are deemed to be
damaging or not:
Although the paper identifies four damage-causing activities fairly early on in the paper
(Grazing, Ploughing, Dumping and Burning) it lacks any specific indication of what is meant by
damage to wetlands and the basis on which specific activities are deemed to be damaging or not.
It is important that this be done given that damage-causing activities are a central focus of the
paper. The implication seems to be that all of the four listed uses are inherently damaging, and
while this probably stands for ploughing and dumping, it is more nuanced for grazing and
burning. Wetlands over much of South Africa, and probably in the study area, evolved under
fire and indigenous grazers (e.g. buffalo) (Fynn et al. 2015 and Kotze 2013) and where large
grazers such as buffalo are no longer present in an area then domestic livestock can to fair degree
30
replace their effect. The damage resulting from fire and grazing relates to the specifics of the
grazing/burning regime, e.g. from annual fires or prolonged intense grazing.
Fynn RWS, Murray-Hudson M, Dhliwayo M, Scholte P, 2015. African wetlands and their seasonal
use by wild and domestic herbivores. Wetlands, Ecology and Management 23:559581
Kotze D C, 2013. The effects of fire on wetland structure and functioning. African Journal of
Aquatic Science 38: 237247
A greater depth of reporting on the different wetland uses/benefits:
A greater depth of reporting is required on the different uses made of the wetlands in the study
area, the compatibility/incompatibility of these respective uses and how demographics (in
particular gender) may be specific to particular uses. This would help given the reader more
insights into some of the key findings reported in the paper, e.g. that males were more likely to
benefit from the wetland than females.
Also see specific comments on Page 7, Figure 3.
Reporting on collective choice rules for wetlands in the study area:
The paper makes several general references to collective choice rules and has a sub-section in the
discussion on Governance. One would therefore anticipate that some specifics on these rules
would be reported on for wetlands in the study area. But this seems to be entirely missing.
While acknowledging that this was not the focus of the questionnaire, it is relevant to the study
objectives and deserves some attention, even if it is that no collective choice rules for wetlands in
the study area appear to exist.
SPECIFIC COMMENTS
Abstract, However, wetlands are often on communal land and face degradation by individuals
who maximise their personal benefit from ecosystem services without bearing the full
environmental costs of their actions.
I suggest deleting this sentence, which is general and I am also not sure fully substantiated. This
would provide more words available in the Abstract for the authors to report on an additional
specific finding of the research in place of this general statement.
Page 2, line 15-17, Common-pool resources are resources that are rival (i.e. 16 using the
resources reduces its availability to other users), but non-excludable (i.e. one cannot 17 restrict
access to these resources)
It is not necessarily so that common-pool resources are non-excludable, as in fact is identified in
the following paragraphs reference to collective choice rules (which may include exclusions).
Page 3, line 72, These wetlands are.prone to degradation caused by man-made activities. /A
few words indicating why they are prone to such degradation would be useful
Page 4 line 100-104. (2) how often respondents partook in the most common damage-causing
activities to1 wetlands (identified during prior site visits)
A few words should be added in terms of what was carried out in the prior site visits. As it
stands, this is not clear.
Page 6, line 189, Notably, respondents who were more likely to partake in grazing, ploughing,
dumping or burning did not stand to benefit any more from wetland ecosystem services than
their peers. Sorry this is a little unclear. Are the peers being referred to here not likely to
partake in grazing, ploughing, dumping or burning? This should be clarified.

the specific services within the three broad categories reported in /Figure 3, namely provisioning,
regulating and cultural services. As it stands I cannot see it reported anywhere in the paper.
Page 8, line 193, This study showed that all community members benefited from ecosystem
services from wetlands in the Hlabathi administrative area, South Africa, This statement could
be better substantiated through more specific reporting.
Page 8, line 193-195, This study showed that all community members benefited from ecosystem
services from wetlands in the Hlabathi administrative area, South Africa, but men tended to
benefit more than women. This statement needs to be substantiated and elaborated on with
more specific reporting, in particular giving the reader a better sense of which of the specific
services this applied to, thereby helping the reader to better understand why men tended to
benefit more than women.
Page 8, line 197-199, Moreover, there was no evidence that the men and women who degraded
wetlands gained more from wetland ecosystem services than their fellow community members.
More information is required in terms of what constitutes someone who degraded wetlands. See
General comments.
Page 8, line 216: I am not sure that seasonal grazing is a good example of a resource which is
mobile, which seems to be implied.
Page 9 line 218-219, However, the productivity and predictability of these ecosystems might be
potential obstacles to their sustainable use. This statement needs to be better elaborated upon,
e.g. productivity and predictability in terms of what?
Page 9 line 242-244, Community members have a shared interest in preserving wetland systems,
which frees them from the conflict caused by different land-use pressures (e.g. [35,36]). Sorry, it
is unclear to me while a general shared interest in preserving wetlands should free community
members from conflict caused by different land-use pressures. I can appreciate how a shared
interest could help in resolving conflicts, but it seems unrealistic that it would free users from
conflicts.
Paqe 9 line 248, Gender is an important determinant of pro-environmental behaviour Some
elaboration of why this should be so would be useful. In addition, what would constitute pro-
environmental behaviour?
Page 10 line 279, The final predictor of sustainable use of common-pool resources is good
governance structures with collective choice rules As elaborated on in the General comments,
the paper provides important general statements such as this but seems to be lacking in terms of
reporting on the specifics of any collective choice rules for use of the wetlands in the study area.
Page 10 line 286, This is not because respondents are generally selfish or have negative
perceptions of nature. On the contrary, respondents were Xhosa, a cultural group that has been
shown previously to score highly on various measures of nature connectedness [27,39]. Such
human-biosphere connectedness is central to sustainable use of ecosystems and resilient social-
ecological systems [48,49]. Some of the assumptions in these statements are potentially
problematic, in particular what appears to be an assumed overriding influence that so-called
nature connectedness might have over immediate self interests.
32
Page 10 line 292, It is possible that communicating scientific information to traditional
leadership structures could establish sustainable practices throughout the wider community.
What appears to be the implicit assumption here may often not hold that altered
awareness/perceptions will necessarily lead to altered practices.
Page 10 line 299 Instead, it needs to be embedded into a multi-level governance structure (e.g.
[52]) that includes national initiatives, like the Working for Wetlands expanded public works
programme I am not sure that a public works programme is the best example to give for a
natural resources governance structure.

Comments to the Author(s)
GENERAL COMMENTS
I must preface my review by noting that I am not experienced in questionnaire surveys and their
analysis and interpretation, and therefore I am very limited in terms of commenting on any
methodological issues in the paper. Instead I comment mainly from the perspective of my
experience in assessing wetland ecological degradation and ecosystem services provision.
The manuscript addresses a relevant and important topic for which there has not been much
research conducted in South Africa. From my perspective (and with my limitations in terms of
questionnaire surveys) the study appears to be generally scientifically sound, well conceptualized
and implemented, and well presented, and makes a useful scientific contribution with practical
application. However, there are three important general issues which should be addressed, as
well a few specific issues which require attention, which are given below.
Elaboration on damage to wetlands and the basis on which specific activities are deemed to be
damaging or not:
Although the paper identifies four damage-causing activities fairly early on in the paper
(Grazing, Ploughing, Dumping and Burning) it lacks any specific indication of what is meant by
damage to wetlands and the basis on which specific activities are deemed to be damaging or not.
It is important that this be done given that damage-causing activities are a central focus of the
paper. The implication seems to be that all of the four listed uses are inherently damaging, and
while this probably stands for ploughing and dumping, it is more nuanced for grazing and
burning. Wetlands over much of South Africa, and probably in the study area, evolved under
fire and indigenous grazers (e.g. buffalo) (Fynn et al. 2015 and Kotze 2013) and where large
grazers such as buffalo are no longer present in an area then domestic livestock can to fair degree
replace their effect. The damage resulting from fire and grazing relates to the specifics of the
grazing/burning regime, e.g. from annual fires or prolonged intense grazing.
Fynn RWS, Murray-Hudson M, Dhliwayo M, Scholte P, 2015. African wetlands and their seasonal
use by wild and domestic herbivores. Wetlands, Ecology and Management 23:559581
Kotze D C, 2013. The effects of fire on wetland structure and functioning. African Journal of
Aquatic Science 38: 237247
A greater depth of reporting on the different wetland uses/benefits:
A greater depth of reporting is required on the different uses made of the wetlands in the study
area, the compatibility/incompatibility of these respective uses and how demographics (in
particular gender) may be specific to particular uses. This would help given the reader more
insights into some of the key findings reported in the paper, e.g. that males were more likely to
benefit from the wetland than females.
Also see specific comments on Page 7, Figure 3.
36
Reporting on collective choice rules for wetlands in the study area:
The paper makes several general references to collective choice rules and has a sub-section in the
discussion on Governance. One would therefore anticipate that some specifics on these rules
would be reported on for wetlands in the study area. But this seems to be entirely missing.
While acknowledging that this was not the focus of the questionnaire, it is relevant to the study
objectives and deserves some attention, even if it is that no collective choice rules for wetlands in
the study area appear to exist.
SPECIFIC COMMENTS
Abstract, However, wetlands are often on communal land and face degradation by individuals
who maximise their personal benefit from ecosystem services without bearing the full
environmental costs of their actions.
I suggest deleting this sentence, which is general and I am also not sure fully substantiated. This
would provide more words available in the Abstract for the authors to report on an additional
specific finding of the research in place of this general statement.
Page 2, line 15-17, Common-pool resources are resources that are rival (i.e. 16 using the
resources reduces its availability to other users), but non-excludable (i.e. one cannot 17 restrict
access to these resources)
It is not necessarily so that common-pool resources are non-excludable, as in fact is identified in
the following paragraphs reference to collective choice rules (which may include exclusions).
Page 3, line 72, These wetlands are.prone to degradation caused by man-made activities. /A
few words indicating why they are prone to such degradation would be useful
Page 4 line 100-104. (2) how often respondents partook in the most common damage-causing
activities to1 wetlands (identified during prior site visits)
A few words should be added in terms of what was carried out in the prior site visits. As it
stands, this is not clear.
Page 6, line 189, Notably, respondents who were more likely to partake in grazing, ploughing,
dumping or burning did not stand to benefit any more from wetland ecosystem services than
their peers. Sorry this is a little unclear. Are the peers being referred to here not likely to
partake in grazing, ploughing, dumping or burning? This should be clarified.
Page 7, para 1: perceive group should read perceived group

What follows is a point-by-point reply to the reviewers comments.
######################################
Subject Editor Comments to Author:
One reviewer was positive but offered no substantial comments. The other two reviewers found severe
problems which in their views would prevent publication of the manuscript. We will allow a resubmission,
if the authors choose, but only if all the criticisms of the referees are adequately assessed, which may
take considerable additional work. Thanks for submitting here and good luck.
#####################################
Reply 1: Thank you and the three reviewers for the constructive feedback on this manuscript. We have
carried out considerable revisions based on the feedback, which we highlight in yellow for ease of
reference. In instances where we followed the reviewers suggestions fully, we list the line number of
these changes in our replies to each of their remarks. When we did not incorporate their feedback, we
explain in this letter why their advice is not reflected in our revised manuscript.
Briefly, we have implemented the analyses suggested by Reviewer 1, which changed our conclusions
somewhat. The new analyses demonstrate that the only significant explanatory variable for benefits
from wetland ecosystem services is the gender of the respondent (males report more benefits than
females). This change has mean that the abstract and discussion sections had to be modified. Besides
this major change, the other alternations to the manuscript were intended to add clarity, context or
additional information to the original submission, which improves the readability, but does not change
the main take-home messages.
#####################################
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Overview:---
This is a relatively well written paper that presents the results of a study of wetland-use by a community
living in an ecologically sensitive part of South Africa. The dataset on which the results are based is
valuable, and the results of the study are likely to be of some interest even to a general audience.
Publication of the paper in its present form cannot however be recommended because (1) inappropriate
methods have been used for some of the analyses; (2) the results of some of the analyses are
incorrectly interpreted; and (3) the scales that have been used to measure benefit from and damage to
wetlands are insufficiently unidimensional, and to some extent are conflated (they partly measure each
other). Once these problems have been fixed, and parts of the paper rethought, I think that the results
would be worth publishing.
Below I briefly review the main problems I identified, beginning with a set of lesser problems. In the last
part of my review, under the head Detailed Comments, I address these and other issues in greater detail
and more directly, on a line-by-line basis. I have also attached a report in which I provide further proofs
of most of the key issues and code to support the alternative analyses that I propose.
#####################################
Reply 2: We would like to thank Reviewer 1 for the incredibly detailed review; it was the most thorough
evaluation of research we have experienced so far. We have tried to incorporate as much of the
feedback as possible, but we had to make some necessary trade-offs because, as we are sure the
reviewer will acknowledge, statistical analyses are rarely perfect and require compromises on the the
underlying assumptions. Most notable, we still analysed the data using OLS regression, because we are
of the view that the benefits of including multiple explanatory variable outweight the negatives of
treating survey-based responses as continuous variables.
#####################################
Relatively Minor, but Nonetheless Important Problems Are:---
1) The authors treat the individual items of each scale, i.e. the 16 questions of their survey, as if they
are interval- or ratio-level variables, i.e. continuous variables. However, each question is an ordinal-level
variable (an ordered factor) with just three categories (Never, Sometimes, Always). This affects their
calculation of statistics on the reliability, validity, and dimensionality of each scale, where Pearson
correlations are used. Polychoric correlations should have been used instead. Revelle's omega function,
which the authors used to calculate these statistics, uses Pearson correlations by default, but there is an
argument to that function that allows polychoric correlations to be used (in the event that scale items
have fewer than ~ seven categories or levels). Incorrectly treating individual items as if they are
continuous variables also affects the results reported in Table 3, where the means and standard errors of
individual questions are calculated and reported. In my Detailed Comments I propose a replacement
analysis, which I flesh out in my attached report. Good options are to use Wilcoxon signed-rank tests or
Cliff's delta statistics (R package orddom). See Carifio & Perla (2007) and Brown (2011) for notes on the
distinction between the items of a scale and the scale itself, and what the acceptable numerical
treatment of each is. Also see Cliff (1993, 1996).
#####################################
Reply 3: We have followed this suggestion and have changed our analyses to non-parametric
equivalents. As suggested, we now used a Wilcoxon test to compare self-reported and perceived group
benefits from and damage to wetlands (lines 134-137). Furthermore, to compare different types of
ecosystem services (Figure 3), we use a Friedman test, with appropriate post-hoc tests, which is the
non-parametric equivalent of a repeated measures anova (explained in lines 120-127).
With reference to our original Table 3 (an overview of the different types of damage-causing activities):
this has been removed from our revised manuscript because it contained information non-essential to
our main discussion. Thus, the problems pointed out by the reviewer does not apply to this revised
manuscript.
#####################################
2) The authors fit no-intercept regressions (but do not tell the reader); the results are reported in Table
2. They then make the mistake of interpreting the statistics that result from those regressions as if they
derive from regressions that were fitted with an intercept term. R^2 (coefficient of determination)
values from intercept- and no-intercept regressions have fundamentally different interpretations (true
for all reputable statistical software programs). Notably, the R^2 value from a no-intercept regression
does not represent the amount of variance of the regressand (response) that the regressor (predictor)
explains; it also does not represent the extent to which the regressand and the regressor are associated.
This is relatively easy to demonstrate. The Pearson correlation coefficient (measures linear association)
between the regressor and the regressand of the first regression listed in Table 2 (Benefits from
wetlands) is 0.140. If we square this we get the R^2 for an ordinary least-squares model fitted with an
intercept term, which is 0.020, compared to 0.944 for the no-intercept regression. Given that the
accepted interpretation of models fitted with an intercept term represents the proportion of variance in
the response variable that the predictor explains (here ~ 2% compared to ~ 94% for the no-intercept
regression), R^2 values from no-intercept models cannot, ipso facto, have the same interpretation but
must have a wholly different one. The R^2 value from a no-intercept regression in fact measures the
proportion of the variability _about the origin_ that the regression explains, and not the proportion of
variability of the response variable as a whole, or around the grand mean, that the regression explains.
See Hocking (1996) and Eisenhauer (2003) and elsewhere.
Additionally, the estimated slope-coefficients of no-intercept models depend on the strong theoretical
assumption that the expected value of the response variable is zero when the value of the predictor
variable is zero. The authors provide no evidence to support such a claim, which, indeed, seems to be
part of what they are trying prove. For the first regression reported in Table 2, the slope coefficient for
an intercept-based regression is 0.10 not 0.88. It might also be noted that the estimates reported for
the first regression (Benefits from wetlands) are in any case wrong because the authors mistakenly
included two questions, viz Q5 and Q11, in both the regressor and the regressand when calculating the
mean-scores of sub-scales that they use in the regression.
While it might be of some interest to know how the two subscales of each scale relate to each other (i.e.
how the self-assessed and perceived-group effects relate to each other), this type of analysis should not
be necessary if the main scales are sharpened (or refined) to be truly unidimensional. The authors would
probably be better off carrying out some form of agreement/concordance analysis, though Lin`s
concordance correlation coefficient (Lin 1989; Lin et al. 2002) is probably too exacting. Bland-Altman
(i.e. Tukey's mean-difference) plots, coupled with paired t-tests or a non-parametric or Bayesian
alternative, would probably be adequate. See the R packages granovaGG (function granovagg.ds),
epiTools, MethComp, Agreement, amongst others.
#####################################
Reply 4: We agree that our original analysis was crude and have implemented his proposed
improvements. We used dependent sample assessment plots (new Figure 2 using the granovagg.ds
command as suggested: line 137-138) in combination with Wilcoxon non-parametric tests (lines 134-
137) as suggested to compare self- and group-reported benefits and damages to wetlands. We are
pleased that this improved analysis supported our original conclusions  that respondents underestimate
their own damage to wetlands, but accurately assess the benefits they gain  in a way that will be
clearer to the readers. This new analysis enhances this revised manuscript.
We have also corrected the mistake of including two questions on both the regressor and regressed
scales (see R-scripts on Github). Futhermore, we refined the two scales and ensured that they are
indeed unidimensional as outlined in lines 148-160 (we elaborate on this process in a reply below).
#####################################
This brings me to a final issue under this head. Ordinary least-squares regression is not appropriate
when both the regressor and the regressand are measured with approximately the same degree of error,
as they are here. The methods I have just referred to, viz agreement/concordance analysis, use major-
axis (or Deming) regression as a central tool. It is the appropriate type of regression to use when
regressing one psychometric or survey-based scale on another one. See R packages lmodel2 and smatr
and references therein.
#####################################
Reply 5: We appreciate this comment by the referee, but, regrettably, we unable to implement the
suggestion. To our understanding, major-axis regression (in packages lmodel2 and smatr) can only be
used for univariate regression. Since it was important that we incorporated both continuous and
categorical demographic explanatory variable in our model (Table 2), we could not use the more robust
major-axis regression. Instead, we chose to stick with the OLS regression. While this is not ideal, as the
reviewer points out, we feel it is an acceptable compromise. In our model outputs (Table 2), only one
explanatory variable is statistically significant (Gender, P = 0.005) and its P-value is safely below the
conventional threshold of alpha = 0.05. Even though OLS regression might be biased, we argue that this
bias is an acceptable compromise to ensure that we can model all demographic variables
simultaneously. This is included in lines 175-178.
#####################################
3) The authors use pairwise correlations to assess the collinearity of putative predictors for the model
they summarize in Figure 3 and Table 4. Pairwise correlations are neither an appropriate nor a
recommended way of assessing collinearity, and do not provide grounds for excluding variables from the
model. The reason of this is that collinearity depends on jointly assessing all the predictors in the model.
Recommended approaches rely on (generalized) variance-inflation factors and condition indices of the
design matrix (Belsley et al. 1980 [2004]). See vif() in Fox's car package for R, and ols_coll_diag() in
Hebbali's olsrr package for R.
Were the authors to use these methods to test for collinearity they would find that neither of the two
variables they exclude come close to showing signs of being collinear with other variables. In fact, the
most collinear putative predictor is Position (role played in the community), which has a generalized
variance-inflation factor of 2.64. This is well below the recommended value of >4, which is when one
begins to suspect that there might be a sufficient degree of collinearity to begin to affect parameter
estimates. Values above 10 are generally recognized as indicating a degree of collinearity that needs
fixing.
#####################################
Reply 6: We agree with the reviewer on this point that the variance inflation factors are not high enough
to imply collinearity in predictor variables. We have, therefore, included all the demographic variable in
our regression model (see lines 171-173), outputs from which are included in Table 2.
#####################################
The Main Problem:---
The authors results and conclusions rest on the reliability, unidimensionality, and validity of the two
scales they use. Having explored these scales in considerable detail while preparing this review I am not
convinced by the authors' argument that the scales are sufficiently unidimensional for mean-scores (that
have a clear interpretation) to be formed, and therefore for the analysis to proceed.
In supporting their argument, the authors cite Wilhelm-Rechmann et al. (2014) [which I was a coauthor
of] and Reise et al. (2010). However, there are fundamental differences between the arguments of
Wilhelm-Rechmann et al. (2014) and the present study, notably: (1) the statistics on unidimensionality
reported by Wilhelm-Rechmann et al. are better than those reported here; (2) the scale Wilhelm-
Rechmann et al. used, the NEP (New Environmental Paradigm) scale, is a known quantity that has been
used in hundreds of studies worldwide with reliable results, despite showing signs of being weakly
multidimensional; (3) five-point items, which the NEP scale uses, are more likely to give the spurious
impression of multidimensionality than three-point items are; and (4) Wilhelm-Rechmann et al. were
able to demonstrate the robustness of their findings by favourably comparing them with (a) the results
of a meta-analysis of 69 studies spanning 36 nations, and (b) the results of Dunlap et al.'s survey of
residents of Washington State (USA). See Wilhelm-Rechmann et al. (2014) for details. The authors of
the present paper unfortunately do not have access to such "back-stop" studies that might be used to
sway the argument or corroborate their results.
In rejecting the authors' arguments on this fundamentally important question (how much
multidimensionality is too much) I have additionally been swayed by the following facts. In deciding
whether a multidimensional scale is sufficiently unidimensional for analysis to proceed safely, Reise (see
the reference list and the help file for Revelle's omega function in R) stresses an index known as the
explained common variance (ECV), which he calls a 'cleaner index of "undimensionality"' than omega
hierarchical (Reise et al. 2010). He and his associates recommend that this be > 0.70, except if the
percentage of uncontaminated correlations (PUC) is high (> 0.80), in which case an ECV > 0.50 would
be acceptable (Reise et al. 2016). When PUC is less than 0.80 then Reise and associates recommend
that ECV > 0.60 and that omega hierarchical be > 0.70. Only then can one be reasonably sure that the
presence of some multidimensionality is not severe enough to disqualify the interpretation of the scale
as being primarily unidimensional (Reise et al. 2013).
The problem is that the authors' scales have ECV and PUC values of 0.38/0.36 (Pearson/polychoric
correlations) and 0.64/0.55, respectively, for the benefits scale, and ECV and PUC values of 0.34/0.36
and 0.56/0.56, respectively, for the damage-focused scale. Revelle's beta coefficient for the two scales
is also unacceptably low, being 0.26/0.20 and 0.25/0.07, respectively. At the very least, it should be >
0.5, and preferably should be > 0.7 (Revelle 1979, Cooksey & Soutar 2006). In short, there is no
evidence to support the authors' view that their scales are sufficiently unidimensional for them to be
treated as if they are unidimensional, and hence for mean (or summated) scores to have a clear
interpretation.
As they stand, the two scales are moderately correlated (r = 0.378). This indicates a degree of
conflation between them, a suspicion that is confirmed by exploratory analysis using tools designed to
select unidimensional scales. Mokken Scale Analysis (R package mokken), for instance, excludes Q5,
Q11, and Q15 from any scale, and puts three items from the scale to asses damage to the wetland (Q2,
Q8, Q16) on the scale to assess benefits from the wetland, and it puts one item from the scale to assess
benefits from the wetland (Q9) on the scale to assess damage to the wetland. These Mokken-based
scales, with mixed questions from the original two scales. have considerably better statistics on
reliability and dimensionality than the scales formed by the authors; they also are not correlated (r =
0.091).
Using a set of tools that I routinely use, I was able to manually select items from each scale that are
indisputably undimensional, based on the criteria suggested by Reise and associates (op. cit.).
Significantly most of the items that I excluded, viz Q5, Q7, Q9, Q2, Q8, and Q16, are items that the
foregoing exploratory methods either excluded or put on the other scale, viz Q9 on one hand, and Q2,
Q8, and Q16 on the other. The two scales that are formed after these exclusions[*] are not correlated (r
= 0.072) and have omega hierarchical, ECV, and PUC statistics (based on polychoric correlations) of
0.71, 0.68, and 0.67 for the benefit-scale, and 0.69, 0.63, and 0.53 for the damage-scale. These are
good scale-statistics for data of this type.
[*] Revised benefits scale: [Q1,Q3,Q11,Q13,Q15] (excludes Q5,Q7,Q9); revised damage scale:
[Q4,Q6,Q10,Q12,Q14] (excludes Q2,Q8,Q16).
The foregoing findings mean that were the authors prepared to revise their scales along the lines I have
proposed, there is much that they could rescue from this interesting study (and worthwhile dataset) and
be confident about the findings. There is no reason, I think, why at least some of the excluded items
(i.e. questions), namely those that measure clearly defined activities like grazing (Q2) and burning (Q8,
Q16), could not be used as ancillary variables in supporting analyses. For instance, they could perhaps
be used as predictors in the replacement-analysis I suggest for Table 2. See the expository
document/code that I have attached for ideas and supporting proofs.

Reply 7: We would like to thank the reviewer for this suggestion and especially for the thorough
supplementary notes he provided. We would not have been able to implement these suggestion without
the step-by-step guidance in the form of annotated R-scripts. We are very grateful for this assistance.
There is little to reply other than we have implemented this suggestion exactly as the reviewer outlined.
It is mentioned briefly in lines 148-160, but it was not possible for use to include as much elaborate
discussion in the manuscript as provided here. Nevertheless, the new scale used in this revision are the
same as the ones proposed by the referee,and we used the same metrics of unidimensionality
(Cronbachs alpha, Hierarchical Omega and explained common variance, ECV) and came to the
estimates for these metrics. Thus, we are confident that our revised scales are more accurates, thanks
to the reviewers helpful feedback. Moreover, we use these grouping of questions in other analyses used
for Figure 2).

Page 2 Line 43--50: The two "lists" in this paragraph are ambiguous. The "from" that starts the first list
does not apply to all of its elements except if you itemize/enumerate them. If not, then you should use
"from provisioning ecosystem services...from regulating ecosystem service...and from cultural
ecosystem services...." More important is the second list, where there is an unclear contrast between
the first three items and the "or" that separates the last item. Was this really an "either/or"

wetlands, and whether..."? Surely all four activities were quantified?

Page 4 Para beginning Line 50--51: Based on an examination of your code, I don't see that your
description matches what you did. For instance, for the benefits.self ~ benefits.group regression, the
regressor and regressand share two questions (Q5, Q11), the other three being different (so five
questions each); whereas for the damage.self ~ damage.group regression, the regressor and regressand
are each based on four questions (so four questions each), with no shared questions. Clearly you made
a mistake when calculating mean-scores for the benefits.self and benefits.group subscales. But even
then, your description remains confusing and confused. It's clear to me, but only because I scrutinized
your code and the accompanying analyses, that each scale is _based_ on four questions, each of which
was asked twice, giving eight sets of answers for each scale, and a total of 16 sets of answers for the
two scales together. It is misleading to say, as you do, that each question in section B was asked twice,
because in the preceding paragraph (Line 41) you say that "Section B comprised of 16 questions." If
each question was asked twice, and there are 16 questions in all, then there should be 32 sets of
answers or scores, which there are not. Note also that sometimes you capitalize "Section B" in mid-
sentence and sometimes you don't, writing "section B."

#####################################
Page 4 Line 56 & Page 5 Line 6--9: See point 2 of my introductory remarks for discussion of the
problems associated with these regressions and with your interpretation of them. Briefly, addressing just
the core problem, you fitted no-intercept models, which fundamentally changes the interpretation of
R^2, the coefficient of determination. Notably, it loses all connexion to the correlation-based
interpretation that you give it. And just as significantly, you omitted to tell the reader that this is what
you did. The R^2 for the intercept-based benefits model is 0.01964, which is equal to cor(y,x)^2, which
in turn is equal to a Pearson correlation of 0.1401. In short, this means that there is no demonstrable
relationship between the two sets of scores, as measured by Pearson correlation (or, in fact,
Spearman/Kendall correlations). Yet R^2 for the no-intercept version of the model is 0.944. An informed
reader, unaware that you've fitted a model without an intercept (because nowhere do you say that that
is what you fitted), would assume that a strong linear relationship between the two forms of the benefits
variable exists (Pearson correlation = 0.972), when in fact this is not so. The same general remarks
apply to the other regression. The results you present in Table 2, and in the second paragraph of Results
on pages 5 and 6, are therefore not only wrong but highly misleading.

or sequential ANOVA, rather than on Type II or Type III (which here are the same).

#####################################
Reply 14: Corrected and highlighted in the text.
#####################################
Page 5 Line 52--55: The statistics you report are highly misleading and do not support your claims. As
I've noted above, and in my introductory remarks, R^2 from a no-intercept regression does not
measure association. To get that type of interpretation you need to fit a regression model with an
intercept term. The square-root of the R^2 value from such a regression would indicate the degree of
linear association and for your data is r = 0.140. The R^2 and beta (slope-coefficient) for the model are
0.020 (r = 0.140 ~= 0.020^.5) and 0.100, respectively.
Page 6 Line 39--43: This is the same issue as that just noted, namely interpreting the statistics from a
no-intercept model as if it's an intercept-based model. Categorically, the R^2 value from a no-intercept
model does not estimate the amount of variance in the response variable explained by the predictor(s).
See point 2 of my introductory comments and the references I cite there. If one fits a model with an
intercept term then the variance in self-reported damage that the model explains is 36% not 75%, and
the slope-coefficient is 0.652 not 0.528. Hence, respondents are not twice as likely to attribute damage
to someone else than to themselves. Pearson's correlation coefficient is 0.584.
Page 6 Table 2 Caption: Somewhat muddled, and you have written "from from" (repeated). Maybe try
something along the lines of: "Summary statistics from separate linear regressions of self-reported
benefits and self-reported damage on perceived community benefits and perceived community damage,
respectively."
Page 6 Table 2: The statistics you report do not have the interpretation you have given them. As I have
noted above, you interpret these statistics as if you fitted models with an intercept term but the truth is
that you fitted no-intercept models while omitting to say so. Further, for the no-intercept model for
Benefits, the slope-coefficient you report should be 0.883 not 0.880.
Page 6 Line 55--56: "...wetland, results found a positive, statistically significant relationship...." Results
themselves do not find, they suggest or indicate some result or finding. You might say, "...wetland, we
found..." or "...wetland, the results indicate..." or "...wetland, the results support the finding/fact."
Page 7 Line 30--32: You fitted an additive model (Table 4, Figure 3), which conditions on, or takes
account of, the effect of other predictors in the model; it does not test whether the effect of self-
reported damage on self-reported benefits (Figure 3-a) depends on values (or levels) of these other
predictors. Hence, you provide no evidence to support your claim that the positive effect of self-reported
damage on self-reported benefits is consistent across age, gender, level of education, and employment
category. To test this, you would need to have fitted a multiplicative model in which self-reported
damage interacted with the other predictors, i.e. a model of the form: benefit ~ damage * (other
predictors). If you do this, then your claim indeed holds good; however, nowhere do you explicitly fit,
discuss, or present the results of such a model.
Page 7 Line 34: Residency is not collinear if one uses a reliable test to test collinearity.
Page 7 Line 36--38 & Table 3: I am not convinced by this approach, which strictly speaking is wrong.
The main problem is that you are taking means and standard errors of individual questions as if each is
a continuous variables, which it is not. Each is an ordinal-level variable. While most authorities consider
it to be permissable to take the mean of several ordinal-level items/questions and to treat the result as
a continuous variable, this is not true for the analysis of individual questions. Each of your questions is
an ordered factor with just three levels or categories (0,1, and 2), i.e. your questions are not an
interval- or ratio-scale variables, which would allow the calculation of such statistics without criticism.
The problem is essentially the same as one I mentioned above: when using Revelle's omega function to
calculate statistics on reliability and dimensionality for your scales (to measure benefits and damage)
you used Pearson correlation (the default) rather than polychoric correlations. See Carifio & Perla
(2007), Brown (2011), and elsewhere on this issue. I also don't think that you have made it clear
enough to the reader that these four activities represent the measurement variables of the scale you
used to measure damage to the wetland, i.e. the eight even-numbered questions of your survey. Finally,
if you were to use this type of approach (but you should not) then you need to use confidence intervals
(bootstrapped) not standard errors. See §3 of my report where I suggest replacement analyses. For the
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests that I carry out there, all you would need are the estimate of the location
shift (Est. = pseudomedian), the associated 95% confidence intervals, and perhaps p-values (for exact
p-values in the presence of ties see wilcoxsign_test() in package coin). Arguably a more
powerful/detailed approach would be to use Cliff's delta statistics. See R package orddom.
Page 7 Line 36--38: To make this clear, you need to add "self-reported damage" or "Damage-causing
activities" in brackets after "...they partook grazing, ploughing, dumping or burning" so that there is an
explicit link to Table 4/Figure 3-a.
Page 7 Line 38: Preposition missing: usually one "partakes of" or "partook in." But the real problem here
is that it is not the residents/respondents themselves who are doing the grazing, it's the livestock. You
are looking for something simple like, "...was how often they used the wetland for grazing, ploughing,
dumping or burning."

Comments to the Author(s)
The study is important as it is from a region with limited literature on community dependence on
wetlands, thus it is an area of interest. However there are certain flaws that cannot be ignored. Hence
this manuscript cannot be published in its present form.
Detailed comments are as:
1. The manuscript needs proper editing.
2. Introduction is fluid and lacks conviction

#####################################
3. The title reads as Ecosystem services and ecological degradation of communal wetlands in a South
African biodiversity hotspot, but the study reported in the manuscript is from a single village located in
the biodiversity hotspot and the study also reflects the results from a single wetland, hence there is a
complete mis-match of the study design and the title.
#####################################
Reply 17: We did not change the title of this revised manuscript because it does reflect the scope of the
study, which is the ecosystem service and ecological degradation. Moreover, the abstract makes it clear
that it is a survey of 50 households from a single administrative area. It should be noted, however, that
the region does not contain only one wetland. Instead, the national wetland database identifies 231
wetlands in the administrative area. Unfortunately, there are known errors in this data base, so we
revised the section on the study area to make it clear that there are more than 200 wetlands in the
region.
#####################################
4. The study area description fails to provide the overview on the area and type of wetland and the
ecosystem services provided therein by the wetland. It is crucial to enumerate few of the ecosystem
services and goods provided by the particular wetland, which is the focus of the study.
#####################################
Reply 18: Since it was not the intention of this manuscript to conduct an ecosystem services assessment
(but rather to evaluate the self-reported benefits from wetlands) we did not feel it necessary to quantify
all the wetlands in the region. Instead, we focused on how often residents benefitted from provisioning
services (water and vegetation), regulating sevices (flood attenuation and sediment retention) and
cultural services. This is described in lines 113-127.

6. Page 4; Lines 6-8: The authors have mentioned Protected Areas only once in the entire manuscript.
However it will be interesting to know the percentage coverage of the MAP under protected area
network.
#####################################
Reply 19: While we agree that these are pertinent points, we are of the view that this information is
tangential to the rest of the manuscript. Therefore, we have included a citation to a paper in line 82 that
contains an assessment of biodiversity patterns in the MAP biodiversity hotspot for reader who would
like to read more.
With regard to protected area coverage, this too is a specialised, but tangential, topic for this
manuscript. The trouble with this issue is twofold: first, defining a protected area is quite challenging
because the word database for protected areas (i.e. the source used for tracking targets towards the
Conventional of Biological Diversity Aichi targets) differs from the South African protected area database
(because the national protected areas act distinguishes between degrees of protection); second, most
audits of protected areas are either at the scale of ecosystems (i.e. biomes or ecoregions) or at
administrative areas (i.e. national or provincial boundaries). Therefore, there is no source on the
protected areas levels of the MAP hotspot. We, therefore, quantified this ourselves using various
protected area database and found that 2.65-6.69% of the hotspot is formally protected (depending on
which database we use). To be conservative, we state in line 84 that less than 7% of the MAP
biodiversity hotspot is formally protected.

Do the author mean that difference between responses to the ecosystem services were tested? The
authors need to rewrite this section to make the design clear.
Reading the results and specifically Figure 2 show that the authors have tried the t-test between the two
groups of respondents: one which always derived benefits and the other group which occasionally
derives benefits. This analysis doesnt make any sense. What is the scale used in figure 2 (Y-Axis)? It is
unclear.

Reply 24: The methods refered to here have been changed to non-parametric alternatives as suggested
by Reviewer 1 and the methods section has bee rewritten to explain these changes (lines 120-127).
Regarding the figure, which is now Figure 3 in this revision, we acknowledge that the figure caption was
unclear and this lead to the reviewer misinterpreting the plot. The analysis is not comparing groups of
respondents, but rather comparing how frequently respondents reported that they benefitted from the
three classes of ecosystem services presented here (provisioning, regulating and cultural). We have,
therefore, reworked the caption to figure 3 to make it more clear what was being compared.
#####################################
The methodology is flawed and the authors need to rework on the explanation of questionnaire design

community attitude (Ambastha et al., 2008; Hussain and Badola, 2008, 2009; Badola et al. 2013).

Reply 25: We respectfully disagree that our methods are flawed, while acknowledging that no
questionnaire is ever perfect. Unless the reviewer can provide detailed remarks besides those we have
addressed above, then we will assume that our study design is technically sound for the scope of this
study. With regard to the additional resources, we could not find these papers as there is insufficient
bibliographic information. However, after exploring the reviewers publication record, we did find two
papers that we felt were relevant to this study (cited as sources 34 and 35 in our manuscript).

Reply 26: We did not elaborate on Ostroms work in the introduction and methods beasue we are not
testing her ideas, but rather using her ideas to interpret our results. Therefore, we maintain that the
detailed discussion of her work is best suited for the discussion section. Nevertheless, the concept of
tragedy of commons and the importance of collective-choice rules is introduced in lines 20-29 of the
introduction.

pendix B
r editors,
nk you for reconsidering your original decision and allowing us to resubmit this revised manuscript to
al Society Open Science.
are sympathetic of the difficulties finding reviewers for the many submissions at your broad-scope, open
ess journal. So, we certainly do not want to exhaust your pool of reviewers.
we mentioned in our appeal letter, we believe that the referees remarks could be addressed with minor
dification to the manuscript. We outline in detail below how we dealt with each of the referees comments,
briefly provide a summary of how these issues have been addressed here.
first referee (Reviewer 4) seemed to be most concerned about the flow of information and the continuity
ween sections. We agree that the introduction could be strengthened by subtle changes, which we have
lemented in this revision. However, we disagree with the referees suggestions for possible structural
eworks and we explain in detail below why our approach is a more suitable alternative. The rest of the
rees remarks were minor amendments in the text, which we implemented as requested.
second referee (Reviewer 2) had a more substantial criticism that we did not quantify actual ecosystem
vices, but only peoples perceptions of them. This is a valid criticism, but not one that affects the
comes of our study. We explain below (with reference to other studies) why this is not a critical oversight
why it will not affect our results or conclusion. Other remarks by the referee were either minor content
es (which were corrected) or requests for tangential information (which we explain below are
ecessary).
st importantly, we would like to emphasise that neither referee had any substantiative criticisms about the
hods used in this study, the interpretation of the data, or the conclusions drawn from the results. Of
rse, they may have mentioned this in their private comments to the editors, but without access to these
arks, we see no cause to make comprehensive changes to this manuscript.
tly, both referees mentioned that the writing in this manuscript was sub-par. We realise this and have
sed the language and grammar of the whole manuscript. However, since there were only a few specific
arks, it is difficult for us to determine whether we have addressed the referees reservations or not.
ertheless, although we are the first to admit that our writing can be improved, we are convinced that the
n results and conclusions of our study will be clear to readers.
order to make this editorial process as simple as possible, we have highlighted all changes to the
nuscript in yellow, and we provide a point by point description of these changes in the response letter
w (including specific references to lines in the manuscript).
hope that you find our amendments adequate and we keenly await your decision.
d regards,
ko Buschke
at follows is a point-by-point reply to the reviewers comments.

ociate Editor Comments:
le recognising you have worked hard to address the concerns of the first round of review, the referees
tinue to have issues with your work, and do not feel able to recommend it for publication. As the journal's
cy does not generally allow for multiple rounds of revision, we regret that we cannot consider the paper
her for publication. Nevertheless, many thanks for considering Royal Society Open Science for your
k, and we hope the referees' comments are valuable if you choose to submit the paper elsewhere.
Reply 1: We certainly understand the challenge of finding referees for multiple rounds of revision and we
not want to contribute to the widespread reviewer-fatigue that is gripping scientific publishing. We have,
efore, made a concerted effort to not only address the reviewers concerns thoroughly, but also to outline
se changes in this detailed response letter. We hope that this will ensure that making an editorial decision
be as simple and streamlined as possible, without over-taxing any additional handling editors or referees.

manuscript studies human-nature interactions using as a case study the ecological systems of wetlands
a rural community living in a biodiversity hotspot in South Africa as a social system. Interactions are
ed on benefits derived from the wetlands (ecosystem services) and damage-causing activities affecting
wetlands (ecological degradation). It brings to light: i) the relationship or lack of relationship between
age-causing activities, and benefits, and ii) the demographical factors that influence above interactions.
insights gained through this study are valuable as they cover an understudied, yet vulnerable area.
wever, the paper would benefit from a restructuring of content around the two enounced research
stions. The manuscript went through the first round of revisions, and I acknowledge a lot of work has
n invested in the statistical analysis, both from reviewers and authors. A general check for the English
uage is also recommended. Below are some specific comments.
Reply 2: We acknowledge that our early draft did not present information as concisely as this revision.
agree with the referee that the content should be built around out two main questions. However, we are
vinced that clarity can be improved by rearranging the existing information, rather than adding or
oving content.
in addition to addressing the specific remarks outlined below, we also reworked the introduction to be
e accessible to a first-time reader. These changes were subtle, but the effect is noticable. After
sidering the referees remarks, we realised that we had been presenting information in a specific-to-
eral logical sequence (e.g. In this study we quantified X. Previous research has shown that X is
ortant because of concept Y). By flipping the same narrative to a general-to-specific logical sequence, we
confident that we improved the logical flow (e.g. Previous research showed that concept Y is important.
n this study we quantified X because it represents concept Y). These changes are highlighted in lines 44-
46-47 and 49-50.
also added strategic signposting sentences in the introduction to provide some additional context to the
-time reader. (for example, line 35-36). Lastly, we revised the whole manuscript to sharpen the general
uage, focussing specifically on using tenses consistently and removing unnecessary adjectives and
erbs. While we realise that evaluating the quality of language and grammar is often subject, we are
fident that this revision is clearer than its predecessor.
#####################
STRACT
abstract correctly reflects the content of the paper.
sider clarifying or separating the following statements for the abstract: Respondents were more likely to
me others for wetland degradation, although there was no link between the damage-causing activities
benefits from wetlands. Is this reflected as such in the Results section?
Reply 3: We did not modify this sentence in the abstract because we are confident that these statements
e abstract are indeed reflected by the results.
finding that respondents tend to blame others for degradation is the main pattern in the right panel of
ure 2 and the statistically significance of this pattern is outlined in lines 178-181. The lack of link between
age-causing activities and benefits from wetlands is reflected by the regression coefficient in Table 2,
ch did not differ significantly from zero. This finding was also described in lines 189-191.
#####################
RODUCTION
s 6-7: it is not clear how the stated goal This study, therefore, set out to examine whether the people
ponsible for degrading wetlands are the same set of people who would benefit the most from their
servation derives from the previous introductory sentences. Maybe delete therefore or make the link
ween motivation and aim clearer. Also, it is less common that the aim is stated so soon in a flow of a
nuscript. Consider moving information about the aim of this study in the last paragraph of the introduction.
Reply 4: As also described in Reply 2, we have adjusted parts of the introduction to promote a clearer
of information. The specific sentence referred to by the referee has been deleted because it was also
sented in lines 54-56.
#####################
s 30-37: parts of this paragraph rather belong to section 2. Methods (a) Study area
Reply 5: In hindsight, we agree with the referee. Sections of this paragraph have been deleted because
y are already included in the description of the study site. However, the remaining parts (lines 27-33) are
in the introduction because we believe that it provides important context on: (1) that the area is a
iversity hotspot as captured by the title, (2) the region is poverty-striken and there is a high reliance on
land ecosystem services and (3) the wetlands there are on communal resources and susceptible to the
edy of the commons. This information offers a segue between the preceding paragraphs into the
sequent paragraphs.
#####################
s 38-65: most parts of these paragraphs rather belong to section 2. Methods (b) and (c)
Reply 6: Although we respectfully disagree with the referee on this point, we understand why s/he made
remark. As outlined in Reply 2, we have rearranged the content of these paragraphs (now lines 34-52) to
present the general conceptual context and then explain how it is relevant to this specific study. This is
ch more logical and eases the first-time reader into the study. Our original structure began with the
cific strategy used in this manuscript, followed by the broader conceptual context, which, understandably,
e the referee the impression that the information was more suited for the methods section.
revised section first provides the broader conceptual context and then outlines how we incorporated it
our study. We are confident that this information is needed in the introduction section, because it
vides the first-time reader with context on why we designed the questionnaire the way we did and how the
ult ought to be interpreted.
#####################
71: I am not sure social capital is a demographic characteristic. Consider adding whether
ographic characteristics and related social factors such as social capital, 
Reply 7: The referee is indeed correct. Our revised text (lines 44-46) makes this more clear because we,
, explain that social capital is an important determinant of sustainable resource use; and, second, outline
we assume that older respondents and those who lived in the region longer would have developed more
ial capital. Thus, we use demographic variable to infer social capital, rather than measuring social capital
ctly.
#####################
eral comment Introduction: Consider restructuring the introduction so that each paragraph conveys a
neral) message, that only foresees elements of the Discussion without revealing the results. For example,
a suggestion: a paragraph on wetlands in general, a paragraph on benefits/ecosystem services from
lands, a paragraph on threats to wetlands in a certain context, (research gap), a paragraph on the aim
research questions.
Reply 8: We agree with the referees assessment, so the introduction is more streamlined in this revised
sion. However, we chose not to follow the suggested logical framework, but are confident that the
ework used in this revision reflects the context of the manuscript equally well. There is no single correct
to write a scientific paper, but we optimistic that our approach provides a broad context while also laying
groundwork so that subsequent sections can be interpreted accurately.
revised introduction has the following eight paragraphs: (1) wetlands provide important ecosystem
vice to rural communities. (2) Some of these services are often overlooked. (3) Wetlands are also
munal, which can lead to the tragedy of the commons. (4) The tragedy of the commons can be
rcome using collective-choice rules. (5) Our study focuses on ecosystem services from communal
lands in a poverty-stricken biodiversity hotspot. (6) We assessed how community members benefit and
age wetlands. (7) We link these to demographic variables that can be predictors of the effectiveness of
ective choice rules. (8) A closing paragraph with the specific research questions.
refore, we maintain that the structure of our introduction is logically consistent. We are confident that it
cribes the conceptual landscape within which our manuscript fits, provides a broad overview of previously
lished studies, and provides a foundation for subsequent sections.

Reply 14: We have added a sentence (lines 88-90) that provides some context on how Xhosa relates to
study area. There is obviously a much more complicated history of colonisation and resettlement linked
he controversial colonial and apartheid history of Apartheid South Africa. However, this detailed history is
bably irrelevant to our revised manuscript.
#####################
Questionnaire design
y are there separate subsections for Survey design and Questionnaire design?
Reply 15: We distinguished between the survey and the questionnaire design because the former refers
he way the questionnaires was administered (i.e. When was the survey carried out? What language was
d? Which medium was used to administer the questionnaire? How many respondents were there? Was
e informed consent?), while the latter refers to the make-up of the questionnaire itself (i.e. which
stions were included? How were responses scaled? Which demographic variable were quantified? How
e these questions evaluated and analysed?).
possible to merge these sections under a common sub-heading, but this would be a matter of taste and
would a change the results or conclusions.

Reply 19: While we understand the referees suggestion to streamline the methods section to make it
e closely linked to the research question, this was difficult to do in practice because many of the analyses
not directly answer the two main research questions. Instead most of the statistical analyses were
essary precursors to confirm that the data were appropriate for the in the multiple regression analysis:
Cronbachs alpha, McDonalds Hierarchical omega and explained common variance (lines 139-143) were
essary to validate that the data obtained from the questionnaire can be synthesised into single measures
enefits and damages to wetlands.
The Wilcoxon test and dependent sample assessment plots (lines123-127) were necessary to ensure
self-reported responses were reliable, by comparing them to community-reported responses. This was
an essential step to identify any systematic bias in the responses.
The Friedman test and post-hoc tests (lines 110-116) was necessary to ensure that when respondents
e reporting the benefits from ecosystem services, we actually knew which services were more or less
eficial.
h of these steps was necessary to confirm that the data actually reflected what we assumed it
esented. These data were then used in a multiple regression analysis and the coefficients from these
essions (Presented in Table 2) were used to actually answer the two main research questions as outlined
he end of the introduction.

#####################
s 193-194: consider keeping this for discussion only: which is indicative of potential gender-based
er imbalances in the region.
Reply 21: Although the referee is strictly correct here, we believe that keeping this phrase in the results
tion (lines 183-184) helps the reader translate the coefficients estimated from the regression analysis
real-world meaning and consequences. We are of the view that the benefits of keeping this short phrase
weigh the costs of deviating from academic convention.
#####################
le 2 caption: consider separating in more sentences. Did the authors explain in the manuscript what is
ant by the F-score?
Reply 22: We have rephrased the caption slightly to refer only to demographic variables (rather than
ng each variable), which made the caption shorter and easier to read.
h regard to the F-score, it was stated in line 163 that we used a F-test associated with an analysis of
ance to test the significance of regression coefficients. Since this is a standard statistical null hypothesis
used during ANOVA present in all undergraduate statistics textbooks, we do not feel it is necessary to
orate on the details of F-tests and F-scores in this manuscript.
#####################
eral comment Results: Try to keep the same structure around the research questions, the threefold
cture of the questionnaire (example: results to the analysis of section A of the questionnaire covering
pondents demographic information actually answer the second research question, etc.).
Reply 23: We disagree with the referees suggestion for the same reasons outlined in Reply 19. While
referee is indeed correct that the sequential presentation of information is ideal, both research question
actually answered by Table 2. The other results are necessary steps that lead to the headline results in
le 2. Specifically:
ble 1 reports the descriptive demographic data without any additional analysis. We presented this first
ause (a) it gives the reader the necessary context of the demographic make-up of the respondents and
this is the simplest, unprocessed data that can be interpreted on its own.
ext, we present in Figure 2 the comparisons between self-reported and community level responses. This
is important to identify any biases in the responses and ensure that any subsequent statistical analyses
based on reliable estimates of benefits and impacts.
Figure 3, we show that on average everyone benefits from ecosystem services, but that they are more
y to benefit from regulating ecosystem services. This is necessary because unless the community
efits from ecosystems service, any subsequent demographic segmentation of ecosystem service use
ld be pointless.
y once these three sets of results have been established, does it make sense to even consider reading
thing into the multiple regression analysis (Table 2). For example, without (i) community heterogeneity, (ii)
iased responses, and (iii) actual benefits from wetland ecosystem services, the outputs from the
ession models would be riddled with statistical artefacts because the underlying data is uniformative.
therefore, maintain that the the order in which we presented the results is the most scientifically robust
uence that ensures that the results and subsequent conclusions can be trusted.

iewer: 2 Comments to the Author(s)
specific comments to the manuscript are:
s manuscript is about the ecosystem services and ecological degradation of the communal wetlands, but
here in the manuscript the authors have provided the specific ecosystem services to the local community
he study area. The authors have framed this manuscript around the perceived benefits to self as well as
er. But how did the authors choose just a few of the provisioning (plant and water), regulating (flood and
sion) and cultural services, as mentioned in the questionnaire design.
Reply 30: The referee is correct that we did not actually quantify the ecosystem services supplied by the
lands. However, this is not a step that is essential for answering the specific research question in our
nuscript. We justify this using two main lines of reasoning:
t, in our main analysis (Table 2), the benefits from wetlands are aggregated into a single unidimensional
endent variable. We could do this because we explicitly tested the internal consistency of our survey
rument (line 137-149). What this implies is that even had we added or removed other ecosystem services
he questionnaire, our results would be robust because these additional responses would also be
regated into the unidimensional variable (assuming they also represent a single survey scale). This is
iously a simplification of the multidimensional relationship humans have with nature, but it is a necessary
plification for a first assessment in a poorly studied region.
ond, it could be argued that ecosystems services derive their value from how much they are valued by
eficiaries. The very definition of ecosystem services are activities or functions of an ecosystem that
vides benefits to humans (Mace et al. 2012.) and recent conceptualisations refer to natures benefits to
ple (Diaz et al 2015 a,b). Thus, human perceptions of benefits is an important component of the concept
cosystem services. Similarly, the value of ecosystem services is the relative contribution that ecosystems
ke to support peoples well-being. Valuation is inherently complex because it includes intrinsic,
rumental and relational values (Diaz et al. 2015 a,b). We framed our study as the way societies interact
communal natural resources, which depends on collective choice rules (as prominantly illustrated by our
oduction and discussion sections). Collective choice rules depend on human perceptions of the values
y gain from nature. Therefore, we feel justified in assessing the value of ecosystem services based on
viduals perceptions of the benefits they derive from nature. This approach is not new and has been used
other studies before ours (Costanza et al. 2014). Our use of a questionnaire-based survey instrument is
only appropriate, but also widely used by other ecosystem service researchers.
h of these arguments support the methods used in our study. We did not claim to perform a
prehensive assessment of all ecosystem services, nor did we claim to carry out a complete valuation of
se services. For the purpose of our study, simplified questions about some ecosystem services were
icient to answer our research questions in a scientifical robust way. Our questions referred to very broad
vices (water, plants, floods and erosion, insect pests and cultural activities), which allowed respondents to
rpret the benefits from wetlands in their own way. In this way, we accommodated the many relational
es people have with nature, that cannot be assessed by other means (Diaz 2015 a,b)

at was the reason that most of the respondents were in their 20s and 30s, and how many were leaders
ditional or formal), as in survey design it is mentioned that community survey was conducted with
munity members and their leadership. Is community leader a form of employment? I dont agree.
Reply 31: We do not know why most of the respondents were aged 18-39. In all likelihood, it reflects the
frequency-distribution of the region. Unfortunately, the South African Statistics Agency does not provide
ailed information for this region specifically, but for the whole Eastern Cape province 30% of the
ulation is between 18-39. Considering that we only interviewed one person per household, it seems
istically likely that the head of the household would be in this age group.
h regard to including community leader as a form of employment: the referee is correct in pointing out that
could be defined as a community role instead of a form of employment. However, we chose to rather list
s a form of employment because in South Africa traditional leaders are paid salaries directly by the
ernment (these salaries are publicly available in the Government Gazette, but their might be other non-
losed payments as well). Monarchs, such as the King of the amaPondo from our study area, receive
roximately US$ 80 000 per year, while senior traditional leaders will receive approximately US $17 000
h year. This is a substantial amount of money for a region with more than 50% unemployment. Since we
d employment as an indicator of dependence on wetlands, we could not ignore that traditional leaders
e an alternative source of income that reduces their dependence on natural resources. Hence our
ision to list traditional leader as a form of employment rather than as a role in the community (although
munity leader will also be included in the Other category of Community role)..

Reply 32: As already addressed in the previous reply, this study took place in a deeply rural area that is
listed in the publicly accessible records by the South African Statistics Agency. Moreover, the last national
sus was conducted in 2011, so we assume that the information cited from the 2016 Integrated

ill be useful to provide a list of traditional activities carried out by people in the wetlands, in the Study

Reply 33: We addressed this remark during the previous round of revisions. A list of all the traditional
vities is beyond the scope of our study because it requires a comprehensive socio-cultural assessment of
ctices that may be taboo to share with outsiders. However, in lines 256-260 and 288-289 of the
ussion, we described some traditional practices and, more importantly, provide citations to work that is
e specific to the issue of traditional Xhosa cultural activities.
also important to point our that we asked respondents whether they used wetlands to express their
ure. This allowed them to interpret this in their own personal way, which is an essential step to
rporating relational values between humans and nature (see Reply 30)

Reply 36: We are uncertain what the referee is referring to here. Table 2 shows the outputs from the
ession model with damage-causing activities and demographic variables (including gender) as predictor
ables. Since the regression coefficient for gender is positive and statistically different from zero, we can
ed conclude that men benefit from wetland ecosystem services more than women. We do not

NERAL COMMENTS
ust preface my review by noting that I am not experienced in questionnaire surveys and their analysis and
rpretation, and therefore I am very limited in terms of commenting on any methodological issues in the
er. Instead I comment mainly from the perspective of my experience in assessing wetland ecological
radation and ecosystem services provision.
manuscript addresses a relevant and important topic for which there has not been much research
ducted in South Africa. From my perspective (and with my limitations in terms of questionnaire surveys)
study appears to be generally scientifically sound, well conceptualized and implemented, and well
sented, and makes a useful scientific contribution with practical application. However, there are three
ortant general issues which should be addressed, as well a few specific issues which require attention,
ch are given below.
Reply 2: We would like to thank the reviewer for the helpful comments. We also appreciate the reviewers
kness about not being familiar with questionnaire-based studies like ours. Although we are confident
ut the technical soundness of our methods (based on the earlier rounds of rigorous peer review), we
eve it is important that our findings reach an audience of wetland managers beyond those narrowly
ssed on questionnaire-based studies. Therefore, we appreciate the reviewers insights and we hope that
manuscript is a convincing and reliable source of information to general wetland practitioners.
boration on damage to wetlands and the basis on which specific activities are deemed to be damaging or
Although the paper identifies four damage-causing activities fairly early on in the paper (Grazing,
ughing, Dumping and Burning) it lacks any specific indication of what is meant by damage to wetlands
the basis on which specific activities are deemed to be damaging or not. It is important that this be done
n that damage-causing activities are a central focus of the paper. The implication seems to be that all of
four listed uses are inherently damaging, and while this probably stands for ploughing and dumping, it is
e nuanced for grazing and burning. Wetlands over much of South Africa, and probably in the study area,
lved under fire and indigenous grazers (e.g. buffalo) (Fynn et al. 2015 and Kotze 2013) and where large
zers such as buffalo are no longer present in an area then domestic livestock can to fair degree replace
r effect. The damage resulting from fire and grazing relates to the specifics of the grazing/burning regime,
from annual fires or prolonged intense grazing.

Reply 3: We agree whole-heartedly with the reviewer about the importance of grazing and fire in
ntaining ecological functioning in wetlands (as well as other ecosystems, like grasslands). That said, our
y area lacks rotational grazing practices and a formal burning regime. Although we must acknowledge
we have not actually quantified the detrimental effects of grazing and burning on wetland functioning, we
eve that the balance of evidence from earlier studies in the wider region suggests that chronic
rgrazing and frequent burning has lead to wetland degradation (though defoliation, sediment mobilisation,
compaction and increased water turbidity). This rationale is now elaborated on in lines 120-124, which
cific reference to previously published papers:
Although ploughing and dumping waste are clearly detrimental to wetland integrity, historical grazing
by wild ungulates, contemporary grazing by livestock and natural burning regimes can be important
drivers of wetland functioning [25,26]. However, lack of rotational grazing and inadequate fire
management in the region has lead to chronic degradation of the wider landscape [27,28].
eater depth of reporting on the different wetland uses/benefits: A greater depth of reporting is required on
different uses made of the wetlands in the study area, the compatibility/incompatibility of these respective
s and how demographics (in particular gender) may be specific to particular uses. This would help given
reader more insights into some of the key findings reported in the paper, e.g. that males were more likely
enefit from the wetland than females. Also see specific comments on Page 7, Figure 3.
Reply 4: This suggestion of a trade-off analysis and a subgroup analysis is an interesting one and it
ld definitely provide valuable insights if it could be carried out appropriately. However, we are reluctant to
orate too much into the uses of wetlands for three reasons:
t, our questionnaire was very simple by design in order to avoid miscommunication during translation and
administering of the survey. Therefore, it is not possible to quantify the extent of the damage causing
vity (e.g. our questionnaire did not distinguish between respondents who allowed an entire herd of cattle
raze the wetland and respondents who only had one or two cows), which would be necessary for
luating potential trade-offs between benefits and damage caused to wetlands. For instance, it might be
moderate grazing is compatible with the continued supply of ecosystem services like clean water, but
heavy overgrazing might not be.
ond, our results only report on the perceptions of respondents, not actual empirical evidence of benefits
damages. Therefore, the gender differences we report in Table 2 might represent differences in how men
women perceive benefits, rather than the benefits they actually receive. Understanding this subtlety will,
ever, require additional research and we do not want to speculate too widely based on our dataset.
d, we are especially reluctant to perform a subgroup analysis on gender because this would constitute a
of data dredging where the same dataset used to identify the hypothesis is subsequently used to test
very same hypothesis. Not only would this increase the Type I error rate due to multiple comparisons, it
her reduces the statistical power of our dataset by reducing the effective sample size of each subgroup.
le it is possible to perform exploratory analyses without carrying out inferential statistics (see below), we
not feel that this would be appropriate for the main manuscript. Moreover, these exploratory analyses
gest that males generally benefit from provisioning and cultural services more than women, but there is
stantial overlap that makes subgroup interpretations ambiguous. If readers would like to explore these
group analyses themselves, then they can use the raw data which is publically available.

system services. Boxplots show the minimum, 25 th percentile, median, 75th percentile and maximum
es (points reflect outliers). Here, 0 denotes that respondents never benefit, 1 that they sometimes benefit
2 denotes that they always benefit from wetlands.
orting on collective choice rules for wetlands in the study area:
paper makes several general references to collective choice rules and has a sub-section in the
ussion on Governance. One would therefore anticipate that some specifics on these rules would be
orted on for wetlands in the study area. But this seems to be entirely missing. While acknowledging that
was not the focus of the questionnaire, it is relevant to the study objectives and deserves some attention,
n if it is that no collective choice rules for wetlands in the study area appear to exist.
Reply 5: It is unclear to us what exactly is being requested here. Collective choice rules would still need
e negotiated by local community members, so it is not feasible for us to describe these rules in this
nuscript. However, we feel it is necessary to state that general wetland management best-practice
ady exists in South Africa, so the collective choice rules would focus on the implementation of these rules
ile indigenous knowledge could inform management best-practice, the main aim of local decision-making
ss about what should be done, but rather how it should be done). We have made this case in lines
-292.
ECIFIC COMMENTS
tract, However, wetlands are often on communal land and face degradation by individuals who maximise
r personal benefit from ecosystem services without bearing the full environmental costs of their actions.
ggest deleting this sentence, which is general and I am also not sure fully substantiated. This would
vide more words available in the Abstract for the authors to report on an additional specific finding of the
earch in place of this general statement.
Reply 6: We are of the view that this sentence is important in the abstract to explain the challenge of
naging communal resources. That said, the original sentence was rather clunky, so we have rewritten it
clarity.
e 2, line 15-17, Common-pool resources are resources that are rival (i.e. 16 using the resources
uces its availability to other users), but non-excludable (i.e. one cannot 17 restrict access to these
ources) It is not necessarily so that common-pool resources are non-excludable, as in fact is identified in
following paragraphs reference to collective choice rules (which may include exclusions).
Reply 7: This is indeed a subtlety that was missing. Common pool resources can be exclusionary, but
if all the users agree to this exclusion (i.e. no single individual has the right to unilaterally exclude other
rs). We made this subtly more explicit in lines 16 and 17.
e 3, line 72, These wetlands are.prone to degradation caused by man-made activities. /A few words
cating why they are prone to such degradation would be useful
Reply 8: We have clarified in lines 74 and 75 that these wetlands are prone to degradation because there
no restrictions on who can use these ecosystems.
e 4 line 100-104. (2) how often respondents partook in the most common damage-causing activities to
lands (identified during prior site visits). A few words should be added in terms of what was carried out in
prior site visits. As it stands, this is not clear.
Reply 9: This has been clarified in line 103. The earlier site visit was just an informal reconnoissance trip
out any formal quantification of impacts. Instead, we just observed ploughing, grazing, burning and
ping, which were subsequently added to our questionnaire.
e 6, line 189, Notably, respondents who were more likely to partake in grazing, ploughing, dumping or
ning did not stand to benefit any more from wetland ecosystem services than their peers. Sorry this is a
unclear. Are the peers being referred to here not likely to partake in grazing, ploughing, dumping or
ning? This should be clarified.
Reply 10: This sentence is based on the non-significant regression coefficient in Table 2. From Figure 2,
an be inferred that both self-reported and group-perceived damage happens slightly less than
casionally (the vertical and horizontal grey dashed lines are slightly less than 1). However, the newly
ified sentence in lines 195-197 is referring to the result that respondents who partook in damaging
vities more frequently did not also benefit more from wetland ecosystem services.
e 7, para 1: perceive group should read perceived group
Reply 11: Corrected in the caption for Figure 2.
e 7, Figure 3: In the text accompanying Figure 3 it would be informative to report on some of the specific
vices within the three broad categories reported in /Figure 3, namely provisioning, regulating and cultural
vices. As it stands I cannot see it reported anywhere in the paper.
Reply 12: This information on how the specific responses of benefits were categorised into the three
system service categories in Figure 3 was reported in the methods section (lines 109-111).
e 8, line 193, This study showed that all community members benefited from ecosystem services from
lands in the Hlabathi administrative area, South Africa, This statement could be better substantiated
ugh more specific reporting.
Reply 13: There are several different lines of evidence to justify this statement. First, in Figure 2 the
an benefits (dashed grey lines) show that both individuals and the group benefit from wetlands more than
asionally. Second, in Figure 3, respondents benefit from all the ecosystem service categories more than
asionally. Finally, the intercept coefficient in Table 2 (1.506) implies that, on average, all respondents
efit from wetlands somewhere between Occasionally and Always. This is stated explicitly in the results
tion (lines 182-184). Therefore, we think the general claim made at the start of the discussion section is
lly supported by the data.
e 8, line 193-195, This study showed that all community members benefited from ecosystem services
wetlands in the Hlabathi administrative area, South Africa, but men tended to benefit more than
men. This statement needs to be substantiated and elaborated on with more specific reporting, in
icular giving the reader a better sense of which of the specific services this applied to, thereby helping
reader to better understand why men tended to benefit more than women.
Reply 14: As already explained in Reply 4, we are reluctant to speculate why men reported more benefits
n women. Based on our analysis, the significant regression coefficient in Table 2 confirms the difference
weens between men and women. Unfortunately, we believe that elaborating on the deeper mechanism for
gender imbalance would be drawing unjustifiable conclusions from our data. In our original submission,
n this version, we highlight the importance of interrogating further the underlying reasons for our reported
der discrepancies (lines 260-267).
e 8, line 197-199, Moreover, there was no evidence that the men and women who degraded wetlands
ed more from wetland ecosystem services than their fellow community members. More information is
uired in terms of what constitutes someone who degraded wetlands. See General comments.
Reply 15: This issue has already been addressed in Reply 10
e 8, line 216: I am not sure that seasonal grazing is a good example of a resource which is mobile,
ch seems to be implied.
Reply 16: This has been clarified in lines 222 and 223, which states that the grazing lands themselves
not mobile, but that they require different usage rules during different times of the year.
e 9 line 218-219, However, the productivity and predictability of these ecosystems might be potential
tacles to their sustainable use. This statement needs to be better elaborated upon, e.g. productivity and
dictability in terms of what?
Reply 17: This has been clarified in lines 225 and 226 to explain that the productivity and predictability of
system services can affect how communal wetlands can be sustainably utilised.
e 9 line 242-244, Community members have a shared interest in preserving wetland systems, which
s them from the conflict caused by different land-use pressures (e.g. [35,36]). Sorry, it is unclear to me
e a general shared interest in preserving wetlands should free community members from conflict caused
ifferent land-use pressures. I can appreciate how a shared interest could help in resolving conflicts, but it
ms unrealistic that it would free users from conflicts.
Reply 18: This has been clarified in lines 250-251. If everyone benefits from wetland services, then there
ss conflict than is the case when some community member benefit and others do not (as is reported in
cited papers, which were requested by the referee during the first round of review)
e 9 line 248, Gender is an important determinant of pro-environmental behaviour Some elaboration of
this should be so would be useful. In addition, what would constitute pro-environmental behaviour?
Reply 19: This has been elaborated on in lines 255-256.
e 10 line 279, The final predictor of sustainable use of common-pool resources is good governance
ctures with collective choice rules As elaborated on in the General comments, the paper provides
ortant general statements such as this but seems to be lacking in terms of reporting on the specifics of
collective choice rules for use of the wetlands in the study area.
Reply 20: This point has already been addressed in Reply 5 above. The collective choice rules will need
e negotiated by local users, so it is not our role to impose these rules in this manuscript.
e 10 line 286, This is not because respondents are generally selfish or have negative perceptions of
ure. On the contrary, respondents were Xhosa, a cultural group that has been shown previously to score
ly on various measures of nature connectedness [27,39]. Such human-biosphere connectedness is
tral to sustainable use of ecosystems and resilient social-ecological systems [48,49]. Some of the
umptions in these statements are potentially problematic, in particular what appears to be an assumed
rriding influence that so-called nature connectedness might have over immediate self interests.
Reply 21: We respectfully disagree with this suggestion because the very next sentence in this
agraph (lines 301-302) elaborates that the challenge is translating nature-connectedness to broader
iety and its institutions. The reviewer is correct that nature-connectedness needs to overcome incentives
self-interest, which is exactly what is being conveyed by our statement that such connectedness needs to
reflected in the institutions (formal and informal, which includes incentives) that govern communal
ources.
e 10 line 292, It is possible that communicating scientific information to traditional leadership structures
ld establish sustainable practices throughout the wider community. What appears to be the implicit
umption here may often not hold that altered awareness/perceptions will necessarily lead to altered
ctices.
Reply 22: This comment is indeed true and it relates to Reply 5 above. The collective choice rules are
arily about implementation of sustainable practices. This will only arise through a deliberative negotiation
ween resources users. Traditional leaders do tend to have more influence, so they are valuable conduits
scientific information throughout the rest of the community
e 10 line 299 Instead, it needs to be embedded into a multi-level governance structure (e.g. [52]) that
udes national initiatives, like the Working for Wetlands expanded public works programme I am not sure
a public works programme is the best example to give for a natural resources governance structure.
Reply 23: We respectfully want to point out here that the reviewers reservations are based on an
mplete reading of the first part of this sentence. The first part of the sentence states that public works
grammes are important for sustainable wetland usage, but the second part of the sentence (lines 312-
) makes it clear that these formal government initiatives must be integrated with grassroot-level collective
ice rules. This multi-level structure is necessary in such a poverty-stricken community, where government
ources can be leveraged to support local-level resource management.
