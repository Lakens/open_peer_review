The premise of this paper is interesting - that the habitat-dependent differences in morphology
affect swimming performance and schooling behaviour, and it is investigated at multiple levels –
classic landmark morphology, in vitro muscle physiology, swim performance tests , and
schooling behaviour, an approach which is good. Unfortunately, there are technical flaws in the
work:
i. One of the stated goals (L. 93) was to test whether morphological differences reported 10
years ago in these same habitats (ref. 26) persisted now. But in that study, adults were sampled,
whereas this time smaller sub-adults were sampled. In consequence, no clear conclusions can be
drawn.
ii. The authors seem to believe that ionoregulatory costs would increase with salinity (L.
103-104, L. 410-411). Yet the ion gradients between the fish`s ECF and the environment will be
minimal at 10 ppt as this is approximately the isosmotic salinity. The costs in 0 ppt and 20 ppt
will likely be greater (and similar) as the gradients are about the same. Indeed it is unfortunate
that 10 ppt was not used in most tests, as this would have been the most informative treatment.
iii. The in vitro tests on muscle contractility were performed using equilibration with a
mammalian gas mixture (95% O2, 5% CO2) (L. 193). 5% CO2 would be fatal to most fish, causing
an intense respiratory acidosis – fall in tissue pH due to carbonic acid. 0.3% CO2, not 5% CO2
should have been used. Thus the muscle contractility data are not useful.
iv. The critical swimming speed tests used an interval of 5 min. In such a short period , the
fish are not in steady state The original Brett protocol used 45 – 60 min, and more recently Farrell
has published papers claiming that 20 min is acceptable. But 5 min is not. Ref 28, cited as the basis
for the protocol used, was performed by a biochemistry group who compared 2 min and 10 min
tests, and found no difference in the results, which is perhaps not surprising. Classical criteria
were not evaluated. It is strange that in ref. 28, critical swimming speed was about 8 BL/sec, yet
only 2.4-4 BL/sec in the present study – in the same species.
v. Fig 4 reports mean distance between neighbours in terms of swimming speed (BL/sec).
This does not make sense.
The Discussion is long and overly speculative. It seems to take as a “given” that differences
observed can be ascribed to epigenetic effects, but there is no genetic (or epigenetic) data in this
paper.

Seebacher et al. present an interesting, broad-based study on the relationship between
morphological, physiological, and behavioral divergence in threespine stickleback occurring in
three different habitat types in a small geographic area. The authors sampled stickleback from six
sites in an area that they had sampled 10 years prior. Thus the study builds on a rich base of
knowledge. Geometric morphometric methods are used to examine body shape variation in
combination with measures of muscle activity and behavioral assays. Thus this is a pretty
comprehensive study. The main objective of the study is to examine whether morphological
changes in stickleback in response to different habitats within a heterogeneous environment leads
to divergence in locomotor performance or behavior. The paper is well written and important
conceptual issues are touched upon throughout. I do have some concerns that I think need to be
addressed before the study moves forward.
-A map indicating where the sampling sites are with respect to one another should be included.
The authors indicate that two sites for each habitat type were sampled indicating that there is
replication by habitat and they provide distances between sites within habitat types. However, it
is not clear how sites from different habitat types are positioned with respect to one another. This
is a major concern because if the sites from each habitat type are closer to one another than to
sites from other habitat types, part of the signal of divergence between habitats may relate to
spatial autocorrelation more than local adaptation or independent plasticity by habitat. Also, I
would suggest latitude and longitude be provided for each site.
-Based on the descriptions, it seems like different fish were used for the morphometrics, muscle
physiology and behavioral assays. If so, it should be stated explicitly. It would have been nice to
use the same fish for the different experiments to see how these variables tied together within
individuals.
-For the behavioral measurements, the authors indicate that fish were tested in groups of four but
it is not clear if the same fish were used in repeated trials or if different fish were used. How
many total fish were used per treatment?
-Can something more be said about why mean voluntary speed in an artificial environment is an
interesting behavioral variable to measure? Inter-individual distances seems self-evident as a
variable that related to schooling behavior, but I am not clear what mean voluntary speed says
4
about behavior. Something should probably be said about why this was measured and why it is
interesting.
-“Caudal fin” is used repeatedly like it was measured but based on the landmarks used, what
was measured was the caudal peduncle. The landmarks outline the caudal peduncle. The caudal
fin is the fin at the end of the caudal peduncle. In places like page 11, line 273, when the authors
say a reduced caudal fin, do they mean caudal peduncle? Please correct if so. There are other
references in the paper to caudal fin. Otherwise, specify how the caudal fin was measured.
-It seems counterintuitive that the ditch fish have the best swimming performance. An
explanation is given in terms overall mass because ditch fish are deeper bodied. Might this also
reflect that getting to the ditches is demanding in terms of swimming and the fish inhabiting
these ditched are migrants or descendants of migrants that were very strong swimmers?
-Something that needs to be improved is putting the results of this specific study in the context of
previous studies on stickleback morphology and swimming performance. Previous authors have
looked at morphological divergence among stickleback and swimming performance and
physiology. The introduction is conceptually broad, which is good, but ignores previous work on
stickleback morphological variation besides the previous study done by the same authors. The
authors should retain the broad approach that they have taken in the introduction but then
should get into more specific anticipated results based on the enormous stickleback literature or
be comparing their results in much more detail to other stickleback studies in the discussion.
There is a lot that we know about stickleback ecomorphology that has been left out of this paper
and could greatly improve the quality of the paper.
-Why would swimming behavior change with morphology? And why would behavior be
associated with salinity? Are there previous results from other studies that can guide why these
aspects of behavior were chosen and how we might expect them to vary? The authors present
background on body shape (body depth) to develop a hypothesis on their expectations for
swimming performance, but other variables are not as clearly developed in the introductions.
-I do not have expertise in muscle physiology so I leave comments on that component of the
study to other reviewers.
Minor Comments:
-Page 8, line 180: Was there a reason that an anesthetic was not used?
-Page 11, line 252: Seems like standard length was analyzed as a response variable with the
discriminant scores from the body shape analysis but in line 257 the authors indicate it was used
as a covariate for the analysis of the discriminant scores and other response variable. So it was
used as both a response variable and a covariate? This should be clarified. Standard length
should definitely be included as a covariate in all analysis because many of the things measured
will covary with size. I am not clear about why it would be included as a response variable if it is
also used as a covariate though.
-Page 11, line 256: Should be “discriminant functions” not “discriminate functions”.
-Page 14, line 334: Use something like “arose” instead of “evolved” because like you say below,
you do not know that these are genetically based differences and thus evolutionary differences.
By saying “evolved solely as a result of local adaptation”, the sentence suggests there was some
evolution although this has not been shown. It could all be plasticity although I suspect some of
this is indeed local adaptation.
-Page 14, lines 339-342: Andrew Hendry’s work on the Misty Lake system in British Columbia
should probably be cited in this section. They show local adaptation and genetic differentiation
over very small distances in one lake-stream system. Their work and that of others indicates that
you can see local (genetic) adaptation on microgeographical scales, which is relvant to this study.
5
-Page 15, line 358. What is known about how often local dredging occurs in this system. Has this
been implied in studies of divergence in other species areas? This sentence seems relevant but
comes out of the blue with no context given. I would cite sources for the potential effects of this
type of human disturbance and/or indicate how often these particular systems are dredged.
-Page 15, lines 369-372: Orbit size tends to be strongly correlated with body size across fishes.
Smaller fish have larger eyes, with relative eye size declining as they grow. SL was included as a
covariate in the modeling but as far as I can tell the body shape data were not size-corrected for
the discriminant analysis. So there may be a component of allometry in these data. It may be
worth looking at whether some of the variation in body shape between habitats is not associated
with the body size differences seen between habitats.
-Page 16, line 399: Provide references for the statement indicating that caudal fin propulsion
becomes increasingly important at higher swimming speeds.
-Page 18, line 426: I would remove the sentence on greater swimming speed being associated with
shorter distances between fish. This did not seem counterintuitive to me and will likely not be
counterintuitive to many readers because you often see tight schooling when fish are swimming
rapidly in response to a predator or being startled.
-Fig. 1: I would suggest a better color scheme for Fig. 1 and maybe try to make the colors uniform
throughout the whole figure. With the colors presently used, you cannot really distinguish the
circles if the paper is printed in black and white, which is very common. With three habitats, it
seems like it would be quite easy to use a white, gray, black color scheme to maximize contrast
regardless of whether the figures are in color or black and white and it would be easy to
distinguish between sites within habitats by using different symbols. It is often helpful to
coordinate the color scheme across figures. You seem to use different colors for the same samples
in different figures. Being consistent for most figures would make it easier for the reader to
interpret the results across figures.
-Fig. 1E: Specify that the Y axis is standard length. Length is too vague, could be Total length.

morphology affect swimming performance and schooling behaviour, and it is
investigated at multiple levels – classic landmark morphology, in vitro muscle
physiology, swim performance tests , and schooling behaviour, an approach which is
good. Unfortunately, there are technical flaws in the work:
i. One of the stated goals (L. 93) was to test whether morphological differences
reported 10 years ago in these same habitats (ref. 26) persisted now. But in that study,
adults were sampled, whereas this time smaller sub-adults were sampled. In
consequence, no clear conclusions can be drawn.
RESPONSE: the size difference prevented us to do quantitative statistical
comparisons between the sampling times. This did not prevent us, however, to
determine whether there still are morphological differences between populations after
the 10 year interval - this latter aspect was our stated goal. We have now emphasised
this in the text (93-94), and we also address this explicitly in the Discussion (362-
379).
ii. The authors seem to believe that ionoregulatory costs would increase with
salinity (L. 103-104, L. 410-411). Yet the ion gradients between the fish`s ECF and
the environment will be minimal at 10 ppt as this is approximately the isosmotic
salinity. The costs in 0 ppt and 20 ppt will likely be greater (and similar) as the
gradients are about the same. Indeed it is unfortunate that 10 ppt was not used in most
tests, as this would have been the most informative treatment.
RESPONSE: yes, that is a good point. We have rewritten the sections identified by
the reviewer to incorporate the reasoning suggested by the reviewer.
iii. The in vitro tests on muscle contractility were performed using equilibration
with a mammalian gas mixture (95% O2, 5% CO2) (L. 193). 5% CO2 would be fatal
to most fish, causing an intense respiratory acidosis – fall in tissue pH due to carbonic
acid. 0.3% CO2, not 5% CO2 should have been used. Thus the muscle contractility
data are not useful.
RESPONSE: this is a mistake that occurred when transcribing the methods from a
mouse study: we just aerated the fish preps, and did not use pre-mixed gas. We
iv. The critical swimming speed tests used an interval of 5 min. In such a short
period , the fish are not in steady state The original Brett protocol used 45 – 60 min,
and more recently Farrell has published papers claiming that 20 min is acceptable.
But 5 min is not. Ref 28, cited as the basis for the protocol used, was performed by a
biochemistry group who compared 2 min and 10 min tests, and found no difference in
the results, which is perhaps not surprising. Classical criteria were not evaluated. It is
strange that in ref. 28, critical swimming speed was about 8 BL/sec, yet only 2.4-4
BL/sec in the present study – in the same species.
RESPONSE: exercising animals are never in a steady state: substrates are used up,
metabolites accumulate, substrates are switched, calcium stores are depleted etc. The
value of Ucrit lies in measuring a quantifiable response to an exercise challenge that
can be compared between treatments. The absolute value of Ucrit is rather
meaningless, and there is no absolute correct procedure particularly when applied
across species as the referee suggests (surely measuring swimming performance in a
trout or salmon requires very different methodology to measuring it in a labriform
swimmer such as a stickleback). The important aspect is that there is an aerobic
exercise challenge, and we achieved this with our protocol. Besides, there are as many
published studies that use 5 min intervals as there are others that use 20 or 40 min.
v. Fig 4 reports mean distance between neighbours in terms of swimming speed
(BL/sec). This does not make sense.
RESPONSE: that was a typo and I changed it to (BL).
The Discussion is long and overly speculative. It seems to take as a “given” that
differences observed can be ascribed to epigenetic effects, but there is no genetic (or
epigenetic) data in this paper.
RESPONSE: we edited the discussion to remove unnecessarily speculative sections.
We broadened the discussion on potential genetic influences on stickleback
phenotypes to provide a more nuanced argument, and we ensured that the text did not
imply that we ascribe observed differences to epigenetic mechanisms; we discuss
these as a potential explanation, but it was not our intention to conclude that
epigenetics are responsible for the patterns we observed.

Comments to the Author(s)
Seebacher et al. present an interesting, broad-based study on the relationship between
morphological, physiological, and behavioral divergence in threespine stickleback
occurring in three different habitat types in a small geographic area. The authors
sampled stickleback from six sites in an area that they had sampled 10 years prior.
Thus the study builds on a rich base of knowledge. Geometric morphometric methods
are used to examine body shape variation in combination with measures of muscle
activity and behavioral assays. Thus this is a pretty comprehensive study. The main
objective of the study is to examine whether morphological changes in stickleback in
response to different habitats within a heterogeneous environment leads to divergence
conceptual issues are touched upon throughout. I do have some concerns that I think
need to be addressed before the study moves forward.
-A map indicating where the sampling sites are with respect to one another should be
included. The authors indicate that two sites for each habitat type were sampled
indicating that there is replication by habitat and they provide distances between sites
within habitat types. However, it is not clear how sites from different habitat types are
positioned with respect to one another. This is a major concern because if the sites
from each habitat type are closer to one another than to sites from other habitat types,
part of the signal of divergence between habitats may relate to spatial autocorrelation
more than local adaptation or independent plasticity by habitat. Also, I would suggest
latitude and longitude be provided for each site.
RESPONSE: We provided latitudes and longitudes and some more description of the
sites. At this point, we opted not to include a map, but we can do so should that be
desirable in addition to the coordinates given.
-Based on the descriptions, it seems like different fish were used for the
morphometrics, muscle physiology and behavioral assays. If so, it should be stated
explicitly. It would have been nice to use the same fish for the different experiments
to see how these variables tied together within individuals.
RESPONSE: we stated clearly now that none of the fish were used for more than one
experimental measure.
-For the behavioral measurements, the authors indicate that fish were tested in groups
of four but it is not clear if the same fish were used in repeated trials or if different
fish were used. How many total fish were used per treatment?
RESPONSE: We clarified now that we did not reuse individuals for different trials
and used a total of 144 fish.
-Can something more be said about why mean voluntary speed in an artificial
environment is an interesting behavioral variable to measure? Inter-individual
distances seems self-evident as a variable that related to schooling behavior, but I am
not clear what mean voluntary speed says about behavior. Something should probably
be said about why this was measured and why it is interesting.
RESPONSE: we added a section (+references) in the Methods explaining why we
chose to measure voluntary speed and group cohesion (both reflect behavioural
changes, l233-238). We also added extra information in the Discussion.
-“Caudal fin” is used repeatedly like it was measured but based on the landmarks
used, what was measured was the caudal peduncle. The landmarks outline the caudal
peduncle. The caudal fin is the fin at the end of the caudal peduncle. In places like
page 11, line 273, when the authors say a reduced caudal fin, do they mean caudal
peduncle? Please correct if so. There are other references in the paper to caudal fin.
Otherwise, specify how the caudal fin was measured.
RESPONSE: we did measure the caudal peduncle, and we corrected the use of
"caudal fin" throughout the ms.
-It seems counterintuitive that the ditch fish have the best swimming performance. An
explanation is given in terms overall mass because ditch fish are deeper bodied. Might
this also reflect that getting to the ditches is demanding in terms of swimming and the
fish inhabiting these ditched are migrants or descendants of migrants that were very
strong swimmers?
RESPONSE: the ditches are drainage ditches with little water flow, so that swimming
against a flow would not have selected for different pheno- or genotypes. We feel that
similar arguments could be made for the other habitats (especially the river) as well
but would become very speculative.
-Something that needs to be improved is putting the results of this specific study in
the context of previous studies on stickleback morphology and swimming
performance. Previous authors have looked at morphological divergence among
stickleback and swimming performance and physiology. The introduction is
conceptually broad, which is good, but ignores previous work on stickleback
morphological variation besides the previous study done by the same authors. The
authors should retain the broad approach that they have taken in the introduction but
then should get into more specific anticipated results based on the enormous
stickleback literature or be comparing their results in much more detail to other
stickleback studies in the discussion. There is a lot that we know about stickleback
ecomorphology that has been left out of this paper and could greatly improve the
quality of the paper.
RESPONSE: we added several references and text specific to stickleback to the
Introduction, and we discuss our results more specifically now to other studies on
stickleback.
-Why would swimming behavior change with morphology? And why would behavior
be associated with salinity? Are there previous results from other studies that can
guide why these aspects of behavior were chosen and how we might expect them to
vary? The authors present background on body shape (body depth) to develop a
hypothesis on their expectations for swimming performance, but other variables are
not as clearly developed in the introductions.
RESPONSE: we have now added a section in the Introduction that provides more
detail on how salinity can affect body shape, swimming performance, and behaviour.
-I do not have expertise in muscle physiology so I leave comments on that component
of the study to other reviewers.
Minor Comments:
-Page 8, line 180: Was there a reason that an anesthetic was not used?
RESPONSE: A blow to the head is a very quick and effective method of euthanasia,
which was approved on our Animal Ethics permit. Anaesthetics can potentially
biomechanics in fresh muscle.
-Page 11, line 252: Seems like standard length was analyzed as a response variable
with the discriminant scores from the body shape analysis but in line 257 the authors
indicate it was used as a covariate for the analysis of the discriminant scores and other
response variable. So it was used as both a response variable and a covariate? This
should be clarified. Standard length should definitely be included as a covariate in all
analysis because many of the things measured will covary with size. I am not clear
about why it would be included as a response variable if it is also used as a covariate
though.
RESPONSE: we edited this sentence to make clear that we analysed standard length
as a dependent variable, and used it as a covariate in the analyses of the other
dependent variables. We added the clarification: "We analysed standard length as a
dependent variable to determine whether fish length differed between habitats as
salinity can affect growth rates and size (see Introduction)".
-Page 11, line 256: Should be “discriminant functions” not “discriminate functions”.
RESPONSE: I think that "discriminant" is correct.
-Page 14, line 334: Use something like “arose” instead of “evolved” because like you
say below, you do not know that these are genetically based differences and thus
evolutionary differences. By saying “evolved solely as a result of local adaptation”,
the sentence suggests there was some evolution although this has not been shown. It
could all be plasticity although I suspect some of this is indeed local adaptation.
RESPONSE: we changed the sentence as suggested.
-Page 14, lines 339-342: Andrew Hendry’s work on the Misty Lake system in British
Columbia should probably be cited in this section. They show local adaptation and
genetic differentiation over very small distances in one lake-stream system. Their
work and that of others indicates that you can see local (genetic) adaptation on
microgeographical scales, which is relvant to this study.
RESPONSE: yes, that was an oversight on our part, and we now included a
discussion of Hendry (et al's) work.
-Page 15, line 358. What is known about how often local dredging occurs in this
system. Has this been implied in studies of divergence in other species areas? This
sentence seems relevant but comes out of the blue with no context given. I would cite
sources for the potential effects of this type of human disturbance and/or indicate how
often these particular systems are dredged.
RESPONSE: we removed this paragraph, because we do not have any quantitative
data on dredging, just observations made over the years. We could not find any
literature showing effects of dredging on fish populations.
-Page 15, lines 369-372: Orbit size tends to be strongly correlated with body size
grow. SL was included as a covariate in the modeling but as far as I can tell the body
shape data were not size-corrected for the discriminant analysis. So there may be a
component of allometry in these data. It may be worth looking at whether some of the
variation in body shape between habitats is not associated with the body size
differences seen between habitats.
RESPONSE: I think that we have done that by using length as covariate in the
analyses of the discriminant functions, which removes the effect of length differences
in the comparison of DF1 and DF2 between habitats.
-Page 16, line 399: Provide references for the statement indicating that caudal fin
propulsion becomes increasingly important at higher swimming speeds.
RESPONSE: we provided references.
-Page 18, line 426: I would remove the sentence on greater swimming speed being
associated with shorter distances between fish. This did not seem counterintuitive to
me and will likely not be counterintuitive to many readers because you often see tight
schooling when fish are swimming rapidly in response to a predator or being startled.
RESPONSE: we removed this sentence and edited this section.
-Fig. 1: I would suggest a better color scheme for Fig. 1 and maybe try to make the
colors uniform throughout the whole figure. With the colors presently used, you
cannot really distinguish the circles if the paper is printed in black and white, which is
very common. With three habitats, it seems like it would be quite easy to use a white,
gray, black color scheme to maximize contrast regardless of whether the figures are in
color or black and white and it would be easy to distinguish between sites within
habitats by using different symbols. It is often helpful to coordinate the color scheme
across figures. You seem to use different colors for the same samples in different
figures. Being consistent for most figures would make it easier for the reader to
interpret the results across figures.
RESPONSE: we changed the colour scheme as suggested in Fig. 1, and we changed
the other Figures to match the colour scheme to that of Fig. 1
-Fig. 1E: Specify that the Y axis is standard length. Length is too vague, could be
Total length.
RESPONSE: we changed the Y-axis title as suggested.
