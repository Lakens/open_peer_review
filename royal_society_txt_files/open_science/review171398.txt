“Isotopic niche reflects stress-induced variability in physiological status rather than dietary
divergence in consumers”
Overview:
The authors address a major assumption in isotope ecology: consumer signatures respond most
sensitively to dietary differences (in this case dietary niche reflecting d15N and d13C variability)
rather than environmental stressors. They conducted two experiments to understand i) if there is
a relationship between isotope composition and growth or reproductive performance and ii) can
intra-population variability of isotopic composition and growth or reproductive performance be
used to identify physiological stress.
They tested 5 hypothesis:
1) amphipods exposed to contaminants and parasites would have lower body mass, fecundity
and VE%,
2) amphipods with high-quality diet would have higher body mass, growth rate and condition
than those fed a low-quality diet,
3) amphipods with high quality diet and low-stress would have less variable isotopic signatures,
4) stress would lead to higher fractionation (and increased d15N and d13C) due to slow growth,
contamination, parasites, malnourishment, and
5) malnourishment or contamination would lead to increased intra-population variability in
physiological and isotopic values.
This is a critical need in isotope ecology and one that is rarely addressed experimentally. The ms
is well written and clearly makes the case for the importance of this topic in the introduction. The
title states that isotopic niche variability shows a greater response to stress than to dietary
divergence, yet this statement is not specifically addressed in the manuscript. Fig.2 A and B show
increased variation related to (A) contamination and (B) poor-quality diets, but the relative
variation due to the influence of diet vs stress is not addressed, and the overall message stated in
the title is diluted by a confusing mix of response and explanatory variables. Part of this comes
from the use of experimental results and model selection statistical techniques to assign
treatments to the amphipods from the treatments. This seems circular. Upon multiple reads, I see
the value in this approach for identifying the most important response variables indicating stress
in amphipods, but think it would need independent validation to be a main contribution of the
paper. The data appears to be available to discuss the relative variation due to diet vs. stress (as a
shift from initial – namely fig 2 and data in table 5 and supplements) but not discussed in detail. I
recommend the following to make the main points more accessible to the reader:
The manuscript could be improved by restructuring the paper to focus more specifically on the 2
questions stated in the intro: first, isotopic response to physiological variability and, second, use
of physiological and isotopic measurements to identify stressed populations.
Isotopic response to physiological variability:
Measures of d15N, d13C variability, and isotopic niche are the response variables of interest with
physiological variables as the explanatory variables. Alternatively, could frame as a test of
Layman niche metrics and consistently use this language (the switching of language throughout
the manuscript to describe response variables led to confusion on my part). This method is most
true to the title as described, and of greatest interest to the general field of isotope ecology.
Figures and tables that emphasize this are table 3, fig. 2, and fig. 3. Discussion of all of the
physiological responses to contamination and diet quality could be reduced to instead highlight
the effect of physiological variation on isotopic variation. The experimental treatments would be
3
discussed largely as generating variability, while the statistical methods of selecting
parsimonious models predicting isotope variation could be further emphasized. For example,
mechanisms explaining the value of body size for determining d13C in the contamination
experiment but not the diet quality experiment could be further discussed. The goal of this
restructuring would be to generate predictability in determining isotopic variation due to stress
vs other factors.
As it is written, there is a lot of discussion of physiological results and statistical methods
pertaining to Table 2 that could be simplified and moved to supplemental materials. The specific
portions pertaining to the relationship between isotopic niche variability as a function of
physiological parameters could be condensed to more clearly address question 1.
This organization would allow for further discussion of the multiple metrics of isotopic variation
(expanding on lines 345-349) presented in the manuscript that currently get little attention
beyond ED (e.g. Table 5), as well as the mechanisms driving these responses. Figures showing the
relationship between the isotopes (e.g. ED) and physiology (e.g. body size) could replace Fig. 1 to
further emphasize the importance of this relationship. As an example – Fig. 1 condenses a lot of
information into one plot that makes it difficult for a user of isotopes to identify the use for them
(me).
Identification of stressed populations with combo of physiological measurements and isotopes:
A second focused section could describe in detail the methods and utility of Table 4. This is a very
interesting finding of the paper, and of broad interest outside of the isotope ecology field.
Currently, much effort is put into showing that contaminants, food quality result in large
physiological and isotopic change, and then that these physiological and isotopic changes are
used to discriminate among treatments. This is circular, and mostly evidence of a large treatment
effect in the experiments. Are there from other studies that could be used to test this method? An
ideal workflow might be: controlled studies indicate ED and reproductive performance are
effective predictors of stress -> field data from a different collection -> logistic regression on field
data with ED, VE%, C:N -> effectiveness of method in identifying conditions at time of collection.
I know reality rarely works out that way… just a suggestion.
Specific comments:
- The d13C signature of the amphipods at the beginning of Experiment 2 is very depleted relative
to the final d13C in all feeding treatments. Yet the shift is not in the direction of the food sources
(diatoms and tetraphyll very depleted, Table S4.) as would be expected. The SD of the control and
lignin treatments seems to be the same as the initial SD, whereas the high-quality food treatments
converged on a value both in terms of increased mean and decreased SD. Is this a difference in
lipid correction among treatments (Table S4 doesn’t appear to be lipid corrected, but Table 1 is)?
This leads me to wonder if the large difference observed between Treatments at the end of the
experiment is more a function of diet assimilation than stress? Ways to address this might be to
test initial-final differences. The difference between the amphipod and the diet could also be
discussed in the context of the relative effect of stress.
- Line 75-76, slow growing animals will have more enriched d13C. line 390, “d13C values were
also hypothesised to be positively influenced by fast growth [26].” Conflicting statements of
hypothesized effect of growth rate on d13C. Line 233 also predicts enriched d13C in slow
growing amphipods
- Line 139 – were these initial animals starved for the 5 weeks? More details on the conditions
they experienced during those 5 weeks are needed. They could have changed considerably over 5
weeks of starvation.
- Line 168 – what is the mechanistic link between oxygen penetration depth and amphipod
performance? More detail would be helpful
- Line 191 – what is the justification for lipid correction? This may be important in order to be
consistent with isotopic niche methods, but in terms of testing isotopic methods assumptions,
there is an argument to be made to use uncorrected values.
4
- Line 197 – does population mean refer to all initial amphipods or within treatment?
- Line 238 – replacing an outlier with the mean biases the distribution, doesn’t it? I think it should
just be removed. Also the d15N of that outlier would be useful to show.
- Line 263 – does absolute deviation from population mean indicate initial amphipod signature?
- Line 313 –Looking at table 5 the exposure treatment is many times different than the high
quality vs low quality. are these statistically significantly different? And how do they relate to
differences observed in other studies comparing niches. i.e. are they the same order of magnitude
as those attributed to dietary difference, smaller or larger?
- Line 325 – survival was very low for a 5 week trial, what contributed to low survival (starvation
or cannibalism) and could it have effected the results? This is relevant to line 338 in which
amphipod mortality was the best predictor of d13C variation – what is the mechanistic link there?
- Line 330 – can you include initial values for comparison?
- Line 357 – very interesting!
- Line 359 – embryo viability and oxygen conditions are not causally linked to isotopic variability.
Either more discussion of this mechanism is needed or a rewording. Is it a nutritional/energetic
stress that leads to changes in VE% and isotopes? Or is it the embryo viability itself that causes
changes in amphipod isotope signatures?
- Line 368 – regarding the isotope incorporation rates – the signatures of the diets differed from
each other and the final amphipod signature suggesting they were not incorporating this diet.
This is confusing.
- Line 427 – is this data shown?
- Table 5 – As it is written it is difficult to determine if the parasitized amphipods are counted in
the exposure group and separately in the parasite group.
o Initial amphipods for both experiments were collected from the same location, yet the initial
values in Exp2 are multiple times higher. Does this influence interpretation of results, and is there
a potential explanation for that natural variability?
I'm happy to discuss in detail,

Stable isotope analysis has become a popular tool in ecological studies in the last few years. The
use of this tool, however, is riddled with simplifying assumptions that often times stem from our
ignorance of physiological processes and their effects on the isotope composition of consumers.
The present study helps to fill this gap by showing the effect of physiological stress caused by
environmental toxicity and poor nutrition on d15N and d13C values of a marine amphipod. More
important, it shows that interindividual variation in physiological responses to stress can be
translated into changes in isotope values of consumers. These changes were captured by
commonly used isotope-derived niche metrics aimed at quantifying variation in trophic position
and use of basal resource pools. As a consequence, one cannot safely ignore the physiological
condition of consumers when interpreting these niche metrics. The implications of these results
for food-web studies based on stable isotope data are very important. The present study is
therefore a major contribution to the ecological literature.
The experiment design is correct and the analysis are sound as far as I can tell. However, the
Methods and Results sections are extremely dense and hard to follow. The authors propose five
hypotheses to be tested and present a plethora of variables that are used in a variety of tests. Each
hypothesis involves several response and explanatory variables and the same variables are used
several times in different models. Some of these tests involve comparisons between treatments
and “initials”, whereas other tests compare treatments against controls, which is somewhat
confusing and redundant. The authors need to make a better job at organizing information in
these sections in order to improve clarity. Tables S2, S3, and specially S5 were very helpful.
l. 33-34: Delete “rather than a dietary”.
l. 45: Correct typo (“trophic position”).
l. 48: The phrase “resource breadth” is awkward, because it is the niche that has a breadth not the
resources.
l. 110: When did the experiment start?
l. 113: Be consistent with terminology, use either 'reference' or 'control' but not both. For example,
in Table S5 both terms are used as independent variables in H5 (Exp. 1 and Exp. 2).
l. 138-141: It's not clear to me what was done here. Were initials subject to the same treatments
(control and contaminated) as the other amphipods? After a five-week exposure is it safe to say
they represent an initial condition? Or were all amphipods subject to the same five-week
acclimation period before the start of the experiment? This clarification is important because
initials are used in several tests.
l. 159: It should be Table S4.
l. 176: It is nice that the authors provide citations in table S5 to support the inclusion of
explanatory variables, but they should provide a brief explanation in the text so that readers can
better evaluate model variables without the need to go to the original references for information.
l. 195: Equation 2 is inaccurate.
6
l. 197: Please explain how normalization was done.
l. 233: There are several inconsistencies between the main text and Table S5. For example, it is
said in the text that contaminant-exposed amphipods should have elevated d15N and d13C (H4),
but exposure is not listed as an independent variable in table S5. The same holds for ED (line 243),
which is not part of H1 and H2 in Table S5.
l. 254: Was survival estimated at the group level? It’s not clear why this variable was used as a
covariate.
l. 328-330: The authors say they measured isotopes from the initials to provide starting values for
isotopic niche metrics (l. 138), but initials are also used in comparisons involving performance
variables. Please clarify.
l. 335: Where’s the p-value for tetraphyll in Table 2?
l. 380-381: How does nitrogen imbalance change enrichment?
l. 391: I couldn’t find the result showing the positive relationship between d13C and RNA/DNA.
l. 436: It does not seem accurate to say that d15N values were influenced by embryo viability,
because both variables are actually responding to substrate toxicity.
l. 441: Any suggestions on how to do it?
l. 445: I'm not saying I don't agree with this, but why would individuals vary in physiological
status if they are living in the same environment and are subject to the same conditions?

“Isotopic niche reflects stress-induced variability in physiological status rather than dietary
divergence in consumers”
Overview:
The authors address a major assumption in isotope ecology: consumer signatures respond most
sensitively to dietary differences (in this case dietary niche reflecting d15N and d13C variability)
rather than environmental stressors. They conducted two experiments to understand i) if there is
a relationship between isotope composition and growth or reproductive performance and ii) can
intra-population variability of isotopic composition and growth or reproductive performance be
used to identify physiological stress.
They tested 5 hypothesis:
1) amphipods exposed to contaminants and parasites would have lower body mass, fecundity
and VE%,
2) amphipods with high-quality diet would have higher body mass, growth rate and condition
than those fed a low-quality diet,
3) amphipods with high quality diet and low-stress would have less variable isotopic signatures,
9
4) stress would lead to higher fractionation (and increased d15N and d13C) due to slow growth,
contamination, parasites, malnourishment, and
5) malnourishment or contamination would lead to increased intra-population variability in
physiological and isotopic values.
This is a critical need in isotope ecology and one that is rarely addressed experimentally. The ms
is well written and clearly makes the case for the importance of this topic in the introduction. The
title states that isotopic niche variability shows a greater response to stress than to dietary
divergence, yet this statement is not specifically addressed in the manuscript. Fig.2 A and B show
increased variation related to (A) contamination and (B) poor-quality diets, but the relative
variation due to the influence of diet vs stress is not addressed, and the overall message stated in
the title is diluted by a confusing mix of response and explanatory variables. Part of this comes
from the use of experimental results and model selection statistical techniques to assign
treatments to the amphipods from the treatments. This seems circular. Upon multiple reads, I see
the value in this approach for identifying the most important response variables indicating stress
in amphipods, but think it would need independent validation to be a main contribution of the
paper. The data appears to be available to discuss the relative variation due to diet vs. stress (as a
shift from initial – namely fig 2 and data in table 5 and supplements) but not discussed in detail. I
recommend the following to make the main points more accessible to the reader:
The manuscript could be improved by restructuring the paper to focus more specifically on the 2
questions stated in the intro: first, isotopic response to physiological variability and, second, use
of physiological and isotopic measurements to identify stressed populations.
Isotopic response to physiological variability:
Measures of d15N, d13C variability, and isotopic niche are the response variables of interest with

pertaining to Table 2 that could be simplified and moved to supplemental materials. The specific

This organization would allow for further discussion of the multiple metrics of isotopic variation
(expanding on lines 345-349) presented in the manuscript that currently get little attention
beyond ED (e.g. Table 5), as well as the mechanisms driving these responses. Figures showing the
relationship between the isotopes (e.g. ED) and physiology (e.g. body size) could replace Fig. 1 to
further emphasize the importance of this relationship. As an example – Fig. 1 condenses a lot of
information into one plot that makes it difficult for a user of isotopes to identify the use for them
(me).
Identification of stressed populations with combo of physiological measurements and isotopes:
A second focused section could describe in detail the methods and utility of Table 4. This is a very
interesting finding of the paper, and of broad interest outside of the isotope ecology field.
Currently, much effort is put into showing that contaminants, food quality result in large
physiological and isotopic change, and then that these physiological and isotopic changes are

I know reality rarely works out that way… just a suggestion.
Specific comments:
- The d13C signature of the amphipods at the beginning of Experiment 2 is very depleted relative
to the final d13C in all feeding treatments. Yet the shift is not in the direction of the food sources
(diatoms and tetraphyll very depleted, Table S4.) as would be expected. The SD of the control and
lignin treatments seems to be the same as the initial SD, whereas the high-quality food treatments
converged on a value both in terms of increased mean and decreased SD. Is this a difference in
lipid correction among treatments (Table S4 doesn’t appear to be lipid corrected, but Table 1 is)?
This leads me to wonder if the large difference observed between Treatments at the end of the
experiment is more a function of diet assimilation than stress? Ways to address this might be to
test initial-final differences. The difference between the amphipod and the diet could also be
discussed in the context of the relative effect of stress.
- Line 75-76, slow growing animals will have more enriched d13C. line 390, “d13C values were
also hypothesised to be positively influenced by fast growth [26].” Conflicting statements of
hypothesized effect of growth rate on d13C. Line 233 also predicts enriched d13C in slow
growing amphipods
- Line 139 – were these initial animals starved for the 5 weeks? More details on the conditions
they experienced during those 5 weeks are needed. They could have changed considerably over 5
weeks of starvation.
- Line 168 – what is the mechanistic link between oxygen penetration depth and amphipod
performance? More detail would be helpful
- Line 191 – what is the justification for lipid correction? This may be important in order to be
consistent with isotopic niche methods, but in terms of testing isotopic methods assumptions,
there is an argument to be made to use uncorrected values.
- Line 197 – does population mean refer to all initial amphipods or within treatment?
- Line 238 – replacing an outlier with the mean biases the distribution, doesn’t it? I think it should
just be removed. Also the d15N of that outlier would be useful to show.
- Line 263 – does absolute deviation from population mean indicate initial amphipod signature?
- Line 313 –Looking at table 5 the exposure treatment is many times different than the high
quality vs low quality. are these statistically significantly different? And how do they relate to
differences observed in other studies comparing niches. i.e. are they the same order of magnitude
as those attributed to dietary difference, smaller or larger?
- Line 325 – survival was very low for a 5 week trial, what contributed to low survival (starvation
or cannibalism) and could it have effected the results? This is relevant to line 338 in which
amphipod mortality was the best predictor of d13C variation – what is the mechanistic link there?
- Line 330 – can you include initial values for comparison?
- Line 357 – very interesting!
- Line 359 – embryo viability and oxygen conditions are not causally linked to isotopic variability.
Either more discussion of this mechanism is needed or a rewording. Is it a nutritional/energetic
stress that leads to changes in VE% and isotopes? Or is it the embryo viability itself that causes
changes in amphipod isotope signatures?
- Line 368 – regarding the isotope incorporation rates – the signatures of the diets differed from
each other and the final amphipod signature suggesting they were not incorporating this diet.
This is confusing.

- Table 5 – As it is written it is difficult to determine if the parasitized amphipods are counted in
the exposure group and separately in the parasite group.

l. 195: Equation 2 is inaccurate.
l. 197: Please explain how normalization was done.
l. 233: There are several inconsistencies between the main text and Table S5. For example, it is
said in the text that contaminant-exposed amphipods should have elevated d15N and d13C (H4),
but exposure is not listed as an independent variable in table S5. The same holds for ED (line 243),
which is not part of H1 and H2 in Table S5.
l. 254: Was survival estimated at the group level? It’s not clear why this variable was used as a
covariate.
l. 328-330: The authors say they measured isotopes from the initials to provide starting values for
isotopic niche metrics (l. 138), but initials are also used in comparisons involving performance
variables. Please clarify.
l. 335: Where’s the p-value for tetraphyll in Table 2?
l. 380-381: How does nitrogen imbalance change enrichment?
l. 391: I couldn’t find the result showing the positive relationship between d13C and RNA/DNA.
l. 436: It does not seem accurate to say that d15N values were influenced by embryo viability,
because both variables are actually responding to substrate toxicity.
l. 441: Any suggestions on how to do it?
l. 445: I'm not saying I don't agree with this, but why would individuals vary in physiological
status if they are living in the same environment and are subject to the same conditions?

General comments:
The authors have made an impressive effort to respond to the comments and the organization of
the manuscript has improved.
There is still a logical inconsistency that I think that be fixed. The article is framed as a test of
assumptions often ignored in stable isotope ecology – namely, the sources of fractionation. The
results indicate that niche metrics are sensitive to both contamination stress and growth rates (as
a function of physiological stress). Based on this, I conclude that a fundamental assumption used
in isotope studies, that fractionation is consistent and a single value is representative under all
conditions, is false. Much of the discussion is then focused on how isotopes can further be used to
identify stress in a wild population. I see a logical gap in this framework; the implications for
traditional interpretation of isotopic results are not explored beyond saying there are implications
(e.g. line 407). Can we still use isotopes as diet tracers?? Does incorporation of a physiological
stress element change conclusions from previous studies? This is an important question that is
raise but not resolved in the manuscript. For example, published papers cited by the authors use
layman niche metrics to determine trophic characteristics in M. affinis and sympatric species. Do
these conclusions need to be reassessed based on the results of the current findings? The
manuscript would be strengthened by focused discussion of these implications.
In the previous review, I asked for clarification of the relative effect of stress vs diet, and again
this is relevant. It was dropped from the title but still needs be addressed to test this assumption.
From this study, the effect of diet results in large shifts in mean isotopic signatures (Fig. 2B),
whereas the contaminant mostly resulted in more variation (Fig. 2A). Examining this in the
context of the test of the main assumption would be a major contribution to isotope ecology and
present a more logical framework to the manuscript. This comes back to the previous comment,
the magnitude of the stress effect should be contextualized to improve the use of isotopes as diet
tracers.
Identifying stressed populations based on the isotopes is another main theme in the revision. I
totally agree with the philosophy that isotopes should be measured along with other things like
growth, condition, etc. as an alternative assessment of ecological hypotheses. One of the
contributions of this paper is the statement that isotopes and physiological parameters should be
measured together to identify stressed populations (Line 68). Using these measurements to
separate the treatments that were previously shown to be different is still circular to me,
14
especially with ~70% success rate of identifying populations that we experimentally stressed
under controlled conditions. Figure S1 presents a more practical summary of the hypotheses
showing a mechanism of the variation (loss of body mass = greater variation, gain of body mass
in good food = lower variation particularly for nitrogen), and it is particularly relevant since body
size is the most consistent predictor of variation. A main takeaway from the paper is (from
response) “greater d13C shift after the diet switch (=start of the incubation) due to higher C
uptake and higher metabolism in fast-growing animals.” i.e. Factors that influence growth like
physiological stress, parasites, contamination have a large and measurable influence on
interpretation of isotopes.
Could data from experiment 1 be plotted the same way as S1 and incorporated into the
manuscript?
On a related note, The natural history information provided in the response to the initial review
is very helpful for interpreting these results in a more general sense. Thinking about the seasonal
cycle (as an general example based on your other work), amphipods depend heavily on the
spring phytoplankton bloom. During this time they are growing rapidly, developing gonads, and
storing lipids. Based the results of this study, you would predict, as you see, variability in
isotopic signature due to inter-individual growth and reproductive rates. However, mortality is
lower in the spring/summer suggesting lower stress. In winter, you sample adults at the same
stage of development in cold water so they are likely growing at slower (or at different rates)
compared to summer, and isotope niche metrics are narrower consistent with the growth
hypothesis. Mortality in this group is high suggesting high stress (is food also limiting?), yet
comparatively the niche metrics are much narrower than in the summer, thus inconsistent with
the stress hypothesis. For example, comparing Figure 2 A and B, the range in A is similar to the
range of the high quality food range in B. In Table 4, the seasonal differences are considerably
larger than the treatment effects. Set in this larger context, the stress hypothesis seems weaker
than the growth hypothesis. I recognize that the two experiments are discussed separately in the
manuscript because they are not directly comparable, and that I am extrapolating for the purpose
of discussion, but this comes back to an issue you address in the intro: assumptions that make
isotope methods useful are rarely tested and when they are, the results are discussed in the
context of a single experiment and not in a larger ecological context. To be truly effective tools in
ecology (e.g. line 67) we need evidence that the variation observed in any given context is linked
to some underlying process. Bringing in some of the natural history knowledge and Figure S1 to
the manuscript may help broaden the utility of these experimental results.
Supplementary fig. 1:
-diatoms appear to be ~4 per mil different than sediment in this plot but ~7per mil different in the
lipid correction plots in the response to reviews. Similarly the lignin d13C signature in the biplot
was ~9per mil depleted relative to sediment but only ~4 per mil in Fig. S1C. Can you reconcile
this difference?
-as amphipods grow in the diatom and tetraphyll treatments, the absolute change in d13C
decreases, yet these treatments are more enriched than the initial and reference animals and diets
in the biplot provided in the response to reviews. What are the start and end values of the
absolute change in d13C? How do they decreased from start to finish but become enriched
overall?
-in the biplots provided in the response to reviews, none of the animals fall within the resource
triangle produced by the diets, suggesting they are eating something else (by tradiational diet
attribution techniques). You would need a ~3permil d13C diet fractionation factor to fit the
tetraphyll treatment in the lipid corrected and a ~8permil fractionation factor for diatoms. Is this
relevant to the overall diet assumption? I’m still confused about how diatom-fed amphipods are
enriched relative to initials when the diet is so much more depleted.

Specific comments:
Intro: I think more discussion of the niche metrics in the intro would be helpful. Specifically, how
do your hypothesized results influence each metric, and why is ED used as an explanatory
variable in the experiments but not the other layman metrics.
Line 84: I recommend summarizing the 3 hypotheses in this paragraph for clarity.
Line 147: was experiment 2 run at the same temperature?
Line 328: body mass did not change during the experiment in reference or contaminant
treatment, yet body mass was lower in contaminant at the end of experiment. Does this mean
they were different at the start?
line 373 and 424: does this mean that amphipods in the wild are physiologically stressed?
Alternatively, the high quality diet induced the shift in niche metrics?
Line 404: in light of the seasonal differences mentioned in the general comments, discussion
could address relative effects of contaminants/parasites vs growth
Line 408-411: Here is the logical gap. Traditionally these results would be interpreted as
variability in diet (supported by Fig 2B). These results challenge this idea, but then turn around
and suggest a new use for isotopes without closure on the tested assumption. how do we
interpret variation as a response to stress from a wild population that may have variability in
developmental stage, growth rate, diet, stress exposure?
Line 454-475: paragraph could be consolidated to focus on isotope effects
Line 476: this is the best evidence of the stress hypothesis. How does the stressed population
compare to reference populations in spring and summer?

Associate Editor's comments:
Both reviewers were enthusiastic about the question tackled in this manuscript. Nevertheless, the
eviewers identified a few central issues that need to be resolved before they are able to better
assess the data and conclusions. I felt the reviews were fair and constructive. With much gratitude to
both reviewers, I invite the authors to make these substantial revisions.
Dear Editor,
We thank the reviewers for their comments, suggestions and generally very positive opinion of our
work. Their insightful comments on how to restructure the methods and results sections have helped
o improve the readability of the manuscript as well as nuanced interpretations of the results.
n the revised version, we have - as suggested by reviewer 1 - revised the title and restructured the
methods and results to better present how the research questions were addressed. In doing so, we
have revised the hypotheses, reduced their number from five to three and moved some of the
esults dealing with physiological effects to supplementary material. We have also rewritten the
ection on the statistical analysis and improved the correspondence between the hypothesis table
former Table S5 – now revised Table 1). These parts were also pointed out as difficult to follow by
Reviewer 2; now we are confident that it became easier to follow how the hypotheses are tested and
where the results for each test are presented in the manuscript. Moreover, as suggested by both
eviewers, we have clarified the reasons for statistical comparisons with initial animals or controls
hroughout the manuscript. Prompted by the suggestion of Reviewer 1 to compare initial and final
sotope values, we have made a new multi-panel figure (Fig S1) and a table (Table S7) with associated
est statistics which helps to confirm that fast-growing amphipods incorporate the added organic
matter. These data help the reader to understand the differences in d13C between the treatments.
We have also expanded the results section on physiological comparisons between the initial and final
values for amphipods in both experiments. Finally, we appreciate all the specific comments by both
eviewers; we have addressed all of them. Please see detailed response to each comment below (and
also the uploaded version of the response letter which contain figures). Our replies are numbered to
acilitate referencing within this letter. We hope you will find the revision satisfactory.

“Isotopic niche reflects stress-induced variability in physiological status rather than dietary
divergence in consumers”
Overview:
The authors address a major assumption in isotope ecology: consumer signatures respond most
ensitively to dietary differences (in this case dietary niche reflecting d15N and d13C variability)
ather than environmental stressors. They conducted two experiments to understand i) if there is a
elationship between isotope composition and growth or reproductive performance and ii) can intra-
population variability of isotopic composition and growth or reproductive performance be used to
dentify physiological stress.
They tested 5 hypothesis:
1) amphipods exposed to contaminants and parasites would have lower body mass, fecundity and
VE%,
2) amphipods with high-quality diet would have higher body mass, growth rate and condition than
hose fed a low-quality diet,
3) amphipods with high quality diet and low-stress would have less variable isotopic signatures,
4) stress would lead to higher fractionation (and increased d15N and d13C) due to slow growth,
contamination, parasites, malnourishment, and
5) malnourishment or contamination would lead to increased intra-population variability in
physiological and isotopic values.
This is a critical need in isotope ecology and one that is rarely addressed experimentally. The ms is
well written and clearly makes the case for the importance of this topic in the introduction.
First, we are grateful for all your insightful and helpful comments on how to improve the manuscript!
We have tried our best to address them. Your general comments were split up into different sections
with numbered replies; thereafter, the specific comments follow (also numbered).
The title states that isotopic niche variability shows a greater response to stress than to dietary
divergence, yet this statement is not specifically addressed in the manuscript. Fig.2 A and B show
ncreased variation related to (A) contamination and (B) poor-quality diets, but the relative variation
due to the influence of diet vs stress is not addressed, and the overall message stated in the title is
diluted by a confusing mix of response and explanatory variables. Part of this comes from the use of
experimental results and model selection statistical techniques to assign treatments to the
amphipods from the treatments. This seems circular. Upon multiple reads, I see the value in this
approach for identifying the most important response variables indicating stress in amphipods, but
hink it would need independent validation to be a main contribution of the paper. The data appears
o be available to discuss the relative variation due to diet vs. stress (as a shift from initial – namely
ig 2 and data in table 5 and supplements) but not discussed in detail.
1). We agree that the title was somewhat misleading and changed it to “Isotopic niche reflects stress-
nduced variability in physiological status” (see also reply 22). As explained in detail in reply 5, the
experimental design does not allow us to separate stress from the diet, since suboptimal diet indeed
s a stress in itself. This is also why we presented results from two experiments, where the
contaminant exposed amphipods were not food limited but still physiologically stressed due to the
oxic exposure. However, prompted by this comment we have analysed the isotope shift from initials
n relation to change in body mass during the diet-switch experiment. See figure S1 in the
upplementary material to the manuscript. Regarding the independent validation of data, please see
eply 4.
recommend the following to make the main points more accessible to the reader:
The manuscript could be improved by restructuring the paper to focus more specifically on the 2
questions stated in the intro: first, isotopic response to physiological variability and, second, use of
physiological and isotopic measurements to identify stressed populations.
2). We agree and have restructured as suggested. See specific replies to comments below on how the
estructuring has been carried out (i.e. reply 3 and reply 32).
sotopic response to physiological variability:
Measures of d15N, d13C variability, and isotopic niche are the response variables of interest with
physiological variables as the explanatory variables. Alternatively, could frame as a test of Layman
niche metrics and consistently use this language (the switching of language throughout the
manuscript to describe response variables led to confusion on my part). This method is most true to
he title as described, and of greatest interest to the general field of isotope ecology. Figures and
ables that emphasize this are table 3, fig. 2, and fig. 3. Discussion of all of the physiological responses
o contamination and diet quality could be reduced to instead highlight the effect of physiological
variation on isotopic variation. The experimental treatments would be discussed largely as generating
variability, while the statistical methods of selecting parsimonious models predicting isotope variation
could be further emphasized. For example, mechanisms explaining the value of body size for
determining d13C in the contamination experiment but not the diet quality experiment could be
urther discussed. The goal of this restructuring would be to generate predictability in determining
sotopic variation due to stress vs other factors.
As it is written, there is a lot of discussion of physiological results and statistical methods pertaining
o Table 2 that could be simplified and moved to supplemental materials. The specific portions
pertaining to the relationship between isotopic niche variability as a function of physiological
parameters could be condensed to more clearly address question 1.
This organization would allow for further discussion of the multiple metrics of isotopic variation
expanding on lines 345-349) presented in the manuscript that currently get little attention beyond
ED (e.g. Table 5), as well as the mechanisms driving these responses. Figures showing the
elationship between the isotopes (e.g. ED) and physiology (e.g. body size) could replace Fig. 1 to
urther emphasize the importance of this relationship. As an example – Fig. 1 condenses a lot of
nformation into one plot that makes it difficult for a user of isotopes to identify the use for them
me).
3). In the revised version we have, as suggested, restructured the manuscript to focus on the two
overall research questions. The title is revised as explained in reply 1 (also following reply 22).
To better focus on the main results “highlight the effect of physiological variation on isotopic
variation” we have renamed the former hypotheses 1 and 2 (which dealt with physiological
endpoints only) to expectations (i.e. that treatments have an effect on amphipod physiology) on
which the other hypotheses (former 3-5, now renamed and revised to hypotheses 1-3) are built.
Namely, that physiology can be linked to isotope composition and isotope niche size. By doing so, we
could also move former Table 2, which presented mainly the results of the physiological endpoints to
upplementary material (Table S6 in the revised version). We did, however, extract the isotope
esults from this table (treatment effects on “euclidean distance”) and kept these results in the main
manuscript (Table 3 revised version) to focus on the isotope variation results (Hypothesis 1; revised
Hypotheses are listed in the overview of statistical models, Table 1).
Concerning replacing Figure 1 (PLS-bagplot) with figures showing univariate relationships between
sotopes and physiology: we are a little hesitant in doing so since univariate relationships are rarely
trong enough to work as useful displays. The reviewer himself actually writes: “Discussion of all of
he physiological responses to contamination and diet quality could be reduced to instead highlight
he effect of physiological variation on isotopic variation..” Hence, this argument actually supports
keeping Figure 1A and B since they summarize the physiological variation between treatments (i.e.
arge variation in physiological endpoints in stressed treatments). Moreover, in the old version the
igure reference to Fig 1 had disappeared from the results section, so it is not strange that reviewer 1
did not understand the value of the figure before. We understand however that Fig 1 may be
perceived as complicated if you are not familiar with PLS, therefore the relevance of this figure is
clarified on lines 262-265.
dentification of stressed populations with combo of physiological measurements and isotopes:
A second focused section could describe in detail the methods and utility of Table 4. This is a very
nteresting finding of the paper, and of broad interest outside of the isotope ecology field.
Currently, much effort is put into showing that contaminants, food quality result in large
physiological and isotopic change, and then that these physiological and isotopic changes are used to
discriminate among treatments. This is circular, and mostly evidence of a large treatment effect in
he experiments. Are there from other studies that could be used to test this method? An ideal
workflow might be: controlled studies indicate ED and reproductive performance are effective
predictors of stress -> field data from a different collection -> logistic regression on field data with
ED, VE%, C:N -> effectiveness of method in identifying conditions at time of collection. I know reality
arely works out that way… just a suggestion.
4). We agree that independent verification would generalize on the potential usefulness of these
predictors, but since the manuscript is complex already (having data from two experiments with
multiple treatments) and a “myriad of tests” (quoting reviewer 2), we deem this suggestion to be too
ambitious in an already “extremely dense” method section (also quote from reviewer 2). We are
however working on field data on amphipod reproduction and isotopic niche, and we will revisit this
approach in that data set for another manuscript in prep.
Specific comments:
The d13C signature of the amphipods at the beginning of Experiment 2 is very depleted relative
o the final d13C in all feeding treatments. Yet the shift is not in the direction of the food sources
diatoms and tetraphyll very depleted, Table S4.) as would be expected. The SD of the control and
ignin treatments seems to be the same as the initial SD, whereas the high-quality food treatments
converged on a value both in terms of increased mean and decreased SD. Is this a difference in lipid
correction among treatments (Table S4 doesn’t appear to be lipid corrected, but Table 1 is)? This
eads me to wonder if the large difference observed between Treatments at the end of the
experiment is more a function of diet assimilation than stress? Ways to address this might be to test
nitial-final differences. The difference between the amphipod and the diet could also be discussed in
he context of the relative effect of stress.
5). Yes, values in the old version of Table S4 were not lipid corrected, but we have now moved the
amphipod data from this table (which focused on the added organic matter) to Table 2 in the revised
manuscript and here they have been lipid corrected to allow comparisons with experimental animals.
See reply 9 for the rationale behind the lipid correction.
Following reply 1, we have illustrated the initial – final difference in isotope data in a new figure (Fig
S1 and Table S7 for accompanying statistics) to help the reader understand the direction of change in
he isotope values during the experiments (this figure is shown below including an extended figure
egend). The conclusion here is that fast-growing amphipods had incorporated more carbon and
nitrogen than slow-growing amphipods from the same treatment. It is important, however, to
emember that the absolute differences are largely driven by isotopic signature of the sediment or
added food and that the isotope signature of the food sources might have changed during the
experimental conditions (see reply 17). This is the reasons why we did not initially focus on initial-
inal differences. However we agree that the new figure and new statistical test are important for
nterpreting hypothesis 2; an increase in 13C due to starvation can be only relevant if the animals
were losing mass (=starved). If they were slowly growing (which they were in our study), then this
easoning does not apply and we can discard this mechanism as not applicable. This is now clarified
n the revised hypothesis 2b (see section 3.4.3 and Table 1).

2 - In good-food treatments, there was a

is in line with the hypothesized greater

whereas diatom-animals have not; this is
again due to the fact that diatoms were

tetraphyll in terms of their d13C. Therefore,

it is not possible to infer any differences in
fractionation, only in the C-uptake rate.

% C h a n g e in b io m a s s in d13C was weakly positive (Table 2), in
concert with slow or no growth. These
animals were not starving (most probably),
but were nutritionally challenged. They did not eat lignin. Therefore, it cannot be used as a test for
he hypothesis of the negative relationship between d13C and body condition in starved animals
hat break down lipids to survive. What we observed here is very close to the meta-analysis by Doi
et al. (2017), who found that higher loss of 13C is positively related to the loss of body weight. The
eason for the observed trend would be intensified recycling of 12C and re-arrangement of fatty
acids (FA) leading to different FA composition in animals exposed to good food and growing at the
ame rate. FA composition would affect both lipid and bulk 13C (Godin et al. 2013). No appreciable
changes in 13C or size were observed in sediment. If anything, the data cloud resembled that in
ignin, and the reasoning behind isotopic change would like to be the same.
Line 75-76, slow growing animals will have more enriched d13C. line 390, “d13C values were
also hypothesised to be positively influenced by fast growth [26].” Conflicting statements of
hypothesized effect of growth rate on d13C. Line 233 also predicts enriched d13C in slow growing
amphipods
6). The confusion stems partly from terms relating to mixing fractionation and magnitude of d13C
values have sometimes been used interchangeably. Fractionation for 13C is not necessarily the same
as change in direction. In the revised version we have been more stringent when using these terms.
See reply 5, including figure where we have addressed mechanisms behind “d13C – growth”
elationship in varying growth conditions (Table 1: hypothesis 2b in the revised manuscript). From
eply 5: “the hypothesized increase in 13C due to starvation can be only relevant if the animals were
osing mass (=starved). If they were slowly growing (which they were in our study), then this
easoning does not apply and we can discard this mechanism as not applicable. This is now clarified
n the revised hypothesis 2b (see section 3.4.3 and Table 1).”
Line 139 – were these initial animals starved for the 5 weeks? More details on the conditions
hey experienced during those 5 weeks are needed. They could have changed considerably over 5
weeks of starvation.
7). The acclimatization does not imply starvation, amphipods were incubated with field collected
ediment containing nutrients and should reflect in situ conditions at this time of the year (autumn,
he sediment contains organic matter from seasonal blooms). In experiment 2, the experimental
duration of five weeks did not change the isotope signatures of amphipods in the reference
reatment from the initial signature (Table 2, see also figure 2 in reply 9), supporting the use of the
erm “initials” in experiment 1.
Line 168 – what is the mechanistic link between oxygen penetration depth and amphipod
performance? More detail would be helpful
8). The study species Monoporeia affinis is very sensitive to oxygen deficiency (e.g. Modig and
Olafsson 1998); when exposed to sub-lethally low oxygen concentrations, these amphipods reduce
wimming and feeding activity (e.g. Ejdung et al 2008), which may change d13C values. A reference to
Ejdung et al. 2008 is added to lines 296-292 under Statistics section 3.4.3 to justify using this
predictor in the analyses.
Line 191 – what is the justification for lipid correction? This may be important in order to be
consistent with isotopic niche methods, but in terms of testing isotopic methods assumptions, there
s an argument to be made to use uncorrected values.
9). Amphipods are extremely lipid-rich and their d13C values need to be lipid-corrected to interpret
rophic information derived from field data (e.g. Karlson et al 2015 Sci rep). All amphipods in this
tudy had much higher C:N ratio than the threshold of 3.6 identified by Post et al (2002) for making a
decision whether to normalize or not, the ratio was often as high as 6. This is now clarified on lines
197-198. Fat-correction is a conservative approach; if not using fat-corrected values the standard
deviation (SD) for isotope values are even larger in stressed treatments (also shown as larger isotope
niche values compared to non-stressed treatments, compare size of SD in figure 2 below). Moreover,
f not performing lipid-correction, growth/respiration effects on amphipod d13C could not be
detected.
Figure 2 (reply 9). Isotope biplots of amphipods and the organic matter they were incubated with
food: diatoms and tetraphyll, lignin; a refractory carbon source not intended as a food) in
Experiment 2. The isotope signatures of organic matter is shown as orange symbols and amphipods
are black symbols (values are mean and standard deviation, SD). The right panel shows amphipod
values without lipid (fat)-correction of d13C values (Post et al 2002). Although the overall pattern is
imilar, the SD of d13C are much larger. d15N value for lignin-material is absent due to the nearly zero
N-content of this material.
Line 197 – does population mean refer to all initial amphipods or within treatment?
10). Within a treatment; the sentence is now clarified. See also reply 12.
Line 238 – replacing an outlier with the mean biases the distribution, doesn’t it? I think it should
ust be removed. Also the d15N of that outlier would be useful to show.
11). Removing this value means removing all the paired physiological data as well, which would
educe the entire data set. The replacing this value with the mean was justified by the fact that it did
not change the data distribution (see Fig 3, below). Removal of the value (or individual) will not
change the results of the statistical models (all tests were repeated with removal).

Line 263 – does absolute deviation from population mean indicate initial amphipod signature?
12. No, deviations are relative to the treatment means (so-called anomalies) were calculated for each
reatment separately. Initials are not included in these calculations. We were not interested in the
absolute differences between the treatments, because they were largely driven by the differences in
he isotopic signature of the sediment or the added food (Hypothesis 2, see also figure 1 in reply 5 in
his document). What we were after is the change that occurred during the exposure and to get a
measure of this change; therefore the normalization was necessary. This is now clarified on lines 285-
289 under Statistics (before introducing [revised] hypothesis 2)
Line 313 –Looking at table 5 the exposure treatment is many times different than the high
quality vs low quality. are these statistically significantly different? And how do they relate to
differences observed in other studies comparing niches. i.e. are they the same order of magnitude as
hose attributed to dietary difference, smaller or larger?
13). Differences in the niche size between the experiments are most likely related to the fact that the
animals were collected at different times of the year; experiment 1 was carried out in winter using
ully-grown mature females, experiment 2 was carried out in summer using subadults that were still
growing and developing their gonads. In summer, the isotope niche size of the amphipods reflected
1) diverse organic matter originated from phytoplankton blooms settled down (e.g. Karlson et al.
2014, 2015), and (2) the different growth status of individuals (this study). Accordingly, the niche size
of the amphipods from the diet experiment was also more similar to that in summer amphipods (e.g.
Karlson et al. 2014), whereas the contaminant exposure experiment, which was performed during
winter, had narrower niches, which also agrees with the recently observed niche values of the
amphipods collected in winter (in prep.). This topic is not addressed in the Discussion, because the
comparisons are only made within experimental treatments, not between the experiments.
Line 325 – survival was very low for a 5 week trial, what contributed to low survival (starvation
or cannibalism) and could it have effected the results? This is relevant to line 338 in which amphipod
mortality was the best predictor of d13C variation – what is the mechanistic link there?
14). Mortality is often lower in experiments conducted in summer (e.g., Karlson et al. 2010; Bianchi
et al. 2000), which explains the difference in mortality between the experiments. The mortality was
ncluded as a predictor to evaluate the effects of size-selective mortality or scavenging on dead
decomposing amphipods as a supplementary food source; both phenomena were plausible in this
experimental design. The rationale for inclusion is clarified on lines 293-294.
Line 330 – can you include initial values for comparison?
15). Yes, values are provided in Table 2 of the revised version.
Line 357 – very interesting!
<U+F04A>
Line 359 – embryo viability and oxygen conditions are not causally linked to isotopic variability.
Either more discussion of this mechanism is needed or a rewording. Is it a nutritional/energetic stress
hat leads to changes in VE% and isotopes? Or is it the embryo viability itself that causes changes in
amphipod isotope signatures?
16). We agree and have revised the sentence for clarification. See also reply 38.
Line 368 – regarding the isotope incorporation rates – the signatures of the diets differed from
each other and the final amphipod signature suggesting they were not incorporating this diet. This is
confusing.
17). Please see reply 5, including the new figure (fig S1 in the supplementary material) showing the
change in isotope values (from the initials) relative to growth of the animal. It is now clear that fast-
growing amphipods approached the isotope value of the added tetraphyll, amphipods fed diatoms
had a similar trend although they did not reach isotopic equilibrium with the new diet within the
ime frame of the experiment. These illustrations are accompanied by statistical testing confirming
hat fast-growing individuals have a higher uptake of C and N from the added food, resulting in a
arger shift in d13C than slow-growing amphipods (results in Table S7).
Line 427 – is this data shown?
18). Yes, the data can be found in table 2 and table S1, a reference to these tables are added to help
he reader.
Table 5 – As it is written it is difficult to determine if the parasitized amphipods are counted in
he exposure group and separately in the parasite group.
19). Table caption is revised to clarify that parasitized amphipods are not included in the exposure
group in this comparison (this table is now table 4 in the revised version).
o Initial amphipods for both experiments were collected from the same location, yet the initial
values in Exp2 are multiple times higher. Does this influence interpretation of results, and is there a
potential explanation for that natural variability?
20). Please, see reply 13. In short, this difference can be attributed to the temporal differences
experiment 1 carried out in winter with adult amphipods, experiment 2 in summer with growing
ubadults). It doesn’t influence the interpretation, because the experimental treatments are only
within an experiment and not between the experiments.

Stable isotope analysis has become a popular tool in ecological studies in the last few years. The use
of this tool, however, is riddled with simplifying assumptions that often times stem from our
gnorance of physiological processes and their effects on the isotope composition of consumers. The
present study helps to fill this gap by showing the effect of physiological stress caused by
environmental toxicity and poor nutrition on d15N and d13C values of a marine amphipod. More
mportant, it shows that interindividual variation in physiological responses to stress can be
ranslated into changes in isotope values of consumers. These changes were captured by commonly
used isotope-derived niche metrics aimed at quantifying variation in trophic position and use of basal
esource pools. As a consequence, one cannot safely ignore the physiological condition of consumers
when interpreting these niche metrics. The implications of these results for food-web studies based
on stable isotope data are very important. The present study is therefore a major contribution to
he ecological literature.
The experiment design is correct and the analysis are sound as far as I can tell. However, the
Methods and Results sections are extremely dense and hard to follow. The authors propose five
hypotheses to be tested and present a plethora of variables that are used in a variety of tests. Each
hypothesis involves several response and explanatory variables and the same variables are used
everal times in different models. Some of these tests involve comparisons between treatments and
“initials”, whereas other tests compare treatments against controls, which is somewhat confusing
and redundant. The authors need to make a better job at organizing information in these sections in
order to improve clarity. Tables S2, S3, and specially S5 were very helpful.
21) Firstly, thanks for the thorough reading of the manuscript and good comments. As also suggested
by reviewer 1 (reply 3) and brought up in reply 32, the methods and results section are now
estructured, and we are confident that these sections in the revised version are easier to follow. We
have, for example, moved table S5 to the manuscript (Table 1 now) and revised and harmonized the
hypotheses in the text and table 1. Furthermore, we clarified the need for comparisons of the
experiment results with the controls and - when appropriate - with the initials; see reply 5 for an
sotope example, and reply 34 for comparisons with initials regarding the physiological data. These
clarifications are also mirrored in the Discussion (section 5.1).
. 33-34: Delete “rather than a dietary”.
22). Revised as suggested. See also the revised title.
. 45: Correct typo (“trophic position”).
23). Corrected.
. 48: The phrase “resource breadth” is awkward, because it is the niche that has a breadth not the
esources.
24). Revised as suggested (resource breadth replaced with niche breadth)
. 110: When did the experiment start?
25). The experiment started in late October, this information is added on line 111.
. 113: Be consistent with terminology, use either 'reference' or 'control' but not both. For example,
n Table S5 both terms are used as independent variables in H5 (Exp. 1 and Exp. 2).
26). The reason for initially using the term “reference” [sediment] in experiment 1, rather than
“control” [sediment] as in exp 2, is that the reference sediment was not a true control sediment, in
he sense that the sediment originated from two different localities and differed slightly in isotopic
and nutritional composition. To avoid confusion we have renamed all control sediment to reference
ediment in both experiments since “reference” is a more general term than “control”.
. 138-141: It's not clear to me what was done here. Were initials subject to the same treatments
control and contaminated) as the other amphipods? After a five-week exposure is it safe to say they
epresent an initial condition? Or were all amphipods subject to the same five-week acclimation
period before the start of the experiment? This clarification is important because initials are used in
everal tests.
27). Yes, unfortunately there are no true initials form this experiment. However, similar to the
eference treatment in experiment 2, the “initials” were taken after five weeks of acclimatization,
and also before adding the food; therefore, they were operationally considered as initials (see reply
7). We found that the five-week exposure in experiment 2 did not change the isotope signatures of
amphipods in the reference treatment from the initial signature, suggesting that use of animals
reated in the same way as initials in experiment 1 is acceptable (Table 2). The very similar niche
metrics between these groups of initials (see figures 3 and supplementary figures of Layman metrics,
also table 4 in the revised version) support this too. Importantly, in the niche metric comparisons, the
exposed-final values are compared to the exposed-initials and same was done for reference-end and
eference-initial comparisons. This is now clarified on lines 142-143.
. 159: It should be Table S4.
28). Corrected.
. 176: It is nice that the authors provide citations in table S5 to support the inclusion of explanatory
variables, but they should provide a brief explanation in the text so that readers can better evaluate
model variables without the need to go to the original references for information.
29). The confusion above has arisen, because of reference to the wrong table (see reply 28). This is
corrected now. Table S5 is referred to under Statistics, however, in the revised version we have
moved table S5 to the manuscript (now Table 1). The text in this section is also restructured to allow
or references in the text rather than in table footnotes.
. 195: Equation 2 is inaccurate.
30). Corrected. (a as in anomalies).
. 197: Please explain how normalization was done.
31). We added within treatments in the sentence below (lines 203-206 in manuscript) to clarify this.
“The d13C and d15N values were normalized by calculating anomalies from the population mean
within treatments to remove the effect of different isotope baselines in the different sediments
Experiment 1) or feeding treatments (Experiment 2).”
. 233: There are several inconsistencies between the main text and Table S5. For example, it is said in
he text that contaminant-exposed amphipods should have elevated d15N and d13C (H4), but
exposure is not listed as an independent variable in table S5. The same holds for ED (line 243), which
s not part of H1 and H2 in Table S5.
32) Following the extensive restructuring (see reply 2-3), we have rewritten the text under the
Statistics and revised table S5 (now Table 1). The number of hypothesis was reduced and they were
evised; hopefully, it became clear why the specific statistical approaches were needed for each
hypothesis (see new hypothesis-specific sections under Statistics and Table 1). In short, for
hypothesis 1, we were specifically testing for the treatment effect on ED (variability in isotope
ignatures), whereas in hypothesis 2 we tested whether deteriorated physiology were linked to
enriched isotope values. Here, we were not interested in the absolute differences in isotope
ignatures between the treatments, because they were largely driven by isotopic signature of the
ediment or added food, but rather the change that occurred during the experiment. Hence, the
anomalies were calculated within treatments to remove the treatment effect. This is clarified on lines
285-289 under Statistics (before introducing [revised] hypothesis 2). See also reply 12.
. 254: Was survival estimated at the group level? It’s not clear why this variable was used as a
covariate.
33). Yes, survival (mortality) was measured at the end of the experiment in every experimental
container. Mortality was included as a predictor in some of the statistical analyses to control for
potential size-selective mortality and/or scavenging effects on isotope signals. We have justified this
on lines 243-245 in the revised version.
. 328-330: The authors say they measured isotopes from the initials to provide starting values for
sotopic niche metrics (l. 138), but initials are also used in comparisons involving performance
variables. Please clarify.
34). In the revised version, we have clarified when the data (isotope or physiological) were compared
with controls or with initial values, (see e.g. reply 32). For physiological data, (performance)
comparisons to the initials were needed to demonstrate that the animals were growing during
experimental conditions; this data can be found in Table 2 and the test results in Table S5. Table S5
ets a scene for the discussion related to the 13C and 15N responses to growth; importantly all animals
were growing (not starving) but their C allocation was lower in the poor-food treatment (most likely,
ess lipid-more protein). Also, the RNA/DNA ratio indicated that the protein synthetic capacity was
ower in the poor-food treatments compared to the initial values, whereas it was activated in the
good-food treatments. All these conclusions are needed to interpret the 13C and 15N dynamics. The
esults section is expanded to include the comparison of the physiological variables between the
nitial and the post-exposure values in the revised version, including the Discussion section 5.1.
. 335: Where’s the p-value for tetraphyll in Table 2?
35). Missing p-value is inserted.
. 380-381: How does nitrogen imbalance change enrichment?
36). It has been hypothesized that nitrogen isotopic discrimination should decrease as dietary protein
quality increases (Roth and Hobson 2000) and field data from our study species also support this
hypothesis (Karlson et al. 2015). To clarify this, we have rewritten the sentence and included a new
eference: “This may have facilitated nitrogen imbalance in the amphipods and a higher incidence of
rans- and deamination, with subsequent enrichment in consumer d15N values…” (Fuller et al. 2005).
. 391: I couldn’t find the result showing the positive relationship between d13C and RNA/DNA.
37). This was not included in the best-fit model and therefore not shown; the sentence is now
evised to clarify this.
. 436: It does not seem accurate to say that d15N values were influenced by embryo viability,
because both variables are actually responding to substrate toxicity.
38. The sentence is revised, we agree with the reviewers comment.
. 441: Any suggestions on how to do it?
39). A sentence is added on the challenge of including parasite data in field and experimental studies;
ines 492-495.
. 445: I'm not saying I don't agree with this, but why would individuals vary in physiological status if
hey are living in the same environment and are subject to the same conditions?
40). Phenotypic plasticity is a key mechanism for coping with environmental variability. Reaction
norm and multiple genotype x environment interactions lead to what we call a natural variability
within a population. This variability is reflected in physiological, biochemical and isotopic diversity
exhibited in both field and experimental conditions.

Keywords: trophic niche, stable isotopes, environmental contaminants, nutritional status, growth
and body condition, invertebrates
Abstract: The isotopic niche has become an established concept in trophic ecology. However, the
assumptions behind this approach have rarely been evaluated. The evidence is accumulating that
physiological stress can affect both magnitude and inter-individual variability of the isotopic
ignature in consumers via alterations in metabolic pathways. We hypothesized that stress factors
inadequate nutrition, parasite infestations, and exposure to toxic substances or varying oxygen
conditions) might lead to suboptimal physiological performance and altered stable isotope
ignatures. The latter can be misinterpreted as alterations in isotopic niche. This hypothesis was
ested by inducing physiological stress in the deposit-feeding amphipod Monoporeia affinis exposed
o either different feeding regimes or contaminated sediments. In the amphipods, we measured
body condition indices or reproductive output to assess growth status and d13C and d15N values to
derive isotope niche metrics. As hypothesized, greater isotopic niche estimates were derived for the
tressed animals compared to the control groups. Moreover, the d15N values were influenced by
body size, reproductive status and parasite infestations, while d13C values were influenced by body
ize, oxygen conditions and survival. Using regression analysis with isotope composition and growth
variables as predictors, we were able to discriminate between the amphipods exposed to
nutritionally or chemically stressful conditions and those in the control groups. Thus, interpretation
of isotopic niche can be confounded by natural or anthropogenic stressors that may induce an
apparent rather than a dietary change in isotopic niche. These findings stress the importance of
ncluding measures of growth and health status when evaluating stable isotope data in food web
tudies.

Appendix B
Dear Editor,
We are thankful for the effort you and the reviewers have put into this manuscript. The last round
of comments have further improved clarity and the take-home message of our work; Isotopic niche
does not fully represent the dietary niche but can potentially be used as a population level response
of environmental change. Since we have addressed all the comments and questions brought up by
he reviewer, both in replies 1-16 below and in the manuscript, we are now confident that the
manuscript is acceptable for publication.
On behalf of all the coauthors,
Agnes Karlson

General comments:
The authors have made an impressive effort to respond to the comments and the organization of
he manuscript has improved.
There is still a logical inconsistency that I think that be fixed. The article is framed as a test of
assumptions often ignored in stable isotope ecology – namely, the sources of fractionation. The
esults indicate that niche metrics are sensitive to both contamination stress and growth rates (as a
unction of physiological stress). Based on this, I conclude that a fundamental assumption used in
sotope studies, that fractionation is consistent and a single value is representative under all
conditions, is false. Much of the discussion is then focused on how isotopes can further be used to
dentify stress in a wild population. I see a logical gap in this framework; the implications for
raditional interpretation of isotopic results are not explored beyond saying there are implications
e.g. line 407). Can we still use isotopes as diet tracers?? Does incorporation of a physiological
tress element change conclusions from previous studies? This is an important question that is raise
but not resolved in the manuscript. For example, published papers cited by the authors use layman
niche metrics to determine trophic characteristics in M. affinis and sympatric species. Do these
conclusions need to be reassessed based on the results of the current findings? The manuscript
would be strengthened by focused discussion of these implications.
Reply 1: Many thanks again for careful reading and for suggestions on how to further improve the
ext. We have expanded on the implications for the traditional use of isotopes in ecology (as diet
racers) in the discussion (lines 416-422 and 462-465 and 531-535) but also highlighted the potential
of using isotopic niche as a population level response to environmental change in e.g. monitoring
programs (lines 419-422). It is indeed likely that, in light of our new findings, interpretations of
sotopic niche dynamics from older studies might need to be re-evaluated. This is especially likely to
be an issue in ecotoxicological surveys where organisms have been exposed to contaminants or if
hey have been stressed in other ways. Concerning our own previous field studies on the isotopic
niches in M. affinis, we have added a sentence (lines 462-465), stating that re-interpretation might
be needed. In this particular study (Karlson et 2014) we compared niche metrics before and after a
easonal summer bloom and our current study suggest that the observed niche expansion after the
ummer bloom can, at least, partly be explained by suboptimal feeding conditions. To sum up, we
ecommend isotope analyses to be complemented with other non-isotopic methods when
assessing diet and to also measure body condition or other endpoints indicative of physiological
tatus when interpreting stable isotope data (see inserted sentences on lines 531-535).
n the previous review, I asked for clarification of the relative effect of stress vs diet, and again this is
elevant. It was dropped from the title but still needs be addressed to test this assumption. From this
tudy, the effect of diet results in large shifts in mean isotopic signatures (Fig. 2B), whereas the
contaminant mostly resulted in more variation (Fig. 2A). Examining this in the context of the test of
he main assumption would be a major contribution to isotope ecology and present a more logical
ramework to the manuscript. This comes back to the previous comment, the magnitude of the
tress effect should be contextualized to improve the use of isotopes as diet tracers.
Reply 2: In Table 4 in the manuscript, the niche metrics can be compared to each other, but such a
comparison was not highlighted in the discussion in the last version. In the revised version, we have
clarified that the environmental stressors tested have the potential to change niche metrics
everal-fold (lines 482, 506-506 and 542-545); this would have large implications for interpretation in
he field. Also, diet does not only cause a shift in mean isotopic signatures but also an expansion or
compression (e.g. fig 3B). We have clarified this on line 424 and 462-465. The relative magnitude in
sotopic niche size might be strongest for starvation, but parasite infestations and contaminant
exposure changed the nitrogen range as much as starvation did (lines 506-506 and 542-545). See
also lines 509-514 for a comparison between the experiments.
dentifying stressed populations based on the isotopes is another main theme in the revision. I totally
agree with the philosophy that isotopes should be measured along with other things like growth,
condition, etc. as an alternative assessment of ecological hypotheses. One of the contributions of this
paper is the statement that isotopes and physiological parameters should be measured together to
dentify stressed populations (Line 68). Using these measurements to separate the treatments that
were previously shown to be different is still circular to me, especially with ~70% success rate of
dentifying populations that we experimentally stressed under controlled conditions. Figure S1
presents a more practical summary of the hypotheses showing a mechanism of the variation (loss of
body mass = greater variation, gain of body mass in good food = lower variation particularly for
nitrogen), and it is particularly relevant since body size is the most consistent predictor of variation. A
main takeaway from the paper is (from response) “greater d13C shift after the diet switch (=start of
he incubation) due to higher C uptake and higher metabolism in fast-growing animals.” i.e. Factors
hat influence growth like physiological stress, parasites, contamination have a large and measurable
nfluence on interpretation of isotopes. Could data from experiment 1 be plotted the same way as
S1 and incorporated into the manuscript?
Reply 3: The reason we did not plot data from the contaminant experiment in the same way as in the
diet experiment (e.g. having a figure S1b), is that growth was non-significant in the contaminant
experiment (growth was not expected since females were already carrying embryos and will die after
embryo release). Therefore, the x-axis in a similar figure for the contaminant experiment would only
epresent the anomalies in biomass used in other statistical analyses (results in Table 5) rather than
growth (and hence confuse the reader). We have considered at length moving figure S1 into the
manuscript but decided that it would take focus away from the main point of the paper; that
different environmental stressors cause higher variability in several of the physiological variables
measured (growth, body condition and reproductive success) and, importantly, expand isotope niche
metrics regardless of the initial and end isotope values (therefore the consistent use of anomalies
hroughout the manuscript). We were only interested in the changes that occurred during the
experiment and not interested in the absolute differences in isotope signatures between the
reatments. The reason for “adding” Fig S1, which uses end –initial values was to specifically
nuance the interpretation of one of the hypothesis in d13C-changes in one of the experiments (H2
n Experiment 2); Fig S1 and accompanying tests does not address any of the main hypothesis in
tself (those listed in Table 1). Also, as explained in reply 6 below, this experiment was not designed
as a proper diet switch experiment with the aim of reaching isotopic equilibrium and assess the
absolute fractionation between different food sources. To assume isotopic equilibrium, animals
hould preferably have increased biomass several-fold (e.g. Ek et al 2015), i.e. following amphipods
during an even longer experiment at higher temperature. Therefore we think it might be slightly
misleading for the readers to put a large emphasis on this figure in the main manuscript. Regarding
he lower success rate for classification in the contaminant experiment, see reply 14.
On a related note, natural history information provided in the response to the initial review is very
helpful for interpreting these results in a more general sense. Thinking about the seasonal cycle (as
an general example based on your other work), amphipods depend heavily on the spring
phytoplankton bloom. During this time they are growing rapidly, developing gonads, and storing
ipids. Based the results of this study, you would predict, as you see, variability in isotopic signature
due to inter-individual growth and reproductive rates. However, mortality is lower in the
pring/summer suggesting lower stress. In winter, you sample adults at the same stage of
development in cold water so they are likely growing at slower (or at different rates) compared to
ummer, and isotope niche metrics are narrower consistent with the growth hypothesis. Mortality in
his group is high suggesting high stress (is food also limiting?), yet comparatively the niche metrics
are much narrower than in the summer, thus inconsistent with the stress hypothesis. For example,
comparing Figure 2 A and B, the range in A is similar to the range of the high quality food range in B.
n Table 4, the seasonal differences are considerably larger than the treatment effects. Set in this
arger context, the stress hypothesis seems weaker than the growth hypothesis. I recognize that the
wo experiments are discussed separately in the manuscript because they are not directly
comparable, and that I am extrapolating for the purpose of discussion, but this comes back to an
ssue you address in the intro: assumptions that make isotope methods useful are rarely tested and
when they are, the results are discussed in the context of a single experiment and not in a larger
ecological context. To be truly effective tools in ecology (e.g. line 67) we need evidence that the
variation observed in any given context is linked to some underlying process. Bringing in some of the
natural history knowledge and Figure S1 to the manuscript may help broaden the utility of these
experimental results.
Reply 4: First a small correction which will make everything less confusing: the mortality is indeed
higher in summer than in winter (I made a mistake in the old response letter in reply 14; I was
hinking survival when I wrote “lower” ) so it is the other way around and not inconsistent with the
tress hypothesis. Also, these amphipods live below the thermocline which means it is 4-5 degrees all
year round (see reply 10). However, we agree that we could help the reader to broaden the
applicability of the results by comparing the two experiments, see lines 506-514 and 462-465 in
discussion where we have expanded on the natural history of the amphipods and how to interpret
ield data given the new knowledge presented in this manuscript. See reply 3 for the suggestions on
ig S1.
Supplementary fig. 1:
diatoms appear to be ~4 per mil different than sediment in this plot but ~7per mil different in the
ipid correction plots in the response to reviews. Similarly the lignin d13C signature in the biplot was
~9per mil depleted relative to sediment but only ~4 per mil in Fig. S1C. Can you reconcile this
difference?
Reply 5: No, it’s the other way around - the left panel (fig 2 in reply 9 in the old response letter)
hows fat/lipid-corrected values and the difference is 4 permille. The right panel shows non-
corrected (fat/lipid) values and here the difference is 7 permille.
The lignin difference is a mistake. It was an excel-typo when making the horizontal line in figure S1 (I
used -26.8 instead of the correct -28.6, it only affects the horizontal line, all other data points in this
igure and in the manuscript and used in statistics are correct). Hence, the horizontal line should be
hifted down 2 units, thanks for pointing it out, and figure S1 is now revised to address this. Again, it
does not change the decreasing trend or any conclusions.
as amphipods grow in the diatom and tetraphyll treatments, the absolute change in d13C decreases,
yet these treatments are more enriched than the initial and reference animals and diets in the biplot
provided in the response to reviews. What are the start and end values of the absolute change in
d13C? How do they decreased from start to finish but become enriched overall?
Reply 6: The absolute change is calculated as amphipod end values – amphipod start value (mean
value). The amphipod values are fat-corrected (Post et al 2007, reasons for this explained on lines
201-202 in the manuscript) whereas the sediment and food sources are not fat corrected (i.e. the
horizontal lines and arrows in fig S1). The fact that amphipods but not food sources are fat-corrected
makes the figure somewhat difficult to interpret at a first read and in the revised figure legend we
have now clarified that (only) amphipod values are fat-corrected. Therefore amphipod start values
are not equal to the sediment value at 0. The figure shows that fast-growing amphipods have the
argest shifts in isotope values (in contrast to the statement above “as amphipods grow in the
diatom and tetraphyll treatments, the absolute change in d13C decreases” which is wrong); the
arger the increase in biomass the larger the (negative) shift from initial values. Even though this
negative trend is statistically significant, it is only in the tetraphyll treatment where amphipods are
within reach of isotopic equilibrium with the new food source. Amphipods fed diatoms had a similar
rend although they did not reach isotopic equilibrium with the new diet within the timeframe of the
experiment. Again (see reply 3), the reason for making this figure was to illustrate that amphipods
were mostly growing (data on growth can be found in Table 1 and S1), also in the low food quality
reatment (reference and lignin), which nuances the interpretation behind slow growth vs starvation
or 13C dynamics in amphipods. See reply 7 for the explanations behind enrichment.
in the biplots provided in the response to reviews, none of the animals fall within the resource
riangle produced by the diets, suggesting they are eating something else (by traditional diet
attribution techniques). You would need a ~3permil d13C diet fractionation factor to fit the tetraphyll
reatment in the lipid corrected and a ~8permil fractionation factor for diatoms. Is this relevant to
he overall diet assumption? I’m still confused about how diatom-fed amphipods are enriched
elative to initials when the diet is so much more depleted.
Reply 7: Since the animals did not grow fast enough to reach isotopic equilibrium within the duration
of the experiment in the diatom treatment we cannot discuss fractionation in this treatment
borderline acceptable to discuss fractionation in the tetraphyll treatment, see reply 6). For isotopic
equilibrium to be reached, the experiment would have required time sequenced sampling of both
consumers and the food sources. Although non-dietary factors such as oxygen content and mortality
of amphipods also influences the d13C values (through respiration-mediated effects as shown in
Table 5) we agree that it is counter-intuitive that amphipods fed high quality food (diatoms and
etraphyll) become more enriched than their start values when the added diatoms had a more
depleted signal. However, this simply demonstrates the challenge of assessing diet of deposit-
eeders, especially when using a field collected mixed diatom species-bloom sample (Karlson et al.
2015). Most likely the isotope signal of the labile organic matter (both diatoms and tetraphyll)
changed due to microbial conditioning throughout the 5-week experiment (the isotope signal given
or food is before adding it to sediment). Goedkoop et al. (2006) showed that tetraphyll isotope
composition became enriched with several permille during a relatively short incubation with
ediment. There are also multiple potential food resources in the sediment, which cannot easily be
extracted and analysed for stable isotopes, e.g. bacteria (Goedkoop and Johnson 1994), fungi, aged
organic matter (Byrén et al. 2006) and such biofilms could have a distinct isotope signal better
eflecting the true diet of consumers. Altogether, this supports our approach of using anomalies to
ocus on relative changes during the experiment and not absolute changes (inserted sentence on
ine 294 ) and stress the need for complementing isotope analyses with non-isotopic methods, such
as molecular diet analyses (see inserted section on lines 531-535).
Specific comments:
ntro: I think more discussion of the niche metrics in the intro would be helpful. Specifically, how do
your hypothesized results influence each metric, and why is ED used as an explanatory variable in the
experiments but not the other layman metrics.
Reply 8: In the revised version we have clarified that we expect all Layman metrics to increase
under stress (see lines 90-92). We had no specific hypothesis about which of the Layman metrics
would increase the most.
ED is used as an explanatory variable because it can be measured on the individual level (now
better explained in methods on line 209-211). The average of all individual ED is the Layman CD –
average distance to centroid (explained on lines 216). Hence, CD and the other Layman metrics each
epresent an overall value for the whole population (treatment) and can therefore not be used as a
predictor in statistical analyses where the response variable is on the individual level.
Line 84: I recommend summarizing the 3 hypotheses in this paragraph for clarity.
Reply 9: Good suggestion, this is now done (see lines 89-92).
Line 147: was experiment 2 run at the same temperature?
Reply 10: Yes, the in situ temperature at these depths are always 4-5 degrees. This is now clarified on
ines 151-152.
Line 328: body mass did not change during the experiment in reference or contaminant treatment,
yet body mass was lower in contaminant at the end of experiment. Does this mean they were
different at the start?
Reply 11: There was no significant difference between initials (start animals) from both treatments,
ee Table 2. The body mass difference at the end of the experiment can be explained by the
difference in the number of embryos (fecundity) which was lower in the contaminant-exposed
amphipods nearly 2 months later. This is because weight (wet weight) was measured for females
ncluding the brood (before embryo analyses). This is explained on line 130.
ine 373 and 424: does this mean that amphipods in the wild are physiologically stressed?
Alternatively, the high quality diet induced the shift in niche metrics?
Reply 12: The amphipods could likely be physiologically stressed in the wild, at least during certain
imes of the year (deposit-feeders are generally food limited at these depths). Here the latter
explanation is probably the most relevant. When offered high quality food, amphipods start feeding
on it. This is expanded on lines 462-465 in the revised discussion.
Line 404: in light of the seasonal differences mentioned in the general comments, discussion could
address relative effects of contaminants/parasites vs growth
Reply 13: Good suggestions, this is now brought up in the revised discussion (lines 532-535 and 542-
545).
Line 408-411: Here is the logical gap. Traditionally these results would be interpreted as variability in
diet (supported by Fig 2B). These results challenge this idea, but then turn around and suggest a new
use for isotopes without closure on the tested assumption. how do we interpret variation as a
esponse to stress from a wild population that may have variability in developmental stage,
growth rate, diet, stress exposure?
Reply 14: Later on in the discussion the use of subcellular biomarkers, specific to certain stressors
were suggested to help disentangling diet stress from contaminant stress. In the revised version we
have added that the best approach would be to also pair e.g. DNA barcoding techniques in stomach
content from individuals with isotope data (Gorokhova and Lehtiniemi 2007). Using such a combined
approach (isotopes, biomarkers and molecular diet analyses) would enable us to disentangle diet
tress from environmental stress (new sentences and references added on lines 531-535,
biomarkers of stress are mentioned on line 521 and onwards).
Line 454-475: paragraph could be consolidated to focus on isotope effects
Reply 15: The paragraph is restructured and improved. Some sentences were moved to methods
lines 246-248) and results (336-338).
Line 476: this is the best evidence of the stress hypothesis. How does the stressed population
compare to reference populations in spring and summer?
Reply 16: The comparison between the two experiments is added and addressed on lines 509-514.
