Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript. Wooller et al. present an important
paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic lake sediment record (Lake Hill) spanning the last ~18,000
years from an island in what would have been part of the Bering Land Bridge during marine
regressions. They focus on the implications of this record for the biogeographic histories of
people—namely in the context of the colonization of the Americas—and megafauna. This is a
wonderful record from a part of the world that is critical for understanding human dispersals,
but for which we lack any terrestrial archives. I think this needs to be published, though I do have
a few (manageable) concerns that warrant attention first.
The important ones:
Results: The results section provides a very detailed summary of changes within the Pleistocene
portion of the sequence, but ends rather abruptly at the onset of the Holocene. From Figure 2, it is
clear that there are plenty of interesting things going on in the Holocene and (in my opinion) they
warrant a bit of discussion. No sense in presenting the entire record if you aren’t going to deal
with it! How do you interpret these Holocene changes? How do they relate to other records? If
space constraints are an issue then put it in the supplement.
As noted in the abstract and the introduction, one of the main aims of this paper is to provide a
better understanding of megafaunal biogeography. There is no doubt that the environmental
changes documented in the Lake Hill record would have been important to terrestrial faunas.
However, I feel that the megafauna biogeographic component is not particularly well-developed
and does not rely much on empirical data, especially in comparison to what is presented on
human biogeography. For example, the human biogeography section of the discussion begins
with 2 paragraphs outlining genetic, archaeological, and other lines of evidence pertaining to
human dispersal across Beringia, which then sets the stage for subsequent discussion (a few more
paragraphs) of how the Lake Hill record can be used to establish relationships between human
biogeography and environment. Note also that archaeological data are integrated into Figure 2.
In contrast, the megafauna biogeography discussion primarily concerns a very short bit of
speculation about how mesic conditions along the land bridge may have served as a dispersal
barrier and/or promoted dispersal into eastern Beringia, and a sentence or two about “faunal
expansion into eastern Beringia” in a very broad sense.
It would be really nice for the authors to draw more heavily from the existing biogeographic
evidence (e.g., fossil remains, their ages, genetic data) pertaining to the history of large mammals
in the region when framing their discussion of this issue. It might be possible to integrate some of
this into Figure 2 (though I don’t wish to imply that merely adding a panel to this Figure is all
that is needed to resolve this issue).
Minor issues:
Line 52: “a key entry point”? How about THE key entry point?
Line 64: cut the “and” from ‘BLB and since the LGM”
Line 97: diatoms were prepared following a “modified protocol.” How so? Note: I see now this is
clarified in the supplemental file—maybe cite the supplemental material here.
Line 99: Fix the citations here

Figure 2: The yellow and gray shading in Figure 2 is barely distinguishable when printed in
black/white. Not sure how many are still printing articles to read, but I do and it would be nice
to pick a pair of colors that don’t look the same in B/W.
Discussion, Page 5: A lot of the references cited in the paragraph starting with “mtDNA analyses
indicate…” are missing from the reference list (e.g., Bourgeon et al. 2017; Braje et al. 2017; Holen
2017; Adovasio 2013, Dillehay 2017). I haven’t checked everything, but it is worth going over
things to make sure none are missing
Lines 217-220: Clearly I’m missing something here (so please clarify), but I don’t see how early
occupation in Alaska along watercourses where people exploited diverse resources is relevant to
the expansion of people during warmer/wetter phases. This seems to imply that we can’t live
along rivers and exploit diverse resources during colder/drier phases…were the river systems in
question dried up during cooler/drier phases?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The MS presents multi-proxy evidence from Lake Hill on St. Paul Island in the Bering Sea and
aims to investigate the environmental evolution of the Bering Land Bridge (BLB) since the LGM.
The MS presents one of the first terrestrially based reconstructions of temperature and
hydrological changes within the spatial envelope of the BLB, which has remained above sea level
throughout its record. There is a vast range of proxies used including chironomid-inferred
summer T, diatom and cladoceran assemblage data, as well as oxygen isotopes of chitinous
chironomid head capsules. These are all fairly well established techniques in palaeolimnology
and are appropriately applied. The authors explore the link between the environment of the BLB
and late glacial dispersal of humans, and the MS’s main conclusions is to support the hypothesis
that expansion of humans in Alaska occurred during the Bølling-Allerød, which is associated
with the development of warmer/wetter conditions. Based on this, the MS explores the affect of
push and pull factors in terms of determining of human migration. However, as stated in the
abstract the paper purports to present unequivocal evidence for widespread human dispersals in
to eastern Beringia during the B-A interstadial. Yet, the link between the archaeology and the
4
presented palaeoclimate record is not made clearly or succinctly enough. For instance, based
solely on Figure 2 one could argue that the archaeological data (b in Fig. 2) does not appear
anyway near conclusive enough since the there are a minor number of site data for this interval
compared to the later Younger Dryas and early Holocene. While the discussion is comprehensive
in discussing the different evidence for colonization of Alaska, none of this is represented in Fig 2,
which would be useful, and should be addressed. Overall the MS is well written and data
presented support the conclusions in terms of palaeoenvironment, and authors are careful not to
overstate their case and explore some interesting links between humans and environment. That
said there are a few considerations the authors need to address before the MS is acceptable for
publication.
Major considerations
Methods, results and interpretations
I am not sure of the word limitations within the main MS text (I couldn’t find anything explicit on
the journal’s website), but the methods written in the main text are very truncated and these have
to be cross-referenced with the supplementary material where there is wealth of information. I
think there also needs to be more information about the methods used within the main body of
the MS. Additionally, some of the discussion about the results that are in the supplementary
information is completely missing and I think some of the discussion presented in the main MS
would benefit from adding some of this information. I think this would aid some of the
palaeonvironmental interpretations rather than how they are currently presented, which is to
assume quite a bit of knowledge (or having read supplementary material already) and the
authors could be a lot more clearer about which proxies are driving their interpretations e.g. line
122 you state the HS1 is cold and dry but you don’t state what this is based on.
Archaeology
There is a very detailed discussion or at the very least round up/review of the literature for
human dispersal since the LGM. While this is thorough and perhaps a bit overly long, for me it
detracts from the main purpose of the discussion, which is linking your palaeoenvironmental
data with the evidence of human dispersal. Perhaps some of the key points about what we know
about the archaeological evidence could come as part of the background/introduction since this
isn’t necessarily the author’s original work, although I know that they have done some work in
creating cumulative evidence for the archaeology. A result of the way the initial discussion is
written is that it appears very lop-sided with far more space devoted to the archaeology, when in
fact there is a lot to discuss in the palaeonvironmental data.
Holocene thermal maximum
This term is used a lot, but is not clearly defined. It would be useful for you to define how you
plan to use it in the MS. In some of the descriptions (in supplementary material for example) the
ages of 11.7-7 ka are used, but then in discussion you refer to Kaufman et al., 2016 who have
pushed it younger than that. So just for clarity, make sure there is consistent use of definition.
Minor considerations
Abstract
L34: I would expand justification of why understanding this is important
L37-38: You don’t mention what evidence you have for human dispersal in the abstract.
Background
L47: I would broaden the context about sea level and ‘other major environmental changes’ – be a
5
little bit more specific about what you mean.
L51: Change “two continents throughout the Pleistocene due to…” to “two continents throughout
the Pleistocene as a result of…”
L57: How accurate is it to say, “split off”, should it be radiated?
L63-64: One of these is a spatial reference while the other is a temporal one, so mixe up your
scales here.
Results
L107-119: Be specific here and map the proxies on to what is telling us these changes in
palaeoenvironment. So needs expansion.
L125-126: But you say this period is 14 – 14.6 ka in the text above.
L129: Why would the water be just driven by diminished evaporative losses rather than increased
in precipitation?
L131: I would be wary of this, as these diatom species will also be sensitive to nutrients.
L150-151: Is there any evidence for the deflation of sediments?
L198-202: Do you have any references for these technological connections?
Discussion
L210: 58th parallel is an Americanism so I would avoid using it because I’m not sure everybody
may know what you mean by this.
L234-257: This section is a bit arm-wavy and the arguments could be tightened up, for example,
you state the “progressively warmer and wetter conditions during the BA could have greatly
transformed much of the southern BLB landscape in to wetlands and peatlands, exacerbating the
effects of the mesic barrier, reducing suitable local habitats for large grazers (bison, horse,
mammoth) and promoting their dispersal into eastern Beringia. These moist environments would
also have limited human ability to travel across the relatively low-lying landscape on the BLB and
prompted humans to seek easier and better-drained terrains in interior Alaska”. This statement is
a very subjective view of the role of large grazers and the impact on human dispersal, so really
needs to be fleshed out a bit.
L269: Define HTM in this context – if I remember rightly Kaufman et al., 2016 define the HTM as
7-5 ka.
Figure 2
You have discussed the chironomid-inferred temperature changes in the text, but one thing that
isn’t discussed is the lack of temperature increase during the HTM. The inferred temperatures
appear lower during the HTM compared to the later Holocene, why is this? There is no real
explanation/discussion of this in the MS. Is it linked to the training set? Representability of the
chironomids in the core? Community changes or some other driver? You state that Chironomus
is abruptly extirpated, which is linked to competition, so how much of the record is temperature
vs. ecosystem dynamics?
You state in the supplementary material that the HTM temperatures are ~10C and “generally the
highest throughout the complete record”, but that is not what Fig. 2 shows. So this needs to be
cleared up.
Also during the HTM it is clear, based on the proxies that it was a much deeper lake, but also
were there any biogeochemical changes that could influence diatoms. Alnus expansion?

ppendix A
ar Dr. Bethan Davies (Associate Editor) and Jon Blundy (Subject Editor)
yal Society Open Science,
nk you for administering the review of our manuscript titled: A new record of Bering Land
dge paleoecology since the Last Glacial Maximum with biogeographic implications
nuscript ID RSOS-180145) submitted to PR Open Science. We appreciate your time and
rt organizing the review of our manuscript. We were pleased that both reviewers recognized
wealth of original data we have generated to shed light on a region that is underrepresented
erms of paleoenvironmental reconstructions.
Since our original submission new and exciting findings have emerged from
heological specimens in interior Alaska, which were very recently reported in Nature
reno-Mayar et al. 2018) and involved one of our co-authors (archeologist Dr. Ben Potter) as
o-lead. Likewise, our novel contribution provides a geographically unique record of
ironmental changes since 18,500 years ago from a critical area at the south-central margin
he now submerged Bering Land Bridge (BLB). Our empirical data supplies vital
eoecological context for the very latest and high profile findings from “Ancient Beringians”
reno-Mayar et al., 2018). Our paper provides evidence for cold, dry and windy conditions
ing Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1) and the Younger Dryas (YD) on the BLB that bracketed a
00-year period of markedly wet and warm conditions during the Bølling/Allerød interstadial.
ably, we find that this wet and warm period coincides with the earliest archeological
dence found to date in Alaska, which has been determined to be part of a founding human
ulation in North America (Moreno-Mayar et al., 2018). Because almost all of the BLB is now
merged below the ocean our data also provides a rare, terrestrially based record of
ironmental changes in close proximity to the re-establishment of circulation between Pacific
Atlantic Oceans following the end of the last glaciation, which will also provide an important
is to test environmental models for the high-latitudes. Given these exciting new
heological findings we have made the archeological context the focus and need for our
pirical paleoenvironmental data – this included modifying the title of our manuscript. In
ition, another letter to Science from a large group of prominent geneticists, archaeologists,
paleoecologists (Potter et al. 2018) indicate the current uncertainty in timing and routes
en by the earliest Americans.
We have modified the manuscript in accordance with the reviewers’ suggestions
mized and described in detail below). We have also ensured that the appropriate sections
e been included prior to the reference list, as instructed. Because our study has not involved
mans or animal subjects we have not included an Ethics statement. We have included a Data
essibility section as requested. We have declared that we have no competing interests and
e included a statement regarding each of the author contributions.
Thank you again for your time and effort – we look forward to having the opportunity of
research appearing in Royal Society Open Science.
Below are the individual responses to each of the reviewer’s comments.

viewer 1 comment: Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript. Wooller et al.
sent an important paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic lake sediment record (Lake Hill)
nning the last ~18,000 years from an island in what would have been part of the Bering Land
dge during marine regressions. They focus on the implications of this record for the
geographic histories of people—namely in the context of the colonization of the Americas—
megafauna. This is a wonderful record from a part of the world that is critical for
erstanding human dispersals, but for which we lack any terrestrial archives. I think this
ds to be published, though I do have a few (manageable) concerns that warrant attention
.
oller et al response: We are very pleased that Reviewer 1 recognized the importance of
paleoenvironmental record to the dispersal of humans into the Americas and that they
eve it should be published.
viewer 1 comment: Results: The results section provides a very detailed summary of
nges within the Pleistocene portion of the sequence, but ends rather abruptly at the onset of
Holocene. From Figure 2, it is clear that there are plenty of interesting things going on in the
ocene and (in my opinion) they warrant a bit of discussion. No sense in presenting the entire
ord if you aren’t going to deal with it! How do you interpret these Holocene changes? How do
y relate to other records? If space constraints are an issue then put it in the supplement.
oller et al response: Our results are focused around the period when archeological
dence first begins to appear in Alaska, which occurred prior to the Holocene. However, we
ee with Reviewer 1 that our results section did finish a little abruptly with a brief reference to
Holocene at the end of the results section. We have therefore added some details of the
ocene section but have kept it somewhat brief as much of the Holocene section and its
eoecology was discussed in detail in an earlier publication from our group (Graham et al.,
6). That paper focused on the extinction of mammoths on the island and identified an
ortant environmental shift that was related to the demise of a mammoth population on the
nd. We have strengthened our citing of that work and its main findings in the results section.
viewer 1 comment: As noted in the abstract and the introduction, one of the main aims of
paper is to provide a better understanding of megafaunal biogeography. There is no doubt
t the environmental changes documented in the Lake Hill record would have been important
errestrial faunas. However, I feel that the megafauna biogeographic component is not
ticularly well developed and does not rely much on empirical data, especially in comparison
hat is presented on human biogeography. For example, the human biogeography section of
discussion begins with 2 paragraphs outlining genetic, archaeological, and other lines of
dence pertaining to human dispersal across Beringia, which then sets the stage for
sequent discussion (a few more paragraphs) of how the Lake Hill record can be used to
ablish relationships between human biogeography and environment. Note also that
haeological data are integrated into Figure 2. In contrast, the megafauna biogeography
cussion primarily concerns a very short bit of speculation about how mesic conditions along
land bridge may have served as a dispersal barrier and/or promoted dispersal into eastern
ingia, and a sentence or two about “faunal expansion into eastern Beringia” in a very broad
se. It would be really nice for the authors to draw more heavily from the existing
geographic evidence (e.g., fossil remains, their ages, genetic data) pertaining to the history
2
arge mammals in the region when framing their discussion of this issue. It might be possible
ntegrate some of this into Figure 2 (though I don’t wish to imply that merely adding a panel to
Figure is all that is needed to resolve this issue).
oller et al response: We had aimed to focus our paper on providing context for human
persal. We wove the consideration of the megafaunal biogeography in our original MS when
ertained to the human dispersal (i.e. as resources humans would have used). However, we
reciate the reviewer’s suggestion and in addition to adding megafaunal data to figure 2, we
e added some relevant text relating to megafaunal biogeography in the discussion. We have
ably highlighted the biogeography of moose which have been the focus of some
siderable genetic studies aimed at better understanding their biogeography, dispersal and
logeny (we have included a citation on this subject). These changes to our manuscript have
ulted in an additional panel in Figure 2 to display the frequency of moose and horse fossils in
rior Alaska (there are obviously no fossils from the submerged BLB). To support this change
igure 2 we have also added to the supplemental data section to include the corresponding
le of published radiocarbon ages we used and their source. We have also included a brief
ement in SI 1 concerning the inclusion and calibration of these radiocarbon ages from
gafauna.
viewer 1 Minor issues:

oller et al response: We agree and have made the change as recommended. Again, we

oller et al response: Change made as recommended.
viewer 1 comment: Line 97: diatoms were prepared following a “modified protocol.” How
Note: I see now this is clarified in the supplemental file—maybe cite the supplemental
terial here.
oller et al response: Change made as recommended and we have cited the supplemental
ument (SI 1).
viewer 1 comment: Line 99: Fix the citations here
oller et al response: Change made as recommended.
viewer 1 comment: Figure 2: The yellow and gray shading in Figure 2 is barely
inguishable when printed in black/white. Not sure how many are still printing articles to read,
I do and it would be nice to pick a pair of colors that don’t look the same in B/W.
oller et al response: We have changed the shaded backgrounds as suggested with an aim
ncrease contrast. We also find the change in colors is a little more intuitive with blue used
ing wetter periods and yellow during the drier/colder periods.

viewer 1 comment: Discussion, Page 5: A lot of the references cited in the paragraph
rting with “mtDNA analyses indicate…” are missing from the reference list (e.g., Bourgeon et
2017; Braje et al. 2017; Holen 2017; Adovasio 2013, Dillehay 2017). I haven’t checked
rything, but it is worth going over things to make sure none are missing
oller et al response: We have systematically checked all of the citations in the MS and the
rence list and have made any corresponding corrections where needed in the MS. These
rences mentioned are now included in the reference list.
viewer 1 comment: Lines 217-220: Clearly I’m missing something here (so please clarify),
I don’t see how early occupation in Alaska along watercourses where people exploited
erse resources is relevant to the expansion of people during warmer/wetter phases. This
ms to imply that we can’t live along rivers and exploit diverse resources during colder/drier
ses…were the river systems in question dried up during cooler/drier phases?
oller et al response: We have modified this text to clarify. It was the inclusion of wetland
ources in the archeological record that we wanted to emphasize rather than their geographic
ing. Changed to: “Allowing humans associated with the earliest unequivocal occupations in
ska (~14,200-13,100 years ago) to exploit a wide range of resources, including wetland
cies (waterfowl, fish) and possibly salmon (with direct evidence of exploitation after 11,800
rs ago), as well as large ungulates (bison, wapiti) (Yesner 2001, Potter et al. 2013, Choy et
2016)”.

viewer 2 comment: The MS presents multi-proxy evidence from Lake Hill on St. Paul Island
he Bering Sea and aims to investigate the environmental evolution of the Bering Land Bridge
B) since the LGM. The MS presents one of the first terrestrially based reconstructions of
perature and hydrological changes within the spatial envelope of the BLB, which has
ained above sea level throughout its record. There is a vast range of proxies used including
onomid-inferred summer T, diatom and cladoceran assemblage data, as well as oxygen
opes of chitinous chironomid head capsules. These are all fairly well established techniques
alaeolimnology and are appropriately applied. The authors explore the link between the
ironment of the BLB and late glacial dispersal of humans, and the MS’s main conclusions is
upport the hypothesis that expansion of humans in Alaska occurred during the Bølling-
rød, which is associated with the development of warmer/wetter conditions. Based on this,
MS explores the affect of push and pull factors in terms of determining of human migration.
oller et al response: We thank Dr. Henderson for his review of our MS and are pleased that
has recognized the vast range of proxies we have applied to reconstruct the past
ironmental conditions on the Bering Land Bridge.
viewer 2 comment: However, as stated in the abstract the paper purports to present
quivocal evidence for widespread human dispersals in to eastern Beringia during the B-A
rstadial. Yet, the link between the archaeology and the presented palaeoclimate record is
made clearly or succinctly enough. For instance, based solely on Figure 2 one could argue
t the archaeological data (b in Fig. 2) does not appear anyway near conclusive enough since
there are a minor number of site data for this interval compared to the later Younger Dryas
early Holocene.

oller et al response: Some of these comments contrast with those of Reviewer 1, who
sidered the archeological aspects of the paper to be well represented. We have added some
ification regarding the timing of the archeological record in the discussion. Our needing to
the term “unequivocal” was to distinguish the sites and archeology we have included from
e other sites in Eastern Beringia that remain (at the moment) debated and very contentious
ich we draw attention to in our introduction). The important point of the archeological record,
presented in Figure 2, is not the frequency of the earliest sites but the very appearance of the
liest sites in eastern Beringia – a first appearance that is strongly associated with the wet
ditions of the BA and represents the first establishment of a new people (Ancient Beringians)
orth America (Moreno-Mayar et al., 2018). We have, however, removed the term
espread’ from that sentence in the abstract.
viewer 2 comment: While the discussion is comprehensive in discussing the different
dence for colonization of Alaska, none of this is represented in Fig 2, which would be useful,
should be addressed.
oller et al response: Our figure 2 (b) only includes physical archeological evidence, which
ssociated with firm chronological constraints that allow correlation with our record from the
B. Some of the other lines of evidence, including the estimates from the ancient DNA, are
ociated with much broader estimates of timing (e.g. Llamas et al. 2016) and would be
cult and inappropriate to graphically represent as a correlation with our record, although we
e included mention of the evidence in our introduction and discussion.
viewer 2 comment: Overall the MS is well written and data presented support the
clusions in terms of palaeoenvironment, and authors are careful not to overstate their case
explore some interesting links between humans and environment. That said there are a few
siderations the authors need to address before the MS is acceptable for publication.
oller et al response: We are glad that Dr. Henderson finds our MS to be well written and
t the data supports our conclusions.
jor considerations
viewer 2 comment: Methods, results and interpretations I am not sure of the word limitations
hin the main MS text (I couldn’t find anything explicit on the journal’s website), but the
thods written in the main text are very truncated and these have to be cross-referenced with
supplementary material where there is wealth of information. I think there also needs to be
re information about the methods used within the main body of the MS. Additionally, some of
discussion about the results that are in the supplementary information is completely missing
I think some of the discussion presented in the main MS would benefit from adding some of
information. I think this would aid some of the palaeonvironmental interpretations rather
n how they are currently presented, which is to assume quite a bit of knowledge (or having
d supplementary material already) and the authors could be a lot more clearer about which
xies are driving their interpretations e.g. line 122 you state the HS1 is cold and dry but you
’t state what this is based on.
oller et al response: We have added some of the main details pertaining to the methods
m the supplemental documents. Adding a lot of the results would make the manuscript far too
g as we incorporate data from many proxies and we have opted to retain much of the results
terials in the supplemental document, favoring to cite the supplemental materials when
porting evidence for a point is needed. However, we have added details in the results text to
5
r to which particular proxies are supporting the elements of the paleoenvironmental
onstruction. We also added to the results section some existing paleoenvironmental data that
ports these interpretations.
viewer 2 comment: Archaeology: There is a very detailed discussion or at the very least
nd up/review of the literature for human dispersal since the LGM. While this is thorough and
haps a bit overly long, for me it detracts from the main purpose of the discussion, which is
ing your palaeoenvironmental data with the evidence of human dispersal. Perhaps some of
key points about what we know about the archaeological evidence could come as part of the
kground/introduction since this isn’t necessarily the author’s original work, although I know
t they have done some work in creating cumulative evidence for the archaeology. A result of
way the initial discussion is written is that it appears very lop-sided with far more space
oted to the archaeology, when in fact there is a lot to discuss in the palaeonvironmental
a.
oller et al response: We acknowledge that our paper does include details regarding the
heology. This includes a detailed account in the introduction and details in the discussion
arding the timing of Ancient Beringian dispersal. Inclusion of this level of detail was a
scious decision on our part and is needed given the highly contentious nature of the debates
cerning the archeology of eastern Beringia and subsequent human dispersal into the
ericas. For example, since our submission the lead archeologist co-author on our paper has
to lead a response in Science to hypotheses concerning the dispersal of humans out of
tern Beringia (Potter et al. 2018 – included now in our revised version). We also find the
ails concerning the archeological context are important to include in the discussion to
phasize the importance and uniqueness of our paleoenvironmental record. A comprehensive
usion of pertinent archeological evidence and context is needed if the value of our data is to
seen in the light of contributing to reconstructing the paleoenvironment of human dispersal.
have added some extra text in the discussion regarding the paleoenvironmental
onstruction but have opted to keep much of the details concerning the interpretation of our
a in the supplemental document to save space.
viewer 2 comment: Holocene thermal maximum. This term is used a lot, but is not clearly
ined. It would be useful for you to define how you plan to use it in the MS. In some of the
criptions (in supplementary material for example) the ages of 11.7-7 ka are used, but then in
cussion you refer to Kaufman et al., 2016 who have pushed it younger than that. So just for
ity, make sure there is consistent use of definition.
oller et al response: We agree with Reviewer 2 here. We reviewed Kaufman’s papers
in on the subject of the HTM and have decided to remove reference to the original HTM that
uffman had proposed in one of his earlier papers. The HTM is indeed a little unclear for
tern Beringia based on his 2016 paper. We have altered Figure 2 and any of the SI figures
t included reference to the HTM. We have decided instead to retain some of the language
terminology used in Kaufman 2016, which includes reference to the early Holocene and a
dle Holocene Thermal Maximum, which correlates with a period of lowered lake levels in our
ord. We have removed reference to the HTM from the rest of the MS as we see no need in
paper to enter into a debate on the nature and or existence of a HTM in Beringia.

oller et al response: Changed text to reflect the 14 – 14.6 period.
viewer 2 comment: L129: Why would the water be just driven by diminished evaporative
ses rather than increased in precipitation?
oller et al response: The modern d18O values of Lake Hill that we present in the
plemental data section, alongside the modern precipitation and modeled d18O values for St
7
ul Island, indicate that the lake’s d18O values are significantly influenced by evaporation.
s is consistent with the relatively low amounts of precipitation and the site’s exposure to

viewer 2 comment: L131: I would be wary of this, as these diatom species will also be
sitive to nutrients.
oller et al response: We have modified the text to acknowledge the potential role in the
nge in nutrients. However, the diatom data that implies an increased lake level does
relate with our other proxy data that indicate a greater availability of moisture.
viewer 2 comment: L150-151: Is there any evidence for the deflation of sediments?
oller et al response: With our radiocarbon dates bracketing either side of the YD, the
imentation rate does not indicate any loss due to deflation. Moreover, the sediment retains a
ular layering that does not indicate a major disturbance in the sediment.

oller et al response: We have changed the text here to be more universal.

tened up, for example, you state the “progressively warmer and wetter conditions during the
could have greatly transformed much of the southern BLB landscape in to wetlands and
tlands, exacerbating the effects of the mesic barrier, reducing suitable local habitats for large
zers (bison, horse, mammoth) and promoting their dispersal into eastern Beringia. These
ist environments would also have limited human ability to travel across the relatively low-
g landscape on the BLB and prompted humans to seek easier and better-drained terrains in
rior Alaska”. This statement is a very subjective view of the role of large grazers and the
act on human dispersal, so really needs to be fleshed out a bit.
oller et al response: We have modified the text in this section and have also included
rence to specific citations that have also proposed similar scenarios.

viewer 2 comment: Figure 2You have discussed the chironomid-inferred temperature
nges in the text, but one thing that isn’t discussed is the lack of temperature increase during
HTM. The inferred temperatures appear lower during the HTM compared to the later
ocene, why is this? There is no real explanation/discussion of this in the MS. Is it linked to
training set? Representability of the chironomids in the core? Community changes or some
er driver? You state that Chironomus is abruptly extirpated, which is linked to competition, so
much of the record is temperature vs. ecosystem dynamics?
oller et al response: We have now removed reference to the HTM (see comment above).
re also seems to a wide range of potential paleoenvironmental scenarios for this period, at
st in eastern Beringia (Kaufman et al. 2016). This emphasizes the importance of our
tribution. The pattern we have documented is not the result of representability of the
onomids in the core and have demonstrated the strength of our temperature reconstruction
ur supplemental materials. We have included, as co-authors, input from five experts in
onomids and their use in temperature reconstructions. This was necessary to insure an
ropriate interpretation. We stand by our temperature reconstruction.

ease in nitrogen fixation.
