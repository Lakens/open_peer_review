The paper presents Koiter's version of shell theory in a nice geometric language. The paper does
not appear to contain fundamentally new results but the geometric language is interesting and
useful in itself. The authors are right in stating that many previous publications in the subject
area had serious issues related to the choice of particular coordinate systems. Providing a clear
and elegant coordinate-free representation of Koiter's shell theory benefits the subject.
The authors state that their approach is based on David Hestenes' Geometric Algebra. I found
little evidence of Geometric Algebra in the paper. My impression is that the authors simply make
good use of frames and coframes, an approach which is relatively well established in theoretical
physics.
The paper is well written and exceptionally clear. It is good that most technical calculations have
been moved to appendices.
I must admit that I haven't been following the subject of shell theory in recent years so it is hard
for me to say to what extent the geometric language proposed by the authors is new. I know that
some authors have been trying to present shell theory in a more coherent geometric fashion. Still,
my feeling is that the approach proposed in the paper under review is new. I haven't seen shell
theory being consistently formulated in the language of frames/coframes.

The paper addresses the derivation of an elastic shell theory making a lot of claims about the
literature and the contributions. There is a fundamental problem with the fact that there is a wide
literature (see the book by S. Antman, Nonlinear problems of elasticity, Springer, 2005, 2nd Ed.)
addressing different geometrically exact theories of shells without using component
form formulations but vector-based coordinate-independent settings.
It seems that the authors should spend considerable time reviewing the literature before deciding
which twist they would like to give to their work.
It cannot be accepted in the present form.

The authors have explained better the literature context. However, besides the bivectors, I still do
not see
1. fundamental novelty
2. direct or indirect proof of the correctness of the formulation through use of conservation laws,
functional analysis, numerical simulations.
I personally agree with the claims of the authors about GA although I do not see a sufficient
strength of the present contribution to deserve publication in PRS. I have granted the editor the
full liberty to make his own decision without expressing a view that may seem to be too radical.
By and large, the content is fine but the strength has to be put in the context of the PRS high
standards.

Dear Mr Gregory:
It is a pleasure to accept your manuscript entitled "The Elastic Theory of Shells using Geometric
Algebra" in its current form for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
You can expect to receive a proof of your article in the near future. Please contact the editorial
office (openscience_proofs@royalsociety.org and openscience@royalsociety.org) to let us know if
you are likely to be away from e-mail contact. Due to rapid publication and an extremely tight

The first, third, and fourth paragraphs of this review do not require a response.
The majority of the paper does make use of frames and coframes, how- ever, torques and angular
velocities are treated as bivectors, and this treat- ment, and the techniques associated with it, has its
roots in GA (see [1,
§3]). We also feel that GA provides a particularly simple way of dealing with frames and coframes, for
example, providing explicit expressions for the coframe in terms of the frame without the need to invert
a matrix, and that these techniques were used when performing the work from which the paper
emerged.
The use of material specific to GA is limited, however, it is our hope that with the basic theory in place it
may be possible to make use of rotors in a similar way to [2], which would take advantage of GA more
explicitly.
We have edited the introduction to make the use of GA clearer, and have expanded the conclusion to
make clearer the possible areas of further work.
*****Reviewer 3*****
The paper addresses the derivation of an elastic shell theory making a lot of claims about the literature
and the contribu- tions. There is a fundamental problem with the fact that there is a wide literature (see
the book by S. Antman, Nonlinear prob- lems of elasticity, Springer, 2005, 2nd Ed.) addressing different
geometrically exact theories of shells without using component form formulations but vector-based
coordinate-independent set- tings.
It seems that the authors should spend considerable time review- ing the literature before deciding
which twist they would like to give to their work. It cannot be accepted in the present form.
In our own work we needed an accessible theory that allowed us to look at small deformations (not
necessarily axisymmetric) of a shell about a de- formed state. It is true that there is a wide literature on
shell theory, but we found that a theory with the required brevity, clarity, and explicit results for
linearisation about a deformed state was lacking. For this reason we derived our own, making use of [3]
and [4], which form the basis for [5] and others, such as [6], who restrict their attention to plates as
opposed to shells.
Antman does provide a geometrically exact shell theory, however, he himself cites [4] as a fundamental
reference for shell theory [5, p.708]. We feel that Antmans theory suffers the same problems as [3].
The theory is placed in the final chapter of his book, and this chapter does rely on previous chapters, in
particular for constitutive theory, meaning that it is far from lucid and does not stand alone. This final
chapter also lacks explicit results for linearisation about a deformed state. While the theory is correct, it
is not accessible. We found that the only way to understand this theory was to re-derive it from first
principles, and this took a considerable effort. We felt that it was possible for us to create a shell theory
with improved brevity and clarity, and that provided explicit results for linearisation about a deformed
state. Having done this for our own purposes, we felt that it was worth writing this down in as compact
and lucid a form as possible, and sharing it with the community. We also note that our shell theory uses
a two- dimensional surface as its starting point, while [5] derives his shell theory from 3-dimensional
elasticity. The difference (and ultimate equivalence) between these approaches is discussed at length by
[3] but we feel that our approach allows quicker access to a useful mathematical framework. We also
feel that the novel use of bivectors to represent angular velocities and torques aids understanding of
how angular momentum is used in shell theory.
We have edited the introduction with further references to better explain our purpose, and our
contribution.
