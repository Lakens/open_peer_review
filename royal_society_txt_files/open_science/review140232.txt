This is a clearly written manuscript that uses simulation to deal with a single, circumscribed
issue: the convenient generation of data suitable for network and other analyses. Its main result is
that the collection of neighbour clusters in the field allows the more rapid generation (or
generation using sparser data) of group cluster matrices.
I have two general queries. The first is how matrix construction will cope with incomplete or
ambiguous data? While neighbour clusters are very easy to see in Figure 1, it is rare that all
animals will be visible during scans, especially from large, dispersed groups where, even if they
can all be seen, identifying cluster membership may be difficult. I suspect that there will be no
real problem as the derivation of network measures from ordinary nearest neighbour information
is eminently possible. Noise in the data, though may reduce the relative advantage of the
proposed method. This leads to my second query, which concerns the use of a 'chain method' by
Aureli et al (2012) to determine clusters using only nearest neighbour information. thereby
allowing a post-hoc determination of membership at any moment. Given this, can the author
provide a defence of the utility of his approach?
Minor points:
38, 103: Either moment or time, not both.
103: 'identities' are known (not 'is').

General comments:
This paper proposes a new clustering method as an improvement of the nearest neighbor
distance method to account for possible second, third or higher order relationship among
3
animals. When using the nearest neighbor distance method, we are able to confirm the
occurrence of all the strong dyadic relationships between individuals but we lose (as the author
pointed out) all the other possible interesting relationships.
Although I am convinced about the general validity of the method proposed as a better
representation of the social world an animal can experience comparing to the usual dyadic
nearest neighbor distance, I have the feeling that an important bias can occur using this cluster
method.
In particular, the nearest neighbor distance comes with the possible error of loosing important
relationship occurring in the group but the cluster method introduced here can give a larger
weight to relationship that are not directly observable. I have the feeling that a choice has to be
done before choosing one of these two methods: loosing information about second, third or
higher order social relationship (count method) or increasing the chance to give importance to
relationships that don't exist. An example comes from the same figure the author proposed in the
paper (Figure 1). For a better comprehension, imaging that the individual positions represented
in this figure were the real X Y coordinates of the animals. Let's use the individual A, C and F.
From the cluster method, C and F have higher cluster values distance than A and C. Anyway, if
we have a closer look at the 12 observations proposed in Figure 1 we can easily see that, although
C and F have higher cluster counts, C and A are closer (based on the euclidean distance) at least
on 11 out of the 12 observations presented. It comes out that the clustering method gives a higher
value to C related to the farther F individual than to the closer A. Obviously this is an example
based on fake positions but the reasoning is still valid when working with real animal positions.
How the author feel about this possible bias?
I think the method proposed here has to be presented with its limitation adding to the MS the
possible estimation bias can derive from using it to open further scientific discussions on the way
to develop a complex and exhaustive method in association analysis studies. Using a cut-off in
the proposed clustering method could be a way to reduce this bias but I also agree with the
author that cut-off distance are usually based on subjective choice.
The author claims in the abstract that this method can generate comparable metrics to the one
calculated from the nearest neighbor distance method using a much less amount of data: what
exactly the enhancement of the method is? Is the author proposing a possible way to save time
and energy during filed work? If yes, is the author able to give clear indication on the amount of
efforts needed to obtain a satisfying dataset? What is the mean number of matrices needed both
for the nearest neighbors count and the cluster method to reach their own plateau? Is it possible
to have an idea of the percentage of time gained (i.e. sample size dimension) using the clustering
method?
Minor comments:
Line 207: I really appreciated the idea of using this index for temporal proximity data where the
space dimension is not included.
Line 152: here the range of the overall difference dn is not complete. If I well understood the
index can go from 0 (identical matrices) to 1 (completely different matrices). Is it correct? If so,
insert the range into the paper.

Dear Author,
I have the feeling that the author takes into account the comments and he tried to include them
into the paper but I am not completely satisfied by the answer given at line 213-214.
The author does not clearly discuss the main issue I have introduced in the first "comments to the
author" (see general comments part) also if he seems to agree at the critique I have brought.
I think this work is a real improvement in nearest neighbours distance studies but, as stated by
the author in his answer, if the issue introduced in my general comments is a "valid point", the
author should better discuss it in the MS.
Sincerely
