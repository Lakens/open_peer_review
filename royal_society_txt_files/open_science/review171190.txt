The authors describe an epoxide opening strategy under continuous flow conditions to access a
broad range of biologically relevant compounds and building-blocks. The spectra in the SI are of
excellent quality and the authors should be commended, the authors do an excellent job of
separating and characterising the individual compounds from mixtures.
The authors describe an epoxide opening strategy under continuous flow conditions to access a
broad range of biologically relevant compounds and building-blocks. The spectra in the SI are of
excellent quality and the authors should be commended, the authors do an excellent job of
separating and characterising the individual compounds from mixtures.
The chemistry is not praticulalry exciting and is broad in focus with essentially 3 strands ‘Herein
we report a flow chemistry approach to epoxide installation using epichlorohydrin and the in-
situ epoxidation of olefins with dimethyl dioxirane and the subsequent epoxide aminolysis’. The
interesting part of generating and using DMDO is diluted by the other 2 strands. From a safety
perspective, it is not discussed how remaining DMDO is quenched. This should be done inline by
the addition of a sacrificial quenching material at the outlet of the reactor. Is the flow process
therefore any safer than a batch process? At scale, I would say not necessarily.
It would be useful to clarify the enantiopurity of epichlorohydrin. Epichlorohydrin in its racemic
form is inexpensive. As enantiomerically pure form it is expensive and worth recycling. The
experimental description does not describe whether it is racemic or enriched. The fact that the
authors are discussing recycling processes implies that this is an enantiomerically pure form. This
leads to a considerations that if all work is conducted on enantiomerically pure materials then
these need to be characterised accordingly (alpha D measurement) and the correct structures
used.

The paper by Cossar et al details the generation of beta-amino alcohols by the aminolysis of in
situ generated epoxides, either by epoxidation or alkylation via epichorohydrin. Overall the
paper is good and should be accepted after minor corrections, A few comments which will add to
the overall clarity and help improve the work are given below in chronological order:
- P2,L1: There are several mentions of the various vapourtec systems used in this work. the
brands of the systems used are irrelevant to the main text - the important thing to note is whether
peristaltic or HPLC pumps are used. the details of the instrument should be moved to the SI,
otherwise it feels too much like an advertisement.
- P2,L2: what concentrations are you working at?
- P2,L6: was ppt observed, or are you simply mentioning a general feature of the kind of pump?
- P2,L9: what are the other byproducts which are formed? is it an issue of regioselectivity as noted
later or is it something else?
- P2,L13: these concentrations don't mean much without knowledge of the SM concentrations. are
these 100fold excesses or 5?
- P2,L15: what was the approximate ratio of the sections of the column?
P2,L29: if you're simply leaching the carbonate into solution, have you looked at passing through
the hot column quickly and then heating the resulting solution?
you ran it for 3 h, but still quite sub-stoichiometrically i assume. is it catalytic or will the column
be consumed more quickly?
P2,L40: what do you mean by semi-automated?
P2,L51: what conditions were they? temperature, residence time, equivalents, etc.?
more info or at least reference that you put this info in the SI
P2,L52: there is no reason that it would work in a microwave and not in flow, they both operate
under the same principle - heating under pressure - with flow having the advantage of no head
space. revise this argument
P2,L56: where is this data provided?
P2,L59: the procedure used by Seeberger was originally developed by Jamison/Jensen (OPRD
2011?) and should be referenced here as well
P3,L16: how much of the respective byproducts were observed? why do you hypothesize it is
more selective?

ition of a sacrificial quenching material …
ponse
are grateful to the reviewer for this suggestion. Based on this we have modified our procedure to include an in-line
nching with 4 M sodium sulphite. This afforded excellent results and the text of the manuscript has been modified to
ct this change. This now reads:
To further improve the safety of this reaction, the optimised reaction was repeated with the addition of a 0.4 M
odium sulphite(aq) stream introduced after the back pressure regulator to quench any unreacted DMDO. Analysis and
ubsequent yield calculation showed no reduction in conversion or isolated yields.
eeping with this change we have updated the experimental section to read:
General Procedure 2: Using a Vapourtec RS-200 equipped with collection valve kit and synthesis auto-sampler, a 10
mL reaction loop was charged with a 0.05 M solution of alkene (1 mmol) in acetone. The solution was pumped at
-1 through PFA tubing and mixed with a stream of 0.315 M sodium hydrogen carbonate
(aq) (6.30
-1. The out-going solution then passed through an 8 cm PFA tube and mixed with a stream
of 0.394 M Oxone(aq) -1). The resulting stream was subsequently passed through two 10
mL PFA coil reactors in series at 60 °C, 5 bar and 1 mL min-1 (residence time 20 min). The resulting reaction
tream was then quenched in-line (immediately after the back pressure regulator) using a stream 0.4 M sodium
ulfite(aq). The solution was then collected, concentrated in vacuo to remove acetone and diluted up to 50 mL with
water (pH 7). The pH of the solution was adjusted to pH ~ 7 using saturated ammonium chloride(aq). The aqueous
olution was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 50 mL), the organic layers were combined and washed with brine (50
mL). The organic layer was separated, dried over magnesium sulphate and concentrated in vacuo to afford the
desired product; no further purification was required unless stated.
ment
uld be useful to clarify the enantiopurity of epichlorohydrin. Epichlorohydrin in its racemic form is inexpensive. As enantiomerically pure form
expensive and worth recycling.
ponse
emic epichlorohydrin was used; whilst moderately inexpensive, the recycling procedure was considered desirable due to
desire to reduce the environmental effects of excess use, as well as demonstrate a potential protocol to recycle the
ificantly more expensive enantiopure epichlorohydrin.
specified that these studies were conducted using the racemic material in the manuscript body which has been modified
ad:
n keeping with an epoxide ring opening strategy, 1 can be accessed via aminopyrimidine 2, racemic
pichlorohydrin 3 and 4-nitrophenol 4, enabling robust focused library development (Figure 1).

ment
1: There are several mentions of the various Vapourtec systems used in this work. The brands of the systems used are irrelevant to the main
- the important thing to note is whether peristaltic or HPLC pumps are used. The details of the instrument should be moved to the SI,
wise it feels too much like an advertisement.
ponse
d not been our intent to advertise one manufacturer over another, but this reviewer is correct and the mention of the
ument manufacturer is not pertinent, but the identification of pump type used is. Accordingly mentions of the
ument supplier has been removed from the main text and the pump type specified where appropriate.
ment
2: What concentrations are you working at?
ponse
concentrations are defined in Scheme 1, however, for further clarity the actual concentrations used have been added to
body of the text. The modifications to the text typically read as:
…passing two reagent streams, epichlorohydrin 3 (neat) and 4-nitrophenol 4 (0.1 M) in DMF, through an
Omnifit® column packed with Cs2CO3 and clean sand (1:1) at 75 ºC, increasing in 10 ºC increments to 105 ºC, with
he reaction monitored by UPLC-MS (Scheme 1; Table 1).
ment
6: was ppt observed, or are you simply mentioning a general feature of the kind of pump?
ponse
a precipitate was observed. This section of the manuscript now reads:
The system pressure was maintained at 5 bar using the third pump in active back pressure regulation mode, to
ircumvent the blockage issues caused by the precipitation of the product we had previously observed.
ment
9: what are the other byproducts which are formed? Is it an issue of regioselectivity as noted later or is it something else?
ponse
have clarified this section of the manuscript to reflect that the issue observed was not one of a change in selectivity or
generation of by-products, but frustratingly one of purification in the presence of N(Bu)4OAc. This section now reads:
With DMF/N(Bu)4OAc, poor product recovery was a function of difficulties observed in isolating the desired product
n the presence of N(Bu)4OAc; thus Cs2CO3 was used for on-going optimizations.
ment
13: these concentrations don't mean much without knowledge of the SM concentrations. Are these 100fold excesses or 5?
ponse
concentration of 4-nitrophenol, and all other materials, used herein has been added for clarity. A typical text change
s as:
Use of 0.1 M of 4-nitrophenol 4 and 5, 2.5 and 0.5 M 3 in DMF gave 66%, 39% and 13% conversion to 5a, respectively.
At 2.5 M of 3, a 20 min residence time saw increased conversion to 5a from 39% to 70%.
ment
15: what was the approximate ratio of the sections of the column?
ponse
approximate ratios of the column have been added, and the text modified to read:
At 115 ºC, unwanted diol 6a was evident, but this was reduced through the use of a 4Å sieves/acid washed
and/Cs2CO3 (2:1:1 v/v/v) loaded Omnifit® column. Quantitative conversion to epoxy ether 5a was noted at 105
C, with 5 M 3 and a 20 min residence time (Scheme 2).
ment
29: if you're simply leaching the carbonate into solution, have you looked at passing through the hot column quickly and then heating the
ting solution? you ran it for 3 h, but still quite sub-stoichiometrically I assume. Is it catalytic or will the column be consumed more quickly?
ponse
e noted no drop of in conversion to the desired product(s) no effort was made to heat the column. Our procedure as
ten ensured retention of the reaction stoichiometry used in the optimisation studies.
ment
40: What do you mean by semi-automated?
ponse
have clarified this section of the manuscript in light of this reviewer’s question to read:
The DMDO flow epoxidation protocol was explored with an auto-sampler and fraction collector equipped flow system
nd provided an effective and robust approach to the semi-automated synthesis and collection of epoxides via aromatic
nd aliphatic olefins (Scheme 3 and Table 4).
ment
51: What conditions were they? Temperature, residence time, equivalents, etc.? more info or at least reference that you put this info in the SI.
ponse
reaction conditions have been added to the manuscript text and this section now reads:
However, under flow conditions, employing 30 mol% Bi(OTf), 120 ºC, 5 bar and a residence time of 20 min, only a
mall amount (17%) of the amino alcohol was detected. As a result we shifted focus to the application of microwave
pproaches (Scheme 4).
ment
52: there is no reason that it would work in a microwave and not in flow, they both operate under the same principle - heating under pressure
h flow having the advantage of no head space. revise this argument.
ponse
largely agree with this comment but note that one of the primary advantages of a flow system (in addition to heating
er pressure) is that the reagents are rapidly removed from the heating zone and this has been attributed as a contributing
or for the changes in selectivity observed relative to conventional and even microwave heating approaches. The reaction
proceed in flow, but requires increased quantities of Bi(OTf)3 which complicates reaction work up. The text has been
ified to read:
However, under flow conditions, employing 30 mol% Bi(OTf)3, 120 ºC, 5 bar and a residence time of 20 min, only a
mall amount (17%) of a Bi-catalysed amino alcohol was detected. Increasing the amount of bismuth catalyst to 50%
ncreased the formation of product to 75%; however, as excess catalyst is undesirable for purification, we shifted focus
o the application of microwave approaches (Scheme 4).44, 47, 48
ment
56: Where is this data provided?
ponse
ddress the reviewers comment the following was added to indicate that the requested data is provided in the
rimental section of this manuscript:
However, limited regiocontrol with other amines of interest was observed under these conditions (for ratio of regioisomers
ee experimental section).
ment
59: the procedure used by Seeberger was originally developed by Jamison/Jensen (OPRD 2011?) and should be referenced here as well.
ponse
have modified our manuscript in light of our oversight to read:
We turned our attention to a recent report from the Seeberger laboratory that reported the model epoxide aminolysis of
tyrene with t-butyl and isopropyl amine by flow,29 as well as a previous publication by Jamison et al.30 While
Seeberger’s work reported the successful synthesis of a number of APIs under catalyst free conditions, the aminolysis
tep was limited to the aforementioned amines and the scope of the reaction was not defined. We endeavoured to
xtend the reach of these approaches.
ment
16: how much of the respective byproducts were observed? why do you hypothesize it is more selective?
ponse
current hypothesis is that the reduction in by-product production is a consequence of the removal of the reaction
ure from the heat source and the enhanced mixing, which is in keeping with prior findings with flow reactions. We
added additional literature precedents in this area to support our belief.
ment
20: but in the first sentence of this paragraph you say that this reaction saw greater than 90% selectivity, did it not work well?
ponse
reaction works well in terms of starting material conversion to product, the issue that was experienced was obtaining the
ted product in the required purity as a consequence of amine contamination. We have clarified this in our revision of this
on of the manuscript:
Aminolysis of epoxide 8a with amines 9a-g furnished 11a-g with =90% regioselectivity for the secondary alcohol, in
principle simplifying purification of the desired regioisomer compared to the microwave methodology. However, the
solated yields of 11a-g ranged from 21 – 79%. LCMS analysis revealed product contamination with residual amine, and that
his was most apparent with aliphatic amines 9a and 9c.
ment
30: if you keep referring back to the microwave protocol then you have to say what the selectivities were for that.
ponse
have added clarification to this section of the manuscript indicating that the selectivities of the reaction can be located in
experimental section through the addition of the following text:
…to improved regioselectivity (see experimental section for regioisomer ratios).
ment
35: i would then add how much you actually made, how long you ran it for. Otherwise you can’t say that you realized multi-gram quantities.
ponse
ccord with this suggestion we have updated the text to read:
This access is scalable with multi-gram quantities of aryloxy epoxides accessible, e.g. 5a (0.49 g.h-1; with our three hour
low synthesis realising 1.48 g of material).
ment
36: again, this was originally developed by Jamison/Jensen and they should get credit, not Seeberger. if you want to reference that it was a 2-
