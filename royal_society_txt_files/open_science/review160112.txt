This manuscript by Das et al. assesses the role of rotameric state of tyrosine sidechain on its
fluorescence in two different conformations of the Abeta peptide. This work is interesting, and
the experimental and molecular dynamics data support the conclusions. My only concern,
although minor, is that the authors fail to stress the importance of their study in a broader
context. In particular,
(1) Does the rotameric state of tyrosine somehow influences the stabilizing interactions in
Abeta peptide, thus preventing or enhancing its aggregation?
(2) There is significant work done on other fluorophores whose fluorescence has been
shown to depend on their rotameric state (Lakowicz et al., Principles of Fluorescence
Spectroscopy). Authors need to discuss their work in this context.

1. Abstract: no information on what kinds of experiments and calculations are reported in
the paper.
2. Introduction: it is in fact a summary of the results, but without clear statement on what
research methods were used. No discussion of the current knowledge on Ab research.
3. Pre-aggregates are known to exist in Ab when purchased from such suppliers. No
consideration of this is made in the article. Hexafluoroisopropanol has been used to minimise this
(e.g. Stine, W.B.; Dahlgren, K.N.; Krafft, G.A.; and LaDu, M.J., In vitro characterization of

conditions for amyloid-beta peptide oligomerization and fibrillogenesis. J.Biol.Chem. 2003.
278(13):11612-22).
4. A-beta (1-42) peptides at the concentration of 20 µM tend to aggregate, so the
fluorescence response evolves in time. The authors consider their samples as stable solutions of
non-interacting monomers, which is unlikely to be true.
5. MD: Simulation time (50 ns) is surprisingly short. Only one trajectory has been
calculated, no MD statistics given. In order to make any conclusions a number of trajectories and
their statistics are needed.
6. MD: Comment on constraining the geometry of water and heavy atom – hydrogen bonds
(p.6 lines 18-25) is confusing: Both PME and PBC do not constrain any bonds.
7. No information on counter ions added. The distances between the peptide and the walls
of the box are not given.
8. Figure 3A shows the spectral shape to be constant as function of methanol concentration.
Is this not somewhat surprising given the exposure to solvent?
9. The MD results should be compared with the data cited by recent papers in this field
(e.g. Amaro, M.; Kubiak-Ossowska, K.; Birch, D.J.S.; Rolinski, O.J., Methods Appl. Fluoresc. 2013,
1, 015006).
10. P.10 lines 50-60: The paper compares the spectroscopic measurements of the samples
with many interacting and aggregating peptides with MD simulations of one isolated peptide
with no proper MD statistics. Therefore the conclusions of this paper are not well justified.

s manuscript by Das et al. assesses the role of rotameric state of tyrosine side chain on its
rescence in two different conformations of the Aß peptide. This work is interesting, and the
erimental and molecular dynamics data support the conclusions. My only concern, although
or, is that the authors fail to stress the importance of their study in a broader context.
articular,
Does the rotameric state of tyrosine somehow influence the stabilizing interactions in
eta peptide, thus preventing or enhancing its aggregation?
. We thank the reviewer for allowing us to answer one of the major concerns of this
nuscript. Tyrosine residue is an intrinsic fluorophore in the Aß peptides and thus has
lications towards the structural information of the peptides. It is well known that upon
ractions within the micellar environment, the protein/peptides undergo changes in the
formational state. We observed that in alpha helical conformation in micellar environment
in disordered state of the peptide in aqueous buffer, the residue remains largely in two
erent rotameric state and showed different degree of fluorescence. It was observed that the
tide with alpha helical structure in micellar environment remains much stable and less prone
orm amyloid aggregates. However, it’s not clear whether rotameric state of the tyrosyl group
any direct effect on this. We added this point in the revised manuscript.
There is significant work done on other fluorophores whose fluorescence has been
wn to depend on their rotameric state (Lakowicz et al., Principles of Fluorescence
ctroscopy). Authors need to discuss their work in this context.
. We discussed this proposition in the revised manuscript. Fluorescence is a molecular
perty and is dependent on the geometry and electronic configuration of molecules that
udes rotameric structures, both in the ground state and excited state having significant role
he fluorescence property of a molecule. Fluorescence of proteins and peptides often arise
m intrinsic chromospheres like tryptophan, tyrosine residues. Contribution from
nylalanine is very weak. However, the fluorescence from the proteins is often found to be
plicated and the time-resolved fluorescence analysis often found that the fluorescence decay
to multi-component lifetime parameters and with different amplitudes. Some experimental
theoretical investigations with tryptophan and tyrosine containing proteins and peptides
gested the existence of rotameric states as the source of different fluorescence components
erences are included in the revised manuscript). Rotameric model was proposed to explain
non-exponential fluorescence decay of tyrosine and tryptophan residues. Different degree of
ited state charge transfer that depends on the rotameric structure was proposed for different
rescence contribution. We showed that the tyrosine residue in Aß peptide attained largely
different rotameric states depending on the overall peptide conformation. This could be the
son behind observing different degree of fluorescence intensity in two separate conformation
es.

Abstract: no information on what kinds of experiments and calculations are reported in
paper.
. . We have thoroughly revised the manuscript. In the revised version, we added the
oduction section. We have mentioned about the experiments and calculations made in the
nuscript in the revised manuscript. The significant results are also mentioned in the abstract
he manuscript.
Introduction: it is in fact a summary of the results, but without clear statement on what
earch methods were used. No discussion of the current knowledge on Ab research.
. We are regretful for our mistake and have made amendments for the same in the revised
nuscript. As mentioned by the reviewer, we have rewritten the “Introduction” part
phasizing the recent advances in the research of Aß peptides. The “Introduction” mentions in
rt the experiments performed and the results obtained.
Pre-aggregates are known to exist in Ab when purchased from such suppliers. No
sideration of this is made in the article. Hexafluoroisopropanol has been used to minimise
(e.g. Stine, W.B.; Dahlgren, K.N.; Krafft, G.A.; and LaDu, M.J., In vitro characterization of
ditions for amyloid-beta peptide oligomerization and fibrillogenesis. J.Biol.Chem. 2003.
(13):11612-22).
. The reviewer has pointed out diligently that Aß peptides are prone to aggregation and using
IP is one of the most used solvents for solubilizing the aggregates. However, there are other
tocols to prevent aggregation of these peptides of which using alkaline buffer is most
mon. A typical Aß42 peptide (purchased from American Peptide Company) solution was
pared by adding 200 µL of 20 mM NaOH solution to 0.1mg of the peptide followed by
ication and vortexing until a clear solution is obtained. The solution was further centrifuged
emove all the particles (aggregates) and we also checked it by light scattering measurement.
fluorescence spectra were observed to have no significant scattering which enabled us to
clude that the peptide solution was mostly in the monomeric state. The experimental
hodology was adopted from Maiti et.al, Mechanistic Studies of Cu(II) Binding to Amyloid-ß
tides and the Fluorescence and Redox Behaviors of the Resulting Complexes. The Journal of
sical Chemistry B. 2008. 112(28): 8406-8411.
Aß42 peptides at the concentration of 20 µM tend to aggregate, so the fluorescence
ponse evolves in time. The authors consider their samples as stable solutions of non-
racting monomers, which is unlikely to be true.
. The concern of the reviewer is true, although literatures have pointed out that the Aß
tides donot tend to form aggregates in highly alkaline buffer and a certain incubation time
iod is required for the peptides to form aggregates. The stock solution of the peptide in
aline buffer ensures the peptide is maintained in monomeric condition. We have added the
rences in the main text (Nag et.al.2011 and Fezoui et.al.2000). Please note the explanation
en above
MD: Simulation time (50 ns) is surprisingly short. Only one trajectory has been
culated, no MD statistics given. In order to make any conclusions a number of trajectories and
r statistics are needed.
. As suggested by the reviewer, we have performed simulations in three different trajectories
the results are interpreted accordingly in the revised manuscript. New figures are added in
manuscript.
MD: Comment on constraining the geometry of water and heavy atom – hydrogen bonds
lines 18-25) is confusing: Both PME and PBC do not constrain any bonds.
. We apologize for the mistake made previously. We have corrected in the “Materials and
thods”.
No information on counter ions added. The distances between the peptide and the walls
he box are not given.
. We thank the reviewer for pointing out the mistake. We have now mentioned the details in
“Molecular dynamics” subsection of the “Materials and Methods”. The peptide was placed

his not somewhat surprising given the exposure to solvent?
. We respect the concern of the reviewer. Earlier reports suggested that tyrosine fluorescence
k position is less sensitive towards the polarity of the solvent, though tryptophan emission is
y sensitive to local environments (book on protein fluorescence by Lakowicz) Upon
reasing the methanol concentration the polarity of the solution changed, however, emission
ition was less effected and it may be due to intrinsic nature of the tyrosyl group itself. This
nt is added on the revised version of the manuscript but literatures have mentioned that the
rescence peak of tyrosine is slightly red shifted in DMSO, however, the peak position
ains unaltered in THF, isopropanol and methanol (Guzow et.al.2005).
The MD results should be compared with the data cited by recent papers in this field
. Amaro, M.; Kubiak-Ossowska, K.; Birch, D.J.S.; Rolinski, O.J., Methods Appl. Fluoresc.
3, 1, 015006).
. Amaro et al. also showed a hypothetical model and linked the fluorescence responses of the
tide with the rotamer conformations during the aggregation processes. Their molecular
amic simulation suggested a four-rotamer model of the tyrosine residue to explain the
rescence behavior of Aß aggregates (oligomers and fibers). In our investigation we showed
t in two different secondary structure of the peptide in monomeric state, the tyrosyl group
ulated in two different rotameric configurations.
P.10 lines 50-60: The paper compares the spectroscopic measurements of the samples
h many interacting and aggregating peptides with MD simulations of one isolated peptide
h no proper MD statistics. Therefore the conclusions of this paper are not well justified.
. It is interesting to study the intermolecular interactions but the current study is mainly
used on the studies with monomeric state of the peptide. We have concentrated on
ntaining the peptides in monomeric state in the freshly prepared sample, and the
rescence studies also identified no scattering indicating that the peptide did not undergo
omerization. As a result, the molecular simulations are also carried out with single peptide.
