Sultana and colleagues compare performance on standard behavioral tasks between several
commonly-used mouse strains. They show some significant differences in behavior,
demonstrating that caution is warranted when interpreting comparative data collected in
multiple strains. The manuscript is fairly straightforward and the quantification of differences in
behavior across strains could provide a valuable resource to the community. However, there are
several concerns about the manuscript as currently written:
-The authors make it sound as if researchers often attempt compare results across strains. This
would clearly be a problem, but how common is it? Does it occur in primary research studies,
and/or in reviews attempting to synthesize the literature? Citing some papers in which this sort
of problematic comparison is made, and how that has negatively affected the papers’ conclusions,
would bolster the rationale for the current manuscript.
-Is it possible that behavior was affected by the order in which the tests was performed? Keeping
the order consistent across strains is appropriate, but perhaps the results would have been
different had the experiments been conducted in a different order. Performing a new set of
experiments using a different order could address this possibility; alternatively, it may also be
possible to address it in the discussion section.
-Some strains appear to show much more (or less) variability than others on particular behavioral
tests. It might be valuable to quantify this variability, as it could indicate how to interpret the
results of a given test for a particular strain. For example, it seems notable that in Fig. 1A, C57BL6
mice exhibit much lower variability than, e.g., 129SvEv mice.
-The figure and table legends are missing.
-What is shown on the axes of Fig. 5D?
-It is not clear why the color scheme in Fig. 6A differs from that in the preceding figures.
-Fig. 8 seems out of order and isn’t referred to in the Results section. Also, it is not clear whether
there is any significance to the markers being colored red in this figure. Does this correspond to
the color scheme in other figures?
-There are numerous spelling errors, particularly in the Results section. Just as one example, p. 11

3.23 “…few inter-strain comparisons are available.” This is not really true in general. Perhaps
you need to be more specific? Unfortunately, failure to acknowledge the vastness of the literature
(or postponement to the Discussion as here) immediately raises a question in any reader’s mind
about the value of your work. I am not saying your work is not valuable, but failure to put it in
the context of the large available literature deprives your work of much of its potential value in
the mind of the reader. In case you find that your work is largely not original, that is not a real
problem, since – and I think this is an important and useful aspect of journals like RSOS –
“studies testing the reproducibility of significant work are encouraged”. You just need to be open
about this and highlight what part of your work is new and what is confirmatory. In any case, the
four references provided are only a small subset of the literature available, which addresses the
problem of background variation on two levels. First, many papers, stretching back many years,
address various aspects of genetic background and its contribution to differences in wildtype
behaviour. Second, beyond the issue of wildtype comparisons, there are reports of interactions of
induced mutations with genetic background. Many of these are anecdotal (single gene or
behaviour), but a couple of recent systematic studies were done, one by Sittig et al (many mutants
in multiple backgrounds, Neuron, 2016) and one by van de Lagemaat et al (three mutants in
C57BL/6J vs 129S5, Genes Brain and Behaviour, 2017). There are at least ten other references in
the latter paper looking at one or the other aspect of genetic background in mouse behaviour. I
also note you have more papers referenced further along in your manuscript.
5.28 boli? Call them fecal boli
5.33 put ref 19 with ref 20.
6.49 is it alterations or alternations? Please be consistent.
7.44 snuggly is not the same as snugly, the first of many typos.

8.23 Kruskal
9.9 in 7.5 lines of writing, 8 typos. Out of respect for your reviewers, proofreading for spelling,
punctuation and grammar are essential!
10.33 second half of the sentence is hard to follow and appears to jump to the conclusion that
mice produce faecal boli due to anxiety alone. Better to use the phraseology “observation X
suggests interpretation Y” rather than “we observed X because Y”.
10.37 What is the p-value of the correlation in Fig 8A? By looking, I doubt it is significant. A quick
check in R tells me the p-value for your rank correlation is 0.2333. You need more data (one data
point per animal?) to prove a correlation. Furthermore it is pretty clear that this is a strain effect.
Does this correlation (if it exists) also exist (i.e. achieve significance) within a strain?
10.52 129 mice exhibit less alternations than other strains. What might explain that? Could this be
because 129s are inactive?
11.3 129 also show greater perseveration. Why? Might this be because 129s are just inactive (Fig
1)?
11.6 How did you determine difficulty of 129 mice in changing arms? Or might it be they just
didn’t care, or were too anxious? How do you differentiate between these possibilities?
11.18 129 mice often exhibit bimodal activity, very active or very inactive, and this may change
within a day. C57BL/6J are much more active. When you then parameterise the performance of
an individual mouse by percentage of visits to the correct arm of the Y maze, your measures of
129 mice will vary widely, and this will decrease your power to detect a C57BL/6J-129 difference.
You need to understand and lead the reader through this.
11.38, 11.49 general tendency to inactivity in 129 mice is well known and predicts that they will
stop swimming or struggling sooner without needing to invoke any “depression”. You should
mention this confounding effect and address how significant your results are after accounting
quantitatively for this prediction.
12.18 Where did DISC1 (presumably k/o) mice come from? What background? What dataset
were you using? Or did you assess a cohort of mice? What methods did you use? What were the
controls? What was the hypothesis? Why were DISC1 mice not mentioned before? Where are the
relevant statistical methods? How does this fit into the context of the paper?
12.32 it seems surprising that 129 mice should have second-fewest stress calls when literature
suggests 129 strains generally are more anxious. Why is that? What confounds might account for
it?
13.20 How did you choose your animals for PCA? Choosing animals opens the door to gross bias
and forbids any interpretation of these results (unless you can provide an algorithm
demonstrating that these choices were made blind). Please remove this section from the paper.
13.43 You appear to jump to the conclusion that because wildtype mice differ in performance in
these tasks, mouse models of human disorders (which usually involve some induced mutation)
will also be affected. While this is certainly true at the level of gross measures (cm travelled, cm/s
speed, etc), the work of van de Lagemaat et al (2017) shows that this may not be the case, even for
backgrounds as different as C57BL/6J and 129S5, when one considers the Cohen d effect size of
5
the mutation. In other words, although the backgrounds may exhibit different baselines and
scales for behavioural measures, the behavioural change in mutants relative to wildtypes may
nevertheless be in the same direction and with the same number of standard deviations in both
strains.
15.10 here you finally mention Disc1. If it is important, move it up to the introduction.
15.26 on what basis do you argue that bimodal behaviour suggests variable penetrance? Is the
behaviour mode an immutable characteristic of an individual animal? How did you test this?
15.35 from the previous comment, you go on to say “other factors” than genetic background play
a crucial role in developing an animal’s behavioural phenotype. If lower mobility (for example in
129) were actually an immutable characteristic of an individual mouse, you might make this
claim. However, you have not tested this.
16.3 Again, because you have chosen a subset of mice for your PCA, the reader should ask if the
observed clusters are just an artefact of which animals were chosen. Probably you should remove
the PCA from the paper.
16.20 Are the results in this paper a useful baseline for further studies in neurological disorders?
People have been saying this for years, but when really carefully tested in light of mutation effect
sizes (number of standard deviations between mutant and wildtype) and random sampling, the
effect of background strain seems less important. I would not say UN-important, but less so. You
should address this in your manuscript too.
Overall conclusions:
Overall, there may be some good data here. It suffers from several major problems and needs a
lot of work before it is ready for publication:
1) In its initial form, the fact that in the introduction the manuscript largely ignores a huge
literature by very big-name individuals over many years is annoying and biases the informed
reader against the manuscript in its current form.
2) The experienced reviewer is further annoyed by the poor quality of the spelling and grammar
(although this is worse in some places than others). Figure 8 is out of order too. These show
general sloppiness. To address this, use a good grammar and spell checker and proofread your
manuscript (and have others proofread it) before sending it out. Your reputation as a scientist
depends in part on this.
3) There is a lack of sophistication in your work in that it lacks proper controls/baseline measures
(e.g. home cage behaviour).
4) There is a general lack of sophistication in your interpretation of the data, leading you to jump
to conclusions along the lines of commonly held views. This is also done without citing the
relevant papers. To address this, you should, first, read lots of papers in this field and seek to
internalise the careful language and arguments of others. It will help you make your own
arguments.
5) You nowhere mention the sex of the animals. Even if it has no impact on these measures (see
your Moy et al reference), it is generally a big issue in mouse models, so you should mention it
and mention how you tested/analysed it. If you didn’t test the effect of sex or use only one sex, it
greatly undermines your whole experiment.
6) Your study performs several assays on wildtype mice from five strains. Unfortunately, your
methods leave many questions unanswered. For example, in the sociability test is similar to one
done with five strains (a different set of strains) by others with much more finesse (i.e. including
olfactory tests and comparing to home cage behaviour) 14 years ago. That study was cited by
you (Moy et al, 2004). With time, we expect methods to improve, but this is not the case here. I

think you have made a good start, but you need a lot more controls and explanation before this
paper is ready for review or publication.

In the manuscript the authors aim to assess and draw attention to phenotypic differences in in-
bred moues strains. After a series of behavioral assessments conducted over 16 days the authors
conclude that there is a large variability in the response of different strains to various behavior
tasks and recommending that future experiments including these strains should be aware of
these differences prior to and during the interpretation of any results acquired through the use of
these mice as disease models.
The results of these studies draw attention to the importance of considering mouse strain when
designing your experiments. This concept is touched upon in other publications, but is not
always considered by experimenters. These studies are a good reminder of the importance of this
and provides some direct comparisons of common mouse strains that can aid experimenters in
their selection.
The behavior tasks utilized in this study seem to be carried out well and assessed well.
Experiments also appear to be spread out over a 16 day period and ordered in a manner that
places the most stressful experiments towards the end, controlling for the impact of stress
external to the desired behavioral experiment impacting the performance of the mice
Minor Criticisms:
-Author should emphasize a little more that any number of differences could be responsible for
their behavioral performance, besides just nicotinic binding sites and DISC1
-Authors should bring to attention other published differences found in 129SvEv line, as this is a
line they have chosen to emphasize, and how it compares to their results, for example: previous
studies regarding fear and extinction
- the use of CD1 as an outbred strain is a good one, but no discussion is made comparing the CD1
to the inbred strains and what that means.
7
-In the results section the results given by one strain is referred to as “normal” while the behavior
may be the anticipated result, the authors should refrain from the use of the word “normal” as
behavioral is considered “normal” only based on previous studies that have utilized specific
inbred mouse lines themselves (usually B6)
-there are many spelling errors throughout the manuscript that needs to be addressed,
particularly with the misspelling of the word “significant” and “significantly” which occurs at
several points throughout the manuscript.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Ryan Y Wong):
Dear Dr. Sultana,
Your manuscript was reviewed by 3 reviewers. Overall the reviewers agree that the data
presented in the manuscript could be of value to the field. However the reviewers have identified
a number of concerns, which are included. I agree with the concerns that the current manuscript
is not sufficiently placed within the broader context of the field or acknowledges the many
studies examining similar questions. I also share the view that the methodology and justification
for use of particular behavioral endpoints or data analyses are not clearly described, which makes
the data interpretation more difficult.

tana and colleagues compare performance on standard behavioral tasks between
eral commonly-used mouse strains. They show some significant differences in behavior,
onstrating that caution is warranted when interpreting comparative data collected in
ltiple strains. The manuscript is fairly straightforward and the quantification of
erences in behavior across strains could provide a valuable resource to the community.
wever, there are several concerns about the manuscript as currently written:
thank the reviewer for their comments, which have been used to improve the manuscript.
have used their comments in their entirety and we believe that the manuscript is much
roved as a result. We have included a version of the manuscript with revisions tracked.
authors make it sound as if researchers often attempt to compare results across
ins. This would clearly be a problem, but how common is it? Does it occur in primary
arch studies, and/or in reviews attempting to synthesize the literature? Citing some
ers in which this sort of problematic comparison is made, and how that has negatively
cted the papers’ conclusions, would bolster the rationale for the current manuscript.
e agree with the reviewer for the useful insight. As suggested, regarding the comparisons in
ew and primary studies where these comparisons have been made, the references have been
ed in the introduction of manuscript.
t possible that behavior was affected by the order in which the tests was performed?
ping the order consistent across strains is appropriate, but perhaps the results would
e been different had the experiments been conducted in a different order. Performing a
set of experiments using a different order could address this possibility; alternatively,
ay also be possible to address it in the discussion section.
e agree with the reviewer about the concern for the order of behavioral tests, we closely
owed the protocol by https://www.mousephenotype.org/impress and other similar studies
tioned in manuscript, where most stressful tests were performed at the end, and to avoid
ntion/latency problems the tests done on the same apparatus were performed in separate
ups of animals (for e.g. Spontaneous alternation and Y maze task for working memory)
me strains appear to show much more (or less) variability than others on particular
avioral tests. It might be valuable to quantify this variability, as it could indicate how to
rpret the results of a given test for a particular strain. For example, it seems notable
t in Fig. 1A, C57BL6 mice exhibit much lower variability than, e.g., 129SvEv mice.
agree with the authors observation. We have addressed this variability in the discussion.
have also used standard error of mean was calculated and depicted in the figures to
rmine and exhibit intra-strain variability
e figure and table legends are missing.
e apologize for any confusion. The figure and table legends alongside the figures were
oaded as separate files in previous submission.
hat is shown on the axes of Fig. 5D?
made the corrections as suggested and the axes title have been added.
s not clear why the color scheme in Fig. 6A differs from that in the preceding figures.
suggested we changed the color scheme of Fig. 6A to match all other figures in the
uscript.
. 8 seems out of order and isn’t referred to in the Results section. Also, it is not clear
ther there is any significance to the markers being colored red in this figure. Does this
respond to the color scheme in other figures?
e figure is mentioned in the results section. There was no significance to the red color of the
kers, we have changed these to solid black to avoid any confusion to the readers.
ere are numerous spelling errors, particularly in the Results section. Just as one
mple, p. 11 line 3 (significnatly, distnace, accross).
suggested, a complete and thorough revision was performed in order to (hopefully) rectify
he spelling and grammar errors.

“…few inter-strain comparisons are available.” This is not really true in
eral. Perhaps you need to be more specific? Unfortunately, failure to acknowledge the
tness of the literature (or postponement to the Discussion as here) immediately raises a
stion in any reader’s mind about the value of your work. I am not saying your work is
valuable, but failure to put it in the context of the large available literature deprives
r work of much of its potential value in the mind of the reader. In case you find that
r work is largely not original, that is not a real problem, since – and I think this is an
ortant and useful aspect of journals like RSOS – “studies testing the reproducibility of
ificant work are encouraged”. You just need to be open about this and highlight what
t of your work is new and what is confirmatory. In any case, the four references
vided are only a small subset of the literature available, which addresses the problem of
kground variation on two levels. First, many papers, stretching back many years,
ress various aspects of genetic background and its contribution to differences in
dtype behaviour. Second, beyond the issue of wildtype comparisons, there are reports of
ractions of induced mutations with genetic background. Many of these are anecdotal
gle gene or behaviour), but a couple of recent systematic studies were done, one by
ig et al (many mutants in multiple backgrounds, Neuron, 2016) and one by van de
emaat et al (three mutants in C57BL/6J vs 129S5, Genes Brain and Behaviour,
7). There are at least ten other references in the latter paper looking at one or the other
ect of genetic background in mouse behaviour. I also note you have more papers
renced further along in your manuscript.

3 second half of the sentence is hard to follow and appears to jump to the conclusion
t mice produce faecal boli due to anxiety alone. Better to use the phraseology
servation X suggests interpretation Y” rather than “we observed X because Y”.
suggested, we have reworded this section.
7 What is the p-value of the correlation in Fig 8A? By looking, I doubt it is significant.
uick check in R tells me the p-value for your rank correlation is 0.2333. You need more
a (one data point per animal?) to prove a correlation. Furthermore, it is pretty clear
t this is a strain effect. Does this correlation (if it exists) also exist (i.e. achieve
ificance) within a strain?
g. 8A, the p value is not significant as noted by the reviewer due to the fewer number of data
nts, but the r value of Spearman rank correlation shows a moderate correlation, whereas when
ulated with all the data sets (i.e. one point per animal for individual strains) none of the
ins, except BALB/c shows a positive significant correlation.
8B, there exists a positive significant correlation between the individual animals’ mobility
e in the forced swim and tail suspension tests. We have noted these in the results.
2 129 mice exhibit less alternations than other strains. What might explain that? Could
be because 129s are inactive?
e understand reviewer’s concern, but the calculations are based on percent entries to the
ed zones, rather than the absolute numbers. Furthermore, each strain acts as its own control in
ay that a threshold has been set for all of them i.e. only the animals making a total of or more
10 entries to all the arms were considered qualified for inclusion.
129 also show greater perseveration. Why? Might this be because 129s are just
ctive (Fig 1)?
gain, as with the above, we only included animals that were active and made a minimum of
entries.
How did you determine difficulty of 129 mice in changing arms? Or might it be they
didn’t care, or were too anxious? How do you differentiate between these possibilities?
have removed this statement.
8 129 mice often exhibit bimodal activity, very active or very inactive, and this may
nge within a day. C57BL/6J are much more active. When you then parameterize the
formance of an individual mouse by percentage of visits to the correct arm of the Y
ze, your measures of 129 mice will vary widely, and this will decrease your power to
ect a C57BL/6J-129 difference. You need to understand and lead the reader through
.
ain, we understand the reviewer’s concern regarding the activity of the 129S mouse. We
y included those animals that exhibited enough exploratory behavior during the closed arm
se in this analysis.
8, 11.49 general tendency to inactivity in 129 mice is well known and predicts that they
stop swimming or struggling sooner without needing to invoke any “depression”. You
uld mention this confounding effect and address how significant your results are after
ounting quantitatively for this prediction.
agree with the reviewer and have revised this section to note this potentially confounding
ct here. Our results though corroborate previous experiments, such as those carried out by
mez-Sintes et al. 2014, demonstrating other depressive-like symptoms in this strain.
8 Where did DISC1 (presumably k/o) mice come from? What background? What
aset were you using? Or did you assess a cohort of mice? What methods did you use?
at were the controls? What was the hypothesis? Why were DISC1 mice not mentioned
ore? Where are the relevant statistical methods? How does this fit into the context of the
er?
apologize for this typographic error. This has been changed to 129SvEv.
2 it seems surprising that 129 mice should have second-fewest stress calls when
rature suggests 129 strains generally are more anxious. Why is that? What confounds
ht account for it?
agree that this is surprising. We suggest that the stress calls in this case are fewer because
were recorded when the animal was put under stress of tail suspension, also the threshold
nsity for filtering the calls was more than 30kHz with a minimum duration of 5ms.The other
found could be due to the time of the day when the recordings were done (in the first half of
day).
0 How did you choose your animals for PCA? Choosing animals opens the door to
ss bias and forbids any interpretation of these results (unless you can provide an
orithm demonstrating that these choices were made blind). Please remove this section
m the paper.
animals that were behaviorally tested were added for the PCA. The distinction between the
PCA analyses is that some animals were removed from the Y-maze analysis, due to not
ting the threshold for number of entries. Thus, one analysis includes all animals that
pleted all tests, while the other includes all animals that completed the tests, except for the
aze.
3 You appear to jump to the conclusion that because wildtype mice differ in
formance in these tasks, mouse models of human disorders (which usually involve some
uced mutation) will also be affected. While this is certainly true at the level of gross
asures (cm travelled, cm/s speed, etc), the work of van de Lagemaat et al (2017) shows
t this may not be the case, even for backgrounds as different as C57BL/6J and 129S5,
n one considers the Cohen d effect size of the mutation. In other words, although the
kgrounds may exhibit different baselines and scales for behavioral measures, the
avioral change in mutants relative to wildtypes may nevertheless be in the same
ction and with the same number of standard deviations in both strains.
completely agree and thank the reviewer for their insightful comment. We have
nowledged and incorporated the suggested concept in the manuscript to give readers another
w of dealing with the problem of influence of genetic background on the behavior of animals.
have also added a concluding paragraph that emphasizes this point. This is also true that the
sideration of Cohen d effect size of mutation can help us avoid the existing problem, but it
ht require us to increase our sample size when the mutations on two different backgrounds
compared. Here in our study we are primarily trying to re-enforce the pre-existing notion that
e is a behavioral difference among the animals based on their genetic background.
0 here you finally mention Disc1. If it is important, move it up to the introduction.
suggested, we have introduced the Disc1 mutation in the Introduction.
6 on what basis do you argue that bimodal behavior suggests variable penetrance? Is
behavior mode an immutable characteristic of an individual animal? How did you test
?
have removed this statement.
5 from the previous comment, you go on to say “other factors” than genetic
kground play a crucial role in developing an animal’s behavioral phenotype. If lower
bility (for example in 129) were actually an immutable characteristic of an individual
use, you might make this claim. However, you have not tested this.
agree that we have not tested the immutability of these behaviors in these strains. We have
pered our statements to remove any speculative statements.
Again, because you have chosen a subset of mice for your PCA, the reader should ask
e observed clusters are just an artefact of which animals were chosen. Probably you
uld remove the PCA from the paper.
e understand the reviewer’s concern, but we included all the animals to perform PCA, as
d above,
0 Are the results in this paper a useful baseline for further studies in neurological
rders? People have been saying this for years, but when really carefully tested in light
utation effect sizes (number of standard deviations between mutant and wildtype) and
dom sampling, the effect of background strain seems less important. I would not say
-important, but less so. You should address this in your manuscript too.
e completely agree with the reviewer’s comments. As per the suggestion by the reviewer we
e added a concluding paragraph that addresses this important issue directly.
rall conclusions:
rall, there may be some good data here. It suffers from several major problems and
ds a lot of work before it is ready for publication:
n its initial form, the fact that in the introduction the manuscript largely ignores a huge
rature by very big-name individuals over many years is annoying and biases the
rmed reader against the manuscript in its current form.
ain, we thank the reviewer for their comments. We apologize for any omissions and have
sed the manuscript to include many sources that were previously omitted.
he experienced reviewer is further annoyed by the poor quality of the spelling and
mmar (although this is worse in some places than others). Figure 8 is out of order too.
se show general sloppiness. To address this, use a good grammar and spell checker and
ofread your manuscript (and have others proofread it) before sending it out. Your
utation as a scientist depends in part on this.
ain, we apologize for the poor quality of editing in the prior draft. We have attempted to
ove all such errors in this resubmission.
here is a lack of sophistication in your work in that it lacks proper controls/baseline
asures (e.g. home cage behaviour).
thank the reviewer for their comments and have addressed this in the resubmission.
here is a general lack of sophistication in your interpretation of the data, leading you to
p to conclusions along the lines of commonly held views. This is also done without
ng the relevant papers. To address this, you should, first, read lots of papers in this field
seek to internalise the careful language and arguments of others. It will help you make
r own arguments.
agree with the reviewer and have revised the discussion in the revision.
ou nowhere mention the sex of the animals. Even if it has no impact on these measures
your Moy et al reference), it is generally a big issue in mouse models, so you should
ntion it and mention how you tested/analysed it. If you didn’t test the effect of sex or use
y one sex, it greatly undermines your whole experiment.
apologize for this omission and have included the genders used in this resubmission. We
d mice of both genders and analyzed for gender effects, but did not observe any differences
hese tests. We have noted this in the manauscript.
our study performs several assays on wildtype mice from five strains. Unfortunately,
r methods leave many questions unanswered. For example, in the sociability test is
ilar to one done with five strains (a different set of strains) by others with much more
sse (i.e. including olfactory tests and comparing to home cage behaviour) 14 years
. That study was cited by you (Moy et al, 2004). With time, we expect methods to
rove, but this is not the case here. I think you have made a good start, but you need a
more controls and explanation before this paper is ready for review or publication.
in, we thank the reviewer and have attempted to address their criticisms in the revision.

red moues strains. After a series of behavioral assessments conducted over 16 days the
hors conclude that there is a large variability in the response of different strains to
ious behavior tasks and recommending that future experiments including these strains
uld be aware of these differences prior to and during the interpretation of any results
uired through the use of these mice as disease models.
results of these studies draw attention to the importance of considering mouse strain
n designing your experiments. This concept is touched upon in other publications but is
always considered by experimenters. These studies are a good reminder of the
ortance of this and provides some direct comparisons of common mouse strains that
aid experimenters in their selection.
behavior tasks utilized in this study seem to be carried out well and assessed well.

thors should bring to attention other published differences found in 129SvEv line, as
is a line they have chosen to emphasize, and how it compares to their results, for
mple: previous studies regarding fear and extinction
suggested by the reviewer, relevant literature and text is added.
e use of CD1 as an outbred strain is a good one, but no discussion is made comparing
CD1 to the inbred strains and what that means.
scussion regarding the behavior difference of CD1 mouse is added.
the results section the results given by one strain is referred to as “normal” while the
avior may be the anticipated result, the authors should refrain from the use of the word
rmal” as behavioral is considered “normal” only based on previous studies that have
ized specific inbred mouse lines themselves (usually B6)
e changes are made to the text, and caution was observed while using comparative
ements.
re are many spelling errors throughout the manuscript that needs to be addressed,
ticularly with the misspelling of the word “significant” and “significantly” which occurs
everal points throughout the manuscript.

thank the reviewer for the appreciation.
Make sure you reference Fig 2B, C, D in the main text; Correct the legend of Figure 2:
ude description of incorrect entries and a description of panel D.
e thank the reviewer for taking note, the correction has been made.
1 Fig 3, make sure you reference panels A and B in the legend.
suggested, both the panels (A and B) for Fig. 3 have been referenced.

es before, and include Figure 8 in Figure 1
suggested, we have corrected the placement and discussion of this figure.
0 Ref to fig 8B is out of place

indicated, we have made a mention about Fig. 6B in the main text.
1 Restructure sentence beginning “There was a...”. Suggest “At 30 ms and 75dB there
e significant differences between A and B (P < 0.001), C and D (P < 0.05), and E and F
0.05).” Note most significant result first.
suggested, we have reworded this section.
1 In legend of Fig 7, clarify the x-axis labels, with a statement like “X-axis labels
resent duration (30 vs 100 ms) and intensity (75 vs 85 dB).”. Also, clarify what the bars
resent: mean? Include error bars, or better, plot bee-swarm plots as in other figures,
wing all data for individual mice.
thank you for your kind suggestion, axis title has been added to the figure caption. Figure
icts the mean, and for more clarity to the readers error bars have been added.
8 Your PCA is remarkably clustered, but I was surprised that in the n=8 case there are
ays only 8 mice shown, and in the n=6 case, there are always only 6 mice shown. Did
manually choose which mice you included? If so, the analysis is biased, and I would
you to please remove it. If you did not choose the mice, please mention this with a
ement like, “Remarkably, exactly 6 of 12 mice of each line completed all assays, and
se are shown in Fig 9B”.
suggested we have added the above sentence in the main text, and Fig. 6A (n=8) has been
oved to avoid any bias.

mments to the Author(s)
authors have addressed most of my previous comments and improved the manuscript.
e remaining minor comment is that Figure 8 still seems to be out of order: Fig. 8A is
rred to after Fig. 2, and Fig. 8B is referred to after Fig. 5.
suggested, we have corrected the placement and discussion of these figures.
