Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
Due to a crisis of under-reporting of anthrax in Africa I believe that this paper has merit,
however, the context of the paper needs to be reframed if a One-Health intervention approach is
to be suggested.
Comments are included in the document as well.
1. The risk of exposure is vaguely stated as "sporadic outbreaks." Please include more detail for
the period during which the reporting was done. Even historical stats for the region from
literature will suffice.
2. The interface needs to be clearly defined in terms of wildlife-livestock-human interaction. Is it a
soft border interface or a hard border? Are there any interventions during outbreaks such as
vaccination or prophylaxis by any state authorities (veterinary or medical)? This needs to be
stated in the introduction to form the context of the risk of disease exposure.
3. There are insufficient references used in this paper. You need to include older references as
well, especially when introducing the organism and disease.
4. Be careful of referring to any part of the bacterium with the disease's name e.g. "anthrax
spores." It is B. anthracis spores which cause the syndrome and disease known as anthrax.
5. You initially mention that animal health and medical professionals were consulted for their
views, but thereafter fail to elaborate during results and discussion.
6. I don't have any issue with the odd ratios as presented in table 1, however, in the questionnaire
you include variables that are not included in any part of the discussion. The drinking of river
water during a large scale outbreak would certainly pose a risk. As would the buying in of
animals. The multivariate analysis ousted the other variables, but there was a bias in numbers of
younger demographic in your study...so while the age demographics were highlighted, the
biologically relevant variables need to be discussed in that context and not just as the
demographics pertain to the anthropological roles within those communities. The latency
analysis should reflect this.
7. It was briefly mentioned that the people in the interface area are exposed to anthrax infected
game. In the questionnaire, it is not clear whether people ever consume meat from sick/dead
animals or process the skins of dead wildlife etc.??
8. The document has several grammatical errors that need to be checked editorially.
9. The conclusion of "a One Health approach would be needed to mount an effective preventive
and control measures of anthrax outbreaks in the interface areas of northern Tanzania" is an
ambiguous one. If the aim was to identify causal agents of cutaneous anthrax from
anthropological cues within the communities then solid recommendations should follow the
findings of the latency analysis. What Africa needs is practical recommendations to cite to policy
makers based on solid field data. The community practices and behaviours as it pertains to
disease risk is the most worthwhile part of the paper and these are the points that should be
stressed and highlighted.

As to the referencing. Please see my comment.
Overall, your paper is good, but I have suggested the rewording and restructure of your

proved a robust indicator of infection and that education remains a barrier to effective control,

Royal Society Open Science
Dear Sir/Madam
Re: Submission of the revised Manuscript entitled ‘Risk factors for human
cutaneous anthrax outbreaks in the hot-spot districts of Northern
Tanzania: an unmatched case – control study’ (ID RSOS-180479).
Reference is made to the caption above.
We acknowledge receipt of the reviewer’s comments and they were very logic
and meaningful towards improving the manuscript. We have worked on the
comments and the following are the specific responses to all the issues, which
have been raised:
Specific Reviewer’s comments
Reviewer 1
(1) The risk of exposure is vaguely stated as "sporadic outbreaks." Please
include more detail for the period during which the reporting was done. Even
historical stats for the region from literature will suffice.
Author’s response: Clarification has been made and historical statistics are
included in the revised manuscript, see Page 3 lines 49 to 61
(2) The interface needs to be clearly defined in terms of wildlife-livestock-
human interaction. Is it a soft border interface or a hard border? Are there any
interventions during outbreaks such as vaccination or prophylaxis by any state
authorities (veterinary or medical)? This needs to be stated in the introduction
to form the context of the risk of disease exposure.
1
Author’s response: The wildlife-livestock-human interaction has been
defined on page 6 lines 114 – 121
(3) There are insufficient references used in this paper. You need to include
older references as well, especially when introducing the organism and
disease.
Author’s response: More references are added; see pages 19 – 24 on the list
of references
(4) Be careful of referring to any part of the bacterium with the disease's name
e.g. "anthrax spores." It is B. anthracis spores, which cause the syndrome and
disease known as anthrax.
Author’s response: Amendment on B. anthracis spores has been made
throughout the Manuscript
(5) You initially mention that animal health and medical professionals were
consulted for their views, but thereafter fail to elaborate during results and
discussion.
Author’s response: Hopefully this is now better addressed in the text.
(6) I don't have any issue with the odd ratios as presented in table 1; however,
in the questionnaire you include variables that are not included in any part of
the discussion. The drinking of river water during a large-scale outbreak
would certainly pose a risk. As would the buying in of animals. The
multivariate analysis ousted the other variables, but there was a bias in
numbers of younger demographic in your study...so while the age
demographics were highlighted, the biologically relevant variables need to be
discussed in that context and not just as the demographics pertain to the
anthropological roles within those communities. The latency analysis should
reflect this.
Author’s response: variables are clarified on the results in page 12 lines 235
to 237. The part of drinking water was not used for this article because the
Questionnaire was used in other papers… where water related issues are
covered. The bias linked to age groups has been emphasized a bit more in the
discussion section.
(7) It was briefly mentioned that the people in the interface area are exposed
to anthrax-infected game. In the questionnaire, it is not clear whether people
2
ever consume meat from sick/dead animals or process the skins of dead
wildlife etc.??
Author’s response: The questionnaire was not only used for this study
(8) The document has several grammatical errors that need to be checked
editorially.
Author’s response: We have gone through the text again, and also checked
using the Grammarly® software (https://app.grammarly.com/)
(9) The conclusion of "a One Health approach would be needed to mount an
effective preventive and control measures of anthrax outbreaks in the interface
areas of northern Tanzania" is an ambiguous one. If the aim was to identify
causal agents of cutaneous anthrax from anthropological cues within the
communities then solid recommendations should follow the findings of the
latency analysis. What Africa needs are practical recommendations to cite to
policy makers based on solid field data. The community practices and
behaviours as it pertains to disease risk is the most worthwhile part of the
paper and these are the points that should be stressed and highlighted.
Author’s response: The conclusion has been revised and solid
recommendations have been provided for policy makers to act upon, see on
page 16 lines 341 – 345
We are looking forward to your positive consideration.
Yours sincerely,

Specific Reviewer’s comments
Reviewer: 1
(1) I have made some editorial changes. If you agree with them, please feel to
