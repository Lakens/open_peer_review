The authors have done a neat job in designing and executing the preparation and characterization
of this material. This research is novel and well presented. Here are some suggestions for the
authors to consider:
1. Have you compared carbon nanotubes before and after the acid treatment? It shows in TEM
images that the FeNPs and PdNPs are actually larger than the diameter of the tubes, it's uncertain
whether PdNPs are inside the tube or not.
2. Have you done a mass balance check of the three systems? How much TCE were still left
adsorbed on nano tube, and how much have been transformed to ethane? If these end-products
are ploted in one figure, it will be more clear to readers how TCE was adsorbed and later
degraded to ethane with time.
3. The unit of the produced H2 is uL, should it be mole?

Wang et al., submitted a manuscript with a detailed characterization of a fascinating, well-
structured, reactive material with Pd and NZVI spatially separated by a carbon nanotube wall,
for TCE dechlorination. Their design avoids excessive NZVI corrosion, and thus works around on
of the potential problems of bimetallic reactive sorbents. While the scientific work is of a high
standard, the English writing is poor. I recommend that the American co-author carefully edits
the writing before resubmission of the manuscript. I started to do language corrections, but there
3
were too many for me to address. In addition, the authors need to discuss somewhere in the
manuscript limitations to the practical application of these materials, especially costs. Pd costs as
much as gold, so even low amounts of Pd impregnation will create a very costly material for the
intended remediation applications. In line with other reactive sorbent publications, the authors
use high reactive sorbent to liquid ratios (5 g/L), which would be costly in real-world
applications. Furthermore, a clean water system with TCE as the only water pollutant is used in
the batch studies. Real world TCE polluted matrices such as wastewater or groundwater may
contain dissolved organic carbon which can foul the reactive sorbents. Also, while the Fe
corrosion is clearly higher for the material with the co-deposited Fe/Pd in this paper, there is no
evidence that this corrosion affects the TCE dechlorination effectiveness in this study. While the
materials science in this study is excellent, some of the limitations with regards to the engineering
application of these materials should be acknowledged in the introduction or conclusions.

Overall, the authors have adequately address the comments made by the reviewers, and the
manuscript is scientifically sound and of high scientific quality. While the English writing has
been greatly improved from the initial version, there are still several spelling errors and sentences
which don't read smoothly in English. Examples:
"According to the current situation, the materials are high-cost
because of Pd as a noble metals, but the paper presents a synthetic method of nanoiron that
reduced the corrosion of NZVI and improved the hydrogen utilization ratio."
"This manuscripts was not involved the ethics problems."

Appendix A
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers' comments concerning
our manuscript entitled “Preparation of Palladized Carbon Nanotubes
Encapsulated Iron Composites: Highly Efficient Dechlorination for TCE
and Low Corrosion of Nanoiron” (Manuscript ID: RSOS-172242). We
have reviewed the comments carefully and have made correction which
we hope would meet your standards.
Referee: 1
The authors have done a neat job in designing and executing the
preparation and characterization of this material. This research is novel
and well presented. Here are some suggestions for the authors to
consider:
1. Have you compared carbon nanotubes before and after the acid
treatment? It shows in TEM images that the FeNPs and PdNPs are
actually larger than the diameter of the tubes, it's uncertain whether
PdNPs are inside the tube or not.
Response: As the Reviewer suggested, We have compared carbon
nanotubes before and after the acid treatment in the pre-experiment phase.
The BET results showed the CNTs that was not treated by nitric acid have
quite small surface area. The removal efficiency of TCE were not
favorable in the pre-experiment phase. The surface area of CNTs can be
enlarged by nitric acid treatment (Table 1) and the hydrophilic functional
groups of CNTs were also increased, therefore it can increase the capacity
of metal loading and minimize the losses of ferric salt inthe synthesizing
process. Many papers have presented that acid treatments is a major step
during the preparation process of material loading.
Pd NPs located on the surface of CNTs were observed in Figure. 4c.
The CNTs were filled with water in the preparation process and
palladium salt that dissolved in the xylene is unlikely to enter into the
CNTs, therefore most of Pd NPs are outside of CNTs.
2. Have you done a mass balance check of the three systems? How much
TCE were still left adsorbed on nano tube, and how much have been
transformed to ethane? If these end-products are ploted in one figure, it
will be more clear to readers how TCE was adsorbed and later degraded
to ethane with time.
Response: As the Reviewer suggested , we have plot these
end-products in one figure (Figure. 7a,7b).It shows TCE was adsorbed
and later degraded to ethane. According to the mass balance check, Cl is
about 0.045mmol in the end , This indicated TCE was degraded
completely by Fe@CNTs@Pd or Fe/Pd@CNTs. We calculated the
conversions of end-products, 67% TCE were converted to ethane and can
be detected. Other 33% were adsorbed on the composite material. (line
341-line 349).
3. The unit of the produced H2 is uL, should it be mole?
Response: This is an excellent suggestion. Changing the unit of
produced H2 to mole can make it easier to compare the results. The unit
of the produced H2 were changed to mole in the manuscript.
Special thanks to you for your good comments.
Referee: 2
Wang et al., submitted a manuscript with a detailed characterization
of a fascinating, well-structured, reactive material with Pd and NZVI
spatially separated by a carbon nanotube wall, for TCE dechlorination.
Their design avoids excessive NZVI corrosion, and thus works around on
of the potential problems of bimetallic reactive sorbents.
While the scientific work is of a high standard, the English writing is
poor. I recommend that the American co-author carefully edits the writing
before resubmission of the manuscript. I started to do language
corrections, but there were too many for me to address.
Response: We are very sorry for our English language errors. Thank
you for your suggestion and we have carefully revised the manuscript
together with the American co-author.
In addition, the authors need to discuss somewhere in the manuscript
limitations to the practical application of these materials, especially costs.
Pd costs as much as gold, so even low amounts of Pd impregnation will
create a very costly material for the intended remediation applications. In
line with other reactive sorbent publications, the authors use high reactive
sorbent to liquid ratios (5 g/L), which would be costly in real-world
applications. Furthermore, a clean water system with TCE as the only
water pollutant is used in the batch studies. Real world TCE polluted
matrices such as wastewater or groundwater may contain dissolved
organic carbon which can foul the reactive sorbents. Also, while the Fe
corrosion is clearly higher for the material with the co-deposited Fe/Pd in
this paper, there is no evidence that this corrosion affects the TCE
dechlorination effectiveness in this study. While the materials science in
this study is excellent, some of the limitations with regards to the
engineering application of these materials should be acknowledged in the
introduction or conclusions.
Response: Thank you for your detailed review and suggestions. As
you mentioned, Pd is indeed a noble metals. In practical situations the
cost would be too high if the materials are used on a large scale, and there
are many other problems in practical applications, for example, many
dissolved organic substance in groundwater could influence the reaction
process of TCE. This manuscript mainly focuses on the material
preparation that can reduce the corrosion of NZVI and improve the
hydrogen utilization ratio. In the conclusion, we introduced the sections
discussing the materials application in the real world situations. (line
411-line 415) The Reviewer’s suggestion is very valuable, and it is also a
direction for improvement for this material in further studies. In the future
research, we will explore the possibility of reducing the cost and
expanding the practical applications for this material.
Special thanks to you for your detailed review and valuable comments.
We tried our best to improve the manuscript and made some changes
in the manuscript. These changes will not influence the content and
framework of the paper.
We sincerely appreciate the Editor’s/Reviewers' detailed work, and
hope that the correction will meet the standards.
Once again, thank you very much for your comments and
suggestions.

Comments to the Author(s)
Overall, the authors have adequately address the comments made by the
reviewers, and the manuscript is scientifically sound and of high scientific
quality.
1. While the English writing has been greatly improved from the initial
version, there are still several spelling errors and sentences which don't
read smoothly in English. Examples:
"According to the current situation, the materials are high-cost
because of Pd as a noble metals, but the paper presents a synthetic method
of nanoiron that reduced the corrosion of NZVI and improved the hydrogen
utilization ratio."
"This manuscripts was not involved the ethics problems."
Response: We are very sorry for our English language errors. We are
truly grateful to the reviewer’ suggestions on English. The above sentences
were corrected as follows:
"It is acknowledged that the application of this material is still subject
to its high cost due to the price of Pd. In the future work, we will look into
alternative low-cost catalysts to replace Pd for new synthesized
composites."
"It was not required to complete an ethical assessment prior to
conducting the research."
Based on these comments, we have made careful modifications on the
manuscript with the American co-author, main changes made to the text
are in red color.
2. I recommend that the American co-author once more re-read this
final version of the manuscript to make sure all the English writing is of an

Response: We have consulted native English speakers for paper
revision before the submission this time. We hope the new manuscript will
meet your magazine’s standard.
We tried our best to improve the manuscript and made some changes
in the manuscript. These changes will not influence the content and
