This is a well written manuscript on an important topic for global carnivore conservation. The
authors use an interesting approach incorporating both wildlife ecology and human dimensions
to understand habitat use by canids, and relate that back to human-wildlife conflicts, before
making inferences on habitat conservation/protected area expansion in a working landscape in
India. However, I have major concerns about the results of this study that undermine the
findings. For the wild canid occupancy modeling effort, the 95% confidence intervals around the
beta estimates for all of the covariates for each species include 0. Moreover, the standard errors
are larger than the beta estimates in many cases. This is a clear indication that the results are
poor, at best, and any inferences based on these results may be spurious. Furthermore, the
authors indicate on line 225 in the text that covariate-specific estimates of detection and
occupancy probabilities are model averaged estimates. However, the caption for table 4 indicates
that the estimates are from the model in which a covariate first appears. Model averaged
estimates would be most appropriate to report, given the model selection uncertainty that is
present in most cases.
The estimates of site-level richness are calculated from the species-specific occupancy modeling
effort, and these results are not acceptable from a
Based on the model-selection tables for feral dog occupancy, the constant model has at least equal
explanatory power as the next best model explaining occupancy for this species, which is human
settlement. The authors do not address this in the text, and any estimates of predicted feral dog
occupancy should be model averaged estimates. It is not clear in the text if model averaged
estimates are reported, and the 95% confidence interval for the reported beta estimate for the
influence of human settlements on feral dog occupancy includes 0.
Based on the results of the Depredation Patterns and Determinants occupancy modeling effort,
this is the strongest attribute of the manuscript. If the editors decide to invite revisions to the
manuscript, the revised manuscript should be based solely on this modeling effort.

Manuscript title: A socio-ecological framework for examining human-carnivore interactions:
Sympatric wild canids in India as case study
This manuscript examines the relationship between carnivore distribution and patterns of
livestock depredation in multi-use heterogeneous landscapes. The authors build upon an
occupancy modeling framework combined with structured interviews towards village residents,
to assess the impacts of carnivore depredation on husbandry activities and how environmental
and social factors help explain interaction patterns and to map conflict-prone areas. The
manuscript is well written, for which I applaud the authors, the language is clear, and sections
are well structured. Sampling design is robust and occupancy models seem to have been properly
fitted. Both occupancy and detection parameters seem to have been carefully thought. However,
dealing with some issues must preclude publication, such as the translation of results into
insights to land-use policy, strategies for conflict mitigation or conservation of shared landscapes
(step 4 of the study framework). Some details on methods need to be clarified, to allow
reproducibility, even if the complete dataset is available (as is the case in this manuscript).
Overall, this is a good manuscript that I would like to see published, once the concerns I present
are resolved.
Specific issues:
Title: The title suggests that the authors are originally describing a new method, in a
methodological paper on the use of this innovative socio-ecological framework, which is not the
case. As far as I understood, the authors build upon an existing method, to evaluate a biological
question with conservation-related purposes.
Abstract:
P2 L46-47: Which results? Which conclusions?
Introduction:
P4 L93: “We examined factors that facilitate coexistence…” This phrase should be re-written,
because, as it is, it indicates factors the prevent conflict. If this is not what you mean by it, please
re-write.
P4 L100: The use of “, and,” with two commas should be avoided throughout the text.
Materials and methods:
L110: The use of semicolon in this phrase should be checked.
Figure 1
-state
occupancy models: if the ecological/environmental predictors have already been used during the
5
single-species occupancy modeling phase, then the outcome of such models (the carnivore
distribution) should not be included in another model (multi-state occupancy models) in addition
to the ecological/environmental predictors once again. This double incorporation will result in
overfitted models, due to correlation (spatial or environmental) among predictors, and spurious
relationships among environmental/ecological predictors and carnivore occupancy. If this is not
the case (environmental predictors have not been included twice), please check the text and
clarify this section.
Step 3: If carnivore distribution is an input of integrated multi-state occupancy models, shouldn’t
it be presented in box 2?
Field survey section
I had to read this section a couple of times to understand that single-season and multi-state
occupancy models had not been calibrated with the same data (scat signs or interviews). Please
clarify this section, explicitly indicating which data belong to which modelling framework. In
addition, I suggest the elaboration of another figure, in a conceptual or workflow scheme, to
allow better understanding of methods and procedures, especially because there are several and
different modelling steps, which use and require different data inputs.
Dog occupancy and wild carnivore richness
Model selection procedures were not explained. How did authors evaluate and select among top-
ranking models? A table of species-specific models, showing covariates combinations, could be
incorporated, maybe as a supplementary material.
Results
The section describing habitat use/occupancy by wild carnivores is a bit confuse, in my opinion.
There are many relationships, so maybe re-writing and organizing the results per species could
improve readability.
P8 - L238: Hyenas are notorious by their necrophagous behavior, so I wonder why the authors
included it as a target species in a paper on the factors that contribute to human-carnivore
conflict… If the scavenger behavior of hyenas is notorious and unambiguous, was there some
indication, maybe personal experience in the field observing hyenas predating livestock or
poultry, that would justify the inclusion of such species? If there was not, I believe that the a
priori expectation of a relationship is not reasonable and that the species should be removed.
P9 L253-257: The lack of relationship between carnivore richness and dog occupancy, in addition
to the species avoidance/congruence in space, is an interesting result, that was overlooked in the
Discussion section.
Discussion
P9 L268-272: The authors argue that dhole occupancy was low, even though “forests constitute
more that 80% of the habitats” in the study area, but I wonder what the occupancy of dholes on
intact forests is. If dholes are generally rare, even on preserved habitat, there is no reason to
expect its high occupancy on any landscape.
The section on the interaction between domestic dogs and wild carnivores should be elaborated,
especially related to the fact that species do not avoid each other in the scale proposed.
P12 L365-368: The discussion on separation into micro-habitats is speculative, because the authors
do not present evidence (results or literature) that overlap at landscape scale may result in habitat
differentiation in more local scales.
P10 L300-305: Nonetheless, dhole occupancy was overall low, and hyenas are not expected to
prey on animal husbandry (or are they?).
P13 L378: Please explain the “triage” scenario.
Overall, maybe it would be better to avoid excessive adjectives, such as ardent (L381), formidable
(L391).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_5
The authors have disregarded my major concerns with their interpretation of results, therefore, I
still recommend major revisions or rejection. In their response, the authors state that studies of
large carnivore occupancy rarely produce statistically significant results, particularly when
covariates are Z-transformed prior to analysis. This is simply not the case. Moreover, Z-
transformation of covariates usually increases the performance of Occupancy models, and lowers
SE values.
As for model averaging of beta estimates for individual covariates, see Grueber et al. 2011,
Journal of Evolutionary Biology.
While I agree that betas with an SE including 0 can indicate the direction of a relationship, there is
so much uncertainty in the estimates presented in tables 4 & 5 that even the direction of the
relationship is in question. On the extreme end, how can the direction of a relationship be
determined with a confidence interval of -1.02 - 1.1 (wolf/agri; table 4) be interpreted? In their
comments, the authors agree that there is very little support for a covariate when the SE is larger
than the beta estimate for that covariate. Why are those covariates still included in the tables,
then? At a bare minimum, please remove those estimates from the tables. I.E., sambar,
agriculture, and dogs, should not be included as a covariate for any of the models in Table 4. The
model for wolf should not include livestock, the model for jackal should not include forest cover,
the model for fox should not include scrub or ruggedness, and the model for hyena should only
include livestock. The same standards should be applied to the models presented in table 5.
New predictions will need to be made from models not containing the covariates that need to be
removed, and the results and discussion should be modified to reflect all of the above changes.

Royal Society Open Science RSOS-181041: A socio-ecological
framework for examining humancarnivore interactions: Sympatric
wild canids in India as a case study
This paper employs a relatively novel approach, combining ecological and social data to identify
factors that facilitate and impede coexistence between humans and four wild canid species in India,
and in turn, provide refreshingly practical suggestions for canid conservation. I think that this is a
high-quality piece of research and my comments are very minor. I am however unqualified to
critique the statistical approach used and recommend that a reviewer with experience in this type of
analysis be consulted.
Minor revisions
L41: It would be useful to mention the survey method used. Also, it is unclear here whether you
mean that occupancy of both dholes and jackals was influenced by habitat type, or that the variation
in occupancy between dholes and jackals is due to habitat type (rather than interspecific differences
in occupancy).
L47: Some explanation of what you mean by ‘spatial prioritisation’, similar to that at L384, would be
useful here.
L98: It may be useful here to summarise in a few words what the approach of Galvez et al. involves
(for readers unfamiliar with this area).
L107: suggest inserting ‘canid’ before ‘species’.
L124: lat/long would be useful.
L156: Is there any evidence that the focal species use (or avoid) roads/tracks? Direct sightings were
excluded to maintain uniformity in detection but if species differentially use roads/tracks this issue
would still arise.
L158: I’m impressed that enough scat and track signs could be unambiguously assigned to species. I
was going to suggest that a description of these signs and how you went about this would be useful
but I agree, the reference to Karanth et al. is adequate. It may however be useful to indicate the
body sizes of your study species and how similar/different their signs are. You could perhaps indicate
what proportion of records were discarded due to ambiguity in ID.

4
5 33 Many carnivore species inhabit human-dominated landscapes outside protected reserves.
6
7 34 Spatially explicit assessments of carnivore distributions and livestock depredation patterns in
8
9
35 human-use landscapes are crucial for minimising negative interactions and fostering coexistence
10 36 between people and predators. India harbors 23% of the world’s carnivore species that share
11
12 37 space with 1.3 billion people in ~2.3% of the global land area. We examined carnivore
13
14 38 distributions and human-carnivore interactions in a multi-use forest landscape in central India,
15
39 focusing on five sympatric carnivore species: Indian gray wolf Canis lupus pallipes, dhole Cuon
16
17 40 alpinus, Indian jackal C. aureus indicus, Indian fox Vulpes bengalensis and striped hyena
18
19 41 Hyaena hyaena. Carnivore occupancy varied from 12% for dholes to 86% for jackals, influenced
20
21 42 by forests, open scrublands, and terrain ruggedness. Livestock/poultry depredation probability in
22 43 the landscape ranged from 21% for dholes to >95% for jackals, influenced by land cover and
23
24 44 livestock- or poultry-holding. The five species also showed high spatial overlap with free-
25
26 45 ranging dogs, suggesting potential competitive interactions and disease-risks, with consequences
27
46 for human health and safety. Our results provide insights on factors that facilitate and impede co-
28
29 47 ocurrence between people and predators. Spatial prioritisation of carnivore-rich areas and
30
31 48 conflict-prone locations could facilitate human-carnivore coexistence in shared habitats. The
32
33 49 framework we use is ideally suited for making socio-ecological assessments of human-carnivore
34 50 interactions in other multi-use landscapes and regions, worldwide.

45 56 1. Introduction
46
57 Global carnivore distributions have high overlaps with human-use landscapes [1]. Multi-use
47
48 58 heterogeneous landscapes can serve as important subsidiary habitats for supporting populations
49
50 59 of several carnivore species, and therefore offer great conservation potential [2]. Unfortunately,
51
52 60 most current conservation strategies are focused on protected reserve creation and management,
53 61 particularly in developing countries [3,4]. This is problematic because protected reserves in a
54
55 62 majority of countries cover only 4–11% of the land area [5]. Furthermore, the socio-cultural,

57
58

60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 3 of 34 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 63 financial, and political challenges that plague management of large carnivores in human-use
4
5 64 areas makes it difficult to formulate policies that ensure their conservation while also
6
7 65 safeguarding human lives, property, livelihoods, and well-being [6].
8
66
9
10 67 Spatial overlap between carnivore distributions and human-use areas increases human-predator
11
12 68 interface, resulting in negative interactions. Such scenarios are more common in developing
13
14 69 countries where people’s livelihoods are directly dependent on land and livestock [7]. People
15
70 depend on forests for wood and other non-timber products [8,9]. Multi-use forests may also serve
16
17 71 as grazing lands for domestic livestock [10]. On the other hand, carnivores foray into farmlands,
18
19 72 villages, and sometimes, even large cities [11], thereby creating contentious ‘shared spaces’
20
21 73 between people and predators. As a result, humans face livestock losses, threats to life, and
22 74 opportunity costs from avoiding areas with carnivore presence. Carnivores, in turn, face injury,
23
24 75 retaliatory killing or physical removal following livestock depredations or human attacks. In
25
26 76 many cases, people’s negative attitude towards carnivores is also from perceived threat rather
27
77 than actual losses [12, 13].
28
29 78
30
31 79 With global increase in human population and the consequent impacts on wildlife, anthropogenic
32
33 80 activities can potentially facilitate or impede carnivore persistence in shared spaces [7]. India
34 81 harbors around 23% of the world’s carnivore species in ~2.3% of the global land area. These
35
36 82 carnivores share space with a population of 1.3 billion people, where human densities average at
37
38 83 400 people per sq.km. Protected reserves constitute about 4% of the country, and roughly 19% of
39
40
84 the land area is under unprotected forest cover. Such forests, together with a multitude of non-
41 85 forest habitats (agroforests, scrublands, barrenlands, grasslands, etc.), harbor populations of large
42
43 86 carnivores outside the reserve network [14]. Wild canids, in particular, are a case in point.
44
45 87 Although the five species and three subspecies show widespread distribution across diverse
46
88 landscapes landscapes [15], few studies have undertaken ecological assessments or evaluated
47
48 89 their conservation requirements in shared habitats dominated by human activities. Given the
49
50 90 range of risks they face, and the potential for conflict between wild canids and humans, such
51
52 91 assessments could benefit both people and predators.

3 93 We examined factors that facilitate coexistence between humans and four symaptric wild canid
4
5 94 species (Indian gray wolf Canis lupus pallipes, dhole Cuon alpinus, Indian jackal Canis aureus
6
7 95 indicus, Indian fox Vulpes bengalensis) in the Kanha–Pench forest landscape of central India.
8
9
96 We also included the striped hyena Hyaena hyaena in our assessment because they have
10 97 somewhat similar ecological requirements. We adapted and expanded the framework proposed
11
12 98 by Gálvez et al. [16], formally integrating ecological and social dimensions of carnivore
13
14 99 conservation in human-dominated landscapes (figure 1). Based on our findings, we identify areas
15
100 that would warrant spatial prioritisation, and, provide management recommendations for
16
17 101 reducing wildlife-related losses to people while also conserving the carnivore community in this
18
19 102 landscape.

21 103
22 104 2. Materials and methods
23
24 105 2.1. Study framework
25
26 106 The framework we use follows four sequential steps (figure 1). In the first step, we identified
27
107 ecological attributes that would influence distribution of the five species. We built a candidate
28
29 108 set of models for each species based on a priori predictions. Analysis of field-based sign survey
30
31 109 data generated spatial probabilities of presence (distribution) for the five species. The second
32
33 110 step relates to the social dimension; data on carnivore presence, depredation events, and socio-
34 111 economic attributes of people in the landscape were collected through questionnaire-based
35
36 112 interview surveys of local residents (at the same spatial scale as the sign surveys). We tested the
37
38 113 influence of ecological variables, social factors, and species distribution (from the previous step)
39
40
114 on depredation patterns. Step 3 represents the outcomes from the first two steps and also allows
41 115 for incorporating ancillary information that would together contribute towards understanding
42
43 116 human-carnivore interactions. In our case, the ancillary data pertain to distribution of free-
44
45 117 ranging dogs. This step could also incorporate other factors that are not directly included in the
46
118 modelling process (e.g., mortality, harvest, tolerance levels, etc., as relevant to the context). The
47
48 119 final step (4) contains plausible inferences that could be drawn from all aspects that contribute
49
50 120 towards human-carnivore interactions. This may include management implications, policy
51
52 121 recommendations, spatial prioritisation, or refinement of methods/models used in steps 1–3.

3 124 The Kanha–Pench forest landscape extends over c.160 km between Kanha (940 sq.km) and
4
5 125 Pench (411 sq.km) Tiger Reserves in the southern part of the State of Madhya Pradesh, India
6
7 126 (figure 2). The ~10 000 sq.km landscape harbors dry deciduous forests interspersed with
8
9
127 grasslands, scrublands and agricultural lands. These habitats support populations of the five focal
10 128 carnivore species (hereafter referred to as wolf, dhole, jackal, fox, and hyena). The region
11
12 129 harbors other carnivores the like tiger Panthera tigris, leopard P. pardus and sloth bear Melursus
13
14 130 ursinus, along with a suite of large ungulate herbivores. The landscape has a large number of
15
131 human habitations, with over 400 villages including several ethnic tribes inhabiting the forest
16
17 132 interiors. Agriculture is the cornerstone of rural economy, but collection of non-timber forest
18
19 133 resources, small-scale mining, and wage labor in nearby towns supplement household incomes.
20
21 134
22 135 2.3. Survey Design
23
24 136 We overlaid a grid-network with 128 cells of 52 sq.km each across the landscape (figure 2). Each
25
26 137 cell was treated as an independent sampling unit. Cell-size was chosen based on ecological,
27
138 logistical and sampling considerations, that included home range sizes of the study species,
28
29 139 spatial coverage of the study area and adequate sample sizes. We used an occupancy-based
30
31 140 framework to assess distribution and depredation probabilities of the five species [13,17]. The
32
33 141 occupancy metric is sensitive to the spatial scale at which assessments are made [18,19]. Based
34 142 on the size of cells (henceforth ‘sites’) relative to the home range sizes of the five species, we
35
36 143 interpret the occupancy parameter (<U+03C8>) as ‘habitat-use probability’ for wolf and dhole (home
37
38 144 range sizes of the two species are >52 sq.km; see [20] for wolf; [21] for dhole). For jackal, fox,
39
40
145 and hyena, we interpret <U+03C8> as ‘true occupancy probability’ (home range sizes of the three species
41 146 are <52 sq.km; see [22] for jackal; [23] for fox; [24] for hyena).
42
43 147
44
45 148 2.4. Field surveys
46
149 We surveyed forest roads and trails for indirect signs of the five carnivores from October 2015 to
47
48 150 January 2016. Trained survey teams searched for scats and tracks of the focal species, following
49
50 151 field protocols described in [17]. Direct sightings of species were excluded from the analyses to
51
52 152 retain uniformity in the detection process. Detection/non-detection (1/0) data were recorded for
53 153 each species along contiguous 1-km trail segments; each segment was treated as a spatial
54
55 154 replicate. Walk effort ranged from 2 to 23 km per site, proportional to the forest cover in the
56

58
59 5

2
3 155 corresponding site. Although four of the five species occur in a range of habitat types, surveying
4
5 156 along forest roads/trails allowed us to maximise the probability of detecting their signs. Along
6
7 157 with data related to the five carnivore species, we also recorded signs of ungulate prey, livestock,
8
9
158 and free-ranging dogs. We considered only those signs that could be unambiguously identified to
10 159 avoid issues with false positive detections [25], and kept the survey duration short enough to
11
12 160 maintain uniform detection conditions [26].
13
14 161
15
162 Combining interview data with occupancy analyses is now commonplace for examining species
16
17 163 distributions over large areas [14,27,28]. We conducted questionnaire-based interview surveys of
18
19 164 local residents at the same spatial scale as the sign surveys, from September 2015 to January
20
21 165 2016. Villages and households were selected so as to ensure maximum spatial coverage within
22 166 each site, and respondents were shown four photographs of each focal species for identification.
23
24 167 Conditional on correct identification, surveyors recorded information regarding (a) species
25
26 168 presence in or near their village, and (b) depredation incident in their household or village,
27
169 attributed to one of the five species. Considering the recall period and accuracy of respondents in
28
29 170 such surveys [29], we only considered events pertaining to the previous 12 months. The number
30
31 171 of people interviewed per site ranged from 1–9, and each interview was treated as an
32
33 172 independent spatial replicate. In cases where respondents could not identify the species, the
34 173 interview was discarded and the replicate was considered as ‘non-surveyed’ for the purpose of
35
36 174 this analysis. We additionally recorded information on socio-economic status of the respondents,
37
38 175 land and livestock holdings, economic losses related to depredation, mitigation measures
39
40
176 employed and tolerance/acceptance of wildlife.

42
43 178 2.5. Analytical methods
44
45 179 2.5.1. Modelling carnivore distributions
46
180 We fit detection/non-detection data from sign surveys to single species occupancy models [30].
47
48 181 Since the surveys were conducted along contiguous trail segments, we used an extension of the
49
50 182 original model described in [31], which accounts for potential spatial correlation of sign
51
52 183 detections. We estimate two key parameters from these surveys: <U+03C8>– probability of species
53 184 presence in a site, and p– probability of detecting a species in a site, given presence. These two
54
55 185 parameters were modelled as functions of species-specific ecological covariates identified in the

2
3 186 study framework (table 1). In some cases (e.g., dhole), data were too sparse for fitting the
4
5 187 correlated-detections model, so we relied on the traditional single species model that assumes
6
7 188 independence of replicates ([30]; table S1).
8
189
9
10 190 2.5.2. Multi-state models to estimate depredation probability
11
12 191 We assessed patterns of depredation by the carnivores using multi-state occupancy models [32].
13
14 192 The detection matrix included ‘0’– non-detection of a carnivore species by respondent, ‘1’–
15
193 detection of carnivore presence but no depredation (state 1), and ‘2’– detection of carnivore-
16
17 194 related depredation event by the respondent (state 2). We estimate the following parameters: <U+03C8>p–
18
19 195 probability of species presence in a site (without depredation); <U+03C8>d– probability of depredation in
20
21 196 a site; ppp– probability of detecting species presence in a site; pdd– probability of detecting
22 197 depredation in a site; ppd– probability of detecting only presence although there may be
23
24 198 depredation in the site. To maintain parsimony and avoid issues with overfitting, we retained an
25
26 199 intercept-only effect for <U+03C8>p, and, used the number of interviews per site , i.e. survey effort, as a
27
200 covariate for detection parameters across all models (table S2). The main parameter of interest <U+03C8>d
28
29 201 was modelled as a function of ecological and social covariates relevant to each carnivore species
30
31 202 (table 2).
32
33 203
34
204 2.5.3. Dog occupancy and wild carnivore richness
35
36 205 Free-ranging dogs, indirectly facilitated by anthropogenic activities, pose threats to wild
37
38 206 carnivores through competition and spreading diseases [33]. Interactions between free-ranging
39
40
207 dogs and wild carnivores were assessed in three ways. First, we used frequency of dog signs in
41 208 each site as a covariate in modelling distributions of the wild carnivores (table 1). Second, we
42
43 209 estimated occupancy of dogs and compared its overlap with occupancy of each of the five wild
44
45 210 carnivores across 128 sites. Occupancy probability for dogs in the landscape was estimated using
46
211 the same methods as described above for wild carnivores. Livestock abundance, size of human
47
48 212 settlements and human population in each site were used as covariates to model dog occupancy
49
50 213 and detectability(see table S3 for model combinations and ranks). Third, we examined the
51
52 214 overlap between dog occupancy and an estimate of wild carnivore richness. Wild carnivore
53 215 richness for each site was calculated as:

17
18 222 3.1. Distribution and habitat-use
19
20
223 We invested a total of 1631 km of walk effort and detected wolf, dhole, jackal, fox, and hyena in
21 224 16, 4, 64, 23 and 9 sites, respectively. A single model did not fully explain the observed patterns
22
23 225 for any of the species. We therefore model-averaged across all candidate models to obtain
24
25 226 species-specific estimates of <U+03C8> and p. Parameter estimates for all species are presented in table 3.
26
227 Estimates ranged from probability of use for dhole at <U+03C8> (SE) = 0.12 (0.01) to probability of
27
28 228 occupancy for jackals at <U+03C8> (SE) = 0.86 (0.01). Forest cover and principal prey abundance were
29
30 229 positively associated with dhole presence. Scrublands were important for wolf, jackal, and

32 230 hyena. Terrain ruggedness influenced wolf and jackal presence, and, wolf and fox preferred drier
33 231 areas. Influence of livestock abundance was negative for dhole but positive for hyena. Frequency
34
35 232 of dog signs did not have a significant effect on the occupancy probability of wild carnivores

40 235 3.2. Depredation patterns and determinants
41
42 236 Depredation probability models were based on data from 675 interviews with local residents.
43
44 237 Depredation incidents were recorded from 68 sites for wolf, 9 sites for dhole, and 44 sites for
45 238 fox. There were no records of depredation by hyena, but incidents attributed to jackal were
46
47 239 reported in >95% of the sites. We could perform formal analyses only for wolf, dhole and fox.
48
49 240 Estimated depredation probability was highest for wolf and least for dhole (table 4; figure 4).
50
51
241 Depredation by dhole was associated with higher forest cover, lower livestock abundance, and
52 242 higher habitat-use probability (estimated in the previous step). Extent of scrublands, settlement
53
54 243 size, habitat-use probability, and goat-holding by local residents influenced depredation by wolf;

247 3.3. Overlap with free-ranging dogs
10 248 Dog signs were detected in 68 of 128 sites. We estimated dog occupancy probability at <U+03C8> (SE) =
11
12 249 0.84 (0.004), and detection probability at p (SE) = 0.32 (0.01); see figure 5. Dog occupancy was
13
14 250 positively influenced by size of human settlements [ß (SE) = 0.74 (0.68)] and detectability was
15
251 positively influenced by livestock abundance [ß (SE) = 0.37 (0.14)]. Human population size and
16
17 252 livestock abundance did not have a significant influence on dog occupancy (table S3).
18
19 253 Examining species-specific overlaps, dog occupancy was positively correlated with occupancy
20
21 254 of wolf, jackal, fox, and hyena (Pearson’s correlation r = 0.32, 0.42, 0.53, and 0.63,
22 255 respectively), and negatively with dhole (r = -0.73; figure 5). Wild carnivore richness ranged
23
24 256 from 1.38 to 3.41 per site, and these estimates showed a positive relationship with dog
25
26 257 occupancy (r = 0.45; figure 5).

28
29 259 4. Discussion
30
31 260 The enormous space constraints imposed by a burgeoning human population on wildlife and
32
33 261 wild habitats necessitates empirical studies that explore what factors facilitate or deter
34 262 coexistence between people and carnivores. Conservation biologists and wildlife managers are
35
36 263 increasingly recognising the importance of incorporating human dimensions with ecological
37
38 264 knowledge about carnivores to understand these interactions [36,37]. Our study explicitly
39
40
265 examined socio-ecological contexts within which a suite of under-studied carnivores co-occur
41 266 with people at a spatial scale relevant to regional and national level policy implications.
42
43 267
44
45 268 4.1. Consolidating habitats for carnivores
46
269 Dholes typically require intact forests with relatively high wild prey densities and low livestock
47
48 270 grazing pressure [19,38]. The Kanha–Pench forest landscape is a potential sink habitat for
49
50 271 dholes, linking the two reserves which host source populations [39]. Forests constitute more than
51
52 272 80% of the habitats in our study area, yet dholes used only 12% of the sites. Concomitant
53 273 impacts of livestock grazing [40,41], fragmentation of forests [42] and recent infrastructural
54
55 274 developments in the region [43] could severely paralyse connectivity for dholes in the landscape.

3 275 Scrublands were important for wolf, jackal, and hyena presence. Preserving scrublands entails a
4
5 276 host of complexities unlike the case with forests. This is reflected in the gross under-
6
7 277 representation of grasslands and scrublands in terrestrial protected reserves across the world [44].
8
9
278 In India, the problem is twofold; (1) scrublands are treated as unproductive ‘wastelands’,
10 279 converted into agricultural areas, or, diverted for commercial use [45], and (2) most scrublands
11
12 280 are revenue lands that are not managed by the forest department. Even when such lands are
13
14 281 brought under the department’s jurisdiction, they are subverted for highly unscientific and
15
282 oftentimes counter-productive afforestation initiatives. Agricultural lands may serve as
16
17 283 supplementary habitats for wolf, jackal, fox, and hyena, but our results in this aspect were
18
19 284 inconclusive (but see 14,20,23,24). We submit that our estimates do not reflect the true
20
21 285 contribution of agricultural lands as habitats, and this could be an artefact of the spatial scale and
22 286 location of our sampling units.
23
24 287
25
26 288 4.2. Depredation risks in shared landscapes
27
289 Livestock depredation is a key factor that can deter human-carnivore coexistence [46].
28
29 290 Mitigating livestock depredation by carnivores, and, evaluation of preemptive or redressal
30
31 291 actions towards losses have received much academic and conservation focus [47,48].
32
33 292 Understanding the spatial risk factors determining depredation incidents is an important tool in
34 293 carnivore management and conservation. Our approach (1) relied on records of depredation
35
36 294 events self-reported by people, (2) treated ‘depredation’ as a probabilistic state of carnivore
37
38 295 presence (sensu 15), (3) accounted for potential biases of unequal survey effort or under-
39
40
296 reporting/non-detection of depredation records, and (4) allowed for explaining observed patterns
41 297 through a combination of ecological and social attributes of the system. Based on this, we were
42
43 298 able to ascertain a probability of depredation risk for each site.
44
45 299
46
300 We classify dhole and hyena as ‘low conflict-risk’ species in our study landscape. Dholes
47
48 301 avoided areas with high livestock movement, and, probability of dhole presence-only (without
49
50 302 depredation) was the highest among three species (<U+03C8>p= 53%). Depredations by dholes are likely
51
52 303 from incidental attacks, when cattle are grazed inside forests. Similar trends of low human-dhole
53 304 conflict have been reported from the Western Ghats [49], but not in Northeast India [50] or
54
55 305 southeast Asia [51]; a potential explanation is that dholes do not attack livestock if there is

2
3 306 adequate availability of wild prey. We did not record any reports of depredation by hyenas. This
4
5 307 may corroborate observations that hyenas are scavengers and do not actively hunt domestic prey
6
7 308 [52]. Based on our results, we classify wolf, jackal, and fox as ‘high conflict-risk’ species.
8
9
309 Wolves mostly preyed on goats, and depredation was higher in sites with large scrubland areas
10 310 and small settlements. As predicted, goat depredation by wolf was also higher in sites with
11
12 311 bigger goat-holdings (number of owned goats in our study area ranged from 1–30 per
13
14 312 household). Jackals generally attacked poultry; jackal-related events were reported by
15
313 respondents in >95% of the sites, precluding us from conducting formal analysis to estimate
16
17 314 depredation probability. Poultry depredation by foxes, on the other hand, was skewed towards
18
19 315 sites with smaller settlements and high poultry-holdings. Our results are similar to those reported
20
21 316 by Karanth et al. [53], who found that wolf and jackal were responsible for most depredation-
22 317 related losses in a part of the same landscape.
23
24 318
25
26 319 4.3. Mitigation strategies and compensatory solutions
27
320 The efficacy of mitigation measures to avoid depredation, and the financial investments towards
28
29 321 these efforts have been a subject of considerable debate. In a recent review, Eklund et al. [54]
30
31 322 show that most interventions for mitigating human-carnivore conflicts globally have been futile,
32
33 323 and argue for evidence-based measures to reduce losses. Within our study area, people used
34 324 rudimentary fencing structures, moved animals into secured sheds during night time, kept watch
35
36 325 dogs, or, maintained fires at night to prevent depredation of livestock. In contrast, poultry were
37
38 326 generally free-ranging and kept indoors/in baskets at night. Frequent depredation events also
39
40
327 coerced some people into completely giving up livestock ownership. The Government of India
41 328 mandates compensation administered through the State forest departments for depredation-
42
43 329 related losses, with compensation amount varying across States and based on the type of
44
45 330 livestock (Karanth et al., in review). In the State of Madhya Pradesh (our study location), for
46
331 example, the current policy compensates loss of cattle (~250–460 USD depending on age and
47
48 332 quality) and goats (~46 USD), but not poultry. Respondents generally refrained from claiming
49
50 333 compensation for goats because it is nearly impossible to establish proof of depredation by wild
51
52 334 canids. Furthermore, a few cases of crop-loss were also associated with canids (e.g., maize and
53 335 tuber consumption by jackal and fox), but compensation for such losses do not feature in the
54
55 336 current policy.

3 337
4
5 338 State-provisioned monetary compensation is among the most widely used mitigation measures
6
7 339 for livestock losses [55]. Monetary compensation initiatives have the potential to alter people’s
8
9
340 tolerance and acceptance of carnivores [56]. However, flawed implementation makes it an
10 341 ineffective strategy, particularly in the case of wild canids. Although improvement in husbandry
11
12 342 practices—more secure shelters and better herding practices—could reduce depredation rates
13
14 343 [57], we believe that decentralised, village-level insurance schemes need to be explored as
15
344 alternative strategies (e.g., [58]). We note however, that respondents in our study were generally
16
17 345 indifferent towards losses to wild canids, often viewing depredation incidents as inevitable
18
19 346 occupational hazards. Such non-negative attitudes may also be attributed to the fact that wild
20
21 347 canids in this region do not attack, injure, or kill humans (in contrast to tigers or leopards).
22 348 Nonetheless, we do recognise that we lacked the requisite expertise for making qualitative, in-
23
24 349 depth evaluations of human attitudes and perceptions.
25
26 350
27
28
351 4.4. Latent threats from free-ranging dogs
29 352 Free-ranging dogs are currently the most widespread large carnivore species in the world [59].
30
31 353 With populations persisting largely due to anthropogenic resource-provisioning, dogs can bear a
32
33 354 host of negative impacts on wildlife, domestic livestock, and human health. Besides their
34 355 competitive dominance, they also act as reservoirs of lethal diseases, which pose serious threats
35
36 356 to wildlife populations [60]. Studies examining dog-wildlife interactions have rightly cautioned
37
38 357 about the range of associated risks, substantiating the global efforts invested towards vaccination
39
40
358 and sterilisation of dogs [33]. The urban, semi-rural, and rural landscapes of India support large
41 359 populations of free-ranging dogs [61]. In our study, dog occupancy was correlated with larger
42
43 360 settlements, perhaps because of high resource provisioning in the form of garbage dumps or
44
45 361 voluntary feeding in such sites [62]. Dogs showed high overlap with overall wild carnivore
46
362 richness. Examining these overlaps with individual species, only dholes tended to avoid areas
47
48 363 with high dog occupancy (figure 5). Of particular interest is the high overlap between dogs and
49
50 364 the other four species. Negative interactions between dogs and wild carnivores typically
51
52 365 manifests through interference competition at fine spatial scales [63]. Although there is high
53 366 overlap at the scale of our sample units, the wild carnivores stand to lose out on many
54
55 367 microhabitats within regions where they co-occur with dogs, effectively reducing the total

2
3 368 available habitat for wild carnivores. With nearly no predator-imposed control, and, very few
4
5 369 factors deterring their survival in human-dominated landscapes, dog populations are likely to
6
7 370 grow exponentially in the future. Controlling populations of unowned dogs in the country has
8
9
371 thus far been unsuccessful, and is often at crossroads with opposing ideologies meted out by
10 372 advocates of animal rights and welfare groups [64]. We foresee this as a serious concern for
11
12 373 survival and persistence of carnivore populations (and their wild prey species) in our study
13
14 374 region and similar landscapes across the country.
15
375
16
17 376 4.5. Implications for conservation
18
19 377 The current focus and investment towards large-scale infrastructure development in the Kanha–
20
21 378 Pench forest landscape renders carnivore conservation in a ‘triage’ scenario [65]. There is also
22 379 considerable ease with which public lands—including forests—are currently being diverted for
23
24 380 commercial use and infrastructure development. Based on our findings, we propose that (1)
25
26 381 ardent efforts be directed towards retaining the current land cover structure, configuration, and
27
382 heterogeneity to conserve this carnivore community at the regional scale, as well as planning
28
29 383 infrastructure projects and developmental activities so as to facilitate persistence of the five
30
31 384 species; (2) our predictions of spatial depredation patterns be utilised for conservation
32
33 385 prioritisation [66] and systematically identifying locations for investment of funds for conflict
34 386 resolution; and (3) active control and management of free-ranging dog populations would benefit
35
36 387 both, humans and wild carnivores. Carnivores provide several direct and indirect benefits to
37
38 388 human health and well-being [67]. Considering the high proportion of rodents in the diet of two
39
40
389 mesocarnivores in our study (jackal and fox), they may also provide economic benefits through
41 390 pest control (e.g., [68]). But formulating national policy frameworks for conserving predators
42
43 391 whose global ranges are large but nonetheless face local extinctions can be a formidable
44
45 392 challenge. As a consequence, governments currently do not recognise the ecological implications
46
393 of conserving these carnivores. Other than the dhole, all other species in our study are
47
48 394 categorised under Near Threatened or Least Concern in the IUCN Red List. But the consortium
49
50 395 of habitats they represent are much more fragile than intact forest reserves. We therefore argue
51
52 396 for a shift in perspective from the current single-species/wilderness focus to a multi-pronged
53 397 approach that balances human well-being while also conserving a community of carnivores in
54
55 398 shared landscapes [2,69]. Our approach of combining social and ecological dimensions therefore

have received the feedback from four reviewers. All reviewers agreed that this is an
resting study, but one reviewer points out some substantive problems, questioning the
ustness of the models and the inferences than can be drawn from them. If the authors can
ress the concerns and suggestion from the reviewers, I would welcome a resubmission of the
nuscript to RSOS.
ponse: Thank you very much. We really appreciate the constructive and positive
ments provided by the four reviewers. We have addressed each comment in this
ument and revised the manuscript accordingly. We have also provided justifications or
rifications as relevant. Our responses are in boldface font and the reviewer comments are

mments to the Author(s)
s is a well written manuscript on an important topic for global carnivore conservation. The
hors use an interesting approach incorporating both wildlife ecology and human dimensions to
erstand habitat use by canids, and relate that back to human-wildlife conflicts, before making
rences on habitat conservation/protected area expansion in a working landscape in India.
ponse: Thank you very much.
wever, I have major concerns about the results of this study that undermine the findings. For
wild canid occupancy modeling effort, the 95% confidence intervals around the beta estimates
all of the covariates for each species include 0. Moreover, the standard errors are larger than
beta estimates in many cases. This is a clear indication that the results are poor, at best, and
inferences based on these results may be spurious.
ponse: We agree. The 95% CI for all covariates do straddle 0. We would like to assert,
wever, that in large mammal occupancy assessments across large landscapes (particularly
en covariates are z-transformed) very few studies are able to show statistically conclusive
uence of predictor variables (i.e., 95% CI of beta-coefficients do not overlap 0). Like most
er studies of similar nature, our results are indicative of the direction of effect. We do
nowledge that in cases where SE is greater than the mean, there is very little support for
covariate. Our inferences therefore do not apply to any covariate where the SE is larger
n the mean for the corresponding regression coefficient.
thermore, the authors indicate on line 225 in the text that covariate-specific estimates of
ection and occupancy probabilities are model averaged estimates. However, the caption for
le 4 indicates that the estimates are from the model in which a covariate first appears. Model
raged estimates would be most appropriate to report, given the model selection uncertainty
t is present in most cases.
ponse: We follow model-averaging methods as described in Burnham and Anderson
02) to obtain final estimates of the key parameters (<U+03A8> and <U+03A8>d). Given the range of issues
h model-averaging individual regression coefficients (sensu Cade 2015; Banner and Higgs
7; Dormann et al. 2018), we have refrained from doing so. The caption for Table 4 is
rect in its current form. No change made.
estimates of site-level richness are calculated from the species-specific occupancy modeling
rt, and these results are not acceptable from a
ponse: This comment was not complete so we are not fully sure of what the reviewer
ends to convey. Nevertheless, we agree that the richness value is not based on the most
al method, although the approach we use has been applied in other studies (e.g., see
ranth 2011 Current Science; Calabrese et al. 2014 Global Ecology and Biogeography;
oder et al. 2018 Plos One). There are several recent studies that propose better methods
stimating species richness using an occupancy framework. We were constrained to using
“index of richness” because of the models we used for separately estimating habitat use
depredation, which are ideally suited for the corresponding objectives. We have revised
text and now refer to ‘richness’ as ‘richness index’.
ed on the model-selection tables for feral dog occupancy, the constant model has at least equal
lanatory power as the next best model explaining occupancy for this species, which is human
lement. The authors do not address this in the text, and any estimates of predicted feral dog
upancy should be model averaged estimates. It is not clear in the text if model averaged
mates are reported, and the 95% confidence interval for the reported beta estimate for the
uence of human settlements on feral dog occupancy includes 0.
ponse: Feral dog occupancy estimate is based on model-averaging the <U+03C8> parameter. The
espread presence of feral dogs is likely the reason for weak covariate support. We have
ed this explanation in the revised manuscript.
ed on the results of the Depredation Patterns and Determinants occupancy modeling effort,
is the strongest attribute of the manuscript. If the editors decide to invite revisions to the
nuscript, the revised manuscript should be based solely on this modeling effort.
ponse: Thank you for recognizing this aspect. We agree that the strength of our paper

essments of human-carnivore interactions in other regions and landscapes.

s paper employs a relatively novel approach, combining ecological and social data to identify
ors that facilitate and impede coexistence between humans and four wild canid species in
ia, and in turn, provide refreshingly practical suggestions for canid conservation. I think that
is a high-quality piece of research and my comments are very minor. I am however
ualified to critique the statistical approach used and recommend that a reviewer with
erience in this type of analysis be consulted.
ponse: Thank you very much. It is very encouraging to read positive comments from
iewers and we are glad you find our paper interesting and valuable for wild canid
servation.
or revisions
: It would be useful to mention the survey method used. Also, it is unclear here whether you
an that occupancy of both dholes and jackals was influenced by habitat type, or that the
iation in occupancy between dholes and jackals is due to habitat type (rather than interspecific
erences in occupancy).
ponse: We mention dhole and jackal to represent the range of estimates (low to high), to
intain brevity and adherence to the word limit. We have rephrased this sentence for
ter clarity.
: Some explanation of what you mean by ‘spatial prioritisation’, similar to that at L384, would
useful here.
ponse: We have provided an explanation in the Discussion section but retained the
stract text as is to adhere to journal word limits.
: It may be useful here to summarise in a few words what the approach of Galvez et al.
olves (for readers unfamiliar with this area).
ponse: We have provided a brief explanation of the Galvez et al. approach in the revised
nuscript.
7: suggest inserting ‘canid’ before ‘species’.
ponse: We have inserted ‘carnivore’ instead of ‘canid’ because the striped hyena is not a
id.
4: lat/long would be useful.
ponse: We have now included Lat/Long of the study location.
6: Is there any evidence that the focal species use (or avoid) roads/tracks? Direct sightings
e excluded to maintain uniformity in detection but if species differentially use roads/tracks this
e would still arise.
ponse: We know that dholes use forest roads/trails based on available literature. The
pling design we use here has not been implemented in studies of the other four species.
relied on field knowledge and logistical feasibility to optimize detections of these four
cies.
8: I’m impressed that enough scat and track signs could be unambiguously assigned to
cies. I was going to suggest that a description of these signs and how you went about this
uld be useful but I agree, the reference to Karanth et al. is adequate. It may however be useful
ndicate the body sizes of your study species and how similar/different their signs are. You
ld perhaps indicate what proportion of records were discarded due to ambiguity in ID.
ponse: We have included body sizes (weights) of the focal species in the revised
nuscript. None of the records were discarded post-hoc. When signs could not be
mbiguously attributed to a particular species, we refrained from recording this
ormation in the field. So, we do not have a number/proportion of records that were
carded. We only recorded detections that could be reliably (to the best of our ability)
igned to a particular species.

nuscript title: A socio-ecological framework for examining human-carnivore interactions:
mpatric wild canids in India as case study
s manuscript examines the relationship between carnivore distribution and patterns of livestock
redation in multi-use heterogeneous landscapes. The authors build upon an occupancy
deling framework combined with structured interviews towards village residents, to assess the
acts of carnivore depredation on husbandry activities and how environmental and social
ors help explain interaction patterns and to map conflict-prone areas. The manuscript is well
tten, for which I applaud the authors, the language is clear, and sections are well structured.
mpling design is robust and occupancy models seem to have been properly fitted. Both
upancy and detection parameters seem to have been carefully thought. However, dealing with
e issues must preclude publication, such as the translation of results into insights to land-use
icy, strategies for conflict mitigation or conservation of shared landscapes (step 4 of the study
mework). Some details on methods need to be clarified, to allow reproducibility, even if the
plete dataset is available (as is the case in this manuscript). Overall, this is a good manuscript
I would like to see published, once the concerns I present are resolved.
ponse: Thank you very much.
cific issues:
e: The title suggests that the authors are originally describing a new method, in a
hodological paper on the use of this innovative socio-ecological framework, which is not the
e. As far as I understood, the authors build upon an existing method, to evaluate a biological
stion with conservation-related purposes.
ponse: Thank you for pointing this out. We have restructured the title such that it better
ects the main theme of our study.
stract:
L46-47: Which results? Which conclusions?
ponse: We have rephrased this sentence.
oduction:
L93: “We examined factors that facilitate coexistence…” This phrase should be re-written,
ause, as it is, it indicates factors the prevent conflict. If this is not what you mean by it, please
write.
ponse: Here, our aim was to convey that although there are certain factors that
ermine patterns of depredation, the focal species do coexist alongside people. This
tains to habitats or land-cover types that are conducive to carnivores inhabiting human-
minated areas. Massive land-use changes or land conversions will be detrimental to
sistence of these carnivores. The current landscape matrix and associated ecological
ributes are thus important factors facilitating human-carnivore coexistence. We
iberate on these aspects in the Discussion section.
L100: The use of “, and,” with two commas should be avoided throughout the text.
terials and methods:
ponse: Revised as suggested, throughout the manuscript.
0: The use of semicolon in this phrase should be checked.
ponse: We have removed the semicolon and revised these sentences.
ure 1
p 1: Please check the arrow that combines Ecological requirements <U+F0E0> Integrated multi-state
upancy models: if the ecological/environmental predictors have already been used during the
gle-species occupancy modeling phase, then the outcome of such models (the carnivore
ribution) should not be included in another model (multi-state occupancy models) in addition
he ecological/environmental predictors once again. This double incorporation will result in
rfitted models, due to correlation (spatial or environmental) among predictors, and spurious
tionships among environmental/ecological predictors and carnivore occupancy. If this is not
case (environmental predictors have not been included twice), please check the text and clarify
section.
ponse: There are some covariates that were predicted to influence distribution/habitat-
but also likely to influence depredation patterns, and therefore used in both steps. We
cked for cross-correlations before running the models and refrained from using highly
related predictors (r > |0.7|) in the same model (to avoid issues of over-fitting models and
lti-collinearity among predictor variables).
p 3: If carnivore distribution is an input of integrated multi-state occupancy models, shouldn’t
e presented in box 2?
ponse: Step 3 includes results from model predictions. Carnivore distributions are also
nd-alone results and are included in Step 3. We have used these estimates as potential
dictors in modelling depredation patterns, and thus an arrow feeds back from Step 3 to
p 2.
ld survey section
d to read this section a couple of times to understand that single-season and multi-state
upancy models had not been calibrated with the same data (scat signs or interviews). Please
ify this section, explicitly indicating which data belong to which modelling framework. In
ition, I suggest the elaboration of another figure, in a conceptual or workflow scheme, to allow
er understanding of methods and procedures, especially because there are several and different
delling steps, which use and require different data inputs.
ponse: The sign-based surveys were conducted to examine distribution patterns and the
erview surveys for depredation patterns. These are described in two separate paragraphs.
have retained these as two paragraphs and edited the text to make it more explicit in the
ised manuscript.
g occupancy and wild carnivore richness
del selection procedures were not explained. How did authors evaluate and select among top-
king models? A table of species-specific models, showing covariates combinations, could be

cific model comparisons showing covariate combinations are in the Supplementary
terial (Tables S1, S2 and S3).

ponse: We chose to present results in the current format for brevity and to avoid
undancy (which would be the case if we presented the results species-wise). For better
rity, we have now included key parameter estimates for all species in the Results section.
- L238: Hyenas are notorious by their necrophagous behavior, so I wonder why the authors
uded it as a target species in a paper on the factors that contribute to human-carnivore
flict… If the scavenger behavior of hyenas is notorious and unambiguous, was there some
ication, maybe personal experience in the field observing hyenas predating livestock or poultry,
would justify the inclusion of such species? If there was not, I believe that the a priori
ectation of a relationship is not reasonable and that the species should be removed.
ponse: Information on hyena-human interactions in India is severely inadequate in
blished literature. Therefore, we included hyena as one of the focal species in this study.
ne of the survey respondents reported depredation by hyenas, confirming speculations
de in previous studies, that hyenas are, in fact, largely scavengers and do not directly
y on livestock.
L253-257: The lack of relationship between carnivore richness and dog occupancy, in addition
he species avoidance/congruence in space, is an interesting result, that was overlooked in the
cussion section.
ponse: We have alluded to this result in the Discussion sub-section 4.4. “Latent threats
m free-ranging dogs”, and discussed species-specific overlaps thereafter.

L268-272: The authors argue that dhole occupancy was low, even though “forests constitute
re that 80% of the habitats” in the study area, but I wonder what the occupancy of dholes on
ct forests is. If dholes are generally rare, even on preserved habitat, there is no reason to expect
high occupancy on any landscape.
ponse: Habitat-use probability by dholes in forest habitats is not necessarily low. For
mple, Srivathsa et al. (2014) reported an occupancy estimate of 0.71 for dholes in
ndipur National Park, southern India. Based on anecdotal information and field
wledge, we know that there are dhole populations in Kanha and Pench reserves. We
ected that our study area– which links the two reserves– would be used by dholes to
ve between the reserves. Our results indicate that dholes used these areas with very low
bability.
L365-368: The discussion on separation into micro-habitats is speculative, because the
hors do not present evidence (results or literature) that overlap at landscape scale may result in
itat differentiation in more local scales.
ponse: We agree that this is a speculation based on current knowledge of dog-wildlife
eractions. Most of the papers cited in this paragraph provide evidence in favour of our
m.
L300-305: Nonetheless, dhole occupancy was overall low, and hyenas are not expected to
y on animal husbandry (or are they?).
ponse: These two species share space with humans but are responsible for very little/no
mage to livestock. We have accordingly classified them as “low conflict-risk” species.
L378: Please explain the “triage” scenario.
ponse: The triage here refers to the previous line and links to the rest of the paragraph.
e government of India’s current agenda of rapid infrastructure development puts non-
tected wildlife-rich habitats at risk. The triage scenario arises when promoting necessary
nomic development while also trying to ensure conservation of wildlife and wild habitats

erall, maybe it would be better to avoid excessive adjectives, such as ardent (L381), formidable

3: Authors introduce here data on livestock husbandry, which was not presented/analyzed in
ults.
ponse: We have modelled livestock-holding by household as a covariate while modelling
redation patterns. Please refer to Table 1. If the reviewer is referring specifically to
bandry practices, kindly note that analysing mitigation measures adopted by local
munities and evaluating the efficacy of these measures was beyond the scope of this
dy.
3: Explain why it is impossible and what? Is it impossible to distinguish depredation of
erent canid species?
ponse: Depredation by carnivores like tigers and leopards are conspicuous. The track
rks, drag marks etc. may be identified easily. In many instances, the livestock carcass is
fully consumed, and bite marks on the carcass can be used for ascertaining carnivore
ntity. All these aspects are examined by the Forest Department during field visits before
ing compensation. Wild canid signs cannot be easily identified if personnel are not
ined to do so (which is usually the case). Wild canids rarely leave carcasses behind nor do
y cache them and return to consume the same. These factors make it difficult to
rospectively establish proof of livestock attack and attribute it to specific canid species.

3: Using a Pearson’s correlation here doesn’t make any sense. The authors modeled wild
nivore occupancy as a function of dog occupancy, and any relationships between the two
uld be predicted from those models.
ponse: We used encounter frequency of dog signs to model carnivore occupancy. The
ct was weak and inconclusive. The Pearson’s correlation here is between dog occupancy
imated separately) and carnivore occupancy.
6: Feral dogs are responsible for a great deal of depredations in the US, where their numbers
much lower than those reported in this study. How do we know that losses attributed to
kals and wolves are not actually caused by dogs, and then potentially scavenged by the wild
ids?
ponse: We were very cautious while recording information related to depredation by
d canids. Respondents were asked to describe the events in as much detail as possible, and
vey teams were trained to recognize/identify species behavior and traits. We readily
counted species attribution by respondents if we thought there was even the slightest
biguity in species description or details of the depredation event.
4: This is in stark contrast to stakeholder perceptions of livestock depredation by wild canids
he US. even in areas with no large carnivores that pose a threat to humans.
ponse: We agree. There are some studies that delve deeper into human acceptance of
ge carnivores in shared landscapes of India. As we openly acknowledge in the manuscript,
did not have the expertise to perform detailed analysis of human perceptions and
tudes in this study.
les 4 and 5: 95% CI around all beta coefficients includes 0. Moreover, the SE is larger than
coefficient in many cases. Likely don’t have enough data for robust inference from these

ponse to reviewer comments
have split the reviewer’s comment into parts and answered each part separately for better
ity.
viewer #1:
authors have disregarded my major concerns with their interpretation of results, therefore, I
recommend major revisions or rejection. In their response, the authors state that studies of
ge carnivore occupancy rarely produce statistically significant results, particularly when
ariates are Z-transformed prior to analysis. This is simply not the case. Moreover, Z-
nsformation of covariates usually increases the performance of Occupancy models, and lowers
values..
ponse: Thank you very much for your comments. We sincerely apologize that our
vious response was not acceptable to you. We have tried our best to explain our stance
re clearly in the response below.
for model averaging of beta estimates for individual covariates, see Grueber et al. 2011,
rnal of Evolutionary Biology
ponse: We studied the Grueber et al. 2011 paper and its plausible relevance to our study.
ile their approach to multi-model inference has merit, our overall philosophy aligns more
sely with Cade (2015; Ecology), which takes into account the nested nature of covariate
dels, low to moderate multicollinearity of predictors (as is the case in our study) and the
t that we model-average across all models (rather than only the top models or only across
dels where a given predictor is present). We respectfully disagree with the reviewer about
del-averaging regression co-efficients.
ile I agree that betas with an SE including 0 can indicate the direction of a relationship, there
o much uncertainty in the estimates presented in tables 4 & 5 that even the direction of the
tionship is in question. On the extreme end, how can the direction of a relationship be
ermined with a confidence interval of -1.02 - 1.1 (wolf/agri; table 4) be interpreted? In their
ments, the authors agree that there is very little support for a covariate when the SE is larger
n the beta estimate for that covariate. Why are those covariates still included in the tables,
n? At a bare minimum, please remove those estimates from the tables. I.E., sambar,
iculture, and dogs, should not be included as a covariate for any of the models in Table 4. The
del for wolf should not include livestock, the model for jackal should not include forest cover,
model for fox should not include scrub or ruggedness, and the model for hyena should only
ude livestock. The same standards should be applied to the models presented in table 5. New
dictions will need to be made from models not containing the covariates that need to be
oved, and the results and discussion should be modified to reflect all of the above changes.
ponse: For each species, we made a set of a priori predictions (based on our knowledge of
ir ecology and the landscape) and confronted these with data. Some predictors (and
dels) had better support compared to the others. There was of course a set of predictors
which the effect was completely inconclusive. In Tables 4 and 5 we have presented the
a-estimates for ALL predictors from the model where they first appear, irrespective of
ether they received adequate support or not. Removing these would imply that we are
y presenting results that corroborate our predictions, and this would be incorrect. We
e presented the list of candidate models for all species- for distribution and depredation-
he Supplementary Information. We are sure you will agree that re-running models based
post hoc observations of regression results would qualify as dredging.
reiterate that in the Results section (and subsequently in the Discussion), we have only
erred from and deliberated on those covariates whose SE is lower than the mean of the
responding predictor variable. But we agree that this was not articulated clearly in the
vious version of the MS. We have therefore revised the text in the Results section to
licitly acknowledge the uncertainty around covariate effects.
