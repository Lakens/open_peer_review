The manuscript entitled: "Identification of potent chromone embedded [1,2,3]-triazoles as novel
antitubercular agents” describes the anti-mycobacterial activities of Notoamide enantiomers of a
series of 20 novel chromone embedded [1,2,3]-triazol derivatives. The compound 6s is the most
potent compound in vitro with a MIC value of 1.56 µg/mL. Molecular Docking result shows that
compound 6s is more effective against the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase of Mtb.
The comments and questions below should be taken into account.
1. More biology experiments were expected to be done to verify the mechanism of interaction
between substrates and target.
2. More data had better to be shown to clarify the correlation between GLIDE score binding
energy and in vitro anti-tubercular activity.
3.Minor corrections:
Page 2, line 18 replace “triazoles” with “triazol”
Page 2, line 20 replace “exhibits” with “exhibit”
Page 5, line 23 replace “Binding” with “binding”

The present work describes the synthesis of 20 new compounds with chromone and lipophilic
fragments are connected with triazole linker. Some of the compound have shown high
antituberculous activity together with low cytotoxicity. Molecular docking has shown that
molecules of 6 are able to inhibit enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase of M.tuberculosis H37Rv.

Overall, the work is conducted on a high scientific level and the results obtained are of interest to
the pharmaceutical chemistry. Thus, the manuscript can be published in Royal Society Open
Science.
The manuscript contains several misprints and inaccuracies. In addition, I have a question and a
suggestion to the authors, which are given below.
Questions and remarks
1. I would advise to add the following review on biological properties of 1,2,3-triazoles into the
references: De Carvalho da Silva, F.; do Carmo Cardoso, M. F.; Ferreira, P. G.; Ferreira, V. F. In
Topics in Heterocyclic Chemistry, Dehaen, W.; Bakulev, V. A. Eds.; Springer-Verlag: Berlin,
Heidelberg, 2015, vol. 40, p. 117.
2. Figure 3c) shows us that lipophilic fragment of molecule 6s is connected to Asp64 through the
H-bond between acid and OH-group of 6s, which is not observed in other compounds 6.
However, this is not being discussed. Maybe this is the reason for increased bioactivity of 6s?
3. Instead of "enoyl acyl" should be "enoyl-acyl".
4. 13C spectrum of 6a is missing one signal.

form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so

Response to the reviewers (Manuscript ID: RSOS-171750)
iewer 1:
manuscript entitled: "Identification of potent chromone embedded [1,2,3]-triazoles as novel
tubercular agents” describes the anti-mycobacterial activities of Notoamide enantiomers of a series of
novel chromone embedded [1,2,3]-triazol derivatives. The compound 6s is the most potent compound
itro with a MIC value of 1.56 µg/mL. Molecular Docking result shows that compound 6s is more
ctive against the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase of Mtb.
mment 1: More biology experiments were expected to be done to verify the mechanism of interaction
ween substrates and target.
ponse: Thank you for the reviewer’s suggestion. Presently, we don’t have the infrastructure at our
itute to carry out biology experiments in detail to verify the mechanism of action. Certainly, studies
orted here would encourage researchers to perform relevant biological studies.
mment 2: More data had better to be shown to clarify the correlation between GLIDE score binding
rgy and in vitro anti-tubercular activity.
ponse: This is a very insightful comment by the referee. In response to his comments, we incorporated
correlation plot of antitubercular activity against GLIDE score (Supporting information).
mment 3: Minor corrections:
e 2, line 18 replace “triazoles” with “triazol”
e 2, line 20 replace “exhibits” with “exhibit”
e 5, line 23 replace “Binding” with “binding”.
ponse: As suggested, all the corrections has been appropriately incorporated in the revised manuscript.
iewer 2:
present work describes the synthesis of 20 new compounds with chromone and lipophilic fragments
connected with triazole linker. Some of the compound have shown high antituberculous activity
ether with low cytotoxicity. Molecular docking has shown that molecules of 6 are able to inhibit
yl-acyl carrier protein reductase of M.tuberculosis H37Rv. Overall, the work is conducted on a high
ntific level and the results obtained are of interest to the pharmaceutical chemistry. Thus, the
uscript can be published in Royal Society Open Science. The manuscript contains several misprints
inaccuracies. In addition, I have a question and a suggestion to the authors, which are given below.
mment 1: I would advise to add the following review on biological properties of 1,2,3-triazoles into the
rences: De Carvalho da Silva, F.; do Carmo Cardoso, M. F.; Ferreira, P. G.; Ferreira, V. F. In Topics
eterocyclic Chemistry, Dehaen, W.; Bakulev, V. A. Eds.; Springer-Verlag: Berlin, Heidelberg, 2015,
40, p. 117.
ponse: As suggested, the above review article has been cited in the revised manuscript (References;
rence 9a)
mment 2: Figure 3c) shows us that lipophilic fragment of molecule 6s is connected to Asp64 through
H-bond between acid and OH-group of 6s, which is not observed in other compounds 6. However,
is not being discussed. Maybe this is the reason for increased bioactivity of 6s?
ponse: We also agree with reviewer’s observation that the H-bonding of –OH of compound 6s and
-64 of the target may be attributed to the enhanced bioactivity of the molecule.
mment 3: Instead of "enoyl acyl" should be "enoyl-acyl".
ponse: Correction has been made in the revised manuscript.
mment 4: 13C spectrum of 6a is missing one signal.
ponse: In fact, one of the carbon signal of 6a has been merged and appeared at d 118.4 (CH,
rbons). The required change has been made in the manuscript (Experimental section, Characterization
of compound 6a)
