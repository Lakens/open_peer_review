My only comment to this paper is that I do not see how detection of cryptic species does help
with environmental management, aside from the fact that one may consider diversity a value in
itself (which I personally do, but decision makers may not). From my own experience with
governmental agencies I tghink it may be very difficult to get across the value of species one can
not even tell apart by looking at them. From a different angle: does the presence of many cryptic
species indicate a higfher resilience of a community? I think you might want to get a little bit
deeper into this if you want to sell your methodology to environmental and other agencies.

DNA barcoding uncovers cryptic diversity in 50% of deep-sea Antarctic polychaetes
Reviewer’s comments
A/ General appraisal:
The manuscript contains valuable information on the discrepancy between morphological and
molecular species determination and related issues with diversity estimates and cryptic diversity.
As for several other benthic invertebrates, cryptic speciation in polychaetes seems to be a frequent
phenomenon and hampers our correct estimation of faunal distribution patterns. The manuscript
is well written, relevant and contains crucial information if we are to fully understand Antarctic
3
deep-sea diversity. I have only small comments on a few details, and therefore suggest minor
revision. Below I have listed my recommendations per section, page and line number. As a more
general comment, I was wondering why no other markers were used to confirm/refute the
results obtained here from mitochondrial DNA (e.g., nuclear 18S or ITS sequences). I am aware of
the fact that these are generally less variable (although ITS can be almost as variable as COI in
some benthic taxa), but they can provide additional clues to speciation patterns from unlinked
loci.
B/ Specific comments:
Abstract
P.2, line 28: “normalisation to on expected...” – delete one of the prepositions
P.2, line 31: “its role of in” – delete ‘of’
Introduction
P.2, line 40: “... if species are unable adapt to...” – add ‘to’ between unable and adapt
P.2, line 43: “... accurately document and assess our understanding of current species diversity...”
– I would delete ‘our understanding of’.
P.4, line 88: the reference (Thornhill et al., 2008) for nematodes is actually dealing with Nemertea,
not Nematoda. I suggest changing this. To my knowledge, there are no published records of
cryptic nematode species in Antarctic waters, although there are several reports from other
habitats (mainly shallow and intertidal – publications by e.g., Dr. Sofie Derycke).
Methods
P.5, line 129: “comprising of” – I always thought it is either ‘being comprised of’ or ‘comprising’
without the preposition, but maybe I am mistaken.
P.6, lines 147-149: I would split this sentence into two, because now it does not read very fluently.
P.6, line 150: I suggest a comma between ‘individuals’ and ‘target’ to improve the flow of the
sentence.
P.7, line 179: I don’t understand why Table 2 is mentioned in this sentence – delete.
P.7, line 201: misspelling of ‘nucleotide’
replace by its corresponding number.
P.8, line 213: cite Mesquite and add to references? “Maddison, W. P. and D.R. Maddison. 2016.
Mesquite: a modular system for evolutionary analysis. Version 3.10 http://mesquiteproject.org”
P.8, line 219: for consistency reasons (e.g., line 111 – re-evaluate) I would use a hyphen for
reexamined.
Results
P.9, lines 254-255: Why do you mention Aglaophamus trissophyllus and Hesionidae sp. A
already here? According to the previous paragraph, they belong to scenario 2 (evidence only in
COI phylogeny).
P.9, line 256 and 261: place Table and Figure references in brackets?
P.9, line 266: dot missing in species name E. cirratoformis.
P.10, line 277: table reference in brackets.
P.10, lines 277-281: it would be nice to have an overview of the K2P pairwise distances between
species, and between species clades (e.g., table in supplementary information?). Like this, it will
be possible for the reader to determine to what extent clades differ from one another. Now there
is only Table 2 which lists whether cryptic speciation is evident or not and how many sequences
were obtained per species/species clade.
P.10, line 280-281: “... ranged from 10-15%, these were considered...”. Something is missing here.
Either you start the sentence by saying “Because interspecific differences were 10-15%, these were
4
considered cryptic species.” Or you leave the first part untouched and then rephrase the second
part to “ranged from 10-15%, so these were considered...”.
P.10, lines 281-284: you never mention the third 16S clade (Aglaophamus sp. (MB4) in Table 2).
What about that one? Also, line 284, Figure 6 between brackets?
P.10, lines 289 and 292: in your figure legends you use “labelled” while here “labeled”. Which one
is it?
P.10, line 292: “... and they are labelled Hesionidae sp. (MB).”
P.10, line 299-300: see previous comments about table and figure references.
P.11, line 303-305: I would use ‘consider them as cryptic species’ since you’ve used ‘deem’ twice
in this sentence.
P.11, line 313: again, it would be nice to have an overview of these K2P distances.
P.11, lines 314-317: split this sentence, or change the punctuation marks
P.11, line 318-
rate of COI, it is not beyond possibility that if this gene was obtained, greater variation would
have been recorded.”
P.11, line 323: see previous comment on publically vs. publicly.
P.11, line 327: “It confirmed the presence of Harmothoe fuligineum and Aglaophamus
trissophyllus.” What do you mean exactly? Did the comparison with GenBank confirm this?
Presence where? In the Antarctic? Please clarify this sentence a bit.
P.12, lines 334-336: split into two sentences: “This questions the usefulness of its subspecies
status. If the subspecies are...distinct to and located... from its parent species, we query
whether...”
Discussion
P.13, line 368: “These results indicate/show...” rather than “highlight”.
P.13, line 373: “... f
– omit ‘enough’
P.13, line 377: “to conserve the Southern Ocean as a fragile marine environment.”
P.13, line 378: “growing number of genetic datasets”?
P.13, lines 379-381: “As previously stated, cryptic diversity has now been documented [...],
however [...] investigate a single genus or species.”
P.13, lines 381-384: split into two sentences (after holothurian morphospecies). Suggestion for
second sentence (to improve flow): “Within this study, an average of three divergent lineages was
uncovered in 17 of the 28 targeted morphospecies, thereby significantly increasing species
richness.”
P.13, line 387: remove “also”
P.13, line 397: “With the exception of a few chemosynthetic species...”.
P.14, line 400-401: place brackets around “e.g. whether species are brooders of spawners, if they
have larval stages and whether these are feeding or non-feeding”.
P.14, line 402: “studies based on shallow water species.”?
P.14, lines 416-418: split into two sentences; e.g. “Genetic evidence for cosmopolitan polychaete
species does exist. For example, the tube worm...”
P.14, line 424: add comma after ‘studies’ to improve sentence clarity
P.14, lines 426-441: I do not really see the link between the first sentence and the rest of this
paragraph. The transition between them is not very logical to me. Agreed, we should increase our
knowledge on why cryptic species are important and how they differ in ecological preference or
tolerance. But in what way do your results say something about this? The experimental examples
that you refer to are interesting, but can be shortened. Can you rephrase this paragraph to make it
a bit more to the point?

P.15, lines 448-453: split sentences and rephrase. E.g.: “For example, the soft bodies of polychaetes
can be easily damaged during sample processing. The resulting presence of incomplete
specimens, especially those that have lost critical identifying features, reduces the accuracy of
species identification [65]. An example of the latter in this study was found in Aricidea where the
median antenna present on Aricidea simplex (distinguishing it from A. belgicae) was detached in
some cases leading to false identification prior to DNA sequencing.”
P.15, line 458: “the EBS used to collect specimens targets smaller individuals”
P.15, line 459: misspelling of ‘morphospecies’
P.15, line 464: simplify sentence “DNA barcoding should be considered a complimentary method
of species identification”
P.15-16, lines 465-468: this sentence does not read fluently to me. Rephrase if possible.
P.16, line 470: ‘complimentary’ is not the right adjective here. I would use ‘complementary’ or
‘congruent’. Also, better to write “between the two mitochondrial genes” since no reference was
made in the previous paragraph to the genes used.
P.16, lines 475-476: rephrase “Furthermore, within family-level polychaete studies, the retrieval
of...”
P.16, lines 488-
P.16, line 493: move comma to after references
P.16, line 494: start new sentence at “However, other factors remain to be investigated, [...]”

behalf of all the authors of ‘DNA barcoding uncovers cryptic diversity in 50% of deep-sea
tarctic polychaetes’ I would like to thank you for accepting our manuscript for publication with
nor corrections.
l grammatical and structural corrections suggested by each reviewer have been edited accordingly.
ditional references have also be cited where appropriate. Specific responses to reviewers are
luded below. The more major corrections and comments that have been altered include:
• A table in the supplementary information of the K2P distances between morphospecies,
cryptic species and clades. This will allow a reader to determine to what extent clades differ
from one another in more detail than the current figures allow.
• We have re-emphasised the link between the importance of our results and future
investigations into the functionality of cryptic species as well as the importance of accurate
biodiversity estimates for marine management.
ponses to each of the reviewer’s comments.

y only comment to this paper is that I do not see how detection of cryptic species does help with
vironmental management, aside from the fact that one may consider diversity a value in itself
hich I personally do, but decision makers may not).”
ntences regarding the need for accurate biodiversity estimates for effective marine management
ve been retained. We regard these data to be fundamental to understanding marine ecosystems and
ould be baseline data for management practices. Their question regarding whether the presence of
ptic species indicates higher resilience of a community or not is something we will be addressing
our future work investigating the functional traits of cryptic species. This is why we introduce
nctional studies and potential impacts on ecosystem function within our discussion.
ost of the minor grammatical comments were consistent with those of reviewer 2 and have been

response to why we did not use other genetic markers, we did sequence nuclear markers, including
S and 28S of some individuals; however these did not assist in identifying the presence of cryptic
ecies. ITS was not used as a genetic marker because, although we agree it could have assisted in
identification of some cryptic and non-cryptic species, for the majority of families and genera
estigated publically available sequences for comparison were more limited and our identification
s based on between species comparisons. Furthermore the funding did not all for additional PCR
sequencing costs.
would be nice to have an overview of the K2P pairwise distances between species, and between
ecies clades (e.g., table in supplementary information?)”
table of all K2P distances between morphospecies, cryptic species and clades within cryptic
ecies was added to the supplementary information. This will allow the reader to determine to, what
tent clades differ from one another in more detail than the current figures allow.

e thank the reviewer for the additional comments received after manuscript acceptance. Most of
grammatical changes and structural changes were amended in the above corrections suggested by
iewer 2. Additional citations were added where suggested, including Kvist (2014), Puillandre et
(2012) and Riesgo et al. (2015) and Sicinski (2011). Further comments are discussed below.
viewer suggested that Figure 2 should be moved to the supplementary material.
ure 2 has not been moved to the supplementary material as the morphological characters shown in
specimen photos are of relevance when discussing species identification. To avoid confusion we
ve not altered the figure legend, at the figures point of reference in the manuscript the cryptic
ecies are yet to be identified and the purpose of the figure is to present the targeted morphospecies
ected.
viewer questions why we did not use the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) to identify
ptic species.
e did not use the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) as we think that analysing both the
P comparisons and phylogenetic trees of our sequenced specimens and others within the same
mily provides equal if not more information for species discrimination. If we had used the ABGD
del we would have still have had to make the same decisions as to what level of intraspecific and
erspecific variation is used to determine species for which, as documented, there is no universal
t-off.
viewer asks why the biogeography of each cryptic species is not discussed.
e biogeography of the cryptic species was not included in this manuscript as it is not within the
ope of our current study. The primary aim was to investigate the level of cryptic diversity in
tarctic polychaetes across multiple families, which is yet to be documented within the literature.
e feel that the increase in biodiversity by 233% resulting from DNA barcoding uncovering cryptic
ecies and additional morphospecies is significant enough to publish prior to our future work. These
jects will use our DNA data as a foundation to investigate the biogeographic patterns of cryptic
ecies combining genetic and model data as well as functional analysis.
viewer requested that all phylogenetic trees to be included in the supplementary material and that
re detailed phylogenetic descriptions were provided for each species within the results section.
t all phylogenetic trees were submitted as this would have amounted to an additional 16 figures
d each would have followed one of the three scenarios described. We also hope that the K2P
ues displayed in Figure and Tables 2 and S1 would emphasize this.
this for each family would greatly change the length and focus of the manuscript. Although we
e phylogenies to determine species numbers, we want to maintain focus on the overall outcome
her than family specific phylogenetic patterns. We have also not discussed the presence of cryptic
ecies within GenBank sequences e.g. Scalibregma inflatum as we do not have access to these
ecimens and thus cannot re-examine the morphology nor is it within the scope of the study.
viewer asked for GenBank comparisons to be discussed as each species is discussed within its
en scenario.
e have kept the results sectioning the same, we did not disperse the GenBank comparisons by
ecies as we feel this disrupts the flow of these results and removes focus from explaining the three
narios.
viewer asks whether any morphological differences between cryptic species were found.
e did not find any morphological differences between the specimens defined as cryptic species
ng our methods, however there may be differences in internal characteristics, which were not
alysed. Sentences regarding morphological taxonomy, including re-examination and the inherent
blems of identifying large numbers of specimens such as this, have not been removed. Traditional
onomic methods are becoming increasingly overlooked with increased DNA taxonomy and lack
expertise and we wish to express that this is still an important part of biodiversity work. Finally,
wish to re-emphasize that the increase in species number by 233% was a result of both cryptic
ecies and additional morphological species, thus the total increase is not solely a result of cryptic
ersity. We have not estimated total species diversity within the original dataset containing 20,000
ecimens, as the presence of cryptic species was not consistent across families.
urs sincerely,
