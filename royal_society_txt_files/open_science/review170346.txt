I have some sympathy with the general sentiment expressed in this comment. I am much more
familiar with bird social systems than with mammals and it is not uncommon to see in review
that datasets used in comparative analyses do not completely reflect current knowledge; it is
particularly frustrating when such analyses make it into print without correction. The extent to
which data weaknesses affect outcomes will vary according to any number of factors, but in
principle of course, data sets should be as complete as possible. On that general point, this
comment makes an effective case, even though it is targeted at a specific instance. I am not
sufficiently familiar with the mammalian literature to assess the merits of the dataset as a whole,
but Table 1 makes a compelling case regarding the Eulipotyphla.
The other main issue raised by the author is the suggestion that journal editors seek expert taxon-
specific advice on the dataset subjected to comparative analysis. In practice, this is likely to be
problematic. First, a similar case could be made for routine reviewing by specialists in all aspects
of a paper (e.g. taxonomic, methodological, statistical, etc). Second, for large datasets, such as that
analysed by Jetz and colleagues (cited here), it would be a formidable task to check the sources of
all data, phylogenetic relationships, etc., and even with smaller comparative datasets, data are
often drawn from obscure sources that are not readily consulted.
Overall, although the comment focuses on a specific study and the recommendations about the
review process may not necessarily be practical, the general point that data compilation for
comparative analyses should be rigorous and transparent is a valid one.
Specific comments

P3, 59-60 – ‘the current study.’ is ambiguous, so this needs a citation.
P4, 64 – ‘where non-breeding…’
P4, 70-78 – I think it could be argued with some validity that there is a place for inference of some
trait (social or otherwise) under certain circumstances. For example, Cockburn (2006; Proc R Soc B
273:1375-1383) used phylogenetic inference in assessing the prevalence of different modes of
parental care in birds, and in this case it could be justified by the fact that (a) knowledge of the
social organisation of bird species is much better than that of mammals, and (b) phylogeny of
birds is also much better resolved than that of mammals. However, I agree that potential
problems arise when inferring a social trait for an entire taxonomic group on the basis of a small
proportion of described species.

In his comment, Schradin claims that the results of our comparative analysis showing that
cooperative breeding is more likely to evolve in mammals living in arid habitats are invalid
because he believes that we have misclassified some shrews as solitary instead of pair-living.
Schradin appears to not have checked the definitions of the categories used in our dataset and
our analysis. As we describe, we only categorise species as social where most females live in
stable groups that include several adult females that breed regularly and share all of their range;
as socially monogamous if the majority of breeding females share a home-range for more than
one year with one male, but no other conspecific breeders; and as cooperative breeders if non-
breeding individuals provide alloparental support to dominant breeders (Lukas and Clutton-
Brock 2013 Supplementary Material pp.2-3) (see footnote).
Our categorisation of shrews follows these definitions. Shrews are traditionally regarded as
living alone or with dependent offspring (Churchfield 1990 The natural history of shrews. Cornell
University Press; Krushinska et al. 1994 Acta Theriol. 39, pp.227–247, Rychlik and Zwolak 2006
Can J Zool, 84, pp.434-448) and there is no evidence that any species are social according to our
definition of sociality. A recent review of their social organisation using a broader definition of
pair-living than ours suggests that six species may be pair-living and speculates that this may be
more widespread than is currently realised (Valomy et al. 2015 Biology Letters, 11, p.20150825).
However, none of the studies of ‘pair living’ species that the review cited provided evidence of
the formation of stable pairs remaining together for more than one year. As there is some doubt
that these shrew species fall within our definition of pair-living, we treated them as solitary in
our analysis.
Schradin’s suggestion that our categorisation of shrews invalidates the results of our analysis is
unreasonable. Our paper explores the distribution of transitions to cooperative breeding from
pair-living. As our paper describes, our results show that the evolution of cooperative breeding
involving alloparental care by non-breeders is associated with habitats where annual rainfall is
low. Shrews do not tend to occur in arid habitats, and since there is no indication that any shrews
are cooperative breeders our decision of removing a small number of species from our analyses
by not classifying them as monogamous is conservative. To remove any possible doubt, we have
4
re-run our analysis re-classifying the four shrew species suggested to be pair-forming by
Schradin and the association between cooperative breeding and aridity is unaffected.
As Schradin points out, an association between cooperative breeding and aridity has been
previously suggested for mole-rats – but this is the first time that a general association across
mammals has been demonstrated. The additional findings we present in our manuscript,
including that aridity is linked to litter-size and particularly influences alloparental care when
home-ranges contain non-breeding individuals, and that cooperative breeders occupy more
habitats than all other mammals, are not affected by how these species of shrew are classified.
FOOTNOTE
Quantitative comparative studies need to use clear definitions that are suited to the questions
they are asking (Kappeler 2014 TREE 29, pp.591-593). The definition of sociality used in our
analysis is intended to differentiate between species where breeding females are intolerant of
each other but associate with dependent young for part of the year and those where breeding
groups include several females that breed regularly. Our definition of social monogamy is
intended to distinguish between species where individual males associate temporarily with
receptive females but there are no long-lasting pair-bonds that persist across years and species
where individual males and individual females form long-lasting bonded pairs; and our
definition of cooperative breeding was intended to distinguish between species where several
breeding females share care of their offspring (communal breeders) and species where young are
provisioned and guarded by non-breeders (cooperative breeders). While we accept that these
definitions are more specific than those used by some other classifications of mammalian social
organisation, we believe that they are well suited to answering the questions we investigate.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
One of the primary interests for evolutionary biologists is to describe the evolutionary drivers for
a particular trait. Detailed studies of single species can help to establish this, but there is always
the anxiety that the particular species may be ‘peculiar’ in some way, and that there is a need to
look at multiple species to arrive at generalities. So there is a real value to conduct comparative
5
studies. However, as made clear by this commentary – comparative studies need to set a high
standard. They are extracting data from the literature, but that data needs to be of high quality.
Schradin has convinced us that Lukas&Clutton-Brock2017OpenScience do not reach the standard
that should be expected and therefore this commentary is justified.
Schradin is particularly justified to make this commentary because he has already made a
criticism of the dataset in Lukas&Clutton-Brock2013Science which is used again in
Lukas&Clutton-Brock2017OpenScience. Schradin’s criticism was explicit and full and published
in one of the Royal Society journals (Valomyetal.2015BiologyLetters). Lukas&Clutton-
Brock2017OpenScience completely disregard this criticism.
Regarding Schradin’s commentary, it needs to be reworded. It needs a better organisation and
should be more focused/more concise.
The order of topics should be:
1) A general statement about the value of a comparative approach, but making the point
that it is really critical that high standards are set.
2) Make a brief statement that Lukas&Clutton-Brock2017OpenScience makes use of
previously published datasets on social monogamy (Lukas&Clutton-Brock2013Science) and
cooperative breeding (Lukas&Clutton-Brock2012ProcRSoc) and that there are flaws in both.
3) Make a detailed description of the shortcomings of the Lukas&Clutton-Brock2013Science
data on social monogamy – pointing out that these flaws have already been criticised in
Valomyetal.2015BiologyLetters. The Table 1 that Schradin includes in the commentary should be
included as part of this description, but Suncus etruscus should be included in that table.
4) The much briefer criticism of the cooperative breeding data should also be made,
pointing out that this criticism is made for the first time.
5) Conclude with text saying that the hypothesis put forward in Lukas&Clutton-
Brock2017OpenScience may well be correct, but it needs to be tested with data that has been
better checked. Finish by saying that there is a strong need for funding to support primary
studies of the sort that would be valuable for a comparative studies such as Lukas&Clutton-
Brock2017OpenScience.
Once the text has been ordered in this way, it will be possible to review the commentary in fine

label_comment_5
This commentary has been improved after the review process and, except for a long list of
important but small corrections, it is ready for publication. The author is justified to point out the
short-comings of the data sourcing for the Lukas & Clutton-Brock paper and makes points that
are of general relevance.
There are several aspects that need attention:
I don’t like the reference to ‘referees’ on the first page. Better is to say that the authors of the
paper need to be careful in carrying out their comparative studies
I think there are errors in the numbered citations – the author should carefully check ALL their
numbered citations. There are other respects in which this paper feels ‘rushed’. The author
should be very careful not to have errors – this paper is criticizing another paper for errors, and
that message would be rather undermined if the paper has errors of its own. Also, the quality of
the writing is poor in places.
Specific comments:
Line 19 – 25: replace ‘very rare … comparative studies.’ by ‘very rare, meaning that it is easy for
errors to creep into such databases.’
Line 28: replace ‘been recently shown’ by ‘already been shown’
Line 30: replace ‘superficial’ by ‘inadequate’
Line 33: replace ‘form’ by ‘from’
Line 34: replace ‘for Soricomorpha’ by ‘for the Soricomorpha’
12
Line 35: replace ‘the largest clade within Eulipotyphla’ but ‘the largest within the Eulipotyphyla’
Line 40: is reference [8] the correct one here? Here and below on the same page reference [8] is
cited but it doesn’t seem to be correct reference.
Line 48: replace ‘were’ by ‘have been’
Line 49: replace ‘357’ by ‘355’
Line 60: replace ‘used definition’ by ‘definition used’
Line 61: replace ‘staid’ by ‘stayed’
Line 66: replace ‘this’ by ‘these’
Line 67: replace ‘has different’ by ‘has a different’
Lines 68-72: replace ‘a subsample … would’ by ‘a subset of species than for other, longer lived
species. Thus, short-lived species like shrews would’
Line 76: replace ‘breeds only for one’ by ‘typically lives for only one’
Line 93: replace ‘even’ by ‘unqualified’
Line 97: replace ‘addressed’ by ‘pointed out’

Line 101: replace ‘the claims of their studies’ by ‘their central findings’
Lines 101-102: replace ‘I propose … database.’ by ‘I suggest that future comparative studies
should not make such massive assumptions about species characteristics based on such a small
founding dataset.’

Line 106: replace ‘used data’ by ‘data used’

The revised manuscript has been seen by one of the previous 'independent' referees (with the
second independent referee having been previously satisfied with the revisions) as well as the
authors of the original manuscript that is being commented on.
The 'independent' referee has a list of minor corrections that should all be acted upon, whilst the
authors of the original manuscript have more substantive criticisms. Given the nature of
commentary pieces then it is up to the author of this commentary to decide to what extent he
incorporates revisions to the text to accommodate points made by the original authors, keeping in
mind that these original authors should be given the opportunity to respond to the commentary
piece.

Comments to the Author(s)
This commentary has been improved after the review process and, except for a long list of
important but small corrections, it is ready for publication. The author is justified to point out the
short-comings of the data sourcing for the Lukas & Clutton-Brock paper and makes points that
are of general relevance.
There are several aspects that need attention:
I don’t like the reference to ‘referees’ on the first page. Better is to say that the authors of the
paper need to be careful in carrying out their comparative studies
I think there are errors in the numbered citations – the author should carefully check ALL their
numbered citations. There are other respects in which this paper feels ‘rushed’. The author
should be very careful not to have errors – this paper is criticizing another paper for errors, and
that message would be rather undermined if the paper has errors of its own. Also, the quality of
the writing is poor in places.
Specific comments:
Line 19 – 25: replace ‘very rare … comparative studies.’ by ‘very rare, meaning that it is easy for
errors to creep into such databases.’
Line 28: replace ‘been recently shown’ by ‘already been shown’
Line 30: replace ‘superficial’ by ‘inadequate’

Line 33: replace ‘form’ by ‘from’
Line 34: replace ‘for Soricomorpha’ by ‘for the Soricomorpha’
Line 35: replace ‘the largest clade within Eulipotyphla’ but ‘the largest within the Eulipotyphyla’
Line 40: is reference [8] the correct one here? Here and below on the same page reference [8] is
cited but it doesn’t seem to be correct reference.
Line 48: replace ‘were’ by ‘have been’
Line 49: replace ‘357’ by ‘355’
Line 60: replace ‘used definition’ by ‘definition used’
Line 61: replace ‘staid’ by ‘stayed’
Line 66: replace ‘this’ by ‘these’
Line 67: replace ‘has different’ by ‘has a different’
Lines 68-72: replace ‘a subsample … would’ by ‘a subset of species than for other, longer lived
species. Thus, short-lived species like shrews would’
Line 76: replace ‘breeds only for one’ by ‘typically lives for only one’
Line 93: replace ‘even’ by ‘unqualified’
Line 97: replace ‘addressed’ by ‘pointed out’
Line 100: replace ‘doesn’t’ by ‘does not’
Line 101: replace ‘the claims of their studies’ by ‘their central findings’
Lines 101-102: replace ‘I propose … database.’ by ‘I suggest that future comparative studies
should not make such massive assumptions about species characteristics based on such a small
founding dataset.’
Line 104: replace ‘The’ by ‘However, the’
Line 106: replace ‘used data’ by ‘data used’
Line 111: replace ‘sum’ by ‘summary’
Line 112-113: replace ‘and more … studied in’ by ‘and this requires many more species to be
studied carefully in’

Comments to the Author(s)
Carsten Schradin I have some sympathy with the general sentiment expressed in this comment. I am much
more familiar with bird social systems than with mammals and it is not uncommon to see in
T. (33) 03 88 10 69 19
review that datasets used in comparative analyses do not completely reflect current
F. (33) 03 88 10 74 56
knowledge; it is particularly frustrating when such analyses make it into print without
carsten.schradin@iphc.cnrs.fr
correction. The extent to which data weaknesses affect outcomes will vary according to any
number of factors, but in principle of course, data sets should be as complete as possible. On
that general point, this comment makes an effective case, even though it is targeted at a
specific instance. I am not sufficiently familiar with the mammalian literature to assess the
merits of the dataset as a whole, but Table 1 makes a compelling case regarding the
Eulipotyphla.
The other main issue raised by the author is the suggestion that journal editors seek expert
taxon-specific advice on the dataset subjected to comparative analysis. In practice, this is
likely to be problematic. First, a similar case could be made for routine reviewing by
specialists in all aspects of a paper (e.g. taxonomic, methodological, statistical, etc). Second,
for large datasets, such as that analysed by Jetz and colleagues (cited here), it would be a
formidable task to check the sources of all data, phylogenetic relationships, etc., and even
with smaller comparative datasets, data are often drawn from obscure sources that are not
Sous la co-tutelle de readily consulted.
>The referee is right that referees should be chosen in a way that they can evaluate all
aspects of a study, including how data were collected, quality of the data, statistical analysis,
and the importance of the questions asked in the study. As such, referees must always be
specialists.
I did not intend to suggest that all data should be checked. However, not checking any data
at all indicates poor review. (As a side comment: there are many other problems in several
other mammalian taxa of the database by Lukas; in my commentary I only refer to the ones
that are published). The editor of Royal Open Scicence suggested that this is asking too much
from the normal referees and the editor. If that is the case, then specialized
referees should be considered.
I rephrased this part of the manuscript to:
“ Referees should review the part of the database for which they do have
specialized knowledge and not just take the high quality of a database as granted.
In some cases, studies with large databases could benefit from one additional
referee that only focusses on the database itself, just as the views of specialized
referees are often sought on aspects of statistical analysis or of animal ethics”
www.iphc.cnrs.fr
DEPARTEMENT Overall, although the comment focuses on a specific study and the
ECOLOGIE, PHYSIOLOGIE

recommendations about the review process may not necessarily be practical, the
general point that data compilation for comparative analyses should be rigorous

different modes of parental care in birds, and in this case it could be justified by the fact that
(a) knowledge of the social organisation of bird species is much better than that of
mammals, and (b) phylogeny of birds is also much better resolved than that of mammals.
However, I agree that potential problems arise when inferring a social trait for an entire
taxonomic group on the basis of a small proportion of described species.

Comments to the Author(s)
In his comment, Schradin claims that the results of our comparative analysis
showing that cooperative breeding is more likely to evolve in mammals living in
arid habitats are invalid because he believes that we have misclassified some
shrews as solitary instead of pair-living.
>This is incorrect. I claim that the following paper cannot be used to classify
www.iphc.cnrs.fr hundreds of species as solitary and that these species should not be included in a
DEPARTEMENT database on social organisation, as their data represents assumptions, not real

data, (these species were not studied).

Schradin appears to not have checked the definitions of the categories used in our dataset
and our analysis. As we describe, we only categorise species as social where most females
live in stable groups that include several adult females that breed regularly and share all of
their range; as socially monogamous if the majority of breeding females share a home-range
for more than one year with one male, but no other conspecific breeders; and as
cooperative breeders if non-breeding individuals provide alloparental support to dominant
Carsten Schradin breeders (Lukas and Clutton-Brock 2013 Supplementary Material pp.2-3) (see footnote).
>This specific definition, after which all species which have an average adult lifespan <1 year
T. (33) 03 88 10 69 19 are by definition solitary (not monogamous with or without helpers; not group-living), does
F. (33) 03 88 10 74 56 not resolve the problem. I included now in the commentary:
carsten.schradin@iphc.cnrs.fr “The reason for the discrepancy in categorising a species as monogamous or not might be
differences in the used definition. Valomy et al. (2015) categorised all species where adults
typically lived in pairs as monogamous, independent of the duration for which pairs staid
together. Lukas & Clutton-Brock only classified species as monogamous when an adult pair
shared a home range for at least 1 year (electronic supplement of [5]). As Eulipotyphla
typically do not live as adults for more than 1 year [10, 11], this could explain why none of
them were regarded as monogamous, but all as solitary. However, several problems remain:
1. If an adult average life-expectancy of less than 1 year excludes for this species (by
definition) another form of social categorization than "solitary", then "solitary" has different
meaning in such a subsample than in subsamples that could potentially be categorized into
different social categories (in these species the call cannot vary). If such species are retained
in statistical analyses, structural missing categories lead to structural zeros. Inferences would
therefore be invalid, for biased parameter estimates, as well as incoherent meaning of the
social categories [12]. Thus, these species would have to be excluded from the database,
Sous la co-tutelle de because they cannot be reliably categorised. 2. They categorise one of the smallest
mammals, the Etruscan shrew Suncus etruscus, as monogamous. While under artificial
conditions in captivity this species can live more than 3 years, both in the field and in
captivity this species breeds only for one breeding season of six (field) or 7.5 (captivity)
months [11]. Thus, considering their definition, they wrongly classified the Etruscan shrew as
monogamous. 3. They categorize several species of the genera Microtus and Peromyscus as
socially monogamous. With this they follow the classical categorization for these species [13,
14], but not their own classification. There is no reason to assume that in these species more
than 50% of pairs live together for more than one year under natural conditions, as for these
rodents average adult lifespan in nature is typically less than one year [15, 16]
(and for their definition both pair partners would have to survive for more than
one year). In fact, “virtually no animal (=vole, inserted by CS) that breeds in one
year is alive the next” [15]. For example in the monogamous prairie vole Microtus
ochrogaster, mean survival rate is only 65 days [17] and adult individuals survive
only for approximately 8 weeks after their first capture [18]. Thus, if one uses the
definition by Lukas & Clutton-Brock, the species of these three genera cannot be
classified (as monogamous) due to their short life expectancy.”
www.iphc.cnrs.fr
DEPARTEMENT Our categorisation of shrews follows these definitions. Shrews are traditionally
ECOLOGIE, PHYSIOLOGIE
ET ETHOLOGIE
regarded as living alone or with dependent offspring (Churchfield 1990 The natural
history of shrews. Cornell University Press; Krushinska et al. 1994 Acta Theriol. 39,
23 rue Becquerel pp.227–247, Rychlik and Zwolak 2006 Can J Zool, 84, pp.434-448) and there is no
F-67087 Strasbourg Cedex 2
UMR 7178 evidence that any species are social according to our definition of sociality.
>The problem is that for hundreds of species there is no data available about their
social organization. If a traditional point of view is wrong then it should be
corrected (Valomy et al. 2015).
A recent review of their social organisation using a broader definition of pair-living than ours
suggests that six species may be pair-living and speculates that this may be more widespread
than is currently realised (Valomy et al. 2015 Biology Letters, 11, p.20150825). However,
none of the studies of ‘pair living’ species that the review cited provided evidence of the
Carsten Schradin formation of stable pairs remaining together for more than one year. As there is some doubt
that these shrew species fall within our definition of pair-living, we treated them as solitary
T. (33) 03 88 10 69 19 in our analysis.
F. (33) 03 88 10 74 56 >If there is doubt, then data must be excluded.
carsten.schradin@iphc.cnrs.fr As outlined above, these species should have been excluded from analysis because: 1. For
most of these species no real data are available. 2. For the few species for which data are
available, monogamous living cannot occur due to the used definition, and as such must be
excluded from statistical analysis, for which used cells must have the possibility to vary.
Schradin’s suggestion that our categorisation of shrews invalidates the results of our analysis
is unreasonable. Our paper explores the distribution of transitions to cooperative breeding
from pair-living. As our paper describes, our results show that the evolution of cooperative
breeding involving alloparental care by non-breeders is associated with habitats where
annual rainfall is low. Shrews do not tend to occur in arid habitats, and since there is no
indication that any shrews are cooperative breeders our decision of removing a small
number of species from our analyses by not classifying them as monogamous is
conservative. To remove any possible doubt, we have re-run our analysis re-classifying the
four shrew species suggested to be pair-forming by Schradin and the association between
cooperative breeding and aridity is unaffected.
Sous la co-tutelle de
>The main point is that all species for which no data exist must be excluded from the
database. One cannot assume data for a database. Further, they must change their
definition of monogamy or exclude all species with a mean adult lifespan of less than 1 year
under natural conditions from their database.
As Schradin points out, an association between cooperative breeding and aridity has
been previously suggested for mole-rats – but this is the first time that a general
association across mammals has been demonstrated. The additional findings we
present in our manuscript, including that aridity is linked to litter-size and
particularly influences alloparental care when home-ranges contain non-breeding
individuals, and that cooperative breeders occupy more habitats than all other
mammals, are not affected by how these species of shrew are classified.
>I state now:” My criticism doesn’t make a statement whether or not the claims of
their studies are correct. I propose that future comparative studies should not
include assumptions into their database.”
www.iphc.cnrs.fr FOOTNOTE
DEPARTEMENT Quantitative comparative studies need to use clear definitions that are suited to
ECOLOGIE, PHYSIOLOGIE
ET ETHOLOGIE
the questions they are asking (Kappeler 2014 TREE 29, pp.591-593). The definition
of sociality used in our analysis is intended to differentiate between species where
23 rue Becquerel breeding females are intolerant of each other but associate with dependent young
F-67087 Strasbourg Cedex 2
UMR 7178 for part of the year and those where breeding groups include several females that
breed regularly. Our definition of social monogamy is intended to distinguish
between species where individual males associate temporarily with receptive
females but there are no long-lasting pair-bonds that persist across years and species
where individual males and individual females form long-lasting bonded pairs; and
our definition of cooperative breeding was intended to distinguish between species
where several breeding females share care of their offspring (communal breeders)
and species where young are provisioned and guarded by non-breeders (cooperative
breeders). While we accept that these definitions are more specific than those used
Carsten Schradin by some other classifications of mammalian social organisation, we believe that they
are well suited to answering the questions we investigate.

Comments to the Author(s)
One of the primary interests for evolutionary biologists is to describe the evolutionary
drivers for a particular trait. Detailed studies of single species can help to establish this, but
there is always the anxiety that the particular species may be ‘peculiar’ in some way, and
that there is a need to look at multiple species to arrive at generalities. So there is a real
value to conduct comparative studies. However, as made clear by this commentary –
comparative studies need to set a high standard. They are extracting data from
the literature, but that data needs to be of high quality. Schradin has convinced us
that Lukas&Clutton-Brock2017OpenScience do not reach the standard that should
be expected and therefore this commentary is justified.
Schradin is particularly justified to make this commentary because he has already
made a criticism of the dataset in Lukas&Clutton-Brock2013Science which is used
again in Lukas&Clutton-Brock2017OpenScience. Schradin’s criticism was explicit

DEPARTEMENT (Valomyetal.2015BiologyLetters). Lukas&Clutton-Brock2017OpenScience
ECOLOGIE, PHYSIOLOGIE
ET ETHOLOGIE
completely disregard this criticism.
23 rue Becquerel Regarding Schradin’s commentary, it needs to be reworded. It needs a better
F-67087 Strasbourg Cedex 2
UMR 7178 organisation and should be more focused/more concise.
The order of topics should be:
1) A general statement about the value of a comparative approach, but making the
point that it is really critical that high standards are set.
>A paragraph on this has been added as first paragraph.
2) Make a brief statement that Lukas&Clutton-Brock2017OpenScience makes use of
previously published datasets on social monogamy (Lukas&Clutton-Brock2013Science) and
Carsten Schradin cooperative breeding (Lukas&Clutton-Brock2012ProcRSoc) and that there are flaws in both.
>Included as second paragraph
T. (33) 03 88 10 69 19
F. (33) 03 88 10 74 56 3) Make a detailed description of the shortcomings of the Lukas&Clutton-
carsten.schradin@iphc.cnrs.fr Brock2013Science data on social monogamy – pointing out that these flaws have already
been criticised in Valomyetal.2015BiologyLetters. The Table 1 that Schradin includes in the
commentary should be included as part of this description, but Suncus etruscus should be
included in that table.
>Included as second paragraph
The information on Sunucs etruscus has been added to the table.
4) The much briefer criticism of the cooperative breeding data should also be made,
pointing out that this criticism is made for the first time.
>I don’t understand this comment. Always the same database was used by Lukas and
Clutton-Brock. My comment is not about a specific paper / data-analysis, but about the
database. I deleted the paragraph making the statement that the analysis using the flawed
database does not give any support, as this is self-evident, and I want to focus my criticism
on the database. (This criticism is now extended due to the response by Lukas & Clutton-
Brock, indicating additional problems with their database).
Sous la co-tutelle de
5) Conclude with text saying that the hypothesis put forward in Lukas&Clutton-
Brock2017OpenScience may well be correct, but it needs to be tested with data that has
been better checked. Finish by saying that there is a strong need for funding to support
primary studies of the sort that would be valuable for a comparative studies such as
Lukas&Clutton-Brock2017OpenScience.
>I changed the wording of the conclusion, making clear that I criticize the database. I also
state: “My criticism doesn’t make a statement whether or not the claims of their studies are
correct.”
Once the text has been ordered in this way, it will be possible to review the
commentary in fine detail.

Appendix B
Schradin’s Commentary on our paper is unusual for, as he is (as stated in the
revised version) not contesting the conclusions and we can show that the
differences in the classification of shrews described in his Table 1 do not affect
the results of our quantitative analysis showing that the evolution of cooperative
breeding in mammals is associated with arid, unpredictable conditions. Instead,
his Commentary is concerned with the methods we used to classify species into
different categories based on their breeding systems and with parts of our
database that are not directly relevant to this paper. We believe that it would be
useful to make this clear at the outset, as we stated in our first review. While we
think that it might be useful to publish an exchange with Schradin concerning
our paper, this will only be productive if it is as clear and constructive as
possible. At the moment, Schradin’s commentary is confrontational and this
obscures several of the issues at stake.
We have four general criticisms of his Commentary: there is a serious
misconception concerning the sources that we used to categorize different shrew
species; his presentation of differences in the classification of shrew breeding
systems between his paper and ours is misleading as there are fundamental
differences in the definitions of sociality and monogamy used in the two papers
that he does not describe and needs to make clear; he criticizes our paper for
drawing on incidental observations of variable quality – but then uses similar
non-quantitative observations to classify shrews himself; and he criticizes the
use of taxonomic inference (the allocation of species for which no primary
information is available to the same categories as related species that share
similar ecological or life history characteristics) in parts of our database but does
1
not mention either that our analysis of the distribution of monogamous species
and cooperative breeders (the two categories whose distribution our paper
compares) does not use inferred allocations or that taxonomic inference is
widely used by broad comparative studies, including two of the three
comparative studies that he praises in his opening paragraph. We think that it
would be more useful if his Commentary provided a more detailed account of the
information used to classify shrews and showed how contrasts in the definition
of categories can generate contrasts in the classification of species, discussed the
pros and cons of different ways of categorizing breeding systems and examined
the circumstances where taxonomic inference is justified and when it is not. We
also think that his general suggestions regarding the refereeing of comparative
studies, the use of taxonomic inference and the funding of field research require
more extensive consideration than his Commentary can afford and question
whether this is the appropriate place to publish them.
Below, we deal with each of these issues in turn:
(1) Schradin repeatedly states that our classification of breeding systems is
based on a single secondary reference. This is incorrect, though we understand
why this misunderstanding has arisen. Our categorization of shrews was based
on more than 65 sources, which allowed us to directly allocate more than 70 of
the 366 shrew species to our different categories of breeding system. Under the
house rules of Science, where the description of the database used in our paper
(Lukas & Clutton-Brock 2013) was published as supplementary material, we
2
were asked not to include all 2000+ references used to categorize species in our
database so, where possible, we listed generic reviews that outlined the
consensus view of social organization in each taxon and stated in our
supplementary material that we used many additional sources to classify each
species. Below we list the 60+ references that we used to classify the breeding
system of shrews. This represents a more extensive collection of sources than
those identified by Valomy et al., probably because their search only relied on
Google Scholar.
(2) In his text and in Table 1, Schradin emphasizes the contrasts between his
classification of the social organization of shrews and ours, but he does not
describe the definitions of our categories or provide definitions of the categories
that he and Valomy et al. use. As our 2013 paper describes, we classify species as
solitary breeders if breeding females occupy separate ranges and do not
aggregate with other breeding females during the breeding season; as socially
monogamous if the same adult males and adult females form breeding pairs that
persist across seasons; and as cooperative breeders if non-breeding group
members contribute to rearing offspring born to others. Since breeding females
do not aggregate in groups in monogamous species or in singular cooperative
breeders, we regard both these categories as subsets of solitary breeders. It is
clear that Schradin uses a different classificatory system from ours, though he
does not define his categories in his Commentary and his paper with Valomy
only describes how species were classified as monogamous “if adults typically
live in pairs”. To avoid Table 1 giving the misleading impression that species are
3
being classified differently on the same system, Schradin should include a clear
description of our categories and definitions as well as of his own, making it clear
(i) whether he includes species where females associate with non-breeding
offspring for part of the year as social (ii), whether species where females may
sleep together outside the breeding season but occupy separate ranges when
they breed are classified as social, and whether (iii) he regards sightings of a
single unidentified female and a single unidentified male as evidence of pair
formation. Our categories were designed (after extensive consultation) to be
applicable to a wide range of species but we are very ready to concede that they
have their disadvantages. With one exception (where new data are available) we
believe that all the shrew species listed in Schradin’s Table 1 have been correctly
allocated to the categories that we use (see our attached Table). We think that it
would be more useful to debate the pros and cons of different classificatory
systems than to pursue a critique of our paper based on the misleading
suggestion that many species have been misclassified.
(3) Both in his Commentary and his paper with Valomy, Schradin is critical of the
information on which our classification of shrews is based. Like Schradin, we are
advocates of long-term studies that collect precise data on behaviour and
reproduction of identifiable individuals that are based on genetic analyses
(Clutton-Brock & Sheldon 2010 Trends in Ecology & Evolution). However,
detailed records of the life-histories and behaviour of recognizable individuals
are still too rare to provide a basis for broad comparisons of the distribution of
breeding systems and, like previous comparative analyses of vertebrate breeding
4
systems (e.g. Cockburn 2006 Proceedings B, Hughes et al. 2008 Science,
Ebensperger et al. 2012 Journal of Animal Ecology, Borries et al. 2016
Evolutionary Anthropology), we have had to rely partly on incidental
observations and descriptions of the behaviour of unidentified individuals drawn
from a wide range of sources of variable quality. We note that Valomy and
Schradin also found it necessary to make extensive use of non-quantitative data
in categorizing shrew species and parts of their evidence that the species they
classify as living in pairs are monogamous are less than compelling. Genetic
information that would make it possible to identify breeding pairs with certainty
is only available for one of the twelve shrew species listed in Schradin’s Table 1,
and appears to contradict the classification in Schradin’s Table 1 (Crocidura
russula: where “males paired simultaneously with up to four females and were
markedly less monogamous than expected from previous behavioural data”:
Bouteiller and Perrin 2000 Proceeding B). For only one of the species that he
classifies as living in pairs in Table 1 is there evidence that breeding adults
associate with each other throughout all seasons. Finally, several of their
allocations appear questionable: for example, they classify Sorex cinereus as
“group-living” on the basis of a sighting of one female chased by three males
(Maier & Doyle 2006 Mammalia); and Crocidura leucodon as pair-living on the
basis that the home ranges of males overlap with those of females during three
breeding months (Simeonovska-Nikolova 2004 Acta Theriol). As there is little
evidence that a substantial proportion of individuals form mixed sex pairs that
persist for more than one breeding season, with one potential exception (see
below), we classified shrews as solitary breeders and believe that they were
correctly assigned on our criteria. While this differs from Valomy and Schradin’s
5
paper, it is consistent with most reviews of shrew breeding systems, which also
regard shrews as solitary breeders (e.g. Kirkland & Merritt 1994 Advances in the
biology of shrews; Churchfield 1990 The natural history of shrews; Rychlik &
Zworak 2006 Can J Zool)
(4) Schradin is critical of the listing in our dataset of some shrews for which no
primary data is available as solitary breeders, based on taxonomic inference. The
issue of taxonomic inference is not directly relevant to the main focus of the
analyses he is commenting on for we do not classify species as monogamous or
cooperative breeders unless primary data of some kind is available. However, as
we describe in the material associated with our database, we classify species
there as solitary or social breeders where primary data show that species
belonging to the same taxonomic group share the same breeding system and
evidence of life history parameters suggests that species for which no primary
data are available are likely to share the same breeding system. In the case of
shrews, we have been able to find primary sources for 72 species, none of which
form breeding groups that include more than one breeding female, few
individuals live for more than a year and most researchers describe shrews as
solitary breeders (e.g.: Churchfield 1980 Acta Theriol; Haberl 1996 Acta Theriol,
Gliwicz & Taylor 2002 Acta Theriol). We consequently list all shrews as solitary
breeders. More generally, Schradin does not appear to appreciate that most
broad comparative studies rely on taxonomic inference to a greater or lesser
degree, including both the comparative studies of birds that he praises in his
opening paragraph and juxtaposes to our analysis. The analyses by Jetz &
6
Rubenstein (2011 Curr Biol) and by Gonzalez et al. (2013 Proceedings B) rely on
a dataset by Cockburn (2006 Proceedings B) that makes extensive use of
taxonomic inference: it frequently assigns species with missing information the
category of congeners and, when information is available for none of the species
within a genus, assigns all species of that genus the category of ‘pair-living’. We
believe that a discussion of the use of inference in comparative studies might be
useful but that this should be set in a broader context and should recognize the
need for broad comparative analyses to use taxonomic inference to assess the
frequency and distribution of traits. One practical improvement that might be
worth considering would be for comparative datasets to incorporate a clear
demarcation between allocations based on inference and those based on primary
data of some kind and we plan to incorporate this into our database in future.
In summary, we believe that Schradin’s current commentary needs substantial
changes before it would provide a useful and constructive basis for a published
exchange. Specifically, it needs to correct misconceptions about the sources we
used to classify shrews; to describe the basis of the system that he uses to
classify species and to clarify contrasts with the classification that we use; to
place his critique of the information we use in a more general context; and to
recognize that taxonomic inference has been used in most broad comparative
analyses. Finally, we believe that several of the general issues that Schradin
raises (including the refereeing of comparative studies, the kind of information
that comparative studies should use and the distribution of field research)
7
should be set in a broader context and may require more we extensive
discussion than is feasible here.

4.) Reply to the three specific points raised by Schradin
(i) Structural zeros
Our decision to classify shrew species as solitary based on primary data showing
that species belonging to the same taxonomic group share the same breeding
system and on evidence of life history parameters could create biased estimates
if we were to compare the lifespan of solitary species with that of socially
monogamous species. However, as the aim of our paper was to compare socially
monogamous species to cooperative breeders, we did not use inference to
classify these species, and our analysis does not investigate life-history
parameters.
(ii) Suncus etruscus
Our initial classification of Suncus etruscus as socially monogamous was based on
its description in the review by Kleiman & Malcolm (1981). We have found
additional information, published since our original classification, which
indicates that females of the Etruscan shrew are solitary and aggressive towards
other females and towards males outside the breeding season (Kingdon et al.
2013 Mammals of Africa) and we shall change its classification accordingly in
future analyses.
(iii) Shrews versus other short-lived rodents
While for socially monogamous species in the genera Microtus and Peromyscus
reports exist that pairs can remain together across years (e.g. Ribble 1992), no
such reports exist for any shrew species. Instead, all reports indicate that, even if
both partners survive, pairs disband during the winter, frequently forming
aggregations (see the detailed review of 40 species by Rychlik 1998).

Dear Editors of Royal Society Open Science,
Please find attached a revised version of a commentary entitled “Comparative
studies must not only rely on good statistical skills, but also on good data!”. This
commentary is a response to a paper recently published in Royal Society Open
Science:
Lukas D, Clutton-Brock T. 2017 Climate and the distribution of cooperative breeding in
mammals. Royal Society Open Science 4(1). (doi:10.1098/rsos.160897).

Below I describe how I responded to the comments of the referees.
DEPARTEMENT
ECOLOGIE, PHYSIOLOGIE
ET ETHOLOGIE To allow for a productive discussion, I ask you to forward my response below to
Lukas & Clutton-Brock, such that they can take this into account when writing their

Comments to the Author:
T. (33) 03 88 10 69 19 The revised manuscript has been seen by one of the previous 'independent' referees
F. (33) 03 88 10 74 56 (with the second independent referee having been previously satisfied with the
carsten.schradin@iphc.cnrs.fr revisions) as well as the authors of the original manuscript that is being commented
on.
The 'independent' referee has a list of minor corrections that should all be acted
upon, whilst the authors of the original manuscript have more substantive criticisms.
Given the nature of commentary pieces then it is up to the author of this
commentary to decide to what extent he incorporates revisions to the text to
accommodate points made by the original authors, keeping in mind that these
original authors should be given the opportunity to respond to the commentary
piece.

Comments to the Author(s)
This commentary has been improved after the review process and, except for a long
list of important but small corrections, it is ready for publication. The author is
justified to point out the short-comings of the data sourcing for the Lukas & Clutton-
Brock paper and makes points that are of general relevance.
There are several aspects that need attention:
I don’t like the reference to ‘referees’ on the first page. Better is to say that the
authors of the paper need to be careful in carrying out their comparative studies
RESPONSE: I shortened this part, but I prefer to keep a statement about referees.
If the data are available and can be reviewed, then this should be done. Of course
it’s the authors who are accountable for their data, but there is no reason why
referees should not review the database if available. If referees can’t assess the
database (because they lack the knowledge), then they can say so in their
response, and the editor can decide whether or not to ask an additional referee to
www.iphc.cnrs.fr examine at the data set.

I think there are errors in the numbered citations – the author should carefully
check ALL their numbered citations. There are other respects in which this paper
23 rue Becquerel feels ‘rushed’. The author should be very careful not to have errors – this paper is
F-67087 Strasbourg Cedex 2
UMR 7178 criticizing another paper for errors, and that message would be rather undermined
if the paper has errors of its own. Also, the quality of the writing is poor in places.
RESPONSE: I re-checked everything. There were some errors where the Endnotes
formatting got lost.
Specific comments:
Line 19 – 25: replace ‘very rare … comparative studies.’ by ‘very rare, meaning that it
is easy for errors to creep into such databases.’
Carsten Schradin RESPONSE: I kept the original wording, as I want to emphasize the difficulty to
review such a database, not to build it up.

F-67087 Strasbourg Cedex 2
UMR 7178 The comments to the author are in the attached pdf file, since they contain a
table.
RESPONSE:
I don’t respond here point by point but only address the changes made due to their
comments:
My commentary is critical but my aim was not to be confrontational. I gave the
revised manuscript to three colleagues for comments, two of which had not seen the
Carsten Schradin manuscript before. None of them thought that the manuscript is confrontational,
and their comments helped me to rephrase or delete phrases that might sound too
T. (33) 03 88 10 69 19 critical. For example, I changed the title.
F. (33) 03 88 10 74 56
carsten.schradin@iphc.cnrs.fr I feel the authors wanted to divert me away from my original point (i.e. not to
include assumed data for hundreds species which have not been studied in the field)
to a discussion of theirs versus my definitions of different forms of social
organization. They can raise this point in their response, but I do not want to address
this myself in more detail than I already did, as this was not the reason to write this
comment (nor does it solve the issue, in my point of view). But this information is
now also provided in the table heading and explained in more detail in the text. I
also emphasize that I talk about pairs (social organization) while they talk about
monogamous, which might include information on the mating system as well.
Other points:
I already mentioned differences in definitions and I emphasize this further. They
should note that in the current commentary I only refer to data from the breeding
season (in Valomy et al. data from breeding versus non-breeding seasons are
presented and it’s indicated for which season the social organization is reported). In
Sous la co-tutelle de
their last response they did not take this into account.
I make clear that if there are doubts about the quality of the data for a species (as
might be the case in some of the shrew studies we cited), then the best solution
would be not to use the data and not to make assumptions about the species being
solitary. In their response they should outline why they think it is appropriate to
assume a species for which the social organization is not known is solitary, which it
seems they regard as the default social structure in mammals (though one cannot
first assume these species to be solitary, and then test in models whether the
ancestor was solitary, as this would be testing for ones assumptions using these
assumptions as the data).
Generally, if no data exist, this does not justify assumptions about the data. 50
years ago, we had nearly no data on the social organization of free living
mammals. If now we still don’t have enough data for comparative studies, then
instead of assuming data we might have to wait for more comparative studies to
be done reliably.

DEPARTEMENT “Taxonomic inference (the allocation of species for which no primary
ECOLOGIE, PHYSIOLOGIE
ET ETHOLOGIE
information is available to the same categories as related species that share
similar ecological or life history characteristics)”: I include now a statement that
23 rue Becquerel this can be a general problem, citing the mentioned study by Cockburn which used
F-67087 Strasbourg Cedex 2
UMR 7178 the same procedure. If they know of more such studies, they should cite these and
explain why the authors believe this procedure of data fabrication is acceptable.
I am not aware of this term nor did find good information on this. In their response,
they should thus focus on this topic. The colleagues I know working on phylogenetic
comparative studies told me they hope nobody includes species into their database
for which no data exist. They were not familiar with the term “taxonomic inference”
either. While there are statistical methods to neutrally calculate missing
independent variables in large datasets (to be able to use the data which are
Carsten Schradin available for other independent variables), these methods cannot be applied for the
dependent variable.
T. (33) 03 88 10 69 19
F. (33) 03 88 10 74 56 Additional references: It is good to see that more references are available. This
carsten.schradin@iphc.cnrs.fr makes one wonder why a paper has been cited in the Science supplement that does
not provide data on the social organization of a single species. In July 2015, when we
were working on the Biol Let paper and searching for literature, D. Lukas wrote to
me: “The reference "Murariu & Benedek 2005", which states that shrews are
solitary, is:
NEW REPORTS ON THE PRESENCE OF SOREX ALPINUS SCHINZ, 1837 (INSECTIVORA:
SORICIDAE) IN THE SOUTHERN CARPATHIANS (ROMANIA)
Murariu, DUMITRU and Benedek, AM”
It would have been good to communicate the other references then, not 2 years
later. I see that many of these references are secondary literature, unpublished PhD
theses, might only report assumptions based on limited trapping data, or report data
on social structure or mating system but not social organization; as such, the
information differs from what we found in the primary literature. Thus, in their
response they should indicate the differences in acquiring data, i.e. primary
literature versus all available information including secondary literature and
Sous la co-tutelle de
unpublished data.
Our Biol Let was seen by two of the top scientists working on shrews and none of
them communicated that we would have missed the majority of available data on
social organization.
I am aware of many of these references and the student who worked on this project
cited them in her report with regards of discussion of the mating system or social
structure, but she did not find information regarding the social organization in these
papers. This discussion of mating system and social structure was removed from
the paper published in Biol. Let. Apart from this, it is likely that we missed some
primary information on some species which we did not list.
About the adequate place to publish such a commentary: In 2015 we discussed
whether to submit a comment to Science, where the original database was
published. We did not do so, as we did not want to criticize colleagues but
improve science. As the database did not improve, I now felt it is time to submit
www.iphc.cnrs.fr such a commentary.
