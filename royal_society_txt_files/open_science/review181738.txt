Title: Adsorption behavior of new theophylline-triazole based derivatives as effective corrosion
inhibitors for steel in acidic medium
Series of theophylline derivatives containing 1,2,3-triazole moieties were synthesized,
characterized, and studied as corrosion inhibitor for API 5L X52 steel in 1 M HCl medium by
Espinoza-Vázquez et al. Electrochemical techniques namely EIS and PDP were used in the
investigation and was supported with SEM and EDS analysis. The study is of interest and the
results presented well interpreted. However, MINOR revision needs to be done before
publication. Here are some of the issues:
1. Individual graph in the PDP plot should be labeled since authors are using line plotting.
Otherwise, they should replot with line and symbol.
2. The mechanism of adsorption of the studied inhibitor should be fully discussed.
3. The authors should present the OCP-time graph to convince readers that OCP stability was
achieved before measurements.
4. Additional surface analysis like AFM, XRD, and/or XPS is needed. This will greatly improve
the quality of this manuscript.

The authors have studied five new Theophylline derivatives bearing Triazole moieties for their
corrosion inhibition behavior on steel in 1M HCl solution. All the synthesized inhibitors have
been very well characterized through their spectral data.The paper can be considered for
publication after satisfactory response to following comments:
1. How did the authors convert Molar solution to ppm concentration? Did the authors check the
inhibiting effect of DMF alone and in the presence of inhibitor because DMF also acts as
inhibitor?
2. In EDX Fig, the presence of inhibitor is not visible. How did authors confirm the adsorption of

3. There is no explanation of ßa and ßc values in Tafel polarization study. The sign of ßc
should be negative.
4. The range for polarization ± 500 mV is very high. Is there any reason for this? The sweep rate
should be 0.1mV /sec.
5. In EIS study, Bode plot should be provided to understand the adsorption behavior of
inhibitors.
6. What is r mol? Is it film resistance? Clarify
7. The mechanism of inhibition should be clearly discussed. Which form of the inhibitor is
predominantly adsorbed: Neutral or protonated? It should be clearly stated based on DFT
calculation.
8. Adsorption isotherm should be redrawn by selecting proper values on X and Y axis
9. Fig 8: EDX is reported for 5 and 20 ppm concentration while optimum concentration is 50 ppm.

TITLE: Adsorption behavior of new theophylline-triazole based derivatives as effective corrosion
inhibitors for steel in acidic medium
COMMENTS
The manuscript reports on the synthesis, characterization of theophylline-triazole based
derivatives and evaluation of corrosion inhibition performance for API 5L X52 steel corrosion in 1
M HCl solution. The corrosion inhibition effect was investigated using electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization techniques complemented by surface
morphological characterization of the corroded carbon steel samples without and with the
inhibitors with SEM/EDS. The manuscript is of interest in the fields of materials and corrosion.
The synthesis and characterization of the compounds used as inhibitors is well treated but the
same cannot be said of the corrosion inhibition behavior of the synthesized compounds. In its
present form, the manuscript is not recommended for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Major revision of the paper is needed before consideration for publication. The issues to be
addressed by the authors are appended below:
(1) The Title of the manuscript should be modified to read "Adsorption and corrosion inhibition
behavior of new theophylline-triazole based derivatives for steel in acidic medium"
(2) There are important keywords not listed and the irrelevant ones are listed. Words like Acid,
Theophylline, Corrosion inhibition, Steel should form part of the keywords if required by the
journal.
(3) On page 2 line 14, 'adsorpted' should be corrected to 'adsorbed'. Also in line 24, 'absord'
should be corrected to 'adsorb'
(4) The idea that the synthesized compounds were tested as 'environmentally friendly' is rather
speculative and not based on experimental evidence as they were not tested experimentally to
ensure that they meet the three criteria of a compound to be designated as 'environmentally
friendly' which are toxicity, biodegradability and bioaccumulation. Hence the statement in line 31
of page 2 should be revised to clear this ambiguity.
(5) It is not clear if the authors had check the purity of the synthesized compounds given that the
melting point range is large as could be seen as follows: Compound 2 (220-226 oC); Compound 3
(169-172 oC), Compound 4 (182-186 oC); Compound 6 (194-198 °C.) Compound 7 (180-184 °C.).
(6) The discussion on EIS measurements results should be rewritten. It is very shallow and
should be expanded to convey meaning. Fundamental questions like the need of using constant
phase element in the equivalent circuit need to be answered. Also for the purpose of clarity, the
authors need to use appropriate scientific words to describe the technique. It is not clear what the
authors meant by "the results were adjusted using equivalent electric circuits"
(7) The authors should also present the EIS results in Bode formats as the number of time
constants is better revealed in Bode representation than in Nyquist representation.
(8) Again the discussion on potentiodynamic polarization technique should be rewritten as it is
very shallow. The authors have not discuss the Fig.6 at all. The scope of the discussion should be
expanded to make meaning.
(9) In Table 1, the authors should replace the SD with Chi squared values (values of goodness of
fit) to ascertain the validity of the equivalent circuit used to fit the experimental data.
(10) The units of bc and ba are not correct. The units should be mV/dec
(11) In Table 3, the authors should the replace linear regression equation with values of the
slopes. Also values of Kads and not ln Kads should be given.
(12) Finally the English language of this manuscript is very poor and need serious improvement.
The assistance of native English speakers may be sought in this regards.

ption mechanism
rrosion inhibition of API 5L X52 in HCl 1M provoked by 1,2,3-triazoles 1,4-disubstited molecules can be
ed as follows (Figure 9): The protonated species of the organic compounds interact, throughout Columbic
with previously adsorbed chlorides ions (Cl-) present on the API 5L X52 steel surface which results in
orption of the inhibitor molecules. This way, the inhibitor molecules compete with H + for electrons on steel
s [67]. Moreover, the donation of lone electrons pairs of nitrogen atoms to the empty orbital of Fe atoms would
a chemisorption process of the organic molecule [68] and the accumulation of negative charges on the steel
can be transferred from the d orbital of Fe to unoccupied p* (anti-bonding) of 1,2,3-triazoles 1,4-disubstited
les (retro-donation) [69], see Figure 9a and 9b. The combination of these two types of adsorption mechanisms

uthors have studied five new Theophylline derivatives bearing Triazole moieties for their
ion inhibition behavior on steel in 1M HCl solution. All the synthesized inhibitors have been
well characterized through their spectral data. The paper can be considered for publication
atisfactory response to following comments:
How did the authors convert Molar solution to ppm concentration?
: There was an initial concentrated solution in order to make dilutions and finally, diluted
ons were obtained by sampling different aliquots completing with DMF However, inhibitor
ntrations are usually reported as ppm (part per million, mg/kg or mg/liter).
Did the authors check the inhibiting effect of DMF alone and in the presence of inhibitor
because DMF also acts as inhibitor?
In EDX Fig, the presence of inhibitor is not visible. How did authors confirm the adsorption
of inhibitor on steel surface?
: As can be noted from Figure 10 in the revised version the peak associated with carbon is much
e in the presence of the inhibitor, see Figures 10f and 10h that on the bare steel sample, see
e 10b therefore, this may be indicated of the presence of the inhibitors on the steel sample
e. In the revised version, we have added the following to clarify this point.
ot observed in the chemical analysis (Figures 10f and 10h). However, as can be noted from Figure 10 in the
version the peak associated with carbon is much intense in the presence of the inhibitor, see Figures 10f and
t on the bare steel sample, see Figure 10b therefore, this may be indicated of the presence of the inhibitors on
el sample surface.
There is no explanation of ßa and ßc values in Tafel polarization study. The sign of ßc
should be negative.

The range for polarization ± 500 mV is very high. Is there any reason for this? The sweep
rate should be 0.1mV /sec.
In EIS study, Bode plot should be provided to understand the adsorption behavior of
inhibitors.
Reply: We agree with this observation. Therefore, in the revised version we have included the
bode plots.
Bode plots for API 5L X52 steel in the absence and presence of various concentrations of 1,2,3-triazoles 1,4-
ited are represented in Fig. 5. An ideal capacitor is characterized by a fixed value of slope (unity) and phase
-90°). The increase in the values of phase angle in presence of different inhibitor concentrations suggest that
roughness of API 5L X52 steel decreased due to formation of protective film by theophylline-triazole
ive [44]. The result indicated that there was two-time constant coupled, and the system could be described by
esistances which consists of electrolyte resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct), organic molecules
ed resistance (Rmol) and double layer capacitance, as shown in Fig 2b. While, in absence inhibitor the phase
s log frequency shows one-time constant attributed to charge transfer resistance [45].
, the corrosion inhibition effectiveness of 1,2,3-triazoles 1,4-disubstited can also be interpreted in the real

rent inhibitor concentrations.
What is r mol? Is it film resistance? Clarify
: The Rmol term refers to the “resistance of the organic molecules adsorbed” usually employed
fferent authors in papers related with inhibitors. Even when some authors name this value as
resistance”, we prefer not to use this term since there could be confusion with the formation of
anic film coming from the molecules, instead of an interface formed by adsorbed molecules to
etallic surface.
The mechanism of inhibition should be clearly discussed. Which form of the inhibitor is
predominantly adsorbed: Neutral or protonated? It should be clearly stated based on DFT
calculation.
Reply: We agree with this comment thus, in the revised version of our manuscript we have
included a new section regarding the mechanism of inhibition
ption mechanism
rrosion inhibition of API 5L X52 in HCl 1M provoked by 1,2,3-triazoles 1,4-disubstited molecules can be
ed as follows (Figure 9): The protonated species of the organic compounds interact, throughout Columbic
with previously adsorbed chlorides ions (Cl-) present on the API 5L X52 steel surface which results in
orption of the inhibitor molecules. This way, the inhibitor molecules compete with H + for electrons on steel
s [67]. Moreover, the donation of lone electrons pairs of nitrogen atoms to the empty orbital of Fe atoms would
a chemisorption process of the organic molecule [68] and the accumulation of negative charges on the steel
can be transferred from the d orbital of Fe to unoccupied p* (anti-bonding) of 1,2,3-triazoles 1,4-disubstited
les (retro-donation) [69], see Figure 9a and 9b. The combination of these two types of adsorption mechanisms

Quantum chemical calculations have also been included within a new section named
“Theoretical assessment”. Alejandra M. Navarrete-López was responsible for the calculations.
1 Theoretical assessment
esence of nitrogen as heteroatom in the inhibitor molecules provides high tendency toward protonation in
s acidic medium. Under these conditions the calculations were carry out for the complete set of electrons and
metry of involved structures was fully optimized. In other words, the nitrogen atoms hold positive charge by
sented in Figure 11.
important fact in the adsorption over the metallic surface is the planar configuration of the inhibitor
les. The frameworks of these geometries show no planar configurations for all the inhibitors. Some angles are
d in Figure 11, the halogen substitute has an important effect over the dihedral angle, particularly with Iodine.
um-chemical indexes EHOMO, ELUMO, GAP, hardness <U+03B7>, and dipole moment are summarized in Table 4. It
wn that EHOMO is often related to electron donation ability of the inhibitor molecules toward the metallic
atoms, and it is expected that a higher EHOMO value would favor a greater charge transfer [70]. According
e results, the values of EHOMO show the following behavior: compound 7 > compound 6 > compound 5 >
und 3 > compound 4. In this case, the notorious largest EHOMO corresponds to compound 7 in line with the
entioned experiments at low concentrations and the lowest EHOMO corresponds to compound 4 that in terms
ity is the worst inhibitor.
ther authors (for instance [71]) have found that a smaller value of the hardness is related to greater stability
urface-inhibitor complex formed. The trend that we got was 4 > 3 > 5 > 6 > 7, as it can be observed in Table 4.
he complex metallic surface-compound 7 presents the best stability and inhibition efficiency at low
trations.
ver, smaller values of ELUMO present better capacity of the inhibitor to accept electrons, for this property the
with solvent was compound 7 < 4 < 5, 6 < 3. Negative values of ELUMO indicate the capability to accept
ns too. Nevertheless, there is not a clear relationship between the above last two properties.
overall electrophilicity and according to the computed values (see Table 5), compound 7 exhibited a better
philic character with solvent effect. Whereas compound 4 was lower than the rest. Therefore, a better
tion of compound 7 with the metallic surface would be expected than for the rest of compounds, the
nces are not significant.
irshfeld atomic charges for the most important centers with solvent effect are summarized in Table 6.
ibution of the charge is observed by the presence of the substituent, the atoms that have a larger negative
, suggests that those are active centers with excess charges that it could act as a nucleophilic group. The most
ble sites for the interaction with the metal surface are the Oxygen atoms, 24 and 25, see Figure 11 and Table 6,
he selected compounds. As it has been expected, fluorine in compound 4 is the best electro-attractor followed
orine, the halogen substitutes are active sites for the inhibition. The Carbon 8, in all the compounds, is another
philic center. The Carbon 13 in compound 7 also gains charge.
mental data revels that compound 7 is the best inhibitor of the corrosion, the geometric structure and the
eters here studied such as EHOMO, hardness, electrophilicity and atomic charges support this fact.

e discussion on EIS measurements results should be rewritten. It is very shallow and should
panded to convey meaning. Fundamental questions like the need of using constant phase
nt in the equivalent circuit need to be answered. Also for the purpose of clarity, the authors
to use appropriate scientific words to describe the technique. It is not clear what the authors
t by "the results were adjusted using equivalent electric circuits"
: In the final version, we have modified the discussion in the results section.
1 OCP and EIS Electrochemical evaluation
shows the variations in time of the open circuit potential (OCP) in static conditions at 50 ppm, at the electrode
of API 5L X52 steel in presence of different inhibitor concentrations. It should be mentioned that it was
ary the stabilization of the OCP previously to do the EIS determinations. The steady state was reached after
econds. Fig. 3b corresponds to the Nyquist diagram for the system without inhibitor, which depicts a
sed semicircle reaching a maximum Zreal value of 30 <U+2126> cm2 (adjusted with electrical circuit Figure 2a).
quist diagrams of each of the theophylline-triazoles are shown in Figs. 4a-4e. As can be seen, the diameter of
icircle increases proportionally with the inhibitor’s concentration. According to the shape of the semicircle,
e constant (using the circuit figure 2b) can be attributed, the charge transference resistance and the second to
ed molecules resistance [36-38]. The depressed semicircle is attributed due to frequency dispersion effect and
irregularities and heterogeneities [39].
be observed that the Zreal value presents a large variation. Based on these results, it can be inferred that the
ce of a halogen substituent in para position of the aromatic ring can modulate the inhibition capacity of the
und.
btaining the Nyquist diagrams of the compounds at different concentrations, the impedance results for API
steel with and without inhibitor can be explained by an equivalent circuit (Figure 2) which comprise of Rct
pedance of CPE is given by the next equation [41]:
<U+0001D44D><U+0001D436><U+0001D443><U+0001D438> = <U+0001D444>-1 (<U+0001D457><U+0001D714>)-n (1)
Y0 is the magnitude of the CPE, n the CPE exponent (phase shift), <U+03C9> the angular frequency (<U+03C9>=2<U+043F>f, where f is
frequency), and j here is the imaginary unit. The capacity correction to its real values was calculated from Eq.
ere <U+03C9>max is the frequency at which the imaginary part of the impedance (-Zimag) has a maximum. Cdl represents
uble layer capacitance (Eq. 2).
" <U+0001D45B>-1
<U+0001D436>dl = <U+0001D44C>0 (<U+0001D714><U+0001D45A> ) (2)

he authors should also present the EIS results in Bode formats as the number of time
ants is better revealed in Bode representation than in Nyquist representation.
Reply: Reply: We agree with this observation. Therefore, in the revised version we have
included the bode plots.
Bode plots for API 5L X52 steel in the absence and presence of various concentrations of 1,2,3-triazoles 1,4-
ited are represented in Fig. 5. An ideal capacitor is characterized by a fixed value of slope (unity) and phase

ain, the discussion on potentiodynamic polarization technique should be rewritten as it is
hallow. The authors have not discussed the Fig.6 at all. The scope of the discussion should
panded to make meaning.
: We agree with this observation. The discussion on potentiodynamic polarization technique
dded in the revised version as follows:
nced at 5 ppm inhibitor concentration; indicating that the anodic dissolution of API 5L X52 steel and cathodic
on of hydrogen ions were inhibited [50].
ggests that the rate of electrochemical reaction was reduced due to the formation of a protective layer of
or molecules over the steel surface [51].
rmore, the cathodic Tafel curves are parallel (Fig. 5a and 5b), which shows that there is no change in the
en evolution mechanism with the addition of 1,2,3-triazoles 1,4-disubstited. and the reduction of hydrogen
ainly takes place through a charge transfer [52]…
