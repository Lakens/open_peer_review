An important and tidy work by Boersma et al. I only had a few minor comments and editorial
items listed within the body of the marked-up PDF. Were the illustrations publication size? If so,
they are so small, a real shame that they are not larger because this is an important and lovely
specimen. I think that their conclusions are sound. Future work is also suggested; a nice addition.
I look forward to the publication. (Appendix A)

Review by O Lambert (IRSNB, Brussels)
This short paper starts with the description of a new genus and species of platanistid from the
early Miocene of the North Pacific. This type specimen is impressive and interesting for several
aspects, and it unambiguously represents a previously unknown taxon. The description is clear,
but short, which is somewhat frustrating considering the completeness of the specimen.
Depending on the editorial guidelines of RSOS, some more details could be provided, for
example on the periotic. Also, although the diagnosis is long and detailed, the absence of direct
comparison with other platanistids is somewhat surprising, and some more comments could be
provided at the level of the rostrum morphology. The illustrations of the skull are good, but again
some more labels could be added, as well as detail views of the periotic.
Considering the sample of taxa included, I would avoid discussing the content of the superfamily
Platanistoidea. Alternatively, the two hypotheses should be provided, with and without
Squalodon.
3
The question of the evolution of the supraorbital crests among platanistoids is interesting and
fully relevant in this work, considering the surprisingly high crests observed in an animal
otherwise more similar to squalodelphinids than to most platanistids. The techniques used to
evaluate changes in the shape and inner structure of the crest are convincing and certainly yield
to interesting results, although some more details should be provided about the way the height of
the crest is measured. You will see in my comments below (and in the annotated ms) that I am
not fully convinced by the description of a possible degree of pneumatization in Dilophodelphis.
This assertion should either be modified or supported by further arguments. This may modify
somewhat the proposed scenario for the evolution of the crests among platanistids. Finally, you
do not address the potential role of the crests in the attachment of facial/rostral muscles. This
may be taken into account, at least for the early steps of the evolution of the crests (prior to the
invasion of the facial region by the pterygoid sinus system).
Find below and in the annotated manuscript more detailed suggestions and comments that may
improve the quality of this interesting and well-organized work.
- Your concept of pneumatization of the supraorbital crest may possibly benefit from some
clarification. I agree that the presence of a fossa for the orbital lobe of the pterygoid sinus is
probably not a clue for pneumatization of the crest (as in squalodelphinids). But do you consider
that a deepening of the fossa as in Pomatodelphis corresponds to pneumatization? A single fossa
inside the crest is still very different from the large extent of pneumatization along the
ventromedial surface of the crest as seen in Platanista. Furthermore, how does the fossa in
Pomatodelphis differ from the fossa noted in squalodelphinids and Araeodelphis? Additional
criteria may be useful to better separate Pomatodephis/Zarhachis from earlier branching
platanistids and squalodelphinids. Depth of the fossa?
- Based on figure 7, I cannot see any clue for pneumatization of the crest in Dilophodelphis. Slight
differences along the grey scale are most likely due to slight variations of bone compactness, as
observed in thick, non-osteosclerotic bones of many other odontocetes (see for example Lambert
et al. 2011). Cavities would be much more conspicuous.
Lambert, O., Buffrénil, V., de, and Muizon, C., de. 2011. Rostral densification in beaked whales:
diverse processes for a similar pattern. Comptes Rendus Palevol 10: 453-468.
- On a related subject, the CT scan cross section shown for "Phocageneus" in fig. 7b seems too
anterior to allow visualizing the shallow fossa for the orbital lobe of the pterygoid sinus
excavating the orbit roof. If available, I would select a somewhat more posterior cross section that
would better reflect the condition in this squalodelphinid.
- Differential diagnosis: I did not see any list of platanistid characters. This specimen is a nice
intermediary between squalodelphinids and platanistids, so it would be worth highlighting what
makes a platanistid (vs a squalodelphinid).
- l.106: The specimen USNM 475496 is identified here as Phocageneus venustus. It was first
identified as Phocageneus, cf. P. venustus by Whitmore & Kaltenbach (2008), then identified as
Squalodelphinidae by Lambert et al. (2014). Indeed, there are no points of comparison with the
type material and referred ear bones, so it may be more careful to provide a less precise
identification (at least two squalodelphinid periotic morphotypes are identified in the Lee Creek
Mine fauna). Otherwise, you may have to provide arguments.
- l.248: How confident are you that the 4 preserved teeth illustrated here correspond to
posteriormost teeth? Accessory denticles generally appear in the very last teeth of
squalodelphinids, so detached and relatively elongated teeth may possibly not be the best clue for
coding this character here. For a description of the shape of anterior and posterior teeth in a fossil
platanistid, see Lambert et al. 2008 (no need to cite the paper, but it may be useful for
comparison).

teeth from the Vienna Basin (Western Carpathians, Slovakia). Neues Jahrbuch für Geologie und
Paläontologie 250: 157-166.

- l.279: Only one difference with other platanistids is explicitly provided here. Because there is no
detailed comparison section in this work, I find it a bit frustrating not finding in the text or
diagnosis other differences, for example at the level of the rostrum length, tooth count, and
rostrum cross section shape. Differences at the level of the oral apparatus could also be included
in the discussion (ecology and feeding strategy), but this is only a suggestion.
- l.282: Three of the apomorphic features of Dilophodelphis (V-shaped antorbital notch, semi-
circular dorsal outline of the zygomatic process, square-shaped pars cochlearis) are shared with
at least part of the squalodelphinids. I would suggest at least adding a comment on this. Even if
your phylogenetic analysis produces such a result, there is a good chance that those are actually
plesiomorphic features, as compared to other platanistids.
- Considering its high value for systematics, the description of the periotic could be somewhat
expanded, providing more details about features of the anterior and posterior bullar facets (as
listed in the diagnosis). Also, is there any indication of an articular ridge/process? The detailed
paper by Muizon (1987) could be cited (only a suggestion).

(Cetacea Mammalia) from Patagonia, southern Argentina. American Museum Novitates 2904: 1-
27.
- l.426: I would suggest placing the strict consensus tree before figure 6, which is only a simplified
version of the tree.
- l.469-470: In squalodelphinids, asymmetry is also present at the level of the antorbital notches
and premaxillae at rostrum base. See Lambert et al. 2014.
- l.502: You mention that you compare density of the facial crest to density of the rostrum. It
should be noted that different bones of the rostrum (or parts of them) often display significant
differences in compactness. For example, the porcelanous part of the premaxilla is often much
more compact (see Mead & Fordyce, 2009; Lambert et al. 2011). So taking the rostrum as a whole
may possibly not be the best choice (or some rephrasing could be useful). In figure 8a, it seems
that the densest bone on the rostrum is indeed the premaxilla.
Lambert, O., Buffrénil, V., de, and Muizon, C., de. 2011. Rostral densification in beaked whales:
diverse processes for a similar pattern. Comptes Rendus Palevol 10: 453-468.
- l.511: It would be useful to precise here and in the supplementary table how the maximum
height of the crest is measured (from the orbit roof? from the approximate dorsal surface of the
non-thickened part of the maxilla + frontal?). If you measure the height of the crest from the
ventral surface of the orbit roof, it implies that the fossa for the frontal lobe of the pterygoid sinus
of squalodelphinids invades the crest.
- l.532: 'invaded by air spaces of the pterygoid air sac system': It would be great to highlight the
connection between the pterygoid sinus system and the air spaces on the ventromedial surface of
the crest of Platanista. Maybe with arrows and possibly a cross section at a different level.
- l.533: 'air pocket in-tucking from the ventral side': I guess that this corresponds to a deeper fossa
for the orbital lobe of the pterygoid sinus as compared to squalodelphinids and Araeodelphis. It
would be helpful reminding this here. The homology of the fossa in the orbit of squalodelphinids
with the deeper fossa in Pomatodelphis has bee proposed by Lambert et al. (2014, p. 995) and
Bianucci et al. (2015, p. 7).

(Squalodelphinidae, Odontoceti, Cetacea) from the early Miocene of Peru. Comptes Rendus
Palevol 14: 5-13.
5
- l.538: 'in a novel way (among odontocetes)': How does such a potential communication differ
from the connection in Platanista? Would'nt it be homologous?
- l.538-541: 'less obvious pneumatization': see comment above about the possible absence of
pneumatization in Dilophodelphis. I do not think that areas of lower density could be seen as an
intermediary stage between no pneumatization and pneumatization, and I would suggest
modifying figure 6 for the status of Dilophodelphis.
- l.554-563: This part mostly includes observations and partly repeats elements of part 3.5.a
(cranial elements). I would move all these elements in the paragraph 3.5.a, where they could be
merged with existing parts.
- l.587-590: 'Our analysis supports the concept of a monoplyletic Platanistoidea...': On which
argument did you base your decision to exclude Squalodon from Platanistoidea? I am afraid that
the sample of taxa included here is too narrow to allow testing the content of the superfamily,
considering that no delphinidan, ziphiid or physeteroid is included. I would suggest to only
focus on homodont platanistoid subclades.
- Functional morphology: There is only one specimen of Dilophodelphis described, so we cannot
have an idea about intraspecific variation at the level of the development of crests. But because
crests have been demonstrated (1) to grow during ontogeny and (2) to be highly sexually
dimorphic in several ziphiids (see Hyperoodon), it may be worth commenting on intraspecific
variation at this level in Platanista (based on literature). Based on the results of such a research, it
may be worth commenting on the possibility for the crests of Dilophodelphis to have been
sexually dimorphic. Also, if the holotype is an immature individual (as proposed by the authors),
even larger crests could be expected in older specimens. This is only a suggestion.
- Figures: In general the illustrations of the skull are of good quality, and the combination of a
photo with a second photo with an opacity mask is fine. However, I would have expected many
more labels, at least for elements described in the diagnosis and text. See comments on the
annotated pdf.
- Figure 5: Enlarged views of the periotic would be useful, especially one in the conventional
ventral view of the bone.
- Suplemental figure 1: Parts d and e are slightly misleading. This looks like sounds come from
one direction and are reflected in that same direction. In Platanista, the phonic lips are
posterodorsal and the sounds are transmitted anteroventrally. It may be needed to illustrate this
with a more tangential reflextion of sound. Otherwise, some more words of explanation would be
useful.

Review by O. Lambert
I would like to thank and congratulate the authors for the effort they made to improve a
manuscript that was already of good quality. They responded to all the queries pointed by the
reviewers, and in the few cases where they decided not to follow our recommendations they
provided arguments. I find this second version of the text and figures greatly improved, and I
could only find some very minor issues, which I highlighted directly in the pdf of the ms. They
include:
- Some suggestions for slight modifications in the text.
- A few remarks on the labeling of several figures, together with a proposal to slightly improve
figure 8 in a way to better match the corresponding discussion (stages of evolution of the
supraorbital crests).
- I also noted a problem with the numbering of references. I did not check the whole list, but at
least some of the numbers in the text do not correspond to the references in the list.
Pending the correction of these last issues, I strongly recommend publication of this interesting
paper in Royal Society Open Science. (Appendix C)

4 23 Abstract
5
6 24
7
25 Many odontocete groups have developed enlarged facial crests, although they differ
8
9
10
26 in topography, composition, and function. The most elaborate crests occur in the
11
12
27 South Asian river dolphin (Platanista gangetica), which rise dorsally as delicate,
13
14 28 pneumatized wings anterior of the facial bones. Their position wrapping around the
15
16 29 melon suggests their involvement in sound propagation for echolocation. To better
17
18 30 understand the origin of crests in this lineage, we examined facial crests among
19
20 31 fossil and living Platanistoidea, including a new taxon, Dilophodelphis fordycei, nov.
21
22 32 gen. and sp., described herein, from the early Miocene Astoria Formation of Oregon,
23
24 33 U.S.A. We measured the physical extent and thickness of platanistoid crests,
25
26 34 categorized their relative position, and used computed tomography scans to
27
28 35 examine their internal morphology and relative bone density. Integrating these traits
29
30 36 in a phylogenetic context, we determined that the onset of crest elaboration or
31
32 37 enlargement and the evolution of crest pneumatization among the platanistoids
33
34 38 were separate events, with crest enlargement beginning in the Oligocene, but no
35
36 39 pneumatization until possibly the early Miocene, although certainly by the middle
37
38 40 Miocene. Such an evolutionary context should inform modeling efforts that seek to
39
40 41 understand the diversity of sound generation morphology in Odontoceti.

44 43 1. Introduction
45
44
46
47 45 Cetacean skulls are dramatically different in construction from their closest
48
49 46 mammalian relatives, largely reflecting adaptation to demands imposed by life in
50
51 47 water versus ancestry on land. Many cetacean skull elements are posteriorly
52
53 48 ‘telescoped,’ a term referring to the elongation of rostral elements and posterior
54
55 49 movement of caudal elements, resulting in the overlap of facial bones that were
56
57 50 once adjacent in ancestral configurations more typical of land mammals [1]. In

3
4 51 odontocetes, telescoping has layered the maxillae over the frontals in the
5
6 52 antorbital/supraorbital region of the face. Many odontocete taxa (including Physeter
7
8 53 macrocephalus Linnaeus, 1758 [2], Hyperoodon amputallus Forster, 1770 [3], and Inia
9
10 54 geoffrensis (Blainville, 1817 [4])) also have elevated facial crests in the
11
12 55 antorbital/supraorbital region, composed of the frontals and maxillae. Hypotheses on
13
14 56 the function of these crests vary from taxon to taxon, including a range from
15
16 57 structural support (e.g., Physeter) to a head-butting apparatus (e.g., Hyperoodon) [5].
17
18 58
19
20 59 The most elaborate facial crests occur in the South Asian river dolphin (Platanista
21
22 60 spp.) (Lebeck, 1801 [6]), where they rise dorsally above the level of the nuchal crest
23
24 61 in the supraorbital region as extremely thin wings, and extend anteriorly to the level
25
26 62 of the antorbital notches. In Platanista, these crests are unique among cetaceans
27
28 63 both because of their relative size and because they are completely pneumatized.
29
30
64 The pterygoid air sac system, which is usually limited to the ventral side of the skull,
31
32
65 invades dorsally and lines the entire medial surface of the supraorbital crests [7,8].
33
34
35
66 The crests also wrap around the melon, a fatty organ involved in sound generation.
36
37
67 Both the position and pneumatization of the crests suggest their involvement in the
38
39 68 generation or propagation of sound in the head, though this hypothesis is difficult
40
41 69 to test both experimentally, and even more so logistically considering the
42
43 70 endangered status of this species [9,10]
44
45 71
46
47 72 To better understand the evolutionary origin of the crests and pneumatization in this
48
49 73 lineage, we examined the supraorbital crests in a group phylogenetically allied with
50
51 74 Platanista. Termed Platanistoidea, this group of cetaceans consists of taxa whose
52
53 75 stratigraphic range spans from the mid-Oligocene to the present, including almost
54
55 76 exclusively marine forms except for Platanista [11]. We measured the relative size of
56
57 77 the crests, analyzed their cranial element composition, and characterized their shape.

5
6 79 morphology and relative bone density of the crests.
7
8 80
9
10 81 Results show that almost all members of the group Platanistidae (sensu Boersma
11
12 82 and Pyenson 2016 [11]), including a new taxon Dilophodelphis Boersma, McCurry &
13
14 83 Pyenson, 2017, have elevated crests that show pneumatization, though the
15
16 84 pneumatization differs in different taxa. More basal branching platanistoids, and the
17
18 85 basal-most platanistid Araeodelphis Kellogg, 1957 [12], show small supraorbital
19
20 86 crests, and with no patent pneumatization. Both crest elevation and pneumatization
21
22 87 evolved only once among platanistoids (in the lineage leading to
23
24 88 Squalodelphinidae+Platanistidae), although at different times. Also, Platanista is
25
26 89 unique in the size of its crests, their cranial elements compositions, and the shape
27
28 90 which likely concentrates sound reflections during the signal generation phase of
29
30
91 underwater echolocation.

37
38 95 2.1. Data collection
39 96
40
41 97 To examine and compare internal supraorbital crest morphology, we selected
42
43 98 candidate specimens from putative platanistoid groups (see Boersma and Pyenson
44
45 99 [11] for a discussion), which were then CT scanned using Nikon Metrology’s
46
47 100 combined 225/450kV microfocus X-ray and computed tomography (CT) walk-in vault
48
49 101 system at Chesapeake Testing in Belcamp, Maryland, U.S.A. Using the vault CT
50
51 102 scanner system, we collected CT slices at 0.63 mm, resulting in three-dimensional
52
53 103 reconstruction increments of 0.30 mm. We used this instrumentation to CT scan the
54
55 104 holotype of Dilophodelphis fordycei (USNM 214911), as well as specimens of
56
57 105 Squalodon calvertensis Kellogg, 1923 [13] (Squalodontidae, USNM 328343),

5
6 107 Arktocara yakataga Boersma and Pyenson, 2016 [11] (Allodelphinidae, USNM
7
8 108 214830). All platanistid taxa with enlarged supraorbital crests were also scanned for
9
10 109 finer scale comparisons, including Platanista gangetica, Pomatodelphis inaequalis
11
12 110 Allen, 1921 [15] and Zarhachis flagellator Cope, 1868 [16]. The latter two taxa were
13
14 111 scanned using a Siemens SOMATOM Emotion 6 CT scanner located at the National
15
16 112 Museum of Natural History. A Platanista specimen (USNM 23456) that we examined
17
18 113 had the left supraorbital crest separated from the skull at a clean break, which was
19
20 114 carefully fitted to the skull for scanning. The DICOM files produced from all the
21
22 115 scans were examined in ImageJ [17] and processed in Mimics (Materialise NV,
23
24 116 Leuven, Belgium) to create 3D surface models. The model of Dilophodelphis will be
25
26 117 available for viewing and download on the Smithsonian X 3D website

39 124 We tested the phylogenetic placement of Dilophodelphis using a modified version
40
41
125 of a platanistoid matrix published by Godfrey et al. [18], which was modified from
42
43
44
126 Lambert et al.’s [19] original matrix as a base. Godfrey et al.’s version consisted of 41
45
46
127 morphological characters and 21 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) including the
47
48 128 fossil platanistoid genera Huaridelphis Lambert, 2014 [19], Notocetus Moreno, 1892

5
6 134 Goedertius Kimura and Barnes, 2016 [24], Arktocara, and Otekaikea Tanaka and
7
8 135 Fordyce, 2014 [27], and removed four taxa that were not relevant for our analysis,
9
10 136 resulting in 20 OTUs. We also removed one character (character 4 in Godfrey et al.
11
12 137 [18]) that we found subjective and problematic, and added 27 morphological
13
14 138 characters, resulting in a total of 67 characters used in the analysis.

17
18 140 2.3. Functional Analysis
19
20 141 We used CT scans of extant and fossil platanistids to examine the relative bony
21
22 142 density of three regions of the skull: the rostrum, the supraorbital crests and the
23
24 143 zygomatic process. We used the “Draw profile line” function in Mimics (version 18,
25
26 144 Materialise) to collect lateral profiles in Hounsfield Units (a scale of radiodensity).
27
28 145 This method provided a way to estimate relative density within each CT scan but it
29
30 146 does not allow for density measures to be directly compared between specimens.

23 202 Holotype: USNM 214911 consists of an almost complete skull retaining both
24
25 203 periotics, but missing the tympanic bullae, the very distal tip of the rostrum (not
26
27 204 more than ~1 cm), both mandibles, fragments of the basicranium, and all dentition
28
29 205 except for a few separate teeth that were originally prepared out of the matrix by D.
30
31 206 R. Emlong. In November, 1970, Emlong collected a second specimen: both
32
33 207 mandibles of an unknown cetacean, found in a drift concretion directly in front of
34
35 208 the spot in the cliff where USNM 214911 was found. However, based on the
36
37
209 mismatched size of the mandibles relative to USNM 214911, we can definitively
38
39
40
210 exclude them from belonging to the holotype of Dilophodelphis.
41 211
42
43 212 Type Locality, Formation and Age: The holotype was recovered by Emlong in
44
45 213 December 1967. Emlong’s notes indicate the locality of Nye Beach, Oregon, USA,
46
47 214 about 0.4 km south of the Jump-Off Joe site and 0.4 km north of what was then the
48
49 215 Hotel Gilmore. Jump-Off Joe was a sea stack formation of middle Miocene
50
51 216 concretionary sandstone, located at about 44.6454° N, 124.0626° W. Hotel Gilmore,
52
53 217 originally the New Cliff House and now the Sylvia Beach Hotel, is a U.S. National
54
55 218 Register Historic Place sitting on a bluff above Nye Beach, at 44.6383° N, 124.0621°
56
57 219 W [33]. Based on Emlong’s notes, the type locality of USNM 214911 should be

5
6 221 Emlong reported that the skull was found in the Astoria Formation, a Miocene
7
8 222 marine sequence exposed along the seacliffs north and south of Yaquina Head in
9
10 223 Newport, Oregon, though Emlong did not document more specific information
11
12 224 about the stratigraphic position of the holotype. South of Yaquina Head, the lower
13
14 225 part of the formation is exposed, and is approximately 130 m thick [34]. Benthic
15
16 226 foraminifera sampled from the Astoria Formation in the Newport area were mostly
17
18 227 Saucesian in age [34] and molluscs sampled from the formation further constrain it
19
20 228 to 20.7-15.1 Ma. Molluscs specifically from the Jump-Off Joe site were early Miocene
21
22 229 in age, between 20-19 Ma. Thus, the age of the type USNM 214911 is likely between
23
24 230 ~20-19 Ma or early Miocene.

26 231
27
28 232 Differential Diagnosis:
29
30 233 Dilophodelphis is a small to medium-sized platanistoid odontocete (approximately
31
32 234 2.27 m in total length), which belongs to Platanistoidea (sensu Boersma and Pyenson
33
34 235 [11]) based on 2 synapomorphies: emargination of the posterior edge of the
35
36 236 zygomatic process by the sternomastoid muscle fossa with the skull in lateral view
37
38 237 (character 52[2]); and ventral surface of the posterior process of the periotic, concave
39
40 238 along a straight path perpendicular to its long axis (character 66[1]). Character 52
41
42 239 shows state reversals among the platanistoids. The remaining 4 platanistoid
43
44 240 synapomorphies recovered in our phylogenetic analysis are either not preserved or
45
46 241 obscured by matrix in the holotype of Dilophodelphis.
47
48 242
49 243 Dilophodelphis differs from all known Waipatiidae, Squalodelphinidae and
50
51 244 Allodelphinidae in having a distinct dorsal crest in the antorbital-supraorbital region
52
53 245 (character 8[1]); and in having a pneumatic maxillary crest overhanging medially
54
55 246 (character 48[1]). Dilophodelphis differs from waipatiids and squalodelphinids in
56
57
247 having a deeply grooved lateral rostral suture between the premaxilla and the

6 249 32[1]); in lacking cheek teeth entocingulum (character 44[1]); in having a small tooth
7
8 250 diameter as a percent of postorbital skull width (character 45[2]); in having the
9
10 251 robust and globose/rectilinear antorbital processes of the maxilla in dorsal view
11
12 252 (character 46[1]); and in having the ventral edge of the zygomatic process almost
13
14 253 straight in lateral view (character 53[1]). Dilophodelphis further differs from
15
16 254 waipatiids and allodelphinids by having an elevated antorbital region distinctly
17
18 255 higher than the dorsal margin of the rostrum base in lateral view (character 7[1]);
19
20 256 having a deep fossa in the frontal on the orbit roof at the level of the frontal groove
21
22 257 (character 12[1]); and having a circle-shaped dorsal outline of the zygomatic process
23
24 258 of the squamosal in lateral view (character 18[1]). Dilophodelphis differs from
25
26 259 waipatiids and platanistids in having a square-shaped pars cochlearis (character
27
28 260 20[1]).
29
30 261
31
32 262 Dilophodelphis also differs from the Waipatiidae in having a deep, ‘V’-shaped
33
34 263 antorbital notch in relation to an anteriorly pointed antorbital process (character
35
36 264 6[1]); having a cranium distinctly shorter than wide with a ratio <0.90 (character
37
38 265 10[1]); wide hamular fossa of the pterygoid sinus, extending anteriorly onto the
39
40 266 palatal surface of the rostrum (character 16[1]); transverse thickening of the anterior
41
42 267 process of the periotic (character 23[1]); and in having a lateral lamina of the
43
44 268 palatine (character 54[1]).
45
46
269
47 270 Dilophodelphis differs from the Allodelphinidae in lacking an elongated rostrum
48
49 271 (character 1[0]), having wide premaxillae at the rostrum base (character 4[1]), having
50
51 272 the dorsal opening of the mesorostral groove anterior to the rostrum base narrower
52
53 273 than the premaxilla (character 5[0]), having a concave lateral margin of the rostrum
54
55 274 anterior to the maxillary flange (character 41[0]), having a deep posterolateral sulcus
56
57
275 (character 47[0]), having a shallow premaxillary cleft (character 50[2]); and having the

9 279 Dilophodelphis differs from all other known platanistids in having an enlarged
10
11 280 tympanosquamosal recess forming a large triangular fossa medial and anteromedial
12
13 281 to the postglenoid process (character 55[2]). Finally, Dilophodelphis demonstrates
14
15 282 the following apomorphies: deep, ‘V’-shaped antorbital notch in relation to an
16
17 283 anteriorly pointed antorbital process (character 6[1]); semi-circular dorsal outline of
18
19 284 the zygomatic process of the squamosal in lateral view (character 18[1]); pars
20
21
285 cochlearis of the periotic square-shaped in ventral view (character 20[1]); and deep

29 289 Etymology:
30
31 290 The species epithet honors Professor R. Ewan Fordyce FRSNZ, native New Zealander
32
33 291 and prominent vertebrate paleontologist, whose extensive and long-lasting
34
35 292 contributions to the field of marine mammal paleontology, including his
36
37 293 commitment to mentoring future scientists, especially shaped the career paths of the
38
39 294 authors herein. The epithet also honors Fordyce’s long-standing interest in the fossil
40
41 295 marine mammal record of Oregon, which has yielded pivotal specimens for over a
42
43 296 century, including specimens such as Simocetus rayi Fordyce 2002 [35], which he
44
45 297 described.

52 301 The following outlines the key features of the holotype, with terminology following
53
54 302 Mead and Fordyce [36]; for all measurements of the skull, see Table 1. The skull is

3
4 304 very distal tip of the rostrum (likely no more than a couple centimeters), the lower
5
6 305 jaws, the tympanic bullae, and fragments of the basicranium (Figures 1-5). Several
7
8 306 teeth were found in the surrounding matrix, but none were retained in the rostrum
9
10 307 itself (Figure 5). Also found separated from the skull were the left nasal and an
11
12 308 isolated fragment of the left paroccipital process. The entire skull is asymmetrically
13
14 309 skewed in a variety of different ways. While the asymmetry in the facial region is
15
16 310 likely real, based on comparison with other plantanistoids, the asymmetrical skew of
17
18 311 the rostrum from the sagittal plane is likely attributable to diagenesis.
19
20 312
21
313 Dorsal view
22
23
24
314 The rostrum is practically complete, missing 1 cm from the distal end at most, and
25
26
315 moderate in length, measuring approximately 28.3 cm from the anterior tip to the
27
28 316 right antorbital notch (Figures 1-3). Anteriorly, the left and right premaxillae remain
29
30 317 in contact along the midline and roof over the mesorostral groove for approximately
31
32 318 half the rostrum length, until approximately 16.5 cm posterior of the tip, where the
33
34 319 two premaxillae separate laterally to slightly expose a narrow slit of the mesorostral
35
36 320 groove. At around the same level, the premaxillae switch from being dorsally
37
38 321 elevated above the maxillae (anterior) to being ventral of the maxillae, as the
39
40 322 maxillae rise dorsally to form a basin on the rostral base (Figure 4a). This basin
41
42 323 continues posteriorly onto the facial surface of the skull, formed ventroposteriorly by
43
44 324 the wide, flat and depressed premaxillae and laterally by the elevated supraorbital
45
46 325 crests composed of maxillae and frontals. The elevated supraorbital crests extend
47
48 326 anteroposteriorly from the antorbital process to a level between the postorbital
49
50 327 process and the nuchal crest (Figure 3). They are robust and rounded dorsally, with
51
52 328 the maxillae forming the medial face and the frontal forming the lateral face. The
53
54 329 premaxillae continue to widen transversely from the rostral base to approximately
55
56 330 the level of the postorbital processes, at which point they maintain a regular width

3
4 331 until the level of the external nares (Figure 1). Heading posteriorly from the external
5
6 332 nares towards the vertex, the premaxillae contact transversely and rise dorsally
7
8 333 above the maxillae once again. Both premaxillae are asymmetrically skewed to the
9
10 334 left, with the right one possessing a distinct premaxillary crest raised along its
11
12 335 posterolateral edge. The external bony nares are obscured by matrix, but are small
13
14 336 and appear to be oriented slightly posterior of vertical. The left nasal is disassociated
15
16 337 from the skull, but it likely was in contact medially with the right nasal, which is
17
18 338 roughly square in dorsal view, and rests on the vertex in a fossa of the frontal. The
19
20 339 left, disassociated nasal is thicker medially, narrowing in dorsoventral depth laterally.
21
22 340 The right nasal is separated from the premaxilla by a small exposure of frontal,
23
24 341 possibly due to breakage of the lateral edge of the nasal. The frontals are barely
25
26 342 exposed on the vertex, as an anteroposteriorly narrow rectangle between the nasals
27
28 343 and the nuchal crest. The vertex is dorsally elevated to the level of the nuchal crest,
29
30
344 and the temporal fossa are obscured in dorsal view by the laterally extended
31
32
345 temporal crest formed by maxilla and frontal.
33
34 346
35
36 347 Lateral view
37
38 348 In lateral view, the supraorbital crest is at the same dorsal height as the nuchal crest,
39
40 349 and is convex dorsally along both its dorsal and ventral margins (Figure 3). The
41
42 350 posteroventral margin of the crest, posterior of the postorbital process, is almost in
43
44 351 contact with the anterodorsal edge of the zygomatic process of the squamosal,
45
46 352 separated only by a thin layer of matrix. The zygomatic process is very robust,
47
48 353 roughly rectangular and pointed anterodorsally, with a rounded off postglenoid
49
50 354 process and nearly straight ventral edge. The temporal fossa is laterally convex, and
51
52 355 roughly shaped like a spear tip, with a narrowly pointed anterior margin and a
53
54 356 shallowly pointed posterior margin. Both lacrimals are present, and appear to
55
56 357 compose the ventral edge of the antorbital process and notch, though this area is

4 358 somewhat obscured by the matrix supporting the thin, delicate jugals which extend

7
360
8
9 361 Posterior view
10
11 362 In posterior view, the supraoccipital shield forms a broadly pentagonal shape, with a
12
13 363 transverse constriction dorsal to the level of the occipital condyles exposing the
14
15 364 temporal fossa (Figure 4c). Though the shield is generally posteriorly convex, there
16
17 365 are deep fossa immediately posterior to the nuchal crest, as well as shallower fossa
18
19 366 medial to the transverse constriction. The exoccipitals also bear deep dorsal
20
21
367 condyloid fossa, with the squamosal widely exposed lateral of the exoccipitals in
22
23
24
368 posterior view. The occipital condyles are posteriorly pedestaled, and their surfaces
25
26
369 are pitted, suggested that the specimen may be physically immature. The jugular
27
28 370 notch is deep and narrow, associated with a robust paroccipital process representing
29
30 371 the ventral-most part of the skull.
31 372
32
33 373 Ventral view
34
35 374 In ventral view, the rostral maxilla bears two deep grooves medial to the alveolar
36
37 375 groove on either side, reaching from the rostral tip to approximately 17.5 cm
38
39 376 posterior (Figure 2). A third groove runs down the midline of the rostrum where the
40
41 377 maxillae come into contact, widening approximately at the same level 17.5 cm
42
43 378 posterior of the rostral tip to expose a long, thin section of the vomer. From the
44
45 379 base of the rostrum to the anterior basicranium, the vomer rises as a ventrally
46
47 380 pointed keel down the midline of the skull, flanked on either side anterior to the
48
49 381 external bony nares by the medial lamina of the pterygoids, and further anterior by
50
51 382 the palatines, which are broken to expose the anterior pterygoid sinus fossa. This
52
53 383 fossa is shallow and extremely elongated anteriorly, reaching at least 10 cm in
54
55 384 anteroposterior length. The palatines border this fossa laterally, forming lateral
56
57
385 lamina that extend from the palate posteriorly to contact the falciform process of

2
3
4 386 the squamosal. The maxilla also contributes to this lateral lamina, dorsolateral to the
5
6 387 palatine. The orbital roof, formed by the frontal, is deeply excavated by a round
7
8 388 fossa for the pterygoid sinus, posteriorly bordered by a thick infratemporal crest. The
9
10 389 glenoid fossa on the zygomatic process is relatively shallow, though the
11
12 390 posterolateral edge of the zygomatic process extends anteriorly and there is a deep,
13
14 391 triangular tympanosquamosal recess. The basioccipital crests are thick and wavy
15
16 392 (potentially because of diagenetic deformation), oriented at a shallow angle from the
17
18 393 sagittal plane and ventrolaterally tilted to overhang the periotic fossa, in ventral
19
20 394 view.
21
22 395
23
24
396 Dentition
25
26
397 Though the anterior alveoli are somewhat damaged and obscured by matrix, there
27
28 398 were likely approximately 35 teeth per tooth row in the rostrum. No teeth remain in
29
30 399 the alveoli, though a number were found in the surrounding matrix and two teeth
31
32 400 are still stuck to the left glenoid fossa by matrix. These teeth are homodont, with the
33
34 401 longest 2.1 cm in length, and are extremely delicate, with a pointed with a cusp on a
35
36 402 crown approximately 0.6 cm in height that has extremely fine (if any) striae.
37 403
38
39 404 Periotics
40
41 405 Both periotic remain in situ, and are so closely appressed to the squamosal to
42
43 406 prevent removal. However, it can still be observed that they have a squared pars
44
45 407 cochlearis, robust anterior process, and posterior process with a smooth posterior
46
47 408 bullar facet. They also both have large, dorsally oriented apertures for the cochlear
48
49 409 aqueduct.

21
22 423
23
424 The phylogenetic analysis, conducted in PAUP, resulted in 65 most parsimonious
24
25
26
425 trees, with a best score of 149, consistency index of 0.57 and retention index of
27
28 426 0.714. The strict consensus tree resolved a node-based Platanistoidea including
29
30 427 Waipatia, Otekaikea, Ninjadelphis, Goedertius, Arktocara, Allodelphis, Zarhinocetus,
31
32 428 Araeodelphis, Platanista, Dilophodelphis, Pomatodelphis, Zarhachis, Phocageneus,
33
34 429 Medocinia, Squalodelphis, Notocetus, and Huaridelphis. In our results, we resolved
35
36 430 previously supported clades of Allodelphinidae, Squalodelphinidae and Platanistidae
37
38 431 (see Boersma and Pyenson [11]), with Squalodelphinidae and Platanistidae as sister
39
40 432 groups. Dilophodelphis is placed in a polytomy with Platanista and the clade of
41
42 433 Pomatodelphis+Zarhachis, with Araeodelphis as the most basal lineage in this clade
43
44 434 of Platanistidae. Our analysis yields moderate support for the monophyly of
45
46 435 Allodelphinidae and Squalodelphinidae (decay indices 2, bootstrap >40), with lower
47
48 436 support for the clades of Platanistoidea (decay index 2, bootstrap 25) and
49
50 437 Platanistidae (decay index 1, bootstrap 44).

4 442 Our first step to characterizing platanistoid facial crests involved determining what
5
6 443 cranial elements contributed to the overall composition of the crests in different taxa
7
8 444 (Figure 6). In all cases, the crests are composed of either maxillae, frontals, or both.
9
10 445 In basal branching platanistoids (i.e., waipatiids, squalodontids and allodelphinids),
11
12 446 which exhibited little to no enlargement of the supraorbital crests, the supraorbital
13
14 447 region is composed of relatively equal parts of the frontal and overlying maxillae.
15
16 448 This ratio also holds true for squalodelphinids, which show some enlargement of the
17
18 449 crests, but with the maxillae still completely overlying the frontals. The platanistid
19
20 450 Araeodelphis shows a crest condition more similar to the squalodelphinids, with
21
22 451 modest crest enlargement and maxillae overlying the frontals. However, in
23
24 452 platanistid taxa such as Pomatodelphis, Zarhachis, and Dilophodelphis, with enlarged
25
26 453 crests, they are composed of frontals on the lateral faces and maxillae on the medial
27
28 454 faces. These two cranial elements meet along the dorsal ridge of each crest, at an
29
30
455 indistinct suture. Platanista is the only platanistoid where the crests are composed
31
32
456 exclusively of maxilla. In the case of Platanista, the maxilla has extended dorsally and
33
34
35
457 separated into two thin laminae, separated by trabeculae and curving medially to
36
37
458 wrap around the melon [7].
38 459
39
40 460 b. Asymmetry
41
42 461 Another changing morphological characteristic to note among platanistoids is the
43
44 462 varying asymmetry in the skull (Figure 6). Facial asymmetry, focused around the
45
46 463 narial passages, is typical in odontocete skulls, with multiple proposed functions
47
48 464 including a roll in sound production, and an adaptation to protect the respiratory
49
50 465 tract while swallowing large prey items whole [38,39,40]. In platanistoids, this skull
51
52 466 asymmetry extends to the facial crests, and in varying degrees among different
53
54 467 putative clades. In squalodontids and allodelphinids, the skulls and supraorbital area
55
56 468 are only slightly asymmetrical, but in squalodelphinids and Araeodelphis both the

3
4 469 relative size and position of the bilateral skull elements are strongly skewed
5
6 470 sinistrally. Cranial asymmetry is even more extreme remaining platanistids, especially
7
8 471 in Dilophodelphis and Platanista, where the left supraorbital crest extends much
9
10 472 further anteriorly than the right, and many of both right and left vertex elements are
11
12 473 completely skewed beyond a midline plane created by the underlying hemispheres
13
14 474 of the neurocranium.
15
16 475
17 476 c. Crest internal surface shape
18
19 477 We examined the shape of the crests of Dilophodelphis relative to other platanistids
20
21
478 (excluding Araeodelphis, whose crest condition is more similar to that of
22
23
24
479 squalodelphinids). Assuming that elaborate crests are involved in sound production
25
26
480 and propagation during echolocation, we proposed that the internal surface would
27
28 481 contribute to reflecting sound waves generated by the phonic lips, which are
29
30 482 dorsomedial of the crests. We observed that the crests and the corresponding air
31
32 483 sacs of Platanista are unique among platanistoids (and all fossil and living
33
34 484 odontocetes) in having inward crest surfaces that are parabolic, opening ventrally
35
36 485 (Supplementary Figure 1). In contrast, the medial surfaces of the crests in
37
38 486 Pomatodelphis and Zarhachis are almost vertical, and in Dilophodelphis they are
39
40 487 parabolic again, but opening dorsally. Basic acoustic principles suggest a differential
41
42 488 function to the reflective properties of concave versus convex surface [41]. Convex
43
44 489 surfaces (e.g., the medial crest surface in Dilophodelphis) distribute reflected sound
45
46 490 much more widely than concave surfaces (e.g., Platanista’s crest surface), especially
47
48 491 at high-frequencies. Concave surfaces tend to concentrate reflected sound. As a
49
50 492 result, if both supraorbital crests participate in sound production/propagation for
51
52 493 platanistoids, the range of surface concavity/convexity and orientation would
53
54 494 produce very different results for sound propagation in the head. Lastly, we note
55
56 495 that the ventromedial surface of the crests of Platanista is highly rugose, a

3
4 496 characteristic that would also influence the reflective properties of the crests. More
5
6 497 complex surfaces provide a relatively larger surface for sound interact with, and thus
7
8 498 function better as sound absorbers and sound diffusers than as sound reflectors
9
10 499 [42].
11
12 500
13 501 d. Crest density
14
15 502 We quantified cross-sectional density of the facial crests relative to the rostrum and
16
17 503 the zygomatic process, the latter which we used as a consistent comparative
18
19 504 baseline. In all three platanistoids for which this comparison could be made
20
21
505 (Dilophodelphis fordycei, Platanista gangetica and Pomatodelphis inaequalis), we
22
23
24
506 determined that the crests and the rostrum shared similar high densities, while the
25
26
507 zygomatic process was considerably less dense. The crests of Dilophodelphis are
27
28 508 slightly more relatively dense compared to the other two species (Figure 8).
29 509
30
31 510 e. Relative size
32
33 511 We determined the relative supraorbital crest size by measuring the greatest height
34
35 512 of the crest, and calculated it as a percentage of bizygomatic width. Bizygomatic
36
37 513 width has been upheld as the most reliable proxy for condylobasal length, and was
38
39 514 used because many of the fossil skulls used are fragmentary [37]. Platanista has by
40
41 515 far the largest supraorbital crests, measuring 58% of bizygomatic width.
42
43 516 Dilophodelphis has the next largest crests, at only 28% of bizygomatic width.
44
45 517
46
518 f. Pneumatization
47
48
519 We used CT data to determine whether there was any evidence of pneumatization in
49
50
51
520 the supraorbital crests of platanistoids other than Platanista. The three basal-most
52
53 521 platanistoid scanned (Squalodon, Arktocara, and Phocageneus) showed no
54
55 522 pneumatization of the crests. Cross-sectional CT scans at the level just anterior to
56
57 523 the antorbital notch in these taxa showed that the supraorbital area is composed of
58
59
60
19
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 20 of 54

2
3
4 524 solid bone. The modest supraorbital eminences in Araeodelphis appear to be devoid
5
6 525 of pneumatization, based on the observations made by Godfrey et al. [18]. In the
7
8 526 referred specimen of Araeodelphis (USNM 10478), the pterygoid sinus excavates a
9
10 527 deep fossa on the ventral surface of the frontal reaching to the outer margin of the
11
12 528 orbit roof, but it does not penetrate and open onto the dorsal side of the skull.
13
14 529 However, all other members of the clade Platanistidae (i.e., except Araeodelphis)
15
16 530 demonstrate some evidence pneumatization, though in different ways. As previously
17
18 531 stated, the crests of Platanista are composed of two maxillary laminae, joined by
19
20 532 trabeculae and invaded by air spaces of the pterygoid air sac system [7]. The CT
21
22 533 scans of Pomatodelphis showed that the crest has an air pocket in-tucking from the
23
24 534 ventral side. The slightly crushed appearance of the medial surface of facial crests in
25
26 535 nearly every specimen of Pomatodelphis suggests that, in life, the medial crest
27
28 536 surfaces were likely fenestrated by a thin margin of bone. However, it is possible
29
30
537 that these air pockets communicated openly with soft anatomy of the facial region
31
32
538 in a novel way (among odontocetes). Dilophodelphis showed less obvious
33
34
35
539 pneumatization, but cross-sectional scans of the crests were patched with dark
36
37
540 shadows, either representing pneumatic spaces filled with matrix, or areas of lower
38
39 541 density bone that could be precursors to pneumatic spaces.

43

45
46 545 4.1. Morphological comparisons
47
546
48
49 547 Facial crests are common traits in the supraorbital region of odontocetes ([36]: table
50
51 548 1), yet their disparate composition and placement challenges interpretations of their
52
53 549 homology and function. Among platanistoids, supraorbital crests are most evident
54
55 550 among two nominal groups: squalodelphinids and platanistids. Allodelphinids and
56
57 551 waipatiids show supraorbital crests generally on par with other delphinoids ([36]: fig

2
3
4 552 1), whereas the thickness and topography of supraorbital crests in squalodelphinids
5
6 553 and platanistids are distinctive features of the facial region. Squalodelphinids show
7
8 554 no evidence of pneumatization of the supraorbital crests, and this also holds true for
9
10 555 Araeodelphis. Though a phylogenetically a platanistid, Araeodelphis has crests only
11
12 556 slightly more enlarged than squalodelphinid. Platanista possesses the largest
13
14 557 supraorbital crests of any platanistoid, based on pure linear morphometrics, with
15
16 558 those of Dilophodelphis ranking second in size, and Zarhachis close behind.
17
18 559 Compositionally, the crests in Platanista are composed solely of the maxillae, which
19
20 560 is unique among platanistoids—all others have crests composed of both the
21
22 561 maxillae and frontals. The supraorbital crests of Dilophodelphis, Pomatodelphis and
23
24 562 Zarhachis are composed of relatively equal surfaces of the frontals and maxillae, with
25
26 563 the maxillae forming the internal surfaces and the frontals forming the exterior
27
28 564 surfaces (Figure 6). Internally, there are clear indications that all the platanistids,
29
30
565 excluding Araeodelphis, show some degree of pneumatization in the supraorbital
31
32
566 crests. Any future studies to test the role of Platanista’s supraorbital crests in sound
33
34
35
567 production should take into consideration all the crest characteristics outlined above,
36
37
568 and how they have changed phylogenetically and through geologic time.
38 569
39
40 570 Enlarged, crest-like features in the supraorbital and antorbital region are not unique
41
42 571 to the platanistoids. Among the odontocetes, several other groups exhibit crest-like
43
44 572 features, with the most enlarged forms present in the extant species. Among these
45
46 573 groups are the other river dolphin genera (Inia and Pontoporia), the physeteroids
47
48 574 (Physeter and Kogia), delphinids (Tursiops) and ziphiids (Mesoplodon and
49
50 575 Hyperoodon) However, the nomenclature and homology of these facial crests have
51
52 576 been confused and debated for centuries. In their lexicon of odontocete skull
53
54 577 morphology, Mead and Fordyce [36] discriminate and elucidate these, differentiating
55
56 578 the types of crests, ridges, tubercles in the antorbital and supraorbital region; their

5

7
8 581 crest morphology among the platanistoids expands on these observations made by
9
10 582 Mead and Fordyce [36], and provides the first quantitative data describing this
11
12 583 variation in this group.
13
14 584
15
16
585 4.2. Phylogenetics
17 586
18
19 587 Our analysis supports the concept of a monophyletic Platanistoidea, which includes
20
21 588 the living Platanista, and a cluster of allied, extinct sub-clades that consist of three
22
23 589 nominal families (Allodelphinidae, Squalodelphinidae, and Platanistidae), as well as
24
25 590 Waipatia and Otekaikea, with Waipatia as the most basal lineage in the clade.
26
27 591 Platanistoidea is supported by 6 synapomorphies: emargination of the posterior
28
29 592 edge of zygomatic process by neck muscle fossae, skull in lateral view [character
30
31 593 52(1,2)]; presence of suprameatal pit of squamosal [character 57(1,2)]; presence of
32
33 594 posterior periotic fossa of squamosal [character 59(1,3)]; lateral groove or depression
34
35 595 affecting profile of periotic as viewed dorsally [character 60(1)]; Anteroposterior ridge
36
37 596 on dorsal side [character 61(1)]; ventral surface of posterior process of periotic
38
39 597 concave or convex along straight path perpendicular to its long axis [character
40
41
598 66(1,2)].
42
43 599
44
45 600 By mapping both the presence or absence of crest pneumatization and the relative
46
47 601 size of the crests onto our strict consensus phylogenetic tree, we were able to
48
49 602 visualize these traits in an evolutionary context (Figure 9). Our analysis shows that
50
51 603 both enlarged crest size and pneumatization evolved only once, and in one clade
52
53 604 (Squalodelphinidae+Platanistidae), but at different times. The enlargement of the
54
55 605 supraorbital crests began in the late Oligocene, with the Squalodelphinidae evolving
56
57 606 modest-sized crests. In the early Miocene, supraorbital crests reached extreme sizes

22
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 23 of 54 Royal Society Open Science: For review only

3
4 607 with the appearance of the platanistids. However, the Squalodelphinidae evolved
5
6 608 enlarged crests without the invasion of air sacs. Not until the early Miocene, with the
7
8 609 appearance of the platanistids and the evolution of extremely large crests, does
9
10 610 pneumatization also appear. Therefore, the evolution of pneumatization is de-
11
12 611 coupled from the enlargement of the supraorbital crests among the platanistoids.
13
14 612
15
16
613 4.3. Functional morphology
17 614
18
19 615 The morphology of Dilophodelphis raises several questions about the function of
20
21 616 supraorbital crests in platanistoids. Our only extant model for the function of
22
23 617 supraorbital crests in platanistoids is the South Asian river dolphin (Platanista
24
25 618 gangetica), whose prominent, concave crests are hypothesized to serve a role in
26
27 619 echolocation because they support maxillary sinuses that lie dorsal to the melon,
28
29 620 though experimental determination remains hard to achieve. In other odontocetes,
30
31 621 sound produced by the phonic lips is reflected or absorbed by either the sinus
32
33 622 system or the crests themselves, producing a more anteriorly projected acoustic
34
35 623 signal [43,44]. For Platanista, Pilleri [45] referred to this system as a “sound screen”
36
37 624 that prevents sound from passing dorsoventrally from the caudal half of the melon.
38
39 625 A priori we would expect that crests used to reflect sound anteriorly would have a
40
41
626 highly concave medial surface (allowing them to focus reflected sound rather than
42
43
44
627 dissipating it) and that they would be denser (which would allow for greater acoustic
45
46
628 impedance). The density and morphology of the crests in Platanista certainly meet
47
48 629 these requirements. However, the internal surface of the crests of Platanista are
49
50 630 highly convoluted, which would prevent reflection of sound and instead may allow
51
52 631 for sound to be better absorbed by the bone. Because of this, we infer that if
53
54 632 Platanista is reflecting sound anteriorly using its crests, it is probably doing so using
55
56 633 the sinuses lining the crests rather than the bone itself. More basic anatomical work

4 634 on this highly endangered taxon is necessary to refine and ground truth these
5
6 635 hypotheses.
7
636
8
9 637 The morphology of Dilophodelphis’ crests differ substantially from those of
10
11 638 Platanista. They are robust and both laterally and dorsally expanded. Their medial
12
13 639 surface is convex, a characteristic that would make it difficult for these structures to
14
15 640 focus sound in any certain direction. The density of the crests of Dilophodelphis are
16
17 641 similar in density to other platanistoids. In all species included in our analysis, the
18
19 642 crests were denser than the zygomatic process but of similar density to the rostrum.
20
21
643 The crests of Dilophodelphis are slightly denser than those of Platanista and
22
23
24
644 Pomatodelphis compared to the other regions of the skull. Unfortunately, this
25
26
645 finding may not tell us much about possible variation in crest function in these taxa
27
28 646 (Figure 8). Diagenetic processes may also influence these results and so care must
29
30 647 be taken when drawing conclusions from small differences in density. Also, it may be
31
32 648 that most of the acoustic impedance is undertaken by the maxillary sinuses rather
33
34 649 than the bone itself, and hence bone density may not be an important factor in
35
36 650 determining the performance of the system.
37 651
38
39 652 There are multiple possible functions for the large crests of Dilophodelphis. First,
40
41 653 these crests could support soft tissue structures or sinus systems in a similar way to
42
43 654 Platanista, but the relative size of the crests seems overdesigned for this purpose.
44
45 655 Without a sinus system to absorb or reflect sound, it is possible that bone needed
46
47 656 to be thicker to adequately perform the same function as a sound screen. Second,
48
49 657 crests of this size could act as protection, providing structural reinforcement for
50
51 658 loads that occur during feeding, evading predators or interspecific fighting (i.e.,
52
53 659 competition). However, it is hard to imagine a scenario where loads are applied to
54
55 660 this region of the cranium. The long slender rostrum would be more likely to
56
57
661 engage with an object rather than the dorsal surface of the head. Third, the crests

24

3
4 662 may act as display structures. Many species of odontocetes such as male beaked
5
6 663 whales possess elaborate display structures that allow for intraspecific or interspecific
7
8 664 signaling. It has even been hypothesized that odontocete species may be able to
9
10 665 sense differences in internal morphology using echolocation [46]. Lastly, the crests
11
12 666 may provide space for sinuses. Mammals have evolved, or through ontogeny,
13
14 667 develop sinus systems for a wide range of functions including weight reduction,
15
16 668 space for chamber resonance, or thermoregulation [47]. Future studies could assess
17
18 669 these hypotheses using a variety of techniques. Modelling approaches, such as finite
19
20 670 element analysis, offer a useful mechanism to test the structural, acoustic and
21
22 671 thermoregulatory benefits of different crest morphologies. Further work on the
23
24 672 function of soft tissues in the acoustic system of Platanista would also greatly
25
26 673 benefit any interpretation of crest function in fossil taxa.

Comments to the Author(s)
An important and tidy work by Boersma et al. I only had a few minor comments and editorial items
listed within the body of the marked-up PDF. Were the illustrations publication size? If so, they are so
small, a real shame that they are not larger because this is an important and lovely specimen. I think
that their conclusions are sound. Future work is also suggested; a nice addition. I look forward to the
publication.
We thank the reviewer for their comments & suggestions—all the items listed in the marked-up PDF
have been accepted and incorporated into the revised MS. The illustrations provided in the revision
process are not, to our knowledge, publication size – their small size is relatively standard for the review
process at Royal Society journals. We have provided the journal with figures at the highest-resolution
and planned size possible.

Review by O Lambert (IRSNB, Brussels)
This short paper starts with the description of a new genus and species of platanistid from the early
Miocene of the North Pacific. This type specimen is impressive and interesting for several aspects, and it
unambiguously represents a previously unknown taxon. The description is clear, but short, which is
somewhat frustrating considering the completeness of the specimen. Depending on the editorial
guidelines of RSOS, some more details could be provided, for example on the periotic. Also, although the
diagnosis is long and detailed, the absence of direct comparison with other platanistids is somewhat
surprising, and some more comments could be provided at the level of the rostrum morphology. The
illustrations of the skull are good, but again some more labels could be added, as well as detail views of
the periotic.
We thank the reviewer for his thoughtful and thorough comments, all of which have contributed to
making this a more thorough and complete manuscript. We have added text to the description section,
particularly to the description of the periotic (new figure 6), at the reviewer’s request. We also provide a
clearer detail photo and figure of the periotic, although only from the ventral view as removing the
periotic from the skull would almost certainly damage it. We did scan the periotic in situ using a
microCT, but unfortunately there was not enough differentiation between the periotic and the
surrounding matrix/bone that we could produce a clean and reliable 3D model. We have also added
more direct comparison between Dilophodelphis and other platanistids in the morphological comparisons
section of the discussion. Finally, we have added more labels to the descriptive figures (see figures 1-
5).
Considering the sample of taxa included, I would avoid discussing the content of the superfamily
Platanistoidea. Alternatively, the two hypotheses should be provided, with and without Squalodon.
Corrected.
The question of the evolution of the supraorbital crests among platanistoids is interesting and fully
relevant in this work, considering the surprisingly high crests observed in an animal otherwise more
similar to squalodelphinids than to most platanistids. The techniques used to evaluate changes in the
shape and inner structure of the crest are convincing and certainly yield to interesting results, although
some more details should be provided about the way the height of the crest is measured. You will see in
my comments below (and in the annotated ms) that I am not fully convinced by the description of a
possible degree of pneumatization in Dilophodelphis. This assertion should either be modified or
supported by further arguments. This may modify somewhat the proposed scenario for the evolution of
the crests among platanistids. Finally, you do not address the potential role of the crests in the
attachment of facial/rostral muscles. This may be taken into account, at least for the early steps of the
evolution of the crests (prior to the invasion of the facial region by the pterygoid sinus system).
We have added text on how the crests were measured in the “relative size” section of the results. We
have also clarified in the text how we are evaluating pneumatization, and have changed our stance on
the presence of pneumatization in Dilophodelphis. Finally, we have added text on the potential role of
the crests in the attachment of facial/rostral muscles. See further comments for more details on these
items.
Find below and in the annotated manuscript more detailed suggestions and comments that may improve
the quality of this interesting and well-organized work.
All of the comments in the annotated manuscript have been accepted and corrected. Other suggestions
and comments are addressed below.
- Your concept of pneumatization of the supraorbital crest may possibly benefit from some clarification. I
agree that the presence of a fossa for the orbital lobe of the pterygoid sinus is probably not a clue for
pneumatization of the crest (as in squalodelphinids). But do you consider that a deepening of the fossa
as in Pomatodelphis corresponds to pneumatization? A single fossa inside the crest is still very different
from the large extent of pneumatization along the ventromedial surface of the crest as seen in
Platanista. Furthermore, how does the fossa in Pomatodelphis differ from the fossa noted in
squalodelphinids and Araeodelphis? Additional criteria may be useful to better separate
Pomatodephis/Zarhachis from earlier branching platanistids and squalodelphinids. Depth of the fossa?
We have added a paragraph in the new discussion section “Supraorbital crests & pneumatization”
defining our concept of pneumatization and clarifying the differing degrees of pneumatization observed
among the platanistids.
- Based on figure 7, I cannot see any clue for pneumatization of the crest in Dilophodelphis. Slight
differences along the grey scale are most likely due to slight variations of bone compactness, as
observed in thick, non-osteosclerotic bones of many other odontocetes (see for example Lambert et al.
2011). Cavities would be much more conspicuous.
Lambert, O., Buffrénil, V., de, and Muizon, C., de. 2011. Rostral densification in beaked whales: diverse
processes for a similar pattern. Comptes Rendus Palevol 10: 453-468.
We agree with the reviewer, and have modified the text to reflect our opinion that Dilophodelphis
doesn’t show clear signs of pneumatization.
- On a related subject, the CT scan cross section shown for "Phocageneus" in fig. 7b seems too anterior
to allow visualizing the shallow fossa for the orbital lobe of the pterygoid sinus excavating the orbit roof.
If available, I would select a somewhat more posterior cross section that would better reflect the
condition in this squalodelphinid.
We have replaced the cross-section of USNM 475496 in this figure with one further posterior on the
skull.
- Differential diagnosis: I did not see any list of platanistid characters. This specimen is a nice
intermediary between squalodelphinids and platanistids, so it would be worth highlighting what makes a
platanistid (vs a squalodelphinid).
We have added text to the differential diagnosis outlining the characters that make Dilophodelphis a
platanistid vs. a squalodelphinid. We have also added text to the “Morphological comparisons” section
discussing platanistid vs. squalodelphinid characteristics.
- l.106: The specimen USNM 475496 is identified here as Phocageneus venustus. It was first identified
as Phocageneus, cf. P. venustus by Whitmore & Kaltenbach (2008), then identified as Squalodelphinidae
by Lambert et al. (2014). Indeed, there are no points of comparison with the type material and referred
ear bones, so it may be more careful to provide a less precise identification (at least two squalodelphinid
periotic morphotypes are identified in the Lee Creek Mine fauna). Otherwise, you may have to provide
arguments.
We appreciate these comments, and agree that a deeper discussion on Phocageneus venustus would be
warranted, but we do not think that is necessary for our manuscript. Therefore, we have opted for the
simpler solution which is to follow Lambert et al. (2014) by changing all mention of USNM 475496 to
refer to it as Squalodelphinidae gen. and sp. indet. This does not change our use of it in the paper, as it
still serves its intended purpose as a representative of the Squalodelphinidae.
- l.248: How confident are you that the 4 preserved teeth illustrated here correspond to posteriormost
teeth? Accessory denticles generally appear in the very last teeth of squalodelphinids, so detached and
relatively elongated teeth may possibly not be the best clue for coding this character here. For a
description of the shape of anterior and posterior teeth in a fossil platanistid, see Lambert et al. 2008
(no need to cite the paper, but it may be useful for comparison).
Lambert, O., Schlögl, J., and Kovác, M. 2008. Middle Miocene toothed whale with Platanista-like teeth
from the Vienna Basin (Western Carpathians, Slovakia). Neues Jahrbuch für Geologie und Paläontologie
250: 157-166.
We thank the reviewer for this observation—we cannot say for certain that the preserved teeth
correspond to posteriormost teeth, and as such have corrected the coding to reflect this helpful
comment.
- l.279: Only one difference with other platanistids is explicitly provided here. Because there is no
detailed comparison section in this work, I find it a bit frustrating not finding in the text or diagnosis
other differences, for example at the level of the rostrum length, tooth count, and rostrum cross section
shape. Differences at the level of the oral apparatus could also be included in the discussion (ecology
and feeding strategy), but this is only a suggestion.
As mentioned above, we have added text in the discussion section “Morphological comparisons,” with
more detailed comparison between Dilophodelphis and other platanistids.
- l.282: Three of the apomorphic features of Dilophodelphis (V-shaped antorbital notch, semi-circular
dorsal outline of the zygomatic process, square-shaped pars cochlearis) are shared with at least part of
the squalodelphinids. I would suggest at least adding a comment on this. Even if your phylogenetic
analysis produces such a result, there is a good chance that those are actually plesiomorphic features,
as compared to other platanistids.
We thank the reviewer for this observation, and we have clarified this in the differential diagnosis.
- Considering its high value for systematics, the description of the periotic could be somewhat expanded,
providing more details about features of the anterior and posterior bullar facets (as listed in the
diagnosis). Also, is there any indication of an articular ridge/process? The detailed paper by Muizon
(1987) could be cited (only a suggestion).
Muizon, C., de. 1987. The affinities of Notocetus vanbenedeni, an Early Miocene platanistoid (Cetacea
Mammalia) from Patagonia, southern Argentina. American Museum Novitates 2904: 1-27.
We agree. We have expanded the periotic description as requested, and added a new figure focused on
describing the periotic (new figure 6).
- l.426: I would suggest placing the strict consensus tree before figure 6, which is only a simplified
version of the tree.
Done.
- l.469-470: In squalodelphinids, asymmetry is also present at the level of the antorbital notches and
premaxillae at rostrum base. See Lambert et al. 2014.
Noted, and added to the text.
- l.502: You mention that you compare density of the facial crest to density of the rostrum. It should be
noted that different bones of the rostrum (or parts of them) often display significant differences in
compactness. For example, the porcelanous part of the premaxilla is often much more compact (see
Mead & Fordyce, 2009; Lambert et al. 2011). So taking the rostrum as a whole may possibly not be the
best choice (or some rephrasing could be useful). In figure 8a, it seems that the densest bone on the
rostrum is indeed the premaxilla.
Lambert, O., Buffrénil, V., de, and Muizon, C., de. 2011. Rostral densification in beaked whales: diverse
processes for a similar pattern. Comptes Rendus Palevol 10: 453-468.
Here we sampled bone density in the lower (more ventral) sections of the rostrum to avoid the influence
of the denser premaxillae. We have modified the text of the manuscript to explain this, and figure 8 has
been modified to more specifically show the sections of the skull that were sampled.
- l.511: It would be useful to precise here and in the supplementary table how the maximum height of
the crest is measured (from the orbit roof? from the approximate dorsal surface of the non-thickened
part of the maxilla + frontal?). If you measure the height of the crest from the ventral surface of the
orbit roof, it implies that the fossa for the frontal lobe of the pterygoid sinus of squalodelphinids invades
the crest.
We have added this text to the revisions (see Results 3.5.e. “Relative size”).
- l.532: 'invaded by air spaces of the pterygoid air sac system': It would be great to highlight the
connection between the pterygoid sinus system and the air spaces on the ventromedial surface of the
crest of Platanista. Maybe with arrows and possibly a cross section at a different level.
Done. This has been added to figure 7, where the connection is now circled.
- l.533: 'air pocket in-tucking from the ventral side': I guess that this corresponds to a deeper fossa for
the orbital lobe of the pterygoid sinus as compared to squalodelphinids and Araeodelphis. It would be
helpful reminding this here. The homology of the fossa in the orbit of squalodelphinids with the deeper
fossa in Pomatodelphis has bee proposed by Lambert et al. (2014, p. 995) and Bianucci et al. (2015, p.
7).
Bianucci, G., Urbina, M., and Lambert, O. 2015. A new record of Notocetus vanbenedeni
(Squalodelphinidae, Odontoceti, Cetacea) from the early Miocene of Peru. Comptes Rendus Palevol 14:
5-13.
Noted. This clarification has been added to the text, and the references have also been added.
- l.538: 'in a novel way (among odontocetes)': How does such a potential communication differ from the
connection in Platanista? Would'nt it be homologous?
We appreciate the suggestion and we have modified the revised text. See Results 3.5.f.
“Pneumatization.”
- l.538-541: 'less obvious pneumatization': see comment above about the possible absence of
pneumatization in Dilophodelphis. I do not think that areas of lower density could be seen as an
intermediary stage between no pneumatization and pneumatization, and I would suggest modifying
figure 6 for the status of Dilophodelphis.
OK, we have modified our discussion about pneumatization, including a new character state to
accommodate the observations of Dilophodelphis. We agree with the reviewer, and have modified the
text here to agree with this stance. Figure 6 (now figure 8) has been modified.
- l.554-563: This part mostly includes observations and partly repeats elements of part 3.5.a (cranial
elements). I would move all these elements in the paragraph 3.5.a, where they could be merged with
existing parts.
While we appreciate the reviewer’s opinion, we think it is important at this point in the paper to briefly
synthesize the results discussed in part 3.5.a (and the following sections). We elect to keep this text
here.
- l.587-590: 'Our analysis supports the concept of a monoplyletic Platanistoidea...': On which argument
did you base your decision to exclude Squalodon from Platanistoidea? I am afraid that the sample of
taxa included here is too narrow to allow testing the content of the superfamily, considering that no
delphinidan, ziphiid or physeteroid is included. I would suggest to only focus on homodont platanistoid
subclades.
We have modified our phylogenetics discussion to include mention of both options for a monophyletic
Platanistoidea: both with and without Squalodon, though the version without Squalodon has slightly
higher support in our analysis.
- Functional morphology: There is only one specimen of Dilophodelphis described, so we cannot have an
idea about intraspecific variation at the level of the development of crests. But because crests have been
demonstrated (1) to grow during ontogeny and (2) to be highly sexually dimorphic in several ziphiids
(see Hyperoodon), it may be worth commenting on intraspecific variation at this level in Platanista
(based on literature). Based on the results of such a research, it may be worth commenting on the
possibility for the crests of Dilophodelphis to have been sexually dimorphic. Also, if the holotype is an
immature individual (as proposed by the authors), even larger crests could be expected in older
specimens. This is only a suggestion.
We have added a short paragraph in the discussion on the possibility of intraspecific variation inferred
from living species.
- Figures: In general the illustrations of the skull are of good quality, and the combination of a photo
with a second photo with an opacity mask is fine. However, I would have expected many more labels, at
least for elements described in the diagnosis and text. See comments on the annotated pdf.
More labels have been added to the figures, including all diagnostic features.
- Figure 5: Enlarged views of the periotic would be useful, especially one in the conventional ventral
view of the bone.
An additional figure has been added with an enlarged view of the periotic in ventral view, the only view
available given its position in the skull. We think these illustrations address this issue.
- Suplemental figure 1: Parts d and e are slightly misleading. This looks like sounds come from one
direction and are reflected in that same direction. In Platanista, the phonic lips are posterodorsal and the
sounds are transmitted anteroventrally. It may be needed to illustrate this with a more tangential
reflextion of sound. Otherwise, some more words of explanation would be useful.
We thank the reviewer for this observation, and have modified the caption of the figure to clarify that
parts d and e are simple representations of the reflective properties of concave vs. convex surfaces, and
are not representative of the specific directional reflective properties of the supraorbital crests. The
directional reflection of the crests in platanistoids is very complex, including both hard and soft tissue
structures (for which we have limited data) and is beyond the scope of this paper (and certainly this
figure).

10 Dear Dr. Padian,
11
12 Subject Editor, Royal Society Open Science
13
14
15 We would like to re-submit the following revised manuscript entitled, “A new fossil dolphin
16 Dilophodelphis fordycei provides insight into the evolution of supraorbital crests in
17
18 Platanistoidea (Mammalia, Cetacea),” for consideration in the journal Royal Society Open
19 Science.
20
21
22 In this manuscript, we present the description of a new genus and species of fossil dolphin,
23
24 Dilophodelphis fordycei, from the Miocene Astoria Formation of Oregon. Phylogenetic analysis
25
shows that this new taxon belongs to a once cosmopolitan marine group of cetaceans,
26
27 Platanistoidea. Today this clade is only represented by one living member, the endangered South
28
29
Asian river dolphin (Platanista gangetica), which possesses thin and pneumatized bony crests on
30 its skull unlike any other cetacean. To better understand the evolutionary origin of these crests in
31
32 this lineage, we analyzed the morphological pattern of crest enlargement and pneumatization
33 among the platanistoids, focusing on the taxa most closely related to Platanista (including
34
35 Dilophodelphis). Our manuscript shows that crest enlargement and pneumatization occurred at
36 different times in the evolutionary history of platanistoids. We also present hypotheses for how
37
38 different variations in crest morphology and composition would have differential function for
39 sounds propagation in echolocation.
40
41
42
This paper will interest the broad readership of Royal Society Open Science for several reasons.
43
44 First, the topical relevance of cetacean evolution – especially the description of a novel species –
45
46
already has textbook-level appeal to a cross-section of organismal biologists, including
47 evolutionary and ecological ones. The close phylogenetic relation of this new species to the
48
49 highly endangered South Asian river dolphin will appeal to conservation biologists as well.
50 Pending acceptance, we will supply a 3D model of the holotype specimen, as well as a 3D model
51
52 of Platanista, which will be accessible on the Smithsonian X 3D website in an open-access
53 framework, heightening its visibility. Finally, our investigation into the pattern of facial crest
54
55 development and pneumatization in platanistoids will interest functional morphologists studying
56 the evolution of elaborate structures, and the relationship between soft and bony tissues.

38 We thank the reviewer for his thoughtful and thorough comments, all of which have contributed to making this a
39 more thorough and complete manuscript. We have added text to the description section, particularly to the
40 description of the periotic (new figure 6), at the reviewer’s request. We also provide a clearer detail photo and figure
41 of the periotic, although only from the ventral view as removing the periotic from the skull would almost certainly
42 damage it. We did scan the periotic in situ using a microCT, but unfortunately there was not enough differentiation
43 between the periotic and the surrounding matrix/bone that we could produce a clean and reliable 3D model. We have
44 also added more direct comparison between Dilophodelphis and other platanistids in the morphological comparisons
45
section of the discussion. Finally, we have added more labels to the descriptive figures (see figures 1-5).
46
47
48 Considering the sample of taxa included, I would avoid discussing the content of the superfamily Platanistoidea.
49 Alternatively, the two hypotheses should be provided, with and without Squalodon.
50
51 Corrected.
52
53 The question of the evolution of the supraorbital crests among platanistoids is interesting and fully relevant in this
54 work, considering the surprisingly high crests observed in an animal otherwise more similar to squalodelphinids than
55 to most platanistids. The techniques used to evaluate changes in the shape and inner structure of the crest are
56 convincing and certainly yield to interesting results, although some more details should be provided about the way
57 the height of the crest is measured. You will see in my comments below (and in the annotated ms) that I am not fully

3 convinced by the description of a possible degree of pneumatization in Dilophodelphis. This assertion should either
4
be modified or supported by further arguments. This may modify somewhat the proposed scenario for the evolution
5
of the crests among platanistids. Finally, you do not address the potential role of the crests in the attachment of
6
facial/rostral muscles. This may be taken into account, at least for the early steps of the evolution of the crests (prior
7
8 to the invasion of the facial region by the pterygoid sinus system).
9
10 We have added text on how the crests were measured in the “relative size” section of the results. We have also
11 clarified in the text how we are evaluating pneumatization, and have changed our stance on the presence of
12 pneumatization in Dilophodelphis. Finally, we have added text on the potential role of the crests in the attachment of
13 facial/rostral muscles. See further comments for more details on these items.
14
15 Find below and in the annotated manuscript more detailed suggestions and comments that may improve the quality
16 of this interesting and well-organized work.
17
18 All of the comments in the annotated manuscript have been accepted and corrected. Other suggestions and
19
comments are addressed below.
20
21
- Your concept of pneumatization of the supraorbital crest may possibly benefit from some clarification. I agree that
22
23 the presence of a fossa for the orbital lobe of the pterygoid sinus is probably not a clue for pneumatization of the crest
24 (as in squalodelphinids). But do you consider that a deepening of the fossa as in Pomatodelphis corresponds to
25 pneumatization? A single fossa inside the crest is still very different from the large extent of pneumatization along the
26 ventromedial surface of the crest as seen in Platanista. Furthermore, how does the fossa in Pomatodelphis differ from
27 the fossa noted in squalodelphinids and Araeodelphis? Additional criteria may be useful to better separate
28 Pomatodephis/Zarhachis from earlier branching platanistids and squalodelphinids. Depth of the fossa?
29
30 We have added a paragraph in the new discussion section “Supraorbital crests & pneumatization” defining our
31 concept of pneumatization and clarifying the differing degrees of pneumatization observed among the platanistids.
32
33 - Based on figure 7, I cannot see any clue for pneumatization of the crest in Dilophodelphis. Slight differences along
34
the grey scale are most likely due to slight variations of bone compactness, as observed in thick, non-osteosclerotic
35
bones of many other odontocetes (see for example Lambert et al. 2011). Cavities would be much more conspicuous.
36

38 a similar pattern. Comptes Rendus Palevol 10: 453-468.
39
40 We agree with the reviewer, and have modified the text to reflect our opinion that Dilophodelphis doesn’t show clear
41 signs of pneumatization.
42
43 - On a related subject, the CT scan cross section shown for "Phocageneus" in fig. 7b seems too anterior to allow
44 visualizing the shallow fossa for the orbital lobe of the pterygoid sinus excavating the orbit roof. If available, I would
45 select a somewhat more posterior cross section that would better reflect the condition in this squalodelphinid.
46
47 We have replaced the cross-section of USNM 475496 in this figure with one further posterior on the skull.
48
49
- Differential diagnosis: I did not see any list of platanistid characters. This specimen is a nice intermediary between
50
squalodelphinids and platanistids, so it would be worth highlighting what makes a platanistid (vs a squalodelphinid).
51
52
53 We have added text to the differential diagnosis outlining the characters that make Dilophodelphis a platanistid vs. a
54 squalodelphinid. We have also added text to the “Morphological comparisons” section discussing platanistid vs.
55 squalodelphinid characteristics.
56
57 - l.106: The specimen USNM 475496 is identified here as Phocageneus venustus. It was first identified as
58
59
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 5 of 62 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 Phocageneus, cf. P. venustus by Whitmore & Kaltenbach (2008), then identified as Squalodelphinidae by Lambert et
4
al. (2014). Indeed, there are no points of comparison with the type material and referred ear bones, so it may be more
5
careful to provide a less precise identification (at least two squalodelphinid periotic morphotypes are identified in the
6
Lee Creek Mine fauna). Otherwise, you may have to provide arguments.
7
8
9 We appreciate these comments, and agree that a deeper discussion on Phocageneus venustus would be warranted, but
10 we do not think that is necessary for our manuscript. Therefore, we have opted for the simpler solution which is to
11 follow Lambert et al. (2014) by changing all mention of USNM 475496 to refer to it as Squalodelphinidae gen. and sp.
12 indet. This does not change our use of it in the paper, as it still serves its intended purpose as a representative of the
13 Squalodelphinidae.
14
15 - l.248: How confident are you that the 4 preserved teeth illustrated here correspond to posteriormost teeth?
16 Accessory denticles generally appear in the very last teeth of squalodelphinids, so detached and relatively elongated
17 teeth may possibly not be the best clue for coding this character here. For a description of the shape of anterior and
18 posterior teeth in a fossil platanistid, see Lambert et al. 2008 (no need to cite the paper, but it may be useful for
19
comparison).

21
Vienna Basin (Western Carpathians, Slovakia). Neues Jahrbuch für Geologie und Paläontologie 250: 157-166.
22
23
24 We thank the reviewer for this observation—we cannot say for certain that the preserved teeth correspond to
25 posteriormost teeth, and as such have corrected the coding to reflect this helpful comment.
26
27 - l.279: Only one difference with other platanistids is explicitly provided here. Because there is no detailed
28 comparison section in this work, I find it a bit frustrating not finding in the text or diagnosis other differences, for
29 example at the level of the rostrum length, tooth count, and rostrum cross section shape. Differences at the level of
30 the oral apparatus could also be included in the discussion (ecology and feeding strategy), but this is only a suggestion.
31
32 As mentioned above, we have added text in the discussion section “Morphological comparisons,” with more detailed
33 comparison between Dilophodelphis and other platanistids.
34
35
- l.282: Three of the apomorphic features of Dilophodelphis (V-shaped antorbital notch, semi-circular dorsal outline
36
37 of the zygomatic process, square-shaped pars cochlearis) are shared with at least part of the squalodelphinids. I would
38 suggest at least adding a comment on this. Even if your phylogenetic analysis produces such a result, there is a good
39 chance that those are actually plesiomorphic features, as compared to other platanistids.
40
41 We thank the reviewer for this observation, and we have clarified this in the differential diagnosis.
42
43 - Considering its high value for systematics, the description of the periotic could be somewhat expanded, providing
44 more details about features of the anterior and posterior bullar facets (as listed in the diagnosis). Also, is there any
45 indication of an articular ridge/process? The detailed paper by Muizon (1987) could be cited (only a suggestion).

48
49
We agree. We have expanded the periotic description as requested, and added a new figure focused on describing the
50
periotic (new figure 6).
51
52
53 - l.426: I would suggest placing the strict consensus tree before figure 6, which is only a simplified version of the tree.
54
55 Done.

- l.469-470: In squalodelphinids, asymmetry is also present at the level of the antorbital notches and premaxillae at
5
rostrum base. See Lambert et al. 2014.
6
7
8 Noted, and added to the text.
9
10 - l.502: You mention that you compare density of the facial crest to density of the rostrum. It should be noted that
11 different bones of the rostrum (or parts of them) often display significant differences in compactness. For example,
12 the porcelanous part of the premaxilla is often much more compact (see Mead & Fordyce, 2009; Lambert et al. 2011).
13 So taking the rostrum as a whole may possibly not be the best choice (or some rephrasing could be useful). In figure
14 8a, it seems that the densest bone on the rostrum is indeed the premaxilla.
15 Lambert, O., Buffrénil, V., de, and Muizon, C., de. 2011. Rostral densification in beaked whales: diverse processes for
16 a similar pattern. Comptes Rendus Palevol 10: 453-468.
17
18 Here we sampled bone density in the lower (more ventral) sections of the rostrum to avoid the influence of the
19
denser premaxillae. We have modified the text of the manuscript to explain this, and figure 8 has been modified to
20
more specifically show the sections of the skull that were sampled.
21
22
23 - l.511: It would be useful to precise here and in the supplementary table how the maximum height of the crest is
24 measured (from the orbit roof? from the approximate dorsal surface of the non-thickened part of the maxilla +
25 frontal?). If you measure the height of the crest from the ventral surface of the orbit roof, it implies that the fossa for
26 the frontal lobe of the pterygoid sinus of squalodelphinids invades the crest.
27
28 We have added this text to the revisions (see Results 3.5.e. “Relative size”).
29
30 - l.532: 'invaded by air spaces of the pterygoid air sac system': It would be great to highlight the connection between
31 the pterygoid sinus system and the air spaces on the ventromedial surface of the crest of Platanista. Maybe with
32 arrows and possibly a cross section at a different level.
33
34
Done. This has been added to figure 7, where the connection is now circled.
35
36
37 - l.533: 'air pocket in-tucking from the ventral side': I guess that this corresponds to a deeper fossa for the orbital lobe
38 of the pterygoid sinus as compared to squalodelphinids and Araeodelphis. It would be helpful reminding this here.
39 The homology of the fossa in the orbit of squalodelphinids with the deeper fossa in Pomatodelphis has bee proposed
40 by Lambert et al. (2014, p. 995) and Bianucci et al. (2015, p. 7).

42 Odontoceti, Cetacea) from the early Miocene of Peru. Comptes Rendus Palevol 14: 5-13.
43
44 Noted. This clarification has been added to the text, and the references have also been added.
45
46 - l.538: 'in a novel way (among odontocetes)': How does such a potential communication differ from the connection
47 in Platanista? Would'nt it be homologous?
48
49
We appreciate the suggestion and we have modified the revised text. See Results 3.5.f. “Pneumatization.”
50
51
52 - l.538-541: 'less obvious pneumatization': see comment above about the possible absence of pneumatization in
53 Dilophodelphis. I do not think that areas of lower density could be seen as an intermediary stage between no
54 pneumatization and pneumatization, and I would suggest modifying figure 6 for the status of Dilophodelphis.

2
3 OK, we have modified our discussion about pneumatization, including a new character state to accommodate the
4
observations of Dilophodelphis. We agree with the reviewer, and have modified the text here to agree with this
5
stance. Figure 6 (now figure 8) has been modified.
6
7
8 - l.554-563: This part mostly includes observations and partly repeats elements of part 3.5.a (cranial elements). I
9 would move all these elements in the paragraph 3.5.a, where they could be merged with existing parts.
10
11 While we appreciate the reviewer’s opinion, we think it is important at this point in the paper to briefly synthesize
12 the results discussed in part 3.5.a (and the following sections). We elect to keep this text here.
13
14 - l.587-590: 'Our analysis supports the concept of a monoplyletic Platanistoidea...': On which argument did you base
15 your decision to exclude Squalodon from Platanistoidea? I am afraid that the sample of taxa included here is too
16 narrow to allow testing the content of the superfamily, considering that no delphinidan, ziphiid or physeteroid is
17 included. I would suggest to only focus on homodont platanistoid subclades.
18
19
We have modified our phylogenetics discussion to include mention of both options for a monophyletic
20
Platanistoidea: both with and without Squalodon, though the version without Squalodon has slightly higher support
21
22 in our analysis.
23
24 - Functional morphology: There is only one specimen of Dilophodelphis described, so we cannot have an idea about
25 intraspecific variation at the level of the development of crests. But because crests have been demonstrated (1) to
26 grow during ontogeny and (2) to be highly sexually dimorphic in several ziphiids (see Hyperoodon), it may be worth
27 commenting on intraspecific variation at this level in Platanista (based on literature). Based on the results of such a
28 research, it may be worth commenting on the possibility for the crests of Dilophodelphis to have been sexually
29 dimorphic. Also, if the holotype is an immature individual (as proposed by the authors), even larger crests could be
30 expected in older specimens. This is only a suggestion.
31
32 We have added a short paragraph in the discussion on the possibility of intraspecific variation inferred from living
33 species.
34
35
- Figures: In general the illustrations of the skull are of good quality, and the combination of a photo with a second
36
37 photo with an opacity mask is fine. However, I would have expected many more labels, at least for elements
38 described in the diagnosis and text. See comments on the annotated pdf.
39
40 More labels have been added to the figures, including all diagnostic features.
41
42 - Figure 5: Enlarged views of the periotic would be useful, especially one in the conventional ventral view of the
43 bone.
44
45 An additional figure has been added with an enlarged view of the periotic in ventral view, the only view available
46 given its position in the skull. We think these illustrations address this issue.
47
48 - Suplemental figure 1: Parts d and e are slightly misleading. This looks like sounds come from one direction and are
49
reflected in that same direction. In Platanista, the phonic lips are posterodorsal and the sounds are transmitted
50
anteroventrally. It may be needed to illustrate this with a more tangential reflextion of sound. Otherwise, some more
51
52 words of explanation would be useful.
53
54 We thank the reviewer for this observation, and have modified the caption of the figure to clarify that parts d and e
55 are simple representations of the reflective properties of concave vs. convex surfaces, and are not representative of the
56 specific directional reflective properties of the supraorbital crests. The directional reflection of the crests in

9 23 Abstract
10 24
11 25 Many odontocete groups have developed enlarged facial crests, although these crestsy differ
12
13 26 in topography, composition, and function. The most elaborate crests occur in the South
14 27 Asian river dolphin (Platanista gangetica), in which they rise dorsally as delicate,
15 28 pneumatized wings anterior of the facial bones. Their position wrapping around the melon
16 29 suggests their involvement in sound propagation for echolocation. To better understand the
17
18 30 origin of crests in this lineage, we examined facial crests among fossil and living
19 31 Platanistoidea, including a new taxon, Dilophodelphis fordycei, nov. gen. and sp., described
20 32 herein, from the early Miocene Astoria Formation of Oregon, U.S.A. We measured the
21 33 physical extent and thickness of platanistoid crests, categorized their relative position, and
22
23 34 used computed tomography scans to examine their internal morphology and relative bone
24 35 density. Integrating these traits in a phylogenetic context, we determined that the onset of
25 36 crest elaboration or enlargement and the evolution of crest pneumatization among the
26 37 platanistoids were separate events, with crest enlargement beginning in the Oligocene.
27
28 38 However, we find, but no evidence for pneumatization occurred until possibly the early
29 39 Miocene, although certainly by the middle Miocene. Such an evolutionary context, including
30 40 data from the fossil record, should inform modeling efforts that seek to understand the
31 41 diversity of sound generation morphology in Odontoceti.
32
42
33
34 43 1. Introduction
35 44
36 45 Cetacean skulls are dramatically different in construction from their closest mammalian
37 46 relatives, largely reflecting adaptation to demands imposed by life in water versus ancestry
38
47 on land. Many cetacean skull elements are posteriorly ‘telescoped,’ a term referring to the
39
40 48 elongation of rostral elements and posterior movement of caudal elements, resulting in the
41 49 overlap of facial bones that were once adjacent in ancestral configurations more typical of
42 50 land mammals [1]. In odontocetes, telescoping has layered the maxillae over the frontals in
43
51 the antorbital/supraorbital region of the face. Many odontocete taxa (including Physeter
44
45 52 macrocephalus Linnaeus, 1758 [2], Hyperoodon ampulltatllus Forster, 1770 [3], and Inia Formatted: Font: Helvetica Neue
46 53 geoffrensis (Blainville, 1817 [4])) also have elevated facial crests of varying degrees in the
47 54 antorbital/supraorbital region, composed of the frontals and maxillae. Hypotheses on the
48
55 function of these crests vary from taxon to taxon, including a range from structural support
49
50 56 (e.g., Physeter) to a head-butting apparatus (e.g., Hyperoodon) [5]. Equally, ffacial crests may
51 57 also serve as attachment surfaces for the origin of facial and rostral muscles [6,7].

9 59 The most elaborate facial crests occur in the South Asian river dolphin (Platanista gangetica
10 60 spp.) (Lebeck, 1801 [86]), where they rise dorsally above the level of the nuchal crest in the
11
61 supraorbital region as extremely thin wings, and extend anteriorly to the level of the
12
13 62 antorbital notches. In Platanista, these crests are unique among cetaceans both because of
14 63 their relative size and because they are completely pneumatized. The pterygoid air sac
15 64 system, which is usually limited to the ventral side of the skull, invades dorsally and lines the
16
65 entire medial surface of the supraorbital crests [97,108]. The crests also wrap around the
17
18 66 melon, a fatty organ involved in sound generation. Both the position and pneumatization of
19 67 the crests suggest their involvement in the generation or propagation of sound in the head,
20 68 though this hypothesis is difficult to test both experimentally, and even more so logistically
21 69 considering the endangered status of this species [119,120]
22
23 70
24 71 To better understand the evolutionary origin of the crests and pneumatization in this lineage,
25 72 we examined the supraorbital crests in a group phylogenetically allied with Platanista.
26 73 Termed Platanistoidea, this group of cetaceans consists of taxa whose stratigraphic range
27
28 74 spans from the mid-Oligocene to the present, including almost exclusively marine forms
29 75 except for Platanista [131]. We measured the relative size of the crests, analyzed their cranial
30 76 element composition, and characterized their shape. In addition, we used computed
31 77 tomography (CT) scanning to examine the internal morphology and relative bone density of
32
33 78 the crests.
34 79
35 80 Results show that almost all members of the group Platanistidae (sensu Boersma and Pyenson
36 81 2016 [131]), including a new taxon Dilophodelphis Boersma, McCurry & Pyenson, 2017,
37
82 have elevated crests that show varying amount of pneumatization, though the
38
39 83 pneumatization differs in different taxa. More basal branching platanistoids, and the basal-
40 84 most platanistid Araeodelphis Kellogg, 1957 [142], show small supraorbital crests, and with
41 85 no patent pneumatization. Dilophodelphis has crests that are highly elevated, but also show
42
86 no clear signs of pneumatization. The remaining platanistid species, i.e. Pomatodelphis
43
44 87 inaequalis Allen, 1921 [15], Zarhachis flagellator Cope, 1868 [16], and Platanista gangetica,
45 88 all show elevated supraorbital crests with varying amounts of pneumatization. Both crest Formatted: Font: Italic

13 97 2.1. Data collection
14 98
15 99 To examine and compare internal supraorbital crest morphology, we selected candidate
16 100 specimens from putative platanistoid groups (see Boersma and Pyenson [131] for a
17 101 discussion), which were then CT scanned using Nikon Metrology’s combined 225/450kV
18
19 102 microfocus X-ray and computed tomography (CT) walk-in vault system at Chesapeake
20 103 Testing in Belcamp, Maryland, U.S.A. Using the vault CT scanner system, we collected CT
21 104 slices at 0.63 mm, resulting in three-dimensional reconstruction increments of 0.30 mm. We
22 105 used this instrumentation to CT scan the holotype of Dilophodelphis fordycei (USNM
23
106 214911), as well as specimens of Squalodon calvertensis Kellogg, 1923 [173] (Squalodontidae,
24

Formatted: Font: Not Italic
28 Formatted: Font: Not Italic
110 crests were also scanned for finer scale comparisons, including Platanista gangetica,
29 Formatted: Font: Not Italic
30 111 Pomatodelphis inaequalis Allen, 1921 [15] and Zarhachis flagellator. Cope, 1868 [16]. The
31 112 latter two taxa were scanned using a Siemens SOMATOM Emotion 6 CT scanner located at
32 113 the National Museum of Natural History. OneA Platanista specimen (USNM 23456) that we
33
114 examined had the left supraorbital crest separated from the skull at a clean break, which was
34
35 115 carefully fitted to the skull for scanning. The DICOM files produced from all the scans were
36 116 examined in ImageJ [187] and processed in Mimics (Materialise NV, Leuven, Belgium) to
37 117 create 3D surface models. The model of Dilophodelphis will be available for viewing and

45 123
46 124 We tested the phylogenetic placement of Dilophodelphis using a modified version of a
47 125 platanistoid matrix published by Godfrey et al. [198], which was modified from Lambert et
48 126 al.’s [2019] original matrix as a base. Godfrey et al. [19]’s version consisted of 41

127 morphological characters and 21 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) including the fossil

132 Araeodelphis and the extant Platanista. Also included were the contested platanistoids,
12
13 133 Waipatia Fordyce, 1994 [276], and Squalodon. We added three genera: Goedertius Kimura
14 134 and Barnes, 2016 [254], Arktocara, and Otekaikea Tanaka and Fordyce, 2014 [287], and
15 135 removed four taxa that were not relevant for our analysis, resulting in 20 OTUs. We altered
16
136 character 48 (pneumatic maxillary crest overhanging medially), making it a multi-state
17
18 137 character to account for the varying degrees of pneumatization as seen in Zarhachis and
19 138 Pomatodelphis vs. Platanista (see discussion for further comment on differing
20 139 pneumatization). We also removed one character (character 4 in Godfrey et al. [198]) that we
21 140 found subjective and problematic, and added 27 morphological characters, resulting in a total
22
23 141 of 67 characters used in the analysis.
24 142
25 143 2.3. Functional Analysis
26 144 We used CT scans of extant and fossil platanistids to examine the relative boney density of
27
28 145 three regions of the skull: the ventral section of the rostrum which is composed of maxillaery
29 146 bonethe rostrum, the supraorbital crests and the zygomatic processes of the squamosal. We
30 147 avoided collecting data on bone density from the dorsal portion of the premaxillae, which
31 148 can be hyper-ossified [29, 30].,; We used the “Draw profile line” function in Mimics (version Formatted: Not Highlight
32
149 18, Materialise) to collect lateral profiles in Hounsfield Units (a scale of radiodensity). This
33
34 150 method provided a way to estimate relative density within each CT scan but it didoes not
35 151 allow for density measures to be directly compared between specimens. This limitation is
36 152 acceptable because since theour goal was to evaluate the difference in bone density between
37
153 the supraorbital crests and the rest of the skull in each individual specimen.

15 208 Holotype: USNM 214911 consists of an almost complete skull retaining both periotics, but
16 209 missing theboth the tympanic bullae, the very distal tip of the rostrum (not more than ~1
17 210 cm), both mandibles, fragments of the basicranium, and all dentition except for a fewseveral
18 211 isolatedfew separate teeth that were originally prepared out of the matrix by Douglas. R.
19
20 212 Emlong.R. Emlong. While none of the teeth remain in the rostrum, based on archival notes
21 213 on the preparation and condition of this specimen at USNM, we are confident that these
22 214 isolated teeth are indeed associated with this taxon because of their matching alveolar size
23 215 and placement close to the skull, including the size and morphological correspondence of
24
25 216 three isolated teeth that still are in contact with zygomatic process of the squamosalallow us
26 217 to say with confidence that they are almost certainly associated with this taxon. In
27 218 November, 1970, Emlong collected a second specimen,: both mandibles of an unknown
28 219 cetacean, found in a drift concretion directly in front of the spot in the cliff where USNM
29
30 220 214911 was found. However, based on the mismatched size of the mandibles relative to
31 221 USNM 214911, we can definitively exclude them from belonging to the holotype of
32 222 Dilophodelphis.
33 223
34 224 Type Locality, Formation and Age: The holotype was recovered by Emlong in December
35
225 1967. Emlong’s notes indicate the locality of Nye Beach, Oregon, USA, about 0.4 km south of
36
37 226 the Jump-Off Joe site and 0.4 km north of what was then the Hotel Gilmore. Jump-Off Joe
38 227 was a sea stack formation of middle Miocene concretionary sandstone, located at about
39 228 44.6454° N, 124.0626° W. Hotel Gilmore, originally the New Cliff House and now the Sylvia
40
229 Beach Hotel, is a U.S. National Register Historic Place sitting on a bluff above Nye Beach, at
41
42 230 44.6383° N, 124.0621° W [33]. Based on Emlong’s notes, the type locality of USNM 214911
43 231 should be halfway between these two locations, at approximately 44.6417° N, 124.0626° W.
44 232 Emlong reported that the skull was found in the Astoria Formation, a Miocene marine
45
233 sequence exposed along the seacliffs north and south of Yaquina Head in Newport, Oregon,
46
47 234 though Emlong did not document more specific information about the stratigraphic position
48 235 of the holotype. South of Yaquina Head, the lower part of the formation is exposed, and is
49 236 approximately 130 m thick [374]. Benthic foraminifera sampled from the Astoria Formation
50
237 in the Newport area were mostly Saucesian in age [384] and molluscs sampled from the
51
52 238 formation further constrain it to 20.7-15.1 Ma. Molluscs specifically from the Jump-Off Joe

242 Differential Diagnosis:
13
14 243 Dilophodelphis is a small to medium-sized platanistoid odontocete (approximately 2.27 m in
15 244 total length), which belongs to Platanistoidea (sensu Boersma and Pyenson [131]) based on
16 245 two2 synapomorphies: emargination of the posterior edge of the zygomatic process by the
17
246 sternomastoid muscle fossa with the skull in lateral view (character 52[2]); and ventral
18
19 247 surface of the posterior process of the periotic, concave along a straight path perpendicular to
20 248 its long axis (character 66[1]). Character 52 shows state reversals among the platanistoids.
21 249 The remaining 4 platanistoid synapomorphies recovered in our phylogenetic analysis are
22 250 either not preserved or obscured by matrix in the holotype of Dilophodelphis.
23
251
24
25 252 Dilophodelphis differs from all known Waipatiidae, Squalodelphinidae and Allodelphinidae
26 253 in having a distinct dorsal crest in the antorbital-supraorbital region (character 8[1]);]). ; and
27 254 in having a pneumatic maxillary crest overhanging medially (character 48[1]).
28 255 Dilophodelphis differs from waipatiids and squalodelphinids in having a deeply grooved
29
30 256 lateral rostral suture between the premaxilla and the maxilla (character 3[1]); in lacking
31 257 accessory denticles on posterior teeth (character 32[1]); in lacking cheek teeth entocingulum
32 258 (character 44[1]); in having a small tooth diameter as a percent of postorbital skull width
33 259 (character 45[2]); in having the robust and globose/rectilinear antorbital processes of the
34
35 260 maxilla in dorsal view (character 46[1]); and in having the ventral edge of the zygomatic
36 261 process almost straight in lateral view (character 53[1]). Dilophodelphis further differs from
37 262 waipatiids and allodelphinids by having an elevated antorbital region distinctly higher than
38 263 the dorsal margin of the rostrum base in lateral view (character 7[1]); having a deep fossa in
39
264 the frontal on the orbit roof at the level of the frontal groove (character 12[1]); and having a
40
41 265 circle-shaped dorsal outline of the zygomatic process of the squamosal in lateral view
42 266 (character 18[1]). Dilophodelphis differs from waipatiids and other platanistids in having a
43 267 square-shaped pars cochlearis of the periotic (character 20[1]).
44 268
45
269 Dilophodelphis also differs from the Waipatiidae in having a deep, ‘V’-shaped antorbital
46
47 270 notch in relation to an anteriorly pointed antorbital process (character 6[1]); having a
48 271 cranium distinctly shorter than wide with a ratio <0.90 (character 10[1]); wide hamular fossa
49 272 of the pterygoid sinus, extending anteriorly onto the palatal surface of the rostrum (character
50
273 16[1]); transverse thickening of the anterior process of the periotic (character 23[1]); and in
51
52 274 having a lateral lamina of the palatine (character 54[1]).

10 276 Dilophodelphis differs from the Allodelphinidae in lacking an elongated rostrum (character
11 277 1[0]), having wide premaxillae at the rostrum base (character 4[1]), having the dorsal
12
278 opening of the mesorostral groove anterior to the rostrum base narrower than the premaxilla
13
14 279 (character 5[0]), having a concave lateral margin of the rostrum anterior to the maxillary
15 280 flange (character 41[0]), having a deep posterolateral sulcus (character 47[0]), having a
16 281 shallow premaxillary cleft (character 50[2]); and having the ventral surface of the posterior
17
282 process of the periotic concave along a straight path perpendicular to its long axis (character
18
19 283 66[1]).
20 284
21 285 Dilophodelphis belongs to the family Platanistidae based on the following: medial margin of Formatted: Font: Italic
22 286 the antorbital notch made of a thin plate (character 38[1]); and dorsal surface of the vertex Formatted: Font: Not Italic
23 287 markedly transversely and longitudinally convex (character 39[1]). Dilophodelphis also
24
25 288 shares the following characteristics with all the platanistids, excluding Araeodelphis: lateral
26 289 rostral suture between premaxilla and maxilla deeply grooved (character 3[1]), distinct dorsal
27 290 crest in the antorbital-supraorbital region (character 8[1]), antorbital process of maxilla
28 291 robust and globose or rectilinear in dorsal view (character 46[1]), and presence of a shallow
29
30 292 premaxillary cleft (character 50[2]).
31 293
32 294 Dilophodelphis differs from all other known platanistids in having an enlarged
33 295 tympanosquamosal recess forming a large triangular fossa medial and anteromedial to the
34 296 postglenoid process (character 55[2]). Dilophodelphis demonstrates one clear apomorphy: a
35
297 deep emargination of the posterior edge of the zygomatic process by the sternomastoid fossa,
36
37 298 in lateral view (character 52[2]). Further features that distinguish Dilophodelphis from other
38 299 platanistids are discussed in the “Morphological comparisons” section of the discussion.
39 300 Finally, Dilophodelphis demonstrates the following possibly plesiomorphic character statess
40
301 (shared with at least some of the squalodelphinids)apomorphies: deep, ‘V’-shaped antorbital
41
42 302 notch in relation to an anteriorly pointed antorbital process (character 6[1]); semi-circular
43 303 dorsal outline of the zygomatic process of the squamosal in lateral view (character 18[1]);
44 304 pars cochlearis of the periotic square-shaped in ventral view (character 20[1]);]). ; and deep
45
305 emargination of the posterior edge of the zygomatic process by the sternomastoid fossa, in
46
47 306 lateral view (character 52[2]).

16 317 3.2. Abbreviated Description
17
318
18
19 319 The following outlines the key features of the holotype, with terminology following Mead
20 320 and Fordyce [2936]; for all measurements of the skull, see Table 1. The skull is nearly
21 321 complete, measuring 44 cm in maximum sagittal length, and missing only the very distal tip
22 322 of the rostrum (likely no more than a couple centimetersnot more than ~1 cm), the lower
23
24 323 jaws, the tympanic bullae, and fragments of the basicranium (Figures 1-65). Several teeth
25 324 were found in the surrounding matrix adjacent to the skull, but none were retained in the
26 325 rostrum itself (Figure 5). Also found separated from the skull were the left nasal and an
27 326 isolated fragment of the left paroccipital process. The entire skull is asymmetrically skewed
28
327 in a variety of different ways. While the asymmetry in the facial region is likely originalreal,
29
30 328 based on comparison with other plantanistoids, the asymmetrical skew of the rostrum from
31 329 the sagittal plane is likely attributable to diagenesis.
32 330
33 331 Dorsal view
34
332 The rostrum is practically complete, missing 1 cm from the distal end at most, and moderate
35
36 333 in length, measuring approximately 28.3 cm from the anterior tip to the right antorbital
37 334 notch (Figures 1-3). Both rostral premaxillae bear a small foramen, approximately 5 cm from
38 335 the preserved rostral tip, with the foramina on the right premaxilla slightly further anterior
39
336 than the left. The left premaxilla may possibly exhibithave a second, small foramenina, less
40
41 337 than 2 cm from the anterior tip of the rostrum, but it is less distinct than the other two.
42 338 Anteriorly, the left and right premaxillae remain in contact along the midline and roof over

20 356 supraorbital crests extend anteroposteriorly from the antorbital process to a level between
21 357 the postorbital process and the nuchal crest (Figure 3). They are robust and rounded dorsally,
22
23 358 with the maxillae forming the medial face and the frontal forming the lateral face. The
24 359 premaxillae continue to widen transversely from the rostral base to approximately the level
25 360 of the postorbital processes, at which point they maintain a regular width until the level of
26 361 the external nares (Figure 1). Heading posteriorly from the external nares towards the vertex,
27
28 362 the premaxillae contract transversely and rise dorsally above the maxillae once again. Both
29 363 premaxillae are asymmetrically skewed to the left, with the right one possessing a distinct

34 367 The left nasal is disassociated from the skull, but it likely was in contact medially with the
35 368 right nasal, which is roughly square in dorsal view, and rests on the vertex in a fossa of the
36 369 frontal. The left, disassociated nasal is thicker medially, narrowing in dorsoventral depth
37
370 laterally. The right nasal is separated from the premaxilla by a small exposure of frontal,
38
39 371 possibly due to breakage of the lateral edge of the nasal. The frontals are barely exposed on
40 372 the vertex, as an anteroposteriorly narrow rectangle between the nasals and the nuchal crest.
41 373 The vertex is dorsally elevated to the level of the nuchal crest, and the temporal fossae are

14 386 anterodorsal edge of the zygomatic process of the squamosal, separated only by a thin layer

19 390 is laterally convex, and its circumference is roughly shaped like a spear tip, with a narrowly
20 391 pointed anterior margin and a shallowly pointed posterior margin, in lateral view. Both
21 392 lacrimals are present, and appear to compose the ventral edge of the antorbital process and

26 396 the squamosal (though this positioning is likely due to diagenetic displacedment, as the jugal

32 401 transverse constriction dorsal to the level of the occipital condyles exposing the temporal
33
34 402 fossa (Figure 4c). Though the shield is generally posteriorly convex, there are deep fossae
35 403 immediately posterior to the nuchal crest, as well as shallower fossae medial to the transverse
36 404 constriction. The exoccipitals also bear deep dorsal condyloid fossae., Twith the squamosal is

411 In ventral view, the rostral maxilla bears two deep grooves medial to the alveolar groove on

47 413 third groove extendsruns down the midline of the rostrum where the maxillae come into
48 414 contact, widening approximately at the same level 17.5 cm posterior of the rostral tip to
49

30 435 likely approximately 35 teeth per tooth row in the rostrum. No teeth remain in the alveoli,
31 436 though a number were found in the surrounding matrix and two teeth are still stuck to the
32 437 left glenoid fossa by matrix. These teeth are homodont, with the longest 2.1 cm in length,

15 495 3.5. Crest comparison
16 496
17 497 a. Cranial elements
18
19 498 Our first step to characterizing platanistoid facial crests involved determining what cranial
20 499 elements contributed to the overall composition of the crests in different taxa (Figure 86). In
21 500 our survey, we determined that tTIn all cases, the crests are composed of either maxillae,
22 501 frontals, or both. In basal branching platanistoids (i.e., waipatiids, squalodontids and
23
24 502 allodelphinids), which exhibited little to no enlargement of the supraorbital crests, the
25 503 supraorbital region is composed of relatively equal parts of the frontals and overlying
26 504 maxillae. This ratio also holds true for squalodelphinids, which show some enlargement of
27 505 the crests, but with the maxillae still completely overlying the frontals. The platanistid
28
29 506 Araeodelphis shows a crest condition more similar to the squalodelphinids, with modest crest
30 507 enlargement and maxillae overlying the frontals. However, in platanistid taxa such as
31 508 Pomatodelphis, Zarhachis, and Dilophodelphis, with enlarged crests, they are composed of
32 509 frontals on the lateral faces and maxillae on the medial faces. These two cranial elements
33
510 meet along the dorsal ridge of each crest, at an indistinct suture. Platanista is the only
34
35 511 platanistoid where the crests are composed exclusively of maxillae. In the case of Platanista,
36 512 the maxillae haves extended dorsally and separated into two thin laminae, separated by
37 513 trabeculae and curving medially to wrap around the melon [97].
38 514
39
515 b. Asymmetry
40
41 516 Another changing morphological characteristic to note among platanistoids is the varying
42 517 asymmetry in the skull (Figure 86). Facial asymmetry, focused around the narial passages, is
43 518 typical in odontocete skulls, with multiple proposed functions including a rolel in sound
44
519 production, and an adaptation to protect the respiratory tract while swallowing large prey
45
46 520 items whole [4338,4439,4540]. In platanistoids, this skull asymmetry extends to the facial
47 521 crests, and in varying degrees among different putative subclades. In squalodontids and
48 522 allodelphinids, the skulls and supraorbital area are only slightly asymmetrical, but in
49
523 squalodelphinids and Araeodelphis both the relative size and position of the bilateral skull
50
51 524 elements are strongly skewed sinistrally. Cranial, extending to the antorbital notches and the
52 525 premaxillae at the rostrum base. This. cCranial asymmetry is even more extreme among the

14 530 hemispheres of the neurocranium.
15 531
16 532 c. Crest internal surface shape
17
533 We examined the shape of the supraorbital crests of Dilophodelphis relative to other
18
19 534 platanistids (with elevated crests (i.e. excluding Araeodelphis, whose crest condition is more
20 535 similar to that of squalodelphinids). Assuming that elaborate crests are involved in sound
21 536 production and propagation during echolocationsound generation, we proposed that the
22 537 internal surface would contribute to reflecting sound waves generated by the phonic lips,
23
24 538 which are located dorsomedial of the crests in the extant Platanista. We observed that the
25 539 crests and the corresponding air sacs of Platanista are unique among platanistoids (and all
26 540 fossil and living odontocetes) in having inward crest surfaces that are parabolic, opening
27 541 anteroventrally (Supplementary Figure 1). In contrast, the medial surfaces of the crests in
28
29 542 Pomatodelphis and Zarhachis are almost vertical, and in Dilophodelphis they are parabolic
30 543 again, but opening dorsally. Basic acoustic principles suggest a differential function to the
31 544 reflective properties of concave versus convex surfaces [461]. Convex surfaces (e.g., the
32 545 medial crest surface in Dilophodelphis) distribute reflected sound much more widely than
33
34 546 concave surfaces (e.g., Platanista’s crest surface), especially at high -frequencies. Concave
35 547 surfaces tend to concentrate reflected sound. As a result, if both supraorbital crests
36 548 participate in sound production/propagation for platanistoids, the range of surface
37 549 concavity/convexity and orientation would produce very different results for sound
38
550 propagation in the headin the soft tissues of the forehead. Lastly, we note that the
39
40 551 ventromedial surface of the crests of Platanista is highly rugose, a characteristic that would
41 552 also influence the reflective properties of the crests. More complex surfaces provide a
42 553 relatively larger surface for sound to interact with, and thus function better as sound
43
554 absorbers and sound diffusers than as sound reflectors [472]. However, if the interface
44
45 555 between the air sac system and the soft tissue acts to reflect sound, then the surface of this
46 556 bone may not be important in determining the reflective properties of this system. Lastly, in
47 557 this regard, it is difficult to make definitive statements about the acoustic properties without
48
558 knowing the point source of sound, which differs in different lineages of odontocetes and is
49
50 559 unknown for Platanista. Formatted: Font: Italic

11
564 which we used as a consistent comparative baseline. In all three platanistoids for which this
12
13 565 comparison could be made (Dilophodelphis fordycei, Platanista gangetica and Pomatodelphis
14 566 inaequalis), we determined that the crests and the maxillary section of the rostrum shared
15 567 similar high densities, while the zygomatic process was considerably less dense. The crests of
16
568 Dilophodelphis are slightly more relatively dense compared to the other two species (Figure
17
18 569 108).
19 570
20 571 e. Relative size
21 572 We determined the relative supraorbital crest size by measuring the greatest height of the
22 573 crest, and calculated it as a percentage of bizygomatic width (see supplementary table 1 for
23
24 574 supraorbital crest measurements).. Height was measured from the dorsal-most point on the
25 575 supraorbital crest to the ventral-most point on the orbit roof. Bizygomatic width has been
26 576 upheld as the most reliable proxy for condylobasal length, and was used because many of the
27 577 fossil skulls used are fragmentary [4037]. Platanista has by far the largest supraorbital crests,
28
29 578 measuring 58% of bizygomatic width. Dilophodelphis has the next largest crests, at only 28%
30 579 of bizygomatic width. Pillieri and Gihr [48][] provided a similar quantification of crests, Formatted: Not Highlight
31 580 though without providing nearly as specific details delimiting landmarks for the
32 581 morphometric measurements of the crests. Also, withouth corresponding skull
33
34 582 measurements (indeed, some of their reported vouchers may be lost), their data cannot be
35 583 directly compared to ours.See supplementary table 1 for supraorbital crest measurements.
36 584
37 585 f. Pneumatization
38 586 We used CT data to determine whether there was any evidence of pneumatization in the
39
587 supraorbital crests of platanistoids other than Platanista. The three basal-most platanistoids
40
41 588 scanned (Squalodon, Arktocara, and a squalodelphinid )Phocageneus) showed no
42 589 pneumatization of the crests (Figure 79). Cross-sectional CT scans at the level just anterior to
43 590 the antorbital notch in these taxa showed that the supraorbital area is composed of solid bone
44
591 (Figure 97). ). The modest supraorbital eminences in Araeodelphis appear to be devoid of
45
46 592 pneumatization, based on the observations made by Godfrey et al. [198]. In the referred
47 593 specimen of Araeodelphis (USNM 10478), as in squalodelphinids, the pterygoid sinus
48 594 excavates a deep fossa on the ventral surface of the frontal reaching to the outer margin of
49
595 the orbit roof, but it does not penetrate and open onto the dorsal side of the skull. However,
50
51 596 allDilophodelphis also has a deep fossa for the pterygoid sinus on the orbital roof of the
52 597 frontal. Cross-sectional scans of Dilophodelphis’ crests were patched with dark shadows,

15 603 demonstrate some evidence of pneumatization, though in different ways. As previously
16
604 stated, the crests of Platanista are composed of two maxillary laminae, joined by trabeculae
17
18 605 and invaded by air spaces of the pterygoid air sac system [97]. The CT scans of Pomatodelphis
19 606 showed that the crest has an air pocket in-tucking from the ventral side., corresponding to a
20 607 much deeper fossa for the orbital lobe of the pterygoid sinus as compared to
21 608 squalodelphinids, Araeodelphis and Dilophodelphis (Lambert et al. 2014, Bianucci et al.
22
23 609 2015). The slightly crushed appearance of the medial surface of facial crests in nearly every
24 610 specimen of Pomatodelphis suggests that, in life, the medial crest surfaces were likely
25 611 fenestrated closed by a thin layermargin of bone. However, it is possible that these air
26 612 pockets communicated openly with soft anatomy of the facial region in a novel way (among
27
28 613 odontocetes)., in a manner perhaps homologous with the sinus connections of Platanista.
29 614 (Figure 9). Zarhachis shows the same crest condition as Pomatodelphis. Dilophodelphis
30 615 showed less obvious pneumatization, but cross-sectional scans of the crests were patched
31 616 with dark shadows, either representing pneumatic spaces filled with matrix, or areas of lower
32
33 617 density bone that could be precursors to pneumatic spaces.

38
622
39
40 623 Facial crests are common traits in the supraorbital region of odontocetes ([2936]: Ttable 1),
41 624 yet their disparate composition and placement challenges interpretations of their homology
42 625 and function. Among platanistoids, supraorbital crests are most evident among two nominal
43
626 groups: squalodelphinids and platanistids. Allodelphinids and waipatiids show supraorbital
44
45 627 crests generally on par with mostother delphinoids ([2936]: Figure fig 1), whereas the
46 628 thickness and topography of supraorbital crests in squalodelphinids and platanistids are
47 629 distinctive features of the facial region. Squalodelphinids show no evidence of
48
630 pneumatization of the supraorbital crests, and this also holds true for Araeodelphis. and
49
50 631 Dilophodelphis. Though a phylogenetically a platanistid, Araeodelphis has crests only
51 632 slightly more enlarged than squalodelphinids. It is also worth mentioning that that the

11
636 supraorbital region makes a clear determination of this impossible, and we did not have
12
13 637 access to the specimen for this study.. Platanista Platanista possesses the largest supraorbital
14 638 crests of any platanistoid, based on pure linear morphometrics, with those of Dilophodelphis
15 639 ranking second in size, and Zarhachis close behind. Compositionally, the crests ofin
16
640 Platanista are composed solely of the maxillae, which is ais unique condition among
17
18 641 platanistoids—all others have crests composed of both the maxillae and frontals. The
19 642 supraorbital crests of Dilophodelphis, Pomatodelphis and Zarhachis are composed of
20 643 relatively equal surfaces of the frontals and maxillae, with the maxillae forming the internal
21 644 surfaces and the frontals forming the exterior surfaces (Figure 86). Internally, there are clear
22
23 645 indications that all the platanistids, excluding Araeodelphis and Dilophodelphis, show some
24 646 degree of pneumatization in the supraorbital crests. Any future studies to test the role of
25 647 Platanista’s supraorbital crests in sound production should take into consideration all the
26 648 crest characteristics outlined above, and how they have changed phylogenetically and
27
28 649 through geologic time. Formatted: Font: Helvetica Neue, 12 pt
29 650
30 651 Considering how different the condition of the differences in putative pneumatization is
31 652 betweenamong Pomatodelphis,/ Zarhachis, and Platanista, the question arises of how to Formatted: Font: Not Italic
32
33 653 define pneumatization. In Pomatodelphis and Zarhachis, the fossa for the pterygoid sinus is
34 654 excavated so deeply, that there are three clearly defined bony walls of the cavity. In
35 655 Platanista, the pneumatic air spaces are contained between the two thin, bony lamina of the
36 656 maxilla. Therefore, we define pneumatic spaces in the supraorbital crests as air spaces
37
657 encompassed within the bony laminaee, differentiating them from the pterygoid sinus fossa
38
39 658 seen in the squalodelphinids, Araeodelphis and Dilophodelphis. The discovery of more
40 659 platanistids will surely help to clarify the transitional states between
41 660 Araeodelphis/Dilophodelphis, Pomatodelphis/Zarhachis, and Platanista. As these are
42
661 foundWith new data, more states will haveneed to be added to phylogenetic analyses to
43
44 662 account for the variation of pneumatized states among platanistids. For now, we have
45 663 defined three: lack of pneumatization in Araeodelphis and Dilophodelphis;, moderate
46 664 pneumatization in Pomatodelphis and Zarhachis;, and extensive pneumatization in
47
665 Platanista.

10 671 fossil ziphiids) [50,51]. Among these groups are the other so-called river dolphin genera
11
672 (Inia and Pontoporia), the physeteroids (Physeter and Kogia), delphinids (Tursiops) and
12
13 673 ziphiids (Mesoplodon and Hyperoodon). However, the nomenclature and homology of these
14 674 facial crests have been confused and debated for centuries. In their lexicon of odontocete
15 675 skull morphology, Mead and Fordyce [2936] discriminate and elucidate these, differentiating
16
676 the types of crests, ridges, tubercles in the antorbital and supraorbital region; their Table 1 is
17
18 677 an especially useful rubric for tracing the changing terminology used by previous authors for
19 678 these features. Our description of the variation in supraorbital crest morphology among the
20 679 platanistoids expands on these observations made by Mead and Fordyce [2936], and provides
21 680 the first quantitative data describing this variation in this group. Formatted: Font: Helvetica Neue, 12 pt

23 681
24 682 With only one known specimen of Dilophodelphis, described we cannot be certain of the
25 683 level of intraspecific variation in crest morphology but we can comment on the intraspecific
26 684 variation seen in the crests of other odontocetes. The crests Hyperoodon, which are used in
27
28 685 antagonistic “head-butting” behaviors, are larger in males [52] (Gowans and Rendell 1999)
29 686 and grow larger and flatter during ontogenontogeny [53]. y (Hardy 2005). Dissimilarly,
30 687 sexual dimorphism in the crest morphology of Platanista is minimal [48Pilleri and Gihr
31 688 1971]. Anderson [54] (1979) stateds that the crests of both adult and juvenile Platanista are Formatted: Font: Italic
32
33 689 “more or less quadrangular” but that small changes in shape occur over the life of the
34 690 organismontogeny including that that the crests become more constricts the creststed
35 691 posteriorly in adults. In an physically immature state, Dilophodelphis appears to have well
36 692 developed crests, but it is possible that these could even become larger in older individuals,
37
693 or that the morphology may differ between males and females of the species. With the
38
39 694 discovery of more fossils of this species, we may gain a better understanding of intraspecific
40 695 variation in crest morphology, which may in turn shed light on the function of these crests.

10 706 the rostrum of Dilophodelphis is at times equal in width and depth (i.e. at the midlength of
11
707 the rostrum). Araeodelphis also lacks the dorsoposterior sweeping of the alveolar groove as it
12
13 708 approaches the rostral base, as seen in Dilophodelphis. Dilophodelphis further differs from
14 709 Araeodelphis in the shape of its premaxillae posteriorly, which are transversely constricted

31 723 reduction of the bony orbit, no extreme enlargement/deepening of the posterolateral sulcus,
32
33 724 rostrum not transversely flattened, and less reduction of the nasal bones. Dilophodelphis also

731 Our analysis supports the concept of a monophyletic Platanistoidea, which includes the
42
43 732 living Platanista, and a cluster of allied, extinct sub-clades that consist of three nominal
44 733 families (Allodelphinidae, Squalodelphinidae, and Platanistidae), as well as Waipatia, and
45 734 Otekaikea, and possibly Squalodon. with Waipatia as the most basal lineage in the clade.
46
735 Platanistoidea (excluding Squalodon) is supported by 6 synapomorphies: emargination of the

48 736 posterior edge of zygomatic process by neck muscle fossae, skull in lateral view [character

12
743 By mapping both the presence or absence of crest pneumatization and the relative size of the
13
14 744 crests onto our strict consensus phylogenetic tree, we were able to visualize these traits in an
15 745 evolutionary context (Figure 79). Our analysis shows that both enlarged crest size and
16 746 pneumatization evolved only once, and in one clade (Squalodelphinidae+Platanistidae), but
17
747 at different times. The enlargement of the supraorbital crests began in the late Oligocene
18
19 748 [55], with the Squalodelphinidae evolving modest-sized crests. In the early Miocene,
20 749 supraorbital crests reached extreme sizes among with the appearance of the platanistids.
21 750 However, the Squalodelphinidae evolved enlarged crests without the invasion of air sacs. Not
22 751 until the early Miocene, with the appearance of the platanistids and the evolution of
23
24 752 extremely large crests, does pneumatization also appear. Therefore, the evolution of
25 753 pneumatization is de-coupled from the enlargement of the supraorbital crests among the
26 754 platanistoids.
27 755
28
29
756 4.3.4.4. Functional morphology
30 757
31 758 The morphology of Dilophodelphis raises several questions about the function of supraorbital
32 759 crests in platanistoids. Our only extant model for the function of supraorbital crests in
33 760 platanistoids is the South Asian river dolphin (Platanista gangetica), whose prominent,
34
761 concave crests are hypothesized to serve a role in echolocation because they support
35
36 762 maxillary sinuses that lie dorsal to the melon, though experimental determination remains
37 763 hard to achieve. In other odontocetes, sound produced by the phonic lips is reflected or
38 764 absorbed by either the sinus systemair sac system surrounding the nasal passages, or the
39
765 crests themselves, producing a more anteriorly projected acoustic signal [5643,5744]. For
40
41 766 Platanista, Pilleri [5845] referred to this system as a “sound screen” that prevents sound from
42 767 passing latvenertrdorsolaterallyventrally from the caudal half of the melon. A priori we
43 768 would expect that crests used to reflect sound anteriorly would have a highly concave medial
44
769 surface (allowing them to focus reflected sound rather than dissipating it) and that they
45
46 770 would be denser (which would allow for greater acoustic impedance mismatch between soft
47 771 tissue and bone). The density and morphology of the crests in Platanista certainly meet these
48 772 requirements. However, the internal surface of the crests of Platanista are highly convoluted,
49
773 which would prevent reflection of sound and instead may allow for sound to be better
50
51 774 absorbed by the bone. Because of this configuration, we infer that if Platanista is reflectsing
52 775 sound anteriorly using its crests, it is probably doing so using the sinuses lining the crests

9 776 rather than the bone itself. The acoustic mismatch between soft tissue and air is much lower
10 777 than that between air and compact bone though, which logically would be a less effective
11
778 method of sound reflection. More basic anatomical work on this highly endangeredhighly- Formatted: Highlight
12
13 779 endangered taxon is necessary to refine and ground truthground truth these hypotheses.
14 780
15 781 The morphology of Dilophodelphis’ crests differ substantially from those of Platanista. They
16 782 are robust and both laterally and dorsally expanded. Their medial surface is convex, a
17
783 characteristic that would make it difficult for these structures to focus sound in any certain
18
19 784 direction. The density of the crests of Dilophodelphis are is similar to that in density to other
20 785 platanistoids. In all species included in our analysis, the crests were denser than the
21 786 zygomatic process but of similar density to the maxillary bone e within the rostrum. The
22 787 crests of Dilophodelphis are slightly denser than those of Platanista and Pomatodelphis
23
24 788 compared to the other regions of the skull. Unfortunately, this finding may not tell us much
25 789 about possible variation in crest function in these taxa (Figure 108). Diagenetic processes may
26 790 also influence these results and so care must be taken when drawing conclusions from small
27 791 differences in density. Also, it may be that most of the acoustic impedance is undertaken by
28
29 792 the maxillary sinuses rather than the bone itself, and hence bone density may not be an
30 793 important factor in determining the performance of the system.
31 794
32 795 There are multiple possible functions for the large crests of Dilophodelphis. First, these crests
33 796 could support soft tissue structures or sinus systems in a similar way to Platanista, but the
34
35 797 relative size of the crests seems overdesigned for this purpose. Without a sinus system to
36 798 absorb or reflect sound, it is possible that bone needed to be thicker to adequately perform
37 799 the same function as a sound screen. Second, crests of this size could act as protection,
38 800 providing structural reinforcement for loads that occur during feeding, evading predators or
39
801 interspecific fighting (i.e., competition). However, it is hard to imagine a scenario where
40
41 802 loads are applied to this region of the cranium. The long slender rostrum would be more
42 803 likely to engage with an object rather than the dorsal surface of the head. Third, the crests
43 804 may act as display structures. Many species of odontocetes such as male beaked whales
44
805 possess elaborate display structures that allow for intraspecific or interspecific signaling. It
45
46 806 has even been hypothesized that odontocete species may be able to sense differences in
47 807 internal morphology using echolocation [5946]. However, this has primarily been
48 808 hypothesized in the case of beaked whalesthis hypothesis has mainly been applied to
49
809 ziphiids, where the facial and rostral bones are significantly more compact than in
50
51 810 Dilophodelphis. TheThe greatly enlarged surface area of the maxilla in the supraorbital

33 831 With only one specimen of Dilophodelphis described we cannot be certain of the level of
34 832 intraspecific variation in crest morphology but we can comment on the intraspecific
35 833 variation seen in the crests of other odontocetes. The crests Hyperoodon, which are used in
36 834 antagonistic “head-butting” behaviors, are larger in males (Gowans and Rendell 1999) and
37
835 grow larger and flatter during ontogeny (Hardy 2005). Dissimilarly, sexual dimorphism in
38
39 836 the crest morphology of Platanista is minimal. Anderson (1979) states that the crests of both
40 837 adult and juvenile Platanista are “more or less quadrangular” but that small changes in shape
41 838 occur over the life of the organism including that that the crests become more constricted
42
839 posteriorly in adults. In an immature state Dilophodelphis appears to have well developed
43
44 840 crests, but it is possible that these could even become larger in older individuals, or that the
45 841 morphology may differ between males and females of the species. With the discovery of
46 842 more fossils of this species we may gain a better understanding of intraspecific variation in
47
843 crest morphology, which may in turn shed light on the function of these crests.

33 Calibrated and supraorbital crest size phylogenetic trees
34 On the left is a time calibrated phylogenetic tree of the Platanistoidea, showing the node-based clade of
Platanistoidea and the node-based families Allodelphinidae, Squalodelphinidae, and Platanistidae, along with
35
their support values (bremer decay index/bootstrap value). Colored bars correspond to the stratigraphic
36 ranges of each taxon, with arrows indicated lower confidence in stratigraphic boundaries. Stratigraphic
37 range data was derived from published accounts for each taxon, including global ranges. Geologic time scale
38 based on Cohen et al. [61]. Absence or presence of pneumatization is indicated by bar color (blue for
39 absence, purple for presence). Labelled circles denote node-based clades. Abbreviations: Aquitan.,
40 Aquitanian; H., Holocene; Langh., Langhian; Mess., Messinian; P., Piacenzian; Ple., Pleistocene; Plioc.,
41 Pliocene; Serra., Serravallian; Zan., Zanclean. The right tree shows the evolution of supraorbital crest size
42 in platanistoids, calculated as a percentage of bizygomatic width, and binned by 4 color values. See
Supplementary Table 1 for dataset of crest measurements used.

Review by O. Lambert
I would like to thank and congratulate the authors for the effort they made to improve a manuscript that
was already of good quality. They responded to all the queries pointed by the reviewers, and in the few
cases where they decided not to follow our recommendations they provided arguments.
We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful and thorough comments, all of which have greatly helped to
improve the manuscript.
I find this second version of the text and figures greatly improved, and I could only find some very minor
issues, which I highlighted directly in the pdf of the ms. They include:
- Some suggestions for slight modifications in the text.
- A few remarks on the labeling of several figures, together with a proposal to slightly improve figure 8 in
a way to better match the corresponding discussion (stages of evolution of the supraorbital crests).
- I also noted a problem with the numbering of references. I did not check the whole list, but at least
some of the numbers in the text do not correspond to the references in the list.
Pending the correction of these last issues, I strongly recommend publication of this interesting paper in
Royal Society Open Science.
All of the corrections in the text and figures recommended by the reviewer have been considered and
corrected in the revised manuscript.
We would like to address one comment for clarity: pg. 17, comment by the reviewer in reference to
“…ventral-most point on orbit roof,”:
“sorry to bother you again with this. there may be some ambiguity retained here, as the ventral-most point
on the orbit roof may still be identified as the apex of the postorbital process. I think that what you mean
is the ventral-most point along a transverse line drawn at mid-length of the orbit roof, or something
similar.”
We would like to clarify that we included the postorbital process in our consideration of the supraorbital
crest, and in most cases the height of the supraorbital crest was measured from the dorsal-most point of
the crest to the ventral-most point (often the postorbital crest). We could find no other landmark on the
ventral surface of the crest that was more reliable—to have measured from the mid-point of the orbital
roof would, in many cases, include the fossa for the frontal lobe of the pterygoid sinus in the
measurement. As the fossa in more enlarged in some species than others, this would not have been a
reliable measurement. Except for some small variation within families (ex. Huaridelphis has a slightly shorter
postorbital process than other squalodelphinids), the variation in postorbital length is not large enough
among platanistoids to substantially affect our measurements, especially considering that the
measurements are broadly binned for visualization purposes in figure 7. This point has been clarified in the
manuscript text.
The references have also been double-checked for accuracy.
