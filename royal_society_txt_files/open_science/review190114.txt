The manuscript investigates the level in the visual system that the direction aftereffect (DAE)
occurs. The two levels investigated are the local (V1) and the global (V5) motion levels. These two
levels are teased apart by comparing the DAE tuning functions produced by a unikinetic plaid
and a sinewave grating. The perceived direction of a unikinetic plaid is in the direction of the
static grating and its perception has been linked to V5 and above. The logic of the study was that
if the DAE is driven by the local-motion cells, then the tuning function for the unikinetic plaid
should be relative to the local-motion direction (the direction of the moving grating) whereas if it
is driven by global-motion cells it should be relative to the plaid direction (parallel to the static
grating). Results clearly indicate that the plaid direction drives the DAE, and hence supports a
global-motion locus to the DAE.
This is an elegant study that nicely addresses the question of what level in the motion system
drives the DAE. The manuscript is well written and clear and I have no concerns with it.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors used drifting gratings and unikinetic plaids to assess whether DAE comes from the
local or global level of motion processing, and their findings support the global-level side. The
experiment was carefully conducted, but there seems to be a possible confound that needs to be
handled before the authors could draw such conclusion. Along this line, the authors may want to
present more data in order to draw a more convincing conclusion (currently, there are only data
3
from one experiment…). Also, the writing (especially in terms of connecting the present study
with the literature) and some analyses needs to be improved. Below I list the major and minor
issues to be addressed by the authors.
Major issues:
1. drifting speed of the component as a confound: The authors were careful in controlling the
component drifting speed in the unikinetic condition to produce the same perceived pattern
speed across different adaptor directions. But that means the component drifting speed varied
across adaptor directions, which was an obvious confound. One way to address the issue is to
rerun the unikinetic condition with constant component drifting speed so that the pattern speed
varied across adaptor directions. If the results were similar with the original unikinetic condition,
then the main driving factor should be the “perceived pattern direction of the adaptor”. But if the
results were different, it may require further investigation.
2. a loosely-connected Discussion: The author may consider focusing the Discussion on
discussing the present study and the results, especially the limitations of the experiments.
Currently, some of the Discussion (especially the first and second paragraphs) sounds like
repeating some parts of the Introduction in reviewing previous findings, with no connection to
the present study.
For example, the authors may want to suggest how readers can reconcile the apparently
contradictory conclusions drawn in the present study and that in Curran et al. (2006). Also, the
definition for “global” and “local” may need further clarification, as, currently, “global” only
refers to the “pattern direction from a plaid”, without addressing other “global” characteristics
such as cross-location integration, large receptive field size, etc. Lastly, the authors may want to
include two relevant studies from Tony Movshons lab to enrich the discussion/intro (Majaj,
Carandini, and Movshon, 2007, which shows that motion integration in MT could be location-
specific; and Tailby, Majaj, and Movshon, 2010, which may be related to the authors’ discussion
on interocular transfer of DAE).
3. inadequate analysis and interpretation on the results: First, there seems to be a significant
difference in DAE in between baseline and unikinetic at 67.5 degrees (i.e., the rightmost bar in
each of the two figures). The author should report the test of difference and provide potential
explanation if the difference is significant (which, I suppose, is the case, by eyeballing the graphs).
Second, if this difference is indeed significant, they authors may want to comment on the overall
trend of the DAE, especially in the baseline condition, because it was not consistent with those in
the literature, in which DAE typically peaks at 45 degrees (e.g., Schrater and Simoncelli, 1998).
4. How about bikinetic plaids? If DAE is driven by the “global-motion” detectors, a bikinetic
plaid with, say, upward and leftward drifting components with identical speed should signal a
45-degree top-left global motion direction. If an observer adapts to this bikinetic pattern, there
should be significant DAE on a test stimulus presented at the upward (0-degree) direction. In
fact, I have a paper recently accepted by the Journal of Vision, addressing a very similar question
asked by the authors in the present study, but I used a different approach: a multiple-aperture
stimulus (Amano et al., 2009, JoV) with multiple global directions embedded in the adaptor (Lee
and Lu, 2014, AP&P). In one of the experiments, I used bikinetic plaid as both the adaptor and
test stimulus, but I did not find a stronger DAE when compared to a single-grating case (for both
adaptor and test). Although the general conclusion of my paper is in line with that of the present
study (that DAE relies on global-level adaptation, especially when tested with a global-level
stimulus), I believe this bikinetic plaid condition would be interesting to explore, and should be
discussed by the authors, given that they used plaid as their main stimulus.
Minor issues
- Page 10: for the unikinetic condition, why was the moving component drifted at 45 degrees only
4
in the 0-degree case? If I understand this correctly, a unikinetic plaid with a vertical static
orientation and an upward drifting component should still be perceived as moving upward. The
author would need to justify why they used a different tilt for the static orientation for the 0-
degree, unikinetic case, or rerun this case with the above-described setup, so that the 0-degree
case in the unikinetic condition could be more fairly compared with the other adaptor directions.
- What was the speed of the test RDK? This is an important piece of information because DAE is
speed-tuned, and this is somewhat related to the Major issue number 1 above.
- Some details about the procedure need to be added, e.g., exact number of trials in each block,
number of blocks completed by each observer, and the order of presentation of the adaptor
directions.
- There were both clockwise and counter-clockwise (relative to vertical) directions for the non-
vertical adaptors, but it was not described how these adaptor directions were presented. I
suppose they were alternated or at least randomized across different blocks, but this needs to be
clarified.
- I assume the authors took the estimated PSE as DAE magnitude. But this was not explicitly
mentioned in method or results. Please add it back.
- The doi link at the bottom of the manuscript does not work for me.

The manuscript looks much better and the issues I raised have been adequately addressed.
Just one minor but general point about the tone: the authors seem quite confident in various parts
in the manuscript that their results have definitively settled the debate (e.g., in Discussion, second
paragraph, "this points squarely to the DAE being driven by global motion adaptation"). But
apparently there are still some loose ends, e.g., as the authors acknowledged in discussing Curran
et al.'s (2006) results. However, this may be more of an issue about writing style, and I don't have

Appendix A
I have some concern that all the participants are authors, so it is possible in
principle for bias effects to contribute to the results. The psychophysical
method was not bias-free because the response was explicitly about the
perceived direction of the test pattern. It would be preferable to have data
for naïve participants as well.
The predictions are presented in a way that is difficult to understand. Plaid
adaptation stimuli were made by adding a static grating and a drifting grating
at different orientations. The apparent direction of such a plaid is always
parallel to the orientation of the static grating. In the four conditions
employed (which I refer to by number 1-4), the apparent direction of the
plaid should therefore be 0, 22, 45, and 67.5 deg with respect to vertical. The
actual direction of the drifting grating in these conditions was 45, 0, 0, 0 deg
respectively. Participants judged the apparent direction of a drifting random
dot test pattern relative to vertical. Thus if the DAE is driven by plaid
direction, it should be present in conditions 2, 3 and 4 but not in condition 1.
An outcome in favour of this prediction would point towards involvement of
MT or MST, according to the manuscript. If the DAE is driven by grating
direction, it should be present in condition 1 but not in conditions 2, 3, and 4.
This outcome would favour either V1 or MT. A baseline condition was also
performed, in which the stimulus contains a single drifting grating drifting at
0, 22, 45 or 67.5 deg.
Results clearly show a major contribution to adaptation from the plaid
direction. However, the claim that there is no effect of the local/grating
direction is not so convincing. This claim requires that results for the zero-
degree adapters in the baseline and plaid conditions should be the same, at
zero. On the other hand, the presence of a DAE at a plaid direction of 0 deg
would indicate some degree of adaptation to the 45 deg grating direction.
The SE bars suggest an above-zero effect in this plaid condition (Fig. 2b). The
results report a t-test that there was no significant effect in this condition. It
is not clear what this t-test tested. Given that the same participants took part
in all sessions, it would be possible to run a t-test to compare the zero deg
adapters in the baseline and plaid conditions. Is this the t value reported?
Perhaps more (naïve) participants would push this difference into
significance?
If adaptation involves multiple components at different levels, one might
expect some effect from the grating component. Indeed it could be argued
that there is so much evidence for adaptation at multiple levels of
adaptation, including V1 and MT, that it is too simplistic to present the
predictions in terms of an either-or dichotomy. There is evidence for
adaptation in V1, so why would this not contribute to the DAE at all?
It could be argued in reply that the grating by itself at 45 deg produced a
much larger effect (45 deg in the baseline condition, Fig 2a) than when it was
present in the plaid (0 deg in the plaid condition, Fig 2b), but this could
reflect the relative strengths of the two adapting components, as well as
some inhibitory interaction between the static component and the drifting
component. The point is at least worth debating.
Have the authors considered the possibility of an adaptation component
mediated by second-order motion sensors that encode pattern direction in
plaids? A number of papers, and a theoretical model, favour a role for
second-order sensors in plaid processing and adaptation effects (e.g. Wilson,
H. R., & Kim, J. 1994. A model for motion coherence and transparency. Visual
Neuroscience, 11(6), 1205-1220; papers by Nishida cited in the manuscript).
Appendix B
Response to Reviewers
(reviewers’ comments italicized)
Reviewer #1
Reviewer #1 did not request any additional details and had no concerns.
Reviewer #2
Reviewer # 2 raised the following major issues.
1. Drifting speed of the component as a confound: The authors were
careful in controlling the component drifting speed in the unikinetic condition
to produce the same perceived pattern speed across different adaptor
directions. But that means the component drifting speed varied across
adaptor directions, which was an obvious confound. One way to address the
issue is to rerun the unikinetic condition with constant component drifting
speed so that the pattern speed varied across adaptor directions. If the
results were similar with the original unikinetic condition, then the main
driving factor should be the “perceived pattern direction of the adaptor”. But
if the results were different, it may require further investigation.
Response. We have taken Reviewer #2’s advice and re-run the unikinetic
plaid condition while keeping component motion speed constant. The results
are very similar to the original unikinetic plaid experiment. Details of this
additional condition are included on pages 13 and 14.
2. A loosely-connected Discussion: The author may consider focusing the
Discussion on discussing the present study and the results, especially the
limitations of the experiments. Currently, some of the Discussion (especially
the first and second paragraphs) sounds like repeating some parts of the
Introduction in reviewing previous findings, with no connection to the present
study. For example, the authors may want to suggest how readers can
reconcile the apparently contradictory conclusions drawn in the present study
and that in Curran et al. (2006). Also, the definition for “global” and “local”
may need further clarification, as, currently, “global” only refers to the
“pattern direction from a plaid”, without addressing other “global”
characteristics such as cross-location integration, large receptive field size,
etc. Lastly, the authors may want to include two relevant studies from Tony
Movshons lab to enrich the discussion/intro (Majaj, Carandini, and Movshon,
2007, which shows that motion integration in MT could be location-specific;
and Tailby, Majaj, and Movshon, 2010, which may be related to the authors’
discussion on interocular transfer of DAE).
Response. We have turned our focus, as suggested, to the limitation of the
experiment – see also response to point 1, above, and response to Reviewer
#3’s point 1. We have attempted to reconcile the apparent conflict between
the current results and those of Curran et al. (2006), by appealing to Lee’s
(2008) point regarding local speed rather than local direction driving the DAE
reported by Curran et al. (2006). This is addressed on pages 16 and 17.
Reviewer #2 asked us for further clarification on the definitions for “global”
and “local”. In the Introduction we refer to the relationship between
receptive field size and local/global distinction in motion processing, and we
clearly emphasise that area MT+ is considered to be involved in global
motion processing. The key point of our experiment is examining whether or
not the DAE is determined by the pattern motion direction of unikinetic plaid
adaptors, and thus driven by adaptation of motion-sensitive mechanisms in
area MT+. Reviewer #2 also suggests we may wish to include two studies
from Movshon’s lab. These studies are certainly interesting, and we now
refer to them in the first paragraph of the Introduction.
3. Inadequate analysis and interpretation on the results: First, there
seems to be a significant difference in DAE in between baseline and unikinetic
at 67.5 degrees (i.e., the rightmost bar in each of the two figures). The author
should report the test of difference and provide potential explanation if the
difference is significant (which, I suppose, is the case, by eyeballing the
graphs). Second, if this difference is indeed significant, they authors may
want to comment on the overall trend of the DAE, especially in the baseline
condition, because it was not consistent with those in the literature, in which
DAE typically peaks at 45 degrees (e.g., Schrater and Simoncelli, 1998).
Response. Reviewer #2 is correct in pointing out that there is a significant
difference between baseline and unikinetic at 67.5 degrees, which is now
reported. While we have not speculated on why the baseline condition does
not peak at the same point as the unikinetic condition, we have established
(through additional testing) that it does indeed peak and, consistent with
previous reports, the observed DAE tuning function describes an inverted-U
shape. This is addressed in the second paragraph of page 13.
4. How about bikinetic plaids? If DAE is driven by the “global-motion”
detectors, a bikinetic plaid with, say, upward and leftward drifting
components with identical speed should signal a 45-degree top-left global
motion direction. If an observer adapts to this bikinetic pattern, there should
be significant DAE on a test stimulus presented at the upward (0-degree)
direction. In fact, I have a paper recently accepted by the Journal of Vision,
addressing a very similar question asked by the authors in the present study,
but I used a different approach: a multiple-aperture stimulus (Amano et al.,
2009, JoV) with multiple global directions embedded in the adaptor (Lee and
Lu, 2014, AP&P). In one of the experiments, I used bikinetic plaid as both the
adaptor and test stimulus, but I did not find a stronger DAE when compared
to a single-grating case (for both adaptor and test). Although the general
conclusion of my paper is in line with that of the present study (that DAE
relies on global-level adaptation, especially when tested with a global-level
stimulus), I believe this bikinetic plaid condition would be interesting to
explore, and should be discussed by the authors, given that they used plaid as
their main stimulus.
Response. As recommended by Reviewer #2, we now include a paragraph in
which we discuss how bikinetic plaid adaptors could be used to address the
same question. This is covered in the penultimate paragraph of the
Discussion.
Reviewer #2 raised the following minor issues.
1. Page 10: for the unikinetic condition, why was the moving component
drifted at 45 degrees only in the 0-degree case? If I understand this correctly,
a unikinetic plaid with a vertical static orientation and an upward drifting
component should still be perceived as moving upward. The author would
need to justify why they used a different tilt for the static orientation for the
0-degree, unikinetic case, or rerun this case with the above-described setup,
so that the 0-degree case in the unikinetic condition could be more fairly
compared with the other adaptor directions.
Response. This configuration permits us to test whether the component
motion contributes to the DAE. If we had used a configuration in which the
component motion drifted upwards we would not be able to test if it
contributed to the DAE, since the test stimulus direction was also upwards.
We have re-written the final paragraph in the Introduction to help clarify this
point.
2. What was the speed of the test RDK? This is an important piece of
information because DAE is speed-tuned, and this is somewhat related to the
Major issue number 1 above.
Response. The speed of the test RDK was 3° s-1 – the same as the adaptor’s
pattern speed. This information is now included at end of the third paragraph
page 9.
3. Some details about the procedure need to be added, e.g., exact
number of trials in each block, number of blocks completed by each observer,
and the order of presentation of the adaptor directions.
Response. The relevant details have been added to the Procedure section.
4. There were both clockwise and counter-clockwise (relative to vertical)
directions for the non-vertical adaptors, but it was not described how these
adaptor directions were presented. I suppose they were alternated or at least
randomized across different blocks, but this needs to be clarified.
Response. Yes, they were randomized across different blocks. This
information is now in the Procedure.
5. I assume the authors took the estimated PSE as DAE magnitude. But
this was not explicitly mentioned in method or results. Please add it back.
Response. DAE magnitude was calculated as the angular difference between
the PSE and vertical upwards. This information has been included in the
Procedure.
6. The doi link at the bottom of the manuscript does not work for me.
Response. The Doi link has been fixed, although it appears that it will only be
activated when the manuscript is accepted.
Reviewer #3
Reviewer #3 raised the following issues.
1. I have some concern that all the participants are authors, so it is
possible in principle for bias effects to contribute to the results. The
psychophysical method was not bias-free because the response was explicitly
about the perceived direction of the test pattern. It would be preferable to
have data for naïve participants as well.
Response. We have tested three naïve participants. The results remain
unchanged.
2. Results clearly show a major contribution to adaptation from the plaid
direction. However, the claim that there is no effect of the local/grating
direction is not so convincing. This claim requires that results for the zero-
degree adapters in the baseline and plaid conditions should be the same, at
zero. On the other hand, the presence of a DAE at a plaid direction of 0 deg
would indicate some degree of adaptation to the 45 deg grating direction.
The SE bars suggest an above-zero effect in this plaid condition (Fig. 2b). The
results report a t-test that there was no significant effect in this condition. It
is not clear what this t-test tested. Given that the same participants took part
in all sessions, it would be possible to run a t-test to compare the zero deg
adapters in the baseline and plaid conditions. Is this the t value reported?
Perhaps more (naïve) participants would push this difference into
significance?
Response. The non-significant t-value reported refers to a repeated
measures t-test comparing performance following presentation of the zero
degree adapters in the baseline and plaid conditions. This is now explicitly
stated in the Results section. As recommended by reviewer #3, we tested
three additional naïve participants and the result was still not significant.
3. If adaptation involves multiple components at different levels, one
might expect some effect from the grating component. Indeed it could be
argued that there is so much evidence for adaptation at multiple levels of
adaptation, including V1 and MT, that it is too simplistic to present the
predictions in terms of an either-or dichotomy. There is evidence for
adaptation in V1, so why would this not contribute to the DAE at all?
It could be argued in reply that the grating by itself at 45 deg produced a
much larger effect (45 deg in the baseline condition, Fig 2a) than when it was
present in the plaid (0 deg in the plaid condition, Fig 2b), but this could reflect
the relative strengths of the two adapting components, as well as some
inhibitory interaction between the static component and the drifting
component. The point is at least worth debating.
Response. We agreed with Reviewer #3 that, given the evidence for
adaptation at multiple levels of adaptation, one might expect adaptation in
V1 to contribute to the observed DAE. We raise this possibility in the final
paragraph of the Introduction, and argue in the Discussion (second
paragraph of page 16) that there is no evidence that the component motion
contributed to the DAE. If it did contribute to the effect, then we would
expect DAE magnitude to differ in the baseline and unikinetic plaid
conditions. However, as discussed in the Results, there was no significant
difference between the baseline and plaid conditions for three of the four
directions tested (0°, 22.5° and 66.7°); this suggests that the observed DAE
was not a consequence of an interaction between the component and
pattern motions, but was driven by the pattern motion.
4. Have the authors considered the possibility of an adaptation
component mediated by second-order motion sensors that encode pattern
direction in plaids? A number of papers, and a theoretical model, favour a
role for second-order sensors in plaid processing and adaptation effects (e.g.
Wilson, H. R., & Kim, J. 1994. A model for motion coherence and
transparency. Visual Neuroscience, 11(6), 1205-1220; papers by Nishida cited
in the manuscript).
Response. We had not considered this possibility in the current paper, partly
because the experiment was not addressing this specific question about the
role of second-order sensors in plaid processing. While a number of papers
suggest such a role for second-order sensors, our data do not speak directly
to this question and we feel that any attempt to do so would be speculative
and beyond the remit of the paper.
