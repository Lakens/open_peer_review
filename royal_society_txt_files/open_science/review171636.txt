This is an interesting study about how intrauterine interactions affect cortisol expression, where
litters with more even sex ratios have higher rates of cortisol expression than litters with more
extreme sex ratios.
1. The discussion is rather superficial at times and does not really delve into the underlying
mechanism which results in the association between an even litter sex ratio and cortisol, apart
from the rather cryptic “Perhaps in mammals, cortisol is involved in maintaining even-sex ratios
through stabilizing selection” (L188-191).
Why does cortisol have such a function? If cortisol benefits development (as stated by the authors
in lines 192-203) then all broods should have been selected to express higher cortisol levels
regardless of their sex ratio, but that clearly did not happen. Hence, cortisol expression is likely to
be enhanced when both oestradiol (from female fetuses) and testosterone (from male fetuses) are
present in sufficient amounts. It would be great if authors could delve a bit more into the
potential mechanisms for this, rather than existing explanations listed in L180-191.
2. The authors should do more to convince the reader that cortisol effects are not due to litter size,
but are, in fact, caused by the sex ratio. From L114-120, the reader gets the impression that the
polynomial regressions do not correct for litter size and that litter size is only used to explain the
number of fetuses adjacent to an opposite sex fetus. However, more extreme litter sex ratios can
simply be a statistical corollary of being in a smaller litter (binomial sampling), so that the actual
underlying variable underlying lower cortisol levels may well be litter size instead of sex ratio. It
should be straightforward to correct for this, by adding litter size to the polynomial regression.
3. L136-140: One performs multiple tests on the same data (and hence one should correct for
inflation of p values) when one performs one test with averages across littermates and another
where individual fetuses are analysed. I do not see why just a single test (the one with individual
fetuses) is not sufficient here. If one wants to learn from litter averages, one can always examine
the random intercepts of the model. Moreover, just one R^2 value, rather than two values, is
convincing enough here.
4. in general, it would be good to see the tables of the most important statistical tests (or in the
online supplement), so that it is clear which variables are used in which analysis, their effect sizes
(perhaps transformed back to their original, untransformed scale) and partial R^2s.
Minor comments:
L118, 122: Linear mix <U+2192> Linear mixed
L119-120: “(as a polynomial to second degree)”. Why is this necessary? As sex ratio is an
independent variable here
L122: “was corrected for” is a bit ambiguous. One should explicitly state here that you take the
residuals of that regression of fetuses adjacent to an opposite-sex fetus on litter size.
3
L124-126: “Fetal weights did not distribute normaly due to a higher representation of fetuses
from early gestation age, since these litters are naturally larger”.
But why not use a box-cox transformation to see whether a transformation to normality is not
possible?
Throughout: it should at least be verbally reported whether overdispersion was absent in the
regression models.

The paper by Fishman et al. examines the effects of litter sex ratio, determined in utero, on
cortisol levels and morphological traits of fetuses in the nutria. This paper addresses a highly
interesting and relevant topic especially because there is a lack of studies on the physiological
consequences of litter sex ratio. However, in my opinion a couple of issues preclude the paper’s
publication in its present form.
1- First, I do not understand why Johnson transformations were applied to hair cortisol levels (l.
109-111). The normality assumption for linear regression applies to the errors, not the dependent
variable. Moreover, independence and homoscedasticity are more important assumptions than
normality.
2- The authors used residual transformed cortisol with the aim of controlling for pregnancy age
(l. 111-114). This procedure has been widely condemned in the statistical literature since the
residuals themselves are estimated with error (e.g. Freckleton 2002). Why not simply have
pregnancy age as a fixed effect in the multiple regression model?
3- Linear mix models were used to explain the number of fetuses adjacent to an opposite-sex fetus
(l. 118-119). Given the nature of the dependent variable, Poisson regression is far more
appropriate.
4- The literature on the long-term fitness consequences of litter sex composition, which is cited in
this paper, comes almost exclusively from humans. However, several studies on a variety of
vertebrates suggest that interactions between males and females in mixed-sexed litters or broods
can have consequences for birth mass, survival and reproduction. An extended literature review
is clearly needed.
More specific comments:
“It is argued that the production of an equal number of male and female offspring by individual
parents should be favoured by selection” (l. 12-14). This is not true when sons and daughters
impose different costs on parents and when juvenile mortality is sex-specific during the period of
parental care.
“In humans, twin studies show a fitness advantage for fetuses and neonates of opposite-sex twins
compared to same-sex twins, also in dizygotics” (l. 33-35). The opposite result occurs in some
species. For instance, in Soay sheep selection is expected to favor females that produce same-sex
litters (Korsten et al. 2009). See my fourth comment.
It should be explicitly stated somewhere in the introduction that when the offspring’s fitness is
dependent on the sex composition of the litter, selection may favor maternal adjustments of sex
ratio.
“Estimation of pregnancy age followed Newson (1966)” (l. 70). Please to add sufficient details for
the inexperienced reader.
L. 79. Replace “Fer” with “For”.
l. 54-56. See Douhard (2017) for a recent synthesis.
L. 122-124. I am not sure to understand the full model for fetal length. I would appreciate that the
authors give the structure of this model by specifying modalities for each factor?

Hope this helps.

Comments to the Author(s)

I thought this was a really thought-provoking and interesting result – well done! However, I
thought the hypothesis needed more theoretical development, and there were other weaknesses
that I outline below.
1. The introduction ends on ‘testing the opposite’ of the introductory material. I would like to see
a clear theoretical development of why you would propose that a) cortisol would be elevated in
mixed sex litters, and b) why this would be advantageous. This could then end on a clearly
developed hypothesis that you are testing with your study.
2. How closely do these offspring cortisol measurements match those of the mother? Are they
6
also elevated in larger vs smaller litters? Extrapolating from your figures, for example, suggests
that your most strongly female biased (say those with sex ratio 0.3 or less) and your strongly male
biased litters (e.g. those 0.67 or greater) seemed to have a smaller litter size than the more even
sex ratio litters (extrapolated average litter size: Female-biased ~4.8; male-biased ~ 4.4, even-ish ~
6.1). Larger litters might be predicted to increase maternal stress levels, which, during late
gestation, will be transferred to the offspring. It’s not clear to me how this was controlled to be
sure that it was the sex ratio not the litter size (and maternal stress levels) that was the main
driver of this effect.
3. Did you find evidence of selective abortion as previously documented in this species (Gosling
1986 Am Nat 127: 772-795).
4. I like the argument that the cortisol would enhance development, as shown with the use of
synthetics GCs in the treatment of premature babies. However, there are documented negative
effects of high GCs in late gestation, including on, for example, reactions to stress, submissive
behavior, and even metabolic diseases. These should be discussed as they may represent trade-
offs to faster growth.
5. Methods: I know there is a space limitation, but several factors are not clearly described.
a. I would like more information on how pregnancy age was determined – I was unable to locate
a copy of the reference used here. It is important, since size is used as a response variable, and
therefore we need to know how size was used to calculate pregnancy age. Furthermore, levels of
cortisol in the fetus are age and stage of development related, so they could be influenced by your
estimates of fetal age.
b. There is no description of how uterine position was determined during dissection, and how
accurate this is likely to be.
c. I wondered why testosterone was not measured from hair samples, as intrauterine effects of
testosterone in relation to the sex of neighbours has been reported previously. Indeed, I felt like
the literature on intrauterine position in rodents was under-referenced in the discussion and
introduction. Was there also a uterine horn effect?
d. I wondered whether you could test sex ratio effects within a mother by investigating the sex
ratios in the individual uterine horns? If you had different skews in the two horns you could test
if a more even sex ratio resulted in higher cort levels and higher growth and this would enable
you to control for maternal effects. Now usre if you have the sample size to do this, but it seemed
like one way you could approach the question.
6. I thought the result that your end of uterine horn individuals were larger, but did not have
higher cort was interesting. It shows that higher cort is not the only factor enhancing growth. The
crowding suggestion points to a potential role of litter size, with a potential interaction between
litter size, sex of offspring and maternal ability to invest. I would like to see this explored further.

General Comments
This paper presents correlational data regarding fetal cortisol and offspring sex-ratio in utero in
nutria. This is an important topic within evolutionary theory, unfortunately the paper provides a
superficial discussion of sex-ratio theory. The authors also frequently conflate functional and
ultimate explanations. In systems with chromosomal sex determination, even sex-ratios are
predicted. Populations are expected to have a mean sex-ratio at parity, while the population
distribution would be binomial. They do not require a further mechanism to be maintained.
However, if the population distribution is sub-binomial or skewed, that would require
explanation. The authors need to clearly outline this theory and make a distinction between mean
sex-ratio and the population distribution. For example, the authors have not tested whether their
population distribution differs from binomial or provide broader evidence of this being the case
in nutria. However, they do state that the sex-ratio distribution is normal. This information is
only in a figure legend despite it being a fundamental question within their study; does your
population sex-ratio differ from the binomial distribution? If it does this requires both an ultimate
and functional explanation. Why is this selected for? What is the mechanism that causes a
difference from the predicted sex-ratio? Also, they report fetal cortisol measured from hair, but I
would imagine it is impossible to assess whether this is produced by the fetus or linked to
maternal circulating levels. If they also had data regarding maternal cortisol this would be
helpful. Therefore, they cannot state unequivocally that cortisol measured is produced by the
fetus.
I am unconvinced by the results presented. I have major issues with how the data have been
analyzed, and the description of the analyses is muddled. It is unclear what has been controlled
for and which factors are dependent and independent within the models. I am mostly concerned
with whether litter size and maternal condition are linked to sex-ratio. Is it in fact larger litters
that have more equal sex-ratios, higher probability of fetuses having ad opposite sex neighbour,
longer body length and higher cortisol? In that case is it a product of female condition? To test
this, I would suggest using a GLMM with binomial error structure (sex-ratio data are non-normal
it is bound between 0 and 1), where sex-ratio is the dependent factor, with cortisol (corrected for
pregnancy stage or have pregnancy stage as a factor), litter size and maternal condition (size) as
explanatory variables. As described in Statistical analysis of sex ratios: an introduction. / Wilson,
Kenneth; Hardy, I. C. W. Sex ratios: concepts and research methods. ed. / I. C. W. Hardy.
Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 48-92.
The paper also suffers from pseudoreplication, fetuses within litters are not independent data
points. It is not possible to infer statistical significance when maternal identity has not been
accounted for. All analyses from line 145 do not account for pseudoreplication, shown by the
residual df that are greater than the total number of mothers (litters) described in the methods
lines 64-69. They also conduct multiple tests, when a number of these factors should be included
in a signal model. Putting statistical results into a table would help clarify methods.
8
The data certainly do not provide evidence of a causal role of cortisol in sex-ratio manipulation.
As the sex-ratio data is taken from culled animals there is also no information about the survival
of fetuses from litters of different sex-ratios. Therefore, no way to assess whether litters of an
equal sex -atio have greater fitness, or simply better survival to post-partum stages. And there is
no discussion about whether mothers with higher cortisol are more likely to be caught and
culled.
They also neglect any discussion of other hormones such as testosterone/estrogen which have
been shown to influence offspring phenotype and future fitness due to the sex-ratio of the litter
and the sex of the immediate neighbour in utero.
Specific comments
Unfortunately, the quality of the English throughout is poor.
Pregnancy age is used throughout would be clearer to state pregnancy stage (days).
Abstract
Muddled logic - what are your hypotheses?
Introduction
Again, muddled logic, really the authors need to fully describe sex allocation theory, and how it
related to their study. Although their description of the role of glucocorticoids during fetal
development is good.
Methods
Line 118: These are commonly referred to as Linear Mixed Models not Linear mix models.
Results
Line 139: resdidual df of 25? Did you control for litter size or maternal condition, maternal age?
Line 145: Fetuses neighbouring an opposite sex exhibited longer trunks than those neighbouring
the same sex, which might imply better lung development. But this was confounded by litter size
and maternal quality? Maternal ID not controlled for.
Lines 157-163: Despite the title of the paper there is no evidence presented that fetuses
neighbouring an opposite-sex fetus in utero conveys a "cortisol advantage". Fetuses neighbouring
opposite-sex littermates had higher hair cortisol levels than those next to same-sex fetuses.
However, this relationship may be driven by the fact that litters with even-sex ratios had higher
cortisol overall, as once maternal or litter identity was considered, no significant differences were
found. It is not impossible to interpret results where maternal identity and litter size have not
been controlled for.
Discussion
Line 215: Need to explain the over production of same sex litters, not the maintenance of even-sex
ratio, which would be predicted under chromosomal sex determination.
Line 216: Sex-selective abortion and fetal resorption can be mechanisms for adjusting sex ratios,
and might explain the underrepresentation of unisex litters in nature, contrary to binomial
expectations. While there is evidence that some mammalian populations have population sex-
ratios that are more equal than would be expected under a binomial distribution, this is not
common. Is there more evidence than one study from the 1980s that provides evidence for this?
9
Line 219: What causes even-sex litters to have higher cortisol relative to skewed-sex ratio litters?
As the animals were killed before the birth of offspring it is unclear whether the sex-ratio predicts
offspring survival. This requires discussion and is a major limitation of the study.

dependent on the sex composition of the litter, selection may favor maternal adjustments of sex
ratio.
“Estimation of pregnancy age followed Newson (1966)” (l. 70). Please to add sufficient details for
the inexperienced reader.

L. 122-124. I am not sure to understand the full model for fetal length. I would appreciate that the
authors give the structure of this model by specifying modalities for each factor?
Hope this helps.

Comments to the Author(s)
I thought this was a really thought-provoking and interesting result – well done! However, I
thought the hypothesis needed more theoretical development, and there were other weaknesses
that I outline below.
1. The introduction ends on ‘testing the opposite’ of the introductory material. I would like to see
a clear theoretical development of why you would propose that a) cortisol would be elevated in
mixed sex litters, and b) why this would be advantageous. This could then end on a clearly
developed hypothesis that you are testing with your study.
2. How closely do these offspring cortisol measurements match those of the mother? Are they
also elevated in larger vs smaller litters? Extrapolating from your figures, for example, suggests
that your most strongly female biased (say those with sex ratio 0.3 or less) and your strongly male
biased litters (e.g. those 0.67 or greater) seemed to have a smaller litter size than the more even
sex ratio litters (extrapolated average litter size: Female-biased ~4.8; male-biased ~ 4.4, even-ish ~
6.1). Larger litters might be predicted to increase maternal stress levels, which, during late
gestation, will be transferred to the offspring. It’s not clear to me how this was controlled to be
sure that it was the sex ratio not the litter size (and maternal stress levels) that was the main
driver of this effect.
3. Did you find evidence of selective abortion as previously documented in this species (Gosling
1986 Am Nat 127: 772-795).
4. I like the argument that the cortisol would enhance development, as shown with the use of
synthetics GCs in the treatment of premature babies. However, there are documented negative
effects of high GCs in late gestation, including on, for example, reactions to stress, submissive
behavior, and even metabolic diseases. These should be discussed as they may represent trade-
offs to faster growth.
5. Methods: I know there is a space limitation, but several factors are not clearly described.
a. I would like more information on how pregnancy age was determined – I was unable to locate
a copy of the reference used here. It is important, since size is used as a response variable, and
therefore we need to know how size was used to calculate pregnancy age. Furthermore, levels of
cortisol in the fetus are age and stage of development related, so they could be influenced by your
estimates of fetal age.
b. There is no description of how uterine position was determined during dissection, and how
accurate this is likely to be.
c. I wondered why testosterone was not measured from hair samples, as intrauterine effects of
testosterone in relation to the sex of neighbours has been reported previously. Indeed, I felt like
the literature on intrauterine position in rodents was under-referenced in the discussion and
introduction. Was there also a uterine horn effect?
d. I wondered whether you could test sex ratio effects within a mother by investigating the sex
ratios in the individual uterine horns? If you had different skews in the two horns you could test
if a more even sex ratio resulted in higher cort levels and higher growth and this would enable
you to control for maternal effects. Now usre if you have the sample size to do this, but it seemed
like one way you could approach the question.
6. I thought the result that your end of uterine horn individuals were larger, but did not have
higher cort was interesting. It shows that higher cort is not the only factor enhancing growth. The
crowding suggestion points to a potential role of litter size, with a potential interaction between
litter size, sex of offspring and maternal ability to invest. I would like to see this explored further.

General Comments
This paper presents correlational data regarding fetal cortisol and offspring sex-ratio in utero in
nutria. This is an important topic within evolutionary theory, unfortunately the paper provides a
superficial discussion of sex-ratio theory. The authors also frequently conflate functional and
ultimate explanations. In systems with chromosomal sex determination, even sex-ratios are
predicted. Populations are expected to have a mean sex-ratio at parity, while the population
distribution would be binomial. They do not require a further mechanism to be maintained.
However, if the population distribution is sub-binomial or skewed, that would require
explanation. The authors need to clearly outline this theory and make a distinction between mean
sex-ratio and the population distribution. For example, the authors have not tested whether their
population distribution differs from binomial or provide broader evidence of this being the case
in nutria. However, they do state that the sex-ratio distribution is normal. This information is
only in a figure legend despite it being a fundamental question within their study; does your
population sex-ratio differ from the binomial distribution? If it does this requires both an ultimate
and functional explanation. Why is this selected for? What is the mechanism that causes a
difference from the predicted sex-ratio? Also, they report fetal cortisol measured from hair, but I
would imagine it is impossible to assess whether this is produced by the fetus or linked to
maternal circulating levels. If they also had data regarding maternal cortisol this would be
helpful. Therefore, they cannot state unequivocally that cortisol measured is produced by the
fetus.
I am unconvinced by the results presented. I have major issues with how the data have been
analyzed, and the description of the analyses is muddled. It is unclear what has been controlled
for and which factors are dependent and independent within the models. I am mostly concerned
with whether litter size and maternal condition are linked to sex-ratio. Is it in fact larger litters
that have more equal sex-ratios, higher probability of fetuses having ad opposite sex neighbour,
longer body length and higher cortisol? In that case is it a product of female condition? To test
this, I would suggest using a GLMM with binomial error structure (sex-ratio data are non-normal
it is bound between 0 and 1), where sex-ratio is the dependent factor, with cortisol (corrected for
pregnancy stage or have pregnancy stage as a factor), litter size and maternal condition (size) as
explanatory variables. As described in Statistical analysis of sex ratios: an introduction. / Wilson,
Kenneth; Hardy, I. C. W. Sex ratios: concepts and research methods. ed. / I. C. W. Hardy.
Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 48-92.
The paper also suffers from pseudoreplication, fetuses within litters are not independent data
points. It is not possible to infer statistical significance when maternal identity has not been
accounted for. All analyses from line 145 do not account for pseudoreplication, shown by the
residual df that are greater than the total number of mothers (litters) described in the methods
lines 64-69. They also conduct multiple tests, when a number of these factors should be included
in a signal model. Putting statistical results into a table would help clarify methods.
The data certainly do not provide evidence of a causal role of cortisol in sex-ratio manipulation.
As the sex-ratio data is taken from culled animals there is also no information about the survival
of fetuses from litters of different sex-ratios. Therefore, no way to assess whether litters of an
equal sex -atio have greater fitness, or simply better survival to post-partum stages. And there is
no discussion about whether mothers with higher cortisol are more likely to be caught and
culled.
They also neglect any discussion of other hormones such as testosterone/estrogen which have
16
been shown to influence offspring phenotype and future fitness due to the sex-ratio of the litter
and the sex of the immediate neighbour in utero.
Specific comments
Unfortunately, the quality of the English throughout is poor.
Pregnancy age is used throughout would be clearer to state pregnancy stage (days).
Abstract
Muddled logic - what are your hypotheses?
Introduction
Again, muddled logic, really the authors need to fully describe sex allocation theory, and how it
related to their study. Although their description of the role of glucocorticoids during fetal
development is good.
Methods
Line 118: These are commonly referred to as Linear Mixed Models not Linear mix models.
Results
Line 139: resdidual df of 25? Did you control for litter size or maternal condition, maternal age?
Line 145: Fetuses neighbouring an opposite sex exhibited longer trunks than those neighbouring
the same sex, which might imply better lung development. But this was confounded by litter size
and maternal quality? Maternal ID not controlled for.
Lines 157-163: Despite the title of the paper there is no evidence presented that fetuses
neighbouring an opposite-sex fetus in utero conveys a "cortisol advantage". Fetuses neighbouring
opposite-sex littermates had higher hair cortisol levels than those next to same-sex fetuses.
However, this relationship may be driven by the fact that litters with even-sex ratios had higher
cortisol overall, as once maternal or litter identity was considered, no significant differences were
found. It is not impossible to interpret results where maternal identity and litter size have not
been controlled for.
Discussion
Line 215: Need to explain the over production of same sex litters, not the maintenance of even-sex
ratio, which would be predicted under chromosomal sex determination.
Line 216: Sex-selective abortion and fetal resorption can be mechanisms for adjusting sex ratios,
and might explain the underrepresentation of unisex litters in nature, contrary to binomial
expectations. While there is evidence that some mammalian populations have population sex-
ratios that are more equal than would be expected under a binomial distribution, this is not
common. Is there more evidence than one study from the 1980s that provides evidence for this?
Line 219: What causes even-sex litters to have higher cortisol relative to skewed-sex ratio litters?
As the animals were killed before the birth of offspring it is unclear whether the sex-ratio predicts
offspring survival. This requires discussion and is a major limitation of the study.

label_comment_5
I have only minor comments:
L139: What do the residuals here refer to? As reviewer 2 has pointed out, it is not a good idea to
use residuals in subsequent analyses. Yet, Tables 1, 2 have litter size in it, so no residuals are used
here. Please clarify.
L143: Add that this is the ratio of deviance to df.
L202-204: “Perhaps in mammals, cortisol is involved in maintaining even-sex ratios through
stabilizing selection, where its ‘protective’ effect enhances development in mixed-sex litters,
though at this stage, we cannot disentangle cause and effect.”
I think still more work is needed from the authors on this paragraph, and more than just a single
sentence. So far, only the ‘cause’ part has been addressed in that sentence, whereas the ‘effect’
part has been left up to the reader. It would be good to make explicit here that more even litter
sex ratios and well-mixed intrauterine positions result in a different balance of male and female
specific hormones than when there is an extreme litter sex ratio. The former hormone balance
may well be more beneficial to development than the latter, particularly as even litter sex ratios
are likely to be more commonly experienced, so that natural selection has a greater efficacy in
such a condition. Consequently, more ‘optimal’ patterns of cortisol expression are more likely to
be found the context of even litter sex ratios.
In addition, authors seem to almost exclusively associate high cortisol levels with stress.
However, this depends on the duration of stress. Chronic exposure to stress (perhaps due to a
persistent exposure to a suboptimal balance of male vs female hormones) actually can result in
very low cortisol levels, as receptors get desensitized. It would be good to state that the relation
18
between cortisol level and stress is not unidirectional and that hypocortisol expression is
pathological too: Fries et al. (2005). Psychoneuroendocrinology 30: 1010 - 1016 .

After careful consideration I believe this paper provides some interesting data regarding
gestational cortisol and fetal sex-ratio in nutria, but due to a lack of clarity regarding the
interpretation and discussion of findings, methods and statistics, I cannot recommend the
manuscript for publication.
While the authors have made an effort to rectify a few of the statistical issues, some areas in the
methods remain unclear. Furthermore, the simple set of results are convoluted making the
interpretation of those results difficult. Overall the article confuses ultimate and proximate
20
mechanisms throughout and does not explain the scientific background clearly. There are no
figures showing many findings, for example pregnancy stage and fetal cortisol, which is an
interesting finding.
Methods
Line 126: What test used? Significance?
Were GLMMs used? How were models validated? What happens if non-significant terms are
removed?
Results
Just use mean cortisol per litter or individual. It doesn’t add anything. Could add in the methods
the results are consistent using both methods.
A great deal of the results section would be clearer in the methods section. It is unnecessary in the
results section.
Line 154: How was this tested, statistical result?
Line 176: Was maternal CORT measured in hair samples as well? It is an interesting finding that
they are not related, are fetuses producing their own cortisol at this point in development?
Line 162 and 177: It looks like maternal ID has not been included here, due to the resid DoF? But
random effects are outlined below? Is maternal ID reflecting maternal size, would be more
interesting to include this in model?

Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting study about how intrauterine interactions affect cortisol expression, where
litters with more even sex ratios have higher rates of cortisol expression than litters with more
extreme sex ratios.
1. The discussion is rather superficial at times and does not really delve into the underlying
mechanism which results in the association between an even litter sex ratio and cortisol, apart
from the rather cryptic “Perhaps in mammals, cortisol is involved in maintaining even-sex ratios
through stabilizing selection” (L188-191).
We thank the reviewer for this comment. However, we do not actually know what the
underlying mechanism is and were careful not to speculate beyond what the literature may
suggest. In this revision we added more insight from our study into possible mechanisms that
underlie our observation of even-sex ratios (Lines 240-245).
Why does cortisol have such a function? If cortisol benefits development (as stated by the
authors in lines 192-203) then all broods should have been selected to express higher cortisol
levels regardless of their sex ratio, but that clearly did not happen. Hence, cortisol expression
is likely to be enhanced when both oestradiol (from female fetuses) and testosterone (from
male fetuses) are present in sufficient amounts. It would be great if authors could delve a bit
more into the potential mechanisms for this, rather than existing explanations listed in L180-
191.
The reviewer is right; however, we don’t know at this stage whether cortisol expression in utero
is enhanced by sufficient oestradiol and cortisol and could not find literature supporting this
suggestion. We have a methodological challenge measuring estradiol in hair, and culled
specimens circulating steroid levels would not reflect their natural concentrations.
2. The authors should do more to convince the reader that cortisol effects are not due to litter
size, but are, in fact, caused by the sex ratio. From L114-120, the reader gets the impression
that the polynomial regressions do not correct for litter size and that litter size is only used to
explain the number of fetuses adjacent to an opposite sex fetus. However, more extreme litter
sex ratios can simply be a statistical corollary of being in a smaller litter (binomial sampling), so
that the actual underlying variable underlying lower cortisol levels may well be litter size
instead of sex ratio. It should be straightforward to correct for this, by adding litter size to the
polynomial regression.
We thank the reviewer for pointing this oversight. We added litter size to the model, to show
that its contribution is not significant. Lines 155-159, 160-162, Table 1 and Table 2.
3. L136-140: One performs multiple tests on the same data (and hence one should correct for
inflation of p values) when one performs one test with averages across littermates and another
where individual fetuses are analysed. I do not see why just a single test (the one with
individual fetuses) is not sufficient here. If one wants to learn from litter averages, one can
always examine the random intercepts of the model. Moreover, just one R^2 value, rather than
two values, is convincing enough here.
Regarding the multiple testing, in this specific case we did not take an approach of multiple
random tests (where P value corrections e.g., Benjamini and Hochberg would be needed), but
rather demonstrated in two different approaches that the result is basically the same. Such a
posteriori approach does not call for correcting P values against false discovery rates. As for
showing two tests, the reviewer is correct that they are a bit redundant. However, we think that
showing both supports our result and demonstrates the robustness of our analysis. Even-sex
ratios were related to high levels of cortisol, both when examining average litter sex ratios in
general and with respect to individual fetuses. Thus, receiving the same results is
informational. We thus prefer to include both analysis in the revised version of the manuscript.
4. in general, it would be good to see the tables of the most important statistical tests (or in the
online supplement), so that it is clear which variables are used in which analysis, their effect
sizes (perhaps transformed back to their original, untransformed scale) and partial R^2s.
We thank the reviewer for this comment and have now added the tables.
Minor comments:
L118, 122: Linear mix <U+2192> Linear mixed
Done
L119-120: “(as a polynomial to second degree)”. Why is this necessary? As sex ratio is an
independent variable here
Since the relationship is not linear, we need to describe a polynomial relationship (see Tables
1,2).
L122: “was corrected for” is a bit ambiguous. One should explicitly state here that you take the
residuals of that regression of fetuses adjacent to an opposite-sex fetus on litter size.
We agree with the reviewer, and now state this clearly in lines 140-142.
L124-126: “Fetal weights did not distribute normally due to a higher representation of fetuses
from early gestation age, since these litters are naturally larger”.
But why not use a box-cox transformation to see whether a transformation to normality is not
possible?
We tried normalizing fetal weights using the box-cox transformation, to no avail.
Throughout: it should at least be verbally reported whether overdispersion was absent in the
regression models.
Overdispersion was absent from the regression models (tested where applicable; values
ranged from 0.349 to 1). We have included this in the text accordingly (lines 146-147).
L132: “average chronic” <U+2192> what does this mean?
Removed.
L133: “inter uterine” <U+2192> define
Thank you. We now fixed typo to intra-uterine.
L151, 152: “which is expected considering the genetic relationships between maternal and
offspring length”, but one does not perform a quantitative genetic analysis, so the effects could
be environmental as well. Indeed, life-history theory would predict a maternal effect on
offspring size whenever there are sibling interactions, as is the case here (e.g., Parker &
Begon (1986). Am. Nat. 128: 573-592. http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/284589).
True. We omitted genetic and added the reference (lines 170-171).
168: RELM <U+2192> REML?
Oops. Thanks.
Figure 1: are the confidence envelopes here 95% confidence intervals of the normalized data?
Please state so.
In the figure legend it states that the values are transformed cortisol values. We now mention
the confidence intervals in the figure legend.
L259: significantly
Done.

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper by Fishman et al. examines the effects of litter sex ratio, determined in utero, on
cortisol levels and morphological traits of fetuses in the nutria. This paper addresses a highly
interesting and relevant topic especially because there is a lack of studies on the physiological
consequences of litter sex ratio. However, in my opinion a couple of issues preclude the
paper’s publication in its present form.
1- First, I do not understand why Johnson transformations were applied to hair cortisol
levels (l. 109-111). The normality assumption for linear regression applies to the errors, not the
dependent variable. Moreover, independence and homoscedasticity are more important
assumptions than normality.
Yes, you are right, but we were trying to be due diligent and normalize the dependent variables
as best as we could.
2- The authors used residual transformed cortisol with the aim of controlling for
pregnancy age (l. 111-114). This procedure has been widely condemned in the statistical
literature since the residuals themselves are estimated with error (e.g. Freckleton 2002). Why
not simply have pregnancy age as a fixed effect in the multiple regression model?
The reviewer is right. This was a typo. We actually did not use residual transformed cortisol but
had pregnancy age as a fixed effect in the mode. All models are now displayed in tables.
3- Linear mix models were used to explain the number of fetuses adjacent to an
opposite-sex fetus (l. 118-119). Given the nature of the dependent variable, Poisson
regression is far more appropriate.
Thank you for the suggestion. We changed this model for a GLM with Poisson distribution
(lines 137-140, 171-173).
4- The literature on the long-term fitness consequences of litter sex composition, which
is cited in this paper, comes almost exclusively from humans. However, several studies on a
variety of vertebrates suggest that interactions between males and females in mixed-sexed
litters or broods can have consequences for birth mass, survival and reproduction. An
extended literature review is clearly needed.
Thanks for the comment. We have added the suggested literature along with a reference to a
comprehensive review on other non-human species in lines 231-236.
More specific comments:
“It is argued that the production of an equal number of male and female offspring by individual
parents should be favoured by selection” (l. 12-14). This is not true when sons and daughters
impose different costs on parents and when juvenile mortality is sex-specific during the period
of parental care.
True. We added the caveats (lines 12-14).
“In humans, twin studies show a fitness advantage for fetuses and neonates of opposite-sex
twins compared to same-sex twins, also in dizygotics” (l. 33-35). The opposite result occurs in
some species. For instance, in Soay sheep selection is expected to favor females that produce
same-sex litters (Korsten et al. 2009). See my fourth comment.
Added (line 36).
It should be explicitly stated somewhere in the introduction that when the offspring’s fitness is
dependent on the sex composition of the litter, selection may favor maternal adjustments of
sex ratio.
Added. Lines 31-33.
“Estimation of pregnancy age followed Newson (1966)” (l. 70). Please to add sufficient details
for the inexperienced reader.
Done. Lines 80-82.
L. 79. Replace “Fer” with “For”.
Done.
l. 54-56. See Douhard (2017) for a recent synthesis.
Done. Line 59.
L. 122-124. I am not sure to understand the full model for fetal length. I would appreciate that
the authors give the structure of this model by specifying modalities for each factor?
Yes, of course, a table with specific model parameters is now added (Table 3).
Hope this helps.
It does indeed, thank you very much!

Comments to the Author(s)
I thought this was a really thought-provoking and interesting result – well done! However, I
thought the hypothesis needed more theoretical development, and there were other
weaknesses that I outline below.
1. The introduction ends on ‘testing the opposite’ of the introductory material. I would
like to see a clear theoretical development of why you would propose that a) cortisol would be
elevated in mixed sex litters, and b) why this would be advantageous. This could then end on a
clearly developed hypothesis that you are testing with your study.
Thank you for this comment. We rewrote the last paragraph of the Introduction to clearly
outline our working hypothesis (lines 63-70).
2. How closely do these offspring cortisol measurements match those of the mother?
Are they also elevated in larger vs smaller litters?
We found no relationship between maternal and fetal cortisol, nor litter size and maternal
cortisol. We now include this information in lines 147-149 and 177-178. Litter size is now
included in all models, see Tables 1 and 2.
Extrapolating from your figures, for example, suggests that your most strongly female biased
(say those with sex ratio 0.3 or less) and your strongly male biased litters (e.g. those 0.67 or
greater) seemed to have a smaller litter size than the more even sex ratio litters (extrapolated
average litter size: Female-biased ~4.8; male-biased ~ 4.4, even-ish ~ 6.1). Larger litters might
be predicted to increase maternal stress levels, which, during late gestation, will be transferred
to the offspring. It’s not clear to me how this was controlled to be sure that it was the sex ratio
not the litter size (and maternal stress levels) that was the main driver of this effect.
The reviewer is right. However, once litter size was added to the model, it had no effect on
fetal cortisol levels. We now include litter size in the final model (despite its insignificant effect)
in order to control for its possible indirect effects, see details in Tables 1 and 2.
3. Did you find evidence of selective abortion as previously documented in this species
(Gosling 1986 Am Nat 127: 772-795).
Yes, we did. The result is actually in another manuscript under review in Behavioral Ecology
and Sociobiology. We found that sex ratios decreased with pregnancy age, suggesting that
male fetuses are aborted.
4. I like the argument that the cortisol would enhance development, as shown with the
use of synthetics GCs in the treatment of premature babies. However, there are documented
negative effects of high GCs in late gestation, including on, for example, reactions to stress,
submissive behavior, and even metabolic diseases. These should be discussed as they may
represent trade-offs to faster growth.
In the literature, GCs were not associated with faster growth. However, they have been shown
to have multiple positive effects on system maturation. On the other hand, the reviewer is
absolutely right that multiple negative effects have also been documented. These are now
mentioned in lines 219-223.
5. Methods: I know there is a space limitation, but several factors are not clearly
described.
a. I would like more information on how pregnancy age was determined – I was unable
to locate a copy of the reference used here. It is important, since size is used as a response
variable, and therefore we need to know how size was used to calculate pregnancy age.
Furthermore, levels of cortisol in the fetus are age and stage of development related, so they
could be influenced by your estimates of fetal age.
The reviewer is right, and more details are now added on pregnancy age and developmental
stage in lines 80-82.
b. There is no description of how uterine position was determined during dissection, and
how accurate this is likely to be.
We now added more details on the determination of uterine position. Luckily, the nutria uterus
is extremely organized and the fetal position is clearly seen. We now include details in lines
105-109.
c. I wondered why testosterone was not measured from hair samples, as intrauterine
effects of testosterone in relation to the sex of neighbours has been reported previously.
Indeed, I felt like the literature on intrauterine position in rodents was under-referenced in the
discussion and introduction. Was there also a uterine horn effect?
The reviewer is right. We now mention testosterone and intrauterine position in rodents in lines
231-238. We also plan to measure testosterone and uterine horn effects in the future.
d. I wondered whether you could test sex ratio effects within a mother by investigating
the sex ratios in the individual uterine horns? If you had different skews in the two horns you
could test if a more even sex ratio resulted in higher cort levels and higher growth and this
would enable you to control for maternal effects. Now usre if you have the sample size to do
this, but it seemed like one way you could approach the question.
We also think that the sex ratios in individual uterine horns are fascinating. However, we found
no differences in cortisol between the horns, which can be a result of our low sample size.
6. I thought the result that your end of uterine horn individuals were larger, but did not
have higher cort was interesting. It shows that higher cort is not the only factor enhancing
growth. The crowding suggestion points to a potential role of litter size, with a potential
interaction between litter size, sex of offspring and maternal ability to invest. I would like to see
this explored further.
Litter size has been included in all models, which are now presented in the tables, along with
sex ratios and maternal ID. We further discuss the possible effects of crowding on sex ratios in
the Discussion, in lines 240-245.

General Comments
This paper presents correlational data regarding fetal cortisol and offspring sex-ratio in utero in
nutria. This is an important topic within evolutionary theory, unfortunately the paper provides a
superficial discussion of sex-ratio theory. The authors also frequently conflate functional and
ultimate explanations. In systems with chromosomal sex determination, even sex-ratios are
predicted. Populations are expected to have a mean sex-ratio at parity, while the population
distribution would be binomial. They do not require a further mechanism to be maintained.
However, if the population distribution is sub-binomial or skewed, that would require
explanation. The authors need to clearly outline this theory and make a distinction between
mean sex-ratio and the population distribution. For example, the authors have not tested
whether their population distribution differs from binomial or provide broader evidence of this
being the case in nutria. However, they do state that the sex-ratio distribution is normal. This
information is only in a figure legend despite it being a fundamental question within their study;
does your population sex-ratio differ from the binomial distribution? If it does this requires both
an ultimate and functional explanation. Why is this selected for? What is the mechanism that
causes a difference from the predicted sex-ratio? Also, they report fetal cortisol measured from
hair, but I would imagine it is impossible to assess whether this is produced by the fetus or
linked to maternal circulating levels. If they also had data regarding maternal cortisol this would
be helpful. Therefore, they cannot state unequivocally that cortisol measured is produced by
the fetus.
We thank the reviewer for the questions. We now include some basic information about the
study population’s sex ratio and litter size in lines 79 and 129.
Additionally, we now included information on maternal cortisol, and the lack of association
between maternal and fetal cortisol. See lines 147-149 and 177-178.
I am unconvinced by the results presented. I have major issues with how the data have been
analyzed, and the description of the analyses is muddled. It is unclear what has been
controlled for and which factors are dependent and independent within the models. I am mostly
concerned with whether litter size and maternal condition are linked to sex-ratio. Is it in fact
larger litters that have more equal sex-ratios, higher probability of fetuses having ad opposite
sex neighbour, longer body length and higher cortisol? In that case is it a product of female
condition? To test this, I would suggest using a GLMM with binomial error structure (sex-ratio
data are non-normal it is bound between 0 and 1), where sex-ratio is the dependent factor,
with cortisol (corrected for pregnancy stage or have pregnancy stage as a factor), litter size
and maternal condition (size) as explanatory variables. As described in Statistical analysis of
sex ratios: an introduction. / Wilson, Kenneth; Hardy, I. C. W. Sex ratios: concepts and
research methods. ed. / I. C. W. Hardy. Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 48-
92.
Yes, thank you, the previous version had several methodological errors. Indeed, we did not
use residuals, but the methods suggested by Hardy in the cited book ‘Sex Ratios’. We now
fixed this and added the results tables to describe our model parameters more clearly. Litter
size was not a significant predictor of fetal cortisol.
The paper also suffers from pseudoreplication, fetuses within litters are not independent data
points. It is not possible to infer statistical significance when maternal identity has not been
accounted for. All analyses from line 145 do not account for pseudoreplication, shown by the
residual df that are greater than the total number of mothers (litters) described in the methods
lines 64-69. They also conduct multiple tests, when a number of these factors should be
included in a signal model. Putting statistical results into a table would help clarify methods.
Maternal ID has been included as a random effect when examining individual fetuses. We had
an error explaining our methods in the first submission, see lines 134-135 and 162. All stats
are also presented in Tables in this revision.
The data certainly do not provide evidence of a causal role of cortisol in sex-ratio manipulation.
As the sex-ratio data is taken from culled animals there is also no information about the
survival of fetuses from litters of different sex-ratios. Therefore, no way to assess whether
litters of an equal sex -atio have greater fitness, or simply better survival to post-partum
stages. And there is no discussion about whether mothers with higher cortisol are more likely
to be caught and culled.
Since our study used culled nutria, we had no way of validating the actual survival of the
fetuses following birth. We now relate to this issue in lines 257-261. Further, our samples
included low and high cortisol females with a normally distributed size range. Animals were
culled with a shotgun, and not caught in a trap. Thus, less of a bias was achieved.
They also neglect any discussion of other hormones such as testosterone/estrogen which
have been shown to influence offspring phenotype and future fitness due to the sex-ratio of the
litter and the sex of the immediate neighbour in utero.
Testosterone is indeed relevant, and we are planning on measuring in fetuses in the future.
We now mention testosterone’s role in intra-uterine position in lines 231-238. Currently we do
not have tools to measure hair estrogens because of their low concentrations.
Specific comments
Unfortunately, the quality of the English throughout is poor.
We had an English editor correct this revision.
Pregnancy age is used throughout would be clearer to state pregnancy stage (days).
Pregnancy stage in days was substituted throughout and more details were provided on how it
was determined in lines 80-82.
Abstract
Muddled logic - what are your hypotheses?
We added our hypothesis in lines 63-70.
Introduction
Again, muddled logic, really the authors need to fully describe sex allocation theory, and how it
related to their study. Although their description of the role of glucocorticoids during fetal
development is good.
We clarified our hypothesis in lines 63-70. As for the various possible ultimate forces shaping
sex ratios (Fisher, Triver-Willard’s, LRC etc.) we think that it is beyond the scope of this paper.
Our study is of course relevant to all of these hypotheses. However, our results do not support
a specific one. Focusing on sex allocation theory will confuse the reader and detract from our
main point – a more mechanistic approach.
Methods
Line 118: These are commonly referred to as Linear Mixed Models not Linear mix models.
Fixed.
Results
Line 139: resdidual df of 25? Did you control for litter size or maternal condition, maternal age?
Clarified in Table 1 and Table 2. We do not have information on maternal age. Maternal
cortisol was not associated with litter cortisol. See lines 147-149 and 177-178.
Line 145: Fetuses neighbouring an opposite sex exhibited longer trunks than those
neighbouring the same sex, which might imply better lung development. But this was
confounded by litter size and maternal quality? Maternal ID not controlled for.
Maternal ID was controlled for in all models, and litter size was included in all models. We
clarified this in lines 134-135 and 162, and in tables 1 and 2.
Lines 157-163: Despite the title of the paper there is no evidence presented that fetuses
neighbouring an opposite-sex fetus in utero conveys a "cortisol advantage". Fetuses
neighbouring opposite-sex littermates had higher hair cortisol levels than those next to same-
sex fetuses. However, this relationship may be driven by the fact that litters with even-sex
ratios had higher cortisol overall, as once maternal or litter identity was considered, no
significant differences were found. It is not impossible to interpret results where maternal
identity and litter size have not been controlled for.
The reviewer is right, and we have now removed this result.
Discussion
Line 215: Need to explain the over production of same sex litters, not the maintenance of
even-sex ratio, which would be predicted under chromosomal sex determination.
According to James (ref 66) we hold a different view than the reviewer on this topic, which is
that unisex litters are actually underrepresented in mammals (see also line 249).
Line 216: Sex-selective abortion and fetal resorption can be mechanisms for adjusting sex
ratios, and might explain the underrepresentation of unisex litters in nature, contrary to
binomial expectations. While there is evidence that some mammalian populations have
population sex-ratios that are more equal than would be expected under a binomial
distribution, this is not common. Is there more evidence than one study from the 1980s that
provides evidence for this?
Actually, we currently have a manuscript under consideration at Behavioral Ecology and
Sociobiology that looks at sex ratios and pregnancy age, among other things. We have
evidence that shows a decline of sex ratios as pregnancy progresses, suggesting that male
fetuses are aborted or resorbed.
Line 219: What causes even-sex litters to have higher cortisol relative to skewed-sex ratio
litters?
This is a key, important question. However, we cannot answer it at this point without
speculations.
As the animals were killed before the birth of offspring it is unclear whether the sex-ratio
predicts offspring survival. This requires discussion and is a major limitation of the study.
We now address it in the Discussion in lines 257-261.

We would like to thank the reviewers for their in-depth and constructive comments,
which have greatly improved our manuscript. Below please find our point-by point

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
In general, the authors have been responsive to my suggestions. I have only a
minor comment remaining.
Under-dispersion occurs with some data (l. 144) and this should be taken into
account. A few models exist that allow for both over- and under-dispersion. An
example is the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson model (see Lynch et al. 2014 in
Ecology: Dealing with under- and over-dispersed count data in life history,
spatial, and community ecology).
Thank you for this constructive comment. We have now included dispersion in
the Poisson model. This has strengthened our results (line 145-147 and line 169-
171 in the results).
Reviewer: 4
Comments to the Author(s)
After careful consideration I believe this paper provides some interesting data
regarding gestational cortisol and fetal sex-ratio in nutria, but due to a lack of
clarity regarding the interpretation and discussion of findings, methods and
statistics, I cannot recommend the manuscript for publication.
While the authors have made an effort to rectify a few of the statistical issues,
some areas in the methods remain unclear. Furthermore, the simple set of
results are convoluted making the interpretation of those results difficult. Overall
the article confuses ultimate and proximate mechanisms throughout and does
not explain the scientific background clearly.
We present a surprising parabolic link between cortisol and sex ratios. Based on
the literature, we bring suggestions of the link being either a mechanism
(proximate factor) serving ultimate causes (i.e. cortisol selected as a mechanism
to even sex rations), or alternatively being a developmental constraint on ultimate
causes, causing additional price on sex ratio biases. As we clearly state in our
manuscript we cannot support one or the other. We see your point and have
rephrased several parts of the manuscript, specifically in the Introduction and
Discussion (lines 34-42, 266-269).
There are no figures showing many findings, for example pregnancy stage and
fetal cortisol, which is an interesting finding.
We appreciate the reviewer's recognition of our many interesting findings.
However, the take-home message and novel finding of this manuscript is a never
reported parabolic link between cortisol and sex ratios, on which we focus. Other
interesting findings such as the link of pregnancy stage and fetal cortisol have
been documented in various systems. We report these results and acknowledge
their validity and importance as they allow future comparisons between species
and provide support to known links in nature. Accordingly, and following this
comment we further elaborate on these results and their relation to the literature
(line 44-46). Since our novel results are complicated, linking proximate and
ultimate mechanisms, and are challenging to explain, we only present them in a
figure, so that it remains the focus of our manuscript.
Methods
Line 126: What test used? Significance?
We had used Shapiro-Wilk W test, W=0.98 and the significance was P=0.152.
We now added this in line 128.
Were GLMMs used? How were models validated? What happens if non-
significant terms are removed?
We removed all non-significant variables except for litter size. Litter size was
retained following justified previous reviewer comments in order to correct for the
possible link between litter size and sex ratio. Adding or excluding the non-
significant terms has no effect on the results.
Results
Just use mean cortisol per litter or individual. It doesn’t add anything. Could add
in the methods the results are consistent using both methods.
We respectfully disagree. We present these two statistical approaches, which are
somewhat redundant but, in our opinion, not only strengthen our results but also
enable the readers to see the rationale that in even sex litters fetuses are more
likely have higher cortisol levels.
A great deal of the results section would be clearer in the methods section. It is
unnecessary in the results section.
Thank you for pointing this out. We fully agree and have moved the referenced
section accordingly (lines 113-114).
Line 154: How was this tested, statistical result?
Thank you for pointing this out. This lack of clarity may relate to your previous
comment. Yes, this was statistically tested and is now clarified in the text (line
153).
Line 176: Was maternal CORT measured in hair samples as well? It is an
interesting finding that they are not related, are fetuses producing their own
cortisol at this point in development?
Maternal cortisol was also measured in hair, as noted in the Methods in line 129-
131.
There is plenty of evidence for the independence of fetal cortisol production from
that of the mother. Even at earlier stages of pregnancy (for example see Murphy
et al. American journal of obstetrics and gynecology 118.4 (1974): 538-541).
Line 162 and 177: It looks like maternal ID has not been included here, due to
the resid DoF? But random effects are outlined below? Is maternal ID reflecting
maternal size, would be more interesting to include this in model?
We thank the reviewer for this comment. It obviously wasn’t clear that for these
analyses we used
the full sample size of fetuses, including those without hair and cortisol levels.
Trunk length could be measured in fetuses from estimated pregnancy stage of
105 days, Lines 81-85. We note again that in all analysis maternal ID was
included as a random factor.
Data availability
Can’t see data using dryad link, and not files attached.
We updated the link to Dryad. Our files should be showing now.
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
I have only minor comments:
L139: What do the residuals here refer to? As reviewer 2 has pointed out, it is not
a good idea to use residuals in subsequent analyses. Yet, Tables 1, 2 have litter
size in it, so no residuals are used here. Please clarify.
Unlike the analysis in Tables 1 and 2, here we simply wanted to eliminate the
effect of litter size when examining the link between fetuses neighbouring an
opposite-sex fetus and average cortisol. Statistically, it is similar to including litter
size in the model. However, this is a classic case of using residuals.
L143: Add that this is the ratio of deviance to df.
Thanks! We have now added this information (line 146).
L202-204: “Perhaps in mammals, cortisol is involved in maintaining even-sex
ratios through stabilizing selection, where its ‘protective’ effect enhances
development in mixed-sex litters, though at this stage, we cannot disentangle
cause and effect.”
I think still more work is needed from the authors on this paragraph, and more
than just a single sentence. So far, only the ‘cause’ part has been addressed in
that sentence, whereas the ‘effect’ part has been left up to the reader. It would be
good to make explicit here that more even litter sex ratios and well-mixed
intrauterine positions result in a different balance of male and female specific
hormones than when there is an extreme litter sex ratio. The former hormone
balance may well be more beneficial to development than the latter, particularly
as even litter sex ratios are likely to be more commonly experienced, so that
natural selection has a greater efficacy in such a condition. Consequently, more
‘optimal’ patterns of cortisol expression are more likely to be found the context of
even litter sex ratios.
Thanks! Although we tried to be careful about over speculations, we have
accepted the reviewer’s suggestion and have added this (lines 206-210).
In addition, authors seem to almost exclusively associate high cortisol levels with
stress. However, this depends on the duration of stress. Chronic exposure to
stress (perhaps due to a persistent exposure to a suboptimal balance of male vs
female hormones) actually can result in very low cortisol levels, as receptors get
desensitized. It would be good to state that the relation between cortisol level and
stress is not unidirectional and that hypocortisol expression is pathological too:
Fries et al. (2005). Psychoneuroendocrinology 30: 1010 - 1016
On the contrary. Throughout the manuscript we relate cortisol to development
rather than stress (e.g., lines 43-46, 192-194). In addition, we now also include
the reviewer’s comment concerning hypocortisol (lines 202-203).

Comments to the Author(s)
Thank you for your detailed responses to the Referees' comments. The result is
more compelling now, and certainly very intriguing! I am very happy with the
revisions made which have addressed my concerns.
Thanks!!!
