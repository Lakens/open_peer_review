26 Abstract
27
28
29 In this paper, the modified microbars prepared by dolomitic aggregates with
30
31 three kinds of particle size and self-made cement without K+, Na+ were cured in 1 and
32 2 N tetramethy1 ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) solution at 20, 60 and 80 °C,
33 respectively. TMAH was utilized as curing solution to exclude the expansion
34
35 contribution of alkali-silica reaction (ASR). Effects of the concentration of TMAH
36 solution, curing temperature and aggregate grain size on the expansion of dolomitic
37 aggregates were systematically investigated to determine the expansion characteristics
38
only caused by alkali-dolomite reaction (ADR). Expansion of modified microbars
39
40 cured in TMAH solution were measured. The porosities of original and reacted
41 aggregates were also measured. Microstructural studies were carried out by scanning
42 electron microscopy (SEM) and thermo-gravimetric (TG) analysis. The results
43
44 showed that the aggregate grain size and curing temperature can influence the
45 expansion of modified microbars significantly. When the modified microbars
46 prepared by aggregates with 2.5-5 mm grain size and cured in 1 N TMAH solution at
47
48 80 °C, the samples exhibited obvious expansion only caused by ADR, which is
49 beneficial to detect the ADR reactivity of dolomitic rocks exclusively in concrete
50 engineering. Based on the pore structure analysis, there was a slight increase (13%) in
51
porosities of aggregates cured for 140 d at 80 °C. Rod-like brucite crystals formed in
52
53 the process of ADR were also found in TG analysis and SEM images.

56 Introduction
57
58
59 Alkali-carbonate reaction (ACR) also called Alkali-dolomite reaction (ADR) is
60 one of important kinds of alkali-aggregate reaction, which means the alkali in the
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos

3
concrete reacts with dolomite crystals, leading to map-like cracks in the concrete and
4
5 deterioration of concrete. Since the detrimental ACR was found by Gillott [1] in the
6 1963s, extensive research has been carried out regarding the mechanism of the
7 reaction [2-5]. However, the concrete mechanism is still controversial and mainly can
8
9 be divided into two kinds: one is the growth of brucite crystal causing the expansion
10 [6], the other is the ACR just like to Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) [7-9]. Compared to
11 ASR, the ADR appears the following different characteristics: the reaction products
12
13
are not easy to find due to low amount; the reaction can take place in a low alkali
14 environment; ASR suppression measures are not suitable for ADR. Currently,
15 although the disagreement still exists, it is widely accepted worldwide that the
16
dolomite in dolomitic limestones interacts with the alkali hydroxides from the
17
18 concrete pore solution causing a fine intergrowth of calcite and brucite in the alkaline
19 condition. CO32- released in the process can migrates to the cement paste dissolving
20 the portlandite phase and releasing Ca2+ ions that can react to form secondary calcite
21
22 and carbonate halo around the aggregate. The solution alkalinity increases due to the
23 regeneration of the alkali hydroxide and the reaction will continue until the dolomite
24 is used up.
25
26
Deterioration of concrete in some airports and bridges can be ascribed to the
27 existence of high-alkali cement and aggregates with alkali-reactivity in concrete [10].
28 Although many corresponding methods for detection of potential alkali-reactivity of
29
aggregates have been formulated, misjudgment of alkali-activity of aggregates also
30
31 occurs in concrete engineering. Therefore, accurate identification of ADR activity in
32 carbonate aggregates is currently the only effective measure to prevent ADR damage.
33 The current methods for ADR identification mainly include petrographic method,
34
35 rock-prism method, concrete microbar and concrete prism method [11-14]. However,
36 these methods cannot distinguish whether the expansion originates from ADR or ASR
37 or both. Tina Princic [15] observed the process of dedolomitization of carbonate
38
39
aggregate rocks and mortar bars and found the process of ADR occurred not only in
40 the NaOH solution but also in the water on the mortar bar with virgin dolomitic
41 aggregate. P.stukovnik [16] indicated that a considerably higher increase in
42
compressive strength was detected over time for the mortar with dolomite aggregate,
43
44 compared to the one with limestone aggregate by investigating the process of ACR.
45 But most research is based on NaOH as curing solution, which cannot rule out the
46 expansion originates from ASR.
47
48 Chen [17] reported the microcrystalline quartz in dolomitic rocks can hardly
49 react with tetramethy1 ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) solution, which can exclude
50 the expansion contribution of ASR. But dolomite in dolomitic rocks can react with
51
52
TMAH solution and lead to expansion. Therefore, utilization of TMAH as curing
53 solution can be a specialized and effective way to detect the ADR reactivity of
54 dolomitic rocks. It is necessary to investigate the expansion characteristics and
55
microstructure of dolomitic aggregates before formulating the corresponding
56
57 standards for judging the ADR reactivity of dolomitic aggregates.
58 In order to provide a basis for concrete engineering applications in detecting the
59 ADR reactivity of dolomitic aggregates, the modified microbars has been prepared by

The cement clinker was prepared by calcining analytic reagent (Xilong Science
20
21 Co., Ltd.), followed by ground into powders with less than 10% sieve residue. The
22 analytic reagents were directly heated to 1450 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C /min,
23 with a dwelling time of 1 hour at 1450 °C. Table 1 shows the raw materials
24
25 composition of cement clinker without alkali. The reason for the cement without
26 alkali used in the study is ruling out the expansion originates from ASR. Figure 1
27 shows XRD pattern of cement clinker without K+ and Na+. To further characterize the
28
29
cement clinker, rietveld analysis was utilized to investigate the mineral contents of
30 cement clinker without K+ and Na+, as shown in Table 2. Gypsum and clinker
31 powders at a weight of 1/19 were blended for 12 h to get homogenous complete
32
cement without K+, Na+. Dolomitic rocks from Shandong province were used in the
33
34 study. Figure 2 shows XRD pattern of BFL-1 and BFL-9 rocks. It can be seen that the
35 two rocks were mainly composed of dolomite, calcite and a little amount of quartz.
36 Table 3 shows chemical composition of the dolomitic rocks used in the study. The
37
38 content of dolomite in BFL-9 was higher than that in BFL-1. Based on the content of
39 dolomite in the aggregates, they can be divided into dolomitic limestone (BFL-1) and
40 dolostone (BFL-9). According to RILEM AAR-5 [13], samples prepared by BFL-1,
41
42
BFL-9 aggregates had expansion value of 0.136% and 0.237% at 28 days of curing
43 age, respectively, which exhibited the ACR reactivity.

Preparation of modified microbars
51
52 BFL-1 and BFL-9 aggregates with different particle size (0-1.25, 1.25-2.5, 2.5-5
53
54 mm) and cement without K+, Na+ were employed to prepare specimens (2×2×8 cm) as
55 the preliminary microbars. The weight ratio of aggregates to cement was fixed to 3/2.
56 For each microbar formulation, aggregates and cement were mixed in a mixer (Type
57
58 NJ-160A, Shanghai Luheng Co. Ltd, China.). Samples completely made by cement
59 were used as the reference specimens. All specimens with the mould were placed in a
60 moist environment (RH=98%) at 20 °C. After 24 h the specimens were taken from the

mould and modified by cutting machine to obtain the modified microbars with 8 cm
4
5 length, 2 cm width and 5 mm thickness. Then the initial length measurement was
6 taken and the bars were transferred to containers filled with tetramethy1 ammonium
7 hydroxide solutions (Zhenjiang Runjing Co. Ltd, China.). There are two reasons for
8
9 the modification. One is to reduce the self-shrinkage of the cement, and the other is to
10 accelerate the alkali-dolomite reaction by directly contacting the aggregate with the
11 alkali solution and then contribute to more obvious expansion. Curing condition for
12
13
the specimens made by the aggregates with ACR activity were: t =20, 60 and 80 °C,
14 and c=1, 2 N (concentration of TMAH).
15
16
17 Testing and characterization
18
19
20
X-ray diffraction (Smart Lab, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) analysis was used for the
21 composition of self-made cement without K+, Na+ and the mineralogical detection of
22 dolomitic rocks. The length changes of all the specimens prepared by BFL-1 and
23
BFL-9 aggregates were measured at different intervals and the expansions of
24
25 modified microbars were calculated by JC/T 313-2009 (Chinese Standard). Each
26 length change value used was the mean value of five replicate specimens. The
27 porosities and pore size distribution of original and reacted aggregates were tested by
28
29 mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). Corresponding thermo-gravimetric analysis
30 was carried out by thermal gravimetric analyzer (SDT Q600) at temperature ranging
31 from 20 to 950 °C with N2 ambience. The morphologies of BFL-9 grains enriched
32
33
dolomite selected from the modified microbars cured for 140 days were also observed
34 by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, JEM-6510) coupled with energy
35 dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis.

38 Results and Discussion
39
40
41
42 Effect of aggregate grain size on the expansion of modified microbars cured in
43
44 TMAH solution
45
46
47 Changes in particle size of aggregate not only influence the microbar structure
48 but also the ion migration during the process of alkali-dolomite reaction [18]. To
49
investigate effect of particle size of aggregate on the expansion of modified microbars,
50
51 aggregates with 0-1.25, 1.25-2.5, 2.5-5 mm particle size were used to prepare
52 microbars cured at 80 °C in 1 N TMAH solution. Figure 3 shows the expansion of
53 microbars prepared by BFL-1 and BFL-9 rocks. From Figure 3(a), the expansion
54
55 process of microbars can be divided into three stages. For the first stage, the
56 microbars prepared by aggregates with different particle size appear slow expansion.
57 The expansion of bars at 14 d was just 0.007%. Compared to microbars made by 2.5-5
58
59
mm aggregates, bars made by finer aggregates and paste had shrinkage at early curing
60 ages. The shrinkage of paste was 0.013%. For the second stage, bars had obvious

3
expansion as curing ages increase and the differences in expansion began to expand.
4
5 But the paste still had obvious shrinkage. For the last stage, in addition to the paste,
6 the expansion of bars appear slow again and tend to stable. At 140 d, the shrinkage of
7 paste was 0.053%, but the expansion of bars was up to 0.167%. From Figure 3(b), the
8
9 expansion process of bars was similar to that in Figure 3(a). Compare to BFL-1, the
10 samples made by BFL-9 had bigger expansion. The maximum expansion of BFL-9
11 bars was 0.186%.
12
13
At early curing ages, samples with slow expansion can be ascribed to the obvious
14 shrinkage of cement without alkali and the shrinkage offset some expansion
15 originated from ADR. Cement shrinkage can be ascribed to the formation of
16
hydration products with lower volume during the early ages. The whole expansion of
17
18 microbars was not quite big due to TMAH solution ruling out the expansion came
19 from ASR. From Table 3, it can be seen that the content of dolomite in BFL-9 was
20 higher than that in BFL-1, which may account for bigger expansion. As shown in
21
22 Figure 3, the differences in the expansion of bars made by different particle size were
23 obvious. The differences can be explained by that when the aggregate size and cement
24 particle size are similar, the expansion of the bars is more susceptible to the shrinkage
25
26
of the cement. From the results in Figure 3, it was indicated that particle size of the
27 aggregates can influence the expansion of microbars significantly. Compared with
28 0-1.25, 1.25-2.5 mm, microbars prepared by 2.5-5 mm aggregates had bigger
29
expansion and 2.5-5 mm was more suitable as the particle size.

and 80 °C. For BFL-1 bars, the differences in expansion between bars cured at
4
5 different temperature were small. But the differences became obvious after 14 days.
6 When the curing age was 140 d, the expansions of bars cured at 20, 60 and 80 °C
7 were 0.025%, 0.115% and 0.167%, respectively and tend to stable. When the curing
8
9 temperature increased from 60°C to 80°C, the expansion of bars cured at 80 °C was
10 45% larger than that cured at 60 °C. From Figure 4 (b), compared to BFL-1 rocks, the
11 differences in the expansion of BFL-9 were more obvious at early cuing age. The
12
13
whole expansion process was similar to that of BFL-1 and the bars had slow
14 expansion after 112 d. The expansions of bars cured at 20, 60 and 80 °C were 0.043%,
15 0.125% and 0.186% at 140 d curing age. For BFL-9 aggregates, the expansion of
16
microbar cured at 80 °C was 49% larger than that of microbar cured at 60 °C. When
17
18 the curing temperature increased, the expansion of microbars became larger.
19 Differences in the expansion of microbars cured at different temperature can be
20 ascribed to the reaction rate of ADR. Increasing the curing temperature improved the
21
22 rate of alkaline ion migration into the interior of dolomite and accelerated the ADR,
23 thus promoting the expansion of modified microbars. Therefore, selecting 80 °C as
24 the curing temperature can shorten the time for experiment.

52 To further investigate the influence of the concentration of curing solution on the

54 aggregates with 2.5-5 mm particle size at 80 °C were cured in 1 and 2 mol/L TMAH

solutions, respectively. The results were given in Figure 5. From Figure 5(a), samples
57 made by BFL-1 aggregates had small expansion at early curing age. After 14 days, the
58 corresponding expansion became obvious. There was a shape increase in 56 d curing
59
age. But the expansion of samples became stable after 112 days. It can be seen that
60

3
the differences in expansion between samples cured in 1 and 2 mol/L were slight.
4
5 Compared to cured in 1 mol/L TMAH solution, samples cured in 2 mol/L had slight
6 lower expansion before 70 d, but higher expansion appeared after 70 d. The expansion
7 of BFL-1 samples cured in 1 and 2 mol/L TMAH solutions were 0.167% and 0.183%
8
9 at 140 d. As shown in Figure 5(b), the expansion process of samples made by BFL-9
10 aggregates was just like to BFL-1 aggregates, except bigger expansion. The expansion
11 of BFL-9 samples cured in 1 and 2 mol/L TMAH solutions were 0.186% and 0.194%
12
13
at 140 d. No obvious differences between samples cured in 1 and 2 mol/L can be
14 ascribed to the sufficient alkaline in these two concentrations of alkali solutions. 1
15 mol/L TMAH solution may provide enough alkaline in the process of alkali-dolomite
16
reaction. But at later curing age, the alkaline maybe not enough for the
17
18 alkali-consuming ADR, which may accounts for samples cured in 2 mol/L TMAH
19 solution with higher expansion than that cured in 1 mol/L TMAH solution. By taking
20 expansion characteristics as well as economy into consideration, the particle size,
21
22 curing temperature and concentration of TMAH solution were fixed at 2.5-5 mm, 80
23 °C and 1 mol/L, respectively, to investigate the microstructure of dolomitic
24 aggregates cured in TMAH solution.

In order to investigate effect of alkali-dolomite reaction on the pore structures of
50
51 dolomitic rocks, Figure 6 shows the pore size distribution of BFL-9 original aggregate
52 grains and reacted aggregate grains cured in TMAH solution for 140 days. It can be
53 seen that the pores in original aggregates with a pore diameter range of 0.2-1.1 µm,
54
55 but the pores in reacted aggregates with a pore diameter range of 0.1-1.2 µm.
56 Compared to the original aggregate grain in pore size distribution, the reacted
57 aggregate grain had new-formed micro-pores with pore diameter ranging from 0.1-0.2
58
59
µm. As shown in Figure 6(b), the total porosities of original and reacted aggregates
60 were 0.143% and 0.162%, respectively. Compared to the original aggregates in

porosity, the reacted aggregates exhibited a slight increase (13%) in total porosities at
4
5 140 d, which was similar to the results from P.stukovnik [16]. This may be due to that
6 the growth of brucite crystal as result of alkali-dolomite reaction in the restricted
7 space dilated the pores.

27 To characterize the reaction products of alkali-dolomite reaction, Figure 7 shows
28 DSC-TG analysis on BFL-9 dolomitic grain cured in TMAH solution for 140 days. It
29 can be seen that there was a slight peak at 380 °C, which represented the existence of
30
31 brucite in reacted dolomitic aggregates. The slight peak is ascribed to the small
32 amount of brucite. According to Tong [2], brucite crystals grow up in confined spaces,
33 bringing about the expansion of dolomitic aggregates, which may accounts for the
34
35
changes in total porosities. To further characterize brucite formed in the process of
36 ADR, SEM-EDS analysis of dolomitic aggregate grains was carried out.

From Katayama [9], the alkali-dolomite reaction can occur within the reaction
4
5 rims and along pre-existing cracks, and the characteristic myrmekitic texture can be
6 visible. But to further investigate the reaction products of ADR, as shown in Figure 8,
7 the reacted BFL-9 aggregate with dolomite enrichment area and cracks was selected
8
9 to be observed by SEM-EDS analysis. From Figure 8(a), it can be seen that many
10 rod-like crystals beside the micro-crack. Figure 8(b) shows EDS spectra determined in
11 zone 1. Combining the two figures, it is indicated that rod-like brucite crystals formed
12
13
in the process of ADR indeed exist. The distribution of brucite crystals can be
14 explained by that the alkali-dolomite reaction can not only occur at the interface
15 between the dolomite and the cement paste but also inside the dolomite. When the pH
16
and temperature of the curing solution is high enough, the ADR can continue to occur.
17
18 Due to TMAH solution utilized in this work to rule out the influence from
19 microcrystalline quartz and exclude the expansion contribution of ASR, the expansion
20 only origins from the alkali-dolomite reaction. So the expansion of the modified
21
22 microbars cured in TMAH solutions can be ascribed to the existence and growth of
23 brucite crystals in limited space although the dedolomitization with a process of
24 volume reduction. Based on the aforementioned discussion, it can be indicated that
25
26
the alkali-dolomite reaction can occur in some special dolomitic aggregates cured in 1
27 mol/L TMAH solution at 80 °C and brings about expansion.

51 Conclusions
52
53
54
In this work, the modified microbars prepared by dolomitic aggregates and
55 self-made cement were used to systematically investigate effects of the concentration
56 of TMAH solution, curing temperature and aggregate grain size on the expansion of
57
dolomitic aggregates. From the physical measurement and microstructural analysis,
58
59 the following major conclusions can be drawn:
60 Changing the aggregate grain size for modified microbars and increasing the
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos

3
curing temperature can considerably increase the rate of alkali-dolomite reaction and
4
5 then accelerate the samples with bigger expansion. Compared with 0-1.25, 1.25-2.5
6 mm particle size, modified microbars prepared by 2.5-5 mm grains have bigger
7 expansion. The expansion of microbars cured at 80 °C is 49% larger than that cured at
8
9 60 °C for 140 days, much larger than that cured at 20 °C. The expansion of microbars
10 cured in 1 and 2 mol/L TMAH solution have no obvious differences ,which probably
11 due to adequate alkaline for ADR.
12
13
Based on the analysis on pore size distribution and total porosities of aggregate
14 grains, the porosity increased 13% as result of ADR. According to the TG analysis
15 assisted SEM-EDS analysis, it was revealed that rod-like brucite crystals formed in
16
the process of ADR were found.
17
18 Due to TMAH solution utilized in this work to rule out the influence from
19 microcrystalline quartz and exclude the expansion contribution of ASR, the expansion
20 only origins from the alkali-dolomite reaction. The alkali-dolomite reaction can occur
21
22 in some special dolomitic aggregates cured in 1 mol/L TMAH solution at 80 °C and
23 brings about expansion.

Appendix B
Responses to reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer #1:
Reviewer’s comments: This is an interesting work that discusses TMAH
solution was utilized as curing solution to investigate the expansion
characteristics only caused by ADR. However, several aspects of the
work must be improved before it can be accepted for publication. I
have listed them in detail below:
1. Details of TMAH solution are not presented. What are the
similarities and differences between TMAH solution and NaOH
solutions? such as PH? chemical formula?
Response: Thank you very much for your valuable comments and
suggestions. The chemical formula of TMAH is (CH3)4NOH with
91.15 relative molecular mass. It is very easy to absorb moisture and
has a weak ammonia smell. TMAH solution is a colorless and
transparent liquid with an ammonia smell as well. The degree of
alkalinity is similar to that of NaOH. Compared to NaOH solution,
TMAH solution belongs to organic alkali rather than common
inorganic alkali. In addition, NaOH reacts with SiO2 but TMAH does
not react with SiO2. The details of TMAH solution have been added in
the manuscript (please see p. 3 lines 23-27).
2. Most research about AAR(alkali-aggregate reaction) is based on
NaOH solution, which cannot rule out the expansion originates from
ASR or ACR. But TMAH can exclude the expansion contribution of
ASR. What is the effect mechanism? What are the differences between
TMAH and NaOH resulted in the different expansion?
Response: Thank you for your question. TMAH was used to exclude
the expansion contribution of ASR due to TMAH does not react with
SiO2. According to J.T.L. Thong [1], TMAH has been widely utilized in
silicon anisotropic etching due to reliable etching of silicon in the
fabrication of microelectrornechanical systems. The reaction equation
is shown in equation as follow:
Si+TMAH+H2O<U+2192>TMA2SiO3+SiO2+H2
From the reaction chemical formula, it can be seen that TMAH is used
as reactant and SiO2 is the corresponding product. It can be conclude
that TMAH does not react with SiO2 because reactants and products
do not react. The differences between TMAH and NaOH resulted in
expansion can be conclude two points. One is that the expansions of
samples cured in TMAH solution are less than the expansions of the
same samples cured in the NaOH solution due to excluding the
expansion contribution of ASR. The other is that the expansions of
samples cured in TMAH solution develop slower than that cured in
NaOH at early age. The reasons for this phenomenon and research on
the correlation between the expansion and the content of brucite are
the key points in our future work. The effect mechanism and the
differences in expansion have been added in this manuscript (please
see p. 2 lines 38-42, p. 6 lines 25-28).

parameters, Sensors and Actuators A 63 (1997) 243-249.
3. Table 1 the composition of cement clinker, CaCO3 should be
changed to CaO.
Response: Thank you for your comments. In fact, Table 1 shows the
raw materials composition of cement clinker rather than the chemical
composition of cement clinker. Analytic CaCO3, SiO2, Al2O3 and
Fe3O4 were used as raw material to prepare cement clinker without K+
and Na+ in this work.
4. Page10Line31, which represented the existence of brucite in reacted
dolomitic aggregates. Can you quantify the amounts of the brucite?
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. According to your
advice, we have quantified the amounts of the brucite by TG-DSC
analysis. Fig. 7 shows the typical TG-DSC curves of the dolomitic
aggregate grain cured in TMAH solution. There is a endothermic peak
appearing at the DSC curves, namely from 350 °C to 400 °C, which is
corresponding to the dehydration of Mg(OH)2. Therefore, the contents
of Mg(OH)2 contained in the aggregate grain could be estimated
according to the following equation:
where, the refers to the contents of Mg(OH)2 formed in
the process of alkali-carbonate reaction, and 58 and 18 represent the
relative molecular mass of Mg(OH)2 and H2O, respectively. On the
basis of the abovementioned equation, the amounts of the brucite
contained in BFL-9 dolomitic grain were 0.61%. The details of
quantifying the amounts of the brucit have been added in the
manuscript (please see p. 9 lines 20-27, p. 10 line 1).
Reviewer #2:
Reviewer’s comments:
1. “This name is no common. Please indicate reference. I don´t think
so. Alkali silica reaction is the most common.” (Alkali-carbonate
reaction (ACR) also called Alkali-dolomite reaction (ADR) is one of
important kinds of alkali-aggregate reaction.)
Response: Thank you very much for your valuable comments and
suggestions. Alkali-dolomite reaction is no common in many
references. “ACR is one of important kinds of alkali-aggregate
reaction” is not suitable. We have revised our statement and ADR has
been changed to ACR. The revised statement about ACR have been
added in the manuscript (please see p. 1 line 29).
2. “Myrmekite describes a vermicular, or wormy, intergrowth of
quartz in plagioclase. I don´t understand which is the characteristic
myrmekitic texture in a dolstone?” (From Katayama, the
alkali-dolomite reaction can occur within the reaction rims and along
pre-existing cracks, and the characteristic myrmekitic texture can be
visible.)
Response: We failed to accurately express the views of Katayama.
From Katayama,[1, 2]
according to polarizing microscopy, it was
observed that dedolomitization produced a myrmekitic texture,
composed of spotted brucite and calcite within the reaction rim, along
with a carbonate halo of calcite in the surrounding cement paste. In
addition, according to Štukovnik [3], myrmekitic texture can be seen as
follow:
The characteristic myrmekitic texture is not the key point in this work.
We have revised our statement in this manuscript (please see p. 10
lines 8-10).

3. “Brucite crystalization is a consequence of the dedolomitizacion
process. If you have brucite would be associated with calcite and not
with dolomite.”(The distribution of brucite crystals can be explained
by that the alkali-dolomite reaction can not only occur at the interface
between the dolomite and the cement paste but also inside the
dolomite.)
Response: Thanks for your comments. According to SEM-EDS
analysis, brucite can be seen in Figure 8(a). Brucite is the reaction
product result from alkali-carbonate reaction. Dolomite reacts with
alkali forming brucite and calcite, so they are coexisting. But in the
process of dedolomitization, unreacted dolomite still exists in the
aggregate grain because some dolomite have not yet fully reacted. We
have revised this sentence (please see p. 10 lines 16-19).
4. “Clarify the sentence” (So the expansion of the modified microbars
cured in TMAH solutions can be ascribed to the existence and growth
of brucite crystals in limited space although the dedolomitization with
a process of volume reduction.)
Response: Sorry for our inaccurate statement. In fact, the process of
alkali-carbonate reaction can be conclude by the following two
equations:
CaMg(CO3)2 + 2OH- = Mg(OH)2 + CaCO3 + CO32- (1)
CO32- + Ca(OH)2 = CaCO3 + 2OH- (2)
Firstly, dolomite contained in carbonate rock reacts with the alkali
released from cement or admixture. Formula (1) is a reaction in which
the solid phase volume is reduced, and the calculation shows that the
[1]
solid phase volume is reduced by 4.4% . Lastly, Ca(OH)2 formed in
the process of cement hydration reacts with CO32-, generating
secondary calcite and OH-. According to Katayama [2], the solid phase
volume of formula (2) is increased by 10.2%. Therefore, our statement
is inaccurate. According to Tong [3], brucite crystals grow up in
confined spaces, bringing about the expansion of dolomitic aggregates.
We have revised this sentence. Corresponding revision has been added
in this manuscript (please see p. 8 lines 22-24).
