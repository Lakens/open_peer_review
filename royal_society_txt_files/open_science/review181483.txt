The manuscript reports a very interesting approach, using Raman spectroscopy, for
characterizing fundamental structural properties of fatty acids. The paper, that in my opinion
gives novetly to the field, has been widely improved taking seriously into account all comments
of the previous Reviewers.
In the light of these considerations, I consider the manuscript suitable for publication in Royal
Society Open Science, in the present form.

This article, covers many aspects of Raman spectroscopy applied to the study and identification
of fatty acids and associated molecular bonds. Much of this is already known or published,
however, this article is comprehensive and well considered and likely to used as a reference
document for many to follow. I for one will pass it to my group and reference it.
The article provides a clear pathway for quantification of fatty acid length and saturation using
both univariate and bivariate approaches as well as multivariate approaches. I particularly value
the use of three laser wavelengths to demonstrate to the reader the effect of instrument response
function upon the peak ratios utilised.

Some minor improvements would strengthen this paper further:
1) Provide an overview of the spectral resolution of the spectrometer at each wavelength to
enable the reader to understand the effects of this on bond quantification.
2) Page 11 line 18 triolein is misspelt.
3) Why were different objectives used? Does it matter? If they have different background
contributions, does this affect the transfer of the calibration to prediction models?
4) How much fluorescence was seen, particularly in the natural oils? Could the background
subtraction processes have effected the resultant classification?
5) There are numerous references to the measurement of the high wavenumber region centred at
3000 cm-1, but then truncated to remove above 3200 cm-1. Ok fine to hear that in the methods, so
we understand the where the grating was centred, but why then say it every time when showing
high wavenumber data in figures, This is rather confusing, when these plots are actually centred
at around 2900 cm-1.
6) When discussing the use of multivariate analysis approaches, it is not entirely clear why only 2
latent variables were selected in the PLSR model for prediction. How was this decision reached?
This decision could significantly have affected the model in terms of under or over fitting and
therefore its performance relative to the ratiometric approaches.
You suggest on page 17 that the model was 'made too complex'. This may be true, but it may be
an indication that 3 LVs were needed to describe all aspects of bond structure.
7) The methods of bond quantification have lots of value in studying fatty acids, however, is
quantification necessary for classification of adulterated foodstuffs? I would have expected the
full fingerprint chemometric approaches to be most effective at this.
8) I cannot judge the accompanying data as I was unable to access it without a password in the
reviewers copy. It would be good to see the raw data here if it is available to enable the reader to
understand any negative effects on analysis of pre-processing steps.
9) Larger figures (such as Fig 3) would make the spectral features of interest between the fatty
acids studied to be more easily distinguished.

Comments to the Author(s)
This article, covers many aspects of Raman spectroscopy applied to the study and
identification of fatty acids and associated molecular bonds. Much of this is already
known or published, however, this article is comprehensive and well considered and
likely to used as a reference document for many to follow. I for one will pass it to my
group and reference it.
The article provides a clear pathway for quantification of fatty acid length and saturation
using both univariate and bivariate approaches as well as multivariate approaches. I
particularly value the use of three laser wavelengths to demonstrate to the reader the
effect of instrument response function upon the peak ratios utilised.
Some minor improvements would strengthen this paper further:
1) Provide an overview of the spectral resolution of the spectrometer at each wavelength
to enable the reader to understand the effects of this on bond quantification.
Spectral resolution of the spectrometer at each wavelength was determined from the
FWHM of the 520 cm-1 peak in a silicon reference sample and the results have been
added to the Material and Methods section under Instrumentation as follows:
“Instrumentation. Raman spectra were acquired on a Renishaw inVia Raman
microscope equipped with a 20×/NA 0.40 objective or a 50×/NA 0.75 objective and:
<U+F0B7> a 532 nm Nd:YAG laser and 1800 l/mm grating giving a maximum power of 500 mW and
a spectral resolution of ca. 4.1 cm-1 measured using the full width at half maximum
(FWHM) of the peak at 520 cm-1 in the spectrum of a silicon reference sample;
<U+F0B7> a 633 nm He-Ne laser and 1800 l/mm grating giving a maximum power of 500 mW and
a spectral resolution of ca. 3.5 cm-1 measured using the FWHM of the peak at 520 cm-1
in the spectrum of a silicon reference sample;
<U+F0B7> a 785 nm diode laser and 1200 l/mm grating giving a maximum power of 500 mW and
a spectral resolution of ca. 4.8 cm-1 measured using the FWHM of the peak at 520 cm-1
in the spectrum of a silicon reference sample.”
2) Page 11 line 18 triolein is misspelt.
This has been corrected.
3) Why were different objectives used? Does it matter? If they have different
background contributions, does this affect the transfer of the calibration to prediction
models?
There was no particular reason for using the different objectives. The following details
have been added to the Materials and Methods section:
“A different objective (50× instead of 20×) was used for food oil spectral acquisitions,
however, this should not affect the resultant analysis, as instrument calibrations were
always performed on a silicon standard prior to spectral acquisition to ensure consistent
spectral response, and appropriate background corrections were performed on all
spectra. The only noticeable difference observed in spectra between the two objectives
was a higher overall spectral intensity when using the 50× objective due to a shorter
working distance.”
4) How much fluorescence was seen, particularly in the natural oils? Could the
background subtraction processes have effected the resultant classification?
Some discussion of observed fluorescence was added to the results section on
‘Comparison of ratiometric and multivariate analysis on food oil samples’, as follows:
“It is worth noting here that, particularly with the food oil samples, and to a varying
extent in the lipid standard samples, background fluorescence was observed. Where this
was particularly high, it was reduced by exposing the sample to the laser over a period
of time in order to bleach some of the background fluorescence. For the vegetable oil
sample, the acquisition time also had to be reduced, however it is not believed that
differing background fluorescence contributions affected results, as background
subtraction was performed for each spectrum to remove this and any other background
contributions while avoiding over-subtraction.”
5) There are numerous references to the measurement of the high wavenumber region
centred at 3000 cm-1, but then truncated to remove above 3200 cm-1. Ok fine to hear
that in the methods, so we understand the where the grating was centred, but why then
say it every time when showing high wavenumber data in figures, This is rather
confusing, when these plots are actually centred at around 2900 cm-1.
These statements regarding spectral centre have been removed from the figures to
improve clarity, and instead the spectra are referred to as low wavenumber or high
wavenumber.
6) When discussing the use of multivariate analysis approaches, it is not entirely clear
why only 2 latent variables were selected in the PLSR model for prediction. How was this
decision reached? This decision could significantly have affected the model in terms of
under or over fitting and therefore its performance relative to the ratiometric
approaches.
You suggest on page 17 that the model was 'made too complex'. This may be true, but it
may be an indication that 3 LVs were needed to describe all aspects of bond structure.
Further details have been added to clarify this choice as follows:
“From Figure S6, either 1 or 2 PCs were selected as optimal in order to minimise MSPE
without overfitting. 2 PCs were ultimately selected after consideration of the PC plots in
Figure 5, where PC1 only discriminated unsaturated from saturated FAs, while PC2
clearly discriminated unsaturated FAs with different degrees of unsaturated.”
7) The methods of bond quantification have lots of value in studying fatty acids,
however, is quantification necessary for classification of adulterated foodstuffs? I would
have expected the full fingerprint chemometric approaches to be most effective at this.
This may be the case but we have added the following sentence to the conclusion to
highlight this application as an ideal application to test our model even if it may not be
the best approach for classification of adulterated foodstuffs:
“While there may be better approaches using Raman spectroscopy and chemometrics to
identify adulterated foodstuffs, this served as a topical and relevant application for
demonstration of the utility of this ratiometric approach, and provided an alternative
approach to this problem.”
8) I cannot judge the accompanying data as I was unable to access it without a
password in the reviewers copy. It would be good to see the raw data here if it is
available to enable the reader to understand any negative effects on analysis of pre-
processing steps.
Raw data will be available from a data repository as stated under the Data Accessibility
