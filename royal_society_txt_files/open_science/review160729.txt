The paper entitled “Symmetry, topology and the maximum…” by Pikhitsa and Pikhitsa is
concerned with the classification of mutually touching pairwise infinite cylinders in 3D Euclidean
space. As the paper stands I am sure it will be of interest to specialists in the very narrow field to
whom the paper is addressed to. However, the paper is currently almost completely inaccessible
to the general mathematical reader (in which I include scientists working in pure/applied
mathematics – and - areas such as physics, chemistry and theoretical biology – all of which are
areas in which this work could have an impact). Depending on the how widely the authors wish
for their work to be received they may choose to adopt some (or all) of the recommendations
below.
In the first case: It is not clear to me from the introduction if the problem that the authors are
concerned with is: if at least one cylinder touches one other cylinder – or – if they are looking for
configurations in which: each cylinder makes contact with every other cylinder. Some illustrative
figures (toy examples – with only three or four cylinder) of the type presented in figure 4 would
be useful here.
As a non-specialist I find the introduction far too terse. It would help the paper to be more
accessible if the authors could provide the reader with some intuitive examples (i.e. toy models)
with which to gain an initial understanding of the problem at hand.
Why are 7,8 and 9 mutually touching cylinders so interesting? (again I am not an expert – please
try to help readers like me)
What is meant by a cylinder with arbitrary cross section? If a cylinder has a circular cross section
– do the results in this paper extend to rods with an elliptical cross section? What about rods with
a square cross section? Or a rectangular one? If it is rectangular I can make one side much longer
than the other so that I have a 2D sheet – do your results still hold? If so – I don’t believe it! Please
convince me…!
“Seidel adjacency matrix used in the theory of graphs” – what is the Seidel adjacency matrix?
It’s very hard to follow what the meaning of (7), (8) and (9). Again if the introduction had
included a toy example with the corresponding matrices worked out alongside it would be of
use.
“Two cylinders are said to be in equal environment (EE) if two rows/columns that correspond to
these two cylinders in the chirality matrix are identical or can be made identical by multiplying
by -1.” – Why does multiplication by -1 achieve this? Can I have a picture showing the
symmetries of the chirality matrix with an actual example alongside?
Continuing further: I’m afraid I’m beginning to lose my grasp (which was already weak) on what
is going on. Although, the discussion on “cylinders of arbitrary cross-section” is useful.
The discussion at the start of the section entitled “Collection of configurations of 7,8, and 9
mutually touching round infinite cylinders.” Is VERY dense and hard to follow.
The above points are just a representative example of the difficulties I have in accessing this
paper. I’m sure I would not be alone in grasping the significance of this work. I hope the authors
will take steps to improve the readability of the paper for non-specialists. I cannot comment on
the validity of the findings since I am at present unable to fully comprehend the nature of the
problem - and the solution - posed by the authors.

The authors address a topic that is mathematically interesting and their results are, in addition,

1. The proofs of the Theorems on page 8: The authors are (presumably) using the result that any
n+1 - dimensional chirality matrix contains a (in fact n) n-dimensional chirality matrices. It would
be helpful to state this. The program in Appendix 5 which is used to prove this result is hard to

row field to whom the paper is addressed to. However, the paper is currently almost
pletely inaccessible to the general mathematical reader (in which I include scientists working

which are areas in which this work could have an impact). Depending on the how widely the
hors wish for their work to be received they may choose to adopt some (or all) of the
ommendations below.
would like to thank the Reviewer for the advice to improve the readability of the article
ch we have gladly followed.
he first case: It is not clear to me from the introduction if the problem that the authors are
cerned with is: if at least one cylinder touches one other cylinder – or – if they are looking for
figurations in which: each cylinder makes contact with every other cylinder. Some illustrative
res (toy examples – with only three or four cylinder) of the type presented in figure 4 would
useful here.
a non-specialist I find the introduction far too terse. It would help the paper to be more
essible if the authors could provide the reader with some intuitive examples (i.e. toy models)
h which to gain an initial understanding of the problem at hand.
he introduction we used the words “mutually touching” which assumes that each cylinder
kes contact with every other cylinder. We rewrote the introduction in the revised MS now
laining the simple geometry of the problem by describing the process of stepwise creating
figuration examples and by making reference to Fig.1b of our paper [2] in pssb 2009 where
configuration of the mutually touching 7 round equal cylinders was published for the first
e (Fig. R1).
. R1.
put into the revised MS a paragraph:
order to construct a configuration of mutually touching cylinders one may begin with two
nite round cylinders in a mutual touch at one point (like scissors) and then add the third one
hat it simultaneously touches both cylinders. Then one adds the fourth cylinder to touch
ultaneously each of the rest ones. Beginning from the fifth cylinder further adding the
nders grows harder. Thus the problem of how many infinite round cylinders in 3D it is
sible to put into the mutual touching arises.”
y are 7,8 and 9 mutually touching cylinders so interesting? (again I am not an expert – please
to help readers like me)
the maximum number of mutually touching equal round cylinders which we found in [2]. In
e of equal spheres this number is 4. These numbers are fundamental and reflect the basic
perties of packing in 3D space. But unlike spheres, cylinders are additionally characterized by
ntations (angular variables) which become entangled with the spatial variables through the
rdinates of the contact points of the cylinders [1]. The importance of such a problem lies in a
llenge for modern mathematics which has difficulties with solving entangled configurations.
example, the complexity of the knot theory is well known. Yet the entanglement of many
nders may look even more complicated because of the multicomponent nature of the problem.
ne allows the cylinders to have more freedom (the first step was to allow round cylinders to
e arbitrary radii) then (we showed that) the number of the mutually touching cylinders grows
maximum 9.
at is meant by a cylinder with arbitrary cross section? If a cylinder has a circular cross section
o the results in this paper extend to rods with an elliptical cross section? What about rods with
uare cross section? Or a rectangular one? If it is rectangular I can make one side much longer
n the other so that I have a 2D sheet – do your results still hold? If so – I don’t believe it!
ase convince me…!
we wrote on page 8 “Still it is possible to consider infinite straight stripes (blades) with straight line
es if only the pairwise contact is allowed which we will publish elsewhere.” Certainly our results
end to rods with an elliptical cross section and hold even for 2D flat infinite stripes/sheets
ng a degenerate case of the cylinders. The only important restriction for the general result of
cylinders of arbitrary cross-section to hold for infinitely thin stripes/blades is to forbid more
n two infinitely thin blades touching in one single point (multiple touching may be possible
to their degeneracy in thickness). We easily calculated a 7 stripe configuration of equal
pes as an example (see Fig. R2) and we plan to consider this special degenerate case in full
publish elsewhere.
. R2.
idel adjacency matrix used in the theory of graphs” – what is the Seidel adjacency matrix?
Seidel adjacency matrix is a special matrix from the Theory of Graphs. Its definition is: the
del adjacency matrix of a simple undirected graph is a symmetric matrix with a row and
umn for each vertex, having 0 on the diagonal, -1 for positions whose rows and columns
respond to adjacent vertices, and +1 for positions corresponding to non-adjacent vertices. We
uded this definition in the revised MS.
ccording to its definition, the Seidel adjacency matrix of a simple undirected graph is a
metric matrix with a row and column for each vertex, having 0 on the diagonal, -1 for
itions whose rows and columns correspond to adjacent vertices, and +1 for positions
responding to non-adjacent vertices. ”
very hard to follow what the meaning of (7), (8) and (9). Again if the introduction had
uded a toy example with the corresponding matrices worked out alongside it would be of use.
fortunately, it is not easy to simplify the situation without losing its natural complexity
ause any configuration that makes sense is multicomponent: even to make a ring that
ages/contains one cylinder already takes at least four cylinders. We do believe that following
recommendation given in the text the ring matrices (7), (8) and chirality matrix (9) can be
erstood after some efforts:
is remarkable that one can reproduce the chirality matrix and the ring matrix just by
pecting any given configuration while establishing directions along the cylinders and marking
chirality at each contact, along with the counting the number of rings around each cylinder
contain this cylinder.”
wo cylinders are said to be in equal environment (EE) if two rows/columns that correspond to
se two cylinders in the chirality matrix are identical or can be made identical by multiplying
-1.” – Why does multiplication by -1 achieve this? Can I have a picture showing the
metries of the chirality matrix with an actual example alongside?
answer is simple: multiplying the row/column by -1 just changes the orientation of the
responding cylinder to the opposite direction which is not relevant for the EE configuration
ause the cylinder is symmetric and should be characterized rather by a director then by a
tor. We added in the revised MS:
the direction of a line is switched to the opposite one then the corresponding matrix entries
multiplied by -1 and the chirality matrix becomes different. On the other hand, any numerical
ariant based on the chirality matrix should not depend on switching line direction to opposite
cause cylinders are symmetric) and thus one has to construct a matrix that is degenerate
ards opposite line directions.”
ntinuing further: I’m afraid I’m beginning to lose my grasp (which was already weak) on what
oing on. Although, the discussion on “cylinders of arbitrary cross-section” is useful.
discussion at the start of the section entitled “Collection of configurations of 7,8, and 9
tually touching round infinite cylinders.” Is VERY dense and hard to follow.
should confess that it is true and the section should be difficult to follow. Yet the section has
y an illustrative character and being considered superficially is just a list of configurations but
ay be useful for a deeply interested reader.
above points are just a representative example of the difficulties I have in accessing this
er. I’m sure I would not be alone in grasping the significance of this work. I hope the authors
l take steps to improve the readability of the paper for non-specialists. I cannot comment on

thank Reviewer 2 for his favorable attitude and valuable comments.
he proofs of the Theorems on page 8: The authors are (presumably) using the result that any
- dimensional chirality matrix contains a (in fact n) n-dimensional chirality matrices. It
uld be helpful to state this.
have stated this in the revised MS:
sing the fact that any <U+0001D45B> + 1 - dimensional chirality matrix contains <U+0001D45B> submatrices being <U+0001D45B>-
ensional chirality matrices)”.
program in Appendix 5 which is used to prove this result is hard to decipher - either a short
cription (in the Appendix) or some comments in the code would be helpful.
have given a short description of the code algorithm in the text of the revised MS:
iefly, the code algorithm uses recursive/iterative exhaustive search and is as follows. First, we
k up through all possible 5×5 symmetric matrices with the zero diagonal and all possible
binations of entries ±1. Keep those matrices that have a “unique” set of eigenvalues which
ans that if during sorting one comes across a matrix with the same set of eigenvalues as the set
previously found matrix of the unique set, such a matrix is ignored as not being unique.
se matrices that have the set of eigenvalues which coincides with the set of <U+0001D43E>5 are also
ored. Second, we add an additional row (along with the transposed column to keep the matrix
metric) with one zero and all other possible entries ±1 to each of the unique matrices of the
t step to obtain a set of 6× 6 symmetric matrices. While trying all possible entries ±1 for the
ched row/column for each of the matrices we select a “unique” set of 6× 6 symmetric
rices. Then of the selected “unique” ones we sort out those that have 5× 5 symmetric
matrices with the same set of eigenvalues as <U+0001D43E>5 has. Third, the procedure of adding a
/column to the unique matrices and the sorting are repeated again and again until there is no
rix left in the set. As is seen, the largest matrix that can be obtained in this way is the 18× 18
rix given above.”
he reasoning behind the derivation of Q in Section 3 is not explained. Either the algorithm
es 29-34) should be explained or a citation should be given.
have explained the derivation of Q in Section 3 in the revised MS by adding the following:
nfortunately, the chirality matrix is sensitive to the opposite orientations of the lines: if the
ction of a line is switched to the opposite one then the corresponding matrix entries are
ltiplied by -1 and the chirality matrix becomes different. On the other hand, any numerical
ariant based on the chirality matrix should not depend on switching line direction to opposite
cause cylinders are symmetric) and thus one has to construct a matrix that is degenerate
ards opposite line directions. Therefore we introduce a new matrix <U+0001D444> derived from <U+0001D443> which
nvariant with respect to the line orientation as follows (we are using Eq. (9) as an example):
One has to transform the first row in <U+0001D443>(<U+0001D44E>89) into all +1s (it is already so) and to sum up
numbers in the corresponding columns and put the sums into the first row.
One has to transform the second row in <U+0001D443>(<U+0001D44E>89) into all +1s (here by reverting sign in the
h column and then in the sixth row) then to sum up numbers in the corresponding columns
put the sums into the second row.
er proceeding in the same way through the whole matrix of Eq. (9) one gets the symmetric
rix:”.
he statement on lines 51-52 on page 12, that a89 'fits the impossible Penrose triangle' is
iguing but not clear. A verbal or annotated pictorial explaination would be helpful.
ditionally to Fig. 11, in the revised MS we give a verbal explanation:
deed, one can uniformly decorate the three “corner” cubes of the impossible Penrose triangle
h balls as it is shown in Fig. 11. After coloration, the balls on the corner cubes determine the
ition of the lines of the corresponding colors that pass through them. The configuration a89 is
roduced when three pairs of lines (brown-green, cyan-blue, and violet-grey) in Fig. 11 are
ned along the three sides of the triangle so that while going around the central hole (which
uld be filled with the red pivot cylinder to complete a89) and starting from the brown-green
r one can see the right-hand screw of the pair, then the left-hand screw, and finally, the left-
d screw of the violet-grey pair of lines. ”.
