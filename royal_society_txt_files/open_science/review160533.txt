Robbins et al. investigate how maternal investment in western and eastern gorillas influences the
fitness and life-history trajectories of their offspring and how it may ultimately contribute to the
differences between the two species. Their analysis is based on up to 30 years of demographic
data, from 58 groups of gorillas in two study sites, an impressive amount of data. The paper is
really interesting. The introduction is clearly written and the methods are well described. The
conclusions drawn are sufficiently supported by the data. The literature coverage is excellent and
up-to-date but not ignorant of the earlier works that are still relevant. I find both the style and
content of the manuscript fully acceptable for publication in present form. I recommend it for
publication without change.

This is an excellent paper which tries to create a new theory explaining male philopatry in female
dispersal species as gorillas. The authors used the long-term data on demography of two species
of gorillas, and compared the presence of mothers when males reached at maturity in their natal
groups between them. They found the interesting results opposed to the socioecological theory
that the number of adult males is determined by the number of sexually receptive females.
Instead, they suggested that less dispersal of parous females and maternal supports of sons might
constitute a driving force to promote male philopatry in African great apes and humans. This
3
paper is worth publishing as the present form, I think. So my comments are concerned with some
minor alterations in Introduction and Discussion.
Introduction
Page 1, Line 37: Contribution of maternal support of daughters to the post-reproductive lifespan
of humans is not well supported (cf. Bogin, 2009). Here you may indicate higher reproductive
success of Cercopithecus females with supports from their mothers at dominant status (baboons
and macaques).
Results
1. The authors did not present behavioral data concerned with mother’s support of sons,
such as proximity with silverbacks, intervention in conflicts, coalitional support in conflict, etc.
These data will definitely support mother’s contribution to son’s philopatry.
Discussion
1. The definition of familiar male is unclear. It probably means the male with whom the
maturing males grow from their birth. But the degree of familiarity may differ according to their
kin relations (putative father, brother, or half-brother). I hope the authors to take them account
for comparison.
2. Emigration of male long-tailed macaques is accelerated by the competition with resident
adult females (van Noordwijk & van Schaik, 2001). Emigration of male gorillas in both mountain
and western may also be influenced by the harassment of females. The presence of their mothers
possibly ease such influence.
3. Gregariousness among female western gorillas around silverbacks and their reliance on
silverbacks may be different from those of female mountain gorillas. Such data will support the
different social organization between two species of gorillas and may explain why the presence of
mothers does not prevent male dispersal in western gorillas.
4. Evolution of Homininae needs more sentences to explain mother’s contribution to male
philopatry. Recent reports of fossil hominids suggest female dispersal and male philopatry
(Copeland et al, 2011; Lalueza-Fox et al, 2011; Vigilant & Langergraber, 2011). Bonobo mothers
positively support their sons in conflicts, and their presence enables sons to keep dominance
status (Kano, 1992). Multi-leveled structure of human community may permit individuals to keep
extended relationships with their families after dispersal (Chapais, 2011). Mother’s support of
sons should be very important in the evolution of human society. I hope this paper suggesting it
more clearly.

Here is the media summary:
The social organization of gorillas has been used as model for explaining the
evolution of human behaviour, but variations among gorilla species are not well
understood. Here we show that female mountain gorillas remain with their sons
for significantly longer than western gorillas. The presence of the mother may
enhance her son's relationships with other group members, thereby reducing his
incentive to emigrate. Reduced male emigration can help to explain why
multimale groups are more common among mountain gorillas than western
gorillas. Similarly, maternal support could have contributed to the development
of patrilocal societies for chimpanzees, bonobos, and early humans.
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either
include your data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and
include the relevant doi within your manuscript

alterations in Introduction and Discussion.
We thank the reviewer for the positive comments and helpful suggestions. Our responses
are inserted below.
Introduction
Page 1, Line 37: Contribution of maternal support of daughters to the post-reproductive
lifespan of humans is not well supported (cf. Bogin, 2009). Here you may indicate higher
reproductive success of Cercopithecus females with supports from their mothers at
dominant status (baboons and macaques).
We have now cited Bogin (2009) as a potential caveat to the claim that maternal support
of daughters may facilitate the post-reproductive lifespan of humans. The sentence
already referred to dominance relationships of Cercopithecus females.
Results
1. The authors did not present behavioral data concerned with mother’s support of sons,
such as proximity with silverbacks, intervention in conflicts, coalitional support in
conflict, etc. These data will definitely support mother’s contribution to son’s philopatry.
Unfortunately, such data are not available from the present study, but we have cited the
relevant details from Stoinski et al (2009) on lines 32 & 41 of page 5.
Discussion
1. The definition of familiar male is unclear. It probably means the male with whom the
maturing males grow from their birth. But the degree of familiarity may differ according
to their kin relations (putative father, brother, or half-brother). I hope the authors to take
them account for comparison.
We have now reworded to clarify the definition, including explicit acknowledgment of
potential differences in the degree of familiarity (Page 5, line 47).
2. Emigration of male long-tailed macaques is accelerated by the competition with
resident adult females (van Noordwijk & van Schaik, 2001). Emigration of male gorillas
in both mountain and western may also be influenced by the harassment of females. The
presence of their mothers possibly ease such influence.
Harassment by females has not been considered a major influence on the emigration of
male gorillas. Adult females are almost always submissive toward the much larger
silverbacks.
3. Gregariousness among female western gorillas around silverbacks and their reliance on
silverbacks may be different from those of female mountain gorillas. Such data will
support the different social organization between two species of gorillas and may explain
why the presence of mothers does not prevent male dispersal in western gorillas.
We have now noted that spacing between western gorillas may be greater than mountain
gorillas, so even if a male western gorilla can maintain proximity with his mother, he
may not gain much access to other adult females (Page 12, line 10).
4. Evolution of Homininae needs more sentences to explain mother’s contribution to
male philopatry. Recent reports of fossil hominids suggest female dispersal and male
philopatry (Copeland et al, 2011; Lalueza-Fox et al, 2011; Vigilant & Langergraber,
2011). Bonobo mothers positively support their sons in conflicts, and their presence
enables sons to keep dominance status (Kano, 1992). Multi-leveled structure of human
community may permit individuals to keep extended relationships with their families
after dispersal (Chapais, 2011). Mother’s support of sons should be very important in the
evolution of human society. I hope this paper suggesting it more clearly.
We have now added some of the suggested citations (Page 14, line 45), as well as a
Figure to clarify the proposed evolution of male philopatry among Homininae.
