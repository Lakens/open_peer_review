Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
Referee report on the ms “Enhanced virus filtration in hybrid membranes with
MWCNT nanocomposite” by Nemeth et al.
The work deals with fabrication and testing of carbon nanotubes (CNT) based
composite filtration membrane for removing viruses from water. The filter
consists of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and Multi-walled CNT decorated
with various nanoparticles. The virus retention (MS2 bacteriophages) scaled
with the % of CNTs and depended on the pH, as well. The best results were
obtained with Cu2O-containing samples.
The starting materials and the filter were thoroughly characterized (x-rays,
TEM, Raman, zeta potential), the parameters were varied in a broad range,
there are no loose ends. The literature is well cited and the manuscript is very
well written, the figures are nice. I am impressed by this work, it is one of the
best I have read in this topic. I can fully support the publication of this work.
A follow-up work could be to test the filter performance under illumination.
My guess is that the efficiency would increase, the number of “vital” MS2
bacteriophages would decrease, due to the hyperthermia pasteurization
coming from the heating up of the CNTs with light, and thee photocatalytic
effect of nanoparticles. It is very likely, that filters decorated with TiO2

Response to the comments of Reviewer 1
We thank Reviewer 1 for their careful reading of our manuscript. We are grateful for
the positive feedback.
Reviewer 1: “A follow-up work could be to test the filter performance under
illumination. My guess is that the efficiency would increase, the number of “vital”
MS2 bacteriophages would decrease, due to the hyperthermia pasteurization
coming from the heating up of the CNTs with light, and the photocatalytic effect of
nanoparticles.”
Author’s response: We fully agree with Reviewer 1 on this matter. This proposition
could potentially enhance the performance of our filter by several magnitudes, since
more characteristics of the nanotubes would be exploited. Similar studies have
already been conducted in our laboratory, and further experiments will focus on the
illumination of the samples.
Response to the comments of Reviewer 2
We are grateful for the comments of Reviewer 1 for his/her careful reading of our
manuscript, and their detailed comments that we have addressed. The modifications
based on his/her comments greatly improved the manuscript.
Reviewer 2: “Sigma-Aldrich does not exist”.
Author’s reply: We agree that changes have been in place in the company structures,
which today would suggest us to use Merck as distributor. However, the chemicals
used in these experiments were ordered from the original Sigma-Aldrich company
and thus the source of chemicals is correct as written.
Reviewer 2: “In the formula of Flux (F) superindices must be used.”
Author’s reply: The formula has been corrected accordingly.
Reviewer 2: comments on reference formats
Author’s reply: We thank the Reviewer for his/her careful consideration of the
Reference list, and the detailed description of mistakes in the references. We used
the tools proposed on the website for reference editing, and all the points have been
addressed in the revised manuscript.
