label_comment_1
This is an interesting and well written manuscript that describes a new fossil specimen of
aetiocetid, a stem mysticete, and includes commentary and analysis on stem mysticete
systematics and functional biology, particularly of feeding. I expect that some of the conclusions
the authors draw may prove controversial, especially since other paleontologists have staked
competing claims about phylogenies and feeding methods. Having not observed these specimens
directly (including the new specimen described here), I must rely on the expertise of author—
both the authors of this manuscript under review, as well other experts who have described
similar and closely related aetiocetids of various genera. In short, I find the systematic and
functional arguments advanced here to be persuasive and compelling, and I find myself agreeing
with the authors. Their argument is sensible, they make many strong points, and I cannot find
flaws or holes in their argument.
Much of the “meat” (and text) of the paper is a detailed description of the newly described
Salishcetus meadi specimen, UWBM 50004. The descriptions seem good to me—clear and with
appropriate terminology. Again, however, I have not seen the specimen, so I cannot vouch for
accuracy of these descriptions.
Still, there is much in this manuscript concerning the ramifications of this specimen, particularly
A) its taxonomic position and B) the functional consequences of its morphology, especially its
dentition.
Regarding descriptions, one word that is used repeatedly is “sidedness.” I know precisely what
the authors mean by this term, but I can’t recall having ever seen this term before. I expect that
other readers will, like me, understand what is meant, but perhaps the authors—if they cannot
find another suitable word—can define this term.
There are a few other awkward turns of phrase (such as “has led to their interpretation as that
they represent,” in line 627), but for the most part the writing is admirably concise and clear. In
line 51: “confirmed by multiple phylogenetic” what… studies?
One can hardly disagree that phylogeny within Aetiocetidae—and between aetiocetids and other
early mysticetes—must be resolved before drawing conclusions about feeding ecology of these
taxa.
Also, I heartily agree that “aetiocetid morphology bears only on inferences about the evolution
and origin of filter feeding in mysticetes if we can accurately resolve the ancestral condition for
the clade” (lines 637-639). Amen to that!
It seems pretty certain that aetiocetids were “potential intermediate forms” (line 52) between
crown mysticetes and the earliest mysticetes, at least in phylogenetic terms. The (big) question is,
were they, as is often assumed, functionally intermediate between toothed and edentulous
mysticetes, with the ecological consequences (i.e., feeding methods) that go along with this
morphology.
With regard to the systematics, I like the renaming/recombination the authors’ analysis has led
them to, including Aetiocetus tomitai and Morawanocetus yabukii as (now) Chonecetus tomitai
3
and C. yabukii. Thus the authors’ “best” tree leads to a now-monophyletic genus Aetiocetus—
“given this revision,” as stated in line 617, although they argue earlier (line 603) that they “do not
recover a monophyletic Aetiocetus spp.” This might be confusing to someone who is not paying
attention, but I think the explanation, and the tree diagram (Figure 10) make this clear.
With regard to morphology, I think the authors are on firm ground with the contentions they
make about dentition and feeding methods. I agree that the teeth of many aetiocetids seem to be
“used… for shearing and prey processing” (line 648), with tight occlusion. The authors make a
good case that dental simplification is a derived trait for Aetiocetus that is “unrelated to the loss
of dentition in crown Mysticeti” (line 656), and that although some early toothed mysticetes,
including aetiocetids (and Mammalodon), may have been specialized suction feeders, some
degree of suction is not that unusual or noteworthy because suction is often used for aquatic
intraoral transport of grasped prey by raptorial feeders. I am in wholehearted agreement with
this claim. It is interesting to read the authors’ thoughts about various specimens, even if (like
NMV P252567) they are not the direct subjects of this study.
Likewise the authors’ conclusions about “proto-baleen” and the origins of baleen will likely not
be viewed favorably by all experts, but I think the authors make a good case here. I have long
thought that many paleontologists are too enamored of a small number of palatal foramina,
which can be found in many mammals, as implying the presence of baleen or proto-baleen. I
think this is usually a case of wishful thinking. As a result, I concur that many claims about proto-
baleen are “dubious” (line 701). I think the true answers to long-sought questions about the
origins of baleen and bulk filter feeding are to be found among species that—as the authors nicely
put it—“lie closer to crown Mysticeti” (line 712) rather than with aetiocetids or other stem
mysticetes. I couldn’t agree more.
So I am left with a few questions for the authors. First, the exact wording of the title of the ms
(”diversity of feeding modes”) seems a bit odd to me, given that the authors are arguing that
there is in fact less diversity than often presumed, with most aetiocetids being raptorial feeders
aside from a putative suction-feeding specialist. I understand what the authors mean by this
title—and they certainly discuss various proposed feeding methods for aetiocetids—but in fact
they conclude that raptorial feeding dominates, with less diversity than other researchers have
proposed. I am not lobbying for a title change, but it seems a bit confusing or inaccurate relative
to the conclusions they reach.
In terms of this feeding diversity, some researchers have argued that palatal foramina relate not
necessarily to baleen or proto-baleen but instead to extensive gingival tissue that might aid in
creating an oral seal for suction, or perhaps better grasping of prey. Can the authors comment on
this?
Much of the authors’ functional analysis is based on the dentition of Salishcetus. There is also a
very extensive description of the mandible. Do other bony features (vertebrae, bullae, palate, etc.)
offer any evidence with regard to feeding methods?
I wonder if the authors can say anything about Sitsqwayk, which—although surrounded by
many questions—is an intriguing specimen. Aside from fitting somewhere within stem
mysticetes, likely somewhere between aetiocetids and chaeomysticetes, is there anything else
relevant here?
Finally, in terms of body size, I think the authors’ estimate for Salishcetus (of approximately 3m
total body length) seems reasonable, but aetiocetids had a fairly wide range of body length (up to,
I think, nearly 8-10m). Does this have impact on feeding diversity within this family?

Review of RSOS-172336 by Erich Fitzgerald (Museums Victoria)
Peredo & Pyenson describe a new taxon of aetiocetid mysticete from the Oligocene of
Washington State based on a diagnostic partial cranium (including ear bones) and nearly
complete mandibular morphology and lower dentition. The overall interpretation of the
phylogenetic position and evolutionary implications of the new aetiocetid and aetiocetid
phylogeny is generally sound and I agree with the main findings of the paper: (1) identification of
a new species of aetiocetid mysticete; (2) corroboration of the hypothesis that Aetiocetidae are
monophyletic; (3) the need for taxonomic revision of nominal species within Aetiocetidae; (4) that
previously published interpretations of 'proto-baleen' alongside functional teeth in Aetiocetidae
is inadequately substantiated by available evidence; and (5) the important observation and
discussion of the complexity of the transition from raptorial feeding with teeth to filter feeding
with baleen in early mysticetes. These primary findings make this paper well worth publishing
following revisions that I think are needed to improve both the scientific aspects of the paper as
well as presentation of data. Please see my annotations to the manuscript PDF for detailed
comments/corrections. In addition, some general suggestions for improving the manuscript
follow below:
1. Diagnosis of the new species Salishicetus meadi: First, it would be useful if the authors include
in their diagnosis the combination of characters (derived and primitive) that diagnose the type
specimen of Salishicetus as an aetiocetid. Secondly, 2 of the characters used to diagnose UWBM
50004 as a new species are based on the morphology of the anterior end of the mandible.
However, the apex of the mandible looks broken to me. Could it be that the supposedly
diagnostic morphology of the apex of the mandible in UWBM 50004 reflects incomplete fossil
preservation rather than real autapomorphy? If the interpretation that the mandible is broken
anteriorly is more likely than weird morphology, what are the implications for how diagnostic
UWBM 50004 is as a holotype? The third nominal diagnostic character relating to parallel
striae/ridges on the pars cochlearis, dorsal to the fenestra rotunda, sounds reasonable, but they
are not especially clear (nor labeled) in the figures supplied. I note here that very similar-looking
structures occur in the periotic of an undescribed mammalodontid from Australia (NMV P48794),
5
which is figured in Fitzgerald (2010. ZJLS), but I have not seen such features in any other toothed
mysticete periotic (excluding UWBM 50004). In sum, I encourage the authors to reconsider and
rewrite their diagnosis of Salishicetus so that there is more detail on what features make this
specimen distinct and diagnosable from previously described taxa.
2. Some of the issues raised above are compounded by the less-than-optimal illustration of key
anatomical regions of UWBM 50004, which made it difficult for me to independently evaluate
certain identifications of morphology and comparisons between taxa/specimens. While the 3D
models are nice in aiding interpretation of specimens (the reconstruction of the mandible from
asymmetrically preserved left and right sides is brilliant), I think it is vital to illustrate the original
fossil specimens, especially when describing a new taxon. The 3D models of the tympanic bulla,
mandibles + dentition are simply no replacement for some macro-photographs of the original
elements. The apparently complete thoracic vertebra and incus are not illustrated in figures,
meaning I can't evaluate the description of these preserved elements. Ideally, the periotic +
surrounding auditory region of the basicranium; tympanic bulla; and teeth should be whitened
with ammonium chloride and photographed in close-up detail using a macro lens. I realise that
facilities for ammonium chloride coating of specimens are not available everywhere, but if at all
possible it would be very useful to other specialists in the field if UWBM 50004 were
photographed and illustrated using this technique. This is especially the case here where the ear
bones, dentition and possibly mandible, are the most diagnostic preserved elements. Lastly, none
of the figures of the fossils include a scale bar or any other indication of scale! It is essential to
include this.
3. Anatomical terminology is used inconsistently and/or incorrectly throughout the text and
figures (see annotated PDF for specifics). For example: foramen ovale and fenestra ovale are both
used for the periotic feature that should be correctly referred to as the fenestra ovalis. Please
ensure that one set of terms is decided upon and then used uniformly and accurately.
4. The discussion of phylogenetic analysis protocols and results are missing explanation of basic
decisions, such as: choice of character/taxon data matrix for analysis; using a 50% majority rule
consensus tree and not the strict consensus tree to interpret the phylogenetic hypothesis; not
providing any basic measure of statistical support fro the various clades in the tree/s. I am not
arguing that these decisions are wrong, just that it would be helpful if the authors explained the
reasoning behind them.
5. The Description text is in part a comparative description, but there are very few detailed
comparisons in the text of the morphology of the periotic, tympanic bulla and teeth of UWBM
50004 with the morphology of these elements in at least other aetiocetid taxa. These elements
have not been adequately described across Aetiocetidae, with the exception of Fucaia buelli, so
more detailed comparisons between UWBM 50004 and other aetiocetids could reveal additional
characters of phylogenetic significance, especially with respect to the diagnosis of Salishicetus as
a distinct taxon, relationships and taxonomy within Aetiocetidae, and the controversial
relationship between Aetiocetidae and Mammalodontidae. (Appendix A)

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
I very much enjoyed reviewing this paper, which I think the authors have done a fine job crafting.
The question of how baleen evolved within mysticete whales is perplexing and can only be
answered by discoveries of specimens like this. Though incomplete, the elements preserved are
sufficient to place this species within the Aetiocetidae and further refine the placement of this
family among other groups of early mysticetes. As such, I think this paper is an excellent
contribution to the journal and look forward to seeing it in print.
Aside from a few comments on spelling, grammar, and wording that I list below, my only
requests of the authors are minor and are simply meant to clarify a couple points made in the
paper.
The first request is the inclusion of images highlighting the wear features on the teeth and
embrasure pits on the dentaries. Photos and 3D models of these elements are available (Figs. 8-9)
but are of insufficient resolution to make out these features, which are an important part of the
authors' argument regarding feeding style in this specimen. Also, I could not find scale bars for
the specimens; did I miss these?
The second request is for more detailed information on the calculations used to estimate the total
length of this specimen. Besides uncertainty in the estimated bizygomatic width of this specimen,
there is additional uncertainty in the equation used for this calculation. Acknowledging these
uncertainties directly or by reporting a possible size range for the specimen would be helpful.
Other minor comments:
P3, L51: I think a word is missing after "phylogenetic", maybe "studies" or "analyses"?
P8, L149: Remove comma after longitudinal degrees (123 07' 08.23 W).
P8, L152: Define PBDB.
P9, L169: Hyphenate "spear-shaped"
P23, L463-464: Either take out "of" or add "the" to "All of teeth preserve…"
P25, L545: Change "of" to "or".
P25, L550: The word "data" is plural.
P26: Just a comment that I appreciated the detailed description you provided when explaining
how you determined the positions of the teeth in the left and right dentaries. Nice job.
P29, L627-628: Wording here is confusing. I suggest rewriting as "The position of aetiocetids in
mysticete phylogeny has led to their interpretation as intermediate forms" or "as intermediate in
form".
P30, L650: add "than" to "larger overall those of".

Review of RSOS-172336 by Erich Fitzgerald (Museums Victoria)
Peredo & Pyenson describe a new taxon of aetiocetid mysticete from the Oligocene of
Washington State based on a diagnostic partial cranium (including ear bones) and nearly
complete mandibular morphology and lower dentition. The overall interpretation of the
phylogenetic position and evolutionary implications of the new aetiocetid and aetiocetid
phylogeny is generally sound and I agree with the main findings of the paper: (1) identification of
a new species of aetiocetid mysticete; (2) corroboration of the hypothesis that Aetiocetidae are
monophyletic; (3) the need for taxonomic revision of nominal species within Aetiocetidae; (4) that
previously published interpretations of 'proto-baleen' alongside functional teeth in Aetiocetidae
is inadequately substantiated by available evidence; and (5) the important observation and
discussion of the complexity of the transition from raptorial feeding with teeth to filter feeding
with baleen in early mysticetes. These primary findings make this paper well worth publishing
following revisions that I think are needed to improve both the scientific aspects of the paper as
well as presentation of data. Please see my annotations to the manuscript PDF for detailed
comments/corrections. In addition, some general suggestions for improving the manuscript
follow below:
1. Diagnosis of the new species Salishicetus meadi: First, it would be useful if the authors include

mysticete periotic (excluding UWBM 50004). In sum, I encourage the authors to reconsider and
rewrite their diagnosis of Salishicetus so that there is more detail on what features make this
specimen distinct and diagnosable from previously described taxa.
2. Some of the issues raised above are compounded by the less-than-optimal illustration of key
anatomical regions of UWBM 50004, which made it difficult for me to independently evaluate
certain identifications of morphology and comparisons between taxa/specimens. While the 3D
models are nice in aiding interpretation of specimens (the reconstruction of the mandible from
asymmetrically preserved left and right sides is brilliant), I think it is vital to illustrate the original
fossil specimens, especially when describing a new taxon. The 3D models of the tympanic bulla,
mandibles + dentition are simply no replacement for some macro-photographs of the original
elements. The apparently complete thoracic vertebra and incus are not illustrated in figures,
meaning I can't evaluate the description of these preserved elements. Ideally, the periotic +
surrounding auditory region of the basicranium; tympanic bulla; and teeth should be whitened
12
with ammonium chloride and photographed in close-up detail using a macro lens. I realise that
facilities for ammonium chloride coating of specimens are not available everywhere, but if at all
possible it would be very useful to other specialists in the field if UWBM 50004 were
photographed and illustrated using this technique. This is especially the case here where the ear
bones, dentition and possibly mandible, are the most diagnostic preserved elements. Lastly, none
of the figures of the fossils include a scale bar or any other indication of scale! It is essential to
include this.
3. Anatomical terminology is used inconsistently and/or incorrectly throughout the text and
figures (see annotated PDF for specifics). For example: foramen ovale and fenestra ovale are both
used for the periotic feature that should be correctly referred to as the fenestra ovalis. Please
ensure that one set of terms is decided upon and then used uniformly and accurately.
4. The discussion of phylogenetic analysis protocols and results are missing explanation of basic
decisions, such as: choice of character/taxon data matrix for analysis; using a 50% majority rule
consensus tree and not the strict consensus tree to interpret the phylogenetic hypothesis; not
providing any basic measure of statistical support fro the various clades in the tree/s. I am not
arguing that these decisions are wrong, just that it would be helpful if the authors explained the
reasoning behind them.
5. The Description text is in part a comparative description, but there are very few detailed
comparisons in the text of the morphology of the periotic, tympanic bulla and teeth of UWBM
50004 with the morphology of these elements in at least other aetiocetid taxa. These elements
have not been adequately described across Aetiocetidae, with the exception of Fucaia buelli, so
more detailed comparisons between UWBM 50004 and other aetiocetids could reveal additional
characters of phylogenetic significance, especially with respect to the diagnosis of Salishicetus as
a distinct taxon, relationships and taxonomy within Aetiocetidae, and the controversial
relationship between Aetiocetidae and Mammalodontidae.

Comments to the Author(s)
I very much enjoyed reviewing this paper, which I think the authors have done a fine job crafting.
The question of how baleen evolved within mysticete whales is perplexing and can only be
answered by discoveries of specimens like this. Though incomplete, the elements preserved are
sufficient to place this species within the Aetiocetidae and further refine the placement of this
family among other groups of early mysticetes. As such, I think this paper is an excellent
contribution to the journal and look forward to seeing it in print.
Aside from a few comments on spelling, grammar, and wording that I list below, my only
requests of the authors are minor and are simply meant to clarify a couple points made in the
paper.
The first request is the inclusion of images highlighting the wear features on the teeth and
embrasure pits on the dentaries. Photos and 3D models of these elements are available (Figs. 8-9)
but are of insufficient resolution to make out these features, which are an important part of the
authors' argument regarding feeding style in this specimen. Also, I could not find scale bars for
the specimens; did I miss these?
The second request is for more detailed information on the calculations used to estimate the total
length of this specimen. Besides uncertainty in the estimated bizygomatic width of this specimen,
13
there is additional uncertainty in the equation used for this calculation. Acknowledging these
uncertainties directly or by reporting a possible size range for the specimen would be helpful.
Other minor comments:
P3, L51: I think a word is missing after "phylogenetic", maybe "studies" or "analyses"?
P8, L149: Remove comma after longitudinal degrees (123 07' 08.23 W).
P8, L152: Define PBDB.
P9, L169: Hyphenate "spear-shaped"
P23, L463-464: Either take out "of" or add "the" to "All of teeth preserve…"
P25, L545: Change "of" to "or".
P25, L550: The word "data" is plural.
P26: Just a comment that I appreciated the detailed description you provided when explaining
how you determined the positions of the teeth in the left and right dentaries. Nice job.
P29, L627-628: Wording here is confusing. I suggest rewriting as "The position of aetiocetids in
mysticete phylogeny has led to their interpretation as intermediate forms" or "as intermediate in
form".
P30, L650: add "than" to "larger overall those of".

3 12 ABSTRACT
4
5
6 13 Living baleen whales, or Mysticeti, lack teeth and instead feed using keratinous baleen
7
8 14 plates to sieve prey-laden water. This feeding strategy is profoundly different from that of
9
10 15 their toothed ancestors, which processed prey using the differentiated dentition
11
12
13
16 characteristic of mammals. The fossil record of mysticetes reveals stem members that
14
15 17 include extinct taxa with dentition, illuminating the morphological states that preceded
16
17 18 the loss of teeth and the subsequent origin of baleen. The relationships among stem
18
19
19 mysticetes, including putative clades such as Mammalodontidae and Aetiocetidae, remain
20
21
22 20 debatable. Aetiocetids are among the more species-rich clade of stem mysticetes, and
23
24 21 known only from fossil localities along the North Pacific coastline. Here, we report a new
25
26 22 aetiocetid, Salishicetus meadi gen. et sp. nov, from the late Oligocene of Washington
27
28
29 23 State, USA. Salishicetus preserves a complete lower dentition with extensive occlusal
30
31 24 wear, indicating that it processed prey using shearing cheek teeth in the same way as its
32
33 25 stem cetacean ancestors. Using a matrix with all known species of aetiocetids, we recover
34
35
36
26 a monophyletic Aetiocetidae, crownward of a basal clade of Mammalodontidae. The
37
38 27 description of Salishicetus resolves phylogenetic relationships among aetiocetids, which
39
40 28 provides a basis for reconstructing ancestral feeding morphology along the stem leading
41
42
29 to crown Mysticeti.

3 33 1. Introduction
4
5
6 34 Today’s living cetaceans represent two major clades that possess fundamentally different
7
8 35 innovations related to feeding underwater: Mysticeti, or baleen whales, which filter-feed; and
9
10 36 Odontoceti, or toothed whales, which echolocate underwater to find their prey [1, 2]. Both
11
12
13
37 innovations are unique to these clades, and are likely important components of the diversification
14
15 38 of these two groups since their late Eocene origin, subsequent to the initial land-sea transition in
16
17 39 stem cetaceans. The origins of both evolutionary innovations (i.e., filter-feeding and
18
19
40 echolocation) in crown cetaceans remain unclear. Recently, a bevy of new fossil material from
20
21
22 41 the stem lineage of Mysticeti have provided a new basis for proposing different hypotheses about
23
24 42 the evolution of filter-feeding. Embryological and fossil data converge in showing that the
25
26 43 earliest baleen whales (i.e., stem mysticetes) possessed teeth (and lacked baleen); the subsequent
27
28
29 44 transformation to edentulous baleen-bearing mysticetes from this ancestral state is among the
30
31 45 more enigmatic questions in cetacean evolution.
32
33 46 Aetiocetidae represent a clade of stem mysticetes that possessed teeth and have
34
35
36
47 historically been valuable in understanding these transitional states in baleen whale evolution.
37
38 48 Aetiocetids have been found in Oligocene age rocks along the North Pacific Ocean [3, 4].
39
40 49 Initially, aetiocetids were interpreted as archaeocete or stem cetaceans [4, 5]. However, Van
41
42
50 Valen [6] identified them as stem mysticetes, which has been confirmed by multiple
43
44
45 51 phylogenetic [3, 7, 8]. As stem Mysticeti, aetiocetids have been interpreted as potential
46
47 52 intermediate forms between their toothed ancestors from the Eocene [9, 10] and baleen bearing,
48
49 53 edentulous mysticetes. Consequently, questions about their feeding morphology and their role in
50
51
52 54 the evolution of filter feeding have come under scrutiny. Authors have proposed that aetiocetids
53
54 55 were raptorial feeding [3, 11], filter feeding assisted by proto-baleen [8, 12], and suction feeding

3 56 [13]. Peredo et al. [14] provides a full review and framework of these feeding hypotheses across
4
5
6 57 stem Mysticeti.
7
8 58 Interestingly, the phylogenetic relationships among aetiocetids and their position relative
9
10 59 to other stem mysticete clades (such as the Mammalodontidae and Eomysticetidae) are
11
12
13
60 inconsistently resolved across different analyses. Some phylogenies [8, 15] recover aetiocetids
14
15 61 crown-ward of mammalodontids, while others recover a monophyletic Mammalodontidae +
16
17 62 Aetiocetidae [7, 11, 16]. This inconsistency is problematic for interpreting aetiocetid feeding
18
19
63 morphology as it relates to hypotheses for the loss of teeth, origin of baleen, or the evolution of
20
21
22 64 filter feeding [14]. Given the broad diversity of feeding morphology observed in stem
23
24 65 mysticetes, it is critical to reconcile their phylogenetic relationships. Absent a robust
25
26 66 phylogenetic hypothesis, the sequence of transitional morphological states connecting crown
27
28
29 67 mysticetes to stem cetaceans remains obscure—i.e., any single inferred feeding mode lacks the
30
31 68 phylogenetic context necessary to test explicit hypotheses related to the evolution of mysticete
32
33 69 feeding.
34
35
36
70 Here we describe a new genus and species of aetiocetid with a partial basicranium, a
37
38 71 complete tympanoperiotic complex, elements of both dentaries, and a nearly complete lower
39
40 72 dentition. We present the first phylogenetic analysis to include every species of aetiocetid,
41
42
73 including both species of Fucaia and the rarely coded Chonecetus sookensis. In doing so, we
43
44
45 74 revise aetiocetid taxonomy and comment on inter-relationships within Aetiocetidae. Finally, we
46
47 75 discuss the breadth of feeding morphologies across aetiocetids within this new phylogenetic
48
49 76 context and comment on their implications for the evolution of filter feeding in Mysticeti.

6 80 The holotype skull and mandibles of Salishicetus meadi were scanned using Nikon
7
8 81 Metrology’s combined 225/450 kV microfocus X-ray and computed tomography (CT) walk-in
9
10 82 vault system at National Technical Systems in Belcamp, Maryland, USA, with a slice thickness

39
40 95 added the character state coding for Matapanui waihao from [19] and, in an effort to test the
41
42
96 monophyly of Aetiocetidae, coded Fucaia buelli, Morawanocetus yabukii, Chonecetus

21
22 154 Age. What is now the Lincoln Creek Formation was originally identified in Thurston and
23
24 155 Lincoln counties by Weaver [22] who used the name Lincoln Formation and regarded the entire
25
26
156 outcrop as Oligocene in age. This name was preoccupied by Eocene rocks in Colorado,
27
28
29 157 prompting Beikman et al. [23] to use the name Lincoln Creek Formation instead. These authors
30
31 158 note that, although the name Lincoln Creek Formation is taken from Lincoln Creek in Lewis
32
33 159 County, Washington, the rocks in this area are minimally exposed. Instead, these authors
34
35
36 160 designated the type section of the Lincoln Creek Formation as the rocks exposed along the
37
38 161 Chehalis River from Galvin to Helsing Junction. These authors considered the Lincoln Creek
39
40 162 Formation to range from late Eocene to early Miocene. Specifically, they identify the type
41
42
43 163 section at Helsing Junction as late Oligocene in age and correlated with the type Blakeley
44
45 164 Formation of Weaver [22]. This late Oligocene age is consistent with biostratigraphic ages from
46
47 165 nearby fossil mollusk localities reported by Miller [24] and Schenck [25].

172 4.1. Overview
14
15 173 Anatomical terminology follows Mead and Fordyce [26]. Description of the skull refers
16
17 174 to either the right or left side, whichever is most complete, unless otherwise stated. Any
18
19
175 asymmetry observed is noted. The mandibles of Salishicetus meadi are described separately
20
21
22 176 herein, although together they represent nearly a complete mandible.
23
24 177
25
26 178 4.2. Skull
27
28
29 179 The holotype skull of Salishicetus meadi (UWBM 50004) consists of an incomplete
30
31 180 basicranium (figures. 1–5) with the periotic (figure. 6) preserved in articulation and the tympanic
32
33 181 bulla preserved in isolation (fig. 7). The posteriormost portions of the supraoccipital shield are
34
35
36
182 preserved along with the right nuchal crest, the right squamosal and zygomatic process, and the
37
38 183 right exoccipital. Both occipital condyles are preserved, though no basioccipital is present. The
39
40 184 temporal wall preserves the dorsal and posteriormost margin of the parietal.
41
42
185
43
44
45 186 4.3. Squamosal
46
47 187 The right squamosal is preserved in the temporal wall and extending down to the
48
49 188 squamosal fossa, and includes the right zygomatic process. In the temporal wall, the surface of
50
51
52 189 the squamosal is concave so that in dorsal view it is hidden by the overhanging nuchal crest. The
53
54 190 squamosal-parietal suture preserves as a tight articulation between the two bones but is not fused,
55

58

2
3 191 resembling the condition seen in Aetiocetus cotylalveus. This suture begins posteriorly at the
4
5
6 192 nuchal crest and extends horizontally to a position in line with the midpoint of the zygomatic
7
8 193 process. At this point, the suture turns nearly ninety degrees ventrally and runs to the floor of the
9
10 194 squamosal fossa. This morphology differs from the condition seen in Aetiocetus cotylalveus,
11
12
13
195 which has a sinusoidal squamosal-parietal suture that extends dorsal for some length before
14
15 196 turning ventrally. Aetiocetus cotylalveus has a deep, lobate projection of the squamosal pinching
16
17 197 the parietal near the nuchal crest. Salishicetus meadi instead has a fat dorsal margin of the
18
19
198 squamosal that angles sharply at its anterior termination.
20
21
22 199 As the squamosal transitions laterally from the temporal wall towards the squamosal
23
24 200 fossa it becomes less steep, though it never becomes horizontal as in Aetiocetus cotylalveus. As a
25
26 201 result, the squamosal basin in Salishicetus bears a heavy anterior and somewhat lateral
27
28
29 202 inclination, in stark contrast to the dorsally facing squamosal basin of Aetiocetus cotylalveus.
30
31 203 Consequently, the squamosal fossa in Salishicetus recedes posteriorly and opens facing
32
33 204 anteriorly instead of dorsally as in many stem mysticetes.
34
35
36
205 On the dorsal surface, the nuchal crest transitions smoothly into the supramastoid crest as
37
38 206 it passes from the braincase to the lateral region of the squamosal. It remains distinct, if
39
40 207 somewhat blunt and rounded, as it moves anteriorly over the body of the squamosal but becomes
41
42
208 almost indistinct as it transitions onto the zygomatic process. Consequently, the dorsal surface of
43
44
45 209 the zygomatic in Salishicetus is gently rounded in cross-section.
46
47 210 Posteriorly, the squamosal contacts the exoccipital at a loose suture. Though the bones
48
49 211 are in tight articulation deep within the skull, at the surface the two bones do not fully articulate.
50
51
52 212 This gap appears as somewhat of an open suture that is a deep trough for most of its length.
53
54 213 Immediately anterior to this suture lies the main body of the squamosal dorsal to the postglenoid
55
56

Page 11 of 48 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 214 process and the glenoid fossa. At this level, the squamosal is dorsoventrally thickened and
4
5
6 215 robust. The dorsal margin is extremely elongate compared to that of Aetiocetus cotylalveus so
7
8 216 that there is an overall robust and pronounced body of the squamosal, at the base of the
9
10 217 zygomatic process, that is separate and distinct from the squamosal basin.
11
12
13
218 In ventral view, the squamosal preserves a dorsoventrally deep and anteroposteriorly
14
15 219 broad external acoustic meatus that originates at the lateral margin of the periotic and moves
16
17 220 posterolaterally to the lateral margin of the skull. The external acoustic meatus is bound
18
19
221 posteriorly by the paraoccipital process of the exoccipital and anteriorly by the postglenoid
20
21
22 222 process of the squamosal. The postglenoid process is angled ventrally with minimal anterior
23
24 223 hooking or recurvature. At its base, the postglenoid process is broad both transversely and
25
26 224 anteroposteriorly but it becomes anteroposteriorly thin moving ventrally so that at its apex it is a
27
28
29 225 thin, blade-like structure. Overall, the postglenoid process is dorsoventrally short compared to
30
31 226 other aetiocetids, resulting in a comparatively shallow glenoid fossa.
32
33 227 The zygomatic process is preserved for some distance, though its distal tip is broken and
34
35
36
228 missing. In lateral view, it preserves a straight dorsal margin and a gently concave ventral
37
38 229 margin, giving it a gentle dorsal arch. In dorsal view the zygomatic process bears a slight lateral
39
40 230 deflection. Though the distal tip is broken, there is no evidence to suggest any globular or
41
42
231 bulbous inflammation as seen in the zygomatic process of Aetiocetus cotylalveus.
43
44
45 232
46
47 233 4.4. Supraoccipital
48
49 234 The right lateral margin of the supraoccipital is preserved to about the level of the
50
51
52 235 midpoint of the zygomatic process. At this level, the supraoccipital slopes steeply up the nuchal
53
54 236 crest, which preserves a sharp keel. The nuchal crest is deflected laterally so that it substantially
55
56

58
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 12 of 48

2
3 237 overhangs the temporal wall. This condition differs from the nuchal crest of Aetiocetus
4
5
6 238 cotylalveus which preserves only a slight lateral deflection of the nuchal crest; Chonecetus spp.
7
8 239 show little to no such overhang. Posteriorly, the supraoccipital descends steeply towards the
9
10 240 occipital condyles where it contacts the exoccipital. The suture with the exoccipital is fully fused
11
12
13
241 and not visible. Though badly broken and poorly preserved, the supraoccipital is overall steeply
14
15 242 inclined dorsally moving anteriorly. This condition is drastically different from Aetiocetus
16
17 243 cotylalveus and Aetiocetus weltoni, which preserve a shallower anterior inclination of the
18
19
244 supraoccipital, but appears more similar to Chonecetus spp. and Fucaia goedertorum.
20
21
22 245
23
24 246 4.5. Exoccipital
25
26 247 The exoccipital preserves as a dorsoventrally tall and transversely wide plate of bone
27
28
29 248 lying lateral to the occipital condyle. Dorsally it contacts the supraoccipital at a suture that is
30
31 249 fused and obscured. Laterally and anteriorly it contacts the squamosal at a suture that, in
32
33 250 posterior view, is laterally convex so that it creates a rounded lateral margin of the exoccipital.
34
35
36
251 As mentioned above, this suture is tight deep in the skull but loose at the surface so that,
37
38 252 superficially, some space exists between the exoccipital and the squamosal. At its lateral margin
39
40 253 the exoccipital thickens anteroposteriorly so that it lies well posterior to the posterior termination
41
42
254 of the squamosal. In lateral view, the exoccipital is posteriorly concave, so that it preserves as a
43
44
45 255 deep pit or valley between the lateral margin and the occipital condyle.
46
47 256 In posterior view, the shape of medial margin of occipital condyles makes this feature
48
49 257 appear semicircular, not reniform, in Salishicetus. The medial margins of the occipital condyles
50
51
52 258 are aligned nearly dorsoventrally, with a slight lateral inclination, and are straight, not concave.
53
54 259 The foramen magnum is oval in shape, with a curved dorsal margin and the aforementioned
55

1
2
3 260 straight, laterally deflected lateral margins. The ventral margin of the foramen magnum is not
4
5
6 261 preserved.
7
8 262 At its ventral margin, the exoccipital transitions into the paroccipital process. In lateral
9
10 263 view the paroccipital process reaches nearly the same level posteriorly as the occipital condyles.
11
12
13
264 In posterior view it preserves as a triangular ventral projection of the exoccipital that reaches a
14
15 265 level far ventral to that of the postglenoid process of the squamosal. The apex is notably
16
17 266 deflected medially, so that it has a steep, ventrally oriented medial margin and a gently sloping
18
19
267 medioventrally oriented lateral margin. The entire paroccipital process is anteroposteriorly
20
21
22 268 expended compared to the flat, plate-like exoccipital dorsal to it. Ventrally, the paroccipital
23
24 269 process preserves a shallow posterior sinus and, medial to it, a deep jugular notch. This jugular
25
26 270 notch is bound laterally by the posterior sinus and medially by a bulbous expansion of the
27
28
29 271 paroccipital process as it reaches its ventral apex.
30
31 272
32
33 273 4.6. Periotic
34
35
36
274 UWBM 50004 preserves a complete right periotic in situ (figure. 6). The periotic is
37
38 275 visible in ventral and medial views, and part of the superior process is visible in dorsal view
39
40 276 through the braincase. In ventral view the anterior process is transversely thin and blade-like, and
41
42
277 is oriented with a slight medial deflection. It is tightly appressed against the squamosal laterally.
43
44
45 278 The cochlear portion of the periotic is anteroposteriorly elongate and inflated medially. The
46
47 279 anterior margin of the cochlear process slopes gently anteriorly so that the transition between the
48
49 280 cochlear process and the anterior process is smooth and gradual. In contrast, the posterior margin
50
51
52 281 of the cochlear process is posteriorly convex so that the transition between the cochlear process
53
54 282 and the posterior process is sharp and abrupt. These margins serve to give the cochlear process

2
3 283 an overall teardrop or pear shape, being broad and inflated posteriorly with a gradually tapering
4
5
6 284 anterior end. The posterior process of the periotic is deflected posterolaterally off the sagittal
7
8 285 plane. It terminates at a blunt, rounded posterior apex. A posterior bullar facet is not preserved.
9
10 286 The foramen ovale is dorsoventrally deep and is positioned in the posterior half of the
11
12
13
287 cochlear process. It preserves a well-defined, rounded anterior margin but a poorly defined, open
14
15 288 posterior margin. Preserved within the foramen ovale is the rod-shaped stapes. Anterolateral to
16
17 289 the foramen ovale is the mallear fossa, which preserves as a shallow pit medial to the lateral
18
19
290 tuberosity. The lateral tuberosity can be identified lateral to the mallear fossa but is
20
21
22 291 predominantly obscured by the squamosal where it occludes with the periotic.
23
24 292 In medial view the anterior process is oriented anteroposteriorly. It preserves a squared
25
26 293 off anterior tip with only a very faint dorsal apex. The dorsal margin is relatively flat as it
27
28
29 294 transitions from the anterior process onto the superior process. The ventral margin bears a slight
30
31 295 ventral convexity, being gently rounded ventrally at the anterior process and recessed dorsally as
32
33 296 it transitions to the cochlear portion. The posterior process is angled posteroventrally at a 45°
34
35
36 297 angle, creating a sharp demarcation between the cochlear and posterior processes. In medial
37
38 298 view, much of the posterior process is eclipsed by the paroccipital process of the exoccipital.
39
40 299 The fenestra rotunda is situated on the posterior surface of the cochlear process and
41
42
43 300 orients posteromedially. It is oval in shape, being slightly longer anteroposteriorly than
44
45 301 dorsoventrally, and preserves several distinct ridges running from its dorsal margin. The aperture
46
47 302 for the vestibular aqueduct and the aperture for the cochlear aqueduct are visible on the dorsal
48
49
303 surface of the cochlear process and are confluent, appearing as a single, transversely elongated
50
51
52 304 foramen. Together, the apertures are deep and run nearly the entire transverse width of cochlear
53
54 305 process in dorsal view.

2
3 306 In dorsal view, only a small portion of the anterior process is visible. Instead, most of the
4
5
6 307 dorsal exposure of the periotic is the suprameatal fossa, which preserves as a deep basin bound
7
8 308 laterally by the lateral margin of the superior process and medially by the internal acoustic
9
10 309 meatus. The internal acoustic meatus preserves as two distinct openings: a roughly circular
11
12
13
310 shaped endocranial opening for the facial canal and an elongated, oval shaped spiral cribiform
14
15 311 tract. These two openings are separated by a high crista transversa that is angled posteriorly so
16
17 312 that the foramen singulare is obscured in dorsal view.
18
19
313
20
21
22 314 4.7. Tympanic Bulla
23
24 315 UWBM 50004 preserves a nearly complete right tympanic bulla (figure. 7), though the
25
26 316 dorsal margin shows some distortion and diagenetic alteration. In dorsal view the later margin of
27
28
29 317 the outer lip is sigmoidal, being convex posteriorly, deeply concave at its midpoint, and convex
30
31 318 again anteriorly. The sigmoid process is situated near the posterior margin, completely posterior
32
33 319 to the tympanic cavity, and is crushed so that it lies on top of and obscuring the conical process.
34
35
36
320 The sigmoid process preserves as a tubular, transversely oriented cylinder. Damage in this region
37
38 321 obscures the mallear ridge. The outer posterior pedicle lies posterior to the flattened sigmoid
39
40 322 process and appears low and blunt. The broken malleus lies crushed medial and anterior to the
41
42
323 sigmoid process. Posteriorly, the inner and outer posterior pedicles are well developed and
43
44
45 324 separated by a deep elliptical foramen. Medially, the involucral ridge demarcates the medial
46
47 325 margin of the bulla and continues to the anterior margin. The dorsal surface of the involucrum is
48
49 326 smooth and sloping ventromedially away from the tympanic cavity. Anteriorly, the medial
50
51
52 327 margin of the bulla turns in at a 45° angle to create a bluntly rounded anterior margin of the
53
54 328 tympanic bulla.

1
2
3 329 In medial view the overall ventral margin of the bulla is gently convex, slopping dorsally
4
5
6 330 towards its anterior end. The dorsal margin is stepped, being convex and pronounced to a level
7
8 331 just anterior to the sigmoid process and then slopes sharply towards the anterior end. The lateral
9
10 332 lobe extends further posteriorly than the medial lobe so that the well-developed median furrow is
11
12
13
333 visible in medial view. The lateral lobe bears a globular, convex posterior margin while the
14
15 334 medial lobe preserves a flat, dorsoventrally oriented posterior margin. In lateral view, the
16
17 335 posterior margin of the lateral lobe is visible as a sharp ridge extending down from the conical
18
19
336 process. Anterior to the broken mallear ridge begins a lateral furrow that runs ventrally across the
20
21
22 337 lateral surface, but is shallow compared to the deeper lateral furrow of Fucaia buelli. This lateral
23
24 338 furrow divides the lateral surface of the bulla into two distinct regions: a posterior region that is
25
26 339 ovoid in shape, and an anterior region that is more triangular in shape as it tapers to a point at the
27
28
29 340 anterior margin of the bulla.
30
31 341 In ventral view the bulla preserves a relatively straight, anteroposteriorly oriented medial
32
33 342 margin and a gently curved, convex lateral margin. The posterior portion of the ventral surface
34
35
36
343 bears a deep interpromontorial notch separating the medial and lateral lobes. The
37
38 344 interpromontorial notch is deep, but short, and does not approach the level of the lateral furrow.
39
40 345 In posterior view the outer posterior prominence is transversely thin compared to the
41
42
346 inner posterior prominence. The interpromontorial notch is deep and oriented dorsoventrally. At
43
44
45 347 the ventral margin, the medial lobe bears a transverse crest running from the interpromontorial
46
47 348 notch around to the medial surface of the bulla. The inner posterior pedicle is faintly visible at
48
49 349 the dorsal margin of the inner posterior prominence. The outer posterior pedicle is visible just
50
51
52 350 posterior to the sigmoid process, which has been compressed down over the conical process,
53
54 351 elliptical foramen, and other underlying features.

6 353 4.8. Auditory Ossicles
7
8 354 The right malleus is in situ and is compacted between the collapsed mallear ridge and
9
10 355 sigmoid process of the tympanic bulla. The anterior process of the malleus is broken and
11
12
13
356 missing, but the main body is present. It is robust, anteroposteriorly elongated, and tightly
14
15 357 appressed to the sigmoid process as its posterior margin.
16
17 358 The right incus is preserved in isolation from the other ear bones. It is somewhat
18
19
359 damaged where it articulated with the malleus, obscuring the morphology around the
20
21
22 360 incudomallear joint. However, the body of the incus is well preserved. The crus breve is notably
23
24 361 short and pointed at its apex, but appears to the complete based on its tight articulation with the
25
26 362 fossa incudis in the periotic. The crus longum is indistinct from the body of the incus, and the
27
28
29 363 lenticular process cannot be distinguished.
30
31 364 The right stapes is preserved in situ within the fenestra ovale. It is narrow in diameter and
32
33 365 is angled posteriorly as it exits the foramen ovale. The distal head of the stapes is slightly
34
35
36
366 inflamed so that it is broader in diameter than the body of the stapes.
37

39
40 368 4.9. Mandible and Dentition
41
42
369 UWBM 50004 presents an unusual opportunity to understand the morphology of the
43
44
45 370 mandible and lower dentition of aetiocetids. It preserves elements of both the left and right
46
47 371 mandibles (figure. 8), allowing for a reconstruction of the complete dental morphology. Each
48
49 372 dentary is described separately herein.
50
51
52 373 The right mandible of UWBM 50004 is represented solely by an anterior fragment,
53
54 374 preserving its distal tip. This fragment preserves alveoli for 7 teeth, with the two posteriormost

3 375 teeth preserved in situ. Because the cheek teeth of cetaceans are difficult to differentiate, we
4
5
6 376 conservatively label these first seven teeth as three incisors, one canine, and three postcanine
7
8 377 teeth.
9
10 378 In lateral view, the right mandible, which is incomplete, preserves a spear shaped
11
12
13
379 anterior margin terminating in a point at about the center of the height of the mandible. This
14
15 380 morphology differs from Aetiocetus weltoni, which has an anterior termination nearly at the
16
17 381 dorsal margin of the mandible. Superficially, only two mental foramina are visible on the right
18
19
382 fragment; however, internal morphology revealed via CT scans indicate that five mental
20

22 383 foramina are preserved in this part of the mandible; including the left fragment, the entire
23
24 384 mandible may possess as many as 9 mental foramina total. In medial view, the distal tip
25
26 385 preserves a symphyseal groove extending 6 cm from the distal tip to a level just anterior to the
27
28
29 386 canine.
30
31 387 At the distal margin, between the first incisor and the first postcanine, the ventral surface
32
33 388 is transversely thinner than the dorsal surface, which widens to accommodate the alveoli. The
34
35
36
389 result is a transversely thin cross section that narrows ventrally. Posterior to the first postcanine
37
38 390 tooth, the ventral margin expands transversely and becomes more rounded, creating a more ovate
39
40 391 cross section.
41
42
392 The alveolus for the first incisor is positioned at the extreme distal tip and opens with a
43
44
45 393 strong anterior inclination, suggesting a procumbent first incisor. Each subsequent alveolus is
46
47 394 increasingly oriented dorsally so that, overall, the three incisors exhibit notable anterior
48
49 395 inclination, the canine only very slight anterior inclination, and the post canine teeth no anterior
50
51
52 396 inclination at all. All first five alveoli are extremely deep and penetrate down to the level of the
53
54 397 mandibular canal. The alveoli of the right fragment indicate that the three incisors and the canine

1
2
3 398 are all single rooted. Only a single alveolus for the first post canine tooth is visible, but it is
4
5
6 399 anteroposteriorly expanded, suggesting two fused roots in a single alveolus lacking an isthmus.
7
8 400 The second and third postcanine teeth, which are preserved in situ, expose enough of the root
9
10 401 above the dorsal margin of the mandible to confirm the teeth as double rooted. The dorsal margin
11
12
13
402 of the right dentary preserves embrasure pits between the first and second, and between the
14
15 403 second and third post canine teeth.
16
17 404 The second postcanine tooth is triangular in shape, with a crown measuring 10 mm across
18
19
405 at its base and 11 mm from the base to the apex. In addition to the central cusp, it bears a single
20
21
22 406 accessory cusp on both the anterior and the posterior sides. In anterior view, all three cusps bear
23
24 407 a slight lingual curvature. The lingual surface of the tooth preserves a notable shelf of enamel
25
26 408 above the crown line. The labial surface of the tooth preserves no such shelf. Both the labial and
27
28
29 409 lingual surfaces preserve dorsoventral striations running from the base of the crown to the apex.
30
31 410 The third post canine tooth is similar in shape but is larger overall, with a crown
32
33 411 measuring 14 mm wide at the base and 13 mm tall. As the preceding tooth, the third postcanine
34
35
36
412 tooth preserves a single anterior accessory cusp. However, unlike the preceding tooth, it
37
38 413 preserves three posterior accessory cusps. These three accessory cusps become increasingly large
39
40 414 moving towards the main, central cusp. As with the preceding tooth, all the cusps bear a slight
41
42
415 lingual inclination. Similar to the preceding tooth, a shelf of enamel above the crown line
43
44
45 416 preserves only on the lingual surface, and both the labial and lingual surfaces preserve
46
47 417 dorsoventral striations. Both of these teeth preserve wear on the posterior margin, with the
48
49 418 posterior accessory cusps being notably worn.
50
51
52 419 The left mandible is especially informative because all of its alveoli preserve teeth. The
53
54 420 anteriormost portion of the left dentary preserved begins at the level of the second postcanine
55
56

2
3 421 tooth. Here, a break in the dentary exposes the roots of the second postcanine tooth, confirming
4
5
6 422 that it is double rooted. The left dentary is complete posterior to this point until its termination
7
8 423 just anterior to the coronoid process and the mandibular foramen. The coronoid process, angular
9
10 424 process, and articular condyle are all missing. The seventh postcanine tooth was removed during
11
12
13
425 preparation and molding, but it easily articulates into its original position in the alveolus. The left
14
15 426 mandible fragment preserves the nine most proximal teeth, which represent the second through
16
17 427 tenth postcanine teeth.
18
19
428 In lateral view, the left mandible preserves four mental foramina at the following levels:
20
21
22 429 at the third post canine tooth, anterior and posterior to the fifth post canine tooth, and at the
23
24 430 seventh post canine tooth. CT data corroborates the external interpretation of four mental
25
26 431 foramina. The sulci range in length from 12–37 mm, and in thickness by 1–2 mm. In medial
27
28
29 432 view the dorsal and ventral margins are parallel until the level of the fifth postcanine tooth. At
30
31 433 this level, the dorsal margin deflects dorsally so that the fifth through tenth postcanine teeth are
32
33 434 increasingly dorsally elevated. This dorsal deflection continues posterior to the final tooth and
34
35
36
435 rises to the broken coronoid process. At its proximal termination, the left mandible preserves just
37
38 436 to the anterior margin of the mandibular foramen, suggesting that the mandibular foramen was
39
40 437 broadly rounded at its anterior termination and dorsoventrally expanded. This expanded
41
42
438 mandibular foramen is typical of stem cetaceans, odontocetes, and stem mysticetes, but differs
43
44
45 439 from crown mysticetes [27, 28].
46
47 440 At its distal end, the left mandible is ovate in cross section as the right mandible at the
48
49 441 same level. Moving proximally, the dorsal margin narrows, especially posterior to the tenth and
50
51
52 442 final postcanine tooth, resulting in a transversely narrowed cross section at the proximal end,
53
54 443 which is reflected in the morphology at the level of the broken coronoid process.

2
3 444 All teeth preserved in the left mandible (postcanine teeth 2–10) are double rooted and
4
5
6 445 oriented dorsally, but bear a similar lingual deflection to those of the right fragment. Moving
7
8 446 proximally, there is increasingly less space between teeth, so that the distance between the
9
10 447 second and third postcanine teeth measures 16 mm but the distance between the ninth and tenth
11
12
13
448 post canine teeth measures only 2 mm. Accordingly, embrasure pits are preserved between the
14
15 449 second and third, third and fourth, fourth and fifth, and perhaps fifth and sixth postcanine teeth.
16
17 450 Posterior to this level, the teeth are spaced too close together to accommodate the upper
18
19
451 dentition, and no embrasure pits are present.
20
21
22 452 As with the right dentary, the postcanine teeth preserved in the left mandible are
23
24 453 triangular in shape overall. The second postcanine tooth (which is the first tooth preserved in the
25
26 454 series) preserves a single, small accessory cusp on both the anterior and posterior sides of the
27
28
29 455 main, central cusp. The third and fourth postcanine teeth each preserve a single anterior
30
31 456 accessory cusp and three posterior accessory cusps. The fifth postcanine tooth preserves a single
32
33 457 anterior accessory cusp and four posterior accessory cusps. The sixth and seventh postcanine
34
35
36
458 teeth each preserve two anterior accessory cusps and four posterior accessory cusps. The eight
37
38 459 through tenth postcanine teeth are each damaged on their anterior margins but are consistent in
39
40 460 overall shape and appearance with the two preceding teeth. Each of these latter teeth preserves
41
42
461 four posterior accessory cusps and we consider it likely that they also preserved two anterior
43
44
45 462 accessory cusps prior to wear, in life. The teeth in the left mandible increase in size posteriorly,
46
47 463 peaking with the seventh postcanine tooth, and then diminishing posterior in the sequence. All of
48
49 464 teeth preserve the lingual shelf of enamel noted in the teeth of the right dentary, and no such
50
51
52 465 structure exists on the labial surface. Similar to the right fragment, all of the teeth bear the
53
54 466 dorsoventral striations on both the lingual and labial faces of the enamel. Post canine teeth two
55
56
57
58
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 22 of 48
1
2
3 467 and three preserve little to no wear of the enamel, teeth four through seven preserve the heaviest
4
5
6 468 wear on the posterior margins, and teeth eight through ten preserve the heaviest wear on the
7
8 469 anterior margins. In each case, wear is heaviest on the accessory cusps and wear to the central
9
10 470 cusp is minimal or nonexistent.
11
12
13
471 In addition to the teeth preserved in the dentaries, three teeth were recovered in isolation
14
15 472 and are here described separately. The first is tentatively identified as the left, lower first post
16
17 473 canine tooth. Overall it is similar in appearance to the second postcanine tooth on the left side,
18
19
474 though it is slightly smaller. It also preserves a single accessory cusp on both the anterior and
20
21
22 475 posterior sides, and preserves little or no wear on the enamel. It too preserves a lingual shelf of
23
24 476 enamel, though it is much less pronounced than that seen in any of the previously described post
25
26 477 canine teeth. Similarly, it preserves both lingual and labial dorsoventral striations, though they
27
28
29 478 are less elaborate, particularly on the labial side, than in the previously described post canine
30
31 479 teeth. Although it is double rooted, the roots are tightly fused and appear confluent; this is
32
33 480 consistent with the right fragment which preserves only a single, expanded alveolus for the first
34
35
36
481 post canine tooth.
37
38 482 The second isolated tooth is tentatively identified here as the lower left third incisor. This
39
40 483 tooth is incisiform in overall shape, being much more conical and less triangular than the
41
42
484 previously described cheek teeth. No accessory cusps are present and the single, main cusp is
43
44
45 485 much taller overall compared to its anteroposterior width. As with the other teeth described, this
46
47 486 tooth bears a lingual deflection at its apex, and dorsoventral striations across the enamel. Unlike
48
49 487 the other described teeth, no enamel shelf is present on the lingual surface. Though its position as
50
51
52 488 the third incisor is tentative, its assignment to the left dentary is bolstered by the fact that it does
53
54 489 not fit any of the preserved alveoli in the right dentary. This tooth is also unique in that it

2
3 490 preserves a complete root, which measures 45 mm in length compared to the 19 mm length of
4
5
6 491 the crown.
7
8 492 The third and final isolated tooth is tentatively identified here as the lower right canine.
9
10 493 This tooth is conical and incisiform in shape, preserves little wear, and no lingual enamel shelf.
11
12
13
494 As with the other described teeth, a lingual inflection at the apex is present, though less so than
14
15 495 with the other described teeth. Both labial and lingual striations are present, though are much
16
17 496 more pronounced on the lingual surface. The tooth preserves a single, complete root, which
18
19
497 measures 40 mm in length compared to the 18 mm long crown.
20
21
22 498
23
24 499 4.10. Vertebrae
25
26 500 A complete vertebra belonging to UWBM 50004 is preserved and here interpreted as
27
28
29 501 either the first or second thoracic vertebra. The centrum is oval in overall shape, being slightly
30
31 502 transversely wider than dorsoventrally tall. In cranial view, the dorsal margin of the centrum is
32
33 503 flat and transversely oriented so that the neural canal has a flat ventral margin. The neural arch
34
35
36
504 sits low, with a blunted apex so that the neural canal rises to only a modest apex at its dorsal
37
38 505 margin. The neural canal echoes the centrum in being transversely wider than dorsoventrally tall.
39
40 506 Overall it is vaguely pear-shaped with its transverse widening, flat ventral margin, and blunt
41
42
507 apex at its dorsal margin.
43
44
45 508 The right transverse process is badly broken, but the left is complete. The left transverse
46
47 509 process is flattened dorsoventrally and broad anteroposteriorly, so that its anterior margin
48
49 510 terminates in a flat, sharp, blade. At its distal tip, the left transverse process expands into a
50
51
52 511 swollen knob. In cranial view, the transverse processes extend dorsolaterally from the transverse
53
54 512 plane at a 45° angle. In cranial view the neural spine begins at the dorsal margin of the neural
55
56
57
58
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 24 of 48
1
2
3 513 canal. It bears a sharp, blade-like keel at its anterior face. Its lateral margins extend
4
5
6 514 posterolaterally from this keel so that its total transverse width expands posteriorly. The dorsal
7
8 515 apex of the neural spine is not preserved.
9
10 516 In lateral view, the centrum is positioned directly beneath the neural spine, which is
11
12
13
517 similar in anteroposterior length as the centrum. What is preserved of the neural spine is directed
14
15 518 dorsally with no evidence for a posterior deflection as seen in the neural spines of Dorudon. The
16
17 519 transverse processes bear a notable anterior deflection so that their distal terminations are well
18
19
520 anterior to the centrum, where they would have articulated with the anterior vertebra. The
20
21
22 521 intervertebral foramen is anteroposteriorly deep and dorsoventrally tall, with a rounded anterior
23
24 522 margin so that it is overall C-shaped. The left transverse process preserves a facet for the
25
26 523 tuberculum of a rib. The posterior margin of the lateral borders of the centrum each preserve a
27
28
29 524 demifacet for the capitulum of a rib. The lateral margins of the centrum are anteroposteriorly
30
31 525 concave, so that the centrum is transversely broadest at its anterior and posterior margins and
32
33 526 narrower in the middle, giving it an hourglass shape. The postzyapophysis extends posteriorly
34
35
36
527 from the neural arch and roofs the intervertebral foramen. In lateral view it bears a slight
37
38 528 posterodorsal angle.
39
40 529 In caudal view the posterior face of the neural arch and the neural spine bear deep
41
42
530 concavities. This results in lateral margins that extend posteriorly beyond medial portions that
43
44
45 531 preserve as deep valleys in the posterior face of the neural arch and neural spine. This
46
47 532 morphology is likely to accommodate the sharp, expanded blade-like keep preserved on the
48
49 533 anterior margin of the neural spine.
50
51
52 534 A poorly preserved transverse process and minimal portion of a centrum, as well as
53
54 535 several other isolated vertebral elements belonging to UWBM 50004 are also preserved.

10 539 4.11. Ontogeny and Body Size
11
12
13
540 Skeletal maturity was assessed based on established osteological indicators such as the
14
15 541 fusion of cranial sutures and textural surface of the occipital condyles [29]. UWBM preserves
16
17 542 clearly distinguishable, closed sutures, with one exception: the exoccipital-squamosal suture,
18
19
543 which preserves some separation. However, this suture is also broadly open for some length in
20
21
22 544 Aetiocetus cotylalveus. Thus, it is unclear whether this condition is an ontogenetic trait unique to
23
24 545 Salishicetus meadi of perhaps is broadly observed in aetiocetids. The occipital condyles are
25
26 546 entirely smooth and devoid of any pitting typically indicative of an early ontogenetic age. Based
27
28
29 547 on this morphology, we interpret UWBM 50004 as belonging to an osteologically mature
30
31 548 individual.
32
33 549 We used the stem mysticete body size equation for bizygomatic width from Pyenson and
34
35
36
550 Sponberg [29] to estimate the total body length of Salishicetus meadi. Based on this data using a
37
38 551 bizygomatic width of 32.6 cm., Salishicetus meadi had an approximate total length of 3 meters.
39
40 552 This method likely underestimates the true value given that the right zygomatic process is not
41
42
553 complete and appears to have continued to flare laterally. Nevertheless, this value is
43
44
45 554 approximately ten percent larger than Pyenson and Sponberg [29] estimated for Aetiocetus
46
47 555 cotylalveus using bizygomatic width.

2
3 559 Several overlapping morphological features shared by both the right and left dentaries of
4
5
6 560 UWBM 50004 facilitate a reconstruction of the complete dental row (figure. 9). The first and
7
8 561 second postcanine teeth on the right fragment match the anteriormost teeth on the left incomplete
9
10 562 mandible in both anteroposterior crown lengths and crown heights. In general, the first two post-
11
12
13
563 canine teeth are smaller than the subsequent postcanine teeth. The anteriormost postcanine tooth
14
15 564 on the left mandible preserves a single anterior and posterior accessory cusp, as does the second
16
17 565 post canine tooth in the right fragment. Similarly, the subsequent tooth on the left mandible
18
19
566 preserves a single anterior accessory cusp and three posterior accessory cusps; the same
20
21
22 567 morphology is observed in the right third post canine tooth. Similarly, these teeth are consistent
23
24 568 in number of roots and overall size across both mandibles.
25
26 569 In addition to these dental similarities, the shape of the mandibles in transverse section
27
28
29 570 through the levels of the second and third postcanine teeth are similar in preserving a flat labial
30
31 571 surface and a concave lingual surface, further implying homology of these regions. Thus, the
32
33 572 overall morphology across the two mandibles strongly suggests that the left mandible begins
34
35
36
573 with the second postcanine tooth, implying that Salishicetus meadi preserved ten post canine
37
38 574 teeth in total.
39
40 575 Three isolated teeth were found in association with UWBM 50004. The first tooth
41
42
576 preserves a crown with edged, small accessory cusps (one anterior and one posterior). This tooth
43
44
45 577 is double rooted, though the two roots are tightly appressed and fused. Given these
46
47 578 characteristics, this tooth is likely a first post canine tooth. Its curvature and sidedness imply
48
49 579 either a lower left or upper right first postcanine tooth, though neither can be falsified as no
50
51
52 580 alveoli are present in these quadrants.

2
3 581 The other two isolated teeth preserve long, thin roots that taper and curve dramatically.
4
5
6 582 These teeth preserve crowns that are smooth on the labial side and exhibit longitudinal striations
7
8 583 on the lingual side. Given this morphology, these teeth likely represent incisors or a potential
9
10 584 canine. One of the two is here interpreted as the lower left third incisor given that the curvature
11
12
13
585 of its root matches the alveolus for the third incisor on the right dentary; however, its sidedness
14
15 586 precludes it from belonging to the right tooth row. The other of the two is interpreted as the
16
17 587 lower right canine for similar reasons. Though it cannot be asserted with certainty, the tooth in
18
19
588 question occludes comfortably in the alveolus for the canine in the right dentary and the overall
20
21
22 589 crown shape is consistent with the morphological patterns observed in the second and third post
23
24 590 canine teeth.

29 592 5.2. Monophyly of Aetiocetidae
30
31 593 Our analysis (figure. 10) differs from previous results using this matrix [17, 18, 30] in
32
33 594 recovering a monophyletic Aetiocetidae, and is consistent with previous results in resolving the
34
35
36
595 Mammalodontidae as a separate clade, basal to Aetiocetidae, unlike results from other matrices
37
38 596 [7, 11, 16]. Here, a monophyletic Aetiocetidae is united by the following synapomorphies:
39
40 597 anterior edge of the nasals just anterior to or at the level of the anterior edge of the supraorbital
41
42
598 process; lacking a postorbital ridge of the frontal; lacking longitudinal grooves on the posterior
43
44
45 599 bullar facet of the periotic; dorsoventrally deepest part of the anterior process of the periotic
46
47 600 lying within the posterior 50% of the anterior process; aperture for the vestibular aqueduct
48
49 601 transversely wider than the opening of the facial canal; posteriormost upper tooth anterior to the
50
51
52 602 antorbital notch; and a straight radius lacking anterior curvature.

5
6 604 Three of the four species of Aetiocetus form a well-supported clade (recovered in 100% of our
7

9
10 606 sister to a clade formed by Chonecetus sookensis and Morawanocetus yabukii (a result that was
11
12
13
607 also recovered in 100% of best score trees). Accordingly, we consider Aetiocetus tomitai and
14
15 608 Morawanocetus yabukii (both from the late Oligocene of Hokkaido, Japan) to belong to
16
17 609 Chonecetus along with Chonecetus sookensis (from the late Oligocene of British Columbia,
18
19

22 611 and Chonecetus yabukii (nov. comb.). It is worth noting, however, that these taxonomic
23
24 612 decisions rest on material with limited comparability within Aetiocetidae: Chonecetus sookensis
25
26 613 preserves only 90 of the 363 characters (24.8%) in this matrix—the type and only known
27
28
29 614 specimen consists of an incomplete cranium with a single left periotic in situ. Nevertheless,
30
31 615 removing Chonecetus sookensis from the analysis results in nearly the same consensus tree, with
32
33 616 the slight difference that presents C. yabukii and C. tomitai as sister taxa.
34
35
36
617 Given this taxonomic revision, our analysis returns three distinct subclades within
37
38 618 Aetiocetidae: (1) a monophyletic Aetiocetus (100% of best score trees); (2) a clade of Fucaia
39
40 619 spp. + Chonecetus spp. (85% of best score trees); and (3) a single lineage representing
41
42
620 Salishicetus meadi (100% of best score trees). UWBM 82941 resolves as basal to the clade of
43
44
45 621 Fucaia spp. and UWBM 87135 resolves as basal to the clade of Chonecetus spp. Salishicetus is
46
47 622 resolved in polytomy with these other sub-clades within Aetiocetidae, which reflects the unique
48
49 623 characters that distinguish it from other aetiocetids such as the strongly heterodont cheek teeth
50
51
52 624 with elaborate accessory cusps.

3 626 5.3. Feeding Morphologies and the Evolution of Filter Feeding
4
5
6 627 The position of aetiocetids in mysticete phylogeny has led to their interpretation as that
7
8 628 they represent intermediate forms between macrophagous raptorial predators (i.e., the ancestral
9
10 629 condition represented in basilosaurid cetaceans) and bulk filter feeders (as seen in living
11
12
13
630 mysticetes). Understanding the details of this transition from raptorial to filter-feeding along the
14
15 631 lineage leading to living mysticetes requires a thorough study of the diversity in morphological
16
17 632 states among aetiocetids and other stem mysticetes. For example, some aetiocetids exhibit a
18
19
633 simplification of root and cusp count from their ancestral states resulting in dentition similar to
20
21
22 634 that of homodont odontocetes [3]. Other aetiocetids preserve palatal foramina that have been
23
24 635 interpreted as proxies for proto-baleen [12]. Most recently Marx et al. [13] described an unnamed
25
26 636 aetiocetid with dental wear indicative of suction feeding. However, none of the observed
27
28
29 637 morphologies are consistent across all aetiocetids; aetiocetid morphology bears only on
30
31 638 inferences about the evolution and origin of filter feeding in mysticetes if we can accurately
32
33 639 resolve the ancestral condition for the clade. Otherwise, any specialization might represent a
34
35
36
640 uniquely derived character state. It is therefore worth considering each aspect in more detail.
37
38 641
39
40 642 5.3.1. Dental Simplification
41
42
643 Species of Aetiocetus exhibit a simplified dentition with single rooted cheek teeth and
43
44
45 644 greatly diminished accessory cusps–so much so that they were originally described as homodont
46
47 645 by Barnes et al. [3], though we agree with Deméré and Berta [8] that “weakly heterodont” is a
48
49 646 more appropriate classification. However, other aetiocetids such as Chonecetus yabukii, and
50
51
52 647 Fucaia buelli preserve double rooted cheek teeth with larger and more elaborate cusps and likely
53
54 648 used the dentition for shearing and prey processing [11].

2
3 649 Salishicetus meadi is the most strongly heterodont aetiocetid known; the cheek teeth are
4
5
6 650 substantially larger overall those of Fucaia buelli, and bear notably taller crowns. Though no
7
8 651 upper dentition is preserved, the extensive wear on the cheek teeth, especially on the accessory
9
10 652 cusps, as well as the deep embrasure pits on both dentaries, suggest a tight occlusion for
11
12
13
653 shearing. Because this feeding morphology is observed in more basal mysticetes [10, 31], and in
14
15 654 three distinct genera of aetiocetids (Salishicetus, Chonecetus, and Fucaia), we consider it the
16
17 655 most likely ancestral condition. Therefore, we consider the dental simplification of Aetiocetus
18
19
656 spp. a derived trait unrelated to the loss of dentition in crown Mysticeti.
20
21
22 657
23
24 658 5.3.2. Suction Feeding
25
26 659 Recently, an undescribed aetiocetid (NMV P252567) exhibiting dental wear associated
27
28
29 660 with suction feeding has led to the hypothesis that suction feeding preceded filter feeding [13].
30
31 661 However, the implications of this feeding morphology are difficult to interpret. The earliest
32
33 662 known mysticete, Mystacodon selenensis, also exhibits evidence of suction feeding [10]. Thus, at
34
35
36
663 least three distinct lineages of toothed mysticetes are thought to have been suction feeders
37
38 664 (Mystacodon selenensis, Mammalodon colliveri, and NMB P252567).
39
40 665 We do not disagree with any of the above authors in their interpretation of suction
41
42
666 feeding for the respective taxa. However, it is well established that both raptorial feeders and
43
44
45 667 bulk feeders employ some degree of suction during the feeding cycle [1, 2, 32], suggesting that
46
47 668 the use of suction is likely ancestral in crown Cetacea. It is therefore critical to distinguish
48
49 669 between raptorial feeders capable of producing suction and true suction specialists.
50
51
52 670 Interpreting suction feeding as the ancestral condition for aetiocetids based on NMV
53
54 671 P252567 is problematic as the dental wear indicative of suction feeding is not observed in any
55

Page 31 of 48 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 672 other known aetiocetid. Instead, we consider it likely that some degree of suction is ancestral
4
5
6 673 both for crown Cetacea and for stem Mysticeti. However, we consider the morphology of NMV
7
8 674 P252567 a derived condition reflecting a suction specialist.
9
10 675
11
12
13
676 5.3.3. Proto-Baleen
14
15 677 It has been suggested that palatal foramina medial to the tooth alveoli of some aetiocetids
16
17 678 are homologous to baleen innervation and vascularization in extant mysticetes, suggesting the
18
19
679 presence of proto-baleen [8, 12]. Recent authors have questioned the viability of this hypothesis
20
21
22 680 [11, 13, 14]. This hypothesis requires that proto-baleen is the ancestral condition for aetiocetids,
23
24 681 otherwise it represents a homoplastic condition suggesting that baleen evolved twice: within
25
26 682 aetiocetids and again in crown Mysticeti [11]. However, the palatal foramina are present in only
27
28
29 683 three species of aetiocetids (Aetiocetus cotylalveus, A. weltoni, and Fucaia goedertorum).
30
31 684 Moreover, aetiocetids such as Fucaia buelli and Salishicetus meadi preserve evidence of tight
32
33 685 dental occlusion that would have been hindered by proto-baleen [11]. Therefore, the presence of
34
35
36
686 teeth and proto-baleen simultaneously is problematic; this hypothesis is neither the most
37
38 687 parsimonious phylogenetic explanation, nor has it been demonstrated to be biomechanically
39
40 688 viable.

43
44
45 690 5.3.4. The Challenges of Reconstructing Ancestral Feeding Morphologies
46
47 691 The disparity in feeding morphologies across aetiocetids creates challenges with
48
49 692 reconstructing the ancestral condition of any trait leading to crown Mysticeti, in light of this
50
51
52 693 phylogenetic analysis and subsequent taxonomic revision. The “weakly heterodont” dentition of
53
54 694 Aetiocetus is restricted to that genus, suggesting that this simplification is a derived trait
55
56
57
58
59
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 32 of 48
1
2
3 695 unrelated to the evolution of tooth loss. NMV P252567 [13] clearly exhibits morphology
4
5
6 696 specialized for suction, but the absence of this morphology in other aetiocetids suggests that it is
7
8 697 a derived trait. Salishicetus meadi and Fucaia buelli each represent aetiocetids with precise
9
10 698 occlusion incompatible with the spacing needed for putative proto-baleen. This finding, in
11
12
13
699 addition to the questionable homology of palatal foramina relative to palatal sulci housing baleen
14
15 700 in living mysticetes [14] and the unknown feeding biomechanics of a gape cycle using proto-
16
17 701 baleen and teeth [11, 14] make the hypothesis of proto-baleen in aetiocetids dubious.
18
19
702
20
21
22 703 6. Conclusion
23
24 704 In light of this evidence, we consider the most likely ancestral feeding state for
25
26 705 aetiocetids to be suction assisted macrophagous raptorial feeding. This foraging behavior is
27
28
29 706 similar to that of their stem cetacean ancestors [33], other stem mysticetes [31], and likely
30
31 707 reflects the condition ancestral of crown Cetacea [1, 2]. Accordingly, we interpret the simplified
32
33 708 dentition of Aetiocetus spp. and the suction specializations of NMV P252567 as derived
34
35
36
709 conditions specific to their respective lineages and doubt the presence of proto-baleen entirely.
37
38 710 Any alternate interpretation suggests one or more homoplastic characters and is therefore not
39
40 711 parsimonious. Given this interpretation, we suggest that aetiocetid feeding morphologies are
41
42
712 unlikely to shed new light on the evolution of baleen, and suggest that such answers lie closer to
43
44
45 713 crown Mysticeti.

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
viewer 1
arding descriptions, one word that is used repeatedly is “sidedness.” I know precisely what
authors mean by this term, but I can’t recall having ever seen this term before. I expect that
er readers will, like me, understand what is meant, but perhaps the authors—if they cannot
another suitable word—can define this term.
Corrected.
re are a few other awkward turns of phrase (such as “has led to their interpretation as that
y represent,” in line 627), but for the most part the writing is admirably concise and clear. In
51: “confirmed by multiple phylogenetic” what… studies?
Corrected.
o, I heartily agree that “aetiocetid morphology bears only on inferences about the evolution
origin of filter feeding in mysticetes if we can accurately resolve the ancestral condition for
clade” (lines 637-639). Amen to that!
Okay.
eems pretty certain that aetiocetids were “potential intermediate forms” (line 52) between
wn mysticetes and the earliest mysticetes, at least in phylogenetic terms. The (big) question
were they, as is often assumed, functionally intermediate between toothed and edentulous
sticetes, with the ecological consequences (i.e., feeding methods) that go along with this
rphology.
Okay.
h regard to the systematics, I like the renaming/recombination the authors’ analysis has led
m to, including Aetiocetus tomitai and Morawanocetus yabukii as (now) Chonecetus tomitai
C. yabukii. Thus the authors’ “best” tree leads to a now-monophyletic genus Aetiocetus—
ven this revision,” as stated in line 617, although they argue earlier (line 603) that they “do
recover a monophyletic Aetiocetus spp.” This might be confusing to someone who is not
ing attention, but I think the explanation, and the tree diagram (Figure 10) make this clear.
Noted. We have clarified this statement to indicate that Aetiocetus is not
monophyletic based on previous definitions, but our taxonomic revision makes
Aetiocetus monophyletic.
h regard to morphology, I think the authors are on firm ground with the contentions they
ke about dentition and feeding methods. I agree that the teeth of many aetiocetids seem to be
ed… for shearing and prey processing” (line 648), with tight occlusion. The authors make a
d case that dental simplification is a derived trait for Aetiocetus that is “unrelated to the loss
entition in crown Mysticeti” (line 656), and that although some early toothed mysticetes,
uding aetiocetids (and Mammalodon), may have been specialized suction feeders, some
ree of suction is not that unusual or noteworthy because suction is often used for aquatic
aoral transport of grasped prey by raptorial feeders. I am in wholehearted agreement with this
m. It is interesting to read the authors’ thoughts about various specimens, even if (like NMV
2567) they are not the direct subjects of this study.
Okay
ewise the authors’ conclusions about “proto-baleen” and the origins of baleen will likely not
viewed favorably by all experts, but I think the authors make a good case here. I have long
ught that many paleontologists are too enamored of a small number of palatal foramina,
ch can be found in many mammals, as implying the presence of baleen or proto-baleen. I
k this is usually a case of wishful thinking. As a result, I concur that many claims about
to-baleen are “dubious” (line 701). I think the true answers to long-sought questions about the
ins of baleen and bulk filter feeding are to be found among species that—as the authors
ely put it—“lie closer to crown Mysticeti” (line 712) rather than with aetiocetids or other stem
sticetes. I couldn’t agree more.
Okay
I am left with a few questions for the authors. First, the exact wording of the title of the ms
iversity of feeding modes”) seems a bit odd to me, given that the authors are arguing that
re is in fact less diversity than often presumed, with most aetiocetids being raptorial feeders
e from a putative suction-feeding specialist. I understand what the authors mean by this
—and they certainly discuss various proposed feeding methods for aetiocetids—but in fact
y conclude that raptorial feeding dominates, with less diversity than other researchers have
posed. I am not lobbying for a title change, but it seems a bit confusing or inaccurate relative
he conclusions they reach.
Corrected. Title has been changed to more accurately reflect the arguments herein.
erms of this feeding diversity, some researchers have argued that palatal foramina relate not
essarily to baleen or proto-baleen but instead to extensive gingival tissue that might aid in
ating an oral seal for suction, or perhaps better grasping of prey. Can the authors comment on
?
Whether proto-baleen or gingival tissue, both structures are soft tissue and lack
osteological correlates. Accordingly, we prefer not to speculate on their
presence/absence.
ch of the authors’ functional analysis is based on the dentition of Salishicetus. There is also a
y extensive description of the mandible. Do other bony features (vertebrae, bullae, palate,
) offer any evidence with regard to feeding methods?
Unfortunately, Salishicetus does not preserve any rostral material that can inform
more about the feeding modes. The rest of the material in question is useful for
placing Salishicetus in phylogenetic context, and subsequently reconstructing
ancestral states.
onder if the authors can say anything about Sitsqwayk, which—although surrounded by many
stions—is an intriguing specimen. Aside from fitting somewhere within stem mysticetes,
ly somewhere between aetiocetids and chaeomysticetes, is there anything else relevant here?
Sitsqwayk does not preserve sufficient morphology to speculate on its role in feeding
transitions. Unpublished USNM material at the USNM under current study will
bear on this topic in the future.
ally, in terms of body size, I think the authors’ estimate for Salishicetus (of approximately 3m
l body length) seems reasonable, but aetiocetids had a fairly wide range of body length (up
I think, nearly 8-10m). Does this have impact on feeding diversity within this family?
While Tsai and Ando (2015) reported a large bodied aetiocetid, all other known
aetiocetids are small bodied (3–4 meters). The large bodied aetiocetid in question
has not been compared to other large Oligocene mysticetes such as Sitsqwayk, and
has not been coded into a phylogenetic analysis. Moreover, the specimen described
by Tsai and Ando (2015) does not preserve any feeding morphology. Until more
material is recovered, it is not worth commenting on the paleobiology of potential
large bodied aetiocetids.

iagnosis of the new species Salishicetus meadi: First, it would be useful if the authors
ude in their diagnosis the combination of characters (derived and primitive) that diagnose the
e specimen of Salishicetus as an aetiocetid. Secondly, 2 of the characters used to diagnose
BM 50004 as a new species are based on the morphology of the anterior end of the
ndible. However, the apex of the mandible looks broken to me. Could it be that the
posedly diagnostic morphology of the apex of the mandible in UWBM 50004 reflects
omplete fossil preservation rather than real autapomorphy? If the interpretation that the
ndible is broken anteriorly is more likely than weird morphology, what are the implications
how diagnostic UWBM 50004 is as a holotype? The third nominal diagnostic character
ting to parallel striae/ridges on the pars cochlearis, dorsal to the fenestra rotunda, sounds
sonable, but they are not especially clear (nor labeled) in the figures supplied. I note here that
y similar-looking structures occur in the periotic of an undescribed mammalodontid from
stralia (NMV P48794), which is figured in Fitzgerald (2010. ZJLS), but I have not seen such
ures in any other toothed mysticete periotic (excluding UWBM 50004). In sum, I encourage
authors to reconsider and rewrite their diagnosis of Salishicetus so that there is more detail on
at features make this specimen distinct and diagnosable from previously described taxa.
The synapomorphies that unite all aetiocetids in this analysis (including
Salishicetus) are listed in the first paragraph of section 5.2 (line 597). They were not
included in the diagnosis for brevity, as well as to avoid confusing diagnostic
characters from previous analyses with those resolved from our own analysis.
Instead, we include our emended diagnosis of Aetiocetidae in the discussion of intra-
familial relationships.
The anterior end of the mandible is not broken or damaged; we consider this
morphology to be complete and accurately preserved. We emphasize the similarity
to the mandible of A. weltoni, which is complete at the distal margin.
We have illustrated these striae on the pars cochlearis as requested and noted their
presence in the text as request.
ome of the issues raised above are compounded by the less-than-optimal illustration of key
tomical regions of UWBM 50004, which made it difficult for me to independently evaluate
ain identifications of morphology and comparisons between taxa/specimens. While the 3D
dels are nice in aiding interpretation of specimens (the reconstruction of the mandible from
mmetrically preserved left and right sides is brilliant), I think it is vital to illustrate the
inal fossil specimens, especially when describing a new taxon. The 3D models of the
panic bulla, mandibles + dentition are simply no replacement for some macro-photographs of
original elements. The apparently complete thoracic vertebra and incus are not illustrated in
res, meaning I can't evaluate the description of these preserved elements. Ideally, the periotic
urrounding auditory region of the basicranium; tympanic bulla; and teeth should be whitened
h ammonium chloride and photographed in close-up detail using a macro lens. I realise that
lities for ammonium chloride coating of specimens are not available everywhere, but if at all
sible it would be very useful to other specialists in the field if UWBM 50004 were
tographed and illustrated using this technique. This is especially the case here where the ear
es, dentition and possibly mandible, are the most diagnostic preserved elements. Lastly, none
he figures of the fossils include a scale bar or any other indication of scale! It is essential to
ude this.
While ammonium chloride whitening is beyond our current scope, we have added
supplemental figures (Figures S1-S3) that include color photographs of the bulla,
incus, mandibles, and thoracic vertebra. These color photographs, in conjunction
with the high resolution 3D models from micro-CT scans combine for the best
possible visuals. Additionally, we have added scale bars to the figures.
natomical terminology is used inconsistently and/or incorrectly throughout the text and
res (see annotated PDF for specifics). For example: foramen ovale and fenestra ovale are
h used for the periotic feature that should be correctly referred to as the fenestra ovalis. Please
ure that one set of terms is decided upon and then used uniformly and accurately.
Corrected.
he discussion of phylogenetic analysis protocols and results are missing explanation of basic
isions, such as: choice of character/taxon data matrix for analysis; using a 50% majority rule
sensus tree and not the strict consensus tree to interpret the phylogenetic hypothesis; not
viding any basic measure of statistical support for the various clades in the tree/s. I am not
uing that these decisions are wrong, just that it would be helpful if the authors explained the
soning behind them.
Corrected.
he Description text is in part a comparative description, but there are very few detailed
parisons in the text of the morphology of the periotic, tympanic bulla and teeth of UWBM
04 with the morphology of these elements in at least other aetiocetid taxa. These elements
e not been adequately described across Aetiocetidae, with the exception of Fucaia buelli, so
re detailed comparisons between UWBM 50004 and other aetiocetids could reveal additional
racters of phylogenetic significance, especially with respect to the diagnosis of Salishicetus as
stinct taxon, relationships and taxonomy within Aetiocetidae, and the controversial
tionship between Aetiocetidae and Mammalodontidae.
This study aims to describe a new aetiocetid, and in doing so, we perform the most
thorough phylogenetic analysis respective to toothed mysticete taxa. However, a
complete analysis addressing additional characters and their relationships across
toothed mysticetes required a redescription of several key specimens (A. cotylalveus,
A. polydentatus, C. tomitai, C. sookensis, and C. yabukii). Such an endeavor is beyond
the scope of this study.

among toothed mysticetes, we favor explicit vocabulary to ensure maximum clarity.

Corrected.
e 407: is the enamel shelf the entocingulum?
This shelf may represent the entocingulum. However, late surviving stem cetaceans
“archaeocetes” do not retain the entocingulum. As such, the homology of cingulum
from terrestrial artiodactyls through stem cetaceans and into crown cetaceans
(which do not possess a cingulum), is very tenuous. We choose to describe this as an
enamel shelf to avoid over-interpretation of possible homology of artiodactyl
cingula.

e 608-614: add more to justify the taxonomic revision
All phylogenies represent hypotheses of potential evolutionary relationships.
Nevertheless, we argue very strongly that taxonomy needs to be informed by
phylogeny. While we are cautious about revising Morawanocetus yabukii and
Aetiocetus tomitai into Chonecetus, we find it unhelpful and irresponsible to
maintain a clade of these three taxa without such a revision. By not revising the
current taxonomic status of these taxa, our analysis leaves us with a paraphyletic
Aetiocetus, and adds taxonomic confusion at the generic level. Our taxonomic
revision ensures a monophyletic Aetiocetus and restricts the problematic taxa to a
single genus, thereby facilitating subsequent revision – indeed, future preparation of
Morawanocetus yabukii may yield sufficient information to resurrect its genus.
Given the positive feedback provided by reviewer 1 on the matter we suspect that
our existing decision to revise and simplify the taxonomic problems within
Aetiocetidae is preferable.

Only the posteriormost tooth from each side of the palate is known from
Morawanocetus. These teeth are described by Barnes (1994) are comparable in
morphology to those of A. tomitai. We feel confident in describing Salishicetus as the
aetiocetid with the most strongly heterodont dentition known among aetiocetids.

first request is the inclusion of images highlighting the wear features on the teeth and
brasure pits on the dentaries. Photos and 3D models of these elements are available (Figs. 8-9)
are of insufficient resolution to make out these features, which are an important part of the
hors' argument regarding feeding style in this specimen. Also, I could not find scale bars for
specimens; did I miss these?
Corrected. We have added color photographs as requested by reviewers
(supplementary figures S1-S3). The photos of the mandible also include dorsal views
on which the embrasure pits can be seen. Additionally, scale bars have been added.
second request is for more detailed information on the calculations used to estimate the total
gth of this specimen. Besides uncertainty in the estimated bizygomatic width of this
cimen, there is additional uncertainty in the equation used for this calculation.
knowledging these uncertainties directly or by reporting a possible size range for the
cimen would be helpful.
We revised the explanation of how we derived a complete bizygomatic width
measurement in the main text. Pyenson and Sponberg (2011) created formulae to
calculate TL based on different inputs, with single values as the outputs for
simplicity. Salishicetus is too incomplete to provide anything more than bizygomatic
width, hence our single TL estimate.

: Just a comment that I appreciated the detailed description you provided when explaining
you determined the positions of the teeth in the left and right dentaries. Nice job.
Okay.
