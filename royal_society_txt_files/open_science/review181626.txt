The manuscript by Worley et al demonstrated that the plant-animal worm Symsagittifera
roscoffensis could contract and curve under disturbance which facilitates flocculation. Groups of
worms flocculate so that they could descend faster than single worms to reach to bottom of
shallow water to avoid being carried away by tide. The research is interesting and would
complement the development of the S. roscoffensis in other subjects.

OVERVIEW
This study covers a very interesting topic and the authors appear to have addressed the previous
referee comments satisfactorily in revising the manuscript and responding to individual
3
comments. I have no major comments, but offer a few minor suggestions for improvement of the
manuscript, and my thoughts regarding their responses to reviewer comments.
MINOR COMMENTS
Numbers and their units should always be separated by a space (e.g. 15 mm, not 15mm).
l.129 – A fuller description should be provided by what is meant by “filtered seawater” (e.g. how
it was filtered, what mesh size was used etc.). Also, words like “substantial” are open to
interpretation, so I would suggest a more specific description of the size of this air bubble.
l.183-184 – Does this mean that the worms aggregated in less than 50 % of the runs (i.e. 17 out of
36)? If so, then I think this is an important result that should be elaborated upon in the discussion,
given the important role this behaviour potentially plays in survival the authors are discussing in
relation to the evolutionary advantage of this behaviour.
l.214: Delete the comma after “above it”.
l.247: Why do the authors refer to “Our flocs”? I suggest that this use of language is too
personal.
RESPONSES TO REFEREE 2 COMMENTS:
1) I agree with the authors that there is no need to increase the size of the experimental data set. If
it was straightforward to carry out repeat experiments perhaps it would be of interest to do this.
However, the patterns observed already and statistical analysis seems sufficiently robust as it
stands, also given the nature of the fieldwork, it seasonality, and the need for self-funding, it
would seem unnecessary to insist on further experiments.
RESPONSES TO REFEREE 1 COMMENTS:
2) The referee says that the “evidence for social behavior is preliminary. The rules of
interaction are not fully addressed.”. This may be true, but I don’t see why this should prevent
the current description of this flocculation behaviour being published in its current state.
3) I agree with the authors, that there is sufficient indication of social behaviour to leave this
phrase within the current manuscript, and rely on future studies to more thoroughly dissect the
nature and controls of this behaviour in these worms.
4) I agree with the authors, and do not find any inconsistencies regarding annotation for velocity.

Associate Editor's comments:
Thank you for submitting this extension to your earlier work in Royal Society Open Science. The
reviewers broadly favour publication, but have queried your response to the absence of ethical
approval being sought before conducting the research. While the work is carried out on
invertebrates, it is nevertheless common to seek approval from your institution's ethical
committee prior to conducting interventions such as this research (see, for instance,
https://royalsociety.org/~/media/journals/ethics/abguidelines2017.pdf?la=en-GB).
The Editors would like the authors to provide an explanation of why they did not seek approvals
from their ethics committee (even if none were subsequently required, it is best practice to ask
the question)? We will look forward to receiving your response to this - and the the other
reviewers' - query.

Sendova-Franks and Nigel R. Franks
Responses to Editor’s and Referees' Comments
Associate Editor's comments:
(1) Thank you for submitting this extension to your earlier work in Royal Society Open
Science. The reviewers broadly favour publication, but have queried your response to
the absence of ethical approval being sought before conducting the research. While the
work is carried out on invertebrates, it is nevertheless common to seek approval from
your institution's ethical committee prior to conducting interventions such as this
research (see, for instance,
https://royalsociety.org/~/media/journals/ethics/abguidelines2017.pdf?la=en-GB).
Thank you for the positive comments about our paper. Please see under (2) below our
response to the query regarding ethics in research involving animals.
(2) The Editors would like the authors to provide an explanation of why they did not seek
approvals from their ethics committee (even if none were subsequently required, it is
best practice to ask the question)? We will look forward to receiving your response to
this - and the the other reviewers' - query.
At the time of the study our understanding was that no ethical approval was needed
for this type of research on a non-endangered and locally super-abundant worm.
Having said that, we were very conscious of the ethics of research involving animals
and followed the ARRIVE guidelines (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines) as
well as the Guidelines for the treatment of animals in behavioural research and
teaching
(https://royalsociety.org/~/media/journals/ethics/abguidelines2017.pdf?la=en-GB)
published by the journal of Animal Behaviour (indeed one of us served as an executive
editor of this journal until recently).
More specifically, we minimised any harm to the individual plant-animal worms by
returning them and the original sea water to the exact location from where they had
been collected immediately after the experiment on the day of their collection. The
worms bury themselves in the sand at the next tide. We minimised any disturbance to
their habitat by collecting worms from a publicly accessible beach where fishermen,
boat-users and walkers tread. Our collections did not involve any digging of the sand
or any other disturbance of the natural state of the habitat. The numbers of worms
involved in the experiments was very small in comparison with the millions in the
thriving groups on the beach where we have visited them for the last seven years.
1
We have updated our Animal ethics statement accordingly (ll. 300-304).
Reviewer: 1
(3) The manuscript by Worley et al demonstrated that the plant-animal worm
Symsagittifera roscoffensis could contract and curve under disturbance which facilitates
flocculation. Groups of worms flocculate so that they could descend faster than single
worms to reach to bottom of shallow water to avoid being carried away by tide. The
research is interesting and would complement the development of the S. roscoffensis in
other subjects.
Thank you for these encouraging words.
(4) 1. line 34 and line 292: ‘cooperative behavior’ and ‘social behavior’ should be changed
to ‘collective behavior’. The horizontal circular behavior demonstrated in an earlier
publication has not been shown to link to this flocculation behavior.
We have made both these changes (ll. 34, 296).
(5) 2. Line 23 and line 288: the aspect of energy saving was not demonstrated in the
manuscript.
We have deleted “energy-saving” (l. 23) and “and with less energy expenditure” (l.
293).
(6) 3. Table 1: The image number could be moved into supplementary data, keeping only
<U+0394>t(i3-i1).
We have considered this suggestion carefully but with all due respect we disagree
because we are concerned this would sever the link between Fig. 5 and Table 1. In
addition, we do not think it would save any space.
(7) 4. Legend of Figure 4, the color of medium and large was the same. Different marker
shape could be used for better separation.
We have used a blue open square for the large flocs so that both the shape and colour
of the symbol are different for each floc size (Fig. 4, l. 230).
Reviewer: 2
OVERVIEW
(8) This study covers a very interesting topic and the authors appear to have addressed the
previous referee comments satisfactorily in revising the manuscript and responding to
individual comments. I have no major comments, but offer a few minor suggestions for
2
improvement of the manuscript, and my thoughts regarding their responses to reviewer
comments.
Thank you for the encouragement.
MINOR COMMENTS
(9) Numbers and their units should always be separated by a space (e.g. 15 mm, not
15mm).
This has been implemented throughout the manuscript and ESM.
(10) l.129 – A fuller description should be provided by what is meant by “filtered seawater”
(e.g. how it was filtered, what mesh size was used etc.). Also, words like “substantial”
are open to interpretation, so I would suggest a more specific description of the size of
this air bubble.
After “filtered seawater”, we added “(passed through a plastic sieve with square
holes of side 0.85 mm)” (ll. 128-129).
We had stated the air bubble size in the ESM but now we have added it to the main
text as “height of 17.2 ± 8.0 mm (mean ± sd), n=16” (ll. 129-130).
(11) l.183-184 – Does this mean that the worms aggregated in less than 50 % of the runs
(i.e. 17 out of 36)? If so, then I think this is an important result that should be
elaborated upon in the discussion, given the important role this behaviour potentially
plays in survival the authors are discussing in relation to the evolutionary advantage of
this behaviour.
No, while it is true that 17 out of 36 runs yielded filmable flocs, the runs that did not
yield filmable flocs may have been associated with smaller bubbles that did not cause
sufficient disturbance. We have added a sentence to this effect in the Results (ll. 186-
187). We have also added two sentences to the Discussion on the implications for the
evolutionary advantage of floc behaviour: “Some replicates did not yield filmable
flocs and we think this might be associated with a lack of sufficient perturbation. This
suggests that the tendency to floc in individual worms is tuneable by natural
selection.” (ll. 257-259).
(12) l.214: Delete the comma after “above it”.
We edited the initial sentence “The floc appears to have a toroidal structure (see also
figure S8), is descending into clear water and above it, are many single worms it is
shedding.” Now it is replaced by “The floc appears to have a toroidal structure (see
also figure S8). It is descending into clear water and shedding many single worms that
follow above it.” (ll. 214-215).
3
(13) l.247: Why do the authors refer to “Our flocs”? I suggest that this use of language is too
personal.
We replaced “Our flocs” with “The flocs in the present study” (l. 248).
RESPONSES TO REFEREE 2 COMMENTS:
(14) 1) I agree with the authors that there is no need to increase the size of the
experimental data set. If it was straightforward to carry out repeat experiments
perhaps it would be of interest to do this. However, the patterns observed already and
statistical analysis seems sufficiently robust as it stands, also given the nature of the
fieldwork, it seasonality, and the need for self-funding, it would seem unnecessary to
insist on further experiments.
Thank you.

(15) 2) The referee says that the “evidence for social behavior is preliminary. The rules of
interaction are not fully addressed.”. This may be true, but I don’t see why this should
prevent the current description of this flocculation behaviour being published in its
current state.
Thank you.
(16) 3) I agree with the authors, that there is sufficient indication of social behaviour to
leave this phrase within the current manuscript, and rely on future studies to more
thoroughly dissect the nature and controls of this behaviour in these worms.
Thank you.
(17) 4) I agree with the authors, and do not find any inconsistencies regarding annotation
for velocity.
Thank you. We avoided the possibility for confusion between v for velocity and <U+03BD> (nu)
for kinematic viscosity. We deleted the latter and employed a method of calculating
the Reynolds number (Re) suggested by R. McNeill Alexander in his book on
Functional design in fishes (ll. 63-64).
