The authors sampled migratory bats killed at wind turbines on the same night vs different nights,
and asked whether the same-night dyads were more likely to be genetically related or to have
similar stable isotope values. If bats are learning migration routes, then they should have higher
relatedness and similar isotope profiles. Instead they found no evidence for these predictions.
This paper is very well written and the overall question and basic approach taken is excellent, but
(there’s always a “but”) I would like to see an additional analysis of the genetic data and an
additional statistical analysis, before I would be able to fully interpret the results. Fortunately,
both of these new analyses could be done very quickly (e.g. in the time it took me to write this
review).
Basically, there are two places where I feel that the authors might be needlessly losing statistical
power.
Issue 1
I do not think that the choice of relatedness estimator was optimal. The maximum likelihood
relatedness values used here are truncated from 0-1, which might be good for contexts where all
unrelated animals might be considered the same (r=0). However, truncated relatedness throws
out most of the variation (and so you lose power for a linear model). For this analysis, I would
think one would want to look at pairwise genetic distance as a continuous and normally
distributed variable that is not truncated (-1 to 1), using any of the non-max-likelihood estimators.
This would allow one to differentiate further between unrelated bats of different levels of genetic
distance (e.g. possibly same population vs different population). I provide a link explaining how
to do this below. Of course, a different estimator should not change your main finding that close
kinship has no effect, but it might, and see the next comment.
Issue 2
For the first analysis (contingency test), the relatedness variable is reduced to a binary variable.
This throws out a lot of information and power. The second analysis using a generalized linear
model maintains relatedness as a continuous variable, but then turns observation day into a
continuous variable. This is might be good to do, but if we are interested in following behavior or
flying together, then we only care about same night vs different night. As the authors say, bats
coming from similar sites are already expected to arrive at similar times for asocial reasons.
Looking at number of days apart only makes that problem worse. Bats observed on different
nights can be placed together as “not following” because the rest of the variation in time between
days is not meaningfully related to the genetics and just adds noise to the test.
Suggested solution
So I would like to see a test that compares same night vs different night dyads using a new
measure of pairwise relatedness — a non-truncated relatedness estimate obtained from the
optimal estimator as decided through simulations (see a link on how to do this below). The
authors already have all the data they need to do it. The results might not change, but the paper
would be much stronger and more convincing to readers. In my opinion, this is the most
powerful test of the key hypothesis.
3
Caveat to discuss
The reason power is so crucial here is because the effect of paternal kinship should already be
adding a lot of statistical noise (unless I’m missing something). Half of related dyads are related
through their father and we don’t expect social transmission through paternal kin in bats. So
these paternal relatives are functionally “unrelated” for the purposes of the learning hypothesis.
This could be parsed out using mitochondrial DNA in future studies. But it should just be
discussed here as a caveat for interpreting the findings. The bats might not follow kin *in
general*, but they might follow *maternal* kin more than chance and that signal could be lost in
the noise. One wonders if that was the case especially with p-values like 0.06.
Those two analysis concerns and one caveat aside, I find this study to be exceptionally well-
written and interesting. The question of how bats decide where to migrate is one of the most
pressing questions in bat biology and behavior right now, especially given the conservation
implications. The extent to which migration routes are learned or socially learned has
implications for how quickly bat populations are likely to adjust to changes in their migration
routes due to wind farms installations (either by learning or natural selection). And I believe the
general approach taken here is right on target as the next necessary step. This paper is also
valuable because it provides new microsatellite markers for these two species. This is an
important study, and I look forward to seeing it published.

Abstract
This abstract is very clear and well written.
Intro
83 need to specify somewhere earlier that Chiroptera=bats, or just use the word “bats”
Methods and results
211 I don’t think that providing higher relatedness values is the best way to choose an estimator
for this analysis. Yes, the ML methods account for genotyping errors, but one potential issue is
that those two ML estimation methods are truncated at zero (this might make sense if all the bats
are from the same breeding population but that is not the case here). As a result, there is not a
normal distribution of relatedness values. Perhaps you want to treat all bats that are not in the
same family the same. However, it seems to make a lot of sense in this case to label unrelated bats
according to their pairwise genetic distance. For example, imagine that bat A and B are unrelated
but from the same local population, and that bat C is also unrelated to bat A but is from a
completely different population many miles away. Your relatedness estimate will treat A’s
relatedness to both B and C as zero. However, a different method (for example the Wang
estimator or Queller-Goodnight estimator in coancestry) would likely present relatedness A-B as
zero and A-C as a negative value (indicating that the two unrelated bats are even less related than
two average bats from the population).
Assuming some limitations on natal dispersal, this actually allows you to use the genetic data as
another possible proxy for bats originating from the same site (but not sure about that— it
depends on genetic variation across different sites).
4
I would suggest using the r package “related” to first run a simulation to choose the best
unbiased non-truncated estimator”. Then use that estimator and see if the results are consistent.
This is actually very straightforward, and there are step-by-step directions here:
https://frasierlab.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/tutorial1.pdf
This could be done pretty quickly.
218 This test loses power because a continuous variable (relatedness) is being transformed into a
binary variable (kin or not). Why not keep relatedness as a continuous variable?
Just as you did, I would still compare same night vs different night, because bats found on
different nights could not possibly have been following each other. But I would look at
relatedness as a normally distributed continuous variable. In my opinion, this analysis could
replace both relatedness tests you did (unless I’m missing something).
It would be helpful to see the distribution of isotope values (how are they distributed?), maybe in
a supplement.
235-243 I was looking for all this information (e.g., number of markers) in the methods. So it
might be better to put it there.
Could the relationships between geographic origin and days between death at turbines could be
explained by bats from similar latitudes or sites taking similar times to reach that point in their
southern migration (rather than social learning)? For that reason, I think an analysis that simply
contrasts same night vs different night makes more sense.
Discussion
284-285 I would not speak about pedigree kinship terms such as parent-offspring or full-sibling
(at least say “putative” or “suspected”), because it can be very difficult to reliably place dyads
into these categories using microsatellite genotypes alone. Good reference: Van Horn, R. C.,
Altmann, J., & Alberts, S. C. (2008). Can't get there from here: inferring kinship from pairwise
genetic relatedness. Animal Behaviour, 75(3), 1173-1180.
318-326 I agree with this paragraph, but I’m not sure of its relevance to migration. What does
obtaining migration information “asocially” mean? Does it mean just flying south and then using
trial and error learning over subsequent years?
337-342 This first part of the paragraph on a possible teaching mechanism of learning would
make more sense if the authors found evidence for learning, so it might not be necessary here. It
detracts from the main point which is that experienced adults might just leave earlier, which
prevents social learning.
364 But see Yossi Yovel lab’s work on bats use of echolocation during group movements Cvikel et
al. 2015 Current Biology, Figure 3.
There is another potential caveat to discuss. One assumption here is that if bats are learning by
following kin, then bats found together should be more often related. However, bonds only form
between maternal kin, not paternal kin. There is no evidence that young bats form any
attachment or relationship with their fathers (or even know who they are). Moreover, fathers
might come from distant sites and not be groupmates at all.
5
Therefore, what you really predict is that they should be more *maternally* related. The paternal
relatedness adds statistical noise, because bats related through a father are actually, from
migration standpoint, functionally “unrelated”. So if paternal kin dyads are being found on
different nights this further reduces your power to detect any increased maternal kinship in bats
found on same nights (because you cannot tell maternal from paternal kinship). This possibility
should be discussed, because many readers might not realize it, especially those familiar with
songbirds where juveniles likely know both their mother and father.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors present an interesting study, using novel methodology to ask questions about the
social transmission of migratory behaviors. As the authors correctly point out, the question of
how migrants find their way is a long-standing issue in migration biology. More specifically, how
do young animals make their way in their first migration? This study has the strong advantage of
being based in a well-studied system, with several prior publications from the same sampling
period. The authors have prepared a well-written, easy to read manuscript, and they have done a
good job of incorporating the broader conceptual issues of social transmission rather than
focusing solely on the specific of their samples. However, I have some concerns about
assumptions that must be made in the development of the ideas and interpretation of the results.
The authors may be able to justify these assumptions based on their extensive work in this
system, but as presented in the manuscript I still have some concerns.
My main concern is the major underlying assumption that bats migrating together will be killed
by a wind turbine together. The authors collected tissue samples from bats killed by wind
turbines. They calculated relatedness of potential dyads and gathered information about
migratory origin from stable isotopes. The prediction was that if there is social transmission,
related bats should travel together and this should be apparent in the genotype and isotope data.
6
But what is the likelihood of two bats travelling together (regardless of relatedness) to both be
killed by a turbine and collected by a searcher? We have no idea what proportion of bats that fly
past a turbine are killed, but that will certainly factor in to the likelihood of both bats in a pair
being killed. Assuming bats travelling together maintain contact through echolocation calls (as
suggested in the manuscript) they could be flying several meters apart, decreasing the likelihood
of both being killed. The next question is seasonality. Is there indication of differential migration
timing of adults and subadults in this system? If there are distinct periods dominated by adult
mortality or subadult mortality, then the likelihood of social transmission is quite low. Then there
is the question of differential mortality rates of young and adults (and presumably there is data
from this system to see if fatalities deviate from the predicted 2:1 young:adult female ratio
assuming each adult female successfully rears two pups). Assuming both bats are killed, they
both have to fall within the searched area (presumably search radius is designed to find most bats
killed by a turbine), and they must both be found by searchers (and there is data on searcher
efficiency and scavenger removal to inform this likelihood). Taken all together, I think it is
unlikely that a pair of bats travelling together (regardless of relatedness) would be sampled. With
only 3 related dyads (full sibs or mother-offspring) observed in hoary bats (I don’t think father-
offspring is a realistic scenario for social transmission…see below), and only 1 full-sib dyad for
silver-haired bats, I think it is difficult to say anything conclusively. Thus the lack of relatedness
trends in the data may represent a Type II error.
All that being said, the authors have worked extensively in this system and there is likely data to
alleviate some of the concerns I have presented. I would suggest including some of this
information into the manuscript to help inform/support the interpretation of the genotype and
isotope data.
More specific comments below. Throughout the review I will refer to the line numbers helpfully
inserted by the authors rather than the line numbers inserted by the submission process that
don’t actually coincide with particular lines.
L100: There is also the alternative scenario that migratory flyways bring disparate groups of bats
together. In fact, the authors have presented data elsewhere to suggest that this system may
represent a flyway, with bats gathering along the foothills of the mountains rather than migrating
over open prairie.
L104: Why is it likely that young bats follow their mothers or other close relatives? An alternative
scenario is presented in the Thorup et al. paper cited in the introduction. In that study adults
followed a map, while hatch year birds simply followed the instinct to fly south. A similar
instinctual mechanism may occur in bats, particularly if adults depart the breeding grounds
before young.
L125: It may have been published after the authors prepared the manuscript, but it might be
worth mentioning Baird et al. 2015 J Mammalogy regarding suggested revision of the Lasiurine
bats. Those South American hoary bats aren’t particularly relevant to the current study.
L128: Clarify that this is the relevant distribution for the study region, not the entire continental
distribution.
L196: How could an adult from 2007 be potential offspring of another 2007 adult?
L260: should reference Table 3 instead of Table 5 I think.
7
L283: what is the mean relatedness of the dyads killed on the same night? It would have to be
low, given that the dyads are at most half-sibs. I think it is important to include how related the
dyads were, rather than just discussing related or unrelated dyads.
L285: I don’t think it should be surprising that father-sib dyads are killed on different nights.
Males do not participate in rearing the offspring and therefore would not be expected to migrate
together with the offspring.
L285: I think the sample sizes need to be included here for context. For hoary bats there was 1
mother-offspring dyad and 2 full sib dyads. For silver-haired bats there was 1 full-sib dyad. With
n=1 or n=2 I don’t think there is much that can be said conclusively.
L286: I’m not sure I agree with this conclusion. For this to be the case, we have to assume (as
described above) that both members of the dyad are killed by the same turbine, fall within the
searched area, and are found by the searchers. It is entirely plausible that only 1 member of the
dyad meets these criteria, which would then mean that parents and offspring, or siblings, could
be travelling together but it wouldn’t be documented with this methodology
L297: no need for underline
L328: considering the costs and benefits during migration is one way of thinking about the
system. But what are the costs and benefits of the decision to leave the young behind, as
described on L307. Early departure may have a great benefit. What are the costs of early
departure (leaving young to fend for themselves) compared to the benefits? If offspring require
more time to continue growth/development and build energy stores to fuel their migration, it
may be in the mother’s best interests to begin migration earlier than her offspring if there is little
she can do to increase the survival probability of her offspring (either on the breeding grounds, or
during migration). I don’t think we can answer this question, but another interesting way of
considering the decision.

social transmission of migratory behaviors. As the authors correctly point out, the question of
how migrants find their way is a long-standing issue in migration biology. More specifically, how
do young animals make their way in their first migration? This study has the strong advantage of
being based in a well-studied system, with several prior publications from the same sampling
period. The authors have prepared a well-written, easy to read manuscript, and they have done a
good job of incorporating the broader conceptual issues of social transmission rather than
13
focusing solely on the specific of their samples. However, I have some concerns about
assumptions that must be made in the development of the ideas and interpretation of the results.
The authors may be able to justify these assumptions based on their extensive work in this
system, but as presented in the manuscript I still have some concerns.
My main concern is the major underlying assumption that bats migrating together will be killed
by a wind turbine together. The authors collected tissue samples from bats killed by wind
turbines. They calculated relatedness of potential dyads and gathered information about
migratory origin from stable isotopes. The prediction was that if there is social transmission,
related bats should travel together and this should be apparent in the genotype and isotope data.
But what is the likelihood of two bats travelling together (regardless of relatedness) to both be
killed by a turbine and collected by a searcher? We have no idea what proportion of bats that fly
past a turbine are killed, but that will certainly factor in to the likelihood of both bats in a pair
being killed. Assuming bats travelling together maintain contact through echolocation calls (as
suggested in the manuscript) they could be flying several meters apart, decreasing the likelihood
of both being killed. The next question is seasonality. Is there indication of differential migration
timing of adults and subadults in this system? If there are distinct periods dominated by adult
mortality or subadult mortality, then the likelihood of social transmission is quite low. Then there
is the question of differential mortality rates of young and adults (and presumably there is data
from this system to see if fatalities deviate from the predicted 2:1 young:adult female ratio
assuming each adult female successfully rears two pups). Assuming both bats are killed, they
both have to fall within the searched area (presumably search radius is designed to find most bats
killed by a turbine), and they must both be found by searchers (and there is data on searcher
efficiency and scavenger removal to inform this likelihood). Taken all together, I think it is
unlikely that a pair of bats travelling together (regardless of relatedness) would be sampled. With
only 3 related dyads (full sibs or mother-offspring) observed in hoary bats (I don’t think father-
offspring is a realistic scenario for social transmission…see below), and only 1 full-sib dyad for
silver-haired bats, I think it is difficult to say anything conclusively. Thus the lack of relatedness
trends in the data may represent a Type II error.
All that being said, the authors have worked extensively in this system and there is likely data to
alleviate some of the concerns I have presented. I would suggest including some of this
information into the manuscript to help inform/support the interpretation of the genotype and
isotope data.
More specific comments below. Throughout the review I will refer to the line numbers helpfully
inserted by the authors rather than the line numbers inserted by the submission process that
don’t actually coincide with particular lines.
L100: There is also the alternative scenario that migratory flyways bring disparate groups of bats
together. In fact, the authors have presented data elsewhere to suggest that this system may
represent a flyway, with bats gathering along the foothills of the mountains rather than migrating
over open prairie.
L104: Why is it likely that young bats follow their mothers or other close relatives? An alternative
scenario is presented in the Thorup et al. paper cited in the introduction. In that study adults
followed a map, while hatch year birds simply followed the instinct to fly south. A similar
instinctual mechanism may occur in bats, particularly if adults depart the breeding grounds
before young.
L125: It may have been published after the authors prepared the manuscript, but it might be
worth mentioning Baird et al. 2015 J Mammalogy regarding suggested revision of the Lasiurine
bats. Those South American hoary bats aren’t particularly relevant to the current study.
14
L128: Clarify that this is the relevant distribution for the study region, not the entire continental
distribution.
L196: How could an adult from 2007 be potential offspring of another 2007 adult?
L260: should reference Table 3 instead of Table 5 I think.
L283: what is the mean relatedness of the dyads killed on the same night? It would have to be
low, given that the dyads are at most half-sibs. I think it is important to include how related the
dyads were, rather than just discussing related or unrelated dyads.
L285: I don’t think it should be surprising that father-sib dyads are killed on different nights.
Males do not participate in rearing the offspring and therefore would not be expected to migrate
together with the offspring.
L285: I think the sample sizes need to be included here for context. For hoary bats there was 1
mother-offspring dyad and 2 full sib dyads. For silver-haired bats there was 1 full-sib dyad. With
n=1 or n=2 I don’t think there is much that can be said conclusively.
L286: I’m not sure I agree with this conclusion. For this to be the case, we have to assume (as
described above) that both members of the dyad are killed by the same turbine, fall within the
searched area, and are found by the searchers. It is entirely plausible that only 1 member of the
dyad meets these criteria, which would then mean that parents and offspring, or siblings, could
be travelling together but it wouldn’t be documented with this methodology
L297: no need for underline
L328: considering the costs and benefits during migration is one way of thinking about the
system. But what are the costs and benefits of the decision to leave the young behind, as
described on L307. Early departure may have a great benefit. What are the costs of early
departure (leaving young to fend for themselves) compared to the benefits? If offspring require
more time to continue growth/development and build energy stores to fuel their migration, it
may be in the mother’s best interests to begin migration earlier than her offspring if there is little
she can do to increase the survival probability of her offspring (either on the breeding grounds, or
during migration). I don’t think we can answer this question, but another interesting way of
considering the decision.

I am fully satisfied with this revision. Very well-written, thoughtful, and clear.
Some minor suggestions for clarity:
line 28 Insert “would” before “need” to stress the hypothetical meaning.
For a young bat to learn migration via social transmission, they [would] need to follow an
experienced individual…
line 30 Insert “would” before “follow”: "It is also likely that young bats [would] follow their…"
line 55 Typo: delete parenthesis
line 78 Most cognition researchers would not say that teaching has been demonstrated in bats
(and I know the cited ref), so I would delete this, or say something like “and possibly teaching”.
Also,I would say that “observational learning” is a specific case within the general category of
“social transmission of behavior” and not list them separately.
line 222-223 Typo. There’s an extra parenthesis.
line 224 Change “Type one error” to "Type One Error" or "type one error"
Methods and results
I know from testing genetic methods against known pedigrees that programs often mislabel
kinship relationships (e.g. mother-offspring or half-sibs labeled as full-sibs, etc) more than their
confidence intervals would predict. For calculating the 95% probability of belonging to a kinship
category, are programs like COLONY assuming that the true mother or father is in the sample? If
16
not, then the writing is fine as it is. But if so, I would suggest adding “putative” or “suspected”
before full-sibs or half-sibs, etc, to clarify that those relationships are still really the best guess
with imperfect assumptions rather than known relationships with 95% confidence.
Discussion
347 “Because information obtained socially is often easier to obtain, but less reliable than
information obtained asocially (i.e. through trial-and-error), there is usually a mixture within a
group in the number of individuals acquiring information asocially and those acquiring
information socially [96, 97].”
I don’t think that’s *generally* true, so I would change “often” to "sometimes" and “usually” to
“often”
Great paper.

The revised manuscript addresses many of my concerns. The authors have added additional
information in a number of places that improves the manuscript. The questions, confusion, and
concerns I had based on the previous version have now been clarified for the most part. There is
only one remaining issue I think needs to be clarified.
L159: The authors have now clarified a misunderstanding I had from the initial version of the
manuscript, namely that all turbines within the facility were searched with enough regularity to
ensure a high likelihood of recovery of all bats. However there remains one bit of confusion…On
line 159 the authors indicate the high likelihood of recovering all bats, but on L164 it indicates
that tissue samples were only collected from bats killed on the previous night (10 of 39 turbines
searched on any given day). A high likelihood of recovering all bats is good, but only if all those
bats end up included in the dataset. Please clarify.
