Summary
In this study the authors adapted the CRISPR/cas9 technology in Leishmania, a parasite where it
was relatively complicated to perform reverse genetic studies, since it required multiple cloning
and transfection steps to generate null mutants for genes of interest. This did not allow to
interrogate the function of multiple genes in a scalable manner, but only in a slow 1-by-1
approach.
Here the Gluenz group adapted the cas9/CRISPR technology and went to great length to
generate a toolkit that allows the tagging and disruption of genes of interest without any cloning
step in bacteria. Instead the necessary gRNA and repair DNA can be simply generated by PCR.
They provide a detailed proof of concept and demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently modify
the genome of Leishmania using this technology.
Briefly, they:
3
- generate a parasite line expressing both, cas9 and T7-RNA Polymerase, which serves as
recipient strain. They convincingly demonstrate that expression of both genes has no major
effects in L.mexicana, L.major promastigotes or T.brucei bloodstream forms.
- demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently knock in and knock out with as little as 30nt
homology regions flanking the respective cassette
- demonstrate multiple genome modifications in a single transfection
- demonstrate one-step deletion of a gene important in flagella function (Pf16) and LPG
biosynthesis (LPG1).
- demonstrated rapid genome editing in L.major and T.brucei
Own opinion:
This is a very well performed proof of concept study. All controls have been carefully chosen and
I have only minor (editing) comments.
I congratulate the authors to such a nice study.
Minor comments:
- Did the authors also test the efficiency of their tool in amastigotes/procyclic forms? Is
expression of cas9 and T7-Pol as well tolerated in these?
- sgRNA presence for only 8h post transfection (Figure S3) in parasites could be moved to main
figure 3 or 4.
- Analysis of KO parasites for Pf16 could do with a WB/IFA demonstrating absence of the
protein.

The manuscript describes the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology for tagging and gene knockout in
diverse Leishmania species and bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei, which provides an
important technical advance for the study of this neglected human pathogens. The experimental
4
methods are sound and the manipulation of the parasites is well documented. I have only minor
comments and suggestions.
MAJOR COMMENTS:
1. Given that the central claim of the study is the use of CRISPR-Cas9 for rapid gene knockouts,
the authors should carefully document at least one of the knockouts by Southern blot analysis
(LPG, GPI-PLC?).
2. It will be interesting if the authors comment whether they found any evidence of
microhomology-mediated repair (or amplify and sequence several clones to characterize the
rearrangements giving rise to the tagged proteins).
3. The authors use two sgRNA templates and two drug resistance cassettes. Why? was the use of
only one of each unsuccessful?
MINOR COMMENTS:
4. Two recent reports on the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology in T. cruzi (Lander et al., JBC, 2016)
and L. donovani and L. mexicana (Zhang et al., mSphere, 2017) have appeared recently with new
information that could be useful to add to the Introduction.
5. Fig. S5 is cited after Figs. S6-8.
6. Fig. 7A legend is not very well written and the localization seems cytosolic rather than
flagellar, and different from that in reference 45.

congratulate the authors to such a nice study.
Minor comments:
Did the authors also test the efficiency of their tool in amastigotes/procyclic forms? Is
expression of cas9 and T7-Pol as well tolerated in these?
>Reply: Yes, these tools were also tested in T. brucei procyclic forms. As shown in the
growth curve in Fig. 8B, Cas9 and T7 RNA polymerase expression are well tolerated in
procyclic forms. Functionality was tested by tagging PF16, using the same methods as
described for L. mexicana and L. major, and, as might be expected, the same results were
obtained. Since these tagging results are the same for all species tested, and since we have
extensively documented tagging and knockout results for bloodstream form T. brucei, we did
not include an additional figure for tagging of procyclic forms.
We did not test amastigotes. The T7 RNA polymerase gene in cell line L. mex Cas9 T7 is
under the control of UTR sequences that mediate downregulation in amastigotes
Ishemgulova et al., Folia Parasitol (Praha). 63:016, 2016. doi: 10.14411/fp.2016.016.). In
plasmid pTB008, which we have constructed for expression of Cas9 and T7 RNAP from a
single plasmid (Table S3), T7 RNAP expression is regulated by the cysteine proteinase
cys2) 3’UTR, which is expected to allow T7 RNAP expression in all life cycle stages but this
orms are not routinely used for transfection, we did not explore this option here.
sgRNA presence for only 8h post transfection (Figure S3) in parasites could be moved to
main figure 3 or 4.
>Reply: this is an excellent suggestion and we have revised Fig. 3 to include this data (new
part 3E).
Analysis of KO parasites for Pf16 could do with a WB/IFA demonstrating absence of the
protein.
>Reply: there is currently no antibody against L. mexicana PF16 and it is therefore not
possible to add a Western blot without first raising an antibody. We believe that a Western
blot is not necessary to support our conclusions. We show that the PF16 coding sequence is
absent in the KO parasites; this is a single-copy gene, hence its deletion renders production
of a PF16 protein impossible. Moreover, as discussed in the text, the KO parasites show a
distinctive loss-of-motility phenotype, and defective axoneme, consistent with PF16 mutant
phenotypes in other organisms as discussed in the text. Moreover, adding back a copy of
PF16 restores motility. This data taken together convincingly demonstrates that our method
achieves deletion of the PF16 gene, and this loss causes the observed phenotypes.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript describes the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology for tagging and gene
knockout in diverse Leishmania species and bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei,
which provides an important technical advance for the study of this neglected human
pathogens. The experimental methods are sound and the manipulation of the parasites is
well documented. I have only minor comments and suggestions.
MAJOR COMMENTS:
1. Given that the central claim of the study is the use of CRISPR-Cas9 for rapid gene
knockouts, the authors should carefully document at least one of the knockouts by Southern
blot analysis (LPG, GPI-PLC?).
>Reply: all phenotypes shown in our study are fully consistent with diverse previously
published and extensively documented knockout phenotypes in cells generated though
raditional methods of gene replacement by homologous recombination (LPG1, GPI-PLC)
and RNAi knockdown (PF16). We chose to use PCR to show that all deleted coding
sequences were undetectable in the mutants. The high sensitivity of PCR would allow
detection of the target gene sequence even if only a small subset of the population had
detectable by PCR in double drug resistant populations. Hence we believe the data shown in
he paper conclusively demonstrate that our method was successful in achieving deletion of
he target genes.
2. It will be interesting if the authors comment whether they found any evidence of
microhomology-mediated repair (or amplify and sequence several clones to characterize the
earrangements giving rise to the tagged proteins).
>Reply: In this study we have not investigated in detail how double strand breaks (DSBs) in
Leishmania are repaired. For two target genes we did analyse genomic DNA from several
clones each (and for one target gene also the genomic DNA from non-clonal populations)
and sequenced across the integration sites. Our results showed that the donor DNA is
ntegrated precisely, without insertions or deletions (as shown for one analysed gene in Fig.
S6). Microhomology-mediated repair might be expected to give rise to small deletions (Zhang
and Matlashewski, 2015) and we did not find any evidence for this. However, in light of a
ecent report showing that microhomology-mediated repair may facilitate integration of donor
DNA with short homology flanks (Zhang et al., 2017) we have added a sentence to the
esults section to acknowledge this possibility (p. 6; this also addresses comment 4 below).
We did initially assume that DSBs were repaired by homologous recombination (HR) in the
presence of donor DNA, as other authors did in the past (see Zhang et al., 2017). Given this
new information, published after the submission of our manuscript, we have now replaced in
he first sentence of our Conclusions “rapid and precise gene modification by HR” with “rapid
and precise gene modification by integration of donor DNA”, which does not make any claims
about the underlying mechanisms of DNA repair.
3. The authors use two sgRNA templates and two drug resistance cassettes. Why? was the
use of only one of each unsuccessful?
>Reply: the key advantage of our method is that mutant phenotypes are readily detected in
non-clonal populations. Whilst introduction of only one type of drug-selectable marker
cassette can give rise to null mutants (both alleles deleted), selection with one drug does not
eliminate heterozygous mutants in which one wild type allele remains. Using two drug
esistance cassettes ensures that only cells that have integrated both cassettes (and
consequently deleted both alleles of a gene) survive double drug selection. Whilst we have
some preliminary data that suggested that one sgRNA template may be sufficient to achieve
gene knockouts, we have chosen to use two sgRNA templates routinely to produce a double-
strand break upstream and downstream of the target gene, to excise it cleanly from the
genome.
MINOR COMMENTS:
4. Two recent reports on the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology in T. cruzi (Lander et al., JBC,
2016) and L. donovani and L. mexicana (Zhang et al., mSphere, 2017) have appeared
ecently with new information that could be useful to add to the Introduction.
>Reply: we have added these important new references to the introduction and cited
evidence from the Zhang et al., paper in the discussion of our results (p. 6; see reply to
comment 2 above).
5. Fig. S5 is cited after Figs. S6-8.
>Reply: the text has been amended, placing the first citation of Fig. S5 before Fig. S6.
6. Fig. 7A legend is not very well written and the localization seems cytosolic rather than
lagellar, and different from that in reference 45.
>Reply: the legend has been revised for clarity. We acknowledge the localization for GPI-
PLC has been a controversial issue over the years but believe our results are consistent with
he referenced publication. In the cited publication (Sunter et al., 2013) GPI-PLC was shown
o localise to both the flagellum membrane and the cell body membrane and was 4-fold
enriched on the former. Here we clearly show that the tagged GPI-PLC was enriched on the
lagellum membrane but also found on the cell body membrane. There are some
experimental differences between to the two papers that could potentially explain the
apparent differences observed in the fluorescence micrographs. In Sunter at al., 2013 the
cells were only lightly fixed for microscopy using 0.075% formaldehyde, whereas here a
stronger fixation of 4% formaldehyde was used and this is the likely explanation for the less
smooth GPI-PLC signal seen here versus the 2013 work. Importantly, our images show a
clear 'edge effect', which is indicative of a membrane protein, and thus we interpret the
cytosolic” signal the reviewer referred to as signal coming from surface-localised GPI-PLC,
consistent with the cited reference.
7. Some arrows in Fig. 4 (from primers 4 and 5 to positions 4 and 5 of pPLOT) are missing.
>Reply: we have added the required arrows to revised Fig. 4
8. The results of Fig. 5 could be supported by western blot analysis of PF16.
>Reply: there is currently no antibody against L. mexicana PF16 and it is therefore not
possible to add a Western blot. We believe that a Western blot is not necessary to support
our conclusions as explained in our reply to reviewer 2.
9. The dilutions of the antibodies used should be indicated.
>Reply: the antibody dilutions are specified in the “Supplementary methods” in ESM file 1;
his is now made clearer in the section “western blots” in the “Materials and Methods” section
n the main text.
>Reply: the legends to Figs 1, 2, 4, S7 and S8 have been amended accordingly.
