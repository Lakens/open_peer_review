The manuscript “Flexible transparent electrodes based on silver nanowires synthesized via a
simple method” by De Li, Tao Han, Lei Zhang, Huai Zhang and Hui Chen investigated to control
the morphology of Ag nanomaterials by using a hydrothermal procedure. The authors reported a
useful strategy to synthesize AgNWs. The subject of the paper is suitable for Royal Society Open
Science. The manuscript is clearly organized. Therefore I recommend publication of the
manuscript after minor revision:
(1) In Experimental section, Material, “poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)” should be changed to “Poly(vinyl
pyrrolidone)”.
(2) In Experimental section, Synthesis of Ag NWs, “160 oC” should be changed to “<U+2103>”.
(3) On the 13th line, in Results and discussion, the second paragraph, “(fwhm)” should be
changed to “(FWHM)”.
(4) Sodium citrate reduction approach was used to prepare the Ag nanomaterials. For example: J.
Am. Ceram. Soc., 99 [10] 3330–3335 (2016). What are the advantages of the present work in
comparison with the sodium citrate reduction approach?
(5) the board absorption peak ranging from 320 to 800 nm was observed when the AgNO3
concentration is larger than 0.03, which may be related to the coupling reaction of Ag
nanomaterials. OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS, 2017, 7(4): 1188-1197.

The authors report an interesting approach to synthesize the flexible transparent electrodes based
on silver nanowires via a simple, cost-effective, high-yield and eco-friendly procedure, of which
the resistance and transmittance is enhanced by optimizing the concentration of silver nanowire
solution. The study may provide an effective way to improve the flexible transparent electrode
with high performance, thus it could be recommended for further minor revision in order to meet
the requirements for publication as listed below.

1) Some grammar errors exist such as “parametersin” (page 1, line 36), “…reaction system
to synthesize AgNWs, which average diameter…”, “All chemicals used in this work without any
further purification”, and so on.
2) “In addition, the 430 nm peak exhibits a broad full-width at half-maximum (fwhm) of100
nm attributed to the tailing effect, which demonstrates that the existence of Ag nanoparticles with
a broad distribution in size and morphology (see curve c - d).” “Due to the large diameters of Ag
NWs (approximately 300 nm), the reflection and scattering of light increase on Ag NW film,
furthermore, decrease the film transmittance” is not clear and need to be modified. (See in the
second and fifth paragraph of Results and discussion part).
3) The conclusions, “It can be seen that the transmittance decline with the
increase of sheet resistance.” and “the composite electrodes exhibit excellent mechanical strain
due to the slight change in bend test.”, seem to inaccurate with the experimental results, thus it
need to be confirmed.

where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal

Appendix A
Response to Referees
Reviewer: 1
(1) In Experimental section, Material, “poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)” should
be changed to “Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)”.
Response: The error has been modified. On the first line in Material, see
the green highlight text.
(2) In Experimental section, Synthesis of Ag NWs, “160 oC” should be
changed to “<U+2103>”.
Response: The error has been modified. On the sixth line in Synthesis of
Ag NWs, see the green highlight text.
(3) On the 13th line, in Results and discussion, the second paragraph,
“(fwhm)” should be changed to “(FWHM)”.
Response: The error has been modified. On the 13th line, in Results and
discussion, the second paragraph, see the green highlight text.
(4) Sodium citrate reduction approach was used to prepare the Ag
nanomaterials. For example: J. Am. Ceram. Soc., 99 [10] 3330–3335
(2016). What are the advantages of the present work in comparison with
the sodium citrate reduction approach?
Response: We have read the aforementioned article carefully and quoted
the article (J. Am. Ceram. Soc., 99 [10] 3330–3335 (2016) ) as a
reference (No.15, see the green highlight text) in our article.
(5) the board absorption peak ranging from 320 to 800 nm was observed
when the AgNO3 concentration is larger than 0.03, which may be related
to the coupling reaction of Ag nanomaterials. OPTICAL MATERIALS
EXPRESS, 2017, 7(4): 1188-1197.
Response: We appreciate the comments of the reviewer and added the
article (OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS, 2017, 7(4): 1188-1197.) as
a reference (No.29, see the green highlight text) in our article.
Reviewer: 2
(1) Some grammar errors exist such as “parametersin” (page 1, line 36),
“…reaction system to synthesize AgNWs, which average diameter…”,
“All chemicals used in this work without any further purification”, and so
on.
Response: The errors had been modified.
<U+2460> On the 18th line, in the Introduction, see the green highlight text.
<U+2461> On the 24th and 25th line, in Introduction, see the green highlight text.
<U+2462> On the 4th and 5th line in Material, see the yellow highlight text.
(2) “In addition, the 430 nm peak exhibits a broad full-width at
half-maximum (fwhm) of 100 nm attributed to the tailing effect, which
demonstrates that the existence of Ag nanoparticles with a broad
distribution in size and morphology (see curve c - d).” “Due to the large
diameters of Ag NWs (approximately 300 nm), the reflection and
scattering of light increase on Ag NW film, furthermore, decrease the
film transmittance” is not clear and need to be modified. (See in the
second and fifth paragraph of Results and discussion part).
Response: We deleted “(see curve c - d) ” in the revised manuscript.
“Due to the large diameters of Ag NWs (approximately 300 nm), the
reflection and scattering of light increase on Ag NW film, furthermore,
decrease the film transmittance” was modified to be “Due to the large
diameters of Ag NWs (approximately 300 nm), the light reflection and
diffusion of Ag NW films increase but light transmission decreases”.
These parts are highlighted by colored (yellow) text.
(3) The conclusions, “It can be seen that the transmittance decline with
the increase of sheet resistance.” and “the composite electrodes exhibit
excellent mechanical strain due to the slight change in bend test.”, seem
to inaccurate with the experimental results, thus it need to be confirmed.
Response: The above sentences were modified to be “It can be seen that
the transmittance increases with the increase of sheet resistance.” and
“the composite electrodes exhibit excellent stability of electrical property
due to the slight change in bend test”. These parts are highlighted in
colored (yellow) text.
