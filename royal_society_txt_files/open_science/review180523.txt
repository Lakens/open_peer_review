The manuscript considers an interesting aspect of the impact of light variation due to the
hydrodynamics in an algae-growth raceway. The paper is not well written, but I have included
an electronic markup suggesting improvements.
What concerns me the most is that contrary to all research with which I am familiar, the flashing
light effect actually decreased algae growth. What else is unusual is that subjecting algae to
continuous light is quite detrimental to their growth because they have no opportunity to recover
from oxidative stress, which is done when it is dark. So, it is never a good idea to grow algae in
continuous light and switching to long-period light exposure should generally outperform
continuous light exposure with regard to growth rate.
Moreover, there is a notable nonlinearity in the measured growth rates where constant light
yields the highest growth rate, which is then minimum for the shortest period used, then
increasing with period, then decreasing, then increasing again with period. The authors claim
"very replicable" experimental results. I have personally grown algae cultures in triplicate in
various conditions and never found the results to be "very replicable." I think it is incumbent on
the authors to demonstrate what they mean by "very replicable" by presenting their growth-rate
data.
The authors claim that the wild nonlinearity in growth rate as a function of light exposure period
is due to unexplained variations in photoacclimation and photoinhibition. Without seeing the
growth-rate data, I would suspect this to be much more likely due to experimental error.
The authors never explicitly describe the light:dark ratios for the various periods studied. T=3.2
hours is noted, but this is not an apparent result from Figure 3 where the period looks much
shorter. Also, was the first hour of results discarded from this figure as noted in the modeling
section? Does T=3.2 hours mean that algae were illuminated for 3.2 hours and then held in the
dark for 3.2 hours?
One other thing that strikes me is that if the algae are neutrally buoyant and homogeneous
mixing is assumed, then why is the average cell depth less than 15 cm? Is this because of the
velocity profile and slower velocities near the bottom of the raceway? If so, the authors should
state as much.
Overall, this is an interesting paper outlining a framework for identifying light fluctuations in a
paddle-driven raceway. Of course, the authors note that assuming that the T for their model
applies to different flow rate is tenuous. Given that models are easily run, it would improve the
paper to run at least a couple more paddle-wheel speeds to demonstrate how T is impacted.
Identifying representative light exposure for raceways as a function of paddle-wheel speed is an
interesting research question that could lead to improved algae growth, but the authors should
note that a different raceway geometry would require a full reanalysis just like that presented in
this manuscript.
If the authors appropriately respond to the comments I have offered, the manuscript can be
published.

The paper titled “How do microalgae perceive light in a high rate pond? Towards more realistic
Lagrangian experiments” focus into the effect of light regime into the growth and acclimation of
Dunaliella cells. First the authors develop a simplified method to evaluate the light regime
prevailing in a small scale raceway reactor, then experiments are performed at the laboratory
providing this regime to the cells and including at higher and lower “frequencies”. The results
reveal different patterns in growth and pigments content as a function of light regime at which
the cells are exposed to, although a clear behaviour is not fully understand. The paper provide a
detailed analysis about the problem of light regime calculation/measurement in real systems and
how to simulate it at laboratory scale. The topic of the paper is highly relevant and although the
scale of the reactor is not large, then the phenomena taking place including hydrodynamic can
largely modify at larger scale, the methodology and results here provided are useful to advance
on this field. It is especially noticeable that the authors perform the study for more or less long
term instead of short time experiments usually performed when developing experiments about
light regime influence on photosynthetic microorganisms. It is also relevant the conclusion about
the relevance of realistic light regime instead “artificial” light/dark cycles normally found in
literature. The only missing aspect of the paper is to relate the increase of energy consumption
with the enhancement of light regime due to virtual modification of period of light pattern.

Subject Editor Comments to Author:
One reviewer is generally positive but provided little review except a summary of the work. A
second reviewer was overall positive but raises some important issues about the design of the
work that must be addressed The third reviewer was more negative and provides a number of
substantial issues that likely require considerable revision.
The reviewers and editors also observe that the manuscript is not written in good idiomatic
English. Although it is readable, it is not without considerable effort. We ask the authors to have
their manuscript edited by a native speaker of English who can help to make their sentences more
direct, with less jargon and more plain expression of what is being done.
The reviewers overall think that if sufficiently improved the study may be publishable. Because
these revisions may take more time than the three weeks allowed with our "Revise" decision, it is
preferable to recommend a "reject and resubmit" decision at this time. Good luck with your
revisions, should you choose to resubmit, and thank you for considering RSOS.

Appendix A
Royal Society Open Science – Detailed answer to reviewers comments
Answer to Reviewer: 1
The manuscript considers an interesting aspect of the impact of light variation due to the
hydrodynamics in an algae-growth raceway. The paper is not well written, but I have included an
electronic markup suggesting improvements.
Answer: We are extremely grateful to Reviewer #1 for his detailed reading and his numerous
uggestions which strongly contributed to improve the paper quality. Most of the recommendations
were followed (also sometimes our English proof reader made different suggestions).
What concerns me the most is that contrary to all research with which I am familiar, the flashing light
effect actually decreased algae growth.
There is some confusion in the literature with the notion of flashing light, and the reference to which
his illumination mode is compared. Especially, sometimes the light dose between two light signals is
not constant. With constant dose (average light over several flashing periods), growth rate is indeed
known to be enhanced when light flash frequency increases, and optimal growth is obtained at
nfinite flashing frequency, i.e. continuous light (Combe et al. 2015). This well-known impact of the
lashing effect has been shown by many authors (among others Vejrazka et al., 2011, 2012; Sforza et
al., 2012; Abu-Ghosh et al., 2015, …). In a previous published study (Combe et al. 2015), we carried
out such experiment with the same strain (Dunaliella salina), using the same experimental device. In
his previous “standard” experiment, we clearly confirmed the growth enhancement when flashing
requency was increased. The very surprising result of our paper based on real trajectories is that this
eature does not seem to hold anymore for a realistic light signal. To make it clearer, now we have
eproduced our results (Combe et al. 2015) obtained previously in the same experimental device.
Similar responses for standard flashing light were obtained by other authors for other species, but
we think that presenting our own results in standard conditions (which are presented in Combe et al.
2015) ) clearly better demonstrates the unexpected behaviour we have recorded. The following
graph, extracted from Combe et al. (2015) was then included in Supplementary Information SI.2.
Figure from the work of Combe et al. 2015, obtained with the same experimental set-up BUT
tandard light/dark cycles.
What else is unusual is that subjecting algae to continuous light is quite detrimental to their growth
because they have no opportunity to recover from oxidative stress, which is done when it is dark.
So, it is never a good idea to grow algae in continuous light and switching to long-period light
exposure should generally outperform continuous light exposure with regard to growth rate.
This might be true when comparing an on/off signal (with I0 at high light), with a continuous signal I0.
where I0 is a high photoinhibiting light level). Then, at high light the flashed signal can be more
efficient, indeed because LHC can recover during the dark phase. BUT in such a case, the light dose is
not identical (I0/2 in the first case, and I0 in the second case). For a constant light dose, continuous
ight (at least for this species) is the best option, as shown by Combe et al. 2015 but also by many
authors (Vejrazka et al., 2011, 2012; Sforza et al., 2012; Abu-Ghosh et al., 2015, …). This point is now
more extensively discussed in the manuscript.
Moreover, there is a notable nonlinearity in the measured growth rates where constant light yields
he highest growth rate, which is then minimum for the shortest period used, then increasing with
period, then decreasing, then increasing again with period.
As explained above, it was expected that continuous light yields the highest growth rate. This
nonlinearity was not observed for a simple on/off signal in the same experimental set-up and for the
ame strain. The strong nonlinearity that we observed in the growth rate is remarkable and has never
been descried before. But, as stated in the paper, it explains why enhancing agitation energy (and
hus increasing light/dark frequency alternation) has never been demonstrated to enhance growth
even if it is often cited as a dogma). We made it clearer now in this new version.
The authors claim "very replicable" experimental results. I have personally grown algae cultures in
riplicate in various conditions and never found the results to be "very replicable." I think it is
ncumbent on the authors to demonstrate what they mean by "very replicable" by presenting their
growth-rate data.
We do not fully agree on this statement. With our very strongly controlled environment we observed
very replicable results, even when restarting the experiment several times. The consistency of
various experiments is illustrated in the new Figure SI.8 presented in sup. Info. (and the related
variability information is also included in the standard deviations presented in all the graphs).

or the T/3 (blue) and the T/2 (magenta) conditions. Log scale (the slope is the growth rate).
The authors claim that the wild nonlinearity in growth rate as a function of light exposure period is
due to unexplained variations in photoacclimation and photoinhibition. Without seeing the growth-
ate data, I would suspect this to be much more likely due to experimental error.
The raw data have been added in suplementary info SI.8, Table SI.12 presents the standard deviation
associated to each condition. There are frequencies for which, clearly, algae do not succeed in
efficiently growing. Here we recall that, to our knowledge, there are no possible comparison with
other experiments where algae are submitted to such a realistic signal. We also refer to combe et al.
2015 to provide other clues that our experimental device offers reduced variability between different
essays.
The authors never explicitly describe the lightark ratios for the various periods studied. T=3.2 hours is
noted, but this is not an apparent result from Figure 3 where the period looks much shorter.
The notion of light/dark ratio is only relevant for on/off signals. Here, light is never exactly zero. But
we computed an index of “low to high light”. We added a paragraph at the end of Section 5.2.4 to
compare recommended step signals with the realistic paragon signal. “At first glance, the signal
plotted in Fig. 3.2 is rather similar to the recommended step signal computed in case C. The time
pent at high-light for the paragon –i.e. with a light intensity higher than p.I0 (where p=13.5%, as
defined in case C)– is 15.8%, which is coherent with 9.2% of time at low-light recommended for case
C.”
Remark that this ratio is kept constant among the different Langrangian experiments with variable
periods, since they result from a process of stretching the time window (accelerating or slowing
down the light signal).
Also, was the first hour of results discarded from this figure as noted in the modeling section? Does
T=3.2 hours mean that algae were illuminated for 3.2 hours and then held in the dark for 3.2 hours?
No, the signal was periodically repeated without dark phase to mimic a real light perceived by cells.
This has been made clearer now in the paper.
One other thing that strikes me is that if the algae are neutrally buoyant and homogeneous mixing is
assumed, then why is the average cell depth less than 15 cm? Is this because of the velocity profile
and slower velocities near the bottom of the raceway? If so, the authors should state as much.
ndeed, in theory, because of fluid incompressibility (see last paper section) average cell depth along
ong periods of time should be L/2 (L is the process depth). With the chosen time window (3.2
hours), the average depth is indeed lower than 15cm. But it was not possible, for experimental
easons, to further increase the time window over which the Lagrangian light is computed: When
dividing by 3 the agitation speed, now we end up with a 9.6h signal, to be periodically reproduced.
Less than 3 periods can be applied per day, and this is compatible with the exponential growth
period (3 days in general). If we double the light reconstruction period, then cells are exposed to less
han 5 light periods during exponential growth, and average growth rate on the period is likely to be
biased. We have now added a section in Supplementary Information SI 5 with statistical studies of
he generated trajectories. When considering enough trajectories (or equivalently a sufficient long
ime), the average depth is indeed L/2 (Figure SI 5.2) and standard deviation is also close to
heoretical value. With these additional elements we can demonstrate that ergodicity in the
momentum are kept. Note that, as stated above, from a light distribution point of view, we keep
properties in line with theoretical expectations. Also, we do believe that other attempts to
econstruct Lagrangian trajectories in other works did not succeed in keeping such sound statistical
properties.

At each time instant, the average distance (red curve) towards free surface +/- standard deviation

homogeneous distribution is achieved.
Overall, this is an interesting paper outlining a framework for identifying light fluctuations in a
paddle-driven raceway. Of course, the authors note that assuming that the T for their model applies
o different flow rate is tenuous. Given that models are easily run, it would improve the paper to run
at least a couple more paddle-wheel speeds to demonstrate how T is impacted.
Thanks for this very positive appreciation. We run several additional simulations, and in
Supplementary Information we have added simulations obtained with different paddle wheel
velocities. These graphs also make clearer the difficulty to compare two mixing regimes since
rajectories can be very different.
dentifying representative light exposure for raceways as a function of paddle-wheel speed is an
nteresting research question that could lead to improved algae growth, but the authors should note
hat a different raceway geometry would require a full reanalysis just like that presented in this
manuscript.
We fully agree on this point. Our study is only associated to a very specific (even if it is a standard)
aceway geometry. Changing the geometry will probably affect the results. We have added this point
n the discussion, and it also opens perspectives for optimization, while proposing geometries
enhancing growth.
Answer to Reviewer #2
consider that you made too many simplifications in your on going model, do not mention mesh
tatistics, and other CFD details that I think they should be considered or mentioned in your
publication.
n this new version we provide the reader with all the details related to the CFD and the innovative
approach which was carried out. Now we show in Supplementary Information SI.4 the used mesh,
and it becomes clearer that we run a 3D model. We also show that the time step has been chosen
uch that results become stable and are not changed when doubling the integration step. We also
provide more details (SI 3) on the advanced and more efficient approximation of Navier-Stokes
equations which is implemented (Allgeyer et al. 2017).

consider that a scientific publication should consider the full Navier-Stoke's equation, not the Saint-
Venant simplification.
We fully agree, and indeed we do consider full Navier-Stokes equation, as shown in Supplementary
nformation SI.3. We agree that the term “multi-layer Saint-Venant” is misleading, and hides the
actual use of an advanced discretization of the full Navier-Stokes equations, but with a more
powerful approach. The efficient way of discretizing Navier-Stokes which is used here and was
developed in Audusse et al. 2011a and 2011b was unfortunately called “multi-layer Saint-Venant”.
This approach offers more accurate numerical approximation of the 3D hydrostatic Navier-Stokes
ystem with free surface. In some simple cases, where analytical solutions can be computed, it has
been proved that numeric errors can be extremely low (Allgeyer et al. 2017). Also, the statistics on
he computed trajectories (see Supplementary Information SI 5.2) demonstrate that the approach
efficiently keep appropriate average and standard deviation for particle depth. This property is
known to be biased with other approaches such as numerical scheme embedded within Fluent.
More generally, the naming of the approach was corrected in the latest publications, and now the
authors do not refer anymore to the “multi-layer Saint-Venant” approach to avoid confusion with
Saint-Venant equations. We also accordingly modified the naming in the text.
Did you consider the density and viscosity modification of the biomass growth on time for your CFD
analysis
At the maximum, in these systems, 1g/l of biomass is reached. This means biomass represents less
han 0.1% of the fluid. Its effect on density and viscosity are therefore really small, which legitimates
o neglect them (standard hypothesis in the field).

Please, could you include a description of the computational mesh used?. Y+ information?.
Did you perform an independent mesh analysis to check the sensibility of your solution the
computational mesh?
The mesh is shown in Supplementary Information, Figure SI.4.1. The computation has converged
with the considered mesh (a more refined mesh has a marginal effect on results). This is now shown
on Figure SI.4.2 for 3 different meshes. Also, a remarkable point with our numerical approach
compared to other software also based on Navier-Stokes equations, is that it conserves some
tructural properties for the cell trajectories. In Supp Info SI.5 we show the average and variance
depth of the particles, and we show that it is an excellent approximation of the theoretical expected
values. This is another indirect validation of the accuracy of our numerical approach.

Did you analyze the influence of the number of lagrangian particles, a sensitivity analysis?.
This is a tricky question, since we had to choose one specific trajectory, that had thus to be selected.

Now we have included more trajectories of simulated particles. We have chosen to show most of

clarity, three trajectories are plotted, for three paddle wheel velocities to illustrate both the effect of
mixing regime and the marked difference between two trajectories.

Abstract
Hydrodynamics in a high -rate production reactor for microalgae cultivation affects the light
history perceived by cells. The interplay between cell movement and medium turbidity leads to a
complex light pattern, whose forcing effects on photosynthesis and photoacclimation dynamics are
not non-trivial to understand. The hydrodynamics. Hydrodynamics of high density algal ponds, mixed
by a paddle wheel, has recently been studied, but recently, although the focus has never with the
purpose of been on describing its impact on photosynthesisphotosynthetic growth efficiency. In the
present multidisciplinary downscaling study, we first reconstruct single cell trajectories in an open
raceway and experimentally reproduce using an original hydrodynamical model offering a powerfull
discretisation of the accordingNavier-Stokes equations tailored to systems with free surfaces. The
trajectory of a particular cell was selected and the associated high -frequency light pattern to observe
its effect on the growth of was computed. This light pattern was then experimentally reproduced in an
Arduino-driven computer controlled cultivation system with a low density Dunaliella salina. We

an unexpected photosynthetic response compared to that recorded under the on/off signals usually
used in the literature. Indeed, the light received by a single cell contains signals from low to high
frequencies that nonlinearly interact with the photosynthesis process and differentially stimulate the
various time -scales associated with photoacclimation and energy dissipation. This study highlights the
need for experiments with more realistic light stimuli in order to better understand microalgal growth
at high cell density. We also propose andensities. An experimental protocol is also proposed, with
simple piecewise constant, yet more realistic, step functions for light fluctuations.

1. Introduction
InOver recent years, biotechnological applications of microalgae have increased,
especiallyparticularly in the fields of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals orand agrofood (Milledge, 2011). The
main driver motivating these developments was the potential of some microalgae species in green
chemistry, and especially for supporting a large scale biofuel production (Chisti, 2007), with). This
emerging approach is also characterized by reduced environmental impactimpacts and enhanced
productivity compared to terrestrial plants. (Collet et al. 2015). Indeed, the aptitude of these
microorganisms to grow at high rates and to store large amounts of lipids have motivated substantial
research activities over the last decade (Wijffels and Barbosa, 2010).
The ratio ofbetween the energy produced overand the total energy involved (net energy ratio (NER))
is a key criterion when producing biofuel. The more it can be increasedhigher this ratio, the lower the
costs and the environmental footprint. ReducingAs energy consumption emits greenhouse gases
(GHG), the reduction of the energy demand is nowadaysremains a crucial challenge to make for
sustainable microalgae cultivation sustainable (Lardon et al., 2009), especially since energy
consumption emits greenhouse gases (GHG). Energy is required at different stages of the microalgal
production process (growth, harvesting, post-treatment), with highesta significant demand for mixing
processes during the microalgal growth phase, whichto ensure homogeneity and access to light. Two
different kinds of devices are used to grow microalgae at industrial scale: photobioreactorscales:
photobioreactors, which are closed systems with a short optical path andpaths that support high cell
densities (from 1 to 10 g.L-1), and the more basic, open raceway ponds, mixed by a paddle wheel,
associated with lower cell densitydensities (from 0.1 to 1 g.L-1) and). The latter are probably more
economical and are more widespread for large -scale algae production. In this paper, we focus on this
simpler and cheaperless costly system, which might be better adapted for biofuel and animal food
production (Benemann, 2013).
The benefit of mixing has been extensively discussed in the literature to: (i) to prevent cell
sedimentation, (ii) to ensure nutrient homogeneity, and (iii) to facilitate CO2 transfer and to remove
the, while removing excess oxygen in order to limit photorespiration and oxidative stress (Cuello et al.,
2014). HoweverMoreover, stirring also directly impacts light reception at the cell scale in a mixed
turbid environment (Perner-Nochta & Posten, 2007). A closer look atFocus on the cell scale shows that,
due to water motion, the light perceived by a cell iscells receive a rapid succession of light spikes,
reflecting the displacement of individual cells in the variable light field within the stirred culture system
(Fig. 1).

The critical interplay of (i) light absorption and diffusion at cell scale, (ii) cell density, and (iii) cell
advection, makescomplicates the dynamics of the light received at theby a single cell scale rather
complex.. Furthermore, the photosynthetic machinery processesway photons, captured by the
antennae, in a are processed by the photosynthetic machinery is both nonlinear dynamical way.and
dynamic (Han, 2001). The reaction centres excited by photons present significant de-excitation
dynamics. If they receive additional photons while still being excited, they get damaged, leading to a
decrease in efficiency (photoinhibition). Cells moderate the damaging impacts of high light through
(photoacclimation strategies,), by modulating their pigment content (Falkowski & Owens, 1980;
Falkowski & LaRoche, 1991). In particular, the cell content in synthesis of carotenoids, involved in the
xanthophyll cycle, is increased to enhance enhances a thermal dissipation of the excess energy (Lunch
et al., 2013). These so-called Non-Photochemical Quenching (NPQ) mechanisms were shown to be
highly dynamicalare dynamic and strongly influenced by the ratio of high light to low light (Abu-Ghosh
et al., 2015).
The impact of high frequency light fluctuationfluctuations on both photosynthesis and
photoacclimation is still poorlynot fully understood, but it appears to play an important role and could
be used to enhance productivity. It has been widely studied by many authors (Phillips & Myers, 1954;
Richmond & Vonshak, 1978; Laws, 1986; Grobbellar et al. 1996; Kim et al., 2006; Gordon & Polle, 2007;
Grobbelaar, 2010; Vejrazka et al., 2011, 2012; Sforza et al., 2012; Abu-Ghosh et al., 2015) on the basis
of a caricaturalsimple on/off experimental light signal. These studies describedworks describe how the
signal frequency affects photosynthesis: the increase of the faster dark/light alternation rate would
improve cycles increase photosynthetic efficiency of these organismsefficiencies and would therefore
allow for higher enhance growth rates. This improvement of theAmong these studies, Combe et al.
(2015) monitored the response of Dunaliela salina to simple light/dark cycles of increasing frequency.
They used the same strain in the same experimental set-up (see Material and Methods), resulting in
the typical response presented in Figure SI.2.1. Improvement in photosynthetic energy conversion in
response to the increase in higher flash frequency is often called the “ flashing light effect “ (Kok &
Burlew, 1953; Phillips & Myers, 1954; Kok, 1956; Terry, 1986). The work of Zarmi et al. (2013)
highlighted the dynamicaldynamic mechanisms involved in photon harvesting and use, represented
with mathematical models that take into accountconsider the damaging and repair mechanisms of
some key proteins in the photsyntheticphotosynthetic apparatus. Such models explain the yield
increase at higher frequencies, especially at high light.
Most of these works focused on photobioreactors, with time scales much fastershorter than a second.
In a raceway, light variations are slower and the accordingcommensurate acclimation processes have
not been muchwell studied (Combe et al., 2015). There is, however, an underlying inconsistency in the
literature dealing with photobioreactors and raceways. While numerous studies provide converging
evidence for an enhanced photosynthetic efficiency under increased rateshigher frequency of on/off
signals (Pruvost et al., 2006, Perner-Nochta & Posten, 2007), there is no clear experimental evidence
that more mixing actually enhances growth. Qiang and Richmond (1996) and Sobczuk et al. (2006)
studied different agitation velocities of a photobioreactor and observed a maximum cell density for
identified an optimal agitation rate for a maximum cell density, beyond which an increased stirring
negatively affected growth. To explain the decrease in productivity at higher agitation, the authors
mentioned shear stress and mortality due to the explosionbursting of small gas bubbles. Overall,
studies demonstrating a productivity enhancement bythrough increasing mixing rate are very scarce
compared to studies restricted onto the flashing effect only, and they are rarely supported by
experimental evidences. We foundTo the best of our knowledge, no work in the literature was
unambiguously supportingreported to support this dogma for raceway ponds in the literature. This
paper investigates the reason for this surprising mismatch between a theory apparently consistent
with many lab scale experiments and the industrial reality. To address this point, we first revisit the
classical caricatural approaches based on light signals that are far from actual patterns resulting from
both the paddle velocity and light fields. Overall, the coherency of the considered experimental light
signals with the light actually received by a cell has not been considered beyond its typical frequency.
The originality of the present work lies in the description of a more gradual light evolution, congruent
with the pond hydrodynamical properties. The objective of our study is to decipher the effect of the
mixing rate on photosynthesis, when considering a realistic light pattern..

of an ensemble of possible trajectories) was selected that representsidentified to represent a realistic

The observed response turned out to be more complex than what hadhas so far been reported in the
literature. We then discuss the experimental strategies required to study photosynthesis in more

2. Reconstruction of dynamicaldynamic light patterns using
hydrodynamicalhydrodynamic modelling
2.1 The hydrodynamicalhydrodynamic model
The dynamicsflow of thean incompressible water body in a raceway pond can beis accurately
described by the Navier-Stokes equations. However, in the case of for a raceway system, a, the
mathematical modellingmodel should also describeinclude the air-water interface. These so-
calledSuch free -surface systems are more difficult to representmodel and involve a higherincur

usually describedbeen investigated with the aim to predictgoal of predicting dead zones or to improve
the pond design in order to reduce thedesigns especially for lowering agitation costs (Hadiyanto et al.,
2013; Mendoza et al., 2013), whereas). However its impact on light access and biomass productivity
still remains a rather untouched topic. Most of works were carried outopen to study. Often, models
are built using a commercial software such as “Fluent”® which offers an automated schemeschemes
for the 3-D resolution of the Navier-Stokes equations. Given the numerical difficulties and the
computational cost to approximate the Navier-Stokes solutions with standard finite volume approach,
especially in the presence of a free-surface case, we use a recent approach based on a more
efficicentefficient discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations (Audusse et al., 2011b; Bernard et al.,
2013.). This multilayer model consists inapplies Galerkin-type approximations along the vertical axis of
the Navier-Stokes system. It results in yielding a set of partial differential equations with hyperbolic
features. The system iswas numerically solved by considering a 2D triangular mesh of the ground
surface, the layers defined byalong the water depth givinggive rise to the third spatial dimension., as
illustrated on Figure SI.4.1. This so-called multilayer Saint-Venant discretization of the Navier-Stokes
system with mass exchanges (Audusse et al., 2011b; Bernard et al., 2013) has demonstrated enhanced
accuracy and stability properties (Audusse et al. 2011a, 2011b).
Moreover, the multilayer model has been successfully confronted withverified against analytical
solutions of thefor hydrostatic Euler and Navier-Stokes systems with a free surface (Boulanger et al.,
2013). The discretization technique used a finite volume scheme based on a kinetic interpretation of
the equations. We also added a specific forcing term mimicking the effect of the paddle wheel (Bernard
et al., 2013). The impact of the paddle wheel on the fluid is consideredwas represented as a normalized
force applied by the wheel’s blade and equalblades proportional to the square of the velocity at each
point. Here, we used a 3D extension to the model presented inby Bernard et al. (2013) (Allgeyer et al.
2017).
WeA mesh was developed a mesh for the raceway pond ofin the Laboratory of Environmental
Biotechnology (LBE, INRA Narbonne) (Fig. 2) mixed with a paddle wheel (, Hreiz et al., 2014) (Fig. SI.4.1).

mesh (a more refined mesh has a marginal effect on results). In Supp. Info. SI.5. a momentum study is
carried out, with computation of average depth and variance for 64 particles. It demonstrates ergodic
properties for long enough periods of time and shows that the numerical scheme conserves some
structural properties of the trajectories. The raceway model iswas run for 4.2 hours and the first hour

2.2 Generation of Lagrangian trajectories and choice of a representative
paragon

field for various initial particle positions of the particles.. In addition, a Brownian motion model iswas
applied to better represent the local diffusion effecteffects (Bernard et al., 2013).

trajectory, (after discarding the first hour), knowing its layer i at time t, we built a transition matrix was
built by computing the probability for the particle to be at layer j at time t + dt. Then, aA
correspondence analysis was then carried out from this transition matrix. Based on the
correspondence analysis results, we differentiatedifferentiated four sets of trajectories by
doingperforming a hierarchical ascendant clustering (Ward classification with Euclidian distances) in
order to select athe group wherecontaining particles that explore the wholeentire water column. We
chose a paragon trajectory (Fig. 3) by calculating:The trajectory closest to the centroid of the cluster

This light pattern (shown in Figure 3) is the one3b was selected to be experimentally applied to the
microalgal culture in a photobioreactor. Different mixing rates could have been simulated with the
hydrodynamicalhydrodynamic model. However; however, comparing light patterns resulting from
various hydrodynamicalhydrodynamic regimes turns out to be very is complex, and the choice of
differenta specific trajectories eachtrajectory associated with a given mixing rate could make
thecomplicates results interpretation very uncertain.. Instead, we caricatured the effect of an increase
or decrease in the paddle wheel velocity was sketched by simply acceleratingspeeding up or slowing
down the initial trajectory, assuming that the hydrodynamicalhydrodynamic regime iswas not
structurally modified. This approach allows us to focus on frequency effects. The initial periodized
trajectory, with period T of 3.2 hours, was then accelerated (considering periods T/3 and T/2) or slowed
down (considering periods 2T and 3T). With this method, the daily light dose remains the same for all
conditions.
In this approach, we therefore focus on the frequency effect. The initial periodized trajectory, with
period T= 3.2 hours, was then accelerated (the considered periods were then T/3 and T/2) or slowed
down (the considered periods were then 2T and 3T).
This computational choice to reproduce several spinpaddle wheel velocities makes thefacilitates
comparison across experiments easier to compare, the . The downside beingof this is that nonlinear
effects in hydrodynamics when increasingwith increased mixing are not represented, whichand would
probably inducesintroduce biases in the light signal at the cell scale. . Energy dissipation for various
mixing regimes (and then different average fluid velocities) are presented on Figure SI.7.1.
3. Experimental set-up
The Chlorophyceae Dunaliella salina was grown axenically in an f/2 medium within cylindrical
double-walled glass photobioreactors with an effective capacity of 500 mL. The circulation of water
within their double walls Temperature was regulated the temperature at 27°C in the cultures.
Magnetic stirrers were used to homogenizehomogenized the cultures. Bubbling was providedinduced
with air filtered through a Whatman filter. Experiments were carried out with simultaneous culture
duplicates grown induplicate fed-batch. Cultures were cultures diluted with fresh sterile medium every
8 days.
Photobioreactors were illuminated with arrays of six white LEDs installed on a circular aluminium
frame. The LEDsLED drivers were controlled by an open-source electronics prototyping platform
Arduino Mega 2560 to generate the light patternpatterns. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)
was monitored in each photobioreactor during the experiments using a 2<U+F070> light sensor. The
differentDifferent light patterns were applied to the cultures, and an additional control was carried out
withusing a continuous light of equal mean irradiance (82.2 µmol.m-2.s-1).
The changes in algae population density and mean diameter were monitored twice a daydaily, in
triplicatestriplicate, using a Beckman Coulter Counter Beckman. Pigments were extracted from algae
with acetone and measured with a UV/Vis spectrophotometer. Carbon and nitrogen cell quotas were
determined with a CHN analyser after filtration onto pre-combusted GF/C filters (Whatman) with a
CHN analyser.). See Supplementary information (A)Information SI.1 for more details on the materials
and methods.
4. Results
4.1 Growth rate
The averageAverage growth rates (AGR) for the various light patterns are represented onin
Figure 4. In line with the experiment carried out with simple light/dark cycles (Combe et al. 2015, see
Figure SI.2), AGR obtained under continuous light is the highest. In particular, it is higher than that
measured with the T-paragon trajectory by 136%. A light/dark signal with shorter period is known to
stimulate photosynthesis and to induce higher growth raterates (Vejrazka et al., 2012; Combe et al.,
2015). We observe aA decrease in AGR with the signal period was observed from continuous
iluminationillumination to 2T, with the exception ofexcept for the fastest T/3-light signal that
surprisingly leadsled to a very weak biomass growth. This experiment was restartedrepeated three
times, but the results were eventually very replicable, as illustrated in Figure SI.8.1. There is also an
apparent paradoxical response for the signal with period 3T for which the growth rate is 55% higher
than with the T-paragon, while we expected it, on the basis of the literature supported by simple
light/dark cycles (Vejrazka et al., 2011, 2012; Sforza et al., 2012; Abu-Ghosh et al., 2015; Combe et al.

4.2 Acclimation mechanisms
Contrary to For realistic light signals, the previous results obtained for faster signal frequencies
reported in Combe et al. (2015),levels of chlorophyll a (Chl:C) and carotenoids (Car:C) per carbon
seemare affected by the changes in light pattern (Fig. 5).5). This observation is contrary to previous
results obtained for higher (on/off) signal frequencies reported by Combe et al. (2015). Indeed, cells
submitted to continuous light containcontained 65% more ChlChlorophyll a and 36% more
ChlChlorophyll b per biomass unit compared to cells exposed to the paragon. Carotenoids
showfollowed a similar pattern: cells under continuous illumination containcontained 92% more
carotenoids than the paragon, therefore pointing tosuggesting a different physiological reaction of
cells depending on the signallight frequency. There is, however, no clear linear relationship between
pigment content and the main period of the light signal over the set of tested conditions; it seems that
a minimal pigment content is expectedachieved for a light period in the range 3 to 6 hours.

could be carried out for T/3 due to the very low biomass in this culture).
Surprisingly theThe pigment content turns out to be strongly correlated with the growth rate
(Fig. 6) (R2=0.91, n=5). This relationship is classical for chlorophyll, due to its central role in
photosynthesis (at high light however, an excess of chlorophyll maycan trigger photoinhibition).
Nevertheless, it was expected that an increase in the photoprotectant pigments would reduce
thedecrease growth rate. Indeed, the role of the carotenoids (mainly ß-carotene for D. salina) consists
in dissipating the is to dissipate excess of energy and protecting the protect cells from free radicals
(Lamers et al., 2008). At low light, while still dissipating light energy, carotenoids are expected to
penalize growth. This drawback turns intois only an advantage at high light intensities, by protecting
the photosynthetic apparatus. SinceAs the light pattern consists ofwas above 300 µmol.m-2.s-1, for less
than 10% of the time with light above 300 µmol.m-2.s-1, , it is expected that the outcome of a high
carotenoid content is mainly detrimental to growth. Cells have therefore developed a dual strategy:
simultaneously increase the chlorophyll content for enhancing photon capture (low light acclimation)
and increase NPQ for excess energy to be rapidly dissipated during the highest illumination periods
(high light acclimation). This analysis therefore highlights a different type of acclimation strategy
depending on the signal period. The most efficient one is however obtained for higher chlorophyll and
carotenoids

A closer look at the Car:Chl a ratio clarifieselucidates the cell response (Fig.7). This ratio does
significantly changechanges (P<0.05) with the light period, showingpointing out that botheach pigment
classes are notclass was regulated at the samea different rate. More precisely, Fig. 6 reveals that AGR
increases faster with chlorophyll than with carotenoids. An increase faster thanin chlorophyll per
carbon unit (content is associated with higher carotenoids, and also per cell) with the average growth
rate, suggesting that the strategy consisting in thus higher photoprotection is more efficient., although
growth rate is eventually enhanced. This consolidates the finding of Abu-Ghosh et al. (2015), who
demonstrated, with simpler light signals, that photosynthesis was enhanced when photochemistry and
photoprotection were balanced. The xanthophyll cycles may actperform differentially for dissipating
energy especially during the high light exposure. We therefore conjecture that this unexpected
difference in cell photoacclimation explains partially explains the difference in growth rate and the
apparent inconsistency with the previous results for simplersimple light signals for which no marked
change in photoacclimation was observed (Combe et al. 2015).
The ratio Car:Chl has often beenratio can be considered as a stress indicator in this species (Young &
Beardall, 2003). SomeCertain signal periods could probably induced a higherinduce further cell stress,
resulting in significantly different growth rates. These observations need to be confirmed with
additional experiments, but they highlight the strong role played by the photoacclimation dynamics.
The mechanisms regulating the carotenoid and chlorophyll syntheses have not been totally elucidated
yet. The challenge now consists in discovering what, inhow the different light patterns, triggers trigger
different photoacclimation strategies. In the next paragraph, we more extensively analyse the
difference between the various light patterns.

5. Discussion
5.1 What drives photoacclimation?
These results, when considering a realistic signal, reveal a more complex response than what
has so far been reported under caricaturalsimple light patterns. The reconstructed trajectory is a
complex dynamicaldynamic signal embeddingcomprising several time scales whichthat are all
potentially resonate withrelevant to the different time scales of photosynthesis, photoprotection, and
photoacclimation. The fastesthighest frequencies are associated to the Brownian motion added to the
Lagrangian signal. At slowerlonger time scales, two key periodic events generate the observed
dynamics. FirstFirstly, each time a cell goes through the paddle wheel, it is rapidly advected and ends
up atto a different depth. The paddle wheel therefore clearly acts as the main process periodically
redistributing the cell depth and thus actively contributing to distributing light access between the
microalgae. When going through the paddle wheel, cells experimentexperience an abrupt light change
duringover up to 12 seconds on average. This rather long timeperiod is due to thea counter current
belowbeneath the paddle wheel, which that generates negative horizontal velocities. AHence, a cell
can therefore be trapped under the wheel before being released beyond the wheel. Secondfor a
certain amount of time. Secondly, and in addition to this phenomenon, cells goingtravelling through
the raceway bends also change depth, due to an helicoidal movementflow triggered by the horizontal
velocity gradient between faster trajectories along the external rim and slower, inner trajectories. (see
Supplementary Information SI.5). These two movements induce an inherent signalhave a period of 1.5
minutes (average time to accomplish a full revolution around the pond) for the paragon. Finally, it is
important to keep in mind that the signal peridiocity, T, is itself artificial since it results). Apart from
the periodisation process. The signal therefore period T, due to the cyclic repetition of the initial signal,
the light signal contains a mix of subfrequencies, all of which all may impact photosystems so asand
photoacclimation dynamics. It is possible that some of these time scales more strongly influence the
yield of photon harvesting and processing more intensively (Nikolaou et al. 2016). They also induce
different responses in the mechanisms of energy dissipation. Especially mechanisms. In particular, at
high light, the xanthophyll cycle is a way to dissipate the excess of lightdissipates photons through non-
photochemical quenching. For chlorophytes, the violaxanthin cycle (VC) isplays a key playerrole in
NPQ, exerting a photoprotective effect via thethrough accumulation of Zeaxanthinzeaxanthin, which
facilitates a thermal dissipation of the excessiveexcess light energy. As showndemonstrated for
Dunaliella salina by Abu-Ghosh et al. (2015), this process is highly dynamic, with anand its efficiency is
closely related to the light regime, in particular to the time ratio between high- and low lights-light
flashes. However, these acclimation mechanisms have generally been studied at rather fastshort time
scales (frequencies faster than 10Hz) occurring10 Hz) that occur in photobioreactors, whereas we are
considering here slower processes more typical of raceways dynamics. Modification of the xanthophyll
pool, is very likely to be affected by light fluctuations at a scale of several hours as it has been observed
for higher plants (Nichelmann et al. 2016). By acceleratingspeeding up or slowing down the signal, all
these frequencies have shiftedshift and some of them may eventually prove less (for the T/3-pattern)
or more (the 3T-pattern) efficient for photosynthesis. Beyond the signal frequency, the shape of the
signal itself impacts photosynthesis. When comparing, forFor a given frequency, schematic signals with
different time ratios of high and low light, the affect growth rate is also affectedrates (Combe et al.,
2015). However, these inherent signal properties are in theory not affected when
stretchinglengthening or contractingshortening the light signal, and more generally, neither the
average light nor its standard deviation do change.
While aA simple light/dark signal didhas not been shown to significantly affect photoacclimation
(Combe et al., 2015), but the response iswas different in our study. This unexpected behaviour when
a complex realistic signal is applied therefore reveals the effect of, suggests nonlinear processeseffects
on photosynthesis efficiency. More There is a need for more investigations are needed to better
understand and separate these different effects. To do so, experiments must be carried out using
simple light signals that inhertenly hold some key structural properties . These features are driven by
hydrodynamics that, and they are likely to trigger the mecanismsmechanisms underlying the responses
observed under realistic signals. In the following section, we discuss how a sketchysimple light pattern
shouldcan be designed that incorporatesfor incorporating these central physical properties.
5.2. Can we caricature the light pattern...with be more
realismrealistically sketched?
5.2.1 Light distribution in a perfectly mixed cultivation system
The mainprimary difference between the light pattern tested here and those reported so far
in the literature is the coherencycorrespondence of light distribution with hydrodynamics. Most of the
mechanically agitated systems generateyield a homogeneous cell distribution in space. Particle iso-.
Homogeneous particle distribution results from fluid incompressibility while cells are isodense
withhave the same density as water. However, in some cases, cells may not be iso-distributed along
the culturing device, where dead zones lead to local accumulation of sedimented particles which settle
down, locally increasing the particle density close totoward the bottom of the reactor. As a
consequence, cells are no longer equidistributed along depth. This behaviorbehaviour has been
numerically simulated, and some authors (James & Boriah, 2010; James et al., 2013; Hadiyanto et al.,
2013) proposed advanced designs to generate a fluid circulation avoiding this source of productivity
loss. Equidistribution is therefore targeted and reached with an efficient mixing system.
Simulating Lagrangian cell trajectories that observereflect this theoretical iso-distribution property is
verynumerically challenging from a numerical point of view. The numerical schemes used to compute
Lagrangian trajectories from Eulerian velocity fields do not keepmaintain these theoretical properties.
Especially, the "particleparticles rebound" on from the domain boundaries (free surface or bottom),
may generate an artificial local particle accumulation. This often leads to non-homogeneous
distributions whichthat must be artificially corrected (Perner-Nochta & Posten, 2007).
Now, assumingAssuming cell equidistribution meansyields a theoretical constant probability density
function (pdf) associated towith particle depth:
(2)
The probability density distributionpdf for light intensity, assuming a simple Beer-Lambert exponential
decrease (equation (1)) from the surface light intensity I0 to the intensity at the raceway bottom IL, can
be analytically derived from basic probability computation (Stirzaker, 2003):
(3)
where <U+03B7> denotes the remaining fraction of light at the bottom: <U+03B7> = IL/I0. where I0 is surface light
intensity and IL is the intensity at the bottom.
As a consequence, the light probability distributionpdf is a hyperbolic function that simply depends on
the fraction of light reaching the reactorraceway bottom. The average light in the reactor then
readssystem is:
(4)
The probability of a cell to receivereceiving a light intensity higher than a value Is can be computed
asis:
(5)
As a matter ofan illustration of this formula, if 1% of the light can still be founddetected at the reactor
bottom (<U+F068>=0.01), 50% of the reactor depth is illuminated with a light level larger than 10% of the
surface light. More generally 50% of the reactor is illuminated with a light intensity larger than v<U+0001D702><U+0001D43C>0 ,
and p% of the reactor is lightenedilluminated with a light intensity greater than <U+0001D702> <U+0001D45D>/100 <U+0001D43C>0 (for example,
for <U+F068>=0.01, 15% of the reactor is lightenedilluminated with more than 50% of the original flux).
5.2.2 Exact discretization into two layers does not exist
In most studies focusing on the flashing effect, light is often chosen as a very
schematic,represented with an oversimplified on/off signal. In the following we discuss the bestWe
offer a better option to sketchrepresent the light pattern, in agreement with light distribution,
assuming that the light source switches between two intensities. In this framework, each intensity
would representrepresents the average light in a two -layer discretization of the raceway. The main
challenge consistslies in determiningthe determination of the light intensities to be applied and of the
switching frequency for the caricature light to respect therepresent key properties of the light signal
at cell scale in a raceway.
Considering an upper euphotic layer of depth h with average light intensity IE, and a lower dark layer
with average light intensity ID, the question is to determinewe seek for a realistic probability (or
frequency, if a periodic light signal is required) for the cell to switch between these layers. Both layers
are characterized by their average irradiance. A desirable property would be to reconstruct a light
signal commutingswitching between IE and ID (i) inwith time proportions respectingto the probability
of a particle to be in each layer, (ii) with an average light intensity I for the overaloverall light signal
equal to the mean light intensity in the process, and (iii) with light intensities IE and ID compliantin
agreement with the average light distribution in each layer. Such a light pattern would ensure a first
level of coherencycorrespondence between the biological stimuli and the physics of the process.
We demonstrate (see the supplementary information, SI.C9) that such behaviour cannot be achieved
for a discretized water depth. Indeed, the average light when commutingswitching between IE and ID
at the rate p (p = h/L is the probability to be in the euphotic layer) cannot beis not the expected average
light, unless the lower layer has a zero thickness.
5.2.3 Variance computation
Instead of findingsearching for a framework representing the average light in each layer, we
rather seek for a criterion which may playthat plays a key role in the photosynthesisphotosynthetic
dynamics: the variance of the light signal. Indeed, light variance is also strongly constrained by the
medium homogeneity and by the light extinction rate. Computing thecoefficient. The theoretical light
variance based on the probability density function (pdf) of I is straightforward (see SI.D10):
(6)
It is worth remarkingnoting that the light variance is independent of the fluid velocity, but and depends
only on the light gradient through <U+F068>. This non -intuitive result meansimplies that the light variance is
not related to the complex hydrodynamicalhydrodynamic properties, which conveniently simplifies
the design of a realistic signal.
Now, if we considerconsidering a simple on/off light pattern oscillating between I0 and 0 at frequency
<U+0001D43C>¯ ¯ (<U+0001D43C>0 - <U+0001D43C> )¯ ) is obtained than the actual onethat given by
<U+0001D45D> = <U+0001D43C> (case A)), a much larger variance (<U+0001D43C>
0
equation (6). For example, for <U+03B7>w= 1%, the variance induced by a I0 -- 0light commutation between I0
and 0 is 2.7 times greater than the actual onevariance in the actual culture process.
We propose therefore an alternative strategy to synthesize simple, yet realistic light signals for
lab experiments. We relax the constraint (iii) on the realism of IE and ID, and we replace it by (iii.b)
imposing the, instead, impose a condition of light intensity variance in agreement with the actual :
(iii.b) variance <U+F06E> given by equation of light intensity according to (6). In this new framework, IE and ID
are no morelonger assumed to represent the average light intensity within the discretization
layerseach layer.
There are infinite possibilities to computecombinations of IE and ID once p has been chosen (see SI.E11);
in the following we proposeconsider two possibilitiesoptions: cells oscillating between IE and
obscuritydarkness (case B) or between I0 and ID (case C).
5.2.4 Alternative choice for caricatural signalsimple light patterns
Case B. Switching between IE and 0
In this case, the upper light signal is taken as IE.IE, lower than the surface light I0. This approach
is the simplest one sincebecause it corresponds to an on/off commutationsignal. Here:
(7)
The resulting light period is presented onin Figure 8 (case B), and the typical light pattern appears onin
Figure 9B.
Case C. Switching between I0 and ID
Here, the upper light signal is taken as I0. This approach is probably more relevant for
experimental studies targeting photoinhibition and stimulating the xanthophyll cycle sincebecause it
exposes cells to the highest light level they maymight encounter. In this option, ID is given as followsnot
zero and can be computed (see SI.E11):

xanthophyll cycles).
The resulting light period isperiods are presented onin Figure 8 (case C), and the typical light pattern
appears on is illustrated in Figure 9C. It is worth notingnoteworthy that this approach generates
duration of yields longer darker periods longer than what isare generally carried outstudied in classical
light/dark experiments (case A). AdditionallyIn addition, the use of low light (and not zero) is probably
more representative of real conditions, and may have an impact in terms of physiological response. It
is different from total darkness since it maintains a minimal photosynthetic activity and ensures a
minimal level of oxygen in the cell.
5.3 Towards
Finally, we compare these step signals with the realistic paragon signal computed in Section 2.3 and
experimentally applied to the culture. At first glance, the signal plotted in Fig. 3.2 is rather similar to
the recommended step signal computed in case C. The time spent at high-light for the paragon –i.e.
with a light intensity higher than p.I0 (where p=13.5%, as defined in case C)– is 15.8%, which is coherent
with 9.2% of time at low-light recommended for case C.
5.3 Toward realistic experiments
Lagrangian simulation is clearly the ideal an appropriate route to downscale experiments onstudying
the effecteffects of mixing on the efficiency of photon use. Even ifthough such a framework requires
a complex experimental set-up and makesrenders experiments more difficult to run, combining fast
light variations (at the scale of seconds) towith long -term experiments (at the scale of weeks) to
account for cell photoacclimation isremains of utmost importance. Better numerical schemes are
expected to more accurately reconstruct the Lagrangian trajectory with higher fidelity to the Navier-
Stokes equationsfidelity. Also, advanced nonlinear optics describing light fields in a multidiffusive
environment are expected tomay more accurately represent light distribution. The key challenge to
decipher the link between productivity and mixing energy is to reconstruct the light pattern for
different mixing intensities. In Supplementary Information SI.7, we show that the dissipated energy is
multiplied by 5.4 when the average fluid velocity is increased from 0.15 m.s-1 to 0.3 m.s-1. According
to our experimental study, it is clear that this large increase in energy demand is not compensated by
a larger productivity, and can even become counter productive.
As demonstrated in this work, the Lagrangian patterns mustshould have inherent theoretical
properties (average light, standard deviation) independent of the hydrodynamicalhydrodynamic
regime. To date, no numerical model guaranties these properties when considering various mixing
regimes. Using relevantly designed light signalsignals will thus contribute to better understand
photosynthesis and NPQ in realistic conditions, provided that the high to low light exposure ratio is
appropriately tuned with respect to the optical depth. Finally, it must be emphasized that simple step
signals are generic and rather independent from the geometry of the process, while a Lagrangian-
derived light pattern is tailored to a specific process, and associated to a mixing regime. Modifying
the process geometry or the mixing intensity affects cell trajectories and eventually the light pattern.
The Lagrangian trajectories should thus be recomputed for any change in the system. The cost for
setting up the numerical simulation, and for adapting it to new conditions are then the limit of the
approach.
7. Conclusion
Experiments usually carried outperformed with caricature piecewise constant representative
on/off light intensitysignals for studying the flashing effect in a dense culture are generally not
coherentconsistent with the real physics. ThereIt is no possibilityimpossible to chooseselect an
appropriate combination between two light intensities while respecting some key physical principles.
In this approach, the frequency of alternation between high and low light is both related to theboth
an underlying space discretization into layers and to the average fluid velocity. Reconstructing a
realistic light pattern throughusing a Lagrangian approach is, therefore, of the utmost importance for
downscaling a real process. Withprocesses. Using this approach, microalgae in a laboratory
environmentenvironments experience similar conditions asto those in an industrial process.
Suchprocesses. Corresponding experiments forgrowing Dunaliella salina revealed complex behaviours,
differingdifferent from previous on/off experiments and, which arecan not be explained by classical
models. The trade-off between photosynthesis and photoprotection, through photoacclimation,
seems to be triggered differently depending onaccording to the light signal period. MoreFurther
studies are therefore needed to understand the intracellular regulation mechanisms whichthat appear
in these highly variable environments. The chlorophyll content proved to be highly dependant
ondependent upon the rate of light changevariation, and thus on fluid velocity. If such a result is
confirmed, there is an optimal agitation rate must exist, for whichthat can maximize growth is
enhanced. Experiments in high -density cultures should nowcould confirm these findings. This study
highlights the original benefitbenefits of a multidisciplinary approach, where improving improvement
of the fluid dynamics modelling will leadleads to a new generation of experiments emphasizing
newunexplored acclimation mechanisms.

SI. 1. Detailed materials and methods
Culture conditions. The Chlorophyceae Dunaliella salina was obtained from the Culture Collection of
Algae and Protozoa (CCAP 18/19). The strain was grown axenically in an f/2 medium within cylindrical
(diameter 77mm) double-walled borosilicate glass photobioreactors with an effective capacity of 500
mL (SCHOTT DURAN). The circulation of water within their double walls regulated the temperature at
27°C in the cultures. Magnetic stirrers were used to homogenize the cultures. Bubbling was provided
with air filtered through a Whatman filter (0.2 <U+F06D>m). Experiments were carried out with simultaneous
culture duplicates grown in fed-batch. Cultures were diluted with fresh sterile medium every 8 days.
Only 10 to 15% of the initial volume was kept, in order to restart cultures with an initial cell density of
5.104 cell.mL-1.
Light supply system. Photobioreactors were illuminated with arrays of six white LEDs (Led SmartArray,
12x Nichia LEDs, 6W, Lumitronix) installed on a circular aluminium frame. The LEDs drivers (LPF-60D-
36, Meanwell) were controlled by an open-source electronics prototyping platform Arduino Mega
2560 to generate the light pattern. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was monitored on five
positions in each photobioreactor during the experiments using a 2<U+F070> light sensor (Biospherical
Instruments QSL-100). Light intensity at these five locations differed by less than 5% and was stable
along the experiments.
The different light patterns were applied to the cultures, and an additional control was carried out with
a continuous light of equal mean irradiance (82.2 µmol.m-2.s-1).
The maximum irradiance in the culture system was meadured with a 2<U+F070> light sensor placed in a
photobioreactor filled with medium. After correcting this signal relative to algal biomass, we
considered this estimation as I0.
Cell population, cell size. After inoculation, the changes in population density and mean diameter were
monitored daily (twice a day),, in triplicates, using a Coulter Counter Beckman (Multisizer 3) with a 50
µm aperture tube. The cell suspension was diluted with filtered (0,.2 µm) seawater (38 g.L-1), to obtain
adequate cell concentration. For each experimental condition, the specific average growth rate (µ, day-
1
) was estimated, during the exponential phase, from cell counts (X cells mL-1) taken at 24 h intervals,
according to). A linear regression was carried out between time and natural logarithm of cell density,
and the following relation: slope was the average growth rate.
ln(<U+0001D44B><U+0001D461>2<U+2061> ) - ln(<U+0001D44B><U+0001D461>1 )
µ=
<U+0001D461>2<U+2061> - <U+0001D461>1
where Xt is the cell density at time t; t1 and t2 are two consecutive days.
Pigment analysis. Pigments were extracted from algae from the first second day on. Samples of 3 mL
cell suspension were daily taken from the reactors and transferred to 10 mL tubes wrapped with
aluminium paper. For the extraction, 6 mL of 90% acetone were added in each tube, immediately
stored during 1 hour at -20 °C. Cells were precipitated by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes.
Absorbance was measured in duplicate at 470 nm, 644.80 and 661.60 nm corresponding to absorption
maxima of carotenoids, chlorophyll b and chlorophyll a respectively (Lichtenthaler, 1987), with a
UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, US/VIS, Lambda 2). Concentrations of chlorophyll a (Ca),
chlorophyll b (Cb) and of total carotenoids (Cx+c) (µg.mL-1) were calculated from the equations according
to Lichtenthaler (1987).
Elemental stoichiometry. Carbon and nitrogen cell quotas (pmol.cell-1) were determined once a day
from the 4th day on. Samples (6.8 mL) were first filtered onto pre-combusted (4h at 450°C) GF/C filters
(Whatman) and then dried at 60°C before analysis with a CHN analyser (2400 Series II CHNS/O - Perkin
Elmer). Nitrogen (pmol-N.cell-1) and carbon (pmol-C.cell-1) cell contents were estimated using the cell
abundance measured at the time of sampling.
We used a 2<U+F070> light sensor (Biospherical Instruments QSL-100) placed in a photobioreactor filled with
medium to estimate the maximum irradiance in the culture system. After correcting this signal relative
to algal biomass, we consider this estimation as I0.

SI. 2. Response of Dunaliella salina to simple light/cycles
The following figure is extracted from the study of Combe et al. (2015), with the same experimental
set-up and the same strain of Dunaliella salina (CCAP 18/19). This graph is reproduced here to recall
the “standard” response to simple on/off light cycle of increasing frequency. It also demonstrates
that the authors recorded the expected behavior, consistent with the vast literature, in this classical
approach.
Figure SI.2.1. Typical growth rates for Dunaliella salina measured by Combe et al. 2015,
with the same Arduino based experimental set-up but usual square light/dark cycles. Most of
the experiments were carried out with the same light and dark duration, except the two
experiments identified in green and red. Comparison with continuous light is also shown.
SI. 3. Multi-layer discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations
The Navier-Stokes equations consist in three set of equations. The first represents mass
conservation. The second one is the momentum and the third is the energy balance. This system is
solved according to the following boundary conditions: <U+0001D461> > <U+0001D461>0 , x <U+2208><U+2061> R, and
<U+0001D467><U+0001D44F><U+2061> (<U+0001D465>) = <U+0001D467><U+2061> = <U+F068>(<U+0001D465>, <U+0001D461>), with <U+F068>(<U+0001D465>, <U+0001D461>) the free surface elevation, <U+0001D462> = (<U+0001D462>, <U+0001D464>)<U+0001D447> the velocity vector,
<U+0001D45D>(<U+0001D465>, <U+0001D467>, <U+0001D461>) the pressure, <U+0001D454> the gravity and <U+0001D70C>(<U+0001D447>) the water density. The components of the wheel’s force
are described by <U+0001D439><U+0001D465><U+2061> (<U+0001D465>, <U+0001D467>, <U+0001D461>) and <U+0001D439><U+0001D467><U+2061> (<U+0001D465>, <U+0001D467>, <U+0001D461>). Hence the water height is <U+0001D43B> = <U+F068> - <U+0001D467><U+0001D44F> . The equations are
integrated on the water height and only the average horizontal velocity is considered in each layer for
the Saint-Venant multilayer approach.
C. To approximate the numerical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, a Galerkin type
approximation of the velocity field with piecewise constant basis functions was used in order to obtain
an accurate description of the vertical profile of the horizontal velocity. Such a strategy has several
advantages (Allgeyer et al. 2017), and allows to:
<U+F0B7> rewrite the Navier-Stokes equations under the form of a system of conservation laws
with source terms,
<U+F0B7> easy handle the free surface, which does not require moving meshes,
<U+F0B7> take advantage of robust and accurate numerical techniques developed for Shallow
Water type systems.
In the new formulation, the model admits a kinetic interpretation, and leads to a robust finite volume
scheme.

approach, the horizontal mesh is fixed and the vertical mesh varies with the (local) water level. The

time simulation run. From right to left the mesh contains 4965, 10455 and 18300 nodes, respectively.

nodes presents a sound trade-off between accuracy and computation time.

SI. 9. Computation of average light and probability to be in a layer
The average light in the upper euphotic layer IE can be computed as follows (Ih is the light at
depth h, the bottom of the euphotic zone):
(9)
1 <U+0001D43C> 1 <U+0001D43C> <U+0001D43C>h
Now, from Equation (1): <U+2061>ln <U+0001D43F> = ln h . Since <U+0001D45D> = h/<U+0001D43F>, we have = <U+F068><U+0001D443>
<U+0001D43F> <U+0001D43C>0 h<U+2061> <U+0001D43C>0 <U+0001D43C>0
(10)
and likewise:
(11)
Now, the average light value, when commuting between IE and ID can be computed as follows:
(12)
As a consequence, the average light equation yields:
(13)
which reduces to:
(14)
The right hand side is an increasing function of <U+0001D45D>, while the left hand side is a decreasing function. The
trivial solution <U+0001D45D> = 1 is thus the only one.
This shows that commuting between two light intensities representing the average light in the two
layers cannot generate the actual average light.
SI. 10. D. Computation of the signal variance
The variance associated to an average light is given by:
(15)
Thus,
(16)
Using equation (IV-2) giving the expression of average light, we get:
(17)
SI. 11. E. Constraining the lightLight pattern variance
Assuming a light pattern commuting between IE and ID such that
• The average value is <U+0001D43C>:
(18)
• The variance is <U+F06E>:
(19)
Equation (19) can be rewritten:
(20)
Finally, the average-variance (18) and (20) can be rewritten:
(21)
where and
This system of two equations has three unknowns (<U+0001D45D>, <U+0001D43C><U+0001D438> , <U+0001D43C><U+0001D437><U+2061> ).
i. System resolution in the case <U+0001D43C><U+0001D437> = 0
Assuming <U+0001D43C><U+0001D437> = 0, the system becomes simpler:
(22)
The solution is therefore:
(23)
This means:
(24)
ii. System resolution for <U+0001D43C><U+0001D438><U+2061> = <U+0001D43C>0
The system is now:
(25)
The first equation yields:
(26)
which can be injected in the second equation, leading to:
(27)
whose solution is:
(28)
Finally, we have:

Abstract
Hydrodynamics in a high-rate production reactor for microalgae cultivation affects the light
history perceived by cells. The interplay between cell movement and medium turbidity leads to a
complex light pattern, whose forcing effects on photosynthesis and photoacclimation dynamics are
non-trivial. Hydrodynamics of high density algal ponds mixed by a paddle wheel has been studied
recently, although the focus has never been on describing its impact on photosynthetic growth
efficiency. In this multidisciplinary downscaling study, we first reconstructed single cell trajectories in
an open raceway using an original hydrodynamical model offering a powerfull discretisation of the
Navier-Stokes equations tailored to systems with free surfaces. The trajectory of a particular cell was
selected and the associated high-frequency light pattern was computed. This light pattern was then
experimentally reproduced in an Arduino-driven computer controlled cultivation system with a low
density Dunaliella salina culture. The effect on growth and pigment content was recorded for various
frequencies of the light pattern, by setting different paddle wheel velocities. Results show that the
frequency of this realistic signal plays a decisive role in the dynamics of photosynthesis, thus revealing
an unexpected photosynthetic response compared to that recorded under the on/off signals usually
used in the literature. Indeed, the light received by a single cell contains signals from low to high
frequencies that nonlinearly interact with the photosynthesis process and differentially stimulate the
various time-scales associated with photoacclimation and energy dissipation. This study highlights
highlights the need for experiments with more realistic light stimuli to better understand microalgal
growth at high cell densities. An experimental protocol is also proposed, with simple, yet more realistic,
step functions for light fluctuations.

1. Introduction
Over recent years, biotechnological applications of microalgae have increased, particularly in the
fields of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and agrofood (Milledge, 2011). The main driver motivating these
developments was the potential of some microalgae species in green chemistry, and especially for
supporting large scale biofuel production (Chisti, 2007). This emerging approach is also characterized
by reduced environmental impacts and enhanced productivity compared to terrestrial plants (Collet
et al. 2015). Indeed, the aptitude of these microorganisms to grow at high rates and to store large
amounts of lipids have motivated substantial research activities over the last decade (Wijffels and
Barbosa, 2010).
The ratio between the energy produced and the total energy involved is a key criterion when producing
biofuel. The higher this ratio, the lower the costs and environmental footprint. As energy consumption
emits greenhouse gases (GHG), the reduction of the energy demand remains a crucial challenge for
sustainable microalgae cultivation (Lardon et al., 2009). Energy is required at different stages of the
microalgal production process (growth, harvesting, post-treatment), with a significant demand for
mixing processes during the microalgal growth phase, to ensure homogeneity and access to light. Two
different kinds of devices are used to grow microalgae at industrial scales: photobioreactors, which are
closed systems with short optical paths that support high cell densities (from 1 to 10 g.L-1), and more
basic raceway ponds, mixed by a paddle wheel, with lower cell densities (from 0.1 to 1 g.L-1). The latter
are probably more economical and are more widespread for large-scale algae production. In this paper,
we focus on this less costly system, which might be better adapted for biofuel and food production
(Benemann, 2013).
The benefit of mixing has been extensively discussed in the literature to: (i) prevent cell sedimentation,
(ii) ensure nutrient homogeneity, and (iii) facilitate CO2 transfer, while removing excess oxygen to limit
photorespiration and oxidative stress (Cuello et al., 2014). Moreover, stirring also directly impacts light
reception at the cell scale in a mixed turbid environment (Perner-Nochta & Posten, 2007). Focus on
the cell scale shows that, due to water motion, cells receive a rapid succession of light spikes, reflecting
the displacement of individual cells in the variable light field within the stirred culture system (Fig. 1).

The critical interplay of (i) light absorption and diffusion scattering at cell scale, (ii) cell density, and (iii)
cell advection, complicates the dynamics of the light received by a single cell. Furthermore, the way
photons captured by the antennae are processed by the photosynthetic machinery is both nonlinear
and dynamic (Han, 2001). The reaction centres excited by photons present significant de-excitation
dynamics. If they receive additional photons while still being excited, they get damaged, leading to a
decrease in efficiency (photoinhibition). Cells moderate the damaging impacts of high light
(photoacclimation), by modulating their pigment content (Falkowski & Owens, 1980; Falkowski &
LaRoche, 1991). In particular, the synthesis of carotenoids involved in the xanthophyll cycle enhances
a thermal dissipation of excess energy (Lunch et al., 2013). These so-called Non-Photochemical
Quenching (NPQ) mechanisms are dynamic and strongly influenced by the ratio of high to low light
(Abu-Ghosh et al., 2015).
The impact of high frequency light fluctuations on both photosynthesis and photoacclimation is not
fully understood, but appears to play an important role and could be used to enhance productivity. It
has been studied by many authors (Phillips & Myers, 1954; Richmond & Vonshak, 1978; Laws, 1986;
Grobbellar et al. 1996; Kim et al., 2006; Gordon & Polle, 2007; Grobbelaar, 2010; Vejrazka et al., 2011,
2012; Sforza et al., 2012; Abu-Ghosh et al., 2015) on the basis of a simple on/off experimental light
signal. These works describe how the signal frequency affects photosynthesis: faster dark/light cycles
increase photosynthetic efficiencies and enhance growth rates. Among these studies, Combe et al.
(2015) monitored the response of Dunaliella salina to simple light/dark cycles of increasing frequency.
They used the same strain in the same experimental set-up (see Material and Methods), resulting in
the typical response presented in Figure SI.2.1. Improvement in photosynthetic energy conversion in
response to higher flash frequency is often called the “flashing light effect”“ (Kok & Burlew, 1953;
Phillips & Myers, 1954; Kok, 1956; Terry, 1986). The work of Zarmi et al. (2013) highlighted the dynamic
mechanisms involved in photon harvesting and use, represented with mathematical models that
consider the damaging and repair mechanisms of some key proteins in the photosynthetic apparatus.
Such models explain the yield increase at higher frequencies, especially at high light.
Most of these works focused on photobioreactors with time scales much shorter than a second. In a
raceway, light variations are slower and the commensurate acclimation processes have not been well
studied (Combe et al., 2015). There is, however, an underlying inconsistency in the literature dealing
with photobioreactors and raceways. While numerous studies provide converging evidence for an
enhanced photosynthetic efficiency under higher frequency of on/off signals (Pruvost et al., 2006,
Perner-Nochta & Posten, 2007), there is no clear experimental evidence that more mixing actually
enhances growth. Qiang and Richmond (1996) and Sobczuk et al. (2006) studied different agitation
velocities of a photobioreactor and identified an optimal agitation rate for a maximum cell density,
beyond which increased stirring negatively affected growth. To explain the decrease in productivity at
higher agitation, the authors mentioned shear stress and mortality due to the bursting of small gas
bubbles. Overall, studies demonstrating productivity enhancement through increasing mixing are
scarce compared to studies restricted to the flashing effect only, and they are rarely supported by
experimental evidences. To the best of our knowledge, no work in the literature was unambiguously
reported to support this dogma for raceway ponds.
This paper investigates the reasons for theis surprising mismatch between a theory apparently
consistent with many lab-scale experiments and the industrial reality. To address this point, we first
revisited the typical approaches based on light signals that are far from actual patterns resulting from
paddle wheel velocity and light field. Overall, the correspondence between experimental light signals
and light actually received by a cell has not been considered. The originality of the present work lies in
the consideration of a more gradual light evolution, congruent with the pond hydrodynamic
properties. The objective of this study is therefore to identify the effect of the mixing rate on
photosynthesis, under realistic light pattern conditions.
Our multidisciplinary approach begins with a downscaling viewpoint. A realistic light signal was
reconstructed, using a hydrodynamic model that simulates Langrangian cell trajectories. These
dynamic light patterns were then analysed. The so-called “paragon” (a specific cell trajectory
representative of an ensemble of possible trajectories) was identified to represent a realistic light
signal. A microcontroller-platform-based experimental device was then developed to expose a low-
density population of microalgae to this light signal. By maintaining cultures at a low density, any self-
shading was limited, ensuring that all cells in the experimental vessel received similar light levels. The
population behaviour was thus homogenous and reflected the state of a single cell. The experiments
were carried out on a sufficiently long timeframe so that photoacclimation could take place and its
dynamics could be studied. The observed response turned out to be more complex than what has so
far been reported in the literature. We then discuss the experimental strategies required to study
photosynthesis in more realistic conditions, including more realistic light stimuli with simple step
functions.
2. Reconstruction of dynamic light patterns using hydrodynamic
modelling
2.1 The hydrodynamic model
The flow of an incompressible water body in a raceway is accurately described by the Navier-
Stokes equations. However, for a raceway, the mathematical model should also include the air-water
interface. Such free-surface systems are more difficult to model and incur additional computational
costs. Hydrodynamics in a raceway pond have usually been investigated with the goal of predicting
dead zones or to improve pond designs especially for lowering agitation costs (Hadiyanto et al., 2013;
Mendoza et al., 2013). However its impact on light access and biomass productivity still remains open
to study. Often, models are built using commercial software such as Fluent® which offers automated
schemes for 3-D resolution of the Navier-Stokes equations. Given the numerical difficulties and the
computational cost to approximate the Navier-Stokes solutions with standard finite volume approach,
especially in the presence of a free-surface, we use a recent approach based on a more efficient
discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations (Audusse et al., 2011b; Bernard et al., 2013). This
multilayer model applies Galerkin-type approximations along the vertical axis of the Navier-Stokes
system yielding a set of partial differential equations with hyperbolic features. The system was
numerically solved by considering a 2D triangular mesh of the ground surface, the layers along the
water depth give rise to the third spatial dimension, as illustrated on Figure SI.4.1. This multilayer
discretization of the Navier-Stokes system with mass exchanges has demonstrated enhanced accuracy
and stability (Audusse et al. 2011a, 2011b).
Moreover, the multilayer model has been successfully verified against analytical solutions for
hydrostatic Euler and Navier-Stokes systems with a free surface (Boulanger et al., 2013). We also
added a specific forcing term mimicking the effect of the paddle wheel (Bernard et al., 2013). The
impact of the paddle wheel on the fluid was represented as a normalized force applied by the wheel’s
blades proportional to the square of the velocity at each point. Here, we used a 3D extension to the
model presented by Bernard et al. (2013) (Allgeyer et al. 2017).
A mesh was developed for the raceway pond in the Laboratory of Environmental Biotechnology (LBE,
INRA Narbonne, Hreiz et al., 2014) (Fig. SI.4.1). The water-column depth (0.3 m) was divided into 20
horizontal layers. The simulation started with a static non-agitated medium, and the paddle wheel was
instantaneously turned on. In Figure SI.4.2, we demonstrate that the computation has converged with
the this considered mesh (a more refined mesh has a marginal effect on results). In Supp. Info. SI.5. a
momentum study is was carried out, with computation of average depth and variance for 64 particles.
It demonstrates demonstrated ergodic properties for sufficiently long enough periods of time and
shows showed that the numerical scheme conservesd some structural properties of the trajectories.
The raceway model was run for 4.2 hours and the first hour of simulation was discarded in order to
reach a stabilized regime. The velocity field together with a single cell trajectory is shown in Fig. 2.

velocity field (m.s-1). Several particular trajectories are also shown.
2.2 Generation of Lagrangian trajectories and choice of a representative
paragon
Lagrangian trajectories of 10 000 particles were reconstructed by integrating the velocity field
for various initial particle positions. In addition, a Brownian motion model was applied to represent
local diffusion effects (Bernard et al., 2013).
The model was discretized into 20 layers. For each trajectory (after discarding the first hour),
knowing its layer i at time t, a transition matrix was built by computing the probability for the particle
to be at layer j at time t + dt. A correspondence analysis was then carried out from this transition
matrix. Based on the correspondence analysis results, we differentiated four sets of trajectories by
performing a hierarchical ascendant clustering (Ward classification with Euclidian distances) to select
the group containing particles that explore the entire water column. The trajectory closest to the
centroid of the cluster was determined, i.e. the trajectory which minimizes minimized the following
2
distance: <U+0001D466><U+0001D457> = <U+0001D45A><U+0001D456><U+0001D45B><U+2061>[(<U+0001D434><U+0001D457><U+2061> - <U+2061> <U+0001D434>) ] where Ai is the probability matrix of trajectory j, and A is the average
matrix probability of the particular group. The corresponding trajectory is was called the paragon
trajectory (Fig. 3) and represents represented a typical trajectory. The selected pattern was then
cyclically repeated to obtain a periodic trajectory with a period T of 3.2 hours. The light signal
associated to this periodized trajectory was then considered.
Figure 3: Depth (a) and light (b) pattern of the paragon trajectory.
Finally, the light received by the particle over time was computed, accounting for Beer-Lambert
exponential attenuation:
<U+0001D43C>(<U+0001D461>) = <U+0001D43C>0 exp<U+2061>(-<U+0001D458><U+0001D467>) (1)
where I0 is the light at the surface (here I0 = 850 µmol.m-2.s-1), k is the light extinction coefficient,
1 <U+0001D43C>0
computed from IL, the light at the bottom of the raceway (assuming here IL = 0.01 I0): <U+0001D458> = <U+2061> ln and
<U+0001D43F><U+2061> <U+0001D43C><U+0001D43F>
z is the depth of the particle at time t.
This light pattern shown in Figure 3b was selected to be experimentally applied to the microalgal
culture in a photobioreactor. Different mixing rates could have been simulated with the hydrodynamic
model; however, comparing light patterns resulting from various hydrodynamic regimes is complex,
and the choice of a specific trajectory associated with a given mixing rate complicates results
interpretation. Instead, the effect of an increase or decrease in paddle wheel velocity was sketched by
simply speeding up or slowing down the initial trajectory, assuming that the hydrodynamic regime was
not structurally modified. This approach allows allowed us to focus on frequency effects. The initial
periodized trajectory, with period T of 3.2 hours, was then accelerated (considering periods T/3 and
T/2) or slowed down (considering periods 2T and 3T). With this method, the daily light dose remains
remained the sameconstant for all conditions.
This computational choice to reproduce several paddle wheel velocities facilitates comparison across
experiments. The downside of this is that nonlinear effects in hydrodynamics with increased mixing
are not represented, and would probably introduce biases in the light signal. Energy dissipation for
various mixing regimes (and then different average fluid velocities) are presented on Figure SI.7.1.
3. Experimental set-up
The Chlorophyceae Dunaliella salina was grown axenically in f/2 medium within cylindrical
double-walled glass photobioreactors with an effective capacity of 500 mL. Temperature was
regulated at 27°C in the cultures. Magnetic stirrers homogenized the cultures. Bubbling was induced
with air filtered through a Whatman filter. Experiments were carried out with duplicate fed-batch
cultures diluted with fresh sterile medium every 8 days.
Photobioreactors were illuminated with arrays of six white LEDs installed on a circular aluminium
frame. The LED drivers were controlled by an open-source electronics prototyping platform Arduino
Mega 2560 to generate light patterns. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was monitored in each
photobioreactor during the experiments using a 2<U+F070> light sensor. Different light patterns were applied
to the cultures, and an additional control was carried out using a continuous light of equal mean
irradiance (82.2 µmol.m-2.s-1).
The changes in algae population density and mean diameter were monitored twice -daily, in triplicate,
using a Beckman Coulter Counter. Pigments were extracted from algae with acetone and measured
with a UV/Vis spectrophotometer. Carbon and nitrogen cell quotas were determined with a CHN
analyser after filtration onto pre-combusted GF/C filters (Whatman). See Supplementary Information
SI.1 for details on the materials and methods.
4. Results
4.1 Growth rate
Average growth rates (AGR) for the various light patterns are represented in Figure 4. In line
with the experiment carried out with simple light/dark cycles (Combe et al. 2015, see Figure SI.2), AGR
obtained under continuous light is the highest. In particular, it is higher than that measured with the
T-paragon trajectory by 136%. A light/dark signal with shorter period is known to stimulate
photosynthesis and to induce higher growth rates (Vejrazka et al., 2012; Combe et al., 2015). A
decrease in AGR with the signal period was observed from continuous illumination to 2T, except for
the fastest T/3-light signal that surprisingly led to a very weak biomass growth. This experiment was
repeated three times, but the results were eventually replicable, as illustrated in Figure SI.8.1. There is
was also an apparent paradoxical response for the signal with period 3T for which the growth rate is
was 55% higher than with the T-paragon, while, on the basis of the literature supported by simple
light/dark cycles (Vejrazka et al., 2011, 2012; Sforza et al., 2012; Abu-Ghosh et al., 2015; Combe et al.
2015), this slowest signal was expected to be the least favourable to growth.

In agreement with the results of Combe et al. (2015), intracellular carbon and nitrogen content
do did not significantly change across different conditions. Likewise, there is was no significant
difference in the C/N composition (P=0.22) between light treatments (data not shown).
4.2 Acclimation mechanisms
For realistic light signals, the levels of chlorophyll a (Chl:C) and carotenoids (Car:C) per carbon
are were affected by the changes in light pattern (Fig. 5). This observation is contrary to previous
results obtained for higher (on/off) signal frequencies reported by Combe et al. (2015). Indeed, cells
submitted to continuous light contained 65% more Chlorophyll a and 36% more Chlorophyll b per
biomass unit compared to cells exposed to the paragon. Carotenoids followed a similar pattern: cells
under continuous illumination contained 92% more carotenoids than the paragon, suggesting a
different physiological reaction of cells depending on the light frequency. There iswas, however, no
clear relationship between pigment content and the period of the light signal; it seems seems that a
minimal pigment content is was achieved for a light period in the range 3 to 6 hours.

function of T (no measurement could be carried out for T/3 due to low biomass).
The pigment content turns turns out to be strongly correlated with the growth rate (Fig. 6)
(R2=0.91, n=5). This relationship is classical for chlorophyll, due to its central role in photosynthesis (at
high light however, excess chlorophyll can trigger photoinhibition). Nevertheless, it was expected that
an increase in photoprotectant pigments would decrease growth rate. Indeed, the role of carotenoids
(mainly ß-carotene for D. salina) is to dissipate excess energy and protect cells from free radicals
(Lamers et al., 2008). At low light, while still dissipating light energy, carotenoids are expected to
penalize growth. This drawback is only an advantage at high light intensities, by protecting the
photosynthetic apparatus. As the light pattern was above 300 µmol.m-2.s-1, for less than 10% of the
time, it is expected that a high carotenoid content is detrimental to growth. Cells have therefore
developed a dual strategy: simultaneously increase the chlorophyll content for enhancing photon
capture (low -light acclimation) and increase NPQ for excess energy to be rapidly dissipated during the
highest illumination periods (high- light acclimation). This analysis highlights highlights a different type
of acclimation strategy depending on the signal period. The most efficient strategy was a tendency
toward one is however obtained for higher chlorophyll and carotenoids

) (no measurement could be carried out for T/3 due to low biomass).
A closer look at the Car:Chl a ratio elucidates the cell response (Fig.7). This ratio significantly changes
changed (P<0.05) with the light period, pointing out that each pigment class was regulated at a
different rate. More precisely, Fig. 6 reveals that AGR increases increased faster with chlorophyll than
with carotenoids. An increase in chlorophyll content wis as associated with higher carotenoids, and
thus higher photoprotection, although growth rate is was eventually enhanced. This consolidates the
finding of Abu-Ghosh et al. (2015), who demonstrated, with simpler light signals, that photosynthesis
was enhanced when photochemistry and photoprotection were balanced. The xanthophyll cycles may
perform differentially for dissipating energy especially during high light exposure. We therefore
conjecture that this unexpected difference in cell photoacclimation partially explains the difference in
growth rate and the apparent inconsistency with the previous results for simple light signals for which
no marked change in photoacclimation was observed (Combe et al. 2015).
The Car:Chl ratio can be considered as a stress indicator (Young & Beardall, 2003). Certain signal
periods could probably induce further cell stress, resulting in significantly different growth rates. These
observations need to be confirmed with additional experiments, but they highlight the role played by
the photoacclimation dynamics. The mechanisms regulating carotenoid and chlorophyll syntheses
have not been totally elucidated. The challenge now consists in discovering how the different light
patterns trigger different photoacclimation strategies.

5. Discussion
5.1 What drives photoacclimation?
These results, when considering a realistic signal, reveal a more complex response than what
has so far been reported under simple light patterns. The reconstructed trajectory is a complex
dynamic signal comprising several time scales that are all potentially relevant to the different time
scales of photosynthesis, photoprotection, and photoacclimation. The highest frequencies are
associated to the Brownian motion added to the Lagrangian signal. At longer time scales, two key
periodic events generate the observed dynamics. Firstly, each time a cell goes through the paddle
wheel, it is rapidly advected to a different depth. The paddle wheel therefore clearly acts as the main
process periodically redistributing the cell depth and thus actively contributing to distributing light
access between the microalgae. When going through the paddle wheel, cells experience an abrupt
light change over up to 12 seconds. This rather long period is due to a counter current beneath the
paddle wheel that generates negative horizontal velocities. Hence, a cell can be trapped under the
wheel for a certain amount of time. Secondly, and in addition to this phenomenon, cells travelling
through the raceway bends also change depth, due to helicoidal flow triggered by the horizontal
velocity gradient between faster trajectories along the external rim and slower, inner trajectories (see
Supplementary Information SI.5). These two movements have a period of 1.5 minutes (average time
to accomplish a full revolution around the pond). Apart from the period T, due to the cyclic repetition
of the initial signal, the light signal contains a mix of subfrequencies, all of which may impact
photosystems and photoacclimation dynamics. It is possible that some of these time scales influence
the yield of photon harvesting and processing more intensively (Nikolaou et al. 2016). They also induce
different responses in energy dissipation mechanisms. In particular, at high light, the xanthophyll cycle
dissipates photons through non-photochemical quenching. For chlorophytes, the violaxanthin cycle
(VC) plays a key role in NPQ, exerting a photoprotective effect through accumulation of zeaxanthin,
which facilitates a thermal dissipation of the excess light energy. As demonstrated for Dunaliella salina
by Abu-Ghosh et al. (2015), this process is highly dynamic, and its efficiency is closely related to the
light regime, in particular to the time ratio between high- and low-light flashes. However, these
acclimation mechanisms have generally been studied at short time scales (frequencies faster than 10
Hz) that occur in photobioreactors, whereas we are considering here slower processes typical of
raceways dynamics. Modification of the xanthophyll pool is likely to be affected by light fluctuations
at a scale of several hours as it has been observed for higher plants (Nichelmann et al. 2016). By
speeding up or slowing down the signal, all frequencies shift and some of them may eventually prove
less (for the T/3-pattern) or more (the 3T-pattern) efficient for photosynthesis. Beyond the signal
frequency, the shape of the signal itself impacts photosynthesis. For a given frequency, schematic
signals with different time ratios of high and low light affect growth rates (Combe et al., 2015).
However these inherent signal properties are not affected when lengthening or shortening the light
signal, and more generally, neither the average light nor its standard deviation change.
A simple light/dark signal has not been shown to significantly affect photoacclimation (Combe et al.,
2015), but the response was different in our study. This unexpected behaviour when a complex realistic
signal is applied, suggests nonlinear effects on photosynthesis efficiency. There is a need for more
investigations to better understand and separate these effects. To do so, experiments must be carried
out using simple light signals that inhertenly hold key structural properties. These features are driven
by hydrodynamics, and they are likely to trigger the mechanisms underlying the responses observed
under realistic signals. In the following section, we discuss how a simple light pattern can be designed
for incorporating these central physical properties.
5.2. Can the light pattern be more realistically sketched?
5.2.1 Light distribution in a perfectly mixed cultivation system
The primary difference between the light pattern tested here and those reported in the
literature is the correspondence of light distribution with hydrodynamics. Most of the mechanically
agitated systems yield a homogeneous cell distribution. Homogeneous particle distribution results
from fluid incompressibility while cells have the same density as water. However, in some cases, cells
may not be iso-distributed along the culturing device, where dead zones lead to local accumulation of
sedimented particles, locally increasing the particle density toward the bottom of the reactor. This
behaviour has been numerically simulated, and some authors (James & Boriah, 2010; James et al.,
2013; Hadiyanto et al., 2013) proposed advanced designs to generate fluid circulation avoiding this
source of productivity loss. Equidistribution is therefore targeted and reached with an efficient mixing
system.
Simulating Lagrangian cell trajectories that reflect this theoretical iso-distribution property is
numerically challenging. The numerical schemes used to compute Lagrangian trajectories from
Eulerian velocity fields do not maintain these theoretical properties. Especially, particles rebound from
the domain boundaries (free surface or bottom), may generate an artificial local particle accumulation.
This often leads to non-homogeneous distributions that must be artificially corrected (Perner-Nochta
& Posten, 2007).
Assuming cell equidistribution yields a constant probability density function (pdf) associated with
particle depth:
(2)
The pdf for light intensity, assuming a simple Beer-Lambert exponential decrease (equation (1)) can be
analytically derived (Stirzaker, 2003):
(3)
where <U+03B7> denotes the remaining fraction of light at the bottom: <U+03B7> = IL/I0 where I0 is surface light intensity
and IL is the intensity at the bottom.
As a consequence, pdf is a hyperbolic function that depends on the fraction of light reaching the
raceway bottom. The average light in the system is:
(4)
The probability of a cell receiving a light intensity higher than Is is:
(5)
As an illustration, if 1% of the light can still be detected at the reactor bottom (<U+F068>=0.01), 50% of the
reactor depth is illuminated with a light level larger than 10% of the surface light. More generally 50%
of the reactor is illuminated with a light intensity larger than v<U+0001D702><U+0001D43C>0 , and p% of the reactor is illuminated
with a light intensity greater than <U+0001D702> <U+0001D45D>/100 <U+0001D43C>0 (for example, for <U+F068>=0.01, 15% of the reactor is illuminated
with more than 50% of the original flux).
5.2.2 Exact discretization into two layers does not exist
In most studies focusing on the flashing effect, light is represented with an oversimplified
on/off signal. We offer a better option to represent the light pattern, assuming that the light source
switches between two intensities. In this framework, each intensity represents the average light in a
two-layer discretization of the raceway. The challenge lies in the determination of the light intensities
to be applied and of the switching frequency for the light to represent key properties of the light signal
at cell scale in a raceway.
Considering an upper euphotic layer of depth h with average light intensity IE, and a lower dark layer
with average light intensity ID, we seek for a realistic probability (or frequency, if a periodic light signal
is required) for the cell to switch between these layers. Both layers are characterized by their average
irradiance. A desirable property would be to reconstruct a light signal switching between IE and ID (i)
with time proportions to the probability of a particle to be in each layer, (ii) with an average light
intensity I for the overall light signal equal to the mean light intensity in the process, and (iii) with light
intensities IE and ID in agreement with the average light distribution in each layer. Such a light pattern
would ensure correspondence between the biological stimuli and the physics of the process.
We demonstrate (see the supplementary information, SI.9) that such behaviour cannot be achieved
for a discretized water depth. Indeed, the average light when switching between IE and ID at rate p (p
= h/L is the probability to be in the euphotic layer) is not the expected average light, unless the lower
layer has a zero thickness.
5.2.3 Variance computation
Instead of searching for a framework representing the average light in each layer, we seek a
criterion that plays a key role in the photosynthetic dynamics: the variance of the light signal. Indeed,
light variance is also strongly constrained by medium homogeneity and by the light extinction
coefficient. The theoretical light variance based on the pdf of I is (see SI.10):
(6)
It is worth noting that light variance is independent of fluid velocity and depends only on the light
gradient through <U+F068>. This non-intuitive result implies that the light variance is not related to the
hydrodynamic properties, which conveniently simplifies the design of a realistic signal.
<U+0001D43C>¯
Now, considering a simple on/off light pattern oscillating between I0 and 0 at frequency <U+0001D45D> = <U+0001D43C> (case
0
A), a much larger variance (<U+0001D43C> ¯ (<U+0001D43C>0 - <U+0001D43C> )¯ ) is obtained than that given by equation (6). For example, for
<U+03B7>w= 1%, the variance induced by a light commutation between I0 and 0 is 2.7 times greater than the
variance in the actual culture process.
We propose an alternative strategy to synthesize simple, yet realistic light signals for lab
experiments. We relax constraint (iii) on the realism of IE and ID, and, instead, impose a condition of
light variance: (iii.b) variance of light intensity according to (6). In this new framework, IE and ID are no
longer assumed to represent the average light intensity within each layer.
There are infinite combinations of IE and ID once p has been chosen (see SI.11); in the following we
consider two options: cells oscillating between IE and darkness (case B) or between I0 and ID (case C).
5.2.4 Alternative choice for simple light patterns
Case B. Switching between IE and 0
In this case, the upper light signal is IE, lower than the surface light I0. This approach is the
simplest because it corresponds to an on/off signal. Here:
(7)
The resulting light period is presented in Figure 8 (case B), and the typical light pattern appears in
Figure 9B.
Case C. Switching between I0 and ID
Here, the upper light signal is I0. This approach is more relevant for experimental studies
targeting photoinhibition and stimulating the xanthophyll cycle because it exposes cells to the highest
light level they might encounter. In this option, ID is not zero and can be computed (see SI.11):
(8)
Figure 8: Proportion of high light (euphotic layer depth) with respect to <U+F068>=IL/I0, for three different strategies. (A)
The simple strategy for an on/off signal, with appropriate proportion of high-light I0, (B) light pattern with
appropriate high-light fraction, average light, and standard deviation, with 0 as the lower light intensity (given
by Eq. (7)), and (C) light pattern with appropriate high-light fraction, average light, and standard deviation, with
I0 as the maximum light (given by Eq. (8)).
Figure 9: Representative step functions for light patterns in agreement with actual light distribution for IL/I0 =
0.01. Three possible strategies are presented: (A) The simple on/off strategy, with an appropriate proportion of
high light I0, (B) light pattern with an appropriate high-light fraction, average light, and standard deviation, with
0 as lower light intensity (given by Eq. (7)), and (C) Light pattern with an appropriate high-light fraction, average
light, and standard deviation, with I0 as the maximum light (given by Eq. (8)) (appropriate for studying energy
dissipation through the xanthophyll cycles).
The resulting light periods are presented in Figure 8 (case C), and the typical light pattern is illustrated
in Figure 9C. It is noteworthy that this approach yields longer darker periods than what are generally
studied in classical light/dark experiments (case A). In addition, the use of low light (and not zero) is
more representative of real conditions. It is different from total darkness since it maintains a minimal
photosynthetic activity and ensures a minimal level of oxygen in the cell.
Finally, we compare these step signals with the realistic paragon signal computed in Section 2.3 and
experimentally applied to the culture. At first glance, the signal plotted in Fig. 3.2 is rather similar to
the recommended step signal computed in for case C. The time spent at high-light for the paragon –
i.e. with a light intensity higher than p.I0 (where p=13.5%, as defined in case C)– is 15.8%, which is
coherent consistent with 9.2% of time at low-light recommended for case C.
5.3 Toward realistic experiments
Lagrangian simulation is an appropriate route to downscale experiments studying the effects of
mixing on the efficiency of photon use. Even though such a framework requires a complex
experimental set-up and renders experiments more difficult to run, combining fast light variations (at
the scale of seconds) with long-term experiments (at the scale of weeks) to account for cell
photoacclimation remains of utmost importance. Better numerical schemes are expected to more
accurately reconstruct the Lagrangian trajectory with higher Navier-Stokes fidelity. Also, advanced
nonlinear optics describing light fields in a multidiffusive environment may more accurately
represent light distribution. The key challenge to decipher the link between productivity and mixing
energy is to reconstruct the light pattern for different mixing intensities. In Supplementary
Information SI.7, we show that the dissipated energy is multiplied by 5.4 when the average fluid
velocity is increased from 0.15 m.s-1 to 0.3 m.s-1. According to our experimental study, it is clear that
this large increase in energy demand is not compensated by a larger productivity, and can even
become counter -productive.
As demonstrated in this work, the Lagrangian patterns should have inherent theoretical properties
(average light, standard deviation) independent of the hydrodynamic regime. To date, no numerical
model guaranties these properties when considering various mixing regimes. Using relevantly
designed light signals will thus contribute to better understand photosynthesis and NPQ in realistic
conditions, provided that the high to low light exposure ratio is appropriately tuned to optical depth.
Finally, it must be emphasized that simple step signals are generic and rather independent from the
geometry of the process, while a Lagrangian-derived light pattern is tailored to a specific process, and
associated to with a mixing regime. Modifying the process geometry or the mixing intensity affects
cell trajectories and eventually the light pattern. The Lagrangian trajectories should thus be
recomputed for any change in the systemgeometry. The cost for setting up the numerical simulation,
and for adapting it to new conditions are then the limits of the approach.
7. Conclusion
Experiments usually performed with representative on/off light signals for studying the
flashing effect in a dense culture are generally not consistent with the real physics. It is impossible to
select an appropriate combination between two light intensities while respecting key physical
principles. In this approach, the frequency of alternation between high and low light is related to both
an underlying discretization into layers and to the average fluid velocity. Reconstructing a realistic light
pattern using a Lagrangian approach is, therefore, of importance for downscaling real processes. Using
this approach, microalgae in laboratory environments experience similar conditions to those in
industrial processes. Corresponding experiments growing Dunaliella salina revealed complex
behaviours, different from previous on/off experiments, which can not be explained by classical
models. The trade-off between photosynthesis and photoprotection, through photoacclimation,
seems to be triggered differently according to the light signal period. Further studies are needed to
understand the intracellular regulation mechanisms that appear in these highly variable environments.
The chlorophyll content proved to be highly dependent upon the rate of light variation, and thus on
fluid velocity. If such a result is confirmed, there is an optimal agitation rate that can maximize growth.
Experiments in high-density cultures could confirm these findings. This study highlights the benefits of
a multidisciplinary approach, where improvement of the fluid dynamics modelling leads to a new
generation of experiments emphasizing unexplored acclimation mechanisms.

SI. 1. Detailed materials and methods
Culture conditions. The Chlorophyceae Dunaliella salina was obtained from the Culture Collection of
Algae and Protozoa (CCAP 18/19). The strain was grown axenically in an f/2 medium within cylindrical
(77mm diameter 77mm) double-walled borosilicate glass photobioreactors with an effective capacity
of 500 mL (SCHOTT DURAN). Water The recirculation of water within their double walls regulated the
temperature at to 27°C in the cultures. Magnetic stirrers were used to homogenize the cultures.
Bubbling was provided with air filtered flowing through a Whatman filter (0.2 <U+F06D>m). Experiments were
carried out with simultaneous culture duplicates grown in fed-batch. Cultures were diluted with fresh
sterile medium every 8 days. Only 10 to 15% of the initial volume was kept, in order to restart cultures
with an initial cell density of 5.104 cell.mL-1.
Light supply system. Photobioreactors were illuminated with arrays of six white LEDs (Led SmartArray,
12x Nichia LEDs, 6W, Lumitronix) installed on a circular aluminium frame. The LEDs drivers (LPF-60D-
36, Meanwell) were controlled by an open-source electronics prototyping platform Arduino Mega
2560 to generate the light pattern. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was monitored on at five
positions in each photobioreactor during the experiments using a 2<U+F070> light sensor (Biospherical
Instruments QSL-100). Light intensity intensites at these five locations differed by less than 5% and was
were stable along across the experiments.
The dDifferent light patterns were applied to the cultures, and an additional control was carried out
with a continuous light of equal mean irradiance (82.2 µmol.m-2.s-1).
The maximum irradiance in the culture system was meadured measured with a 2<U+F070> light sensor placed
in a photobioreactor filled with medium. After correcting this signal relative to algal biomass, we
considered this estimation as I0.
Cell population, cell size. After inoculation, the changes in population density and mean diameter were
monitored twice a day, in triplicates, using a Coulter Counter Beckman (Multisizer 3) with a 50 µm
aperture tube. The cell suspension was diluted with filtered (0.2 µm) seawater (38 g.L-1), to obtain an
adequate cell concentration. For each experimental condition, the specific average growth rate (µ, day-
1
) was estimated, during the exponential phase, from cell counts (X cells mL-1). A linear regression was
carried out between time and natural logarithm of cell density, and the slope was the average growth
rate (AGR).
Pigment analysis. Pigments were extracted from algae from the second day onward. Samples of 3 mL
cell suspensions were sampled daily taken from the reactors and transferred to 10 10-mL tubes
wrapped with aluminium paper. For the extraction, 6 mL of 90% acetone were added in each tube,
and immediately stored during for 1 hour at -20 °C. Cells were precipitated by centrifugation at 2000
rpm for 5 minutes. Absorbance was measured in duplicate at 470 nm, 644.80 and 661.60 nm
corresponding to absorption maxima of carotenoids, chlorophyll b and chlorophyll a respectively
(Lichtenthaler, 1987), with a UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, US/VIS, Lambda 2).
Concentrations of chlorophyll a (Ca), chlorophyll b (Cb) and of total carotenoids (Cx+c) (µg.mL-1) were
calculated from the equations according of to Lichtenthaler (1987).
Elemental stoichiometry. Carbon and nitrogen cell quotas (pmol.cell-1) were determined once a dayly
from the 4th day on. Samples (6.8 mL) were first filtered onto pre-combusted (4 hours at 450°C) GF/C
filters (Whatman) and then dried at 60°C before analysis with a CHN analyser (2400 Series II CHNS/O -
Perkin Elmer). Nitrogen (pmol-N.cell-1) and carbon (pmol-C.cell-1) cell contents were estimated using
the cell abundance measured at the time of sampling.
SI. 2. Response of Dunaliella salina to simple light/cycles
The following figure is extracted from the study of Combe et al. (2015), with the same experimental
set-up and the same strain of Dunaliella salina (CCAP 18/19). This graph is reproduced here to
recallillustrates the “standard” response to a simple on/off light cycle of increasing frequency. It also
demonstrates that the authors recorded the expected behavior, consistent with the vast literature, in
this classical approach.

Most of the experiments were carried out with the same light and dark durations, except the
two experiments identified in green and red. Comparison with continuous light is also shown.
SI. 3. Multi-layer discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations
The Navier-Stokes equations consist in comprise three set of equations. The first represents

This system is was solved according to the following boundary conditions:<U+2061> <U+0001D461> > <U+0001D461>0 , x <U+2208><U+2061> R, and
<U+0001D467><U+0001D44F><U+2061> (<U+0001D465>) = <U+0001D467><U+2061> = <U+F068>(<U+0001D465>, <U+0001D461>), with <U+F068>(<U+0001D465>, <U+0001D461>) the free surface elevation, <U+0001D462> = (<U+0001D462>, <U+0001D464>)<U+0001D447> the velocity vector,
<U+0001D45D>(<U+0001D465>, <U+0001D467>, <U+0001D461>) the pressure, <U+0001D454> the gravity and <U+0001D70C>(<U+0001D447>) the water density. The components of the wheel’s force
are described bywere <U+0001D439><U+0001D465><U+2061> (<U+0001D465>, <U+0001D467>, <U+0001D461>) and <U+0001D439><U+0001D467><U+2061> (<U+0001D465>, <U+0001D467>, <U+0001D461>). Hence the water height is was <U+0001D43B> = <U+F068> - <U+0001D467><U+0001D44F> . The
equations are were integrated on the water height and only the average horizontal velocity is was
considered in each layer for the Saint-Venant multilayer approach.
To approximate the numerical solutions of to the Navier-Stokes equations, a Galerkin type
approximation of the velocity field with piecewise constant basis functions was were used in order to
obtain an accurate description of the vertical profile of the horizontal velocity. Such a strategy has
several advantages (Allgeyer et al. 2017), and allows to:
<U+F0B7> rewrite the Navier-Stokes equations can be rewritten under the form of a system of
conservation laws with source terms,
<U+F0B7> easy simple handle handling of the free surface, which does not require moving
meshes,
<U+F0B7> take advantage of robust and accurate numerical techniques developed for Shallow
shallow Water water type systems.
In the new formulation, the model admits a kinetic interpretation, and leads to a robust finite- volume
scheme.

SI. 9. Computation of average light and probability to beof being in a layer
The average light in the upper euphotic layer IE can be computed is:as follows (Ih is the light at depth
h, the bottom of the euphotic zone):
(9)
Where Ih is the light at depth h, the bottom of the euphotic zone.
1 <U+0001D43C> 1 <U+0001D43C> <U+0001D43C>h
Now, from Equation (1): <U+2061>ln <U+0001D43F> = ln h . Since Because <U+0001D45D> = h/<U+0001D43F>, we have = <U+F068><U+0001D443>
<U+0001D43F> <U+0001D43C>0 h<U+2061> <U+0001D43C>0 <U+0001D43C>0
(10)
and likewise:
(11)
Now, the aAverage light value, when commuting between IE and ID can be computed as followsis:
(12)
As a consequence, the average light equation yields:
(13)
which reduces to:
(14)
The right hand side is an increasing function of <U+0001D45D>, while the left hand side is a decreasing function. The
trivial solution <U+0001D45D> = 1 is thus the only one.
This shows that commuting between two light intensities representing the average light in the two
layers cannot generate the actual average light.
SI. 10. Computation of the signal variance
The variance associated to with an average light is given by:
(15)
Thus,
(16)
Using equation (IV-29) giving for the expression of average light, we get:
(17)
SI. 11. Light pattern variance
Assumeing a light pattern commuting between IE and ID such that:
• The average value is <U+0001D43C>:
(18)
• The variance is <U+F06E>:
(19)
Equation (19)which can be rewritten:
(20)
Finally, the average-variance Equations (18) and (20) can be rewritten as:
(21)
where and
This system of two equations has three unknowns unknowns(<U+0001D45D>, <U+0001D43C><U+0001D438> , <U+0001D43C><U+0001D437><U+2061> ).
i. System resolutionSolution in the casefor <U+0001D43C><U+0001D437> = 0
Assuming <U+0001D43C><U+0001D437> = 0, the system becomes simpler:
(22)
The solution is therefore:
(23)
This means:
(24)
ii. System resolutionSolution for <U+0001D43C><U+0001D438><U+2061> = <U+0001D43C>0
The system is now:
(25)
The first equation yields:
(26)
which can be injected substituted into the second equation, leading to:
(27)
whose solution is:
(28)
Finally, we have:
