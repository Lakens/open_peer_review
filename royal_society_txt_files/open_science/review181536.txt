Review: RSOS-1815536
Functional tests of the competitive exclusion hypothesis for multituberculate extinction
by authors
N. Adams, E. Rayfield, P. Cox, S. Cobb, I. Corfe
Summary:
The authors present the very first computer aided testing of the long standing hypothesis that
multituberculates were outcompeted by rodents during the Cenozoic. Throughout the
manuscript this hypothesis is referred to as “competitive exclusion (CE) hypothesis”. The
multituberculate skull morphology and dentition show functional similarities to rodents.
Multituberculata were very abundant and divers in the Mesozoic, but the diversity declined
during the mid-late Paleocene and onwards. Multituberculates are often referred to as the
“rodents of the Mesozoic” due to the functional similarities. In their study the authors investigate
one multituberculate skull and compare to four rodent skulls applying the Finite Element
Analysis. The hypotheses being tested are: 1) whether rodent skulls are better adapted to deal
with higher stresses linked to different feeding behavior (gnawing versus chewing) and thus
show lower stress patterns, 2) rodents skulls can generate higher bite forces than
multituberculates, and 3) rodents skulls are more resistant to bending and torsion. In order to
address these hypotheses the Upper Cretaceous multituberculate taxon Kryptobaatar dashzevegi
was compared to extant rodent taxa. The presented results show basically mixed support for the
CE hypothesis.
General impression:
The submitted manuscript is well written and well organized, addressing one of the longest
standing hypothesis of mammalian evolution. The authors applied adequate methods to address
the different hypotheses that were posed. The results are well presented and sufficiently
illustrated. In order to clarify certain aspects of the discussion section electronic supplementary
material was added. Results are very critically discussed. The manuscript is interesting, because
existing weak points of this study are well summarized by authors themselves to a great extent.
For example, the choice of taxa is well defended based on existing literature. However,
comparing one Upper Cretaceous supposedly omnivorous multituberculate skull to three extant
omnivorous rodent taxa and one herbivorous extant rodent taxon still bears problems.
Suggestions for improvement:
In my opinion three main subjects are not addressed:
1) Palinal (multituberculate) versus proal (rodent) chewing movement. The groups evolved
opposite directed power strokes in their chewing movements and muscles fibers are operating
differently. Thus, proportions and attachment sites of muscles are different, which is also
reflected in skull morphology and the different expression of the glenoid fossa. When reading the
manuscript the reader gets the impression that both groups do exactly the same, just differ in
skull morphology. In order to address this issue, I suggest to present an illustration of the muscle
attachment sites for all five taxa. Because the opposing chewing movements exist between
rodents and multituberculates, I suggest to also add a map with calculated muscle vectors, for at
least one rodent and Kryptobaatar. This can be easily added to the electronic supplementary
material. This way the paper opens to a broader audience, and is easier to follow for people who
3
are not working with FEA or anatomy of the mammalian skull.
2) The chosen rodent taxa of this study all possess a significant angular process, multituberculates
don’t. The angular process is functionally important in rodents as it connects with the medial
pterygoid and has influence in chewing performance (see for example Grossnickel 2017 on non-
multis). In addition, the coronoid process and position of the jaw joint of multituberculates is
fundamentally different from the rodent type. All of these morphological features influence the
overall proportions and must have an influence on the FEA analysis. This needs to be addressed
at some point in the discussion.
3) The authors mention Kryptobaatar is a burrowing animal, which is clearly reflected in the skull
morphology. And yet no burrowing rodent taxon was chosen for this study, all are mainly
terrestrial even arboreal. The discussion of some statements about borrowing rodents and their
similarities to Kryptobaatar based on the cited literature will greatly contribute to the manuscript.
Minor issues:
- Some of the presented results are discussed in support for the CE hypothesis, but important
aspects that might have had influence apart from chewing performance are neglected (e.g.,
number of offspring, breeding and nesting behavior, reproduction strategies).
- At one point the authors claim the genus Kryptobaatar doesn’t change significantly over several
million years, but as I understand it this was not tested. This seems a strong statement and needs
proof.
- I suggest to add FEA maps for all rodent skulls investigated in this study, not only Kryptobaatar
versus Mus. The authors particularly write in their introduction that they analyzed the data for
all rodent types (i.e., sciurognath, hystricomorph etc.). The maps should be added to the
electronic supplementary material in order to present the results described and to support the
discussion of the hypothesis that rodent skulls are more resistant to bending and torsion. Guinea
pig, rat, mouse and squirrel, are mentioned, but no skull shape of these is illustrated. This is
necessary, especially when an emphasis is made on the different rodent skull configurations (i.e.,
sciurognath, hystricomorph etc.).
- Page 6, Lines 130-134: the authors discuss why it’s justified to use extant rodent taxa based on
their similarities to their earliest ancestors. It is necessary to also assess the main differences here,
as they can be used in the discussion below for interpreting some of the major findings of this
study.
- The discussion appears generalized and is not addressing specific differences between the
investigated rodent taxa. The last paragraph of the discussion ends with interpreting the
evolution of mostly herbivorous taxa and how they spread in to different niches during the
Cenozoic, however the analysis presented here is mostly based on omnivorous taxa.
You can find some additional minor comments within the submitted pdf of the manuscript.
Decision
The study is of great interest to the scientific community, as it is the first computer aided analysis
that addresses a major theme of mammalian evolution. I recommend to publish the paper after
some modifications are made.

Julia Schultz.

In this study, Adams and co-authors analyze a multituberculate skull using biomechanical
modeling techniques, and compare results with representative extant rodent models. They found
that rodents tend to have both higher stresses and higher bite force production capabilities
compared to the fossil Kryptobaatar. They conclude that superior bite force production in rodents
may have been a factor in the clade-level replacement of multituberculates during the Paleogene.
The study provides the first test of a functional explanation for the competitive exclusion
hypothesis for macroevolutionary trends in the two clades.
The manuscript is well-written, and the modeling protocol fully documented. The authors
considered several potential methodological sources of variation in their simulation approach,
and provided either validated protocols or sensitivity analyses to verify robustness of their data
and statistical comparisons. The discussion and conclusion were made with a clear recognition of
the limitations of the particular approach and data. I applaud the authors for sharing all of their
data and materials in an open-access repository, truly exemplifying open science.
I have only a few major and minor suggestions for improving the framework of the study:
Major:
-I understand that fossil specimens are difficult to come by for this kind of studies, so there isn't
much one can do to increase sample size for fossil species modeled. However, the fact that
Rodentia represents one of the most diversified living mammal groups, and the research question
is clade-level replacement of multituberculates by rodents, makes the use of only four species
models difficult to palate. Could the authors provide a figure or table demonstrating the
"representativeness" of the four rodent models used, in terms of how broad of a taxonomic and
ecological coverage they represent? In addition, I think it would be beneficial to include some
visual comparisons of multituberculate cranial and dental diversity, to provide a firmer context
for the hypotheses being tested in the study. Are these two groups morphologically similar
enough that a competitive exclusion hypothesis with a functional explanation is the most
5
appropriate question to ask? I suspect so, but I would like to see a strong case made in the
introduction with some direct visual comparisons.
Minor:
-There are several places where there is no space between sentences. Please check.
-P10 L218: how many cross-sectional image stacks were analyzed for section moduli? This
information is explained in the supplement, but a summary of the dataset size should be
indicated in the main text for context.
-P16 L379: the phrase "progressive adaptation" is a bit troubling to me. I understand that the
authors are referring to deep time differences in feeding niche adaptations that may exist
between extant rodents and their Paleogene predecessors. However, This phrasing evokes
direction and objective to evolutionary change. If there is specific evidence pointing to rodent
evolution as broadly progressive (i.e., some trait improving unidirectionally over time), please
cite references here. Otherwise, I recommend framing the potential ecological differences
between extant and fossil rodents as a product of deep time changes in both environment and
species represented (in other words, not necessarily progressive by default).

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Professor Emily Standen):
Dear Adams et al.,
Thank you for submitting your paper to RSOS. We have now received sufficient reviews and are
pleased to say they are very positive in their responses. Both reviewers do bring up very
important and interesting points for you to consider and that have the potential to increase the
impact of your paper significantly.
Both the anatomical and functional differences between groups compared need to be addressed
further particularly with respect to skeletal features that will impact the biomechanical forces and
performance between groups. In addition the breadth of the species used in the comparison
might be improved. The reviewers mention concerns regarding comparing fossils with extant
taxa of very differing lifehistory strategies. Although not mentioned by the reviewers, as a non-
paleo morphologist I am also interested in what contemporary Rodentia fossils exist that you
might be able to include in your comparison with multituberculates for a more accurate
understanding of the competition that actually existed between species at the time.
This is a nice contribution to the literature and we look forward to seeing it returned. Please
carefully address the comments of both reviewers and resubmit your paper.
Sincerely,
Emily Standen

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Professor Emily Standen):
Dear Adams et al.,
Thank you for submitting your paper to RSOS. We have now received
sufficient reviews and are pleased to say they are very positive in their
responses. Both reviewers do bring up very important and interesting points
for you to consider and that have the potential to increase the impact of your
paper significantly.
Both the anatomical and functional differences between groups compared
need to be addressed further particularly with respect to skeletal features that
will impact the biomechanical forces and performance between groups. In
addition the breadth of the species used in the comparison might be improved.
The reviewers mention concerns regarding comparing fossils with extant taxa
of very differing lifehistory strategies. Although not mentioned by the reviewers,
as a non-paleo morphologist I am also interested in what contemporary
Rodentia fossils exist that you might be able to include in your comparison with
multituberculates for a more accurate understanding of the competition that
actually existed between species at the time.
The points raised by the reviewers are addressed below. In addition,
contemporaneous Paleogene rodents are considered more fully in the
comparison with extant rodents (lines 135-148) and examples are now
illustrated in the new Figure 2.
This is a nice contribution to the literature and we look forward to seeing it
returned. Please carefully address the comments of both reviewers and
resubmit your paper.
Sincerely,
Emily Standen

Reviewer 1
Summary:
The authors present the very first computer aided testing of the long standing
hypothesis that multituberculates were outcompeted by rodents during the
Cenozoic. Throughout the manuscript this hypothesis is referred to as
“competitive exclusion (CE) hypothesis”. The multituberculate skull
morphology and dentition show functional similarities to rodents.
Multituberculata were very abundant and divers in the Mesozoic, but the
diversity declined during the mid-late Paleocene and onwards.
Multituberculates are often referred to as the “rodents of the Mesozoic” due to
the functional similarities. In their study the authors investigate one
multituberculate skull and compare to four rodent skulls applying the Finite
Element Analysis. The hypotheses being tested are: 1) whether rodent skulls
are better adapted to deal with higher stresses linked to different feeding
behavior (gnawing versus chewing) and thus show lower stress patterns, 2)
rodents skulls can generate higher bite forces than multituberculates, and 3)
rodents skulls are more resistant to bending and torsion. In order to address
these hypotheses the Upper Cretaceous multituberculate taxon Kryptobaatar
dashzevegi was compared to extant rodent taxa. The presented results show
basically mixed support for the CE hypothesis.
General impression:
The submitted manuscript is well written and well organized, addressing one
of the longest standing hypothesis of mammalian evolution. The authors
applied adequate methods to address the different hypotheses that were
posed. The results are well presented and sufficiently illustrated. In order to
clarify certain aspects of the discussion section electronic supplementary
material was added. Results are very critically discussed. The manuscript is
interesting, because existing weak points of this study are well summarized by
authors themselves to a great extent. For example, the choice of taxa is well
defended based on existing literature. However, comparing one Upper
Cretaceous supposedly omnivorous multituberculate skull to three extant
omnivorous rodent taxa and one herbivorous extant rodent taxon still bears
problems.
Suggestions for improvement:
In my opinion three main subjects are not addressed:
1) Palinal (multituberculate) versus proal (rodent) chewing movement. The
groups evolved opposite directed power strokes in their chewing movements
and muscles fibers are operating differently. Thus, proportions and attachment
sites of muscles are different, which is also reflected in skull morphology and
the different expression of the glenoid fossa. When reading the manuscript the
reader gets the impression that both groups do exactly the same, just differ in
skull morphology. In order to address this issue, I suggest to present an
illustration of the muscle attachment sites for all five taxa. Because the
opposing chewing movements exist between rodents and multituberculates, I
suggest to also add a map with calculated muscle vectors, for at least one
4
rodent and Kryptobaatar. This can be easily added to the electronic
supplementary material. This way the paper opens to a broader audience, and
is easier to follow for people who are not working with FEA or anatomy of the
mammalian skull.
The different chewing movements of multituberculates and rodents are now
addressed with:
<U+F0B7> A new Figure 3 showing muscle attachment sites and vectors for
Kryptobaatar and Mus.
<U+F0B7> A new Figure S1 showing 3D muscle reconstruction for Kryptobaatar
for comparison with 3D muscle proportions of rodents in already
published works (e.g., Baverstock et al., Cox et al.)
<U+F0B7> A new Figure S2 showing muscle attachment sites for the other three
rodents.
<U+F0B7> A new section (b) of the Discussion on ‘Masticatory and
musculoskeletal differences between multituberculates and rodents’.
2) The chosen rodent taxa of this study all possess a significant angular
process, multituberculates don’t. The angular process is functionally important
in rodents as it connects with the medial pterygoid and has influence in chewing
performance (see for example Grossnickel 2017 on non-multis). In addition,
the coronoid process and position of the jaw joint of multituberculates is
fundamentally different from the rodent type. All of these morphological
features influence the overall proportions and must have an influence on the
FEA analysis. This needs to be addressed at some point in the discussion.
The implications of differently structured morphological features (such as the
glenoid fossa, condylar and coronoid processes, angular process, and
pterygoid shelf) are now all addressed in the new section (b) of the Discussion
on ‘Masticatory and musculoskeletal differences between multituberculates
and rodents’.
3) The authors mention Kryptobaatar is a burrowing animal, which is clearly
reflected in the skull morphology. And yet no burrowing rodent taxon was
chosen for this study, all are mainly terrestrial even arboreal. The discussion
of some statements about borrowing rodents and their similarities to
Kryptobaatar based on the cited literature will greatly contribute to the
manuscript.
Discussion of burrowing rodents and similarities to Kryptobaatar have been
added (lines 503-529).
Minor issues:
- Some of the presented results are discussed in support for the CE
hypothesis, but important aspects that might have had influence apart from
chewing performance are neglected (e.g., number of offspring, breeding and
nesting behavior, reproduction strategies).
Consideration of other factors relevant for the CE hypothesis, such as
reproduction but also locomotion, has now been added to the discussion (lines
633-640).
5
- At one point the authors claim the genus Kryptobaatar doesn’t change
significantly over several million years, but as I understand it this was not
tested. This seems a strong statement and needs proof.
We do not claim this at any point in the manuscript and do not know where the
reviewer came across this idea in the text.
It possibly arose from the sentence “Kryptobaatar dates to 10-35 million years
before the Paleogene multituberculates that were potentially competing with
rodents.” The time range of ‘10-35 million years’ relates to dating uncertainties
of the Kryptobaatar, early rodent and Paleogene multituberculate fossil sites
rather than a known 10-35 million-year persistence of the genus Kryptobaatar
in unchanged form. Added “age range due to dating uncertainties of early
rodent, Paleogene multituberculate, and especially Kryptobaatar fossil sites,
e.g. [50]” [Kielan-Jaworowska et al. (2003)] in lines 480-481 to clarify.
- I suggest to add FEA maps for all rodent skulls investigated in this study, not
only Kryptobaatar versus Mus. The authors particularly write in their
introduction that they analyzed the data for all rodent types (i.e., sciurognath,
hystricomorph etc.). The maps should be added to the electronic
supplementary material in order to present the results described and to support
the discussion of the hypothesis that rodent skulls are more resistant to
bending and torsion. Guinea pig, rat, mouse and squirrel, are mentioned, but
no skull shape of these is illustrated. This is necessary, especially when an
emphasis is made on the different rodent skull configurations (i.e., sciurognath,
hystricomorph etc.).
We do not claim to have undertaken FEA on the crania of all rodent types
(sciuromorph, hystricomorph, myomorph) in the Introduction. As we mentioned
explicitly in section (b) of the Material and methods in the submitted
manuscript, “digital models and results from cranial FEA of three extant rodents
(Sciurus, Cavia, Rattus) were taken directly from the Cox et al. study and were
used for comparison with the new results for the Kryptobaatar cranium
calculated herein”. We show the cranial FEA results for Kryptobaatar and Mus,
because these are the new results from our study. The cranial FEA for Sciurus,
Cavia and Rattus was done in a previous study and so we do not show the
FEA maps because they are already published elsewhere.
The skull shape of the mouse is shown in figure 4b and 4d. The FEA maps
from the Cox et al. (2012) study have been added to the supplementary
material (figure S12) to make it easier for readers to directly compare our
results with the previously published models. These FEA maps also illustrate
the skull shape for the guinea pig, rat and squirrel as requested. Skull shapes
for the rat, squirrel and guinea pig are also illustrated in the new Figure 2,
comparing them to Paleogene rodent skulls.
- Page 6, Lines 130-134: the authors discuss why it’s justified to use extant
rodent taxa based on their similarities to their earliest ancestors. It is necessary
to also assess the main differences here, as they can be used in the discussion
below for interpreting some of the major findings of this study.
6
The differences between extant and extinct forms have been added and
similarities have been revised and expanded (see lines 135-148).
- The discussion appears generalized and is not addressing specific
differences between the investigated rodent taxa.
The specific differences between investigated rodent taxa are not the focus of
this paper and have been discussed at length by Cox et al. (2012, PLoS ONE,
7: e36299). The focus of this paper is on the comparison between rodents and
the multituberculate Kryptobaatar. In section (a) of the Discussion we do
discuss the specific differences between different rodents and Kryptobaatar
and how these relate to our initial hypotheses.
The last paragraph of the discussion ends with interpreting the evolution of
mostly herbivorous taxa and how they spread in to different niches during the
Cenozoic, however the analysis presented here is mostly based on
omnivorous taxa.
We have expanded this discussion to note that the benefits of higher bite forces
are not just applicable to granivory, but also to frugivory, omnivory, insectivory
and carnivory (lines 607-614 and 621-624). As discussed in the manuscript,
the taxa analysed are imperfect representatives of Paleocene rodents and
Paleocene multituberculates, so we do extend inferences based on
omnivorous taxa to purportedly herbivorous/granivorous taxa. We discuss
these caveats in the manuscript (discussion section (c) of the revised
manuscript) and eagerly await the testing of our results and conclusions in
future work.
You can find some additional minor comments within the submitted pdf of the
manuscript [copied below from the annotated pdf]:
1) Keywords: delete ‘competitive exclusion’ – This is already part of the title of
the manuscript
Deleted and replaced with ‘macroevolution’.
2) Line 29 “four extant rodents”: even though well discussed, I think this bears
some problems. See my comments in the letter.
Addressed above.
3) Lines 132-134: I suggest to not only cite the similarities, but add also main
differences between early and advanced. This way it might be easier to circle
back in the discussion.
Differences added.
4) Line 299: Please add the FEA maps of all rodents you investigated in the
supplement. Also muscle attachment maps would help the reader to follow.
As mentioned above, cranial FEA maps for the squirrel, guinea pig and rat
have now been added to the supplement to enable easy comparison, but they
are not new results from this study. Muscle attachment maps added in Figures
3 and S2.

5) Lines 388-392: Assumption, this needs some support from literature.
The preceding lines of the manuscript (lines 457-460) reference key literature
comparing masticatory efficiency of protrogomorph rodents with sciuromorph
and hystricomorph rodents. Additional reference to Druzinsky (2010), which
demonstrates lower biting efficiency at the incisors in prototrogomorph vs
sciuromorph rodents, added in line 459.
Also, the sentence “Therefore, if protrogomorph rodents were included in the
analyses conducted in this study they might be expected to have lower bite
forces with values closer to those of Kryptobaatar…” is a prediction rather than
an assumption. It is something to be tested by future work, not something we
assume to be true.
6) Lines 401-402: Assumption, this needs some support from literature
The preceding lines of the manuscript (lines 464-472) provide literature support
for our suggestion that early Paleogene protrogomorph rodents could produce
similar bite forces to extant rodents. We have added “with protrogomorph
muscle configuration” in line 473-474 to highlight the relevance of the
preceding literature for our suggestion.
7) Lines 513-514: But Kryptobaatar is assumed to have been omnivorous
Addressed above.
8) Line 529: I suggest to add the links for the data used from Digimorph here,
too.
Links to DigiMorph data have been added, as well as links to MorphoSource
for rodent CT scan data.
9) Figure 2: Main issue here is the presence of the angular process in all
rodents. Kryptobaatar has none, so the von Mises stress pattern have to be
different.
This point is addressed in the new section (b) of the Discussion. Despite
lacking an angular process, multituberculates have an extensive pterygoid
shelf that is analogous in several ways (including adductor muscle
attachment).
Decision:
The study is of great interest to the scientific community, as it is the first
computer aided analysis that addresses a major theme of mammalian
evolution. I recommend to publish the paper after some modifications are
made.

Reviewer 2
In this study, Adams and co-authors analyze a multituberculate skull using
biomechanical modeling techniques, and compare results with representative
extant rodent models. They found that rodents tend to have both higher
stresses and higher bite force production capabilities compared to the fossil
Kryptobaatar. They conclude that superior bite force production in rodents may
have been a factor in the clade-level replacement of multituberculates during
the Paleogene. The study provides the first test of a functional explanation for
the competitive exclusion hypothesis for macroevolutionary trends in the two
clades.
The manuscript is well-written, and the modeling protocol fully documented.
The authors considered several potential methodological sources of variation
in their simulation approach, and provided either validated protocols or
sensitivity analyses to verify robustness of their data and statistical
comparisons. The discussion and conclusion were made with a clear
recognition of the limitations of the particular approach and data. I applaud the
authors for sharing all of their data and materials in an open-access repository,
truly exemplifying open science.
I have only a few major and minor suggestions for improving the framework of
the study:
Major:
-I understand that fossil specimens are difficult to come by for this kind of
studies, so there isn't much one can do to increase sample size for fossil
species modeled. However, the fact that Rodentia represents one of the most
diversified living mammal groups, and the research question is clade-level
replacement of multituberculates by rodents, makes the use of only four
species models difficult to palate. Could the authors provide a figure or table
demonstrating the "representativeness" of the four rodent models used, in
terms of how broad of a taxonomic and ecological coverage they represent? In
addition, I think it would be beneficial to include some visual comparisons of
multituberculate cranial and dental diversity, to provide a firmer context for the
hypotheses being tested in the study. Are these two groups morphologically
similar enough that a competitive exclusion hypothesis with a functional
explanation is the most appropriate question to ask? I suspect so, but I would
like to see a strong case made in the introduction with some direct visual
comparisons.
Two new figures have been produced as requested.
The first (Figure 1) provides an indication of craniodental diversity among some
of the major Paleogene families of multituberculates (Ptilodontidae,
Neoplagiaulacidae, Eucosmodontidae, Microcosmodontidae, Taeniolabididae,
Lambdopsalidae) compared to Kryptobaatar. Relatively complete skulls of
Paleogene multituberculates are known only from four groups (Ptilodontidae,
9
Neoplagiaulacidae, Taeniolabididae, Lambdopsalidae) as far as the authors
are aware.
Although our research question is of clade-level replacement and rodents are
indeed extremely diverse today, during the Paleocene and early Eocene
rodents were not nearly as diverse. Rather than attempt to highlight how the
extant rodents represent the taxonomic and ecological coverage of all modern
rodents, Figure 2 now provides a comparison of how the modern rodents
compare to the Paleogene rodents that would have been in competition with
multituberculates (as requested by the Associate Editor), which we believe is
more relevant to our research question.
Minor:
-There are several places where there is no space between sentences. Please
check.
Spaces added where they were missing.
-P10 L218: how many cross-sectional image stacks were analyzed for section
moduli? This information is explained in the supplement, but a summary of the
dataset size should be indicated in the main text for context.
Details of the procedures for calculating section moduli and polar moments of
inertia from the image stacks have been added in lines 234-237.
-P16 L379: the phrase "progressive adaptation" is a bit troubling to me. I
understand that the authors are referring to deep time differences in feeding
niche adaptations that may exist between extant rodents and their Paleogene
predecessors. However, This phrasing evokes direction and objective to
evolutionary change. If there is specific evidence pointing to rodent evolution
as broadly progressive (i.e., some trait improving unidirectionally over time),
please cite references here. Otherwise, I recommend framing the potential
ecological differences between extant and fossil rodents as a product of deep
time changes in both environment and species represented (in other words,
not necessarily progressive by default).
Rephrased with reference to selection acting on taxa present at any one time
that are best adapted to their environment, including reference to a study
(Tapaltsyan et al., 2015, Cell Rep. 11: 673-680) describing relatively
progressive increase in rodent tooth crown height over millions of years – see
lines 443-450.
