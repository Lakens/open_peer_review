The Réunion grey white-eye displays two colour morphs that are inherited in a Mendelian
fashion. This is a very interesting system that the authors used to search for the underlying genes.
This is a very important step to further tackle evolutionary questions. They employed the up-to-
date genomic tools to look for SNPs that could be associated with colour polymorphism. The
analyses show that there may be some regulatory genes located on the chromosome 1 that
determines whether a bird is brown or grey. Interestingly, they could show that the brown allele
is ancestral and the grey allele derived. This is an interesting study and because I am not a
specialists in genomic analyses, I concentrated on the other aspects of the paper. In this respect, I
have only minor comments.

The ms by Bourgeois et al reports the results of a genomic investigation on colour polymorphism
in a Zosterops borbonicus high-altitude population, where two alternate colour morphs (grey and
brown) coexist. I think the ms reads well, and the results and conclusions seems sound. I have a
few remarks, mostly related to the lack of methodological details, that the authors should
consider in a revised version. These are listed in order of appearance in the text. Major comments
are highlighted with M.
L82: is a key issue
L86: and by identifying
L115: of polymorphic variation
M L127-142: in this section the authors mention the three genomic approaches they have adopted
(i.e. RAD-seq, GBS and WGS). I think that it would be useful to spend a few words to explain
why these different analytical approaches, that are partly overlapping, have been adopted to
address the specific goals of the study (rather than using a single technique). For instance, why
did they use both RAD-seq and GBS? Why the individual-level analyses have not been made by
RAD-seq and GBS has been used instead? It seems that some of the data were obtained from
previously published datasets (e.g. RAD-seq on pooled samples). I think that in this paragraph
the authors should clarify which data from previous publications have been reanalysed and
which ones were produced de novo for the purpose of this study. I really think that a graphical
representation of rationale of the analyses, detailing the different analytical techniques, sample
sizes, origin of data, (from other papers, original, etc.) would be really helpful and aid the reader
in better understanding the structure of this article.
L152: The details of morphometric measurements should be provided here, as it seems they have
been later used for pedigree (see comments below).
L160: More details are required here. Consider rephrasing and explain better.
L173: More details about these microsatellite analyses are required.
M L175: This is very unclear. How could you reconstruct pedigree based on morphometry?
Which traits? How did you carry out this analysis? This lack of details here is truly surprising.
L186: same populations as RAD-seq?
L189: very little details on GBS analyses! There is some more info in the Suppl. Mat. (but this is
not referenced in the text!). For instance, how do they relate to RAD-seq? I admit I am not an
expert of genomics, but as far as I understood the two techniques (RAD-seq and GBS) are quite
tightly related, so the difference between the two (and why here GBS was used instead of RAD-
seq) should be highlighted for the non-specialist.
M L195: the description of this PCA is too vague. PCA is commonly used to reduce
dimensionality of continuous variables into a smaller number of factors that explain variance in
the original variables. How can it be applied to these data? What was the purpose? How was it
exactly made? How did the components relate to allele frequencies? What was the meaning of the
4
components and how much variance did the most important PCs accounted for? Is this the %
reported along the axis names in Fig. B (but not in Fig. 2A)? Why did you consider only PC1 and
PC2?
L203: please explain what ‘decibans’ are.
L213: as for the other genomic analyses, more details should be provided here about WGS (again,
these are provided in the Suppl. Mat., but poorly referenced in the text).
L255: please report full statistics, naked p-values are useless (i.e. F and degrees of freedom).
L258: Spearman’s rho = 0.834
L289: ...by individual GBS data: where is this shown? Please refer to a table, figure, or the like!
Please check for proper referencing of Suppl. Mat. into the main text (see also above)!
L316: grey (not ‘gray’)
L334: chromosome 1 characterized by SNPs strongly
L338: regions previously associated...colour morhps in other species
L339: italicize cis-?
L673: again, these mysterious ‘morphometric’-based analyses appear here. See previous
comments. Please clarify.

Réunion grey white-eye displays two colour morphs that are inherited in a Mendelian fashion. This is a very
resting system that the authors used to search for the underlying genes. This is a very important step to further
le evolutionary questions. They employed the up-to-date genomic tools to look for SNPs that could be
ciated with colour polymorphism. The analyses show that there may be some regulatory genes located on the
mosome 1 that determines whether a bird is brown or grey. Interestingly, they could show that the brown allele
cestral and the grey allele derived. This is an interesting study and because I am not a specialists in genomic

therefore changed the text accordingly (Line 115)
127-142: in this section the authors mention the three genomic approaches they have adopted (i.e. RAD-seq,
S and WGS). I think that it would be useful to spend a few words to explain why these different analytical
oaches, that are partly overlapping, have been adopted to address the specific goals of the study (rather than
g a single technique). For instance, why did they use both RAD-seq and GBS? Why the individual-level
yses have not been made by RAD-seq and GBS has been used instead? It seems that some of the data were
ined from previously published datasets (e.g. RAD-seq on pooled samples). I think that in this paragraph the
ors should clarify which data from previous publications have been reanalysed and which ones were produced
ovo for the purpose of this study. I really think that a graphical representation of rationale of the analyses,
iling the different analytical techniques, sample sizes, origin of data, (from other papers, original, etc.) would be
y helpful and aid the reader in better understanding the structure of this article.
pooled RAD-sequencing dataset was used previously in a technical note published in Mol. Ecol. Res. and aimed
emonstrating the high potential of paired-end RAD sequencing of pooled DNA samples combined with
parative assembly to the zebra finch genome to build large contigs and characterize vast numbers of informative
s in nonmodel passerine bird species in a very efficient and cost-effective way. In the note, we did not use the
to test any hypothesis of biological significance, we just decribed the method. In the present paper, we used this
set to perform the association analyses because it is cost-effective and also allows a greater population
pling than individual sequencing. We then used GBS individual data to confirm the results obtained by Pool-seq,
use it is a completely independent data set and it alleviates some of the possible limitations of using pools in
e of relying upon a reduced population sampling and showing much lower densities of markers than RAD-
encing. GBS was however mostly used to confirm the lack of genome-wide genetic structure associated to
phs. Finally, we used whole-genome data from three families to i) confirm the dominance of the grey allele ii)
in a near-exhaustive list of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations in the associated region to identify
ther coding or cis-regulatory variation was most likely to explain color polymorphism and iii) use a state-of-the-
method requiring whole-genome data to quantify when and on which allele selection occurred.
now provide a table summarizing the rationale of each dataset and sample sizes (Table 1). The following
ence has been added in the Introduction to justify the use of Pool-seq:
is approach provides a cost-effective way to search to detect associations by allowing large numbers of
viduals to be included into a sample and by providing density of markers that are appropriate for mapping
Table 1 for more details on the approaches used in this study).” (Line 135)
2: The details of morphometric measurements should be provided here, as it seems they have been later used for
gree (see comments below).
ddition to sex, several morphometric measurements were used to help reconstruct pedigrees, including weight,
length, tarsus length, bill length, bill width and depth. Details are now included in the Methods section.
also measured five morphological traits with a dial calliper (to the nearest 0.1 mm): tail length (from the uro
al gland to the tip of the longest rectrix), tarsus length (from the intertarsal joint to the most distal undivided
e on the tarsometatarsus), bill length (from the anterior end of the nares to the tip of the upper mandible), bill
h and depth (both measured at the anterior end of the nares)..” (Line 154)
0: More details are required here. Consider rephrasing and explain better.
now refer more explicitly to the approach and have rephrased this sentence:
e determined whether birds were actually able to discriminate morphs by using Vorobyev & Osorio’s (1998)
el of colour perception. This model allows chromatic contrasts between two colours to be compared with a
shold value of colour discrimination by birds (for further details of how this was perfomed see [46])." (Line
)
3: More details about these microsatellite analyses are required.
175: This is very unclear. How could you reconstruct pedigree based on morphometry? Which traits? How did
carry out this analysis? This lack of details here is truly surprising.
thank the referee for pointing out this ambiguity in our presentation of the method we used. Pedigrees were not
ll reconstructed based on morphometry alone. Our approach was to perform two separate analyses, one
uding genetic data only, the other one including both genetic data and a set of individual variables that have the
ntial to inform parentage assignment. We moved some details from the supplementary material to the methods
ion that has now been extensively rewritten.
rforming controlled matings in wild populations is challenging, so to study inheritance patterns we inferred
grees in three natural populations monitored over multiple years at three localities. Given the reduced
ersal in Z. borbonicus [50], samples from these populations were more likely to include parents and their
pring. Pedigree reconstruction was performed using the Bayesian parentage assignment algorithm
lemented in the R package MasterBayes v2.50 [51] and genotype data from an informative panel of eleven
tral microsatellites [52]. A total of 261 birds of known sex were genotyped and included in this analysis. When
wn, a birth cohort identifier was specified to minimize the possibility that individuals appear as potential
nts of offspring from the same or a previous cohort. Since MasterBayes allows the simultaneous use of
etic and phenotypic data that may inform on parentage, the reconstruction was performed twice, a first time
g genotypic information only, and a second time including both genetic and morphometric data (including
ht). The genotyping error rates for each locus, the number of unsampled sires, and the number of unsampled
ales were all estimated jointly from the pedigree. Markov chains were run for 1.1 million iterations, with a
n-in of 100,000 iterations and a thinning interval of 1,000. Parents (or father or mother) were assigned to an
pring with a 95 % joint posterior probability threshold." (Line 179)
6: same populations as RAD-seq?
Please see explanations below.
9: very little details on GBS analyses! There is some more info in the Suppl. Mat. (but this is not referenced in
ext!). For instance, how do they relate to RAD-seq? I admit I am not an expert of genomics, but as far as I
erstood the two techniques (RAD-seq and GBS) are quite tightly related, so the difference between the two (and
here GBS was used instead of RAD-seq) should be highlighted for the non-specialist.
agree this was unclear in the manuscript. GBS is a variation on the classical protocol by Baird et al. that do not
ude any step of size-selection. In our study, digestion was performed using PstI, a 6bp-cutter like EcoRI. Since
a subset of the regions flanking the restriction sites is amplified by PCR, GBS yields a density of usable
kers that is lower than the one generated with standard RAD-seq. One advantage of GBS over RAD-seq though
at it is extremely cost-efficient for individual genotyping owing to the BRC platform at Cornell University.
have now added some additional information in Table 1and in both sections on RAD-seq and GBS sequencing
now read as follows:
RAD-sequencing using pooled DNA samples
dentify loci associated to colour, we used a paired-end RAD-sequencing protocol, using a dataset described
iously and in which six pools of 18-25 individuals representing the two colour morphs in each of three
rate populations (named ‘Bois Ozoux’, ‘Pas de Bellecombe’, and ‘Tévelave’) were sequenced [39]. We took
antage of the recent sequencing of the Z. lateralis genome [53] to map reads back onto this reference with
A MEM (v. 0.7.12) [54], instead of creating consensuses directly from data as in [39]. We aligned contigs and
folds from Z. lateralis on the Zebra Finch genome (version July 2008, assembly WUGSC v.3.2.4) using
TZ [55]. We removed PCR duplicates using samtools [56]. SNPs were called using Popoolation2 (v1.201)
. (Line 196)
enotyping by sequencing (GBS) using individual DNA samples
further validated the results obtained by the pooled RAD-seq approach by performing a genotyping by
encing analysis [40] on 42 individuals from the same populations that were used to build the pooled DNA
ples (7 individuals per morph per population for a total of 14 individuals in each population). Approximately
microgram of DNA was extracted with a QIAGEN Blood and Tissue kit following manufacturer’s
ructions and sent to the BRC Genomic Diversity Facility at Cornell University [40]. Reads were trimmed with
mmomatic (v0.33) and mapped on Z. lateralis genome using BWA. SNPs were called using freebayes (v0.9.15-
nd filtered with VCFTOOLS (0.1.12b) using the following criteria: i) a mean sequencing depth between 6 and
; ii) a minimal genotype quality of 20; iii) a minor allele count of 3, which resulted in around 25,000
mbiguous SNPs.”

195: the description of this PCA is too vague. PCA is commonly used to reduce dimensionality of continuous
ables into a smaller number of factors that explain variance in the original variables.
can it be applied to these data?
is a standard tool to describe the genetic structure of populations (Menozzi P, Piazza A, Cavalli-Sforza L.
hetic maps of human gene frequencies in Europeans. Science. 1978;201:786–792). The variables that are
idered are genotypes or allele frequencies (for pools) at each locus. Since demography acts on allele
uencies at all loci in a similar way, there is a lot of redundant information that can be effectively summarized by
.
at was the purpose?
main goal here was to illustrate the lack of genetic structure between color morphs. If morphs constituted
nct genetic groups, pools or individuals from the same morph should group together in the PCA. Instead,
ps were consistent with geographic localities, suggesting that geography accounted for more variation than
phs.
was it exactly made?
did the components relate to allele frequencies?
construction of PCA axes mostly follow the standard procedure, using the scaled matrix (individuals by SNPs)
enotypes or allele frequencies. Further description can be found in the reference “Population Structure and
nanalysis”, Patterson et al., PloS Genetics, 2006. Patterson et al is now cited.
at was the meaning of the components and how much variance did the most important PCs accounted for?
added the proportion of variance explained by each axis on the figure 2A (5.62% and 5.55% for GBS;
2% and 18.51% for pooled data).
is the % reported along the axis names in Fig. B (but not in Fig. 2A)?
A. depicts the results of a different PCA analysis based on spectrophotometry data in order to describe
ation in plumage colour.
y did you consider only PC1 and PC2?
checked other PC axes, but those are mostly associated to individual variation. In addition, PCA were mostly
to illustrate the lack of strong genetic structure between color morphs. A formal test of the non-significance of
etic structure between morphs has been conducted with a molecular analysis of variance (AMOVA).
3: please explain what ‘decibans’ are.
added this paragraph (L231):
cibans is a commonly used statistic that describes here the probability that data is produced under a given
el. They are often used as a unit for Bayes factors. Here, it describes the odds of association to morphs v. the
hypothesis of non-association.”
3: as for the other genomic analyses, more details should be provided here about WGS (again, these are
ided in the Suppl. Mat., but poorly referenced in the text).
have now moved these details from Supplem Materials to the main text and have referenced Table S4 for
nstructed pedigrees of the individuals used in the analysis
5: please report full statistics, naked p-values are useless (i.e. F and degrees of freedom).

8: Spearman’s rho = 0.834
ed
9: ...by individual GBS data: where is this shown? Please refer to a table, figure, or the like! Please check for
er referencing of Suppl. Mat. into the main text (see also above)!
modified the text as follows so that this becomes clearer:
is pattern was further confirmed by individual GBS data, with which seven variants were found to be
ciated to colouration with an uncorrected p-value between 9.1x10-5 and 8.6x10-7 on scaffold 40, while only 2
r variants were found to be associated with similar levels of significance on scaffold 172, which is directly
ream from scaffold 40 according to the zebra finch reference genome. "(Line 330)
6: grey (not ‘gray’)
ed
4: chromosome 1 characterized by SNPs strongly
ed
8: regions previously associated...colour morhps in other species
larify what we wanted to say, we rephrased this sentence as follows:
notation of these SNPs using the Z. lateralis reference genome [53] did not reveal any non-synonymous
ations or deletions in coding parts of the genomic region associated with variation between colour morphs,
cating that functionally important nucleotide changes in the Reunion grey white-eye must lie outside coding
ons." (Line 378)
9: italicize cis-?

3: again, these mysterious ‘morphometric’-based analyses appear here. See previous comments. Please clarify.
