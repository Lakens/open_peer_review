Major points :
If the introduction section was well conducted and documented, some problems arise in the last
paragraph.
“ As balance [..] effectively” : this sentence remains unclear. Why “is it not realistic” ? And why is the
handstand an interesting alternative posture to understand upright stance ?
But the most critical problem is that there’s no hypothesis. And then I’m not sure to understand what is the
aim of the study : “understand how the CNS attempts to control balance” or “determine the prevalent
strategies to retain balance” in different postures ? Another consequence is that the justification of the
chosen DV also remains unclear (see below)
Minor points :
Maybe more than national level, the uses of classical criteria (Erisson et al. 1993) to describe participants
should be used.
The hip, ankle and knee strategies are well known but are there references describing the different
strategies in handstand? It could be useful to build an hypothesis
In the first cited reference, the authors give a description of a complex system (self-organization,
emergence, etc.). Does this study allow to understand postural control as a complex system as defined by
Bardy et al, 99) (L. 100-101)?
The use of ANOVA on percentage is always problematic but not crippling. Nevertheless in this study, a
supplementary problem arises. Indeed, because the authors chose to analyze separately the percentage of
each strategy as DV, it is not possible to determinate how much a strategy is preferably used in a specific
condition. For example in figure 6: if the percentage of primary strategy decreases (top left, forward, large
perturbation), the percentage of another strategy necessarily increases (top right) (i.e. the sum is necessarily
equal to 100%). Therefore, the reader should be informed about the different use of every single strategy
according to every conditions (is or not significant). This information is nor provided in the manuscript
neither in the supplementary data section.
Is the hip strategy significantly less used than the non significant strategy in unperturbed condition (table
2)?
Discussion : The almost total absence of ankle strategy in erected posture in perturbed condition is a bit
surprising according to the literature. According to the author the reason is that the recruited participants
were elite gymnasts. If these participants are not representative of the average population how to
generalize the conclusions for standing conditions?

The manuscript discusses a study investigating the motor control strategies (ankle, knee, and hip)
associated with standing and hand-stand postures during perturbations. Time varying patterns of joint
torques were assessed to represent synergy of motor control utilizing moving platform to deliver balance
perturbations during standing and hand-standing postures with eyes open and closed. The results
indicated that standing balance (or postural stability during standing quietly and during perturbation) was
dominated by ankle strategy, and for hand-stand posture, the wrist strategy. Although a better
understanding of how the CNS attempts to control postural stability during these events can be important
in terms of biomechanics and human motor control literature, it is unclear how one can use this
information to aide in population prone to falling as the population studied are athletes. Some major
issues that may be addressed prior to publication are;
1. Introduction – very nicely done. However, reads much like the dissertation and a book rather
than a scientific journal – elaborate on the importance of this understanding in helping our lives – and to
the scientific community –to answer “ so what ?” questions such as “so what if only one strategy is used in
postural control by the elite athletes? Does this generalize to the fall prone elderly?
2. Methods – some of the inverse dynamics methods were not elaborated – upon searching the
dissertation, appears to have a significant amount of details – which will need to be paraphrased here.
3. Results: Please elaborate on movement frequencies associated with postural stability during quite
standing and during perturbations. Given this information, compare the 1 second window of data that you
captured to those movements (that may be occurring faster than 1 second window can capture). Discuss
this differences in lieu of your findings.
4. Please synthesize the findings and elaborate on limitations such as use of gymnasts to generalize
motor control strategies.

Appendix A
The authors would like to thank the editor and reviewers for their time and helpful
comments. Responses to specific comments are given below. Altered text relating to
specific comments is in blue in the manuscript and repeated here for clarity.
Reviewer: 1
Comment – If the introduction section was well conducted and documented, some
problems arise in the last paragraph. “As balance [..] effectively”: this sentence
remains unclear. Why “is it not realistic”? And why is the handstand an interesting
alternative posture to understand upright stance?
Response – As requested changes have been made to the introduction, due to
these changes this sentence is no longer present. New text is on lines 94-128.
New text – Although ankle and hip strategies in standing balance have been
identified, and some studies have described how one strategy may be preferred over
another in different situations, the cause for this preference is less clear. Kuo [12]
created a constrained model of human balance based on feasible acceleration sets
to examine the cost of activating muscles to control posture. The model predicted
that, for a given magnitude of horizontal acceleration, the hip strategy is most
effective at controlling the COM with minimal muscle activation [12, 18]. In addition,
the hip strategy is faster and can tolerate greater time latencies before becoming
unstable [18]. The hip strategy appears to be more robust and more efficient than the
ankle strategy, which might explain why it is used during perturbed conditions, but
does not explain why it is not used during unperturbed conditions. However, for
many goals maximising efficiency does not involve a simple minimisation of effort
[19]. Ricco and Stoffregen [19] explain how uncontrolled motion of the perception
and action systems can hinder their function. For example, the increased head
movement resulting from a hip strategy will require a larger compensatory eye
movement than that resulting from an ankle strategy. This interaction between an
organism and the environment, and specifically the goals of additional task being
performed, can constrain which control strategy may be employed and may explain
why an ankle strategy is preferred during unconstrained standing. What, therefore,
would this suggest for balance control in postures other than upright standing?
Examining various postures and discovering common invariant traits in the way
control strategies are implemented could aid understanding of how the CNS
attempts to control balance. Handstand balance performed by experienced
gymnasts provides an alternative perspective to normal upright stance for
understanding this complex system [20].
In handstand the task is to keep the body in an inverted posture, supported by the
hands, with anteroposterior motion primarily controlled by a wrist strategy, which can
be considered equivalent to the ankle strategy in standing [13,21]. Furthermore,
other control strategies can be called upon, with a hip strategy in standing being
equivalent to a shoulder or hip strategy in handstand [13]. However, while in
standing a hip strategy can result in large movements of the head, significantly
affecting perception and action coupling, in the handstand posture the use of a
shoulder or hip strategy results in very little movement of the head. Why then is the
wrist strategy still dominant during unperturbed handstand balance, and how will this
change during perturbed conditions?
Comment – But the most critical problem is that there’s no hypothesis. And then I’m
not sure to understand what is the aim of the study: “understand how the CNS
attempts to control balance” or “determine the prevalent strategies to retain balance”
in different postures? Another consequence is that the justification of the chosen DV
also remains unclear (see below)
Response – A hypothesis has been added to the introduction [lines 131-136] and
addressed in the discussion [lines 315-318].
New text in introduction – It is hypothesised that the preferred control strategy in
unperturbed balance is a single segment control strategy, with control about the
ankle in standing and the wrist in handstand. During perturbed balance, it is
hypothesised that this preferred control strategy will be substituted for one which can
respond more quickly resulting in a hip strategy in standing and an elbow, shoulder,
or hip strategy in handstand.
New text in discussion – It was hypothesised that the preferred control strategy in
unperturbed balance would be a single segment control strategy, but during
perturbed balance this would be substituted for a strategy that responds more
quickly, such as a hip or shoulder strategy.
Comment – Maybe more than national level, the uses of classical criteria (Ericsson
et al. 1993) to describe participants should be used.
Response – The level of expertise of the gymnasts used in this study is not an
essential criterion, what is more important is their ability to balance in the handstand
position, judged to be sufficient if they can hold a static handstand for at least 30
seconds. To avoid confusion the words ‘nation level’ have been removed from the
first sentence, and a little more information regarding the experience of the gymnasts
has been added to the second sentence [lines: 142-147].
New text – All gymnasts had over 10 years’ experience of structured training and
competitive gymnastics at national level, and could balance in the handstand
position for at least 30 seconds whilst maintaining a static base of support.
Comment – The hip, ankle and knee strategies are well known but are there
references describing the different strategies in handstand?
Response – New text has been added in the introduction to cover this point on lines
119-124.
New text – In handstand the task is to keep the body in an inverted posture,
supported by the hands, with anteroposterior motion primarily controlled by a wrist
strategy, which can be considered equivalent to the ankle strategy in standing
[13,21]. Furthermore, other control strategies can be called upon, with a hip strategy
in standing being equivalent to a shoulder or hip strategy in handstand [13].
Comment – It could be useful to build an hypothesis In the first cited reference, the
authors give a description of a complex system (self-organization, emergence, etc.).
Does this study allow to understand postural control as a complex system as defined
by Bardy et al, 99) (L. 100-101)?
Response – This study does not relate to the understanding of postural control as a
complex system as defined by Bardy et al., but relates more to general control
strategies. This may be interpreted more in lines of constraints, which has been
introduced with the new reference Ricco and Stoffregen (1988) on lines 105-113 of
the introduction and directly referenced to Newell on lines 366-370 of the discussion.
New text – However, for many goals, maximising efficiency does not involve a
simple minimisation of effort [19]. Ricco and Stoffregen [19] explain how uncontrolled
motion of the perception and action systems can hinder their function. For example,
the increased head movement resulting from a hip strategy will require a larger
compensatory eye movement than that resulting from an ankle strategy. This
interaction between an organism and the environment, and specifically the goals of
additional task being performed, can constrain which control strategy may be
employed and may explain why an ankle strategy is preferred during unconstrained
standing.
Comment – The use of ANOVA on percentage is always problematic but not
crippling. Nevertheless, in this study, a supplementary problem arises. Indeed,
because the authors chose to analyze separately the percentage of each strategy as
DV, it is not possible to determinate how much a strategy is preferably used in a
specific condition. For example, in figure 6: if the percentage of primary strategy
decreases (top left, forward, large perturbation), the percentage of another strategy
necessarily increases (top right) (i.e. the sum is necessarily equal to 100%).
Therefore, the reader should be informed about the different use of every single
strategy according to every condition (is or not significant). This information is nor
provided in the manuscript neither in the supplementary data section.
Response – We agree that there is a potential issue with using an ANOVA to
analyse percentage data that is linked, as we have done here. We are aware of the
work by Aitchison on the constant sum or closure problem, using log ratios to
remove the dependency between groups so that correlation analysis can be used.
However, it is unclear how this method can be adjusted to allow an ANOVA to be
used to examine differences between multiple groups and levels as required in the
current study. Throughout the discussion we have limited our interpretations to the
dominant control strategy as much as possible, or tried to explain that changes in
one strategy would result in some changes to another strategy [lines 335-338]. We
have also tried not to infer too much from comparisons across conditions which
relied on small changes. However, we agree with the reviewer that at the very least
this uncertainty should be communicated to the reader more explicitly, therefore new
text has been added to lines 242-249 and we have added extra results to tables 2
and 3.
New text – Control strategies in the present study have been converted to a
percentage of the trial time. Although necessary, this results in what is known as the
constant sum problem, whereby different components of the data become
dependent, introducing a negative bias into correlations (Aitchison, 1982; Rollinson,
1992). Therefore, further analysis will focus mainly on the primary control strategy,
and the reader is advised to be cautious with interpreting changes in other control
strategies which are likely a consequence of the primary control strategy also
changing.
Comment – Is the hip strategy significantly less used than the non-significant
strategy in unperturbed condition (table 2)?
Response – Yes. This may be in part due to the width of the non-significant region,
which will register as a non-significant strategy for short periods of time when moving
from one strategy to another. This may become elevated when one strategy is only
used for very short periods of time before moving back to the dominant strategy.
Comment – Discussion: The almost total absence of ankle strategy in erected
posture in perturbed condition is a bit surprising according to the literature. According
to the author the reason is that the recruited participants were elite gymnasts. If
these participants are not representative of the average population how to generalize
the conclusions for standing conditions?
Response – The ankle strategy is still the most dominant in perturbed standing
(Table 2). The reason gymnasts were used in this study was because we wanted to
assess both the nature of control strategies in both standing and handstand
postures, and we felt this was best examined within the same group of people. We
are not trying to generalise to any particular population, but rather to examine the
fundamental nature of control strategies in multiple tasks/postures.

Comment – Introduction – very nicely done. However, reads much like the
dissertation and a book rather than a scientific journal – elaborate on the importance
of this understanding in helping our lives – and to the scientific community –to
answer “so what?” questions such as “so what if only one strategy is used in postural
control by the elite athletes? Does this generalize to the fall prone elderly?
Response – As requested changes have been made to the introduction on lines 94-
128.
New text – Although ankle and hip strategies in standing balance have been
identified, and some studies have described how one strategy may be preferred over
another in different situations, the cause for this preference is less clear. Kuo [12]
created a constrained model of human balance based on feasible acceleration sets
to examine the cost of activating muscles to control posture. The model predicted
that, for a given magnitude of horizontal acceleration, the hip strategy is most
effective at controlling the COM with minimal muscle activation [12, 18]. In addition,
the hip strategy is faster and can tolerate greater time latencies before becoming
unstable [18]. The hip strategy appears to be more robust and more efficient than the
ankle strategy, which might explain why it is used during perturbed conditions, but
does not explain why it is not used during unperturbed conditions. However, for
many goals maximising efficiency does not involve a simple minimisation of effort
[19]. Ricco and Stoffregen [19] explain how uncontrolled motion of the perception
and action systems can hinder their function. For example, the increased head
movement resulting from a hip strategy will require a larger compensatory eye
movement than that resulting from an ankle strategy. This interaction between an
organism and the environment, and specifically the goals of additional task being
performed, can constrain which control strategy may be employed and may explain
why an ankle strategy is preferred during unconstrained standing. What, therefore,
would this suggest for balance control in postures other than upright standing?
Examining various postures and discovering common invariant traits in the way
control strategies are implemented could aid understanding of how the CNS
attempts to control balance. Handstand balance performed by experienced
gymnasts provides an alternative perspective to normal upright stance for
understanding this complex system [20].
In handstand the task is to keep the body in an inverted posture, supported by the
hands, with anteroposterior motion primarily controlled by a wrist strategy, which can
be considered equivalent to the ankle strategy in standing [13,21]. Furthermore,
other control strategies can be called upon, with a hip strategy in standing being
equivalent to a shoulder or hip strategy in handstand [13]. However, while in
standing a hip strategy can result in large movements of the head, significantly
affecting perception and action coupling, in the handstand posture the use of a
shoulder or hip strategy results in very little movement of the head. Why then is the
wrist strategy still dominant during unperturbed handstand balance, and how will this
change during perturbed conditions?
Comment – Methods – some of the inverse dynamics methods were not elaborated
– upon searching the dissertation, appears to have a significant amount of details –
which will need to be paraphrased here.
Response – Using inverse dynamics to calculate joint torques is standard in
biomechanics, and referencing standard methods is common practice. Adding
inverse dynamics details would add an extra level of information to the methods that
we feel would distract from the processing and interpretation of the outputs from the
inverse dynamics, which is of higher importance in the present study. The method
used in the current paper is taken from previously published work which has been
referenced on lines 196 and 197 [Dumas, R., Aissaoui, R., and De Guise, J. A.
(2004). A 3D generic inverse dynamic method using wrench notation and quaternion
algebra. Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering, 7(3), 159-
166.]
Comment – Results: Please elaborate on movement frequencies associated with
postural stability during quite standing and during perturbations. Given this
information, compare the 1 second window of data that you captured to those
movements (that may be occurring faster than 1 second window can capture).
Discuss this difference in lieu of your findings.
Response – Thank you, this is a good observation which we feel improves the
paper. Text has been added to lines 391-408.
New text – This was considered appropriate as previous research has shown that
80% of the COP power spectral density is below 0.5 Hz for standing balance in
young and elderly adults [36,37]. However, these analyses were based on the
trajectory of the COP, whereas the analysis of the present study was based on
torques at multiple joints. Frequency analysis of all joint torques showed that peak
power spectral density and median frequencies occurred well below 0.5 Hz for all
conditions. Consequently, the analysis of one second moving windows will identify
the dominant control strategies during balance trials. Although some joint torques are
likely to contain frequencies above the analysis resolution of 1 Hz, this will have
minimal effect on the ability to detect control strategies, unless it is significantly
higher than 1 Hz. Nevertheless, it is possible that a small number of control
strategies were employed for very short periods of time and were not detected due to
the limited time resolution. For example, it may be possible that during short periods
of instability a hip strategy may be employed in a single burst of less than half a
second to return balance to a region preferred by an ankle strategy. Future research
in this area may wish to explore different time windows, or employ other methods
with improved time-frequency resolution, such as wavelet analysis.
Comment – Please synthesize the findings and elaborate on limitations such as use
of gymnasts to generalize motor control strategies.
Response – Our findings relate to the motor control strategies employed by the
subjects in perturbed and unperturbed balance in standing and handstand. It was not
our intent to generalise our findings to other populations, such as the fall prone
elderly, but rather to examine if the same general control strategies could be
observed in standing and handstand tasks.
