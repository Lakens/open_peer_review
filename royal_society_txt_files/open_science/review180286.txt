I thoroughly enjoyed reading this article. It is well written, concise and scholarly. I think the
paper is very timely and provides much-needed information on the ecology of manganese nodule
fields in the deep ocean that are targeted for future mining operations.
My only suggestion for improvement would be to possibly strengthen the case that the features
shown in the imagery are most likely beaked whale feeding pits (gouges) by adding published
existing imagery alongside of Fig. 4. The figures from Woodside et al (2006) show examples very
similar to the pits in Fig. 4. I also noted the text in Woodside et al (2006) describes very similar
dimensions for the gouges and the pattern of two or three "gouges in a row, about 5-10 m apart".
Otherwise, I recommend publication of the article in its present form.

This paper reports evidence that some large fauna may be interacting with the abyssal sea floor
and leaving grooves in the sediment, the first such indications at depths > 3000m and in an area
targeted for mineral extraction. The central theme is important and timely: we know so little
about the communities that live on the deep sea floor or that rely on the resources there that we
can form no reasonable prediction about the impact of sea floor mining. The paper concludes that
3
the precautionary principle should be invoked in managing exploitation of the deep sea until we
have a better idea of the biological processes that might be affected.
The paper draws on two previous studies that report broadly similar grooves and which
speculate that they may be caused by deep diving beaked whales performing a bottom foraging
behaviour. Such behaviour has not been observed although this is unsurprising given the scant
data from these species. Beaked whales seem like a reasonable possibility in the context of the
two previous papers which report smaller grooves at significantly shallower depths on
submarine volcanoes or canyons. Such bathymetric features are often associated with upwelling
water that may improve the accessibility and abundance of prey for deep-diving whales. In
contrast, the current paper reports larger grooves, occuring at depths that greatly exceed the
observed dive depths of beaked whales (although again, this is based on few data) and in an area
with little apparent food resources to reward such phenomenal breath-hold dives. To me, these
factors suggest that serious consideration should be given to demersal fish species or other bathy-
pelagic fauna before concluding for beaked whales. After all, we know very little about what is
down there and the evidence for beaked whales is very thin. The implications of deep-sea mining
will likely remain just as dire to whatever is producing the grooves.
To conclude, the paper presents an important and timely observation but I consider that the
lengthy speculations about beaked whale behaviour should be abridged and complemented with
a more circumspect consideration of potential actors.
Line 16: 'evidence ... of large vertebrates interacting with the sea-floor' is too strong. You have
found marks in the sea-floor that could conceivably be produced by large vertebrates.
Line 18: The grooves reported here are 2-3 x the size of those in previous reports and so are only
broadly comparable. The depth and bathymetric features of your environment are also quite
different from those reports.
Line 49: Again, this is not evidence of large vertebrates.
Line 51-53: Only very broadly comparable as discussed above.
Line 82-84: These criteria seem arbitrary. How many isolated depressions (i.e., not allocated to
'tracks') were found?
Line 129: State what those inconsistencies are, i.e., a factor of 2-3 in size. This paragraph seems to
be sweeping some relevant issues under the rug. How beaked whales, which are named for their
distinctively slender rostra, can produce groves of 1m average width when grubbing needs to be
addressed. The differences in depth and habitat compared to the two cited reports on 'beaked
whale grooves' should also be discussed here.
Line 153-154: This reference only considers the hearing anatomy. It is unknown what depth
beaked whales or sperm whales can or do attain.
Line 135-207: There are 70-some lines of pure speculation here which add essentially no strength
to the argument for or against an odontocete producing the grooves. The arguments here re-
present and expand on speculations in the two previous reports on the same topic. I think it
would be more productive to discuss what other type of fauna might produce the observed
features and perhaps how one might go about collecting more evidence. For example, if the
grooves are scrapes, perhaps eDNA of skin fragments in the sediment might help identify the
taxa.
Line 209: 'conclusively' is a little ambitious here.
There are a number of incomplete references: numbers 42 and 43 are examples.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors have attended to most of the issues that were raised in the previous review although
incompletely in some cases. I appreciate that the authors have toned down the assertions that
beaked whales must be responsible for the grooves and have abbreviated their speculations about
foraging implications (with the exception of the last few paragraphs of the discussion). There are
still some minor issues that need to be taken care of, as outlined below, but I would recommend
publication if these are resolved.
Line 85: You explained these selection criteria well in your response to reviewer comments, but
the criterion for 6 sequential depressions is still unjustified in the text. I suggest you add a brief
comment explaining why this number was chosen.
Line 145: This is good but please, as I requested previously, state the inconsistencies in size and
shape. e.g., Woodside et al. (2006) describe a central groove some 10cm wide and 5-10cm deep
surrounded by a gently sloping 0.5-1.0 m wide bowl. Only the latter feature appears to concur
with observations in the current paper.
Line168: I reiterate my comment in the last review that the Cranford paper only refers to cranial
anatomy. Evidently there must be a whole slew of physiological factors that also constrain dive
depth. I strongly recommend changing 'Results from anatomical studies reveal that an extant
species of beaked whale could be capable of diving to depths of 5000 m' to: 'Anatomical studies
suggest that cranial air spaces in Cuvier's beaked whales could withstand a dive to depths of 5000
m but the physiological limits of diving are unknown.'
Line 172: 'why whales cause' change to 'why whales may cause'
Line 186-190: This is a bit misleading. The fish described in the cited stomach contents for
Berardius and Ziphius are much shallower living. To my knowledge, no deep-bathyal/abyssal
species have been reported.
Line 190-192: I am not clear why it is 'unlikely' that the 'sequential tracks are a by-product of
whale chasing prey...' Use of echolocation and suction does not avoid a chase (e.g., Aguilar de
Soto et al. Animal Ecology 2008 - pilot whales use suction and echolocation). Could this be a
typo?
Line 199-201:
Line 206: In the paper cited (Martin Lopez et al. 2016) only one of the three beaked whale species
analysed appears to be close to neutrally bouyant at depth (this was Cuvier's). All three species
use the unique stroke and glide pattern so this does not appear to be closely connected with
bouyancy.
Line 206-208: '...evolutionarily designed to forage optimally at depth' This will raise the hackles of
many biologists. Evolution neither designs nor optimises.You are also conflating a range of very
different niches in the theme of deep foraging: capability to forage efficiently in the mesopelagic
does not imply similar efficiency in the bathy- or deep bentho-pelagic.
Line 208: That I know of, sediment and rocks have not been reported in stomach contents of
Cuvier's beaked whales and other smaller beaked whale species. In fairness, this should be
9
mentioned alongside the interesting Baird's beaked whale observation.
Lines 194-213: 20 lines on geophagy is definitely more than the data and literature on this topic
deserve. I recommend you combine this material into a single short paragraph. Most of the
commentary on bouyancy and biomechanical strategies in swimming is non-conclusive and
highly speculative. A diet including benthic organisms seems sufficient to account for the gravel
reported by Walker et al. 2002, as they themselves conclude.
Line 216-218: What physiological evidence? You have only cited a paper that says that the head
shouldn't cave in! Also there are only 5 beaked whale species in the CCZ according to your line
155. The implications for management remain the same whatever megafauna is responsible so
this sentence should be broadened and the assertion about capabilities should be dropped.
Line 230-237: This paragraph is taking as proven that whales are responsible for the gouges,
abandoning the more measured tone that the rest of the paper mostly now adopts. Given that
you cannot conclude what animal is producing the gouges, it is hard to argue that AUVs and
ROVs will be key new technologies for studying cetacean behaviour. These tools will certainly be
useful for assessing the extent of these sea-floor interactions, whatever the taxa involved, and
therefore will help understand the potential impacts of deep sea mining on deep-sea trophic
webs. I suggest you adapt this paragraph accordingly.

mentioned alongside the interesting Baird's beaked whale observation.
Lines 194-213: 20 lines on geophagy is definitely more than the data and literature on this topic
deserve. I recommend you combine this material into a single short paragraph. Most of the
commentary on bouyancy and biomechanical strategies in swimming is non-conclusive and
highly speculative. A diet including benthic organisms seems sufficient to account for the gravel
reported by Walker et al. 2002, as they themselves conclude.
Line 216-218: What physiological evidence? You have only cited a paper that says that the head
shouldn't cave in! Also there are only 5 beaked whale species in the CCZ according to your line
13
155. The implications for management remain the same whatever megafauna is responsible so
this sentence should be broadened and the assertion about capabilities should be dropped.
Line 230-237: This paragraph is taking as proven that whales are responsible for the gouges,
abandoning the more measured tone that the rest of the paper mostly now adopts. Given that
you cannot conclude what animal is producing the gouges, it is hard to argue that AUVs and
ROVs will be key new technologies for studying cetacean behaviour. These tools will certainly be
useful for assessing the extent of these sea-floor interactions, whatever the taxa involved, and
therefore will help understand the potential impacts of deep sea mining on deep-sea trophic
webs. I suggest you adapt this paragraph accordingly.

Comments to the Author(s)
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this article. It is well written, concise and scholarly. I think the paper is very timely
and provides much-needed information on the ecology of manganese nodule fields in the deep ocean that are
targeted for future mining operations.
My only suggestion for improvement would be to possibly strengthen the case that the features shown in the
magery are most likely beaked whale feeding pits (gouges) by adding published existing imagery alongside of
Fig. 4.
The figures from Woodside et al (2006) show examples very similar to the pits in Fig. 4. I also noted the text in
Woodside et al (2006) describes very similar dimensions for the gouges and the pattern of two or three "gouges
n a row, about 5-10 m apart".
Otherwise, I recommend publication of the article in its present form.
Authors response to Reviewer 1’s general comments:
The authors would like to thank Reviewer 1 for their positive comments and their support in the
publication of this manuscript in its “present form”. We acknowledge their comments regarding the
similarities between the gouges and patterns presented in Woodside et al., (2006) and have added text in
line (now) 142-143, which highlights this explicitly.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
This paper reports evidence that some large fauna may be interacting with the abyssal sea floor and leaving
grooves in the sediment, the first such indications at depths > 3000m and in an area targeted for mineral
extraction. The central theme is important and timely: we know so little about the communities that live on the
deep sea floor or that rely on the resources there that we can form no reasonable prediction about the impact of
sea floor mining. The paper concludes that the precautionary principle should be invoked in managing
exploitation of the deep sea until we have a better idea of the biological processes that might be affected.
The paper draws on two previous studies that report broadly similar grooves and which speculate that they may
be caused by deep diving beaked whales performing a bottom foraging behaviour. Such behaviour has not been
observed although this is unsurprising given the scant data from these species. Beaked whales seem like a
reasonable possibility in the context of the two previous papers which report smaller grooves at significantly
shallower depths on submarine volcanoes or canyons. Such bathymetric features are often associated with
upwelling water that may improve the accessibility and abundance of prey for deep-diving whales. In contrast, the
current paper reports larger grooves, occuring at depths that greatly exceed the observed dive depths of beaked
whales (although again, this is based on few data) and in an area with little apparent food resources to reward
such phenomenal breath-hold dives. To me, these factors suggest that serious consideration should be given to
demersal fish species or other bathy-pelagic fauna before concluding for beaked whales. After all, we know very
ittle about what is down there and the evidence for beaked whales is very thin. The implications of deep-sea
mining will likely remain just as dire to whatever is producing the grooves.
To conclude, the paper presents an important and timely observation but I consider that the lengthy speculations
about beaked whale behaviour should be abridged and complemented with a more circumspect consideration of
potential actors.
Authors response to Reviewer 2’s general comments:
The authors would like to thank Reviewer 2 for their constructive comments. The reviewer acknowledges
that beaked whales seem a “reasonable possibility” based on the published literature but has the
following general concerns:
“Beaked whales seem like a reasonable possibility in the context of the two previous papers which report smaller
grooves at significantly shallower depths on submarine volcanoes or canyons. Such bathymetric features are
often associated with upwelling water that may improve the accessibility and abundance of prey for deep-diving
whales. In contrast, the current paper reports larger grooves, occurring at depths that greatly exceed the
observed dive depths of beaked whales (although again, this is based on few data) and in an area with
ittle apparent food resources to reward such phenomenal breath-hold dives.”
The authors agree that such topographic features are a source of upwelling and a potential food source
for some species of deep diving cetacean. However, as stated in Milligan et al., (2016) and cited in line
187, there is a significant food resource at depth beyond 4000m. The larger size of the gouges presented
in this paper has been discussed in lines 129-137 and again in comments below.
“….that serious consideration should be given to demersal fish species or other bathy-pelagic fauna
before concluding for beaked whales.”
The authors believe that they have given serious consideration to other possible vertebrate species,
specifically fish. The sequential curvilinear patterns of depressions would suggest that each track is
made by one individual. If a bentho-pelagic fish was to make sequential gouges on the seafloor, it would
need a high-locomotory capacity, and use its full body to be able to achieve such sequential depressions
in the seafloor. As mentioned in line 188-192, swimming speeds of Macrouridae reported from the North
Pacific (specifically, Coryphaenoides armatus, length 102cm and Coryphaenoides yaquinae, length
77cm) reach <15cms-1. Based on the published literature, we would therefore suggest a fish is likely not
responsible for creating these gouges.
To address the reviewer’s concerns, the authors have added the following paragraph to the discussion at
lines 127-135
“There is no direct evidence for the cause of the depressions. No known geological mechanism exists
for the formation of curvilinear sequences of shallow depressions in deep water with no advective
seabed fluid flow expected in sediments with low permeability (22). The size and frequency of depression
suggests that only a large organism could be responsible. The largest fish species (<1.02m) known to
inhabit these water depths in the Pacific are Coryphaenoides armatus and Coryphaenoides yaquinae
(23). These species of abyssal fish have reduced locomotory capacity (24) and slow swimming speeds
(<0.15 ms-1) (25) and are unlikely to be able to create relatively deep, sequential depressions in clay
sediments (20) several times longer than their body lengths. Complex behaviours associated with
nesting (26) have not been observed in deep-sea fishes and would be energetically extremely costly to
make in this environment. “
As for other bathy-pelagic fauna, other than deep-diving cetaceans, such as the beaked whales or
sperm whale, the authors have conducted a thorough literature review and can find no further evidence
to suggest an alternate perpetrator.
Authors response to Reviewer 2’s specific comments:
Line 16: 'evidence ... of large vertebrates interacting with the sea-floor' is too strong. You have found marks in
the sea-floor that could conceivably be produced by large vertebrates.
Agreed. We have no direct evidence. The wording in line 16 has been changed to reflect the reviewer’s
comments. “Here we report seafloor geomorphological alterations from autonomous underwater vehicle
surveys that suggest large vertebrates could have interacted with the seafloor to a maximum depth of 4258m
n the recent geological past.”
Line 18: The grooves reported here are 2-3 x the size of those in previous reports and so are only broadly
comparable. The depth and bathymetric features of your environment are also quite different from those
reports.
In lines 140-149, the authors discuss why there may be inconsistencies in the size of the depressions.
We have changed line 18 in the abstract to also reflect this. “Patterns of disturbance on the seafloor
are broadly comparable to those recorded in other regions of the world’s oceans attributed to beaked
whales.”
Line 49: Again, this is not evidence of large
vertebrates.
Agreed. We have no direct evidence. The wording in line (now) 50 has been changed to reflect the
reviewer’s comments. “This paper suggests that large vertebrates have utilised the abyssal seafloor in
the CCZ in the recent geological past.”
Line 51-53: Only very broadly comparable as discussed
above.
The authors believe that line 51-53 address the broad comparison sufficiently. We suggest that the
patterns are spatially comparable, and that the morphology is “akin” to those inferred from beaked
whales. This concurs with the published literature. Woodside et al., (2006) state a size of 1-2m long (here
we report a mean 2.57m) 0.5-1m wide (here we report a mean 0.97m) and spaced 5-10m apart (here we
report between 6 and 13 m apart). The authors believe these values are comparable.
Line 82-84: These criteria seem arbitrary. How many isolated depressions (i.e., not allocated to 'tracks') were
found?
Owing to collection and processing of sidescan sonar data, these objective criteria were designed to
assess the spatial patterns of the depressions within a given track across all AUV missions where tracks
were detected. We believe all depressions observed form part of a track and are not in isolation. As the
detection of depressions varies with the quality of the sidescan, not all tracks were easily resolved by
eye and the following criteria were determined:
(a) contain ³6 sequential depressions – this would give a minimum 5 mid-point to mid-point
distances per track. (the authors note that there was a typo here and the number of depressions
was ³6 with there being a minimum of 5 distances calculated – text has been corrected in the
manuscript.)
In the supplementary information, the editor will note that for M83 and M85 only 1 and 2 tracks
were detected respectively. Both of these sets of tracks had a minimum number of 6
depressions (i.e. 5 mid-point to mid-point distances). As a result, 6 depressions was set as the
minimum for M79 and M80. For M79, only 8 tracks did not meet the objective criteria, whereas for
M80, all tracks detected met these criteria.
(b) not cross the nadir of the geophysical survey – the nadir is the centre region of the sidescan
data which represents the transit of the sonar signal through the water column. If a track
crosses the nadir, a depression may not have been detected in the region of the seafloor in
which the nadir occurs which would result in an incorrect distance between depressions being
calculated.
The authors have added further detail in line 84 - 87 to clarify. “These tracks had to fit the following criteria
(a) contain ³6 sequential depressions (minimum number of sequential depressions observed from a single
track in sidescan data from M83) and; (b) not cross the nadir (centre region of the sidescan data which
represents the transit of the sonar signal through the water column) of the geophysical survey.”
Line 129: State what those inconsistencies are, i.e., a factor of 2-3 in size. This paragraph seems to be sweeping
some relevant issues under the rug. How beaked whales, which are named for their distinctively slender rostra,
can produce groves of 1m average width when grubbing needs to be addressed. The differences in depth and
habitat compared to the two cited reports on 'beaked whale grooves' should also be discussed here.
As stated in line 144, the authors note that there are 5 species of extant beaked whale and the sperm
whale, that are present in the CCZ. Those species include; Longman’s beaked whale (Indopacetus
pacificus); Ginkgo-toothed beaked whale (Mesoplodon ginkgodens); Blainville’s beaked whale
(Mesoplodon densirostris); Baird’s beaked whale (Berardius bairdii); and finally; Cuvier’s beaked whale
(Ziphius cavirostris). These beaked whales vary in size, with Baird’s beaked whale (Berardius bairdii)
attaining lengths up to 12m. At no point do the authors suggest that the gouges in the Mediterranean are
made by the same species as those in the Pacific.
Furthermore, inspection of the lower jaws of both Berardius bairdii and Ziphius cavirostris specimens, at
the Natural History Museum Collections in London indicate a minimum lower mandible width of 81mm
and 65mm respectively. The lower mandible increases in width posteriorly, which could account for the
larger size of the gouges compared to the tip of the mandible. The action of gouging the seafloor would
cause the sediment to arch and create a marginal berm either side of the depression. Overtime, this berm
would slump on either side of the depression and would result in a slightly larger, less defined acoustic
shadow on the seafloor, as detected by the sidescan. The authors acknowledge that this type of data is
not ideal to calculate exact sizes (line 146), but it does give an indication of the magnitude of each gouge
to compare with existing literature.
Line 153-154: This reference only considers the hearing anatomy. It is unknown what depth beaked whales or
sperm whales can or do attain.
The authors stand by the citation. The reference refers to cephalic anatomy, which suggests that the
Cuvier’s beaked whale could withstand depths of up to 5000m.
Line 135-207: There are 70-some lines of pure speculation here which add essentially no strength to the
argument for or against an odontocete producing the grooves. The arguments here re-present and expand on
speculations in the two previous reports on the same topic. I think it would be more productive to discuss what
other type of fauna might produce the observed features and perhaps how one might go about collecting more
evidence. For example, if the grooves are scrapes, perhaps eDNA of skin fragments in the sediment might
help identify the taxa.
Since the previous reports on the same topic, there has been wealth of literature published, which has
been thoroughly reviewed in the presented manuscript. The previous publications conclude that these
gouges are caused by foraging beaked whales, specifically the Cuvier’s beaked whale (Woodside et al.,
2006) while, Auster and Watling (2010) consider multiple species. Here, we discuss a number of different
species of beaked whale and the sperm whale. We review each hypothesis in turn but do not conclude a
particular species or definitive reason as to why an individual would make such marks.
To address the reviewer’s concerns, we have removed, re-ordered and abridged the text in Lines (now)
172-213, but keep many points in the discussion as the authors believe that they are an important and
relevant review of potential evidence.
The lead author is currently seeking funding to continue this work and has proposed eDNA techniques in
parallel work that is ongoing in a different region. The authors respectively suggest that this publication
is not the place to propose a scientific protocol for further work however, lines 232-234 do suggest that a
combination of ROV and AUV techniques are required to investigate these gouges further.
Line 209: 'conclusively' is a little ambitious here.
Agreed, “conclusively” has been removed from line 220.
There are a number of incomplete references: numbers 42 and 43 are examples.
These have been corrected accordingly.
Authors response to Editors general comments:
The authors have addressed all the comments from both Reviewer 1 & 2. Supporting data can be
accessed as supplementary material – line 239-240.
Appendix B
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have attended to most of the issues that were raised in the previous review
although incompletely in some cases. I appreciate that the authors have toned down the
assertions that beaked whales must be responsible for the grooves and have abbreviated their
speculations about foraging implications (with the exception of the last few paragraphs of the
discussion). There are still some minor issues that need to be taken care of, as outlined below,
but I would recommend publication if these are resolved.
The authors would like to sincerely thank Reviewer 2 for their time and constructive
comments which, we feel, have greatly improved the manuscript. We hope that we have
addressed all of the outstanding comments and look forward to seeing this paper
accepted for publication.
Line 85: You explained these selection criteria well in your response to reviewer comments,
but the criterion for 6 sequential depressions is still unjustified in the text. I suggest you add a
brief comment explaining why this number was chosen.
The authors have added the following text to explain the objective criteria.
“As the detection of depressions varies with the quality of the sidescan data, not all
depressions were easily resolved. Therefore, objective criteria were designed to assess
the spatial patterns of the depressions within a given track. For M83 and M85, only 1
and 2 tracks were detected respectively. Both of these sets of tracks had a minimum
number of 6 depressions (i.e. 5 mid-point to mid-point distances). As a result, 6 was set
as the minimum number of sequential, detectable depressions for M79 and M80.
Additionally, the tracks were not counted if they crossed the nadir of the geophysical
survey (the centre region of the sidescan sonar swath, which represents the seafloor
directly under the sonar, and tends to be poorly resolved as a result of the geometry of
the acoustic signal). If a track crosses the nadir, a depression may not have been
detected in the region of the seafloor in which the nadir occurs, which would result in
an incorrect distance between depressions being calculated.”
Line 145: This is good but please, as I requested previously, state the inconsistencies in size
and shape. e.g., Woodside et al. (2006) describe a central groove some 10cm wide and 5-
10cm deep surrounded by a gently sloping 0.5-1.0 m wide bowl. Only the latter feature
appears to concur with observations in the current paper.
The authors have added the following to address this comment:
“However, it is important to note that some inconsistencies are observed, specifically when
compared to those from (Woodside et al., 2006), where a narrow groove central groove
is observed superimposed on a larger seafloor depression. These differences could be
attributed to either (a) the methodologies obtaining the size and morphology of depression -
sidescan sonar can be used only to provide approximate measurements based on acoustic
shadows and may not resolve subtleties in the morphology (i.e. a groove feature within a
depression), while measurements from oblique ROV videography can again only provide an
estimate of size, but will give greater visual resolution; (b) the relative age of the
depression, which may result in altered morphology, owing to seafloor processes and/or
finally; (c) different species are responsible for making the depressions.”
Line168: I reiterate my comment in the last review that the Cranford paper only refers to cranial
anatomy. Evidently there must be a whole slew of physiological factors that also constrain dive
depth. I strongly recommend changing 'Results from anatomical studies reveal that an extant
species of beaked whale could be capable of diving to depths of 5000 m' to: 'Anatomical
studies suggest that cranial air spaces in Cuvier's beaked whales could withstand a dive to
depths of 5000 m but the physiological limits of diving are unknown.'
The authors have changed the text in line with that suggested by Reviewer 2 and are
grateful for the suggestion.
Line 172: 'why whales cause' change to 'why whales may cause'
Changed as suggested.
Line 186-190: This is a bit misleading. The fish described in the cited stomach contents for
Berardius and Ziphius are much shallower living. To my knowledge, no deep-bathyal/abyssal
species have been reported.
The references cited do report that Ziphius cavirostris (West et al., 2017; Adams et al.,
2015) have been found to feed on Albatrossia pectoralis (max. depth 3500m) and
Berardius bairdii (Walker et al., 2002) were reported to feed on Laemonema longipes
(2025m), Antimora microlepis (3048m), Coryphaenoides cinereus (3500m),
Coryphaenoides acrolepis (3700m) and Albatrossia pectoralis (3500m) (depth ranges of
fish taken from fishbase.org). The authors have changed “primarily feed on” to
“reported to feed on”, which is in line with the literature.
“Some species of beaked whale are known to feed in close proximity to the seafloor
(Mesoplodon densirostris) (45), while other species (Ziphius cavirostris) in the east (46)
and west North Pacific (Berardius bairdii) (47) are reported to feed on abyssal bentho-pelagic
fish, including the Macrouridae (or grenadiers).”
Line 190-192: I am not clear why it is 'unlikely' that the 'sequential tracks are a by-product of
whale chasing prey...' Use of echolocation and suction does not avoid a chase (e.g., Aguilar de
Soto et al. Animal Ecology 2008 - pilot whales use suction and echolocation). Could this be a
typo?
The authors have altered this sentence to suggest that chasing prey is a plausible
explanation based on the reference provided by Reviewer 2.
“Although an efficient predatory method of echolocation (50) and suction feeding is
employed by beaked whales (51), and other known species of odontocetes, this does
not preclude a chase after escaping prey. Energetic foraging has been shown in the
echolocating, suction-feeding, short-finned pilot whale (52), therefore it is plausible that
sequential tracks could be a by-product of whale chasing prey (10).”
Line 199-201:
There appear to be no comment with reference to this line from Reviewer 2.
Line 206: In the paper cited (Martin Lopez et al. 2016) only one of the three beaked whale
species analysed appears to be close to neutrally bouyant at depth (this was Cuvier's). All
three species use the unique stroke and glide pattern so this does not appear to be closely
connected with buoyancy.
The authors have changed text to the following:
“…glide pattern that suggest a neutral buoyancy for some species at depth (59)”
Line 206-208: '...evolutionarily designed to forage optimally at depth' This will raise the hackles
of many biologists. Evolution neither designs nor optimises. You are also conflating a range of
very different niches in the theme of deep foraging: capability to forage efficiently in the
mesopelagic does not imply similar efficiency in the bathy- or deep bentho-pelagic.
The authors have changed text to the following:
“These adaptations would suggest that deep-diving species have the capability to forage
at depth without the need ingest large quantities of sediment to add ballast.”
Line 208: That I know of, sediment and rocks have not been reported in stomach contents of
Cuvier's beaked whales and other smaller beaked whale species. In fairness, this should be
mentioned alongside the interesting Baird's beaked whale observation.
There authors have only considered references here were there are reports of the
species foraging at depth and containing gastroliths. There are reports of other smaller
odontocetes ingesting stones (“…stones and mud indicate that H. ampullatus must
sometimes feed on the ocean floor” (Benjaminsen and Christensen, 1979, p.154 cited in
Clarke, 2005) but these are at shallower depths.)
Also, it is not clear from the literature whether no mention of stones means that these
objects were not present, or simply not reported (with the exception of Adams et al. who
explicitly state that no stones were reported in the stomach of a Cuvier beaked whale).
The authors do not feel that it is appropriate to cite the literature where stomach stones
have not been reported.
This section is also more relevant to the sperm whale, for which there is important
literature that needs to be reviewed and discussed.
Lines 194-213: 20 lines on geophagy is definitely more than the data and literature on this
topic deserve. I recommend you combine this material into a single short paragraph. Most of
the commentary on bouyancy and biomechanical strategies in swimming is non-conclusive
and highly speculative. A diet including benthic organisms seems sufficient to account for the
gravel reported by Walker et al. 2002, as they themselves conclude.
Text from these paragraphs have been abridged, combined and corrected in line with
suggestions from the reviewer above (lines 199-208), into a single, more concise
paragraph.
Line 216-218: What physiological evidence? You have only cited a paper that says that the
head shouldn't cave in! Also there are only 5 beaked whale species in the CCZ according to
your line 155. The implications for management remain the same whatever megafauna is
responsible so this sentence should be broadened and the assertion about capabilities should
be dropped.
The authors have altered the paragraph to address the reviewers concerns.
“Sperm whales and all the extant species of Ziphiidae are likely to occur within the CCZ and
research would suggest that some of these deep-divers may be capable of utilising the
seafloor within this region”
Line 230-237: This paragraph is taking as proven that whales are responsible for the gouges,
abandoning the more measured tone that the rest of the paper mostly now adopts. Given that
you cannot conclude what animal is producing the gouges, it is hard to argue that AUVs and
ROVs will be key new technologies for studying cetacean behaviour. These tools will certainly
be useful for assessing the extent of these sea-floor interactions, whatever the taxa involved,
and therefore will help understand the potential impacts of deep sea mining on deep-sea
trophic webs. I suggest you adapt this paragraph accordingly.
The authors have altered the paragraph to address the reviewers concerns.
“Whichever taxa maybe responsible for these seafloor interactions, this study highlights
how the use of ultra-low altitude deep-submergence AUV’s will become invaluable in detecting
these observations over large scales (kilometers) and deriving seafloor habitat utilization
maps, while human-directed ROV observations will be key in visually examining and sampling
these disturbances further. Deep-diving whales can be found throughout our global oceans - to
what extent they are utilizing and altering the seafloor environment remains unknown. The
observations presented in this study highlight the number of important discoveries yet to be
made about our ocean and yet, we are already looking to exploit a habitat that we know very
little about.
