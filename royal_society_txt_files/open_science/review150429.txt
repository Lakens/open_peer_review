This study by Smolina et al. aims to evaluate how varied the thermal stress response of two
populations of Fucus distichus is to equal stress levels. It focuses on population responses and
provides data on an ecosystem engineer species with strong ecological relevance.
I believe this study could be suited for publication in Royal Society Open Science. Yet, I have
some doubts about the experimental design used and I think the writing style could be improved
to better clarify the points being made. Therefore, I recommend revision before publication of this
manuscript.
The introduction is well structured and revises the literature, while introducing one of the
response variables, the heat shock proteins. I think a small section about the other response
variables, photosynthetic parameters, would be appropriate and would enhance the quality of the
introduction.
The structure of the material and methods sections is generally good. In the description of the
experimental design I think clarification is needed to allow the reader to understand if the 3
temperatures were used simultaneously or on separate dates/runs of the experiment.
Clarification of the terms “acclimation conditions (control)” and “acclimation conditions
(treatments)” by providing the temperature they refer to would also improve clarity. Focusing on
the statistical analyses I would prefer that homogenous variance of data was assessed with a
statistical test, as for example a Cochran's test instead of visual assessment. It would also be
interesting to be able to compare 15min thermal stress responses with 60 min thermal stress
responses when doing the Dunnett’s multiple pairwise comparisons to determine if the length of
the stress changes the response of the algae.
The results section is well structured and results are related to the figures and tables provided.
However I believe some aspects could be improved. For example the phrase “Line 8 page
4…Despite the low population effect...Fv/Fm measure (figure 2a,b)” needs rewriting to clarify
the point being made. The legend of figure 2 and 3 could also better clarify which differences are
being assessed by the significant symbols.
The structure and content of the discussion section is fine. Generally, the discussion puts the
work into a more global perspective by comparing this work with others focused on other marine
organisms and by providing possible explanations for the interpretation of the results obtained. A
small improvement would be to provide some references that support the first phrase. The fact
that the authors acknowledge that the range of temperatures tested is well outside the range
encountered across the distributional range of the species and then explain why they think the
study is still relevant is very important and in my view should be introduced earlier in the
discussion section.
Take into account my previous comment I believe that if improvements are made the study could
be suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
Major Comments:
1. Temperature treatment. The temperatures of 20, 24 and 28C were designated for heat
shocks. Did these temperatures commonly occur in the natural habitats of Fucus distichus? If no,
why these temperatures were selected?
2. The discussion is not enough, especially about the relationship between photosynthesis
and heat shock response. Both photosynthesis and heat shock responses were measured in the
present study, however, authors discussed their changes almost separately. Actually there are
close relationships between them via energy production and consumption. So I suggest authors
should discuss more here.
Minor comments:
1. Page 1, line 43, “while they have a relatively low ability to adjust their physiology”. Is it
true? In my mind, some intertidal species do have high capability for thermal regulation.
2. Page 1 line 51-53 “In addition, organisms from highly variable environments seem to be
more adapted to high temperature than their congeners living under moderate thermal variation
[11]”. I wonder whether this description is true or not because some tropical and subtropical
population (moderate thermal variation) do have higher thermal tolerance than the temperate
populations (highly variable environment).
3. Page 4 line 33-34 “1). Overall, expression levels for all genes were higher in the Svalbard
population than in the Kirkenes population (figure 3).” This description is different from what in
the first paragraph in this Part (line 27-31)
4. References. There are many references about the latitudinal variations of hsp70
expression for intertidal species, for example, Lima et al, 2015, Global change biology, Dong et al.,
2015. MEPS.
5. Figures: the symbols are not clear enough for representing the statistical differences.

I believe the authors have generally made good improvements taking into account the comments
previously made.
The only point I still don’t fully understand refers to the sentence on page 4, line 13. The authors
mention that the only significant effect of population was found at 24C and no significant
interaction between population and treatment was found, therefore I believe the content of the
phrase on page 4, line 13 is not supported by the statistical analyses.

Appendix A
Dear Editor,
Please consider a revised version of the manuscript “Variation in thermal stress
response in two populations of the brown seaweed, Fucus distichus, from the Arctic
and subarctic intertidal” by Smolina et al. (RSOS-150429) for resubmission for Royal
Society Open Science.
We thank the two reviewers for their constructive comments and corrections that
helped improve the manuscript. We have revised the manuscript accordingly with
the biggest changes being: 1) better and earlier justification of the selected
temperatures for the thermal stresses; 2) earlier introduction of photosynthetic
performance measures and discussion on relationship between photosynthesis and
heat shock proteins; and 3) clarification of figure legends.
Our point-by-point responses to all the comments are listed below.
We hope that with applied changes the revised manuscript could be considered for
publication.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Major Comments:
1.1. Temperature treatment. The temperatures of 20, 24 and 28C were
designated for heat shocks. Did these temperatures commonly occur in the natural
habitats of Fucus distichus? If no, why these temperatures were selected?
>>> It is correct that the temperatures selected for the thermal stress do not
occur throughout the distributional range of F. distichus, as stated in Figure 1
and the discussion. In accordance with the comments of reviewer 1 and
reviewer 2 (comment 2.9) we discuss reasoning for the use of these
temperatures at the end of the introduction (p. 2).
1.2. The discussion is not enough, especially about the relationship between
photosynthesis and heat shock response. Both photosynthesis and heat shock
responses were measured in the present study, however, authors discussed their
changes almost separately. Actually there are close relationships between them via
energy production and consumption. So I suggest authors should discuss more
here.
>>> We followed the reviewer´s recommendation and extended the discussion
into this topic (p. 4).
Minor comments:
1.3. Page 1, line 43, “while they have a relatively low ability to adjust their
physiology”. Is it true? In my mind, some intertidal species do have high capability
for thermal regulation.
>>> We agree with the reviewer that some intertidal species have high
capability for thermal regulation within the highly variable intertidal
environment. However our point is that some intertidal species live close to
their upper tolerance limits and have low ability to respond to further increases
of an environmental factor, for instance temperature. We clarify this point and
include more references (p. 1).
1.4. Page 1 line 51-53 “In addition, organisms from highly variable environments
seem to be more adapted to high temperature than their congeners living under
moderate thermal variation [11]”. I wonder whether this description is true or not
because some tropical and subtropical population (moderate thermal variation) do
have higher thermal tolerance than the temperate populations (highly variable
environment).
>>> The questioned sentence is supported by the reference 12 (previously
11). However, we acknowledge that described by the reviewer example also
could be true. Therefore, we have revised it to “organisms from highly variable
environments generally differ in their thermal tolerance (including heat shock
response (HSR)) from congeners in more moderate and stable thermal
environments” (p. 1).
1.5. Page 4 line 33-34 “1). Overall, expression levels for all genes were higher in
the Svalbard population than in the Kirkenes population (figure 3).” This description
is different from what in the first paragraph in this Part (line 27-31)
>>> We agree with the comment, and clarify that the sentence on lines 33-34
describes expression level after the thermal stress, while the sentence on
lines 27-31 is about expression under control conditions (p. 4).
1.6. References. There are many references about the latitudinal variations of
hsp70 expression for intertidal species, for example, Lima et al, 2015, Global
change biology, Dong et al., 2015. MEPS.
>>> We follow the reviewer´s suggestion and include these references (p. 4,
references number 49 and 50)
1.7. Figures: the symbols are not clear enough for representing the statistical
differences.
>>> We follow the recommendation of both reviewers (comment 2.7 of the
second reviewer as well) and improved the legend to the figures 2 and 3 to
clarify which differences were being assessed by the significant symbols (p.
7).

Comments to the Author(s)
This study by Smolina et al. aims to evaluate how varied the thermal stress
response of two populations of Fucus distichus is to equal stress levels. It focuses
on population responses and provides data on an ecosystem engineer species with
strong ecological relevance.
I believe this study could be suited for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Yet, I have some doubts about the experimental design used and I think the writing
style could be improved to better clarify the points being made. Therefore, I
recommend revision before publication of this manuscript.
2.1. The introduction is well structured and revises the literature, while introducing
one of the response variables, the heat shock proteins. I think a small section about
the other response variables, photosynthetic parameters, would be appropriate and
would enhance the quality of the introduction.
>>> We follow the recommendation of the reviewer (p. 2).
2.2. The structure of the material and methods sections is generally good. In the
description of the experimental design I think clarification is needed to allow the
reader to understand if the 3 temperatures were used simultaneously or on separate
dates/runs of the experiment.
>>> We follow the reviewer´s recommendation and clarify that the
experiments were run separately (p. 2).
2.3. Clarification of the terms “acclimation conditions (control)” and “acclimation
conditions (treatments)” by providing the temperature they refer to would also
improve clarity.
>>> We follow the reviewer´s recommendation and have tried to clarify the
sentence and mentioned required temperatures (p. 3).
2.4. Focusing on the statistical analyses I would prefer that homogenous variance of
data was assessed with a statistical test, as for example a Cochran's test instead of
visual assessment.
>>> We followed the suggestion of the reviewer and performed a Cochran´s C
test (p. 3). Nevertheless it did not influence significantly on the choice of
further statistical tests.
2.5. It would also be interesting to be able to compare 15min thermal stress
responses with 60 min thermal stress responses when doing the Dunnett’s multiple
pairwise comparisons to determine if the length of the stress changes the response
of the algae.
>>> We agree with the reviewer that comparisons between treatments could
be also interesting (however it cannot remain a Dunnett’s multiple pairwise
comparison since it´s a test to compare several treatments with a single
control). Nevertheless, investigation of effect of thermal stress duration was
not an ultimate goal of this study, and we feel that it will reduce the power of
tests due to increase of number of multiple comparisons (6 versus current 3)
and will rather complicated understanding of results due to too many different
comparisons.
2.6. The results section is well structured and results are related to the figures and
tables provided. However I believe some aspects could be improved. For example
the phrase “Line 8 page 4…Despite the low population effect...Fv/Fm measure
(figure 2a,b)” needs rewriting to clarify the point being made.
>>> We follow the recommendation (p. 4).
2.7. The legend of figure 2 and 3 could also better clarify which differences are
being assessed by the significant symbols.
>>> We agree with the reviewer and clarified accordingly (p. 7).
2.8. The structure and content of the discussion section is fine. Generally, the
discussion puts the work into a more global perspective by comparing this work with
others focused on other marine organisms and by providing possible explanations
for the interpretation of the results obtained. A small improvement would be to
provide some references that support the first phrase.
>>> We follow the reviewer´s recommendation (p. 4).
2.9. The fact that the authors acknowledge that the range of temperatures tested is
well outside the range encountered across the distributional range of the species
and then explain why they think the study is still relevant is very important and in my
view should be introduced earlier in the discussion section.
>>> We follow the recommendation of the reviewer 2 (and reviewer 1,
comment 1.1.) and shifted this part to the end of the introduction (p. 2).

Dear Editor,
Please consider a revised version of the manuscript “Variation in thermal stress
response in two populations of the brown seaweed, Fucus distichus, from the Arctic

We have revised the manuscript accordingly with the only comment from Reviewer
2. We rewrote the questioned sentence to clarify that observed population-specific
responses obtained not from direct two-factorial statistical comparison but are a
trend appeared from an individual analysis of each population illustrated on the
figure 2.

Comments to the Author(s)
I believe the authors have generally made good improvements taking into account
the comments previously made.
The only point I still don’t fully understand refers to the sentence on page 4, line 13.
The authors mention that the only significant effect of population was found at 24C
and no significant interaction between population and treatment was found,
therefore I believe the content of the phrase on page 4, line 13 is not supported by
the statistical analyses.
>>> We agree with the reviewer that this sentence is not fully supported by the
two-factorial statistical analysis. However we aimed to point an interesting
trend appeared from an individual analysis of each population illustrated on
the figure 2. Nevertheless, to avoid reference to the direct statistical
comparison of population responses we rewrote the sentence:
“Nevertheless, photosynthetic response of the Kirkenes population was
affected at lower stress temperatures (24°C for Fv/Fm, figure 2b; 20°C for PIABS,
figure 2d) than of the Svalbard population (28°C for Fv/Fm, figure 2a; 24°C for
PIABS, figure 2c).”
