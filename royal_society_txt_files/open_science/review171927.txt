Comments to the authors:
The submitted manuscript reported the designed mesoporous materials by using diatomite as a
silica source. The author pointed that the constructing organic-inorganic hybrid frameworks with
polymer materials improves the properties of mesoporous materials. The author also concluded
that the novel functional nanocomposite material (CMP) with large specific surface area and
multifunctional groups was prepared and exhibits high removal rate and adsorption capacity.
The author investigated the adsorption mechanism of the adsorption process. The results are
quite clear and straight forward; the following comments need to be addressed/changed before
accepted by the journal.
1. The author mentioned” Figure 3a demonstrates an interconnection of the nearly spherical
particles with size in the range of 50-100 nm for MCM-41-PAA. As could be clearly seen in Figure
3b, the white striped chitosan was homogeneously dispersed with the mesoporous…..”,
However, the reviewer can hardly see “clearly” for any information from figure 3 (SEM images).
Since the size are aroung 50-100 nm, it is a better to do a TEM other than just low magnification

SEM. The reviewer suggest the author do a high magnification SEM along with the low mag
images or a TEM instead to present the morphology of the particles. Please refer the article
Journal of Imaging Science and Technology 54 (2), 20501-1-20501-7 to see how to do a clear SEM
on the particles range from 50-100nm.

animal ethics committee before conducting your research. Please provide details of these licences
and approvals in an Animal Ethics section after your main text.
*OR*
Please clarify whether you obtained the appropriate permissions and licences to conduct the
fieldwork detailed in your study. Please provide details of these in your methods section.
• Acknowledgements
Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship
criteria.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days (i.e. by the 18-Feb-2018). If you do not think

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-171927)
Dear Reviewers:
Thank you for your comments concerning our manuscript entitled “Preparation of
Chitosan/MCM-41-PAA Nanocomposites and its Adsorption Behaviour of Hg(II) ions” (RSOS-
171927). Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our paper,
as well as the important guiding significance to our researches. We have studied comments
carefully and have made correction which we hope meet with approval. Revised portion are
marked in red in the paper. The main corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s
comments are as flowing:
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer #1:
Thank you for your recognition of our work.
Reviewer #2:
Q1. The author mentioned” Figure 3a demonstrates an interconnection of the nearly spherical
particles with size in the range of 50-100 nm for MCM-41-PAA. As could be clearly seen in Figure
3b, the white striped chitosan was homogeneously dispersed with the mesoporous…..”,
However, the reviewer can hardly see “clearly” for any information from figure 3 (SEM images).
Since the size are aroung 50-100 nm, it is a better to do a TEM other than just low magnification
SEM. The reviewer suggest the author do a high magnification SEM along with the low mag
images or a TEM instead to present the morphology of the particles. Please refer the article
Journal of Imaging Science and Technology 54 (2), 20501-1-20501-7 to see how to do a clear SEM
on the particles range from 50-100 nm.
Response: According to your comments “the reviewer can hardly see “clearly” for any
information from figure 3 (SEM images)”, little information can be obtained on the
microstructure of materials only from the Figure 3, however, combined with Table 1, detailed
investigation on the microstructure of CMP are presented.
In addition, we supplement Figure S1 and Figure S2 about pore size distribution of MCM-41-
PAA and CMP, please refer to page 12 of the manuscript and supporting information for details.
These results will demonstrate clearly the morphology, specific surface area, the pore size and
distribution of MCM-41-PAA and CMP.
