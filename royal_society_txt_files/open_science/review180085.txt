This manuscript demonstrated the rapid degradation of malachite green (MG) by an MW
induced enhanced catalytic process with CoFe2O4"SiC foam. The catalyst was synthesized from
CoFe2O4 particles and SiC foam. The plan of the work is interesting but before the acceptance,
following changes must be performed.
1. English language of the manuscript needs to be more professional.
2. There is no need to give the structure of MG because it is very common dye.
There are too many figures. Either transfer some figures in the supplementary part or merge the
figures and improve the quality of all figures.
3. There are several a method for the removal of dyes in which adsorption is also applied for the
removal of dyes from aqueous medium. How the present method is better than the adsorption.
Did the authors check the adsorption also? It should be discussed in the introduction and the
present result should be compared/supported by the following references of adsorption work:

Comment to manuscript (ID: RSOS-180085)
In this manuscript, the authors describe the synthesis of SiC-CoFe2O4 by hydrothermal method.
This could solve the separation of catalyst after reactions, but also greatly enhance the MW-
absorbance. Moreover, the authors attempted to degradate and discolorate aqueous solution
containing MG dyes and explored the degradation and catalytic mechanism.
The reviewer suggested major revision for this manuscript.
There are some questions listed below:
1. In the abstract section, there is lack of logicality. The authors need to modify this section,
completely.
1. In P2, Line 23: the solution pH has been changed to 8.5, and MW irradiation achieved 95.01%
removal of MG. The authors need to show the removal content of MG when solution pH was
adjusted to 8.5 or other pH, because MG was sensitive to solution pH. Without the presence of
catalyst and/or MW, MG could be effectively discolorated and degraded by alkaline pH. Similar
questions were also observed in this manuscript.
2. P5, Line 82-85: as described in the introduction section, the authors should compare the
degradation content of MG over SiC-CoFe2O4 with that over C-CoFe2O4. Otherwise, the readers
fail to know the exact degradation advantages of SiC-CoFe2O4. What’s the main difference
between SiC-CoFe2O4 with that over C-CoFe2O4? which kind of catalyst is superior? Thus, the
introduction section should be rewritten to outline the exact scientific questions in this
manuscript.
3. This manuscript has not cited some important references:
4. The main degradation intermediates of MG could be clearly verified by the above references.
This will be benefit for the comparison and identification of degradation products. Moreover, in
aqueous solution, the MW hot-spot effect is still questioned. Thus, the sufficient proof for the
generation of hot-spots is one of the key points. What about the temperature for the effluent and
catalyst layer? These questions could be referred to some important references:

132; [3] Journal of Hazardous Materials 263 (2013) 600-609; [4] Separation and Purification
Technology 170 (2016) 57-67.
5. In Fig. 11, the reviewer questioned the explanation for MG degradation products and
mechanism. The authors should further check the results by LC-MS.

Appendix A
Response to Reviewer: 1
Comments:
This manuscript demonstrated the rapid degradation of malachite green (MG) by an MW induced
enhanced catalytic process with CoFe2O4"SiC foam. The catalyst was synthesized from CoFe2O4
particles and SiC foam. The plan of the work is interesting but before the acceptance, following
changes must be performed.
Comment: 1. English language of the manuscript needs to be more professional.
Response: Thank you very much. There are some issues about English language in this article, after
careful modification, the language has been improved.
2. There is no need to give the structure of MG because it is very common dye.There are too many
figures. Either transfer some figures in the supplementary part or merge the figures and improve the
quality of all figures.
Response: Thank you very much. The structure of the MG has been deleted and we put some figures
nto supplementary part.
3. There are several a method for the removal of dyes in which adsorption is also applied for the
removal of dyes from aqueous medium. How the present method is better than the adsorption. Did
the authors check the adsorption also? It should be discussed in the introduction and the present
result should be compared/supported by the following references of adsorption work:
Journal of Cleaner Production 152, 443-453, 2017; Process Safety and Environmental Protection 109,
301-310, 2017; Desalination and water treatment 84, 262-270, 2017; Journal of Chemical &
Engineering Data 61 (11), 3806-3813, 2016, Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A:
Chemistry 329, 61-68, 2016; Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry 20 (5), 3890-3900,
2014.
Response: Thank you very much. Absorption is a conventional method to remove the organics from
aqueous medium. During the process of adsorption, the organics just transferred from liquid phase
to solid phase, the structure of organics itself has not changed. However, the organics in aqueous
medium degraded into small molecules when treated by microwave and catalyst. Therefore the
mechanism of this two methods are different. In this article, we added the introduction of
adsorption method into introduction section. At the same time, we compared the adsorption
efficiency and the degradation rate of this article. This two articles below were quoted: Process
Safety and Environmental Protection 109, 301-310, 2017; Journal of Industrial and Engineering
Chemistry 20 (5), 3890-3900, 2014.
4. The result and discussion part should be improved with proper references.
Response: Thank you very much. We noticed that the result and discussion part was not substantial.
We have added some references and improved this part.
5. Include some more characterization like BET and XPS.
Response: Thank you very much. Because SiC foam was a whole block, the BET test would break it
and make the test meaningless. At the same time, we added the XPS into the article.
6. Did the authors check any other solvent for the recyclability of the material?
Response: No, we did not use any solvent for the recyclability of the catalyst, but we think it was a
good point bout enhanced the stability of the catalyst. We are looking forward take into account of
this part in future studies.
Response to Reviewer 2
Comment:In this manuscript, the authors describe the synthesis of SiC-CoFe2O4 by hydrothermal
method. This could solve the separation of catalyst after reactions, but also greatly enhance the
MW-absorbance. Moreover, the authors attempted to degradate and discolorate aqueous solution
containing MG dyes and explored the degradation and catalytic mechanism.
The reviewer suggested major revision for this manuscript.
There are some questions listed below:
1.In the abstract section, there is lack of logicality. The authors need to modify this section,
completely.
Response: Thank you very much. This part has been modified very well, the structure between
sentences has been adjusted to make the whole logical structure better.
2.In P2, Line 23: the solution pH has been changed to 8.5, and MW irradiation achieved 95.01%
removal of MG. The authors need to show the removal content of MG when solution pH was
adjusted to 8.5 or other pH, because MG was sensitive to solution pH. Without the presence of
catalyst and/or MW, MG could be effectively discolorated and degraded by alkaline pH. Similar
questions were also observed in this manuscript.
Response: Thank you very much. In the whole experiment, the pH of the MG kept the same from
reaction to the detection, and during the detection, different pH curves were made to determine
different pH of MG aqueous solution.
3.P5, Line 82-85: as described in the introduction section, the authors should compare the
degradation content of MG over SiC-CoFe2O4 with that over C-CoFe2O4. Otherwise, the readers fail
to know the exact degradation advantages of SiC-CoFe2O4. What’s the main difference between SiC-
CoFe2O4 with that over C-CoFe2O4? which kind of catalyst is superior? Thus, the introduction
section should be rewritten to outline the exact scientific questions in this manuscript.
Response: Thank you very much. In the introduction part, we added (RSC Adv., 2016, 6, 93564) to
show the difference of Coal fly ash/CoFe2O4 and SiC-CoFe2O4 foam, the discussion was in the page
23, line 367-371.
4.This manuscript has not cited some important references:
Response: Thank you very much. The article added the references :
[1]Chemical Engineering Journal. 173, 737-742. [2] Chemosphere. 38, 2667-2680.
[3]Journal of Hazardous Materials. 173, 393-400.
5.The main degradation intermediates of MG could be clearly verified by the above references. This
will be benefit for the comparison and identification of degradation products. Moreover, in aqueous
solution, the MW hot-spot effect is still questioned. Thus, the sufficient proof for the generation of
hot-spots is one of the key points. What about the temperature for the effluent and catalyst layer?
These questions could be referred to some important references:
[1] J. Phys. Chem. A 2008, 112, 11172-11177; [2] Journal of Hazardous Materials 171 (2009) 123-132;
[3] Journal of Hazardous Materials 263 (2013) 600-609; [4] Separation and Purification Technology
170 (2016) 57-67.
Response: Thank you very much. In the experiment, the water ran through the reactor, because the
temperature of catalyst was very high and the water evaporated. The temperature was hard to
measure. But we are trying to put temperature sensor into the reactor. In fact, the hotspot was
simulated by simulation method.
6.In Fig. 11, the reviewer questioned the explanation for MG degradation products and mechanism.
The authors should further check the results by LC-MS.
Response: Thank you very much. The results of LC-MS were double checked, the products were the
same.
Response to late reviewer:
This study reported a waste water treatment using microwave catalytic method to degrade
malachite green. SiC foam was used as catalyst support and microwave absorber, and CoFe2O4 was
loaded at SiC to act as catalytic site. Degradation rate as 95.01% was achieved and the system can
continuously and high-efficiently run. However, there are still some issues should be improved.
1. First of all, the effect of microwave on degradation was not clear. Did microwave only provide
thermal effect? If so, are there any difference between microwave and conventional heating
methods? If there are some special effect brought by microwave, can you elaborate this by some
comparative experiments? Besides, temperature monitor of the reaction zone is necessary, please
give the corresponding temperature data in each power set.
Response: Thank you very much. The microwave was not just provide thermal, in the article, the
microwave generated •OH which oxidized MG. The temperature in the reactor was difficult to
detect, but according to the quoted document (Chemical Engineering Journal. 173, 737-742), the
temperature could be 1000<U+2103> or more.
2. Another concern is the metal loading process. The measurement of loading amount which applied
in MS was not accurate, and an ICP-MS analysis was recommended. What’s more, it is difficult to
precisely control the loading content, so it may lead to some deviation in afterwards analysis.
Response: Thank you very much. The loading process wasn’t very accurate, but we tried to different
concentration of the solution and found the connection of the load mass. In the future study, we can
use ICP-MS analysis to analyse the catalyst.
3. The production analysis should be strengthen and more detailed investigation on reaction
pathways should be conducted. If the MG only cracked into smaller contaminant which still exist in
water, that would make no sense.
Response: Thank you very much. The results of LC-MS were double checked, the products were the
same.
Other minor comments:
4. There are two sets of line number in manuscript.
Response: Thank you very much. The problem was solved.
5. The figures should be arranged in order. First-quoted figure should also listed firstly. (Fig.3 should
corrected as Fig.1).
Response: Thank you very much. The problem was solved.
6. Line 108, Page 6, there are no characteristics introduced in section 2.2. So the title of this section
should be revised to Preparation of Catalysts.
Response: Thank you very much. The title was changed.
7. Why there are blank spaces in some paragraph, but others are not?
Response: Thank you very much. The problem was solved.
8. As depicted in Fig.6, with the increase of microwave power, the degradation rate increased. Then
why did you choose 720 W as the optimal power?
Response: Thank you very much. The power was wrong before and it was corrected.
9. Line 297 to 299, Page 19. You said “high temperature caused the water to vaporize, leaving MG on
the catalyst surface to degraded by CoFe2O4 particles”, however, you didn’t give the temperature of
hot spots as well as the boiling point of MG.
Response: Thank you very much. The reaction on the surface of catalyst was very fast, the boiling
point of MG was 526.2<U+2103>, and MG vaporized on the surface of catalyst.
10. Line 310, Page 19, “OH still may still be generated …” should be re-wrote.
Response: Thank you very much. The problem was solved.
11. Fig. 10, there is a red underline beneath “SiC”. Please delete.
Response: Thank you very much. The problem was solved.
12. Line 360, Page 24. You mentioned “degradation rate reached 95.1%”, it is different from what
you listed in abstract. (Line 23, Page 2, “achieving 95.01% degradation within 5 min …”)
Response: Thank you very much. This section has been re-wrote.
