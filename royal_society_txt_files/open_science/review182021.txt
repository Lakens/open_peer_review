This is an interesting paper which explores how a medial-lateral oscillating load may affect the
energetics and biomechanics of human walking. I suggest addressing the following discussion
points prior to publication:
Minor Revisions/Discussion Points:
• Why was a 67:1 gear ratio chosen? What makes this gear ratio ideal for the Maxxon motor to
generate electricity at max efficiency?
• Would more power have been generated if the gear backlash issue could be solved? Would
spring-loaded anti-backlash gears help prevent the backlash issue, or would some other method
be useful? Could the effective damping due to gear backlash have affected any other results
beside power generation?
• On line 284-285, it is stated that the “… carried weight to oscillate in the M-L direction can
reduce peak forces on the user by an average 27.4%, generate electricity, …” This statement is
slightly misleading as the vertical peak forces were not affected and are ~10x larger in magnitude
that the M-L forces. It should be noted here that the peak M-L forces were reduced by an average
of 27.4%, not the peak forces on the user generally.
• Prior work with suspended load backpacks suggests that the ideal configuration may be when
the load is completely out-of-phase with the body. The phase angle of the load in this paper was
130 +/- 20.8 degrees which decreased with higher damping. Would approaching a 180 degree
phase shift be ideal for maximum energy harvesting, or is some damping necessary for this
design? Why was R2 predicted to be the ideal damping ratio for maximum energy harvesting?
• Though it’s impressive that power can be generated from M-L oscillation of a backpack without
significant effects on the energetics and biomechanics of walking, can you put this power
generation in context? The electricity generation was only 0.22 +/- 0.3 W. A smartphone charges
at 5V and ~1-2 amps, so about 10-20 W. This device would be able to trickle-charge a smartphone
in remote areas. Is this technology worthwhile considering the added backpack weight and cost,
especially considering other comparable methods of converting mechanical work into electricity
(i.e. hand crank, footpedal, etc.)? Could more energy be harvested with modifications to your
system? What is the theoretical maximum energy that could be harvested with a M-L oscillating
load? Also, human walking requires roughly 30-75 W of mechanical power, so it would make
sense that harvesting 0.22 W at a reasonable efficiency may not significantly affect the mechanical
or metabolic cost of walking. It would be helpful to put the power output in context.

Appendix A
Title: Generating electricity while walking with a medial-lateral oscillating load carriage device.
The purpose of this study was to design and test a biomechanical energy harvesting backpack that
utilizes movement in the medial-lateral direction. In this study the interaction between the
electromagnetic damping on a medial-lateral oscillating load carriage, walking kinematics, and
kinetic and electrical power generation are investigated.
This paper is well written and the experiments seems to be well conceived and performed.
I have few comments that I think would improve the paper and its impact.
<U+F0B7> Main issues:
1. Metabolic rate was calculated over only the last 2 min.
Our experience and that of others has shown that because of the variability in
these measurements 2 min are not sufficient (3-4 min are preferable). Can the
authors start use the data from earlier time? Typically, in our experiments
subjects reach steady-state state after 1.5 min, and we start after 3min, which is
most common in the literature.)
2. In the conclusions, the authors talk about the effect of the additional mass but do
not quantify it. I think it is important to do so.
Can the authors calculate what is the required mass of the device to become
worth using? As a criterion they could use the change in metabolic rate due to
addition of the device mass and compared it to the metabolic rate saved using the
device vs carrying it as a fix load.
Options for equations that calculate change in metabolic rate as a function of the add
mass and walking speed

3. Discussion
In the paper, four components describe the interaction of the device with the human
(the system frequency, the phase shift, the m-l force, and the frontal plane moment).
Yet, the discussion fails to provide insight into the role of each of these components
and the interaction between them. There are no references to papers that might help in
providing such an insight. Furthermore, even if such papers are not available, I think
you could do it graphically or by using statistical modeling (e.g., linear mixed models
with these factors explaining the change in metabolic rate)
<U+F0B7> Specific Comments
The link for your data and code did not work. So perhaps some of the comments I have made
are, in fact, addressed in these files.
Line 88-103
The masses of the parts and the total mass should be in table in the paper or in the supplementary
information.
Line 89
It is hard to understand form this figure how this device works; perhaps the authors can add a side
view. Conceptually the figure should look something like this:
mass mass
Axis of rotation Axis motion
Line 105
Again, the link for your data and code did not work. So perhaps this information is there but if
not, it would be a good idea to give the data and performance of each of the subjects.
Line 124
The out of phase analysis is worth a figure (if not in the main paper then at least in the
supplementary information.
Line 127
How did the authors apply an equivalent damping ratio of 0.7?
Line 132-133
How does the damping ratio translate to the system frequency? Like this:?
<U+0001D44A><U+0001D451> = v1 - <U+0001D70D> 2
(if so, I recommend putting in the equation).
Also, did the stepping frequency change in the different conditions?
There seems to be a difference in the reported sampling frequency (200 vs 100) of the motion
data in two places is it the same data?
Line 142, 182
Line 142
“200 Hz and filtered using a 2nd order low-pass zero-phase Butterworth”
Line 182
100Hz , also here you don’t report the cut off frequency?
Line 150-152
Again, it is difficult to understand from the text what the authors are comparing. Are both
motions are linear or angular?
Line 156 -163
It will be good if the authors could add to figure 1 the force sensor location and how they
mounted the sensor to measure both the force and moments.
Line 191-192
Should be joint kinematics were calculated using XXX [e.g. bottom-up approach (Winter
2009) ), and segment mass center and moment of inertia where calculated using [25]
Line 214
Why do the authors think that R2 condition would be the best? I think they should let the
readers know.
Line 244-55
Was there difference between the different harvesting conditions?
Line 258
In the figure you write Abd/add in the text you use frontal plane, I know you mean the same.
Yet for clarity you might want to write something like Abd/add (frontal plane) or use the
same wording in both places.
Line 338-340
Not clear how the peak power was affected by the backlash.
Line 370-373
How did the step width change with the different harvesting conditions and how is this related
(if at all) to the frontal torque?

believe we have addressed the comments brought up by the reviewer, and by doing so,
e strengthened the quality of the manuscript.
ponse to the reviewer comments (in order of appearance):
ments to the Author(s):
is an interesting paper which explores how a medial-lateral oscillating load may affect the
rgetics and biomechanics of human walking. I suggest addressing the following discussion
nts prior to publication:
or Revisions/Discussion Points:
y was a 67:1 gear ratio chosen? What makes this gear ratio ideal for the Maxxon motor to
erate electricity at max efficiency?
- From modelling done on the device, we found that a higher gear ratio results in a higher
electrical efficiency. With higher input angular velocity to the generator, the external
load resistance can be increased while still delivering the same electromotive torque on
the pendulum. This means there is less line current, resulting in a decrease in losses due
to the generator’s armature resistance. We chose gears, from what was commercially
available, that maximized our overall gear ratio while still meeting size and strength
constraints. We are also writing a paper on the design, model, and model performance
of the device in another paper. To keep the discussion mostly on the effects of the user in
this paper, and limit the amount of discussion on the device model, we added a more
concise explanation on lines 100-104. It now reads: “An overall gear ratio of 67:1 was
chosen to maximize the gear ratio, given the largest commercially available polyacetal
gears that also met our space and strength requirements (Misumi USA, IL). A greater
gear ratio was determined from modelling to minimize losses due to rotor winding
resistance.”
uld more power have been generated if the gear backlash issue could be solved? Would
ng-loaded anti-backlash gears help prevent the backlash issue, or would some other
hod be useful? Could the effective damping due to gear backlash have affected any other
lts beside power generation?
- To address your first two comments, we have added the following lines to the Discussion
Section: “Future modifications, such as higher precision gears and assembly, scissor
gears, or using mechanical rectification with one-way clutching and two drive trains
could reduce backlash within the system. However, reducing backlash may not increase
the maximum electrical power production. This is because modelling has shown that
electrical power production decreases with increased damping past the optimal damped
condition. Therefore, given a system with no mechanical play, that is capable of higher
levels of damping than the current system, may not lead to higher electrical power
production.” (Lines 400-406). To address your last point, we do think that backlash did
affect other performance measures of the device. In particular, we mention how
backlash had affected the amplitude ratio and phase angle on Lines 391-394.
line 284-285, it is stated that the “… carried weight to oscillate in the M-L direction can
uce peak forces on the user by an average 27.4%, generate electricity, …” This statement is
htly misleading as the vertical peak forces were not affected and are ~10x larger in
gnitude that the M-L forces. It should be noted here that the peak M-L forces were reduced
n average of 27.4%, not the peak forces on the user generally.
- As suggested, we included ‘medial-lateral forces’ on Line 302 to clarify that reductions
were only observed in the medial-lateral direction.
r work with suspended load backpacks suggests that the ideal configuration may be when
load is completely out-of-phase with the body. The phase angle of the load in this paper
130 +/- 20.8 degrees which decreased with higher damping. Would approaching a 180
ree phase shift be ideal for maximum energy harvesting, or is some damping necessary for
design? Why was R2 predicted to be the ideal damping ratio for maximum energy
vesting?
- When harvesting electricity using the generator, the generator will apply a torque back
on to the pendulum which will dampen the oscillations. Therefore, to generate
electricity, there must be damping. However, although more damping means more
electricity being harvested by the generator, it also decreases the oscillation amplitude
of the pendulum. Therefore, the optimal electrical power condition is predicted to be a
balance between damping the oscillations to generate electricity, but not so much as to
attenuate the amplitude of oscillations to a suboptimal level.
- Based on the reviewers comment we attempt to clarify this point in the Methods section
on lines 107-113: “By reducing the value of the electrical resistors in the circuit, the
generator harvests more electricity from the angular velocity of the pendulum. However,
this also applies more back electromotive torque on the pendulum, which increases the
overall damping of the system and leads to decreased mass oscillations. Therefore,
maximum electrical power harvested during walking is a balance between harvesting as
much electricity from the oscillations of the pendulum without damping the pendulum's
oscillations to a suboptimal point.”
ugh it’s impressive that power can be generated from M-L oscillation of a backpack without
ificant effects on the energetics and biomechanics of walking, can you put this power
eration in context? The electricity generation was only 0.22 +/- 0.3 W. A smartphone
rges at 5V and ~1-2 amps, so about 10-20 W. This device would be able to trickle-charge a
rtphone in remote areas. Is this technology worthwhile considering the added backpack
ght and cost, especially considering other comparable methods of converting mechanical
k into electricity (i.e. hand crank, footpedal, etc.)? Could more energy be harvested with
difications to your system? What is the theoretical maximum energy that could be harvested
h a M-L oscillating load? Also, human walking requires roughly 30-75 W of mechanical
er, so it would make sense that harvesting 0.22 W at a reasonable efficiency may not
ificantly affect the mechanical or metabolic cost of walking. It would be helpful to put the
er output in context.
- As suggested by the reviewer, we aim to contextualize the power generated by the
device in the Discussion Section on lines 305-317: “The advantage of the medial-lateral
oscillating load carriage device is that it is capable of harvesting electricity without
dedicated attention to its use, unlike traditional hand crank or foot pedal generators.
The 0.22+/-0.03 W of electricity generated by our device is sufficient to power smaller
portable electronics such as satellite beacons used to send distress signals (~0.006 W -
Spot Gen3)[26] or global positioning systems (GPS) used for navigation (~0.06 W -
Garmin inReach SE)[27]. Modelling predicts that an increase in electrical power
production could be achieved by increasing the weight carried. If generating over 1 W of
electrical power was desired for powering higher demand devices, such as talking or
browsing the internet with a cellphone (~0.6-1 W - Samsung Galaxy S8)[28], our model
indicates that over 20 kg of weight would need to be carried in the device. As subjects
walked with an average metabolic power of 296+/-22 W during the R3 condition,
harvesting an 0.8 W of additional electricity from the user should still have a negligible
impact on the overall energetics of locomotion.”

iewer 2: Author Response
thank the reviewer for their time reviewing the manuscript and their in-depth feedback. We
eve the comments they gave helped strengthen the analysis, interpretation, and clarity of
results. We believe we have addressed the comments brought up by the reviewer, and by
ng so, have strengthened the quality of the manuscript.
ponse to the reviewer comments (in order of appearance):
purpose of this study was to design and test a biomechanical energy harvesting backpack
utilizes movement in the medial-lateral direction. In this study the interaction between the
tromagnetic damping on a medial-lateral oscillating load carriage, walking kinematics, and
tic and electrical power generation are investigated.
paper is well written and the experiments seems to be well conceived and performed.
ve few comments that I think would improve the paper and its impact.
n Issues:
etabolic rate was calculated over only the last 2 min. Our experience and that of others has
wn that because of the variability in these measurements 2 min are not sufficient (3-4 min
preferable). Can the authors start use the data from earlier time? Typically, in our
eriments subjects reach steady-state state after 1.5 min, and we start after 3min, which is
st common in the literature.)
- As suggested by the reviewer, we re-processed all metabolic data using the last 3
minutes of the trial. However, we found that the metabolic power across conditions
changed on average by only -0.17+/-0.40 % by incorporating the extra 1 minute of data.
Also, incorporating the extra minute of metabolic data did not change conclusions drawn
(only significant difference is still Open to R3 condition, p = 0.04). Therefore, to keep the
analysis period of metabolic power the same as other gait measures (such as kinematics
and kinetics) we decided to keep the previous analysis period of 2 minutes.
- To support our decision, I have compiled a quick list of 10 studies that use a similar
analysis period for metabolic power:

during walking. Science Robotics (2018). Steady state trials were 5 min, averaged

the conclusions, the authors talk about the effect of the additional mass but do not
ntify it. I think it is important to do so. Can the authors calculate what is the required mass
he device to become worth using? As a criterion they could use the change in metabolic rate
to addition of the device mass and compared it to the metabolic rate saved using the
ice vs carrying it as a fix load. Options for equations that calculate change in metabolic rate
function of the add mass and walking speed:

vesting biomechanical energy or carrying batteries? An evaluation method based on a
parison of metabolic power. Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation, Vol 12, Issue
- As suggested by the reviewer, a discussion of device weight has been added to the
Discussion section (lines 318-328). As the metabolic power saved using the device is
small and not statistically significant (compared to the fixed mass condition), we make a
comparison of the weight of the device to the weight of batteries only. The following has
been added to address this on lines 318-328: “Assuming a lithium-ion battery's specific
energy is around 720 KJ/kg [4] a battery with an equivalent weight of our device would
contain 1584 KJ of energy. Under the conditions tested in this study (carrying 9 kg and
producing 0.22 W), a subject would need to walk 2000 hours to generate the same
amount of electrical energy. For the energy harvesting device to become a viable
alternative to carrying batteries, the weight of the device must be reduced in future
iterations. For example, if instead a subject walked with a configuration where 20 kg
was in their backpack and 1 W was being generated by the device (as predicted by our
device model). The device would need to weigh as little as 0.6 kg to be the superior
choice over batteries for a 2 week hike (assuming 8 hours of walking a day). For the
device to be considered as an alternative to batteries, future versions of the device
should consider reducing the weight or increasing the efficiency of the device.”
iscussion: In the paper, four components describe the interaction of the device with the
an (the system frequency, the phase shift, the m-l force, and the frontal plane moment).
the discussion fails to provide insight into the role of each of these components and the
raction between them. There are no references to papers that might help in providing such
nsight. Furthermore, even if such papers are not available, I think you could do it graphically
y using statistical modeling (e.g., linear mixed models with these factors explaining the
nge in metabolic rate)
- As suggested by the reviewer, we expanded our discussion on changes to the device-user
interaction across conditions. First, it is worth noting that the system’s natural frequency
and the carried mass’ oscillation frequency do not change between conditions. The
carried mass always oscillates at the same frequency as M-L COM excursions. Therefore,
we performed a linear mixed-model statistical analysis using peak M-L force, peak
frontal plane moment, and phase angle as fixed effects with interactions, subjects as a
random effect, and metabolic power as a response variable. First, from visual inspection
there was no obvious linear relationship between fixed effects and the response variable.
This was also the case with the linear mixed-model, where neither three fixed effects, or
their interactions, were statistically significant.
- As an alternative to reporting on a statistical model that has no significant predictive
power, we added an additional discussion, using previous literature when possible, on
the potential effects of device-user interaction changes on lines 347-361 in the
Discussion Section: “However, there were three changes in how the device interacted
with the user that may explain the changes observed in metabolic power. First, we
observed a reduction in the phase angle of carried mass oscillations, with respect to
trunk M-L excursions, when damping was increased. Studies that have looked at vertical
oscillating load carriage [29-31] have suggested that entirely out-of-phase oscillations,
with reduced damping, decrease mechanical work over a stride and the metabolic cost
of walking. Either the opposite relationship is true for M-L load carriage, or the phase
angle of oscillations had a negligible impact compared to other factors. The second
change in backpack-user interaction we observed was an increase in the peak M-L
interaction force with increased damping. Although no direct comparisons are known to
the authors, Ijmker [21] found that metabolic power decreased with increased M-L
stabilization force. However, the M-L forces subject's experienced in [21] were
completely out-of-phase with trunk excursions, unlike the interaction forces users
experienced with our device. As well, the difference in M-L interaction force between the
Open and R6 condition is relatively small (<2 N). Lastly, one possible reason for why we
observed this particular metabolic power difference is the device frontal plane
interaction moment. Similar to the metabolic cost,…”
cific Comments:
link for your data and code did not work. So perhaps some of the comments I have made
in fact, addressed in these files.
- As pointed out by the reviewer, the previous URL led to the main Matlab script and not
the entire repository. The URL should now be a hyperlink and properly link to the entire
database folder.
88-103: The masses of the parts and the total mass should be in table in the paper or in the
plementary information.
- As suggested by the reviewer, a table was added (Table 1) to list masses of parts and the
total mass of the device.
89: It is hard to understand form this figure how this device works; perhaps the authors
add a side view. Conceptually the figure should look something like this:
- As suggested by the reviewer, an additional figure was added to Figure 1 to show a
reduced diagram of how the device works. This can now be seen as the top-right
blowout in Figure 1. What was previously Figure 1c is now the bottom-right blowout in
Figure 1. What was previously Figure 1c has been moved to a new figure, Figure 2.
105: Again, the link for your data and code did not work. So perhaps this information is
re but if not, it would be a good idea to give the data and performance of each of the
jects.
- As discussed in an earlier comment, the URL for the study’s data repository should now
function properly. Individual subject information and data can be found there.
124: The out of phase analysis is worth a figure (if not in the main paper then at least in the
plementary information.
- As suggested by the reviewer, we included an additional figure (Figure 2b) that
demonstrates the out-of-phase oscillations of the carried mass with respect to the input
motion of the user. Another manuscript dedicated to modelling device behavior (and the
determination of the frequency ratio) has been submitted to another journal. Therefore,
we feel this analysis is outside of the scope of this paper, which we intended to be on
experimental results of subjects walking with the device alone.
127: How did the authors apply an equivalent damping ratio of 0.7?
- As the explanation of how an equivalent damping ratio is calculated isn’t discussed until
several lines after Line 127 (as noted by the reviewer), the wording in the sentence (now
line 138) was changed to: “subjects walked with the highest damped condition used in
testing (R6)”. Now, after the first mention of the equivalent damping ratio on lines 141-
143, an explanation of how it is calculated proceeds it (lines 143-148)”.
132-133: How does the damping ratio translate to the system frequency? Like this:?
<U+0001D44A>" = 1 - <U+0001D701> '
o, I recommend putting in the equation).
- To clarify the definition of damping ratio, we included the following on lines 143-144:
“The damping ratio, <U+0001D701>, is defined as the ratio of the modelled damping of the system to
the modelled critical damping for the system.” The damping ratio does relate the
damped natural frequency to the undamped natural frequency using the following
equation:
<U+0001D714>" = <U+0001D714>* 1 - <U+0001D701> '
However, because the undamped natural frequency has not been mentioned or defined
in the manuscript, we feel it is unnecessary to include this relationship. We hope that the
sentence added to the manuscript above suffices in defining the damping ratio and its
relation to the system dynamics.
, did the stepping frequency change in the different conditions?
- As most our analysis is done with reference to the gait cycle, we calculated the stride
frequency instead of the stepping frequency for each subject and condition. The stride
frequency did not significantly change between conditions as reported in the Spatial-
Temporal Gait Parameters Results Section on line 291.
re seems to be a difference in the reported sampling frequency (200 vs 100) of the motion
a in two places is it the same data?
142, 182

0 Hz and filtered using a 2nd order low-pass zero-phase Butterworth”
- As pointed out by the reviewer the sampling frequency was reported in error on second
mention in the manuscript (line 182). It has now been corrected to 200 Hz (line 193).
182: 100Hz, also here you don’t report the cut off frequency?
- As suggested we now include the cutoff frequency used in the Butterworth filter on lines
193-194.
150-152: Again, it is difficult to understand from the text what the authors are comparing.
both motions linear or angular?
- As suggested, we clarified on lines 161-163 that both motions are the linear M-L
displacement of the carried mass and input motion.
156 -163: It will be good if the authors could add to figure 1 the force sensor location and
they mounted the sensor to measure both the force and moments.
- As suggested, a side view of the load cell mount between device and backpack frame is
now shown as the center-right blowout in Figure 1.
191-192: Should be joint kinematics were calculated using XXX [e.g. bottom-up approach
nter 2009)], and segment mass center and moment of inertia where calculated using [25].
- The method used to calculate joint kinematics and kinetics is referenced earlier in the
paragraph (lines 191-192). Therefore, to address the need for clarity as mentioned by the
reviewer, we changed the sentence on lines 203-204 to: “Segment mass centre and the
moment of inertia of limb segments were determined using [25].”
214: Why do the authors think that R2 condition would be the best? I think they should let
readers know.
- As suggested, we first clarify in the Methods Section the underlying principles for why a
condition may generate more electricity than another (lines 107-113): “By reducing the
value of the electrical resistors in the circuit, the generator harvests more electricity from
the angular velocity of the pendulum. However, this also applies more back
electromotive torque on the pendulum, which increases the overall damping of the
system and leads to decreased mass oscillations. Therefore, maximum electrical power
harvested during walking is a balance between harvesting as much electricity from the
oscillations of the pendulum without damping the pendulum's oscillations to a
suboptimal point.”
- Then, we re-iterate this point in the Results Section as suggested by the reviewer (lines
226-229): “This suggests that the balance between harvesting the most electricity from
pendulum oscillations, without damping the pendulum's oscillations to a suboptimal
point, occurs at higher damping ratios than what was predicted by the model.”
244-55: Was there difference between the different harvesting conditions?
- As suggested by the reviewer, we also report the significant differences between
oscillating conditions on lines 258-260: “There was a significant decrease in the peak
moment during the R3 condition compared to the Open (p = 0.04) and R1 (p = 0.04)
condition. As well, there was a significant decrease in the peak moment in the R2
condition compared to the Open condition (p = 0.04).”
258: In the figure you write Abd/add in the text you use frontal plane, I know you mean
same. Yet for clarity you might want to write something like Abd/add (frontal plane) or use
same wording in both places.
- As suggested, we added (abd/add) after the use of ‘frontal plane’ in text (line 276).
338-340: Not clear how the peak power was affected by the backlash.
- As suggested by the reviewer, we clarified how peak power was affected by backlash on
lines 395-400: “The R2 condition was predicted by the model to be the best balance
between harvesting the most electricity from pendulum oscillations, without damping
the pendulum's oscillations to a suboptimal point. However, since the effective damping
achieved was less than what was modelled, a condition with higher modelled damping
(R5) ended up producing the most electrical power.”
370-373: How did the step width change with the different harvesting conditions and how
is related (if at all) to the frontal torque?
- There was no significant difference in step width between conditions as reported in the
Results Section 3.4 (lines 291-292). If there had been a difference in the step width, this
may have affected the frontal plane interaction torque. This is because wider steps tend
to lead to greater trunk M-L input motion, which leads to increases mass oscillation
amplitude and frontal plane moments developed by the backpack.
