The submitted manuscript details an investigation electricity transmission corridors in
extensively forested Swedish landscapes and the effect they have on bumblebee abundance and
diversity. The authors found no effect of these corridors on bumblebee abundance and diversity,
but the corridors themselves provided suitable resources for number of regionally threatened
species. The paper should be of interest for land managers and conservation biologists looking at
ways of managing forested landscapes for the benefit of bumblebee populations.
However, I have a number of concerns with the submitted manuscript that are detailed below.
There is a serious lack of detail in the methods and it is not clear exactly how bumblebee surveys
were conducted. Moreover, the standard of English is average to poor, with numerous poorly
phrased run-on sentences. I have pointed out a few but the whole manuscript needs to be
checked and rewritten for clarity where necessary. I don’t have time to correct all the basic
grammar mistakes so working through the paper with a native English speaker is recommended.
Major points
L31-32. I feel that the abstract needs a little more structure as the reader does not really know
what was studied and surveyed. What areas were compared with the transmission corridors –
semi-natural grasslands, farmlands, any area within a certain radius? I know you can’t put too
much in but a brief description would be good. e.g. L35 – what semi-natural grasslands?
L64-68. This sentence is badly phrased and confusingly written. Please break it down into smaller
sections.
L71-72. However, the most spectacular European bumblebee declines (certainly in W. Europe)
occurred in the 1950-1980 period – are there not more relevant statistics to cite than 1990-2003?
L87-91. Again, a very cumbersome sentence. Split this up, separate road verges and transmission
corridors.
L92-94. You have split the sentence, move habitats to immediate after improved, i.e. has
improved habitat quality for threatened etc.
L95-96. Why is this reference not included with the previous examples? Give more details. It also
breaks up this sentence awkwardly.
L97. The habitat created by transmission corridors can hardly be considered ‘unique’! Low-
intensity grasslands, agriculture, mineral extraction, human habitation and areas with soil too
poor to support trees produce habitats with similar characteristics.
L111-118. This is confusingly written. For a start this is too much detail for the introduction, put it
in the methods! You want a general introduction, we looked at seven habitat types in areas with
and without transmission corridors in Sweden. Keep it simple. Detail in the methods. What is a
disturbed habitat and a semi-natural habitat? You say at L111 you looked at seven semi-natural
habitats does this include disturbed habitats? It needs to be simplified and clarified. 1156km2 –
this is not helpful as it cannot be visualised. If you want to show the geographic extent of your
study a map would be much better.
L119-126. All these questions need rewriting as straightforward hypotheses. At the moment they
are woollily phrased and unclear. Question 4 is particularly poor – relative to what?
3
L131-132. Uneconomic to cultivate because it is in forest? Uplands with no forest and poor soil?
Bordered by woodland or in woodland? If it is the case just say that 36,000 ha pass through
woodland and so consequently require frequent maintenance.
L140-141. What does purely mechanical means mean? Surely people are involved? Also, you
don’t need to give the date of the personal communication or the person’s affiliation)
L143-144. Are these areas squares (2x2) or circles (2km radius) as stated earlier? Please be specific
L159-160. I am confused – what is the difference between the transmission corridor (50-70m) and
the transmission line corridor (10m)?
L165-168. The information on the transects is severely lacking. How many transects per area?
Where are the habitats described as listed below L147-148? Did each area have a representative of
each habitat type? Please list and describe each habitat type. How do you account for uneven
survey effort in each area? How were habitats type chosen and characterised?
L187-188. Why did you not distinguish between pollen and nectar foraging trips? Separating
pollen and nectar visits can result in quite different plants being important for each visit type and
this stratified data is much more ecologically relevant than lumped data.
L189-190. A general comment, please could you be consistent with terminology and use either
site or area when talking about 2x2 blocks. Was every habitat type in each site surveyed on the
same day?
L244-252. What costs? You still have not stated what is being compared with what!
L277-279. Given that pollen and nectar visits were lumped, and no distinction was made between
male and worker bumblebees, these conclusions are not justified. Carduus and Centaurea will be
predominantly nectar plants whereas Fabaceae are extremely important for the pollen diets of
threatened bumblebees e.g. Kleijn and Raemakers 2008 Ecology, Goulson, Lye and Darvil 2008
Biodiversity and Conservation. More discussion on this point is warranted.
L305. What do you mean by ‘grasslands’? The extent of grasslands (including permanent pasture,
grazing land, high-input silage grassland etc) is most definitely not 10% of its original extent. I
assume you mean semi-natural grassland?
L347-349. Sowing red clover in these areas is a peculiar recommendation. These transmission
corridors are in a state of arrested early succession – if red clover can grow there it will do so. The
comparison with the UK’s AES is odd, since establishing field margins in arable fields with
annual mowing etc is very different to sowing plants into essentially forested environments.
Moreover the enormous variation in the stated costs makes this comparison almost worthless.
L390-392. This is not the case. For example, in the UK there are many nature reserves (maintained
by organisations like the National Trust) that receive Higher Level Stewardship AES funding to
carry out nature conservation work.

There is a great interest in landscape effects on bee conservation and the potential of using public
lands to promote pollinator diversity. Electrical transmission corridors have been one of the land
types that researchers have expressed interest in exploring for the potential benefits to bees. Hill
& Bartomeus explore this, but do so in a study that is not well suited to explore the benefits of
this land type. There are a small number of sites (5 with and 5 without corridors), relatively small
number of specimens (~1000; some of these not collected meaning the richness estimates are not
verifiable) and importantly sites all have a high proportion of semi-natural habitat (45-70%)
which would potentially mask the potential value of this proportionally small land cover class).
The most problematic aspect of this manuscript as written is that the conclusions drawn, which
are summarized in the title "Maintained electrical transmission corridors can provide valuable
bumble bee habitat for conservation and ecosystem service provision" are not supported by the
results. There was no effect on richness or abundance of bumble bees when transmission
corridors were present. There was no difference in total bumble bee abundance or richness across
habitat types, nor was there an effect on service providing species. Some of the rarer bees were
more common in certain habitats, including transmission corridors, but these corridors were not
particularly good for these bees (Fig. 3B). As such I feel the conclusions drawn in this study are
not in line with the results. The significant effects that were seen (floral density increases bee
abundance and richness & rare bees are more common in some habitats than others) are not
particularly novel. I would be happy to see these data/results published if they were presented
differently

label_comment_3
The authors have made a number of changes to the manuscript to scale back its conclusions to
bring it into line with the data presented and efforts have been made to improve its readability.
Essentially, the addition of a small transmission corridor made no difference to bumblebee
abundance or diversity at the landscape scale. However, the transmission corridors did provide
habitat of a quality that was broadly in line with semi-natural grasslands. The authors highlight
the low maintenance costs relative to conventional management strategies. Overall, the
manuscript is of interest for its assessment of differential land management techniques in
northerly temperate latitudes, their relative costs and local impacts on wild bumblebee
populations.
I still have a few concerns about the written English and I have a few more queries in specific
places.
Major comments
L89-90 increasing or decreasing mowing intensity?
L140-142 your references are the wrong way around
L170 why were transects walked back and forth? This will inevitably lead to double counting of
bumblebees, inflating the abundance metric.
L310 why is it remarkable that transmission corridors sustain similar densities of foraging
bumblebees as semi-natural grasslands? Any why is it relevant that semi-natural grasslands have
declined?
L312-315 what is particularly true for rare bumblebees?
L744-763 the figure legends 2 and 3 are confusing and poorly worded. Describe the relationship
that is being shown simply. Don’t talk about significance, that should in the text. Figure 4 is better

The paper is a fine contribution that examines the potential benefits of power line right-of-ways
for bumblebee habitat. This will be useful for conservationists and policy-makers.
There are a few additions I would like to see in the final manuscript to help clarify the results.
The first is a table summarizing the bee collections. The raw data are available, but it would be
useful to include a summary table of the species captured. It may be of interest and support the
conclusion to mention that Bombus muscorum was only captured in a corridor. And that 3/4 of
B. humilis were also from corridors.
It would be useful to provide more details and clarity on what the different habitats were. The
pictures in the supplementary information help, but were roadsides always embedded in grassy
areas? Or did they sometimes pass through other habitats? Same question for 'drains'.
Incidentally, I usually consider a drain something in the bottom of my sink, whereas I think the
more common word for what you sampled is 'ditch'. Where crop edges always these shrubby
habitats next to woods? Were samples from woods from clearings or trails through the woods?
Perhaps the most surprising result of this paper to me, was how good roads appear to be. But
this doesn't warrant mention in the abstract although it seems they show about as much potential
as the corridors. I know that wasn't the original intention of the paper, but it might be worth
highlighting.
A minor correction: Melissa should not be capitalized in the Karner Blue species name.

The paper is a fine contribution that examines the potential benefits of power line right-of-ways
for bumblebee habitat. This will be useful for conservationists and policy-makers.
There are a few additions I would like to see in the final manuscript to help clarify the results.
The first is a table summarizing the bee collections. The raw data are available, but it would be
useful to include a summary table of the species captured. It may be of interest and support the
conclusion to mention that Bombus muscorum was only captured in a corridor. And that 3/4 of
B. humilis were also from corridors.
It would be useful to provide more details and clarity on what the different habitats were. The
pictures in the supplementary information help, but were roadsides always embedded in grassy
areas? Or did they sometimes pass through other habitats? Same question for 'drains'.
Incidentally, I usually consider a drain something in the bottom of my sink, whereas I think the
more common word for what you sampled is 'ditch'. Where crop edges always these shrubby
habitats next to woods? Were samples from woods from clearings or trails through the woods?
Perhaps the most surprising result of this paper to me, was how good roads appear to be. But
this doesn't warrant mention in the abstract although it seems they show about as much potential
as the corridors. I know that wasn't the original intention of the paper, but it might be worth
highlighting.
A minor correction: Melissa should not be capitalized in the Karner Blue species name.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have made a number of changes to the manuscript to scale back its conclusions to
bring it into line with the data presented and efforts have been made to improve its readability.
Essentially, the addition of a small transmission corridor made no difference to bumblebee
abundance or diversity at the landscape scale. However, the transmission corridors did provide
habitat of a quality that was broadly in line with semi-natural grasslands. The authors highlight
the low maintenance costs relative to conventional management strategies. Overall, the
manuscript is of interest for its assessment of differential land management techniques in
northerly temperate latitudes, their relative costs and local impacts on wild bumblebee
populations.
I still have a few concerns about the written English and I have a few more queries in specific
places.

Comments to the Author(s)
The submitted manuscript details an investigation electricity transmission corridors in
extensively forested Swedish landscapes and the effect they have on bumblebee
abundance and diversity. The authors found no effect of these corridors on bumblebee
abundance and diversity, but the corridors themselves provided suitable resources for
number of regionally threatened species. The paper should be of interest for land managers
and conservation biologists looking at ways of managing forested landscapes for the benefit
of bumblebee populations.
However, I have a number of concerns with the submitted manuscript that are detailed
below. There is a serious lack of detail in the methods and it is not clear exactly how
bumblebee surveys were conducted. Moreover, the standard of English is average to poor,
with numerous poorly phrased run-on sentences. I have pointed out a few but the whole
manuscript needs to be checked and rewritten for clarity where necessary. I don’t have
time to correct all the basic grammar mistakes so working through the paper with a native
English speaker is recommended.
We thank reviewer 1 for their comments on our manuscript. We have carefully edited the
article as per reviewer suggestions. We have addressed all concerns raised and we want to
thank you for helping us enhancing this manuscript. A native English speaker, in addition to
one of the authors who is also a native English speaker, has revised the text to correct all
grammatical mistakes and we changed the wording of most paragraphs to some degree.
1. L31-32. I feel that the abstract needs a little more structure as the reader does not
really know what was studied and surveyed. What areas were compared with the
transmission corridors – semi-natural grasslands, farmlands, any area within a
certain radius? I know you can’t put too much in but a brief description would be
good. e.g. L35 – what semi-natural grasslands?
We added a brief sentence explaining the sampling design. See lines 32-35.
2. L64-68. This sentence is badly phrased and confusingly written. Please break it
down into smaller sections.
We rephrased it for clarity. See new lines 42-44
3. L71-72. However, the most spectacular European bumblebee declines (certainly in
W. Europe) occurred in the 1950-1980 period – are there not more relevant
statistics to cite than 1990-2003?
We couldn’t find other comprehensive estimates for Europe as a whole, only for
individual countries. However, 1990-2003 is representative of the recent grassland
declines and directly related to our question, which is based on contemporary
corridor contribution as bumble bee habitat.
4. L87-91. Again, a very cumbersome sentence. Split this up, separate road verges and
transmission corridors.
This section has been split into separate sentences. The paragraph has been
reformatted. See new lines 86-96.
5. L92-94. You have split the sentence, move habitats to immediate after improved,
i.e. has improved habitat quality for threatened etc.
This has been fixed.
6. L95-96. Why is this reference not included with the previous examples? Give more
details. It also breaks up this sentence awkwardly.
This sentence (and the reference) was redundant and we deleted it.
7. L97. The habitat created by transmission corridors can hardly be considered
‘unique’! Low-intensity grasslands, agriculture, mineral extraction, human
habitation and areas with soil too poor to support trees produce habitats with
similar characteristics.
This has been changed. Refer to line 99.
8. L111-118. This is confusingly written. For a start this is too much detail for the
introduction, put it in the methods! You want a general introduction, we looked at
seven habitat types in areas with and without transmission corridors in Sweden.
Keep it simple. Detail in the methods. What is a disturbed habitat and a semi-
natural habitat? You say at L111 you looked at seven semi-natural habitats does
this include disturbed habitats? It needs to be simplified and clarified. 1156km2 –
this is not helpful as it cannot be visualised. If you want to show the geographic
extent of your study a map would be much better.
This paragraph has been re-written and the detail moved to the method section.
See new lines 110-117.
9. L119-126. All these questions need rewriting as straightforward hypotheses. At the
moment they are woollily phrased and unclear. Question 4 is particularly poor –
relative to what?
We removed the question section and re-write the last paragraph to include the
specific expectations in plain words. See lines 110-117.
10. L131-132. Uneconomic to cultivate because it is in forest? Uplands with no forest
and poor soil? Bordered by woodland or in woodland? If it is the case just say that
36,000 ha pass through woodland and so consequently require frequent
maintenance.
This sentence has been amended. Refer to lines 122-123.
11. L140-141. What does purely mechanical means mean? Surely people are involved?
Also, you don’t need to give the date of the personal communication or the
person’s affiliation)
This sentence has been amended, refer to lines 130-131. Note the date of the
personal communication (2014, 3 December) and person’s affiliation (SK) have
been given for completeness, but we are happy to remove them if the editor also
thinks it’s unnecessary.
12. L143-144. Are these areas squares (2x2) or circles (2km radius) as stated earlier?
Please be specific
We apologise for this confusion and we have corrected this throughout. These are
square areas (2x2km).
13. L159-160. I am confused – what is the difference between the transmission corridor
(50-70m) and the transmission line corridor (10m)?
We removed this clarification because we agree is confusing and do not add any
relevant information. Our focus through the paper is always on transmission
corridor (50-70m wide) as is now stated.
14. L165-168. The information on the transects is severely lacking. How many transects
per area? Where are the habitats described as listed below L147-148? Did each
area have a representative of each habitat type? Please list and describe each
habitat type. How do you account for uneven survey effort in each area? How were
habitats type chosen and characterised?
We added information of number of habitats per site and habitat, refer to lines
150-157. As analysis are always in terms of abundance or richness per transect and
never calculate pooled abundance or richness per habitat, the unequal sampling do
not affect the analysis (anova type analysis are robust to moderately unbalanced
designs). A photo of the habitat types characterized can be found in Supplementary
Material Figure S2.
15. L187-188. Why did you not distinguish between pollen and nectar foraging trips?
Separating pollen and nectar visits can result in quite different plants being
important for each visit type and this stratified data is much more ecologically
relevant than lumped data.
This is a very good point, unfortunately we didn’t separate this two variables.
However, as both nectar and pollen are important components, we think our
estimates are representative of plants use by bumble bees. We added a caveat in
discussion regarding this issue and highlight that is unfortunate we can’t separate
plants contribution. See lines 366-369.
16. L189-190. A general comment, please could you be consistent with terminology
and use either site or area when talking about 2x2 blocks. Was every habitat type
in each site surveyed on the same day?
We apologise for this. We now refer to the 2x2km squares as sites throughout.
Refer to lines 184-186.
17. L244-252. What costs? You still have not stated what is being compared with what!
Again we apologise. The comparison between the costs of managing roadsides,
semi-natural grasslands and transmission is now clear. Refer to lines 244-245.
18. L277-279. Given that pollen and nectar visits were lumped, and no distinction was
made between male and worker bumblebees, these conclusions are not justified.
Carduus and Centaurea will be predominantly nectar plants whereas Fabaceae are
extremely important for the pollen diets of threatened bumblebees e.g. Kleijn and
Raemakers 2008 Ecology, Goulson, Lye and Darvil 2008 Biodiversity and
Conservation. More discussion on this point is warranted.
We agree it’s an important point to highlight. We expanded the discussion on this
point in lines 366-369.
19. L305. What do you mean by ‘grasslands’? The extent of grasslands (including
permanent pasture, grazing land, high-input silage grassland etc) is most definitely
not 10% of its original extent. I assume you mean semi-natural grassland?
In this instance and throughout the rest of the manuscript we have referred to
semi-natural grasslands only.
20. L347-349. Sowing red clover in these areas is a peculiar recommendation. These
transmission corridors are in a state of arrested early succession – if red clover can
grow there it will do so. The comparison with the UK’s AES is odd, since
establishing field margins in arable fields with annual mowing etc is very different
to sowing plants into essentially forested environments. Moreover the enormous
variation in the stated costs makes this comparison almost worthless.
In the corridors we studied there were areas that were open and weren’t occupied
by clover or any other forage plant. The access roads are one such area. We have
therefore reworded this paragraph (refer to our lines 372-375) and suggested that
sowing seeds of nectar rich flowers on areas such as roads post maintenance is a
possibility. As an indicative cost of doing this we have referred to the lower cost
(€42/ha/yr) only.
21. L390-392. This is not the case. For example, in the UK there are many nature
reserves (maintained by organisations like the National Trust) that receive Higher
Level Stewardship AES funding to carry out nature conservation work.
Thank you and point taken. We have amended this (refer to our lines 395-398) and
stated that the areas of corridors like those we surveyed aren’t eligible for AES
funding via CAP. These areas don’t meet the criteria as stated in the referenced EU
regulation.
Minor points
22. L32. add (Bombus spp.)
Done, refer to line 33.
23. L41-42. This is just a repetition of L34-37. Consider rephrasing.
We re-phrased it, but keep the general idea as is the main take home message we
want to give. Refer to lines 42-44.
24. L54. repetition of essential
Amended, changed to “important”. Refer to line 55.
25. L65. comma after references
Sentence has been split and there is no need for a comma now.
26. L81. From policy makers
Done, refer to line 83.
27. L92. Why abbreviate when you never mention it again?
The abbreviation has been removed
28. L94-96. Consider citing the work of M.A.K. Sydenham
Thanks for the suggestion, we already were citing one of his papers, and we added
another very relevant one for this topic. Refer to line 98.
29. L108-109. ‘with that’ be more specific
This section has been rewritten, refer to line 110.
30. L132-133. Rewrite this sentence, badly phrased. Actually, delete it, irrelevant to the
manuscript.
It has been deleted
31. L159. Standardise decimal places
Done through text.
32. L178-179. I assume you mean area, not space?
Yes, we meant area. This has been amended, refer to line 169.
33. L293-294. You can’t have one price range for two different schemes! Please give a
range for each scheme type.
The sentences containing these prices have been removed.
34. L303. Is significant as in Sweden??? Rephrase
This sentence has been rephrased. Refer to lines 308-313.
35. L312. Badly phrased sentence introduction, rewrite

Comments to the Author(s)
There is a great interest in landscape effects on bee conservation and the potential of using
public lands to promote pollinator diversity. Electrical transmission corridors have been one
of the land types that researchers have expressed interest in exploring for the potential
benefits to bees. Hill & Bartomeus explore this, but do so in a study that is not well suited
to explore the benefits of this land type.
1. There are a small number of sites (5 with and 5 without corridors), relatively small
number of specimens (~1000; some of these not collected meaning the richness
estimates are not verifiable) and importantly sites all have a high proportion of
semi-natural habitat (45-70%) which would potentially mask the potential value of
this proportionally small land cover class).
While we agree that would be great to have more sites, our sampling design is
structured as to have as much replicates as possible within sites. We are up front
recognizing that our first analysis comparing sites has low power (see lines 367-
368), but the test across habitats is well replicated with more than 150 transects
nested in 10 different areas (and area is accounted in the model as random factor
to avoid the possible non independence of the data). We added a formal
calculation of the power to detect representative differences to reinforce the
validity of our results (lines 226-227, 283-287). Second, we provided rarefaction
curves showing the appropriateness of our sampling to detect species richness
adequately (sup mat S3) and we correct for sampling effort when needed in the
analysis. Third, we see our design using fixed amounts of semi-natural habitat at
the landscape level as an advantage, because we get rid of a very important
confounding variable (landscape composition). The effort to cross a landscape
gradient design while still surveying multiple habitats was out of our capabilities.
Said that, you are right that the results may be different for situations where
minimal semi-natural areas are present and we highlight this caveat in the
discussion and is now reflected on the title, which now refers explicitly to forested
areas. See lines 426-428.
2. The most problematic aspect of this manuscript as written is that the conclusions
drawn, which are summarized in the title "Maintained electrical transmission
corridors can provide valuable bumble bee habitat for conservation and ecosystem
service provision" are not supported by the results.
We understand that lack of differences between grasslands and powerlines is not
the same as demonstrating they are equal, but we believe we provide several lines
of evidence showing that powerlines has the potential to contribute to bumble
habitat. However, we have tone down the claims through the article editing several
passages and changing the title to a more conservative statement.
3. There was no effect on richness or abundance of bumble bees when transmission
corridors were present. There was no difference in total bumble bee abundance or
richness across habitat types, nor was there an effect on service providing species.
Some of the rarer bees were more common in certain habitats, including
transmission corridors, but these corridors were not particularly good for these
bees (Fig. 3B).
As stated above, we added the calculation of the power to detect differences in our
data and show that power to detect habitat differences is above 60% (which is the
default threshold for an ANOVA type analysis). We clarified throughout the
manuscript that we find no differences given the power of our analysis, so readers
can judge by themselves. See lines 226-227, 283-287.
4. As such I feel the conclusions drawn in this study are not in line with the results.
The significant effects that were seen (floral density increases bee abundance and
richness & rare bees are more common in some habitats than others) are not
particularly novel.
We agree that this result is not particularly novel, but is still interesting to report,
specially related to rare species, which we would like to highlight are not correlated
with flower abundance. This is interesting because indicates that while common
species are dependant simply on flower abundance, rare species may have other
requirements, like particular flowers or adequate nesting sites.
5. I would be happy to see these data/results published if they were presented
differently
We tried to be more careful with our wording and highlight the novelty of the data
presented and we believe we can make a good contribution to highlight the
potential role of powerlines for conservation.

Increasing. We clarified it.

Thanks, we corrected this.
L170 why were transects walked back and forth? This will inevitably lead to double
counting of bumblebees, inflating the abundance metric.
Given the slow pace we walked and that most bumblebees were caught and released
(and hence scared away), we think that double counting are unlikely. In any case, this will
affect all sites, making relative comparisons valid.
L310 why is it remarkable that transmission corridors sustain similar densities of foraging
bumblebees as semi-natural grasslands? Any why is it relevant that semi-natural
grasslands have declined? L312-315 what is particularly true for rare bumblebees?
