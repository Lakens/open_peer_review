The authors studied two components of social immunity in the honeybee - glucose oxidase GOX
and the antmicrobial peptide Def1, which are produced by the workers and provided to the
larvae. They tested if GOX and Def1 were constitutively expressed or induced after exposure to
American Foulbrood. They can clearly document the absence of any induced changes and
conclude that both show constitutive expression.
The study is clear, concise and well written.
Major comments
1) I would think the study would benefit from a broader introduction and discussion, ie not
focusing only on social immunits of honeybees, but also include other groups of social insects.
2) methods:
- it did not become clear if the 5 frame nucleus colonies were distributed equally into the 8 test
colonies (ie one ABS treatment each for each of the mother colonies, controls similar, but only 3)?

- I also did not quite understand the 7 day and 14 day sampling of the bees; how can the bees be
collected in week 3 14 d after AFB? or is it rather that all bees were then frozen after week 4 - stil

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In this manuscript, the authors investigate the role of Glucose oxidase and Defensin-1 as part of
the defence repertoire of honeybees in response to American Foulbrood infection of larvae. They
found that neither Glucose oxidase nor Defensin-1 were upregulated in response to infection and
conclude that these defences are constitutively expressed.
While I think, the manuscript is overall interesting, I think the authors should consider to address
issues raised below. Unfortunately, the manuscript does not have line numbers, but I hope my
comments will nonetheless be understandable.
Introduction:
I think the authors should maybe also cite the definitions of Cotter and Kilner 2010 and Meunier
2015 on the concept of social immunity and not only Cremer et al. 2007, as a collective use of
Glucose oxidase and Definsin-1 was not investigated but rather a potential benefit to relatives.
The authors could for example include the last sentence of the first paragraph in the discussion to
make this clear. Moreover, the definition of external immune defence (second paragraph, third
sentence in the introduction) is slightly wrong, as external immune defence traits often include
but are not based on antimicrobial compounds. They were defined as any heritable trait that
impacts environmental microbes and manipulates them in favour of the organism employing
them. As such, they include for example hygienic behaviour in honeybees and it could be argued
that they include most defence traits described under the concept of social immunity (defence
traits in social insects that target only a single individual would be selfish defence traits.
Generally, I wonder why the authors decided to look at Glucose oxidase and Defensin-1 upon
infection of larvae with American foulbrood. In the last paragraph of the introduction the authors
state that both are produced in the hypopharyngeal gland of honeybees and likely act to sanitize
food. Did the authors expect that honeybees would medicate their offspring through elevated
levels of Glucose oxidase and Defensin-1 in the food? If yes, this would maybe make a better
introduction than social immune defence. If not, then I think that the authors should consider the
fact of context dependent induction of immune defences, i.e. larval infection vs. food
contamination, to discuss their findings.
Material and Methods
Experimental design:
It is not clear to me how the authors could collect 30 spores from an infected colony, but then
have a final concentration of 1.5X10^7 spores/ml. Did the authors use these initial spores to infect
larvae from which they then harvested more spores for infection? If yes, please say so.
Another point that is not clear to me, is why the authors infected each colony twice. Please
explain the rational for this.
4
Gene expression:
Please report the primers used or at least point to literature were they are described.
Statistical Analysis:
The fragment: “For the enzymatic GOX data, ‘date of the assay’”, is not clear for me.
Moreover, as colonies were repeatedly measured over time, I think that the authors, in addition
to colony, also need to include time in the random effects to account for this.
Finally, it is not clear to me how the authors analysed levels of American foulbrood symptoms.
What were the dependent variables? Anyway, as control colonies never showed symptoms and
the authors apparently do not want to describe statistical differences in infection levels over time
in the treated colonies, no statistic is needed in my opinion.
Discussion:
Although the only significant effect in the study was a decrease in Glucose oxidase and Defensin-
1 at timepoint T1 the authors marginalize this effect in the discussion by describing it as slight
reduction (third sentence, first paragraph). This is in my opinion wrong and I think the authors
should either try to explain this effect (for example they could argue that this effect might stem
from a trade-off between different levels of immune defence, i.e. larval protection against food
protection; see also comment above on context dependent expression of immune defences) or
simply state that they do not know what caused this effect.
Also, I think the authors should refrain from describing results which they do not present in the
result section. They write in the fourth sentence, second paragraph that their data show an effect
of colony on levels of Glucose oxidase, but they never show this effect in the result section either
graphically in Figure 2 or as a statistical significant effect, which I agree would be difficult as
colony was included as a random effect in the model and p-values are difficult to associate with
random-effects.
Table 1:
The table shows only 2 control colonies, but Material and Methods mentions 3 (first sentence
under the header Experimental design). Can you please explain why?
Figure 1:
I think that the authors should try to restrict themselves only to literature involving honeybees
with a thorough literature research. Currently, they miss a lot of literature from other social
insects, which I agree would almost be impossible to summarize (see for example Tragust 2016
for the current literature of only venom and Metapleural gland secretions in ants as external
immune defence)

The authors have satisfactorily amended issues raised on a previous version of the manuscript.
Especially the final paragraph of the introduction has substantially improved. While I still do not
agree with some of the changes made by the authors (i.e. (1) exclusion of the definition of social
immunity by Cotter and Kilner 2010 (line 38-40), although this definition explicitly addresses
actions performed for the benefit of relatives, which is exactly what the authors look at in their

(line 50-52), although I tried to clarify in the first version of the manuscript that external immune
defence, as originally defined, includes immune defence traits described under the concept of
social immunity in social insects and not the other way round), I believe that these disagreements
lie within the ability of researchers to subjectively interpret existing literature and should not
hinder publication.

Dear Editors,
Thank you for considering our manuscript, “Inducible versus constitutive social immunity:
Examining effects of colony infection on glucose oxidase and Defensin-1 production in honey
bees”, RSOS-170224, for publication in Royal Society Open Access.
In this study, we test the inducibility of the enzyme glucose oxidase and the antimicrobial peptide
defensin-1 in honey bee colonies after colonies are challenged with a bacterial larval disease. Our results
show that the levels of production of these compounds do not change in the presence of a bacterial
infection, and suggest they are used prophylactically in honey bees. These findings imply that these two
components of the honey bee immune system have been co-opted for social immunity.
We have made a number of revisions in response to the comments we received on our initial
submission. In brief, we have expanded the number and breadth of references in figure 1; we have
clarified some sections of the methods; and we have revised and made more explicit our hypotheses and
predictions. For details on specific changes made, please see the file uploaded as Response to
Reviewers (our responses are in blue italics), which specifies changes with line numbers.
Thank you very much for your consideration. We greatly appreciate the time that you and the reviewers
spent examining our manuscript.

The authors studied two components of social immunity in the honeybee - glucose oxidase GOX and the
antmicrobial peptide Def1, which are produced by the workers and provided to the larvae. They tested if GOX and
Def1 were constitutively expressed or induced after exposure to American Foulbrood. They can clearly document
the absence of any induced changes and conclude that both show constitutive expression.
The study is clear, concise and well written.
Major comments
1) I would think the study would benefit from a broader introduction and discussion, ie not focusing only on social
immunits of honeybees, but also include other groups of social insects.
While we agree that the introduction could be broader, we decided to follow the suggestion made by reviewer #2,
and we now mostly focus on the honey bee literature. We however cite papers from other organisms, including
ants, grasshoppers and caterpillars as appropriate. While the framework of the paper focuses on larger issues
regarding inducible vs. constitutive social immune responses, the specific focus is simply on GOX and Def1
changes in nurse bees in response to colony-level pathogen exposure. Our concern is that too much exposition
would detract from the major points and so have kept the manuscript relatively concise. The supplemental file,
which is referenced in the manuscript and figure legend, does a more thorough job including other social insect
work as justification for the location of points for Figure 1 and we have done are best to include as many references
as possible to make our case.
2) methods:
- it did not become clear if the 5 frame nucleus colonies were distributed equally into the 8 test colonies (ie one ABS
treatment each for each of the mother colonies, controls similar, but only 3)? is the random factor in the stats
referring exactly to this colony origin, or simply a colony number as given in Table 1 ?
The random factor is referring to colony origin. The colonies were headed by sister queens, but not derived from
splits from a single colony of origin.
- table 1 only contains 2 control colonies, one is mising
We lost one of the control colonies during the first week of the experiment because the queen was unfortunately
killed. We have now clarified that in line 94.
- I also did not quite understand the 7 day and 14 day sampling of the bees; how can the bees be collected in week
3 14 d after AFB? or is it rather that all bees were then frozen after week 4 - stil all a bit unclear, describe better
The age of the bees is independent of the time when the colonies were infected with AFB. Newly emerged bees
were marked at 3 different points during our experiment: (1) on week 1 of the experiment = before infection (T0), (2)
on week 3 of the experiment = the week we infected colonies (T1), and (3) on week 5 = two weeks after colonies
were infected with AFB. All of these details are described in detail in Table 1. We also changed the wording in the
methods section to make this point clearer (L104-112).
Minor comments:
- please define terms such as "hygienic behavior" at first time used. This is a technical term describing the removal
of sick brood, something that may not become directly obvious from its name.
We have now defined hygienic behavior as the ‘ability of workers to remove diseased brood from the nest’ in line
45.
- fig 1; cite Wheeler 1911 for the superorganism concept
We have added the citation.
- fig 2: write in the legend, what is shown in the boxplots (e g median and what is depicted otherwise ?
We have now done so.
- it is metaplEural glands (throghout)
We have now changed this word in the main manuscript and supplement.
In the supplement:
- resin use: replace " ant papers, my work" by proper references
We have now done so and thank the reviewer for catching this error.
- also ants show hygienic behavior , see Tragust et al 2013 BMC EvolBiol
We have now done so.
- also self medication occurs in ants, see Bos et al 2015 Evolution
We have now done so.

In this manuscript, the authors investigate the role of Glucose oxidase and Defensin-1 as part of the defence
repertoire of honeybees in response to American Foulbrood infection of larvae. They found that neither Glucose
oxidase nor Defensin-1 were upregulated in response to infection and conclude that these defences are
constitutively expressed.
While I think, the manuscript is overall interesting, I think the authors should consider to address issues raised
below. Unfortunately, the manuscript does not have line numbers, but I hope my comments will nonetheless be
understandable.
Thanks for your positive assessment. We apologize about not having line numbers in our first submission. We have
now added lines to the new version of the manuscript and we refer to line numbers to address each of your
comments.
Introduction:
I think the authors should maybe also cite the definitions of Cotter and Kilner 2010 and Meunier 2015 on the
concept of social immunity and not only Cremer et al. 2007, as a collective use of Glucose oxidase and Definsin-1
was not investigated but rather a potential benefit to relatives. The authors could for example include the last
sentence of the first paragraph in the discussion to make this clear.
We have now done so.
Moreover, the definition of external immune defence (second paragraph, third sentence in the introduction) is
slightly wrong, as external immune defence traits often include but are not based on antimicrobial compounds.
They were defined as any heritable trait that impacts environmental microbes and manipulates them in favour of the
organism employing them. As such, they include for example hygienic behaviour in honeybees and it could be
argued that they include most defence traits described under the concept of social immunity (defence traits in social
insects that target only a single individual would be selfish defence traits.
We have now removed the word ‘external’ from this sentence to avoid this confusion (L50).
Generally, I wonder why the authors decided to look at Glucose oxidase and Defensin-1 upon infection of larvae
with American foulbrood. In the last paragraph of the introduction the authors state that both are produced in the
hypopharyngeal gland of honeybees and likely act to sanitize food. Did the authors expect that honeybees would
medicate their offspring through elevated levels of Glucose oxidase and Defensin-1 in the food? If yes, this would
maybe make a better introduction than social immune defence. If not, then I think that the authors should consider
the fact of context dependent induction of immune defences, i.e. larval infection vs. food contamination, to discuss
their findings.
The general idea in the literature is that GOX and other antimicrobial secretions are produced by workers as social
immune defenses (L64-67). This experiment aimed to determine if GOX and Def-1 are induced in nurse bees in
response to a colony-level pathogen challenge. We did not necessarily expect to find that these are inducible traits,
and in fact found that these are constitutive defenses at the colony level and do not change in response to
pathogen pressure (at least this bacterial pathogen). We have tried to clarify this point by expanding the rationale
behind hypotheses and predictions (L75-87).
Material and Methods
Experimental design:
It is not clear to me how the authors could collect 30 spores from an infected colony, but then have a final
concentration of 1.5X10^7 spores/ml. Did the authors use these initial spores to infect larvae from which they then
harvested more spores for infection? If yes, please say so.
The first mention of spores is incorrect. It should instead be 30 “scales” (e.g. the dried remains of larvae killed by
AFB infection that contains millions of spores).
Another point that is not clear to me, is why the authors infected each colony twice. Please explain the rational for
this.
We infected colonies twice with AFB to guarantee that colonies would effectively develop the disease. After one
week of infection, we observed few diseased cells. We therefore infected colonies again to assure that colonies
would show symptoms of disease. We have now explicitly stated this in lines 108-109.
Gene expression:
Please report the primers used or at least point to literature were they are described.
We have now done so and thank the reviewer for catching this unintended omission.
Statistical Analysis:
The fragment: “For the enzymatic GOX data, ‘date of the assay’”, is not clear for me.
In this version of the manuscript, we have expanded the ‘statistical analysis’ section, and have now clarified why we
include the variable ‘plate’ (we changed that from ‘date of the assay’) as a random effect.
Moreover, as colonies were repeatedly measured over time, I think that the authors, in addition to colony, also need
to include time in the random effects to account for this.
Time is one of the predictor variables since we are testing changes in enzymatic activity/expression of immune
factors before and after infection. We therefore cannot include time as a random effect. We also found statistical
approaches such as ‘repeated measures’ not to be suitable for our analyses since the individuals that we analyzed
were different every time.
Finally, it is not clear to me how the authors analysed levels of American foulbrood symptoms. What were the
dependent variables? Anyway, as control colonies never showed symptoms and the authors apparently do not
want to describe statistical differences in infection levels over time in the treated colonies, no statistic is needed in
my opinion.
The number of AFB scales (the remains of infected larvae) were counted on each frame for each colony as
reported. We had show statistical differences in infection over time in Table 1. We agree that it is not necessary to
add statistics to the AFB symptoms sentence. We have now removed those results.
Discussion:
Although the only significant effect in the study was a decrease in Glucose oxidase and Defensin-1 at timepoint T1
the authors marginalize this effect in the discussion by describing it as slight reduction (third sentence, first
paragraph). This is in my opinion wrong and I think the authors should either try to explain this effect (for example
they could argue that this effect might stem from a trade-off between different levels of immune defence, i.e. larval
protection against food protection; see also comment above on context dependent expression of immune defences)
or simply state that they do not know what caused this effect.
We agree with the reviewer. This result should not be marginalized because it was both significant and consistent
across both GOX and Def-1. We have now expanded our discussion of these findings (L177-180).
Also, I think the authors should refrain from describing results which they do not present in the result section. They
write in the fourth sentence, second paragraph that their data show an effect of colony on levels of Glucose
oxidase, but they never show this effect in the result section either graphically in Figure 2 or as a statistical
significant effect, which I agree would be difficult as colony was included as a random effect in the model and p-
values are difficult to associate with random-effects.
We have amended the text to reflect this and made it more of a point of follow-up and connection to previous work
rather than an explicit finding.
Table 1:
The table shows only 2 control colonies, but Material and Methods mentions 3 (first sentence under the header
Experimental design). Can you please explain why?
We also answered this question above. We started the experiment with 3 control colonies but one of them became
queenless and could no longer be used. We therefore only report results for the 2 remaining control colonies.
Figure 1:
I think that the authors should try to restrict themselves only to literature involving honeybees with a thorough
literature research. Currently, they miss a lot of literature from other social insects, which I agree would almost be
impossible to summarize (see for example Tragust 2016 for the current literature of only venom and Metapleural
gland secretions in ants as external immune defence)
We have expanded the citations included in this figure, while keeping it focused on honey bees.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_9
The authors have satisfactorily amended issues raised on a previous version of the manuscript.
Especially the final paragraph of the introduction has substantially improved. While I still do not agree
with some of the changes made by the authors (i.e. (1) exclusion of the definition of social immunity by
Cotter and Kilner 2010 (line 38-40), although this definition explicitly addresses actions performed for the
benefit of relatives, which is exactly what the authors look at in their manuscript and (2) describing
external immunity as one set of mechanisms of social immunity (line 50-52), although I tried to clarify in
the first version of the manuscript that external immune defence, as originally defined, includes immune
defence traits described under the concept of social immunity in social insects and not the other way
round), I believe that these disagreements lie within the ability of researchers to subjectively interpret
existing literature and should not hinder publication.
We did regretfully neglect to include Cotter and Kilner 2010 as a citation for the definition of social
immunity and have now added it. We have also added a line in the discussion to clarify the expanded
definition presented by Cotter and Kilner (L200). Because our focus is not on external vs. internal social
immunity per se, but on how externally secreted compounds are used as a social immune defense, we
chose to remove the phrase “external immunity” since the focus of the paper concerns the potential role
of antimicrobial secretions as an inducible mechanism of social immunity in social insects.
Line 75-77: Consider revising fragment “…, either from spores left behind in the cell from reuse or from
adult bees contaminated the brood food.”
We have now changed this sentence for: “Honey bee larvae become infected with AFB by the transfer of
spores via contaminated food, which come from spores left behind in reused cells or from adult bees
carrying them and then contaminating brood food.”
Line 142: Revise “Samples the showed…” to “Samples that showed…”
Done.
Line 143: Change “…outliers-.” to “…outliers.”
Done.
