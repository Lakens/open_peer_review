This is an interesting approach, perhaps limited by sample size. It should be emphasized that
comparisons with prior publication prevalence is complicated by the search image utilized. So,
absence of report of a certain type of pathology may simply represent its lack of interest (related
to the study subject).
All non-fracture pathology (including abscesses/infections, be they isolated or associated with
fractures) need to be illustrated and the few images are slightly out of focus or at least of
inadequate resolution.
This is especially important, as articular ankyloses can be infectious or part of an underlying
arthritis.
There is much self-citation, but the literature is more extensive and should be cited, especially
3
from primary references. There is more baseline data than is referenced. They cite Rothschild et
al. (2012)
A common error that we all are guilty of, myself included, is to use the term “frequency.”
Frequency relates to occurrence in a given time interval. The correct term is “prevalence.”
When statistical analysis is performed, the test should be revealed. Given the small numbers, I
suspect that Fisher exact test would be required. Chi square is not valid if 25% or more of
“boxes” have values of 5 or less. Beta (Type II error also needs to be reported) when no statistical
difference is recognized.

Appendix A
Dear Editor and Authors,
The manuscript I was sent to review is a brief review and innovative analysis of the
distribution of pathologies in marine reptiles. The authors review the occurrence of
pathologies (subdivided in different “types”) in ichthyosaurs from the well-sampled
Posidonia Shale and through documented environmental/faunal shifts.
I consider this a well-written and organised manuscript that would only require minor
changes before being ready for publication.
I particularly appreciated the hypothesis-driven approach and the impressive number of
specimens examined by the authors. These factors, combined with simple and well-
executed analyses contribute to a welcomed addition to our knowledge of marine reptile
ecosystems. However, in my opinion, the biggest merit of this study is that it provides a
powerful methodology that can be extended to other case study (e.g. other well-sampled
intervals/ecosystems). Finally, similar approaches can be adopted to test prey/predator
inferences and “feeding guilds” hypothesis in complex ecosystems. I believe that the
authors could add some remarks about these possibilities in the abstract and conclusion.
I would argue that some minor additional details and clarifications are still needed before
full acceptance. The majority of the suggested changes can be found in the attached PDF,
and I will use this letter to highlight broader and more general points.
Accordingly, while I found the text well written and organised but the authors could add
the following modifications to make it even clearer:
1) First of all the authors could spend some more words (one paragraph or two)
explaining in more detail the pathologies they are analysing and what could cause
them. This information, while not vital, would help clarifying which traumas can
be used as evidence of animal interactions/predation. Until reading the Methods it
was not clear what type of pathologies the authors were referring to (e.g. only bite
marks?). It may be also worth specifying earlier than the Discussion that not all
pathologies necessarily indicate a predator/prey interaction.
2) Clarifying some specialist terms and metrics (e.g. interaction term) would greatly
benefit the clarity of the text. These should be explained in the methods, perhaps
with reference of previous studies that have adopted similar techniques in support.
3) As previously mentioned the authors could use more effectively the Abstract to
respectively highlight the merits of this manuscript but also justify their chosen
methods and factors such as considered interval, decision of focusing on one
group only etc..
4) The authors should carefully double-check their in-text reference and figure
formatting. Multiple styles are currently adopted, including some odd and
unnecessary formatting for manuscript “(e.g., (40))”
Specifics on these individual points can be found in the attached PDF.
Figures
The figures are generally well designed, informative and consistent in style. I particularly
appreciated the use of figure 1 to illustrate different types of pathologies. The figures are
effectively referenced through the text (although there is some inconsistency in the
capitalisation of subfigures in the in-text references).
Here I suggest some minor modifications that would improve the readability of the
figures:
1) The text in figure 2 and 3 is really hard to read. Particularly the % and explanation
of the colour code. Additionally, it would be appropriate double-checking that the
colours in the figures are colour-blind friendly. The majority of figure-making
software offers an option to check whether the colour combination is appropriate.
Alternatively, the addition of a pattern on the graph bars would be sufficient.
2) I would personally enjoy a figure illustrating the partition of the skeletons adopted
by the authors. I realise this has been done in a previous manuscript, but I think
the text would benefit from it. Consider this as a suggestion though – I leave it to
the authors’ judgment deciding whether this extra figure (that could easily be
added at the bottom of figure 1) would be appropriate or not.
Given the minor nature of these modifications I do not think that the manuscript will
require an extra round of review. I look forward to see a final version of this manuscript,
and if appropriate for the journal policy I would be happy to be contacted privately by the
authors (davidefoffa@gmail.com or d.foffa@nms.ac.uk) for discussion and further
clarifications on my comments.

24 Abstract
25
26 Palaeoepidemiological studies related to palaeoecology are rare, especially among marine taxa.
27 Although such studies have the potential to provide information regarding ecosystem-level
28 characteristics by measuring individual health, baseline data are lacking. In order to assess factors
29 underlying the prevalence of pathologies in fossil marine reptiles, we surveyed ichthyosaurs from the
30
Posidonienschiefer Formation (Early Jurassic: Toarcian) of Southwestern Germany. We considered five
31
32 variables as potentially influencing the frequency of pathologies: taxon, anatomical region, body size,
33 ontogeny, and environmental change, as represented by the early Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event. We
34 found that the incidence of pathologies is dependent on taxon, with the small-bodied genus
35 Stenopterygius exhibiting fewer skeletal pathologies than all other taxa. Larger-bodied genera show a
36
37
higher incidence of pathology overall than smaller-bodied genera. Within Stenopterygius, we detected
38 more pathologies in large adults than in juveniles and small- mid-sized adults. Stratigraphic horizon did
39 not influence the incidence of pathologies in Stenopterygius, implying that palaeoenvironmental
40 changes did not have a major effect on metrics of skeletal health in this system. Quantification of the
41 occurrence of pathologies within taxa and across guilds is critical to constructing more detailed
42
43 hypotheses regarding changes in the frequency of skeletal injury and disease through Earth history.

1. Introduction
50
51 Palaeoepidemiological surveys have the potential to provide novel information on individual health,
52
as well as overarching metrics of ecosystem function such as predation pressure. Such surveys have
53
54
been attempted in numerous fossil systems (e.g., non-avian dinosaurs (1), and Pleistocene carnivorans
55 (2) and frogs (3)); however baseline data are largely lacking for ancient marine systems. Such data can
56 provide not only new information relevant to the palaeoecology of specific taxa, but can also shed light
57 on the relationship between the frequency of skeletal trauma/disease and life history, trophic level,
58 and environmental parameters. The possibility of surveying a relatively large sample of individuals
59 from a geologically and geographically restricted interval spanning a range of trophic levels and
60 ontogenetic stages makes ichthyosaurs from southwestern Germany an ideal system to provide
baseline data for this type of palaeoepidemiological survey.

3 Ichthyosaurs are a group of Mesozoic marine reptiles that occupied a broad range of trophic levels in
4 Early Jurassic pelagic ecosystems (4,5). The ichthyosaurian fossil record is controlled by lagerstätte-
5
type deposits, in which temporally and geographically restricted formations yield large numbers of
6
7
associated skeletons (6). An example of such is the Posidonienschiefer Formation, a classic konservat
8 lagerstätte yielding a rich assemblage of exceptionally preserved fossil vertebrates and invertebrates,
9 spanning a minor mass extinction associated with ecosystem-level changes in vertebrate and
10 invertebrate faunas (the early Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE): (7,8)). Ichthyosaurs are the most
11 abundant large vertebrates from this formation, and are represented in museum collections
12 worldwide by thousands of complete, articulated skeletons (9). Five ichthyosaur genera are known
13 from these deposits, varying in body size and trophic position: Hauffiopteryx (2.5 m long),
14 Stenopterygius (3.5 m long), Suevoleviathan (4 m long), Eurhinosaurus (7 m long), and the apex
15
predator Temnodontosaurus (>9 m long).
16
17
18 Previous studies on the distribution of pathologies in ichthyosaurs have suggested that the actual
19 frequency of skeletal trauma is much higher than reflected in the literature; however the anatomical
20 distribution of pathologies is accurately reflected in published reports (10)(11). These studies were
21 respectively based on a meta-analysis of published reports (10) and a detailed survey of pathologies
22 within a single genus (11). Factors affecting the overall incidence of osteopathologies have not been
23 quantified across taxa within a limited temporal and geographic scope. We examine the effect of body
24
size, ontogeny, and the T-OAE on the frequency and distribution of pathologies in ichthyosaurs from
25
26 the Early Jurassic Posidonienschiefer Formation of southwestern Germany in order to statistically
27 assess which factors affect the observed frequency of osteopathologies. We hypothesize that a) larger
28 taxa occupying higher trophic levels will exhibit a greater incidence of traumatic injuries caused by
29 intraspecific aggression; b) smaller taxa may exhibit frequent incidences of joint disease and avascular
30 necrosis, but overall will have fewer traumatic injuries, c) juveniles will exhibit the fewest pathological
31 skeletal modifications, due to more rapid healing or reduced survivorship following trauma. This
32 approach will provide a critical baseline for measuring changes in the frequency of osteopathologies
33
through time and across habitats in large marine vertebrates.

41 2. Materials and methods
42
43 To assess factors influencing the frequency of osteopathologies in ichthyosaurs, we surveyed 236
44
specimens from the Posidonienschiefer Formation housed in the SMNS, GPIT, UMH, and FWD
45
46 collections ((12)), and scored the presence/absence of pathologies. We divided the skeleton into five
47 anatomical regions following (10,13) to account for variation in skeletal completeness: skull, ribs and
48 gastralia, vertebral column, pectoral girdle and forefin, and pelvic girdle and hind fin. In addition, we
49 classified observed pathologies into three types following (10): trauma with evidence of healing,
50 articular disease and ankyloses.
51
52 We examined the influence of four variables (genus, size, ontogeny, and stratigraphic provenance) on
53
the presence and absence of pathologies. Generic body size was based on the categories used by (4)
54
55 small-medium (adults < 4 m long) versus large (adults = 4 m long). For the ontogenetic and stratigraphic
56 analyses, we considered only Stenopterygius due to large available sample size. We grouped
57 Stenopterygius into four size classes, based on estimated mandibular length: neonates and juveniles
58 (mandibular length estimated at < 40 cm), small adults (mandibular lengths between 40-50 cm), large
59 adults (mandibular lengths between 50-60 cm), and very large adults (mandibular lengths >60 cm).
60 None of the specimens in the largest size category are attributed to S. quadriscissus, as the largest
confirmed specimen of this species has a mandibular length of 56.4 cm in length (14), but includes
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos

2
3 individuals of both S. triscissus and S. uniter. For the stratigraphic analysis, we classified specimens into
4 three time intervals, based on the position of the invertebrate extinction horizon in the Southwest
5
German Basin (8,15): eI1-II3 (before the anoxic event), eII4-5 (beds which represent the most severe and
6
7
prolonged development of anoxic conditions in the basin (16)), and the upper part of the section (eII6-
8 III), representing a gradual return to normal marine conditions characterized by fluctuating benthic
9 oxygenation (16). For the taxonomic and ontogenetic analyses, we considered all surveyed specimens
10 and included anatomical region as a covariate to control for differences in completeness between taxa
11 and size classes (e.g., (17)). However, for the stratigraphic provenance analysis we considered only
12 specimens preserving >50% of the skeleton to eliminate anatomical region as a covariate, thus
13 maximizing statistical power. We analyzed the data using binomial logistic regression in the software
14 package R.

19
20 Types of pathologies observed
21
22 <U+F0B7> Stenopterygius
23
Seventeen of 171 specimens of Stenopterygius were pathological ((12): Table EMS1). Trauma was the
24
25 most frequent type of pathology in Stenopterygius, observed in thirteen cases, most often affecting
26 the ribs and gastralia (8/13) (Fig. 1 d, 2). In three specimens (PMU 24320, UMH/dc10, SMNS 9808),
27 injured ribs are associated with infection and abscesses. PMU 24320 also shows a traumatic injury with
28 abscesses related to an infection in the mandible (10). Three specimens of Stenopterygius show
29
30
pathologies in the pectoral girdle and forefin involving the ankylosis of limb elements (GPIT no. 83;
31 SMNS 56856; SMNS 50007: Fig. 1 A, B). Vertebral column pathologies have been observed in only two
32 specimens, both showing ankylosis of the neural spines (GPIT/RE/7301; PMU 24320).
33
34 <U+F0B7> Hauffiopteryx
35
36 Two of eight examined specimens exhibited pathologies (Fig. 2; (12): Table EMS1). SMNS 81367
37 showed a gastralium with a callus developed (Fig. 1c) and broken and healed centra in the posterior
38 vertebral column. SMNS 80226 showed three broken and healed gastralia, with signs of infection in
39 two of them.
40
41 <U+F0B7> Euhrinosaurus
42
43 Of 23 specimens of Euhrinosaurus surveyed, five were pathological (Fig. 2, (12), Table EMS1). The most
44 affected anatomical units were the ribs (two specimens) and pectoral girdle and forefin (two
45
46 specimens). Both of the latter specimens were affected by ankylosis between phalanges (11). No
47 pathologies were observed in the vertebral column or pelvic girdle/hind fin.
48
49 <U+F0B7> Temnodontosaurus
50
51 Of 27 specimens of Temnodontosaurus surveyed, eight were pathological (Fig. 2, (12): Table EMS1).
52 The most frequently affected anatomical unit is the skull, with bone fibre remodeling in the jaws
53 observed in five specimens. Ankyloses in the phalanges of the forefin were observed in two specimens.
54 No pathologies were observed in the vertebral column of Temnodontosaurus; pathologies in the pelvic
55
girdle/hind fin and ribs/gastralia were observed in only one specimen each. The specimen with the
56
57 pathological hindlimb also had ankyloses in the phalanges of the forefin (11).

3 Based on all specimens and taxa, the most affected anatomical region was the ribs with 8% (13/174)
4
showing pathologies, followed by the skull with 6% (12/203) and forelimb, in which 4% (7/186) were
5
6 pathological. The least frequently pathological anatomical regions were the vertebral column and hind
7 limb, with 2% (3/184) and 1% (2/154) of specimens affected.

10 Incidence of pathologies by taxon, size, ontogeny and stratigraphic level
11
12 <U+F0B7> Relative frequency of pathologies by taxon
13
14 We analysed the relative frequency pathologies between the genera, with anatomical region as a
15 covariate, omitting Suevoleviathan due to small available sample size. Both taxon and anatomical
16 region explained significant amounts of variation in the frequency of pathologies ((12): Table EMS1;
17 P<0.05), however no anatomical region was significantly more or less pathological than the others
18
(P>0.05 for all). The interaction term (taxon * anatomical region) was not significant, and so was
19
20 removed and the analysis re-run. Stenopterygius showed significantly (more than 2.9 times) fewer
21 pathologies than all other taxa (P=0.04).
22
23 <U+F0B7> Relative frequency of pathologies by body length
24
Logistic regression with taxon size as the independent variable and anatomical region as a covariate
25
26 indicated that large taxa were 2.4 times more likely to be pathological than small taxa ((12), Table
27 EMS2; P=0.02), suggesting that adult body size is a significant factor influencing the incidence of
28 pathologies in ichthyosaurs. However, because Hauffiopteryx is relatively rare, the large sample size of
29 Stenopterygius, which overall has significantly fewer pathologies than any other genus, may be
30
31
influencing this result. The interaction term (anatomical region * size) was omitted as it did not explain
32 substantially more of the variation in the sample.
33
34 <U+F0B7> Relative frequency of pathologies through ontogeny
35 We tested the frequency of pathologies in Stenopterygius across a range of size classes, a proxy for
36 ontogenetic age, with anatomical region as a covariate. Ontogeny significantly affected the frequency
37 of pathologies ((12), Table EMS3), with the largest adults more than four times as likely to be
38
pathological than juvenile specimens (P=0.008). Small- and mid-sized adults did not exhibit significantly
39
40 more frequent pathologies than juveniles (Fig. 3). Anatomical region was significantly informative as a
41 co-variate, but no one region was significantly more likely to be pathological than any other.
42
43 <U+F0B7> Relative frequency of pathologies over geological time
44 For this analysis, only Stenopterygius specimens with skeletal completeness greater than 50% were
45 considered. 14% (7/50) of pathological specimens were recovered in the beds underlying the carbon
46
isotopic excursion marking the onset of oceanic anoxia (beds eI1-II3), 12.5% (3/24) were from the period
47
48 of peak anoxia (beds eII4-II5), and 6.5% (2/31) were from the overlying horizons eII6-III. Logistic
49 regression did not recover significant differences in the frequency of pathologies between horizons
50 ((12), Table EMS4), indicating that ecological change is not a major factor influencing the incidence of
51 pathologies in this genus.
52

55 4 Discussion
56
57 Large numbers of previously unreported pathologies were observed in all taxa (Fig. 1; (12)).
58 Systematic data collection indicates that there is much less disparity observed in the distribution of
59 pathologies between anatomical regions than typically reported in the literature (10). However, the
60
low incidence of pathologies in the vertebral column in ichthyosaurs from the Posidonia Shale is
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos

1
2
3 consistent with other studies. This pattern is divergent from other large secondarily aquatic reptiles
4
and mammals relying on axial propulsion, namely mosasaurid squamates and cetaceans, in which
5
6 pathologies in the vertebral column are abundant (18–24). Traumatic injuries dominate the observed
7 pathologies in ichthyosaurs from the Posidonienschiefer Formation, consistent with (11) but again
8 differing from the broader literature (10). Our failure to detect avascular necrosis in this survey is
9 notable, as this pathology is prevalent in ichthyosaurs from the older Blue Lias and younger Oxford
10
Clay Formations (25,26). Its apparent absence in the Posidonienschiefer Formation may be attributed
11
12 to the difficulty in identifying subsidence structures in strongly compressed slab-mounted specimens,
13 or may reflect the absence of deep-diving behaviours in this ecosystem.
14
15 The frequency of skeletal injuries is known to differ between predators with distinct hunting
16 strategies (2). Stenopterygius exhibited significantly fewer osteopathologies than the other genera in
17 our survey (contra (10)), indicating either a lower-risk hunting strategy consistent with a diet of
18 relatively small prey (e.g., (27)), or fewer aggressive interactions with conspecifics. However, the high
19
20
frequency of pathologies in the largest adults suggests a third possibility, namely that the
21 Stenopterygius sample is on average ontogenetically younger than that of the other genera; in other
22 words had fewer years over which to accumulate traumatic damage to the skeleton. In support of the
23 latter hypothesis, the frequency of cranial pathologies in Stenopterygius increases sharply from 2% in
24 juveniles and small adults to 10% in specimens with mandibular lengths greater than 50 cm (Fig. 3).
25
26 Hunting-related injuries are well-documented among both marine and terrestrial vertebrate
27
predators (28) and are predicted to be more frequent and severe among larger-bodied predators,
28
29 which pursue proportionately larger prey (29). However, non-fatal predator-induced injuries are also
30 common and their incidence is affected by a range of factors, including predation rate, predator
31 inefficiency, age structure of the prey population, and survivorship of injured individuals (30–33).
32 Injuries incurred during intraspecific conflict are also likely: for instance, skeletal injury to the ribs
33
(19,34) and jaws (34) of odontocete cetaceans are attributed to aggressive interactions with
34
35 conspecifics. Mid-level consumers (Stenopterygius, Hauffiopteryx) differed from the larger taxa
36 (Eurhinosaurus, Suevoleviathan, Temnodontosaurus) in the number, but not skeletal distribution, of
37 observed pathologies, with traumas being the most commonly observed pathologies in both size
38 classes. Consistent with terrestrial taxa, large body size does not appear to confer protection from
39
40
skeletal trauma in ichthyosaurs, and in fact the reverse appears probable, suggesting that failed
41 predation attempts account for a relatively low proportion of total observed injuries.
42
43 In extant vertebrates, the observed frequency of skeletal pathologies increases with ontogenetic
44 age ((2) and references therein; (33,35)). Consistent with the literature for other vertebrates, in
45 Stenopterygius more pathologies were observed in the largest-bodied adults than in juveniles, small,
46 and mid-sized adults (Fig. 3). There are several potential underlying causes for this distribution.
47
Osteologically immature individuals may have experienced more rapid healing, resulting in a smaller
48
49 number of macroscopically visible pathologies (36,37). Alternatively, small individuals may have
50 experienced reduced survivorship following injury. However, large adults may show more skeletal
51 pathologies than smaller individuals for another reason: whereas very large adults do not show
52 substantially more frequent traumatic injuries than other size classes, they do exhibit an increased
53
prevalence of articular disease and ankylosis in the forelimb, hind limb, and vertebral column. These
54
55 types of osteopathologies are typically associated with aging.
56
57 The Posidonienschiefer Formation spans the early Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event, a minor mass
58 extinction affecting primarily invertebrates (7), but also influencing ichthyosaur diversity and inter-
59 and intraspecific body size (8). We found no significant differences in the prevalence of skeletal
60 pathologies in Stenopterygius immediately before, at the peak of, and during the recovery phase
following the anoxic event. The prevalence of pathologies is slightly, but not significantly, reduced

2
3 (6.5% vs. 12.5%) towards the top of the section ((12), Table EMS4). This suggests that in this case,
4
environmental stress is not related either to more frequent illness or injury (expected increase in the
5
6 prevalence of pathologies) or reduced survivorship following illness or injury (expected decrease in
7 the prevalence of pathologies).

11 5 Conclusion
12
13 The appeal of palaeopathology is in its ability to create a dramatic picture of prehistoric animals
14 interacting millions of years ago. However, the risk of over-interpreting isolated data points as
15
providing information on usual behaviour for a taxon remains high. Most previous studies in marine
16
17 reptiles, with the exception of those examining the prevalence of avascular necrosis (e.g., (25,38,39),
18 have been generally anecdotal in nature, reporting only the description of a specific pathology in one
19 or two specimens (e.g., (40)) or suite of pathologies in a single specimen (e.g., (41)). Our study provides
20 the first detailed and systematic analysis of the prevalence of pathologies in a Mesozoic marine system,
21
and provides comparative baseline data for the frequency of pathologies in ichthyosaurs and, more
22
23 generally, Mesozoic marine reptiles occupying mid- to high trophic levels.
24 Of the palaeoecological variables analyzed (genus, adult body size, ontogeny, and environmental
25 stress), genus, adult body size, and ontogeny significantly affected the number of pathologies
26 detected. Thus, ichthyosaurs appear to be similar to extant vertebrates in which pathologies
27
accumulate in the oldest/largest members of a population, and larger taxa experience proportionately
28
29 more frequent skeletal traumas. Extending this baseline survey across taxa and geological time periods
30 will allow broader evolutionary and ecological concepts to be explicitly tested in a
31 palaeoepidemiological framework.

Appendix C
Reviewer’s response
Reviewer 1
1) First of all the authors could spend some more words (one paragraph or two)
explaining in more detail the pathologies they are analyzing and what could cause
them. This information, while not vital, would help clarifying which traumas can be
used as evidence of animal interactions/predation. Until reading the Methods it was
not clear what type of pathologies the authors were referring to (e.g. only bite
marks?). It may be also worth specifying earlier than the Discussion that not all
pathologies necessarily indicate a predator/prey interaction.
Author: explanations to each suggested sections were included.
2) Clarifying some specialist terms and metrics (e.g. interaction term) would greatly
benefit the clarity of the text. These should be explained in the methods, perhaps with
reference of previous studies that have adopted similar techniques in support.
Author: explanation was included.
3) As previously mentioned the authors could use more effectively the Abstract to
respectively highlight the merits of this manuscript but also justify their chosen methods
and factors such as considered interval, decision of focusing on one group only etc..
Author: a more detailed explanation was included to the abstract
4) The authors should carefully double-check their in-text reference and figure formatting.
Multiple styles are currently adopted, including some odd and unnecessary formatting
for manuscript “(e.g., (40))”
Author: the mistakes were corrected.
5) Specifics on these individual points can be found in the attached PDF.
Author: We included the corrected version of the manuscript with track changes,
following each of the suggested corrections of reviewers.
6) The text in figure 2 and 3 is really hard to read. Particularly the % and explanation of
the colour code. Additionally, it would be appropriate double-checking that the colours
in the figures are colour-blind friendly. The majority of figure-making software offers an
option to check whether the colour combination is appropriate. Alternatively, the
addition of a pattern on the graph bars would be sufficient.
Author: The size of the text in the figures was increased according to the reviewer
observation. The colors used in the graphics are color-blind friendly.
7) I would personally enjoy a figure illustrating the partition of the skeletons adopted by
the authors. I realise this has been done in a previous manuscript, but I think the text
would benefit from it. Consider this as a suggestion though – I leave it to the authors’
judgment deciding whether this extra figure (that could easily be added at the bottom
of figure 1) would be appropriate or not.
Author: We appreciate the reviewer suggestion but this has figured previously by
Beardmore and Furrer (2016) (mentioned within the manuscript) and our classification
is described using fairly self-evident descriptive labels (e.g., 'skull', ‘vertebral column’
etc.), making a figure unnecessary.
Reviewer 2
1) All non-fracture pathology (including abscesses/infections, be they isolated or
associated with fractures) need to be illustrated and the few images are slightly out of
focus or at least of inadequate resolution.
Author: The images selected in Figure 1 are of the best resolution that we were able
to get, given the poor light conditions in mounted skeleton and depositories. Most of
the material is polished by mechanical preparation because they correspond to old
collections prepared with old techniques, therefore the nature of ankyloses in the cases
of Posidonia shale cannot be determinate. More detailed figures of each pathology was
published in Pardo-Pérez et al., (2018b), this publication is cited in the text.
2) There is much self-citation, but the literature is more extensive and should be cited,
especially from primary references. There is more baseline data than is referenced.
They cite Rothschild et al. (2012)
Author: We included more references according to the reviewer observation.
3) A common error that we all are guilty of, myself included, is to use the term
“frequency.” Frequency relates to occurrence in a given time interval. The correct term
is “prevalence.”
Author: We corrected the mistake according to the reviewer observation.
4) When statistical analysis is performed, the test should be revealed. Given the small
numbers, I suspect that Fisher exact test would be required. Chi square is not valid if
25% or more of “boxes” have values of 5 or less. Beta (Type II error also needs to be
reported) when no statistical difference is recognized.
Author: The complete results of the statistical analysis was included.
