label_comment_1
The authors stated that they investigated plasma metabolite changes during lung carcinoma
progression in mouse model using UPLC-QTOF/MS. However, metabolic alterations during
lung carcinoma development should be more suitable for the tile and contents, as only two time
points (7 and 14 DPI) were explored and there were lack of staging information, as progression is
more related to pathologic stages. In addition, the results did not support the conclusion well, as
there is no evidence in the results to show the biomarkers potential for monitoring cancer
diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic efficacy. Possibly, some potential for diagnosis, but needs
to be verified in clinical trials.
Other comments:
1, E represent collision energy should be “represents”.
2, Table 1 and Figure S1 are duplicate. The sarcoma pictures of 7 and 14 DPI are recommended to
be shown in Figure S1.
3, In table 2 and in the text, please add a note for the AUC values, whether it from the
comparisons between 7 DPI and control, or between 14 DPI and controls.
4, Figure 1 contains less valuable information, can be moved to the supplementary. In contrast,
Figure S1 can be moved into the main text.
5, Figure 2c, QC samples in negative model is not well grouped, which means the data quality is
not well reliable. Please explain?
6, in section 3.5, the paragraph is about metabolic variations between 7 and 14 DPI, but some
figures indicated are not related to this topic such as figure 3, as below.
As the sarcoma grows, 14 and 12 differential metabolites were screened in positive and negative-
ion mode between 7 DPI and 14 DPI group, respectively. The scores plots of OPLSDA model
discriminated the 14 DPI group from 7 DPI group in positive (Figure 3A and 3D) and negative
ion mode (Figure S2 A and D), which shown satisfactory classification, implying that the
differential metabolites contributed to the good separation. The differential metabolites were
visualized and filtered by the S-plots (Figure 3 B,E and Figure S2 B,E) and loading-plots (Figure 3
C,F and Figure S2 C,F) in both ion modes, respectively. The heat maps also shown that the
plasma metabolic states of 14 DPI group mice deviated significantly from 7 DPI in the positive
(Figure 4B) and negative-ion mode (Figure 4D), respectively.

Untargeted metabolomics profiles delineate metabolic alterations
in mouse plasma during lung carcinoma progression using UPLCQTOF/MS in MSE mode
Overall this is a very interesting bit of work with a lot of analysis conducted. I have five main
concerns which should be addressed.
1] The English is not suitable for publication and would need a thorough re-write. (it is not
incomprehensible but needs improvement)
2] There is no real explanation of the use of the Lewis Lung cancer carcinoma model. Why was
this one selected. What is the effect of a xenograft model - could this not be the reason for changes
in remodelling type metabolites. What was the control???
3] How was the LC-MS analysis done. Were the samples sequentially run through the groups or
was it randomised?? If not randomised how do you account for any "drift" throughout the
sample set??
4] The negative ion data nicely clusters. Why does the positive ion not do the same?
5] You don't really show convincingly the changes in metabolites from control to 7day to 14 day.
A line chart could have done this rather then HC??
Minor issues

Line 53 sentence “Up to date…. ” needs rewriting

Response to Reviewer #1:
Comment: 1) “Metabolic alterations during lung carcinoma development
should be more suitable for the tile and contents, as only two time points (7 and
14 DPI) were explored and there were lack of staging information, as
progression is more related to pathologic stages.”
Answer: Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We have checked the
manuscript carefully and corrected “progression” to “development” in the title,
abstract and text. The amendments are highlighted in red in the marked-up
manuscript.
Comment: 2) “In addition, the results did not support the conclusion well, as
there is no evidence in the results to show the biomarkers potential for
monitoring cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic efficacy. Possibly, some
potential for diagnosis, but needs to be verified in clinical trials.”
Answer: Thank you for your comment. We have deleted the sentence “It was
demonstrated that the untargeted metabonomics method based on
UPLC-QTOF/MS in MSE mode was a feasible approach for providing endogenous
biomarkers to monitor cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic efficacy” in
the abstract, and modified the sentence “Collectively, the present study
delineates distinct metabolic perturbations linked to onset and progresses of
lung carcinoma which may elucidate possible biological mechanisms of the
disease and provide endogenous biomarkers for monitoring cancer diagnosis,
prognosis and therapeutic efficacy” to “Collectively, the present study
delineates distinct metabolic perturbations linked to onset and development of
lung carcinoma which may elucidate possible biological mechanisms of the
disease” in the conclusion.
Comment: 3) “E represent collision energy should be “represents”.”
Answer: Thank you for your suggestion. “E represent collision energy” has been
modified to “E represents collision energy” in the manuscript.
Comment: 4) “Table 1 and Figure S1 are duplicate. The sarcoma pictures of 7
and 14 DPI are recommended to be shown in Figure S1.”
Answer: Thank you for your suggestion. “Table 1” was deleted and “Table 2” has
been modified to “Table 1”. The sentence of “The sarcoma weights and volumes
of control, 7 DPI and 14 DPI group are shown in Table 1 and Figure S1.” has been
modified to “The sarcoma weights and volumes of control, 7 DPI and 14 DPI
group are shown in Figure 1.” in the manuscript.
Comment: 5) “In table 2 and in the text, please add a note for the AUC values,
whether it from the comparisons between 7 DPI and control, or between 14 DPI
and controls.”
Answer: Thank you for your valuable suggestion. As shown in Table 2 (Now, it
was Table 1), 9 dysregulated metabolites under positive-ion mode and 7
dysregulated metabolites under negative-ion mode were detected at all the two
time points. Notes have been added to AUC values, log2(FC) values, and P
values in Table 2 and in the text. The note (*) indicates the comparisons
between 7 DPI and control group.
“* indicates the comparisons between 7 DPI and control group” has been added
in Table 1.
Comment: 6) “Figure 1 contains less valuable information, can be moved to
the supplementary. In contrast, Figure S1 can be moved into the main text.”
Answer: Thank you for your suggestion. Figure 1 (representative UPLC-QTOF/MS
total ion chromatograms) was moved to the supplementary. In contrast, Figure
S1 (the sarcoma pictures of 7 and 14 DPI) has been moved into the main text.
The corresponding amendments are highlighted in red in the marked-up
manuscript.
Comment: 7) “Figure 2c, QC samples in negative model is not well grouped,
which means the data quality is not well reliable. Please explain?”
Answer: Thank you for your comment. Retention time (tR)-m/z datasets were
used to characterization of the detected ions. We reprocessed the intensities of
the detected ions according to “30% rule in QCP samples” and “80% rule in test
samples”. Then, we redrew the PCA score plots and Hotelling’s T2 Range plots of
all analyzed samples in 7 DPI model group, 14 DPI model group, control group
and QCP samples using EZinfo software.
“80% rule in test samples”: only the variables with values above zero in at least
80% of a group were kept for the following analysis.
“30% rule in QCP samples”: the ion intensities for each detected peak were
normalized against the sum of the peak intensities within that sample. After
normalization, variables with an RSD >30% in QCP samples were removed.
Comment: 8) “in section 3.5, the paragraph is about metabolic variations
between 7 and 14 DPI, but some figures indicated are not related to this topic
such as figure 3, as below.”
As the sarcoma grows, 14 and 12 differential metabolites were screened in
positive and negative-ion mode between 7 DPI and 14 DPI group, respectively.
The scores plots of OPLSDA model discriminated the 14 DPI group from 7 DPI
group in positive (Figure 3A and 3D) and negative ion mode (Figure S2 A and D),
which shown satisfactory classification, implying that the differential
metabolites contributed to the good separation. The differential metabolites
were visualized and filtered by the S-plots (Figure 3 B,E and Figure S2 B,E) and
loading-plots (Figure 3 C,F and Figure S2 C,F) in both ion modes, respectively.
The heat maps also shown that the plasma metabolic states of 14 DPI group
mice deviated significantly from 7 DPI in the positive (Figure 4B) and
negative-ion mode (Figure 4D), respectively.
Answer: Thank you for your valuable suggestion. In section 3.5, the paragraph is
about metabolic variations between 7 and 14 DPI, but some figures indicated
are not related to this topic such as figure 3. Figure 3 showed that the variations
between 7 DPI and control group. Figure S2 showed that the variations between
14 DPI and 7 DPI.
The paragraph in section 3.5 has been modified to “As the sarcoma grew, 14 and
12 differential metabolites were screened in positive and negative-ion mode
between 7 DPI and 14 DPI group, respectively. The scores plots of OPLSDA
model discriminated the 14 DPI group from 7 DPI group in positive (Figure S2 A)
and negative ion mode (Figure S2 D), which shown satisfactory classification,
implying that the differential metabolites contributed to the good separation.
The differential metabolites were visualized and filtered by the S-plots (Figure
S2 B, E) and loading-plots (Figure S2 C, F) in both ion modes, respectively. The
heat maps also shown that the plasma metabolic states of 14 DPI group mice
deviated significantly from 7 DPI in the positive (Figure 4B) and negative-ion
mode (Figure 4D), respectively.”
Response to Reviewer #2:
Overall this is a very interesting bit of work with a lot of analysis conducted. I
have five main concerns which should be addressed.
Comment: 1) “The English is not suitable for publication and would need a
thorough re-write. (it is not incomprehensible but needs improvement).”
Answer: Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We have checked the
manuscript carefully and seeked advice from a language polishing service
(https://secure.aje.com).The amendments are highlighted in red in the
marked-up manuscript.
Comment: 2) “There is no real explanation of the use of the Lewis Lung cancer
carcinoma model. Why was this one selected. What is the effect of a xenograft
model - could this not be the reason for changes in remodelling type
metabolites. What was the control???”
Answer: Thank you for your question. This untargeted metabolomics
investigation of lung carcinoma onset and development was conducted in a
tumor-bearing mouse model using Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell injection. As
a classic experimental animal model of lung carcinoma, LLC tumor-bearing
mouse model can reproduce some of the histogenesis and histological
morphology observed in lung carcinoma, and has been used in lung cancer
experiments [1-4]. So the Lewis Lung cancer carcinoma model was selected.
The xenograft model was the tumor-bearing mouse model. It could be the
reason for changes in remodelling type metabolites. The control was normal
C57BL/6 mouse.

Comment: 3) “How was the LC-MS analysis done. Were the samples
sequentially run through the groups or was it randomised?? If not randomised
how do you account for any "drift" throughout the sample set??”
Answer: Thank you for your comment. Each of the samples was analyzed by
UPLC-QTOF/MS in both positive and negative ionization mode to obtain
metabolite profiles and the analysis order of all test samples was randomized.
The analysis order of all test samples was randomized to reduce the impact of
"drift" on data.
In order to condition the LC-MS system, the QCP sample was injected three
times before initiating the run. The QCP sample was re-injected once at the
beginning, every five sample injections, and at the end of the run (total of nine
injections) to provide a set of data to monitor the reproducibility of the
analytical platform.
Comment: 4) “The negative ion data nicely clusters. Why does the positive ion
not do the same?”
Answer: Thank you for your question. We reprocessed the intensities of the
detected ions according to “30% rule in QCP samples” and “80% rule in test
samples”. Then, we redrew the PCA score plots and Hotelling’s T2 Range plots of
all analyzed samples in 7 DPI model group, 14 DPI model group, control group
and QCP samples using EZinfo software.
“80% rule in test samples”: only the variables with values above zero in at least
80% of a group were kept for the following analysis.
“30% rule in QCP samples”: the ion intensities for each detected peak were
normalized against the sum of the peak intensities within that sample. After
normalization, variables with an RSD >30% in QCP samples were removed.
Comment: 5) “You don't really show convincingly the changes in metabolites
from control to 7 day to 14 day. A line chart could have done this rather then
HC??”
Answer: Thank you for your valuable suggestion. The changes in metabolites
from control to 7 day to 14 day have been showed in Figure S3. Figure S3 was
added in Electronic Supplementary Text.
The sentence of “The intensity differences of 15 potential biomarkers were
evaluated by ‘One Way ANOVA’. All pairwise multiple comparison procedures
(Student–Newman–Keuls Method) were performed with a SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc.,
USA) to calculate the p-values among the control, 7 DPI and 14 DPI groups as
shown in Figure S3” had been added in Page 5.
Minor issues:
pg1 line 25 – word reliable
In line 1 of the abstract, “a reliable untargeted metabolomic method” has been
modified to “an untargeted metabolomic method”.
line 26 (E represents collision energy)?? DIA?
In this study, we describe a new application of ultra-performance liquid
chromatography coupled with an electrospray ionization quadrupole
time-of-flight mass spectrometry operating in MSE mode (UPLC-QTOF-MSE) for
the sensitive, fast, and effective characterization of endogenous metabolites in
mouse plasma. This approach allowed identification of endogenous metabolites
using a cyclic low and high collision energy spectral acquisition mode providing
simultaneous accurate precursor and fragment ion mass information.
The UPLC-QTOF-MSE chromatography of the mixture of endogenous
metabolites generates two different chromatograms, corresponding to each
scan function. In function 1, the quadrupole Q1 scans m/z 50-1200 transmitting
intact ions through the collision cell using low collision energy (6 V). These ions
are then pushed into the TOF analyzer to acquire exact mass measurements of
precursor ions. Interleaved with function 1, function 2 scans the same mass
range, but the collision cell dynamically applies high collision energy (15–40 V),
to optimally fragment all the ions transmitted by Q1 and precise mass
measurements of the fragments are subsequently acquired by the TOF analyzer.
Line 53 sentence “Up to date…. ” needs rewriting
In line 9 of the first paragraph, the sentence of “Up to date, the diagnosis is
mainly depends on the clinical symptoms and detection frequently occurred at
an advanced stage, thus lead to a very poor prognosis.” has been modified to
“Currently, diagnosis is mainly depends on the clinical symptoms, and detection
frequently occurs at an advanced stage, thus leading to a very poor prognosis.”.
Page 3 line 3 2nd column Lording to be replaced with loadings
“lording” has been modified to “loadings” in the manuscript.
Page 4 line 3 2nd column. Matrixes should be matrices
“matrixes” has been modified to “matrices” in Page 2, Page 4, Page 7.
Could you clarify if you ran the samples in sequence with intermittent QCs or
you randomised the samples?
The analysis order of all test samples was randomized to reduce the impact of
"drift" on data. The QCP sample was injected three times before initiating the
run. The QCP sample was re-injected once at the beginning, every five sample
injections, and at the end of the run (total of nine injections) to provide a set of
data to monitor the reproducibility of the analytical platform.
Figure 3 legend “Lording” error (x2) again
“lording” has been modified to “loadings” in legend of Figure 3.
Figure 4 How are the HC figures generated??
Heat maps were used to visualize the tendency of metabolite changes. The
intensities of the differential metabolites were exported into MeV_4.9.0
software to generate Heat maps.
Figure 6 legend matabolites should be metabolites
“matabolites” has been modified to “metabolites” in legend of Figure 6.
Thank you very much for your comments and suggestions once again!
Yours sincerely,
