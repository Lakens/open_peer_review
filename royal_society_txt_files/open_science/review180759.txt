In this manuscript by Zhu et al. the authors have used high resolution UPLC-MS to study the in
vitro metabolism of paeoniflorin in rat hepatic microsomes, which yielded 20 possible
metabolites for paeoniflorin, of which tentative structural elucidation were carried out for 6
metabolites based on the corresponding MS/MS data.
The work is suitable for RSOS, however, I have several major concerns with the manuscript that
need to be addressed.
1. I don’t quite understand the rationale for the study provided. Based on previous reports, the
authors say the following about paeoniflorin transformation: “…paeoniflorin could hardly be
metabolized in the gut wall, liver and lung, and its transformation in the intestinal led to
extremely the low bioavailability. As a consequence, few metabolism studies on paeoniflorin in
vitro especially in liver microsomes have been reported recently.” – if the parent drug is
transformed/metabolized in the intestine resulting in poor bioavailability, what’s the point in
studying corresponding hepatic metabolism, particularly in an in vitro setting? Also, while not
reported ‘recently’, are the authors aware of older studies on the subject?
2. Related to the above, the authors state “Furthermore, according to the scholar Hattori’s and our
research group’s researches, paeoniflorin could be hydrolyzed, oxidated and reduced in human
intestinal microflora (HIM). Therefore, paeoniflorin might have the same metabolic reactions in
the liver.” – why do the authors assume this connection outright?
3. The linearity for paeoniflorin for the HPLC-DAD is not even across a single order of
magnitude. From Figure 3, it doesn't look like the authors made an effort to test beyond this
narrow range.
4. When talking about regression, it should be R-squared.
5. The figure legends need to be expanded to provide context, nature of experimental data,
explaining the samples/controls, etc. across the board.
6. It is not clear why the mass spec has been operated in negative ionization mode only. The
structure of the parent compound and metabolites do not suggest better ionization in negative
mode - instead, empirically, it seems positive mode could be better - can the authors provide
rationale/experimental data to support the use of ESI- in this paper?
7. In most cases HRMS and MS/MS with subsequent computational analyses have been used to
assign full chemical structures to the metabolites. This is not ideal - unless compared against
authentic synthetic standards, or additional NMR-based analyses conducted, such assignments
are tentative at best and should be clearly indicated.
8. “This study explored the metabolism of paeoniflorin in vitro by rat liver microsomes, and 20
3
metabolites of paeoniflorin were found, in which 6 metabolites of paeoniflorin (including four
new metabolites) were identified.” - It is not clear what happened to the remaining 14
metabolites. Please clarify. It would be better to provide more details on them, e.g. tentative
molecular formula, etc. in table 2.
9. M3 trace shows a second peak - did the authors investigate this?
10. I would suggest that prior to resubmission, the authors consider seeking the assistance of a
professional editing service to work on the language and grammar-related issues of the
manuscript, which are too numerous to list here.

Several studies exist on the metabolism of paeoniflorin in many model systems including the in
the rat liver microsomes (https://doi.org/10.1002/bmc.3751). The manuscript by Linjun Zhu et
al. describes the an assay to measure bioconversion of paeoniflorin in vitro. While the
manuscript is detailed and describes the scientific aspects well, this reviewer has a few concerns,
which are enlisted below:
1. It is very interesting to see that paeoniflorin does not get hydrolyzed at the ester linkage. This is
especially surprising, given that the authors are working with rat liver microsomes. These
microsomes should have abundant esterases (like CES1, CES2, CES3), which would result in the
hydrolysis reaction. Can the authors provide this reviewer with the following details?
(a) Are the levels of these CES enzymes low in mirosomes that they do not see hydrolysis at the
ester linkage? Based on previous reports (Arch Biochem Biophys. 2012 Jun 1; 522(1): 44–56), the
expression of CES1 is close to 60ug/mg of microsomal fraction. This high amount would result in
hydrolysis at the ester linkage. Why do the authors not see this product?
(b) Secondly, this reviewer would be interested in seeing co-incubation of paeoniflorin with
commercially available CES1/2/3 and would like the authors to show if paeoniflorin is
hydrolyzed with CES1/2/3.
2. The manuscript is riddled with several typographical, grammatical and sentence construction
errors. This reviewer suggests the use of a professional scientific writer to improve the writing of
the manuscript. This is improve its readability and ultimately the impact on readers of the
manuscript and the journal.
3. In the introduction (last paragraph), the authors state that HRMS is a recent technique for
metabolite identification. This reviewer disagrees. HRMS for metabolite identification is no
longer a recent technique and has been around since the turn of the century.
4. Experimental section:
(a) Please provide catalog numbers of all reagents used.
(b) Section on preparation of liver microsomes – the authors mention the use of phenobarbital
sodium in rats at 60mg/kg. Please provide a rationale for this.
5
(c) Section on microsomal incubation conditions and preparation of sample – How were the
microsomes inactivated? Please provide details.
5. Results and Discussion section:
(a) Metabolites Identification – The authors mention the use of software and database they
developed in-house for the purpose. Has this been published before? Is it available to the wider
scientific community?
6. Figure 6: Please show structures of the various metabolites that correspond to each MS

Reviewers' comments and responses
Response to RSC Associate Editor:
The referees have expressed some enthusiasm with this work, but
have recommended significant revisions should be made. In particular
the authors should strengthen their message on the rationale behind the
work, address the comment about ester hydrolysis, and revise the
entire manuscript for grammar and readability.
Answer: We would like to thank the editor and reviewers for their
helpful comments regarding our manuscript. Detailed responses to
each of the points raised are given below. Based on the suggestions
made by reviewers and editor, we tried our best to strengthen our
message on the rationale in the revised manuscript. Meanwhile, we
have explained the comment about hydrolysis at the ester linkage in
response to reviewer #3. Regarding the language and grammar-related
issues, the manuscript has been revised according to your comments
by a professional editing service, and we have endeavored to correct
all the improper syntax of sentences in manuscript.
Response to reviewer #1:
1. I don’t quite understand the rationale for the study provided.
Based on previous reports, the authors say the following about
paeoniflorin transformation: “…paeoniflorin could hardly be
metabolized in the gut wall, liver and lung, and its transformation in
the intestinal led to extremely the low bioavailability. As a
consequence, few metabolism studies on paeoniflorin in vitro
especially in liver microsomes have been reported recently.” – if the
parent drug is transformed/ metabolized in the intestine resulting in
poor bioavailability, what’s the point in studying corresponding
hepatic metabolism, particularly in an in vitro setting? Also, while not
reported ‘recently’, are the authors aware of older studies on the
subject?
Answer: We appreciate the question made by the reviewer about
the significance of studying the corresponding hepatic metabolism in
vitro. First, based on the scholar Hattori’s1 and our research group’s
researches2 about the biotransformation of paeoniflorin in human
intestinal microflora, most of paeoniflorin is metabolized by intestinal
microflora. However, there is still some paeoniflorin absorbed and
metabolized in the liver. In order to explore metabolism mechanism of
paeoniflorin in the liver and further understand the complete
metabolism process of paeoniflorin in vivo, this research is a
complementary study for the metabolism process of paeoniflorin.
Second, there are a lot of advantages in the hepatic metabolism of
paeoniflorin in vitro such as the easy controlment of the amount of
paeoniflorin and conditions of biotransformation and a mature
metabolic model based on some previous studies3.
As for "reported recently", few studies on metabolites of
paeoniflorin in vitro especially in liver microsomes have been reported.
We have already corrected marked red in line 61-62 in revised
manuscript.
2. Related to the above, the authors state “Furthermore, according
to the scholar Hattori’s and our research group’s researches,
paeoniflorin could be hydrolyzed, oxidated and reduced in human
intestinal microflora (HIM). Therefore, paeoniflorin might have the
same metabolic reactions in the liver.” – why do the authors assume
this connection outright?
Answer: We apologize for the confusion and the explanation was
given as follow. As we know, a vast array of microbe species called
intestinal microflora live in intestinal tract. They could produce a
variety of enzymes such as hydrolase, oxidoreductase and transferase
in the process of growth and reproduction4. Similarly, the liver also has
a large number and high abundance of drug-metabolizing enzymes
especially Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) which could catalyze some
reactions like hydrolysis, oxidation and conjunction on substrates in
the liver5,6. Based on our previous study2, paeoniflorin was hydrolyzed,
oxidized and conjugated with polar groups in human intestinal
microflora (HIM), we have speculated that paeoniflorin would have
similar metabolic reactions in the liver. In addition, we had some
supplements to explain this question marked red in line 63-68 in the
revised manuscript.
3. The linearity for paeoniflorin for the HPLC-DAD is not even
across a single order of magnitude. From Figure 3, it doesn't look like
the authors made an effort to test beyond this narrow range.
Answer: We appreciate the suggestion made by the reviewer. On
the one hand, the calibration curve of paeoniflorin was constructed by
plotting the peak areas of paeoniflorin standard solutions against the
nominal concentration of paeoniflorin. The concentrations of
paeoniflorin remained in rat liver microsomes were determined by the
calibration curve. The linearity range of calibration curve covering the
peak areas of transformed paeoniflorin was adequate enough for this
experiment. On the other hand, by optimizing incubation conditions of
the NADPH-generating system, we found that the conversion rate of
paeoniflorin was very low which was in accordance with some
previous studies.7,8 Although the linearity for paeoniflorin for the
HPLC-DAD was relative narrow, it still included the quantity range of
paeoniflorin in different incubation conditions.
4. When talking about regression, it should be R-squared.
Answer: We appreciate the suggestion made by the reviewer. We
have modified the regression and we hope that the revision is
acceptable.
5. The figure legends need to be expanded to provide context,
nature of experimental data, explaining the samples/controls, etc.
across the board.
Answer: We appreciate the suggestion made by the reviewer. We
have supplied more detailed information marked red in the revised
manuscript as far as possible and we hope that the revision is
acceptable.
6. It is not clear why the mass spec has been operated in negative
ionization mode only. The structure of the parent compound and
metabolites do not suggest better ionization in negative mode - instead,
empirically, it seems positive mode could be better - can the authors
provide rationale/experimental data to support the use of ESI- in this
paper?
Answer: We apologize for the confusion and the explanation was
given as follow. Since the proton existed in acidic mobile phase
usually combines with the detected compound, it is more easily
detected in positive mode especially when the detected compound is a
base. But according to references9-11, paeoniflorin and most of its
metabolites were also detected in negative mode when the mobile
phase was acidic. It was supposed that the acid radical ion HCOO- was
used to combine with paeoniflorin and its metabolites, and those ions
combined HCOO- were more easily detected in negative mode. In our
previous study12, the quasi-molecular ion peaks ([M+FA-H]- of
paeoniflorin and most of its metabolites) were appeared. So the
negative ionization mode was chosen in LC-MS detection.
7. In most cases HRMS and MS/MS with subsequent
computational analyses have been used to assign full chemical
structures to the metabolites. This is not ideal - unless compared
against authentic synthetic standards, or additional NMR-based
analyses conducted, such assignments are tentative at best and should
be clearly indicated.
Answer: We appreciate the suggestion made by the reviewer. We
completely agree with reviewer’s comment and hope that the structure
of the new compound could be identified by comparing with authentic
synthetic standards or by NMR data. However, the conversion rate of
paeoniflorin catalyzed by enzymes in liver microsomes was low and
the biotransformation products obtained were diverse and the quantity
was less. Hence, purifying and enriching the new compound were very
hard with the limits of separation and extraction methods at the present
stage in our experimental group. We appreciate to
your valuable suggestions about identified metabolites and we have
made some corrections marked red in the revised manuscript.
8. “This study explored the metabolism of paeoniflorin in vitro by
rat liver microsomes, and 20 metabolites of paeoniflorin were found,
in which 6 metabolites of paeoniflorin (including four new metabolites)
were identified.” - It is not clear what happened to the remaining 14
metabolites. Please clarify. It would be better to provide more details
on them, e.g. tentative molecular formula, etc. in table 2.
Answer: We thank the reviewer for perspective and extensive
detailed comments. We have tried our best to further speculate the
tentative molecular formula and other details on the remaining eight
metabolites in table 2. We were unable to provide more information
about the other six metabolites due to the limited technology of
processing experimental data in our laboratory and we would
unremittingly improve our technology of processing experimental
data.
9. M3 trace shows a second peak - did the authors investigate
this?
Answer: We appreciate these questions made by the reviewer
about the problem in our research. For UPLC-MS analysis, the newly
appeared chromatographic peak (M3) at 7.07 min was identified by
comparing total ion chromatogram (TIC) of the experimental group
with those of control group 2 and control group 3. Next, the precursor
ion within 6.50 to 7.50 min was detected for UPLC-MS/MS analysis
to obtain the product ions which were used to identify the target
compound. Although there were two peaks appeared in the extracted
ion chromatogram of m/z 333.1336[M-H]-, the peak of 7.07 min was
M3.
10. I would suggest that prior to resubmission, the authors
consider seeking the assistance of a professional editing service to

have endeavored to correct all the improper syntax of sentences and
typos errors in manuscript.
2. The authors are required to strictly adhere with the format of
the journal while preparing their manuscript. The ethical issues and the
conflicts if interests should be properly addressed.
Answer: We thank the reviewer for perceptive and extensive
detailed comments. This manuscript has been revised according to
your comments including ethical issues and the conflicts.
3. The objectives of this study should be clearly defined.
Answers: We apologize for this confusion and give the following
explanation. Our laboratory has already studied the metabolism of
paeoniflorin in human intestinal microflora (HIM)2 and in rats12. In
order to explore the metabolic mechanism of paeoniflorin in the liver
and understand the complete metabolism process of paeoniflorin in
vivo, this research is complementary for the metabolism process of
paeoniflorin. In addition, we had some supplements to define the
objectives marked red in line 23-24, 69-70 and 353-355 in the revised
manuscript.
4. The isolation and characterisation of microsomes from rat liver
is not clear.
Answer: We apologize for the confusion about the isolation and
characterization of microsomes. We have made appropriate
supplementary for this point marked red in line 161-175.
5. The methods used for analysis of metabolites should be
explained in brief.
Answer: We apologize for the confusion about the methods used
for analysis of metabolites. Actually, the strategy for analysis of
metabolites was explained in manuscript in line 253-266.
6. The legend to the Tables and Figures should have a brief
explanation about the methodology and the notations used so as to
make them self explanatory.
Answer: We appreciate the suggestion made by the reviewer. We
have supplied more detailed information marked red in the revised
manuscript as far as possible and we hope that the revision is
acceptable.
7. The discussion should adhere with the results.
Answer: We appreciate the suggestion made by the reviewer. We
have made appropriate supplementary for this point marked red in line
329-332.
Response to reviewer #3:
1. (a) Are the levels of these CES enzymes low in mirosomes that
they do not see hydrolysis at the ester linkage? Based on previous
reports (Arch Biochem Biophys. 2012 Jun 1; 522(1): 44–56), the
expression of CES1 is close to 60ug/mg of microsomal fraction. This
high amount would result in hydrolysis at the ester linkage. Why do
the authors not see this product?
Answer: We appreciate the significant question made by the
reviewer. Firstly, it was unexpected for us that only one hydrolysis
product at the ester linkage of paeoniflorin was found, but that was the
real experimental result. Secondly, if it was the metabolic site that we
envisioned, the conversion rate of paeoniflorin must be high in liver
microsomes due to the abundant hydrolase. According to the scholar
Takeda’s7,8 and our researches, the conversion rate of paeoniflorin in
liver microsomes was very low. This fact once again reconfirmed that
the hydrolysis at the ester linkage did not play a dominant role in the
metabolism of paeoniflorin in liver microsomes. As for the reason why
the hydrolysis of paeoniflorin at the ester linkage did not occur
efficiently, we speculated that the steric hindrance might obstruct the
catalysis of hydrolase at the ester linkage due to the structure of
paeoniflorin.
(b) Secondly, this reviewer would be interested in seeing
co-incubation of paeoniflorin with commercially available CES1/2/3
and would like the authors to show if paeoniflorin is hydrolyzed with
CES1/2/3.
Answer: We completely agree with the reviewer on the issue that
paeoniflorin would be hydrolyzed with CES1/2/3. Regarding the
proposal for experiments on co-incubation of paeoniflorin with
commercially available CES1/2/3, we believe that the reviewer know
that commercially available CES1/2/3 is a little bit expensive, and the
fund supporting our research cannot sequentially afford to do such
experiments. However, the reviewer's opinion is very reasonable and
we will plan to investigate this interesting aspect in more detail if we
have the chance in the future.
2. The manuscript is riddled with several typographical,
grammatical and sentence construction errors. This reviewer suggests
the use of a professional scientific writer to improve the writing of the
manuscript. This is improve its readability and ultimately the impact
on readers of the manuscript and the journal.
Answer: We thank the reviewer for constructive comments of the
manuscript. This manuscript has been revised according to your
comments by a professional in English-language skills, and we have
endeavored to correct all the improper syntax of sentences in
manuscript.
3. In the introduction (last paragraph), the authors state that
HRMS is a recent technique for metabolite identification. This
reviewer disagrees. HRMS for metabolite identification is no longer a
recent technique and has been around since the turn of the century.
Answer: We thank the reviewer for constructive detailed
comments and we have implemented your suggestions as described in
line 80 of the revised manuscript .
4. Experimental section:
(a) Please provide catalog numbers of all reagents used.
Answer: We thank the reviewer for constructive detailed
comments and we have tried our best to implement your suggestions
as described in the section “Chemicals and reagents” in the revised
manuscript.
(b) Section on preparation of liver microsomes – the authors
mention the use of phenobarbital sodium in rats at 60mg/kg. Please
provide a rationale for this.
Answer: We thank the reviewer for the comments of the
manuscript. Phenobarbital is the liver enzyme inducer to promote
metabolism of exogenous substance. According to references13-15, the
dosage of phenobarbital at 60 mg/kg was appropriate to induce rat
liver microsomes.
(c) Section on microsomal incubation conditions and preparation
of sample – How were the microsomes inactivated? Please provide
details.
Answer: We thank the reviewer for constructive comments of the
manuscript. We have implemented your suggestions as described in
detail below and the revised manuscript marked red in line 205-207.
The liver microsomes and coenzymes were added into Tris-HCl buffer
and then keeped for 10 min in boiling water bath to make the
metabolic system inactive.
5. Results and Discussion section:
(a) Metabolites Identification – The authors mention the use of
software and database they developed in-house for the purpose. Has
this been published before? Is it available to the wider scientific
community?
Answer: We appreciate the significant comments made by the
reviewer. The software and database has been published before2,12.
