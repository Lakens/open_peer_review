General comments:
This project investigates the clonal- and species-level variation in life history traits in response to
changing nutrient levels. While the methods are sound, the statistical analyses and interpretations
are fraught. First, some major conclusions rest on simply visual interpretation of PC plots, rather
than rigorous statistical tests (though MANOVAs were used some). Second, definitions of
plasticity (in terms of the methods used to quantify plasticity) miss the mark. Using centroid
values from PC plots to quantify plasticity (while ignoring the variance within groups in PC
space) is likely to misrepresent the degree of plasticity. Furthermore (and perhaps most
importantly), there seems to be a confounding of ‘sensitivity’ and ‘plasticity’ throughout the
manuscript (see multiple comments below). I suggest a very thorough consideration of how to
calculate plasticity (e.g., reaction norm approach), and a more careful conveyance of the precise
definitions of (adaptive or not) plasticity and sensitivity in the MS.
Line-by-line comments:
Abstract, pg. 2, lines 7-8: While I agree that there are often quite strong links between life history
traits and fitness, this is not a quality of life history traits alone. Since this statement is the crux of
‘selling’ the importance of looking at life history traits, per se, I suggest reframing this.
Pg. 2, line 18: Edit this line to read ‘…among species across two different environmental
conditions…’
Pg. 2, line 25: See comments below regarding how you define plasticity (and thus formulate your
predictions)
Pg 3, line 20: Delete ‘before death’
Pg 3, line 30: Change ‘lowering’ to ‘decreasing’
Pg 4, lines 25-27: Use ‘e.g.,’ before these references since many references exist for each of these
phenomena
Pg 4: lines 27-33: This sentence is cumbersome and confusing. Please rephrase.
Pg 5, line 22: Change ‘are’ to ‘is’ and add ‘each of’ after ‘from’
Pg 7, lines 3-4: Please expand on the 'confounding issue' (do you mean to say that the
confounding issue is due to inbreeding?) with clones MA1 and MA2.
Pg 7, line 8: Please report the densities in the housing containers. About how many animals were
kept in the 900mL jars and 60mL jars?
Pg 7, line 21: Please provide the methods (could just be a sentence) for determining the amount of
3
algae that were provided to the maternal lines. Also, some of this information is redundant with
the next paragraph – please rectify.
Pg 7, line 49-54: Please provide more detail on how the LoP and HiP treatments were prepared
(e.g., more detail than just the C:P ratios).
Pg 8, line 46: Change ‘…to look at the significance of’ to ‘examine the effects of’
Pg 8, line 51: Did you use non-parametric statistics to look at these outcome variables then?
Without a statistical test for these variables or a satisfactory explanation for the omission of these
tests, these analyses are incomplete.
Pg 9, line 5: ‘Visual inspection of a stem and leaf plot’ is not sufficient detail for how outliers were
identified. What are the criteria for the stem and leaf plots used to determine outliers? Usually,
it’s that outliers are two SDs from the mean value.
Pg 9, line 37: Change ‘within’ to ‘in’
Pg 9, line 25: Change ‘looked at’ to ‘examined’ or something similar. Check throughout the
manuscript that this sort of casual language is corrected (e.g., line 29: ‘In order to look at variance,
we looked at…’).
Pg 10, line 5-8: What you call P-sensitivity is essentially a reaction norm (i.e., trait change across
phosphorus treatments). This, then, could very reasonably called plasticity as well. In fact, in
many cases, there is more grounding to call this plasticity than the COV and centroid differences.
This introduces a crucial area of potential misunderstanding in this manuscript that, indeed,
underlies the entire work (even the title!).
Pg 10, line 28-30: I don’t think the inclusion of PC analyses in this paper adds significantly. In fact,
it’s quite redundant with the MANOVA results. Visual inspection of a PC plot is enough to give
you some idea that groups (here, species) differ in the variables that you’re interested in. But, I
would like to see more rigorous statistical investigation of the questions at play. Visual inspection
of the PC plot, for example shows separation along PC1 (size variables) for D. magna and along
PC2 (reproductive variables) for pulex/obstusa. But what of statistical significance? That’s why
you’ve done the MANOVA.
The other thing that the PC analyses give you (that the MANOVA doesn’t) is the ability to
calculate centroids for groups. I have serious concerns, however, about using centroid separation
as a measure of plasticity. Centroids, much like point estimates, don’t capture the variance within
groups. For example, two groups might have separated centroids (so, by your methods, you’d
conclude plasticity), but may, in fact, overlap quite heavily in the (e.g.,) minimum convex
polygon that surrounds each group in PC space (due to shifting of the density of points).
Pg 11, line 36: delete the parenthetical ‘(i.e., were more constrained)’. Make sure that when you
talk about there being less variance elsewhere in the paper that you don’t jump to the conclusion
that phenotypes are more constrained. ‘Constrained’ represents a very specific biological
statement about the limits of plasticity that may or may not apply in this case.
Pg 13, line 12: Just to point this out… regarding a previous comment re: contraints, here, the
discussion of constraints is merited (that starts with ‘Allometric constraints…’) since it’s
discussion/speculation and appropriate language (e.g., ‘may’) is used.
Pg 14, Line 25-28: The distinction between sensitivity and trait variation are hard to understand
4
throughout this paper and thus need to be better defined. On one hand, if sensitivity is measured
as changes in traits from low- to high-P environments (as the equations in the methods define it),
then one would expect that, by definition, sensitivity is trait variation (across environments), at
least at the clonal level. If the author means to say that sensitivity (at the clonal level) is one thing
and trait variation (at the species level) is another, then they should be careful to make this
distinction (and remind the reader of this distinction) throughout the MS. Again, since this
distinction seems central to the message of the MS, much more careful effort towards both
defining and quantifying these must be taken.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Michael Tobler):
We have received the feedback from two reviewers. Both see merit in the study and agreed that
the experimental approach was sound, but they also found significant issues particularly
associated with the statistical analyses. Accordingly, the manuscript will need significant revision
and cannot be accepted for publication in its present form. However, if the author can address the
reviewers' concerns and revise the manuscript accordingly, the paper should be suitable for
publication in RSOS.

The authors present a revised version of their manuscript in which they explore interspecific
variation in life history traits in response to nutritional environments. They have done well to
eliminate the PC analyses from the manuscript and focus instead on MANOVA analyses, which
strengthen the overall statistical approach. The findings are generally expected, but interesting.
The overall comparative approach is a strength.
Most of my critiques at this point are minor (see below). I would, however, like to see some effort
spent in clarifying the expectation that mean and variance in responses should be inverse
correlated. Indeed, my expectation for many biological traits is the opposite: that mean and
variance in responses are generally positively correlated. This ends up bearing somewhat heavily
on the manuscript since this prediction is introduced in the introduction and its implications are
discussed in the discussion.

I have a few minor comments that should be addressed for more transparency.
Introduction:
P5 L16 “therefore clonal variation may significantly add to genetic contributions”. The meaning
10
of this sentence is cryptic, can you try to reformulate?
Methods
P6 L40 I think one word is missing in the sentence “finnish pond from a ephemeral with
dessication”
“incidental ambient lighting”: I suppose not only the stock culture but also the experiment were
in these conditions. When was the experiment conducted?
Please provide more details about spectrophotometer measurements: wavelength, and perhaps a
reference to the literature on this already established procedure?
Please provide details about the experimental animals. Especially in smaller species, a single
clutch contains less than 20 neonates, so to reach the indicated number clutches must have been
pooled. Were all experimental animals born on the same day from different mothers, or were
they all from the same mother but born on different days? I am aware this is a logistical issue but
also important when interpreting results, because it influences the observed variance.
P9 word missing “mortality accounts for less than five percent…”
P13 (middle) replace “we hypothesize” with “I hypothesize”
P14 The superflea Tessier reference is incomplete, I suppose it was a formatting error.
There is no R code available in supp Mat, please provide it
Figure 2 is hard to read. Please consider using a white background, as grey on grey is not easy. Is
label_version_3
RSOS having a limitation on color figures? If not I would consider using colors in this figure,
because even if “only” 4 shades of grey aren’t much, it is a bit hard. I also wish the symbols were
larger, and I am wondering why the symbols for mean clutch size look different in shape?

The manuscript was re-assessed by two reviewers and both generally agree that the author has
adequately revised the manuscript. They provide some additional feedback that should help to
improve the manuscript. I would particularly like to echo two reviewer comments, one
pertaining the clarification of why a negative correlation between mean and variance are
expected, and one pertaining the removal of gray background in the figures. In the context of the
13
latter, I should add that color figures are free, and using color may help to make figure 2 more
clear.

Comments to the Author(s)
I have a few minor comments that should be addressed for more transparency.
Introduction:
P5 L16 “therefore clonal variation may significantly add to genetic contributions”. The meaning
of this sentence is cryptic, can you try to reformulate?
Methods
P6 L40 I think one word is missing in the sentence “finnish pond from a ephemeral with
dessication”
“incidental ambient lighting”: I suppose not only the stock culture but also the experiment were
in these conditions. When was the experiment conducted?
Please provide more details about spectrophotometer measurements: wavelength, and perhaps a
reference to the literature on this already established procedure?
Please provide details about the experimental animals. Especially in smaller species, a single
clutch contains less than 20 neonates, so to reach the indicated number clutches must have been
pooled. Were all experimental animals born on the same day from different mothers, or were
they all from the same mother but born on different days? I am aware this is a logistical issue but
also important when interpreting results, because it influences the observed variance.
P9 word missing “mortality accounts for less than five percent…”
P13 (middle) replace “we hypothesize” with “I hypothesize”
P14 The superflea Tessier reference is incomplete, I suppose it was a formatting error.
There is no R code available in supp Mat, please provide it
Figure 2 is hard to read. Please consider using a white background, as grey on grey is not easy. Is
label_version_4
RSOS having a limitation on color figures? If not I would consider using colors in this figure,
because even if “only” 4 shades of grey aren’t much, it is a bit hard. I also wish the symbols were
larger, and I am wondering why the symbols for mean clutch size look different in shape?

This study explores life-history trait variation within/among species and proposes to
mine the effects of genetics/environment, body size, and plasticity/sensitivity on daphnid trait
ression. Overall, the experimental methods seem to be mostly solid, and the importance of
ation in reproductive traits with nutrient limitation is a key finding that has been relatively
rlooked in the stoichiometric literature. This study could make an important scientific
tribution; however, I found myself getting lost at certain points and questioning the rational
interpretation behind some of the predictions and results. Therefore, I think that the
uscript might benefit by addressing some major and minor points.
or Points
cture
he study questions are clearly laid out at the end of the introduction, which I appreciate. But,
lieve that they can be better setup in the introduction and discussed in the later parts of the
uscript. There are introductory paragraphs about food quality, clones and plasticity, which
up 2 of the 3 study questions, but nothing about body size in the introduction. Please
sider adding a body size paragraph to justify rational for why organisms of different body
might be expected to grow differently. Also, while you do talk about plasticity you don’t say
it might be related to sensitivity until the final intro paragraph, which left me thoroughly
fused. You hint at a mechanism in the discussion, but it would be easier for the reader if you
this out in the plasticity paragraph.
might’ve missed it, but I only found one mention of the first study aim in the results and not
ly much discussion of it in the discussion section. This might make for an interesting
ussion paragraph along with talkin about the the interactions between genotype and the
ironment. These are also tested but not thoroughly discussed in the paper.
s
here was some death in these experiments, but as survival data was not presented, I don’t
e a feel for how this might’ve influenced your results. I understand if survival wasn’t part of
r story, but please report the proportion of individuals that died for each species so that we
assess the robustness of the results. Similarly, please explain the rational for the 5 day
ival cutoff reported on Page 7 Line 25? It seems to me that there would still be a significant
erent between body sizes of day 7 and day 20 animals which could affect your variance
mates.
s the PCA is central to your story, the reader could use some extra information to help
rpret it. Please state whether your variables were centered and scaled so that we can be
ain that individual variables didn’t have a greater influence on the ordination. Also, you
ort in the MANOVA calculation that certain variables were skewed. How was this handled in
PCA ordination? Finally, please report the correlations between each variable and axis so that
can confirm that each PC axis was related to “growth” and reproduction as you say.
m still really confused about how the COV-sensitivity analysis was conducted. The COV’s
m to be calculated with diet treatments for each species and for each individual trait whereas
sensitivity analysis is calculated on multivariate data for each species. My question is if you
including both food treatment and trait variation (individual on the x-axis and multivariate on
y) on both axes, can we actually consider these two measurements to be independent? To me
ems self-evident that univariate and multivariate trait variation should be positively
elated. Please provide further description and justification for this analysis.
ults Interpretation
ince growth wasn’t calculated using the common metric mass specific growth rate, I'm not
that growth is the most accurate way to describe this axis. Specifically, since you don't take
account different starting masses, there's no way to directly compare growth rates across
cies. SAM is also generally considered to be a reproductively related trait as it is assumed to
nder selection from size-selective predators and is inherently related to reproduction. I would
more comfortable if you referred to this axis as relating to body size.
found myself questioning some of the results interpretation in the discussion section.
n the first two paragraphs, you talk about the buffering effects of clonal variation and how
might help species persistence in different or variable environments. However, phenotypic
ation among clones was the weakest of any variable in your study and as you say these
es weren’t from the same populations, so it’s not clear to me how genotypic variation that
s not lead to phenotypic differences among clones might be adaptive in natural environments.
n the 3rd paragraph, I’m not sure that your results show that larger-bodied daphnia are more
cted by food quality than smaller bodied daphnia. Table 3 shows that this pattern is trait
cific, Figure 2 shows that D. obtusa appears to be more variable than D. magna and figure 4
ms to show that obtusa is the most variable of the 3 species.
or Points
L31: It is debatable whether P is the ultimate limiting nutrient in freshwater systems. This
position is not supported by your reference to Sterner 2008 and certainly not by the meta
lyses of Elser et al. 2007 or any of the multitude of studies examining N & P co-limitation
ducted in the last decade or so. It certainly is an important limiting element, but not
essarily the most important.
L30: It’s true that daphnids could be more susceptible to P-limitation, but as most
ironments are experiencing P-loading rather than P reductions it is unclear to me how they
ht be used as an indicator organism. Wouldn’t it make more sense to use an organism
sitive to excess P?
L12: “Clonal variation can be considered as important as species identity” Please explain
t this importance is referring to.
L5: Are these predictions here? Do they all refer to the final study question 3? If not, you
ht consider moving them up with their corresponding question or spelling out some of these
nections specifically in respect to question 3 earlier in the paragraph bc this information
ld be confusing out of context.
L3: Another caveat that you might want to add is that these animals have been adapted to lab
ditions for long periods of time which might influence the magnitude of their plastic
onses compared to animals in the wild.
L47: So the total amount fed to these animals would be 0.5 mg C day? Can you show that this
l of food is not limiting to the larger magna and pulex species given that there were also
ly neonates feeding in these tubes later on in the experiment? Could this account for some of
trait variance in these larger body sized animals?
L38-45: These sentences might be better off in the results section.
L12: Do you have quantitative statistics to support this? I only see descriptive statistics for
vidual traits in the tables and figures.
L38: This shift might be moved to the discussion where it can be discussed further.
L34: It’s not clear how these phylogenetic differences could’ve been related to plasticity.
work by Seidendorf 2010 doesn’t support this, but if you believe that this might be the case,
ld it be worth including it as a covariate in your analyses?
L51: You might consider changing this to “partially matches the prediction”. There might be
ndividual magna and pulex clone that is more sensitive, but on average obtusa seems to be
most sensitive species.
L19-21: It would be really helpful to develop this idea in the introduction.
L38: Hood and Sterner 2014 didn’t measure clutch frequency or size.
L 43: I really like this idea, so if you get a chance you could expand upon it in future
ions of this manuscript or if not in future work.
les and Figures: It might help if you rearrange these to put large- and small-bodied animals
ther.
legends for Figure 3 could also do with a bit of reformatting.

eral comments to the editor and reviewers:
ry much appreciated the care and thought put into the reviews of this manuscript. Both reviewers had
or concerns over the robustness of my analysis and therefore the conclusions/interpretations that I
from the study. Therefore, I have completely redone my analyses and took special care to not draw
conclusions/discussion points qualitatively. I have relegated the PC analysis, used for visual
rpretation, to the supplemental materials, and focused on the MANOVA for interpretation as
ested by reviewer 1. In addition, I ran two-sample t-tests to quantitatively test the claims I made on
hniid size and their effects on responsiveness and variation (before sensitivity and plasticity, see next
graph for changes in terms). I also ran a correlation analysis to determine quantitatively the
ciation between species-level responses and intraspecific variation. Because some of these new
yses changed my results, the discussion has been substantially changed.
ddition, another major concern was the way that I had (mis)defined plasticity and sensitivity. I have
fied my manuscript to investigate intraspecific trait variation (COVs) and species-level responses
an trait in HP – mean trait in LP: once defined as sensitivity when it could be plasticity) to remove
misunderstanding of what I am trying to address. This has been reflected throughout the manuscript,
should adequately remove this major concern of confounding sensitivity and plasticity.
er major revisions:
ised the introduction to focus less on the stress-aspect of the environmental treatment and more on
esponses Daphnia exhibit under differing food quality, as well as ensuring that I adequately discuss
of the study’s aims.
ct size calculations, and an additional two-way ANOVA, was moved to the supplementary materials,
ey did not add anything to the main message of the manuscript after re-doing the other analyses and
esults of the ANOVA were insignificant, so they have been relegated to supplements.

eral comments:
project investigates the clonal- and species-level variation in life history traits in response to
ging nutrient levels. While the methods are sound, the statistical analyses and interpretations are
ght. First, some major conclusions rest on simply visual interpretation of PC plots, rather than
rous statistical tests (though MANOVAs were used some). Second, definitions of plasticity (in terms
e methods used to quantify plasticity) miss the mark. Using centroid values from PC plots to quantify
ticity (while ignoring the variance within groups in PC space) is likely to misrepresent the degree of
ticity. Furthermore (and perhaps most importantly), there seems to be a confounding of ‘sensitivity’
‘plasticity’ throughout the manuscript (see multiple comments below). I suggest a very thorough
ideration of how to calculate plasticity (e.g., reaction norm approach), and a more careful conveyance

ial area of potential misunderstanding in this manuscript that, indeed, underlies the entire work (even
itle!).
general comments to the editor. I changed the approach of my analysis to address this comment.
0, line 28-30: I don’t think the inclusion of PC analyses in this paper adds significantly. In fact, it’s
e redundant with the MANOVA results. Visual inspection of a PC plot is enough to give you some
that groups (here, species) differ in the variables that you’re interested in. But, I would like to see
e rigorous statistical investigation of the questions at play. Visual inspection of the PC plot, for
mple shows separation along PC1 (size variables) for D. magna and along PC2 (reproductive
ables) for pulex/obstusa. But what of statistical significance? That’s why you’ve done the MANOVA.
other thing that the PC analyses give you (that the MANOVA doesn’t) is the ability to calculate
roids for groups. I have serious concerns, however, about using centroid separation as a measure of
ticity. Centroids, much like point estimates, don’t capture the variance within groups. For example,
groups might have separated centroids (so, by your methods, you’d conclude plasticity), but may, in
overlap quite heavily in the (e.g.,) minimum convex polygon that surrounds each group in PC space
to shifting of the density of points).

ts of plasticity that may or may not apply in this case.

onstraints is merited (that starts with ‘Allometric constraints…’) since it’s discussion/speculation and
opriate language (e.g., ‘may’) is used.
elcome clarification, but no edit indicated here.
4, Line 25-28: The distinction between sensitivity and trait variation are hard to understand
ughout this paper and thus need to be better defined. On one hand, if sensitivity is measured as
ges in traits from low- to high-P environments (as the equations in the methods define it), then one
ld expect that, by definition, sensitivity is trait variation (across environments), at least at the clonal
l. If the author means to say that sensitivity (at the clonal level) is one thing and trait variation (at the
ies level) is another, then they should be careful to make this distinction (and remind the reader of
distinction) throughout the MS. Again, since this distinction seems central to the message of the MS,
h more careful effort towards both defining and quantifying these must be taken.
general comments to the editor. I agree that I may not fully understand the distinction between these
s. Having a reader restate my definitions really showed me how unclear they were. I admit that I
d not understand how the reviewer was interpreting my terms. I have taken much more care to think
ut how to define and quantify these calculations. I have decided to reframe the manuscript’s terms
gether to avoid misunderstanding. I have classified changes in traits from low to high as species-level
onses and made sure my trait variation was calculated at the species level, giving the amount of
ation within each species (intraspecific variation) and did not make any claims to compare variation
in or between clones.

that visual inspection of the PC plots is qualitative assessment rather than qualitative. I have moved
plots to the supplements for visual purposes only. For visual interpretation only, it is acceptable to

ysis.
m still really confused about how the COV-sensitivity analysis was conducted. The COV’s seem to

ysis is calculated on multivariate data for each species. My question is if you are including both food
ment and trait variation (individual on the x-axis and multivariate on the y) on both axes, can we
ally consider these two measurements to be independent? To me it seems self-evident that univariate
multivariate trait variation should be positively correlated. Please provide further description and
fication for this analysis.

found myself questioning some of the results interpretation in the discussion section. A) In the first
paragraphs, you talk about the buffering effects of clonal variation and how this might help species
istence in different or variable environments. However, phenotypic variation among clones was the
kest of any variable in your study and as you say these clones weren’t from the same populations, so
not clear to me how genotypic variation that does not lead to phenotypic differences among clones
ht be adaptive in natural environments. B) In the 3rd paragraph, I’m not sure that your results show
larger-bodied daphnia are more affected by food quality than smaller bodied daphnia. Table 3 shows
this pattern is trait specific, Figure 2 shows that D. obtusa appears to be more variable than D. magna
figure 4 seems to show that obtusa is the most variable of the 3 species.
reviewer is correct on both fronts. Clonal variation and size did not affect responses to food stress
I had claimed. Re-doing the analyses with quantitative evidence made that clear, and I have removed
e claims, and significantly changed the discussion so as not to make correct interpretations based on
data.

Abstract
Currently organisms are experiencing changes in their environment at an unprecedented rate. Therefore
the study of the contributions to and responses in traits linked to fitness is crucial, as they have direct
consequences on a population’s success in persisting under such change. Daphnia is used as a model
organism as the genus contains keystone primary consumers in aquatic food webs. A life-history table
experiment (LHTE) using four species of Daphnia was conducted to compare variation in life-history
traits among species across two different environmental conditions (high and low phosphorous
availability). Results indicate that the food quality environment had the most impact on life-history traits,
while genetic contributions to traits were higher at the species-level than clonal-level. Higher trait
variation and species-level responses to P-limitation was more evident in reproductive traits, while growth
traits were found to be less affected by food quality and had less variation. Exploring trait variation and
potential plasticity in organisms is increasingly important to consider as a potential mechanism for
population persistence given the fluctuations in environmental stressors we are currently experiencing.

Background
With increasing environmental stress, many suites of organismal traits are expected to experience strong
selection, with life-history traits potentially being among the most impacted (Bradshaw and Holzapfel
2008, Reed et al. 2011). Life-history traits have a direct link to fitness, as an organism’s success is built
upon an ability to grow to reproductive age, the timing of reproduction events, as well as cumulative
reproductive output. Therefore, life-history theory has established direct associations between a
population’s environment and life-history trait evolution (Stearns 1992, Agrawal et al. 2013).
Food stress has been shown to create a variety of life-history trait effects in organisms, which
include longer developmental time, decreases in body size, and lowered fecundity (Ellers & Van
Alphen 1997; Nylin & Gotthard 1998). Food stress can be experimentally manipulated through
decreasing a limiting resource. In many freshwater lentic systems, phosphorus (P) is one of the
limiting nutrients (Wetzel 1983, Sterner 2008), with anthropogenic inputs of P in aquatic systems
forcing rapid change in zooplankton populations (Frisch et al. 2014). P-limitation (i.e., low food
quality) has effects on Daphnia life-history traits such as growth, reproduction, and senescence
(e.g., Dudycha 2003, Jeyasingh and Weider 2005). Members of the genus Daphnia (Cladocera:
Anomopoda) have one of the highest P contents amongst zooplankton, so they are predicted to be
more responsive to P-limitation compared to other zooplankton taxa (Sterner and Schulz 1998);
however P content alone is not sufficient to predict species-level responses in growth (DeMott and
Pape 2004).
Daphnia have a cyclically parthenogenic life-cycle, which includes bouts of asexual
reproduction under good growing conditions, and sexual reproduction during times of food stress,
changes in photoperiod, and crowding cues (Kleiven et al. 1992). This creates the unique
advantage of establishing multiple clonal lineages in a population leading to the maintenance of
high genetic variation in many natural Daphnia populations (Innes et al. 1986; Spitze et al. 1991;
Weider et al. 1999). In addition, researchers have found large strong clonal responses to predator
cues (Spitze 1992, Weider and Pijanowska 1993), nutrient limitation (Lynch 1989, Weider et al.
2004), habitat selection (de Meester 1994) and toxins (Baird et al. 1990, Walls 1997). Intraspecific
genetic variation has been shown to have effects on population-level processes like colonization
(Crutsinger et al. 2008, Crawford and Whitney 2010), coexistence (Lankau et al. 2009), and
predation (Post et al. 2008). For Daphnia, clonal diversity is better maintained under P-limitation
(Weider et al. 2008), therefore clonal variation may significantly contribute to overall add to
genetic contributionsvariation among Daphnia species.. Formatted: Font: Italic
Under the hypothesis of environmental buffering, influential life-history traits should have
minimal trait variation, as fitness would be heavily dependent on minimal change within important
vital rate constraints (Pfister 1998). Over multiple life-history tables, Pfister (1998) showed that
traits with the highest variation had the least response to temporal change. This could lead to
ademonstrates a potential tradeoff between trait variation and species-level responses to
environmental change, where traits that are more vital to fitness would show less trait variation.
However, lLife-history traits could vary in the amount of variation seen under food stress; P-
limitation has been shown to differentially affect somatic growth rates and reproductive investment
like in egg size and abortion rates within Daphnia due to differing nutritional requirements (Hood
and Sterner 2014). This could lead to a potential tradeoff between trait variation and species-level
responses to environmental change. Increased intraspecific variation could allow for flexibility at
the species level, and potentially mediate environmental effects on life-history traits. Alternatively,
trait variation and species-level responses to environmental changes could be positively correlated,
as traits with low variation may have a lower range of trait values that are measurable in species-
level responses (i.e., a floor effect), and it has been documented that more intraspecific trait
variation also leads to higher variation in intraspecific responses across environments (e.g., Siefert
and Ritchie 2016). This trend between intraspecific trait variation and intraspecific responses could
translate to species-level responses as well.
Another mechanism to mitigate environmental effects is an organism’s body size. Daphnia’s
physiology allow them to alter filtering rates under different food quality environments
(Sahuquillo et al. 2007), although there are phylogenetic constraints. Jeyasingh (2007) suggested
that evolution should favor more responsive physiologies for smaller organisms in order to counter
frequent shifts in nutrient limitation. Smaller aquatic organisms use phosphorus at higher rates
(Johannes 1964), which means that they would experience P-limitation more frequently. This
could lead to smaller-bodied species becoming more plastic than larger-bodied species.
This present study aims to address the following: 1) how much does the environment vs.
genetic (taxonomic) identity contribute to life-history trait variation? Do clonal lines contribute
more to trait variation than species identity? 2) Do smaller species exhibit more plastic
physiologies? And 3) what is the potential relationship between intraspecific variation and species-
level responses to food stress?
Methods
Study organism
Daphnia is a cosmopolitan genus (Sarma et al. 2005, Lampert 2011). Three clonal lineages from
each of four different Daphnia species (D. magna, D. mendotae, D. obtusa, and D. pulex) were
collected from a variety of laboratory stocks (see Table 1). These clonal lineages span the three
subgenera of Daphnia, ranging across North America and Europe, and come from various aquatic
habitats (Table 1). D. magna clones used in this study originated from South Dakota, Finland and
Germany from a spectrum of habitats. The South Dakotan clone (MA3) came from a permanent
lake, a shallow (< 2 m) prairie pot-hole (Weider et al. 2004). MA2 and MA1are both inbred lines
from an original genetic cross between a Finnish clone and a German clone. MA2 was inbred for
three generations and MA1 was inbred for one generation (Dieter Ebert, Switzerland, personal
communication). The environment of the parental clones include a Finnish clone from a
ephemeral pond with desiccation in spring/summer and freezing during autumn/winter and a clone
from a German semi-permanent pond, with freezing in the winter (Roulin et al. 2013). In
addition, D. pulex and D. obtusa clones came from temporary ponds in the U.S. Midwest, while
D. mendotae came from permanent lakes in the U.S. Midwest. One D. mendotae clone (ME3)
experienced high levels of mortality early on in the experiment, and was subsequently dropped
from the analyses. These contrasting environments have created very different evolutionary
trajectories for these species. However, a couple of caveats should be noted: these lineages have
been adapted to lab conditions and may have different capacities in variation and response than
animals collected directly from the field, and a potential confounding issue due to inbreeding
could affect the variation and response for two of the three D. magna clones (MA1 and MA2).
Experimental design
Clonal lineages were maintained as separate populations in 900 mL jars, with regular and plentiful
feeding using the chemostatically-cultured green algae, Scendesmus acutus, at a constant 20°C in
COMBO media (Kilham et al. 1998). These stock cultures maintained an approximate density of
12-30 adults L-1. A small amount of cetyl alcohol (~10 mg) was added to act as a surfactant to
prevent animals from being trapped in the air-water interface. Stock cultures and experimental
animals received equal amounts of 24-hour incidental ambient lighting. Maternal lines for
experimental animals were raised individually in 60 mL jars with 50 mL of COMBO and fed daily
with 1 mg C L-1 of S. acutus that was grown in nutrient-rich conditions (i.e., C:P, ~100:1). The
volumeamount of S. acutus added each day for 1 mg C L-1 was calculated by measuring the
absorbance of chlorophyll at wavelengths 660nm and 740nm using a spectrophotometer
(Spectronic®20 Genesis, Madison, WI) and using a calibrated chlorophyll-carbon correlation to
convert the value to amount of carboncurve (Sterner 1993). Females were monitored every 24-
hours, and first and second clutches were removed. Experimental animals (N = 20 per clone) were
taken from third or later clutches of these individually raised maternal lines within 24 hours to
reduce maternal effects (Ebert 1991). Experimental animals needed to be pooled from multiple
mothers in order to reach the appropriate sample size.
Starting on August 17th, 2013, Aan initial body-length measurement (i.e., start length) of Formatted: Superscript
each experimental animal was taken using a MOTICAM 2300 digital camera and software system
(Motic®, S-05165) mounted to an Olympus BX51 compound dissecting microscope. Length
measurements were taken from the top of the eyespot to the base of the core body, right above the
top of the tail-spine. The tail-spine is known to be morphologically plastic depending on
environmental conditions, and was not measured with core length due to potential confounding
length measurements. Then, experimental animals were placed individually into 60 mL glass jars
with 50 mL of COMBO at 20°C, and were divided into two environmental conditions, high and
low phosphorus (N=10 per clonal line for each environmental treatment). Nutrient media wasere
prepared using a modification of COMBO (Kilham et al. 1998), with additions of sodium nitrate
and potassium phosphate. Animals under a high phosphorus (HiP) feeding regime were fed daily
with 1 mg C L-1 of S. acutus that was grown in nutrient-rich conditions (i.e., 85.01 mg L-1 sodium
nitrate and 8.71 mg L-1 potassium phosphate and C:P ~100:1). A low phosphorus (LoP) feeding
regime consisted of daily 1mg C L-1 feeding of S. acutus grown in nutrient-poor conditions (i.e.,
42.5 mg L-1 sodium nitrate and 0.87 mg L-1 potassium phosphate and C:P ~750:1). These food
conditions should not be limiting in quantity (Sterner and Robinson 1994). Experimental animals
were transferred every two days to fresh jars in order to avoid carbon (detrital) accumulation that
could differentially affect resource availability based on inter-/intra-specific variation of filtering
rates. Experimental animals were monitored daily and size was measured again at maturation,
when first egg development was seen (i.e., age at maturation and length at maturation). Clutch size
was recorded daily, as well as images for neonate body-lengths (N = 5 neonates per clutch in order
to reduce small-clutch bias). Number of clutches, clutch size and mean neonate length (termed
mean clutch length) were calculated from these daily recorded measurements. Dead experimental
animals were measured with the day of death. The experiment ran for 28 days, and at the end of
this period, experimental animals were measured (i.e., end length), as described above.
Statistical Analyses
All analyses were run conducted using R (R core team, 2018) unless specified otherwise in the
methods. Required packages for this analysis included: dplyr (Wickham et al. 2019), ggplot2
(Wickham 2016), ggpubr (Kassambara 2018), and Hmisc (Harrell et al. 2019). Individuals
(replicates) were dropped from analysis if they died within 5 days of the start of the experiment to
prevent bias from missing data in reproductive measurements. Data was screened for outliers and
cases were removed if they were ± 2 standard deviations from a mean value. Mortality accounts
for less than five percent of the study, and a chi-square contingency analysis was run conducted
between species and treatment to ensure that survivorship was independent of species identity or
treatment. A MANOVA was conducted to measure the effects of genetic (species, clonal) and
environmental (phosphorous treatment) contributions on life-history traits (length at maturation,
age at maturation, end length, mean clutch length, mean clutch size, and number of clutches). The
start length of individuals was used as a covariate, as well as maternal line; maternal effects are
common among daphniid studies (Lampert 1993), so maternal line was also used as a potential
confounding variable. Multivariate normality was checked for the dataset using post-hoc residuals
from the MANOVA, and the proportion of variance explained for each main effect was calculated
from Wilks’ lambda, where <U+0001D45D><U+0001D44E><U+0001D45F><U+0001D461><U+0001D456><U+0001D44E><U+0001D459> <U+014B>2 = 1 - <U+0001D6EC>1/<U+0001D460> ; <U+0001D6EC> is Wilks’ lambda for the main effect and s
= min(6, dfeffect) (Tabachnick & Fidell 2013). The MANOVA was run conducted using SPSS
(Version 20, IBM).
In order to identify differences in species-level responses to food stress, multiple linear
regressions were run conducted for each trait, with food treatment and species as factors. The
significance-level was adjusted using the Bonferroni correction (alpha = 0.008). Intraspecific
variation was measured for each species by coefficients of variation (COVs). COVs were
<U+0001D460>
calculated from <U+0001D436><U+0001D449> = , where s = standard deviation and <U+03B3> = mean of the particular life-history
<U+0001D6FE>
trait for that species. Thus, COVs measure the amount of variation within the species for each trait.
Species-level responses to food stress were quantified by using the differences in log-transformed
values between phosphorous treatments (Seidendorf et al. 2010): Species-level response per trait =
ln(traitHIP)-ln(traitLOP) for each species . Individual t-tests were run conducted on species-level
responses and COVs, respectively, between the larger species (D. magna and D. pulex) compared
to the smaller species (D. mendotae and D. obtusa). A Pearson correlation between COVs and
these species-level response values were also run carried out to test the relationship between trait
variation and the magnitude of response to food stress. Separate correlations were run conducted
per species and per trait; the significance-level was adjusted using the Bonferroni correction (alpha
= 0.002).
Results
Mortality in this study was independent of species identity and food treatment (chi-square
contingency, df = 3, <U+03C7>2 = 0.1361, p = 0.9872). Descriptively, under low-phosphorous (LoP)
conditions, all clonal lines of all species showed smaller sizes both at first reproduction, and at the
end of the experiment. Similarly, under LoP, clones exhibited delayed onset of reproduction and
had smaller clutch sizes. The number of clutches varied per clone, as well as their mean clutch
length (See S1). Visual inspection of trait variation mapping using a PCA indicated that species
showed more change in reproductive traits rather than size traits between food treatments (See
S2).
The MANOVA showed that both genetic factors (species, clone) as well as environmental
factors (maternal effects, food treatment) significantly affected life-history traits (Table 2). The length
of individuals at the start, the blocking effect of time, and maternal effects did not significantly affect
life-history traits (Table 2). The proportion of variance explained can be used as a proxy for the
magnitude of effect size metric (Tabachnick & Fidell 2013). Using the <U+0001D45D><U+0001D44E><U+0001D45F><U+0001D461><U+0001D456><U+0001D44E><U+0001D459> <U+014B>2 statistic as a relative
effect size metric, food quality environment explained the greatest proportion of variance (<U+0001D45D><U+0001D44E><U+0001D45F><U+0001D461><U+0001D456><U+0001D44E><U+0001D459> <U+014B>2
= 0.85, dfeffect = 1), while genetic factors explained less; species identify (<U+0001D45D><U+0001D44E><U+0001D45F><U+0001D461><U+0001D456><U+0001D44E><U+0001D459> <U+014B>2 = 0.60, dfeffect =
3) explained more than the clonal level (<U+0001D45D><U+0001D44E><U+0001D45F><U+0001D461><U+0001D456><U+0001D44E><U+0001D459> <U+014B>2 = 0.23, dfeffect = 7) (Table 2). Therefore, the
environment had a stronger main effect than either genetic component, with species identity having a
stronger effect than clonal identity.
The size of the species did not show significant differences in species-level responses
(two-samples t-test, t = 0.75, df = 22, p > 0.1)., but However, they did show significant
differences in the amount of intraspecific variation among traits, with larger species showing more
variation than smaller species (two-samples t-test, t = 8.41, df = 22, p < 0.01).
All life-history traits were impacted by both species identity and the food quality level
(length at maturation, adjusted R2 = 0.921, age at maturation adjusted R2 = 0.670, end length,
adjusted R2 = 0.752. mean clutch length, adjusted R2 = 0.146, mean clutch size, adjusted R2 =
0.708, number of clutches, adjusted R2 = 0.464; all adjusted p < 0.01). Effects of food quality were
detected across all species for some reproductive traits (length at maturation and clutch size),
while mean clutch length only had effects for larger species D. magna and D. pulex (Figure 1). D.
mendotae was the only species that had an effect with food quality treatment on the length of
individuals at the end of the experiment (Figure 1).
Intraspecific trait variation and species-level responses were significantly positively
correlated (r2 = 0.89, t = 9.60, df = 22, p < 0.01) (Figure 2). Correlations conductedrun per species
found that D. magna and D. obtusa had significant correlations between intraspecific trait
variation and species-level responses (D. magna: r2 = 0.94, t = 5.51, df = 4, p < 0.001; D. obtusa:
r2 = 0.99, t = 12.151, df = 4, p < 0.001). There was no significant correlations detected when
running analyzing correlations per trait.
Discussion
The environment contributed most to life-history traits and species identity was the
largerexplained greater trait variation than genotype genetic contributor
A keystone of evolutionary theory is that trait variation can be separated into genetic and
environmental components; when a selection pressure is imposedimposes on a trait, the
environmental variance will dominate over genetic variance due to reduction in genetic variance
in the selection process (Spitze 1991). The food quality available in the environment had the
largest effect on life-history traits, accounting for 85% of the variance (Table 2). Food quality
affected all species current reproduction via clutch size, while it only had significant effects on
mean clutch length, which could have implications for fitness of future generations, for larger-
bodied D. magna and D. pulex. Food quality is known to play an important role in growth rate,
many studies have used the growth rate hypothesis to predict relationships between growth and P-
limited diets or environments (e.g., Jeyasingh 2007, Hood and Sterner 2014). P-limitation in
particular has been well studied in Daphnia; P-intensive processes including organismal growth,
rRNA levels, and therefore protein production, require high availability of phosphorus (Weider et
al. 2004).
Depending on intra- and inter-specific pressures, evolution will favor more or less
specialized individuals within a generalist population (Araújo et al. 2011). Within these
populations, clonal variation could lead to a wider environmental range in which the population
can maintain fitness under environmental change (Nunney 2015). Clonal lineages did not have a
large contribution to life-history traits, as predicted. This potentially could be due to the relatively
small number of clones per species. In addition, these experimental clonal assemblages are
somewhat of an artificial construct and raised in the lab, which may not reflect field populations.
It is enticing that species identity clustered strongly in terms of composite life-history traits (i.e.,
PC axes) under high quality (high P) food conditions, but there was no strong species-specific
clustering among three of the species under poor nutrient conditions (S2).
Trait variation in body size is constrained while there is flexibility in reproductive traits
The food quality levels from this study did not support the notion that smaller-bodied Daphnia
respond more to changes in food quality than larger-bodied Daphnia. However, larger Daphnia
did show more variation in life-history traits. Body size traits were associated with lower amounts
of intraspecific variation and species-level responses to food quality, while other reproductive
traits were associated with higher amounts of variation and responses to food quality (Figure 2).
This indicates that Daphnia have size-based phenotypes that are somewhat genetically
constrained. Allometric constraints may be one possible explanation for conserved morphological
traits. It has been shown that regardless of body-size, daphniids all follow a similar pattern of
resource allocation to growth and reproduction under different levels of food (carbon) quantity
(Dudycha & Lynch 2005).
Body size has been implicated in determining sensitivity to food quality, with larger
individuals being affected by low food quality more so than smaller individuals (Peter and
Lampert 1989). However there was no evidence in this study that the body-size of the species
played a role in species-level responses or the amount of intraspecific variation. Previous work has
indicated that Daphnia may face a competitive tradeoff between maximizing growth when food
quality is high and minimizing negative effects of poor food quality (Seidendorf et al. 2010, Hood
and Sterner 2014). However, stoichiometric flexibility may allow for changing the C:P ratio of
new growth under P-limited conditions in order to avoid consequences of P-limited diets. D.
mendotae is relatively inflexible compared to the other species in this study in its response to
changes in the C:P of its diet, showing strong homeostasis between diets (Hood and Sterner 2014).
This matches with this study’s results, where D. mendotae had overall less intraspecific variation
across traits, and smaller species-level responses (Figure 2).
We I hypothesized a tradeoff between intraspecific trait variation and species-level responses to
food stress. However, in this present study, results were contradictory to expectations: species showed
more change between food quality environments with increasing trait variation. This is most likely due to
reproductive traits being very P-intensive and very responsive to changes in food quality. In Daphnia, P
and reproductive trait relationships have not been as well studied as somatic growth rate (SGR), a well-
known proxy of fitness (Lampert & Trubetskova 1996). However, shifts toward lower reproduction has
been seen for low levels of nitrogen and phosphorus (Sterner et al. 1992) and for low food concentrations
(Lynch 1989); but under toxin-enriched environments, Daphnia have shown to maintain reproductive
output (Forbes et al. 2016). Plasticity in reproductive traits are generally considered less important in
changing population growth rates based on previous modeling of growth and reproductive schedules
(Pfister 1998). These results suggest that potentially environmental buffering from P-limitation has
canalized the highly vital growth traits over time, while leaving plasticity in reproductive rates variable
and responsive to environmental change. However, another potential explanation could be that a tradeoff
would not be expected in this case because these lineages have been raised in the lab for many
generations with bountiful resources, thereby creating a so-called “superflea” (Tessier #).Reznick et al.
2000). This study should be repeated using individuals taken from natural habitats.
Conclusions
This present study provides evidence that species identity is important in determining life-history traits,
but that may not translate into size-structured populations due to variation in reproductive traits across
environments that vary in overall food quality. In particular, the flexibility in reproductive traits may play
an important role for population persistence in the face of environmental change. Phenotypic plasticity is
the ability of an organism to change its phenotype in response to environmental change. Daphnia have
shown a great capacity for phenotypic plasticity in predator-avoidance (e.g., Spitze 1992; Weider &
Pijanowska 1993), nutrient uptake/use efficiency (e.g., Lampert 1994), and other life-history traits (e.g.,
Lampert 1993). This study, where a changing environment may select for more responsiveness in
reproductive traits, indicates more consideration of evolution of phenotypic plasticity and population
persistence through life-history traits (Chevin et al. 2010). Gathering information about the potential for
phenotypically plastic traits via trait variation has been, and will continue to be, a goal toward predicting a
species’ ability to respond to continued environmental stress. However, there are costs and limits involved
in maintaining plastic traits, including genetic and/or developmental constraints, competitive exclusion by
a more optimal (and less plastic) trait during a stable period, or geographical limits (Whitlock 1996,
Pigliucci 2005). Species that are flexible in their use of phosphorus may compensate for P-limitation by
being more plastic in reproductive life-history traits.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Michael Tobler):
The manuscript was re-assessed by two reviewers and both generally agree that the author has adequately
revised the manuscript. They provide some additional feedback that should help to improve the
manuscript. I would particularly like to echo two reviewer comments, one pertaining the clarification of
why a negative correlation between mean and variance are expected, and one pertaining the removal of
gray background in the figures. In the context of the latter, I should add that color figures are free, and
using color may help to make figure 2 more clear.
I have clarified this section of the introduction as to why I would expect a negative correlation between
trait variance and the expected amount of change in the trait. I do rely heavily on life-history theory
which does look at trait variation and sensitivity specifically. I am extrapolating that species-level
responses would be reflected by sensitivity in this case (which my equation for species-level responses
also reflects). But I have also added the alternative hypothesis as suggested (see line by line comments
below for more details).
I have also changed figure 2 as the two authors suggested. I now have a white background and used color
to improve the figure’s readability.
Please see line by line comments for each reviewer below.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors present a revised version of their manuscript in which they explore interspecific variation in
life history traits in response to nutritional environments. They have done well to eliminate the PC
analyses from the manuscript and focus instead on MANOVA analyses, which strengthen the overall
statistical approach. The findings are generally expected, but interesting. The overall comparative
approach is a strength.
Most of my critiques at this point are minor (see below). I would, however, like to see some effort spent
in clarifying the expectation that mean and variance in responses should be inverse correlated. Indeed, my
expectation for many biological traits is the opposite: that mean and variance in responses are generally
positively correlated. This ends up bearing somewhat heavily on the manuscript since this prediction is
introduced in the introduction and its implications are discussed in the discussion.
Thank you for reviewing this manuscript again, I really appreciate the time you put into this. Please see
my general comments to the editor for how I addressed your specific comment on the correlation between
species-level mean responses and intraspecific trait variation.

of this is a ‘floor effect’, for example. I would suggest discussing the alternative hypothesis (that mean
and variance are positively correlated) here.
Thank you for pointing out that I should have an alternative hypothesis, especially as I find evidence for
an alternative. I was not able to find a reference that directly has both species-level responses and
intraspecific trait variation in Daphnia, but I provide a reference that would reflect the positive
correlation between intraspecific trait variation and shifts in mean trait values.
Pg 6, Line 41: add ‘pond’ (?) after ‘ephemeral’
Added as suggested.
Pg 7, Line 26: what volume of algae (at 1mg C L^-1) was fed to the zooplankton?
The volume varied (between ~500-800microliters for HiP and ~500-1,200 microliters for LoP) depending
on the concentration of algae that day, The methods that explain how to calculate this volume will give
repeatability to the study. The volume was calculated each day using a spectrophometric method that
converted absorbance of chlorophyll to concentration of carbon. I modified the methods to make this
more clear.
Pg 9, Lines 3-4: Missing word(s) here?
Added “than” for clarification. “…less than five percent…”
Pg 9, Line 26: change ‘was run’ to ‘was conducted’ – also change this in future sentences, only because
‘was run’ sounds a bit awkward
Edited as suggested.
Pg 10, Line 54: Please make explicit the direction of effect here – larger species have greater degrees of
variation?
Added as suggested. “with larger species showing more variation than smaller species”
Pg 11, Lines 36-38: I suggest changing this heading so that it reads ‘[…] and species identity explained
greater trait variation than genotype’, or something along those lines.
Edited as suggested.

Comments to the Author(s)
I have a few minor comments that should be addressed for more transparency.
Introduction:
P5 L16 “therefore clonal variation may significantly add to genetic contributions”. The meaning of this
sentence is cryptic, can you try to reformulate?
Edited as suggested.
Methods
P6 L40 I think one word is missing in the sentence “finnish pond from a ephemeral with dessication”
Edited as suggested (pond was added after ephemeral).
“incidental ambient lighting”: I suppose not only the stock culture but also the experiment were in these
conditions.
Added that experimental animals also received ambient lighting for clarification.
When was the experiment conducted?
The starting date for the experiment were added for clarity.
Please provide more details about spectrophotometer measurements: wavelength, and perhaps a reference
to the literature on this already established procedure?
Added reference as suggested and also added spectrophotometer details and which wavelengths were
measured.
Please provide details about the experimental animals. Especially in smaller species, a single clutch
contains less than 20 neonates, so to reach the indicated number clutches must have been pooled. Were all
experimental animals born on the same day from different mothers, or were they all from the same mother
but born on different days? I am aware this is a logistical issue but also important when interpreting
results, because it influences the observed variance.
Animals were pooled from multiple mothers, and accounted for in the MANOVA. I have added a line in
the methods to specify that animals were pooled from different mothers.

P9 word missing “mortality accounts for less than five percent…”
Edited as suggested.
P13 (middle) replace “we hypothesize” with “I hypothesize”
Edited as suggested.
P14 The superflea Tessier reference is incomplete, I suppose it was a formatting error.
Thank you for pointing this out. I was missing the correct citation in this reference. This has been
updated.
There is no R code available in supp Mat, please provide it.
Thank you for pointing this out. Code has been added to the zip file in the datadryad submission
associated with this manuscript (with updates to figure modification).
Figure 2 is hard to read. Please consider using a white background, as grey on grey is not easy. Is RSOS
having a limitation on color figures? If not I would consider using colors in this figure, because even if
“only” 4 shades of grey aren’t much, it is a bit hard. I also wish the symbols were larger, and I am
wondering why the symbols for mean clutch size look different in shape?
Edited as suggested. Figure 2 now has a white background, different shapes for the species and different
colors for the traits. Making the symbols larger caused overlap that made interpretation near the bottom
left corner difficult.
