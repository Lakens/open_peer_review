This article studies differences in morphology and in sound frequency within communities of
barbets from different regions. Its conclusions are that divergence in morphology, likely due to
ecological niche partitioning within communities, may explain differences in acoustic signals.
The conclusions are interesting since there are not many articles examining community structure
in acoustic signals. But the article ignores most of the work that does exist on this topic. For
example, Kirschel et al. (2008 PNAS) is cited as the “first example of character displacement in
acoustic signals”, but several previous examples exist (e.g. Walin 1986 Ibis, Doutrelant &
Lambrechts 2001 Ethology, Seddon 2005 Evolution; see also Kroodsma 1985 Behav Ecol Sociobiol,
Naugler & Ratcliffe 1994 J Avian Biol).
The authors also do not discuss previous work on community structure of avian acoustic signals,
some of which found evidence for partitioning of acoustic space (Luther 2008 Biol Lett, 2009
Behav Ecol), and some of which found that acoustic partitioning does not occur (Cardoso & Price
2010 Evol Ecol, Tobias et al. 2014 PNAS), which is central to the goals of this article. These papers
use methods than may be useful as examples on how to test partition of phenotypic spaces within
communities.
As noted below, I have doubts on the methods used, and some of them are not explained
sufficiently for me to be able to evaluate.
Main comments by line number:
Title and elsewhere: I think that “stratification” is not a good word. It implies hierarchy, while the
phenomenon here is about non-hierarchical partitioning of the acoustic space.
103 – This is a very important aspect of the methods and I think it needs to be explained in the
main text. If there are space constraints, the approach should at lest be summarized and justified
here. As the manuscript stands, readers will not be able to understand later sections of the
methods (e.g. lines 128-130, 449-453). If there are no space constraints, then all methods should be
in the main text rather than as supplements.
119-122 – This is an insufficient description of the quantification of acoustic traits. Which traits
were measured, why, and with which method (stating the software is not a surrogate for stating
and justifying the method)? Also, which criteria were used to select call recordings, are there
issues with some species having different call types (e.g. song vs contact calls), can you provide
evidence or a rationale for the sound samples being enough to represent each species?
The explanations in the supplementary material raise some issues. “Peak frequency” is
consistently defined in the literature as the frequency of highest amplitude, but the method
described in the supplementary material does not agree with this. Also the method description is
very laconic: where was the cursor placed in cases where there are frequency modulations or
broadband sounds (or don’t these problems apply to barbet vocalizations)? What does it mean
“to outline each element”? Do these vocalizations have multiple elements, and how was this dealt
with?
3
167 – This line gives statistical results (incompletely reported: only P values!) that was not
anticipated in the methods, nor in the supplementary materials. As it stands, readers do not
understand what statistical test was done prior to these post-hoc comparisons.
Also, reading this paragraph and the legend to figure 3, I still do not understand how to interpret
the “black and blue asterisks”.
173-179 – These analyses were not anticipated in the methods, nor are there explanations of the
statistic tests used. The same questions I wrote on lines 119-122 and 167 apply here too.
182-186 – This essentially repeats what had been stated in the methods (lines 128-131). Here, in
the methods, and in the supplementary material, it was not explained how phylogenetic distance
was computed, and whether it is an accepted procedure to simply correlate DOij with
phylogenetic distances among all co-ocurring species pairs. To me this procedure seems incorrect
because it considers each species pair as an independent data point (which I think is wrong
because each individual species contributes to many different points), and because this is not a
phylogenetic test. The procedure needs to be much better argued and, if it has been used in the
literature, this should be noted.
If I understood well, what is being tested here is very similar to testing if community composition
has phylogenetic signal. Perhaps a simpler and more standard approach would be to treat
geographic location as a phenotype, and test the phylogenetic signal of geographic location?
270 – Correct. So, why were temporal traits (e.g. song duration) not studied in addition to
frequency? The choice of acoustic traits was not justified in the methods, and this discussion
suggests that additional traits should have been studied as well.
278 – This is one of the main conclusions of the paper, also prominent in the abstract. But it is
based on very indirect evidence (lower phylogenetic signal for morphology than for sound
frequency). More direct evidence would be based on the actual distribution of phenotypes within
communities. Perhaps check the papers cited above (Luther, Cardoso & Price, and Tobias et al.)
for examples of statistical approaches to test for partitioning in phenotypic space within
communities.
Supplementary materials:
- Not clear what is the statistical unit: each separate recording, or each measurement (up to 10 per
recording).
- “Null matrices” mentioned in relation to the DOij, but it is not explained there or in the main
text what those mean, or what they are used for.
- Not sure if the discussion about Pagel’s lambda is needed, since it was not used.
- “The tips of the phylogenetic tree were shuffled randomly 1000 times” is not an accurate
description. Does this mean shuffling phenotypes on an unchanging phylogeny, or actually
changing part of the phylogeny (“tips”).
Other comments:
Abstract and line 84 – incessant is perhaps excessive…
35-37 – Unclear. The second statement (36-37) appears to contradict the first statement (35-36).
40-42 – It would be better to note what the opinion is based on.
54 – Very vague statement; connection with sentence in the following line is not apparent.
4
71-72 – Not sure I understand this sentence: shared habitat preferences helps species to co-exist?
Shouldn’t this cause increased competition? Maybe explain better.
116 – Unclear. What does it mean “log-transforming the collated measurements”? Trasnforming
first and averaging per species afterwards (which is correct), or averaging first and log-
transforming afterwards (which is not so correct). Please explain.
117 – Please state the purpose of this PCA.
188 – Statistical results in table 2 are insufficiently reported (sample sizes or degrees of freedom
are missing).
191 – Much of this results section reads more like methods or discussion text.
263 – I do not understand how the previous sentences lead to this conclusion about sound and
mate quality.
272-276 – This is perhaps off-topic?
287-288– This is not always the case. It could easily have been tested here for barbet species.

Overall, I find this to be an interesting topic and a thought-provoking study. The finding that
Asian barbets demonstrate acoustic and ecological niche partitioning is very interesting. It is also
interesting that there are three clear size classes, consistent with other model organisms of
speciation research (e.g. ground finches and Wallacea’s bats (Kingston & Rossiter Nature 2004)), a
general pattern which receives no discussion. However, I do not recommend this manuscript for
publication in its current form. Below I highlight a number of major and minor issues which
should be addressed to make this study stronger and more impactful.

Specific Comments:
The citations in the intro seem shallow, and somewhat obscure. For example, in addition to/in
lieu of citation [4], numerous broader works would seem relevant (e.g. work by Mayr, Speciation
by Coyne & Orr, Ecological Speciation by Nosil, Speciation in Birds by Price)
Line 57: This is incorrect; there were several examples of acoustic character displacement from
crickets and frogs (cited in Kirschel et al 2009). Kirschel et al was the first example for birds.
Lines 59-61: For a general topic journal like Royal Society Open Science, I feel broader
generalizations should be made beyond birds, where appropriate. Here, this scaling relationship
between size and frequency has been shown across diverse animal groups (e.g. Gillooly & Ophir
Proc B 2010).
Line 62: This is not a novel prediction. There are several relevant papers and concepts related
here which should be recognized; in particular, this concept is similar to acoustic space (sensu
Nelson and Marler, Comparative Perception Vol 2, 1990), extended in the acoustic window
concept (Wilkins et al 2013). Moreover, it has been tested in bird communities (Luther, Behavioral
Ecology 2009), substrate-signaling lacewings (Henry & Wells, Animal Behavior 2010) and bats
(Kingston & Rossiter Nature 2004), and probably other groups. Additionally, a recent study
showed the opposite pattern of increased signal similarity among co-occurring species (Tobias et
al, PNAS 2014); moreover, sometimes such increased signal similarity may be accommodated by
increased perceptual acuity (Tobias & Seddon Evolution 2009, Amezquita et al PNAS 2011).
Framing the current study better, in the context of this previous work, will make it easier to
recognize the gap it fills in our understanding of acoustic signal evolution.
Line 65-67: Acoustic signal divergence need not be adaptive. Several studies now show
divergence through neutral cultural and genetic drift. Moreover, sexual selection is known to
have a huge effect on signal evolution in numerous taxa…this is a glaring omission in the
background and framing of the paper. Clearly, the study does not focus on sexual selection, but
its role in signal evolution should be acknowledged.
Line 71-72: “Conversely…” I don’t follow this reasoning…shared habitat preferences will only
allow coexistence if there is sufficient divergence in ecology and/or mate preferences…this is not
in and of itself sufficient for species coexistence.
Line 74-77: The logic of this hypothesis is flawed. Species distributions are inherently stochastic,
due to numerous historical and ecological factors. One would not expect likelihood of co-
occurrence to accrue linearly with time/genetic divergence. For example, strong divergent
selection may drive some populations to evolve very different morphology or mating preferences
in a short amount of time (e.g. rapid speciation shown in swordtail crickets, marine and
freshwater stickleback, African cichlids, etc), allowing for coexistence; in contrast, highly
genetically divergent species may sometimes mate readily, leading to hybridization. Also, highly
divergent species may competitively exclude each other if they compete for the same niche (e.g.
any invasive species vs native species). As such, no relationship between phylogenetic
relatedness and co-occurrence should be expected. If such a pattern (particularly a linear
relationship) were found, this would be extremely surprising, and difficult to explain.
6
As currently framed, I don’t see that this straw-man hypothesis or its refutation contributes to the
manuscript.
Line 84-85: Reasons why incessant, highly stereotyped calls and a cryptic habit are good qualities
for this study should be explicitly stated. (Because of recording logistics, relevance to the species’
natural history, or some other reason?)
Line 116: Please indicate why log-transformation was employed.
Line 127: Citation for ‘picante’ should be [18]; the R Base Package needs its own citation.
Line 129: Please explain more about the DOij metric: briefly, does it have a descriptive name?
How is it calculated, what is its range, and how might it be interpreted?
Line 131 and elsewhere: “co-efficient” does not need a hyphen
Line 131-132: Discussion of why Blomberg’s K is used, rather than Pagel’s lambda should be
moved here from the supplement. This is important detail.
Paragraph beginning with line 140: What criterion was used to extract PC axes? If PC1 explains
88% of the variation, PC2 may not be worth including. The Eigenvalues should be reported for
these axes in Table 1.
Also, from Table 1, PC1 and PC2 have very similar loadings for several of the traits, making the
distinction between the two difficult to interpret. It is inaccurate to say that PC1 indicates size and
PC2 shape; PC1 loads higher on beak depth than PC2, and PC2 loads higher for tail length than
PC1. If PC2 does explain significant phenotypic variation (i.e. eigenvalue over 1), I would
recommend using varimax rotation to increase the interpretability of these axes (that is, maximize
the difference in trait loadings on the two factors). Having more interpretable differences
between axes would make the plots in figure 2 much more informative.
Lines 149-151: PC2 is listed twice
Line 167: I have a hard time assessing significant differences from this figure. Might consider
letters above boxplots to show the results of post-hoc tests.
Line 183: Rather than a correlation, one might expect a threshold effect of phylogenetic
relationship on species co-existence (essentially a phylogenetic species concept based on a certain
level of differentiation required for post-mating isolation).
Line 184: “We calculated…” Unnecessary, since previously stated in methods.
Line 188: To me it would seem more interesting to show these plots, rather than test for a
correlation, and to assess whether there is in fact a threshold level of differentiation for “good
species” coexistence.
Line 211-212: This is an inaccurate portrayal of the literature. The classic model of speciation
(Darwin, Mayr) is through allopatric ecological divergence. This is certainly not a new
development.
Lines 216-218: Seems disconnected. Why is this relevant information?
Lines 218-220: This is actually really cool! I wonder if you were to look through the literature at
speciation studies, how often you might find a pattern of three such size classes forming during
species radiations. Certainly this is famously the case with Galapagos ground finches.
7
Line 228: Why might this be the case? Some sort of interpretation would link this to the next
paragraph better.
Line 262-264: As stated previously, given the known importance of sexual selection in vocal
signal evolution, it should be more incorporated in the introduction and discussion.
Line 265 & 269: Uy and Safran 2013 is a very relevant reference here, addressing this general
principle.
274-276: Seems a little off-topic. Also, I think paragraph should end with some summary
statement, helping assimilate all this discussion.
291-293: Why? What exactly will be gained from such an investigation?
300-301: Reinforcement is a process that could increase species discrimination and signal
divergence. Species recognition itself is not a driver of signal divergence.
302-307: I think the reader does not need to be convinced that this is a fascinating system. This is
clear. Instead, I would be interested to know more about how this fits in with other systems and
broad patterns of signal divergence, especially given recently demonstrated opposite patterns in
South American birds (Tobias et al 2014). Why might these patterns differ? If it’s unclear, how can
we answer that question?

distinction between the two difficult to interpret. It is inaccurate to say that PC1 indicates size and
PC2 shape; PC1 loads higher on beak depth than PC2, and PC2 loads higher for tail length than
PC1. If PC2 does explain significant phenotypic variation (i.e. eigenvalue over 1), I would
recommend using varimax rotation to increase the interpretability of these axes (that is, maximize
the difference in trait loadings on the two factors). Having more interpretable differences
between axes would make the plots in figure 2 much more informative.
13
Lines 149-151: PC2 is listed twice
Line 167: I have a hard time assessing significant differences from this figure. Might consider
letters above boxplots to show the results of post-hoc tests.
Line 183: Rather than a correlation, one might expect a threshold effect of phylogenetic
relationship on species co-existence (essentially a phylogenetic species concept based on a certain
level of differentiation required for post-mating isolation).
Line 184: “We calculated…” Unnecessary, since previously stated in methods.
Line 188: To me it would seem more interesting to show these plots, rather than test for a
correlation, and to assess whether there is in fact a threshold level of differentiation for “good
species” coexistence.
Line 211-212: This is an inaccurate portrayal of the literature. The classic model of speciation
(Darwin, Mayr) is through allopatric ecological divergence. This is certainly not a new
development.
Lines 216-218: Seems disconnected. Why is this relevant information?
Lines 218-220: This is actually really cool! I wonder if you were to look through the literature at
speciation studies, how often you might find a pattern of three such size classes forming during
species radiations. Certainly this is famously the case with Galapagos ground finches.
Line 228: Why might this be the case? Some sort of interpretation would link this to the next
paragraph better.
Line 262-264: As stated previously, given the known importance of sexual selection in vocal
signal evolution, it should be more incorporated in the introduction and discussion.
Line 265 & 269: Uy and Safran 2013 is a very relevant reference here, addressing this general
principle.
274-276: Seems a little off-topic. Also, I think paragraph should end with some summary
statement, helping assimilate all this discussion.
291-293: Why? What exactly will be gained from such an investigation?
300-301: Reinforcement is a process that could increase species discrimination and signal
divergence. Species recognition itself is not a driver of signal divergence.
302-307: I think the reader does not need to be convinced that this is a fascinating system. This is
clear. Instead, I would be interested to know more about how this fits in with other systems and
broad patterns of signal divergence, especially given recently demonstrated opposite patterns in
South American birds (Tobias et al 2014). Why might these patterns differ? If it’s unclear, how can
we answer that question?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
This revised version generally improved the clarity of explanations. For example, the
introduction reads very well, and the descriptions and results of the tests of phylogenetic
structure are clear also.
However, several statistical problems remain, and the most important conclusions of the paper
are based on visual inspection of plots with no statistical testing (see main comments below). As a
result, the main conclusions of the article partitioning in morphological and acoustic space (e.g.
lines 34, 37-41, 340-341) are unfounded, and the discussion is excessively speculative.
Main comments, by line number:
233-234 – This is statistically incorrect. Measurements of different element in a phrase are not
statistically independent, and measurement of different phrases in a recording are just repeated
measurements of the same thing. I would think that measurements should be averaged and each
recording be a statistical unit.
15
The reply letter makes it clear that each measurement is a statistically unit (which is incorrect),
but the manuscript is more vague, both here and in later parts (e.g. figures report N both as
number of elements and number of recordings).
291-301 – This results paragraph is only descriptive, based on plotting species values on graphs,
with no use of statistic tests.
The previous section correctly makes use of statistics for testing phylogenetic clustering in
communities. This section too needs to use statistic test in order to understand if communities are
random in relation to morphology, or clustered, or overdispersed. We should not take
conclusions based only on screening plots.
307 – Unlike stated here, I see plenty of overlap in frequency between sympatric species in most
panels of Figure 4.
Again, this paragraph in lines 304 to 311 takes conclusions without statistical tests.
312-320 (also lines 238-243) – The tests reported here are inadequate to support the claims about
acoustic partitioning or acoustic structuring. These are simple tests of whether there are
frequency differences among species (it would be very strange if there were no differences among
species, even if small). Getting at the idea of acoustic partitioning or acoustic structuring needs
much more: it needs statistical testing (e.g. randomization tests) that tell us whether communities
are random in relation to the sound frequency, or clustered, or overdispersed. This is the same
problem as in the previous section (see comment on lines 291-301).
Other comments:
80-87 - It is interesting reading these lines that almost all papers finding evidence for acoustic
partitioning worked with closely related species (e.g. references 25 to 35). The papers that do not
find evidence for acoustic partitioning deal with taxonomically diverse assemblages (refs 38, 39).
Perhaps acoustic partitioning is needed for closely related taxa, but not so much for more
distantly related taxa, whose signals would have diverged a lot already? This point might be
relevant for this article study, since it focuses on closely related species.
96,97 – A bit unclear what “trait patterns” mean here. Please make this more explicit.
99 – “and” or “or”?
100 – Again, it is unclear what is meant by “patters of trait evolution” here. Please make this
explicit. See also comment on line 245.
126 – The expression “repetition rate” is usually used in the literature to mean how fast or how
slow songs or song elements are repeated. This does not seems to be the meaning here, but rather
that repetition is common (not referring specifically to how fast or slow it is). Thus, consider
avoiding the expression “repetition rate”.
204, 205 – This is correct, morphological measurements should be log-transformed because of
allometric scaling. But, for the same reasons, sound frequency should have been log-transformed
too: the relation between sound frequency and morphology is linearized in log-log plots and,
unlike linear frequency, log frequency quantifies differences in sound perception and production
in a comparable way across the frequency range (Cardoso 2013 Animal Behaviour).
230 – Please replace “delineate each element” by a more detailed description of what is done. The
word “delineate” may suggest that the frequencies were measured manually, using the on-screen
cursor (this is what I thought reading the previous version of the methods). But, after reading the
16
next sentence in this version, it appears that the frequency of maximum amplitude was instead
automatically measured by Luscinia. Is this correct? Please make it clear if peak frequency was
measured using the on-screen cursor (and in that case need to give more details/justifications), if
the cursor was only used to identify start and end point of elements, or if this is an intermediate
situation (e.g. the cursor limits the frequency range of sound that Luscinia then uses to find peak
frequency).
233 – Since you use the term “peak frequency” and define it, it is unnecessary, and perhaps a bit
confusing, to also refer to the synonym term “dominant frequency” here.
238-243 – It was difficult for me to understand the rationale for these statistical tests, because they
only use a small part of the recordings (those with more than 1 species vocalizing), and statistical
analyses using the majority of recordings are not described. (Later on I understood that no
statisticl analyses were made on those other recordings, only plotting; see comment on line 307).
Need to describe these statistical analyses together with an explanation of the rationale for them
(this is only stated later on in the results section; lines 312 onwards), and how they fit together
with the main analyses of the other recordings.
Also, it is not clear why only a subset of recordings (those with multiple species) was used for
this. The methods previously described how you defined barbet communities, and this test
ignores that previous work, instead simply using the set of species that happen to be in a
recording. Why?
245 – After reading this section, I understand that what is referred elsewhere by “patterns of trait
evolution” is simply “phylogenetic signal”. So, perhaps phrasing throughout the article, and also
the name of this section, should be changed simply to “phylogenetic signal”. Writing of
“evolutionary patterns” is vague and suggests broader analyses that what was actually done.
282-290 – This categorical classification of specimens size was not anticipated in the methods.
What is the objective of categorizing size? why not to treat it as a continuous variable (as
apparently described in the methods)?
330-333 – Interesting result that closely related species are more divergent in morphology that
expected by chance (i.e. than expected by Brownian motion). But this test does not take into
account whether sympatry has an effect on this divergence or not. So, this result does not cover
for the above criticisms (see comments on lines 291-301, 312-320).

Krishnan and Tamma have done a laudable job with this revision of their manuscript! This
version is much clearer in terms of the overall hypothesis-testing framework, summary of the
relevant literature, and explanation of the methodological approach. This work provides a clear
example of the intersection of ecological adaptation and signal evolution in community assembly
and I expect it to be an influential paper in the acoustics and speciation literature. Below I
indicate a few suggestions for further improvements to the manuscript.
Line 77: Sympatric signalers… This sentence doesn’t flow well from the previous sentence. I
think it would be good to say explicitly that in this study you’re not directly testing the drivers of
signal divergence, but attempting to identify broader patterns of community structure. e.g.
Regardless of which taxon-specific factors drive signal evolution, sympatric signalers compete for
acoustic space [18], and signals with similar… or some other phrase linking the two sentences.
Line 88: I think the new paragraph should begin here.
Line 94: “, albeit…” phrase unnecessary; redundant.
Line 182: DOij is robust to what?
Line 181 and elsewhere: i and j should be subscripts
Line 261: “was determined by comparison to these trees” is unnecessarily vague. Please specify,
e.g. was calculated as the fraction of 1000 iterations w/ K = the observed value.
Line 290: specify Figure 3A. Also, if you could distinguish these points of interest (P. monticola)
with a different color or shape, it would be helpful. I’m assuming some individuals were in
classes II and III?
Line 350: I recommend changing “allopatry; species thus” to “allopatry, in which case species
already”
Line 406-7: This study doesn’t fully support your assertion, as it doesn’t compare temporal vs
frequency partitioning.
Line 416: What does song variability mean? Rate, structure, diel timing?
Paragraph beginning 429: This is a bit redundant with previous results & intro, and could be cut
down a lot for conciseness.
Line 455: Give a bit more context for this example—how many species were involved? How
many size classes (i.e how is it similar or dissimilar to your study exactly?)
Line 458: “Our comparative analysis…” this does not flow from the tinkerbird example—how
does your study compare to Kirschel’s? How are they different and why might that be?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_6
In this revision the authors slightly rephrase conclusions (e.g. dropping the word partitioning
and instead writing of species differences), and argue that the lack of statistical testing is not
important in this article. The argument is mostly based on the descriptive results being clear, on
previous papers having provided descriptive results of a similar nature, and on working with
small communities making statistical testing difficult (see comments below).
Given the few changes to the manuscript, my appreciation is similar to the previous version. The
main results are summarized in this sentence from the abstract:
“We report that sympatric assemblages of Asian barbets (frugivorous canopy birds) consist of a
random phylogenetic sample of species, but are divergent in both morphological and acoustic
traits.”
The first part of the sentence is well-founded, as the authors used tests of phylogenetic structure.
The second part of the sentence is unfounded, unless the observed differences among same-
community species are tested and shown to be larger than random.
I agree with the authors that some of the descriptive results, illustrated in the figures, are clear.
But others are not, as the authors now acknowledge in the revised figure 4. Clarity of descriptive
figures should not be a reason for not conducting statistical tests, but a motivation to show those
differences statistically.
I agree that other papers have provided similar descriptive results. In some of the cited papers,
however, those descriptive results were a minor part of the paper, or were then used as data to
conduct statistically-based hypothesis-testing. Here the description of within-community
differences is the end point of the article, which renders this weakness more relevant.
24
I do not agree with a reply stating that small communities make it difficult to apply statistical
tests. The methods used in some of the papers mentioned in a previous round of review can be,
and have been, applied to communities with few species. Statistical tests can be very simple: for
example, computing a metric of within-community dissimilarity (perhaps mean Cohen’s d,
which uses a metric already computed in the paper; or perhaps another metric), and then
comparing it to a distribution of the same metric obtained from randomly re-assigning species to
communities many times (while keeping community size the same as the original).
p.s.: Please note that this review was based mostly on reading the reply letter.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
In this revision the authors slightly rephrase conclusions (e.g. dropping the word partitioning
and instead writing of species differences), and argue that the lack of statistical testing is not
important in this article. The argument is mostly based on the descriptive results being clear, on
previous papers having provided descriptive results of a similar nature, and on working with
small communities making statistical testing difficult (see comments below).
Given the few changes to the manuscript, my appreciation is similar to the previous version. The
main results are summarized in this sentence from the abstract:
“We report that sympatric assemblages of Asian barbets (frugivorous canopy birds) consist of a
random phylogenetic sample of species, but are divergent in both morphological and acoustic
traits.”
The first part of the sentence is well-founded, as the authors used tests of phylogenetic structure.
The second part of the sentence is unfounded, unless the observed differences among same-
community species are tested and shown to be larger than random.
I agree with the authors that some of the descriptive results, illustrated in the figures, are clear.
But others are not, as the authors now acknowledge in the revised figure 4. Clarity of descriptive
figures should not be a reason for not conducting statistical tests, but a motivation to show those
differences statistically.
I agree that other papers have provided similar descriptive results. In some of the cited papers,
however, those descriptive results were a minor part of the paper, or were then used as data to
27
conduct statistically-based hypothesis-testing. Here the description of within-community
differences is the end point of the article, which renders this weakness more relevant.
I do not agree with a reply stating that small communities make it difficult to apply statistical
tests. The methods used in some of the papers mentioned in a previous round of review can be,
and have been, applied to communities with few species. Statistical tests can be very simple: for
example, computing a metric of within-community dissimilarity (perhaps mean Cohen’s d,
which uses a metric already computed in the paper; or perhaps another metric), and then
comparing it to a distribution of the same metric obtained from randomly re-assigning species to
communities many times (while keeping community size the same as the original).
p.s.: Please note that this review was based mostly on reading the reply letter.

I read this revised version of the manuscript and think it is in good shape. It is interesting and
well argued, makes good use of the literature, and I find the findings well supported and
interpreted sensibly. Below I only note some minor comments and corrections.
Abstract and final statements of the introduction – A missing piece of information that, it appears
to me, would make readers understand better the conclusion that song divergence is a mostly a
side-effect of morphological divergence, is that body size and sound frequency are correlated in
barbets. This is only mentioned later in the discussion. Consider noting this also in the abstract
and concluding statements of the intro.
84, 85, also 478 – It is the other way around, I think: species in less complex communities, not
more complex communities, have larger song variability; the character release hypothesis. See
also Morinay et al 2013 Ecol Evol for a similar result.
132 – Could make this statement more precise; “phylogenetic comparative methods to
understand evolutionary patterns” is very vague…
178 – I do not understand this statement. It does not make sense that range sizes are of the order
of magnitude of 0.2 degrees. Could explain better to avoid confusion by readers.
233 – Good paragraph. But perhaps it does not need to be in a separate section? Could be part of
the first paragraph in the following section…
342 – Since in the previous line Z values were reported, perhaps report both Z and P here too for
consistency.
388 and Table 3 – It is strange that these three p values all the same (0.001), since K is very
different from 1 in the first two cases, but very similar to 1 in the third. Please check this (perhaps
you meant <0.001 instead?).
499 – Maybe rephrase here (and in the abstract also) to something like “are close to the expected

s is a timely (with the phylogeny out) paper that addresses some interesting questions. Asian
es are often neglected in niche diversification/divergence research, and this paper is a
uable contribution. The paper also shows strong and interesting pattern of little overlap in

tains both general and specific comments.
not too familiar with this journal, Royal Society Open Science. Assuming it’s an online only

arder for readers since they have to flip to both sections (main section and SM) to understand
methods. The supplementary methods sections is only 4.5 pages long (double spaced) and
ld easily fit inside the main text. Also, the SM do not contain line numbers, making it harder

ally via long isolation (and drift) and/or reinforcement. The Darwin’s finches [ref 4] is a very

ciation and signal divergence work in general. The authors should also venture beyond just

Comments to the Author:
Three reviewers have commented on your manuscript. Their advice identifies many
points within your manuscript that require some significant reworking, and at this stage, I
am unable to judge whether the work is sound. If you decide to resubmit this, please
address all of the comments raised by the reviewers.
We thank the reviewers for their constructive criticisms and detailed feedback. In light of
the feedback provided, we have extensively reworked the introduction and discussion of
our manuscript, to include the literature suggestions from all three reviewers and frame
our findings better. We have also consolidated the main and supplementary methods,
included an additional figure, and provided clarifications on our choice of analyses (with
expanded literature review where necessary including papers that have used similar
techniques) to address the comments of the reviewers. Below is our point-by-point
response (in blue) to the reviewers’ comments, where we have discussed in detail the
clarifications and changes we have made to the manuscript.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This article studies differences in morphology and in sound frequency within
communities of barbets from different regions. Its conclusions are that divergence in
morphology, likely due to ecological niche partitioning within communities, may explain
differences in acoustic signals.
The conclusions are interesting since there are not many articles examining community
structure in acoustic signals. But the article ignores most of the work that does exist on
this topic. For example, Kirschel et al. (2008 PNAS) is cited as the “first example of
character displacement in acoustic signals”, but several previous examples exist (e.g.
Walin 1986 Ibis, Doutrelant & Lambrechts 2001 Ethology, Seddon 2005 Evolution; see
also Kroodsma 1985 Behav Ecol Sociobiol, Naugler & Ratcliffe 1994 J Avian Biol).
The authors also do not discuss previous work on community structure of avian acoustic
signals, some of which found evidence for partitioning of acoustic space (Luther 2008
Biol Lett, 2009 Behav Ecol), and some of which found that acoustic partitioning does not
occur (Cardoso & Price 2010 Evol Ecol, Tobias et al. 2014 PNAS), which is central to
the goals of this article. These papers use methods than may be useful as examples on
how to test partition of phenotypic spaces within communities.
We have included discussion of the above literature into the introduction of our paper,
and have significantly reworked the layout of the introduction to include suggestions
from all reviewers.
As noted below, I have doubts on the methods used, and some of them are not explained
sufficiently for me to be able to evaluate.
We have provided clarifications at each point, listed below.
Main comments by line number:
Title and elsewhere: I think that “stratification” is not a good word. It implies hierarchy,
while the phenomenon here is about non-hierarchical partitioning of the acoustic space.
We have replaced the word “stratification” with either “structuring” or “partitioning”,
both in the title and throughout the text, depending on the context in which the word is
used.
103 – This is a very important aspect of the methods and I think it needs to be explained
in the main text. If there are space constraints, the approach should at lest be summarized
and justified here. As the manuscript stands, readers will not be able to understand later
sections of the methods (e.g. lines 128-130, 449-453). If there are no space constraints,
then all methods should be in the main text rather than as supplements.
We have consolidated the main and supplementary methods within the main text, as
suggested by all reviewers. The supplementary material now solely contains the
supplementary tables.
119-122 – This is an insufficient description of the quantification of acoustic traits.
Which traits were measured, why, and with which method (stating the software is not a
surrogate for stating and justifying the method)? Also, which criteria were used to select
call recordings, are there issues with some species having different call types (e.g. song
vs contact calls), can you provide evidence or a rationale for the sound samples being
enough to represent each species?
We have consolidated the main and supplementary methods, including our trait
measurements and the selection of call recordings. Barbet vocalizations are highly
stereotyped (Figure 2), and their advertisement vocalizations are loud, repetitive and
carry great distances. Every species of Asian barbet has a distinct, stereotyped phrase
structure that is “essentially species-specific” (Horne and Short 2002). These calls may
be given for up to 9 months of the year, and often throughout the day (and even at night).
Based on the literature, these advertisement vocalizations thus appear to be the primary
form of long-range acoustic communication in barbets. We have included these points in
the introduction.
The explanations in the supplementary material raise some issues. “Peak frequency” is
consistently defined in the literature as the frequency of highest amplitude, but the
method described in the supplementary material does not agree with this. Also the
method description is very laconic: where was the cursor placed in cases where there are
frequency modulations or broadband sounds (or don’t these problems apply to barbet
vocalizations)? What does it mean “to outline each element”? Do these vocalizations
have multiple elements, and how was this dealt with?
By ‘peak frequency’, we did, in fact, mean the frequency of the highest amplitude. We
have clarified this in the Methods section. Drewry and Rand (1983) showed that
frequency parameters were important in avoiding masking interference, a key aspect of
our study. We have included a citation of this paper as justification for our choice of
frequency as a trait. The species analyzed here do not produce broadband calls.
Additionally, only a few species produce shallow frequency modulations as part of the
“trill” component of their repetitive phrases (which also still, however, have a peak
frequency where their output is loudest). By “outline”, we meant to delineate each
element of a vocalization using the cursors (Luscinia has functions that do so, similar to
other acoustics/birdsong analysis software), and then calculating trait parameters; we
have changed the text to reflect this, and added more detail. To maintain consistency
across species, we delineated each element of a repetitive phrase (see Figure 2 for
examples), and calculated the peak frequency of that element. Each element formed a
data point in the plots shown, so as to capture as much variation in the acoustic signals as
possible. We have indicated this in the text of the methods.
167 – This line gives statistical results (incompletely reported: only P values!) that was
not anticipated in the methods, nor in the supplementary materials. As it stands, readers
do not understand what statistical test was done prior to these post-hoc comparisons.
Also, reading this paragraph and the legend to figure 3, I still do not understand how to
interpret the “black and blue asterisks”.
173-179 – These analyses were not anticipated in the methods, nor are there explanations
of the statistic tests used. The same questions I wrote on lines 119-122 and 167 apply
here too.
We have added a description of the statistical tests in the methods. For the second
section, we have reported the values of the test statistics in the supplementary table S2,
and have also indicated this in the main text. Additionally, we have revised Figure 3 (now
4), and the text now explains that this figure represents the range of frequencies that each
species within a community occupies, in keeping with studies on frog and cricket
communities. From there, we conclude that sympatric species occupy distinct regions of
frequency space, and then proceed to conduct a statistical analysis of whether
simultaneously vocalizing species occupy different frequencies using the next section
(now Figure 5 and Table S2). We have amended the Methods, Results and figure legends
accordingly.
182-186 – This essentially repeats what had been stated in the methods (lines 128-131).
Here, in the methods, and in the supplementary material, it was not explained how
phylogenetic distance was computed, and whether it is an accepted procedure to simply
correlate DOij with phylogenetic distances among all co-ocurring species pairs. To me
this procedure seems incorrect because it considers each species pair as an independent
data point (which I think is wrong because each individual species contributes to many
different points), and because this is not a phylogenetic test. The procedure needs to be
much better argued and, if it has been used in the literature, this should be noted.
If I understood well, what is being tested here is very similar to testing if community
composition has phylogenetic signal. Perhaps a simpler and more standard approach
would be to treat geographic location as a phenotype, and test the phylogenetic signal of
geographic location?
The phylogenetic distance is a cophenetic distance, which is calculated within the
functions we used. This is the height of a dendrogram where the two objects merge into a
single branch. We have indicated as such in the methods. We have amended the results to
avoid repeating the methods section. Correlating co-occurrence with phylogenetic
relatedness to obtain a metric of phylogenetic structure is a standard technique used in
many studies of community phylogeny (for example, Dinnage 2009, Cavender-Bares et
al 2004). The co-occurrence of a species with one species can be considered as
independent of its co-occurrence with another, thus making each pairwise comparison an
independent data point. The com.phylo.cor function is a part of the package ‘picante’ in
R (see Kembel et al), which uses the same algorithm as those in Cavender-Bares et al
(2004). The strength of the correlation is determined by comparison with a randomized
null model (999 replicates) (Webb 2000, Gotelli and Entsminger, Hardy et al), and we
find that the phylogenetic relatedness of barbets does not show stronger correlation with
co-occurrence than expected under the null model. This randomization additionally
allows us to account for any potential non-independence of points within the
randomization test. We have put in p-values for both the correlation co-efficient itself and
the randomization test, and specified which is which. We have also cited these papers
(and others) in the relevant sections throughout the manuscript, and expanded the
Methods to put in more detail. In addition, consolidating the main and supplementary
methods allows us to have all the information together in one place, and thus make both
our methods and rationale clearer. Additionally, we now present these results first, as we
feel this is the best way to introduce the results in the way the hypotheses are laid out.
The predictions from community phylogeny papers that are standards in the field
(Cavender-Bares et al, Webb 2000) are very important in understanding both our
hypotheses and the layout of our manuscript, and we have made sure to expand upon
these considerably in both the Introduction and the Discussion to improve the ‘flow’ of
the manuscript, and hopefully clear up any confusions that may have arisen from our
rather brusque treatment of this literature in the previous draft. These papers state that
trait patterns in communities are the outcome of the processes of community assembly
(such as competition and environmental filtering). Delineating the possible underlying
scenarios requires understanding not just trait patterns, but also how they map out along a
phylogeny, in addition to the phylogenetic structure of the community itself. These
concepts, and the predictions arising thereof, are treated in depth in the new and
expanded introduction.
270 – Correct. So, why were temporal traits (e.g. song duration) not studied in addition to
frequency? The choice of acoustic traits was not justified in the methods, and this
discussion suggests that additional traits should have been studied as well.
We agree that this was an important justification to make, and have reworked the
introduction both to provide a discussion of the temporal aspect of barbet vocalizations,
and a justification for our choice of acoustic frequency to study trait partitioning, so the
reader may better understand our hypotheses. The broad idea is that co-existing barbets
will overlap both ecologically, and in the sensory domain (resulting in masking
interference). Sensory signals of animals may diverge either in the temporal or spectral
domain to avoid interference. The phrasing of barbet vocalizations differs across species
(Gonzalez-Voyer et al 2013) and possesses complex within-phrase structure, which has
been noted to be species-specific (Short and Horne 2001; Horne and Short 2002). We
have included a figure (Figure 2) depicting the overall temporal vocal structure and the
diversity of barbet calls to illustrate this. The important take home message from this
figure is that the phrase itself is a stereotyped unit, repeated rapidly over short time
intervals. In this, barbets are similar to frogs inhabiting similar environments (albeit often
closer to the ground), which also produce stereotyped signals with high repetition rates.
Under these circumstances, temporal structure differences become less effective in
avoiding masking interference (Hodl 1977; Drewry and Rand 1983), and spectral (ie
frequency) differences become more important in segregating sound streams (see also
Nityananda et al, Schmidt et al). Sympatric communities of frogs partition their dominant
vocal frequencies (eg: Narins 1995), and we therefore asked if similar mechanisms
operate in barbets, which would provide a simple, elegant solution to masking
interference (see Wisniewski et al’s study on starlings, which can segregate temporally
overlapping sound streams based only on frequency differences; all of these papers are
cited in the manuscript). After identifying trait partitioning, we proceeded to use
evolutionary patterns in traits to address whether morphological or vocal divergence was
key in promoting species co-existence.
278 – This is one of the main conclusions of the paper, also prominent in the abstract. But
it is based on very indirect evidence (lower phylogenetic signal for morphology than for
sound frequency). More direct evidence would be based on the actual distribution of
phenotypes within communities. Perhaps check the papers cited above (Luther, Cardoso
& Price, and Tobias et al.) for examples of statistical approaches to test for partitioning in
phenotypic space within communities.
The above papers tested community partitioning in complex, large communities, often
without phylogenetic information available. Our analyses show the distribution of
phenotypes is non-overlapping in frequency space (Figure 4). In addition, we show that
the frequencies of simultaneously vocalizing barbets are always statistically
distinguishable from each other (Figure 5, Table S2), therefore indicating partitioning of
acoustic frequencies. We note this partitioning is clear enough that we can pick it up with
the simplest possible statistical analyses. We have made our analyses clearer in the text.
To answer the other question, we firstly note that this is a hypothesis based on our
interpretation of the patterns we observe, and we have made sure to stress it as such in
both the abstract and the main text. Secondly, we believe that our rationale for arriving at
this conclusion was not clear in the original draft, and our discussion of the background
in community phylogeny was fairly superficial. We have thus greatly extended this
discussion across the manuscript, and put in a note on Cavender-Bares et al’s predictions
on trait structure and community phylogeny (addressed elsewhere in this response).
Basically, we observe random phylogenetic structure within communities, and trait
partitioning, which is consistent with predictions of structure driven by competition or
competitive exclusion (Cavender-Bares et al). In this case, we would then expect the trait
driving community assembly to show signatures of divergence between related species.
We find this pattern for morphology, but not vocal frequency, which leads us to the
hypothesis, based on the size-frequency relationship (as well as the fact that some studies
on bird communities find partitioning, but others do not, now mentioned in the
introduction), that vocal frequency structuring is a by-product. We also conclude that
species co-existence is dependent on divergent morphology, and our data are a good fit
for that. This has, again, been elaborated greatly in the manuscript. Finally, we agree that
caution is required when interpreting standing patterns of trait variation to elucidate
mechanisms; this was already noted in the first draft, and continues to be so.
We believe that applying the techniques of community phylogeny to understand acoustic
trait structuring is important, and barbets present a unique advance in having recently had
their phylogeny worked out. To the best of our knowledge, most studies demonstrate
partitioning by a number of techniques and then hypothesize that this is the result of
acoustic competition or reinforcement of reproductive isolation. Our analyses suggest
that this may not always be the case, and that phylogenetic structure and trait evolution in
assemblages are important considerations in understanding the processes of acoustic
community structuring. In summary, we respectfully disagree that our line of approach is
more indirect than other approaches in the field, but agree that our manuscript did not
properly explain our analytical rationale, and have restructured the introduction,
discussion and the presentation of the results to make this clearer.
Supplementary materials:
- Not clear what is the statistical unit: each separate recording, or each measurement (up
to 10 per recording).
Each measurement served as a statistical unit; we have clarified this in the methods. We
have also revised the discussion of the statistics as mentioned earlier. Note that all these
are now in the main Methods, and therefore the changes discussed here as well.
- “Null matrices” mentioned in relation to the DOij, but it is not explained there or in the
main text what those mean, or what they are used for.
The null matrices were generated using randomized distributions of data (i.e species).
The null hypothesis is that species co-occurrence is random, and therefore we compare
the observed data to the null models. We have indicated as such in the Methods. We used
the ‘independentswap’ algorithm with 999 replicates to generate these null matrices, one
of many ways of randomizing community matrices. It preserves the frequency of
occurrence of a species, as well as the richness of a community (i.e the number of
species), and randomizes the presence-absence distribution of each species (Gotelli and
Entsminger, cited in the manuscript). We used this comparison to the null matrix to see if
our observed metric of community structure, i.e r, differed from that generated by a
random community. This also allows us to account for potential non-independence or
bias in sample points (to answer the earlier question), as these tests are quite robust to
those biases (Webb 2000), and we have reported both sets of p-values now. We also note
that our findings correlate well to the actual distribution of barbets, if you compare the
community composition (Figure 3), with the phylogeny in den Tex and Leonard (2013).
- Not sure if the discussion about Pagel’s lambda is needed, since it was not used.
As per reviewer 2’s comment, this section is now in the main methods.
- “The tips of the phylogenetic tree were shuffled randomly 1000 times” is not an
accurate description. Does this mean shuffling phenotypes on an unchanging phylogeny,
or actually changing part of the phylogeny (“tips”).
This means that the association with species and phylogenetic position was broken. Thus,
the resulting tree is random in that there is no true clustering of the tips in any clade. We
have clarified this in the relevant section of the methods; this is a commonly used
technique to test the hypothesis of phylogenetic signal.
Other comments:
Abstract and line 84 – incessant is perhaps excessive…
This has been amended.
35-37 – Unclear. The second statement (36-37) appears to contradict the first statement
(35-36).
40-42 – It would be better to note what the opinion is based on.\
We have reworked the abstract both to better flesh out our hypotheses and to address the
concerns above.
54 – Very vague statement; connection with sentence in the following line is not
apparent.
We have extensively reworked the introduction, and sensory signals are now introduced
in a different way; this sentence has been removed.
71-72 – Not sure I understand this sentence: shared habitat preferences helps species to
co-exist? Shouldn’t this cause increased competition? Maybe explain better.
The environmental filtering hypothesis is one invoked in community ecology (see
Cavender-Bares et al 2004, Lebrija-Trejos 2010) to explain phylogenetic structure and
trait patterns in communities. Environmental filtering acts in the opposite direction to
competition in structuring communities; species with similar traits (which may be related
species if the trait is evolutionarily conserved, or a random assortment of species if the
trait is labile) cluster together, as the traits are an adaptation to a shared environment. We
have put in a detailed explanation of this hypothesis in the introduction, as the predictions
of community structure outlined in Cavender-Bares et al, 2004 and Webb, 2000 are key
to our study.
116 – Unclear. What does it mean “log-transforming the collated measurements”?
Trasnforming first and averaging per species afterwards (which is correct), or averaging
first and log-transforming afterwards (which is not so correct). Please explain.
The data were transformed first, and then averaged afterwards for the phylogenetic
analyses. Thus, each individual measurement was log-transformed. We have clarified this
in the manuscript.
117 – Please state the purpose of this PCA.
The purpose of this PCA was to perform a morphospace ordination over a reduced
number of axes (i.e. to ordinate 7-dimensional morphospace in 2 dimensions, while
accounting for the maximum variation, sensu Ricklefs and Travis 1980, McGowan and
Dyke 2007, Lovette et al 2002, Irestedt et al 2013 and others). We have discussed this at
length in the response to reviewer 2’s comments, and have expanded upon this in the
manuscript as well, citing the relevant literature.
188 – Statistical results in table 2 are insufficiently reported (sample sizes or degrees of
freedom are missing).
We have put in the number of taxa in the tree in the legend (this was already in the text,
but we have made it more prominent). Blomberg’s K is an index of phylogenetic signal
(Munkemuller et al, now cited in our methods), which is basically a ratio of mean
squared errors that gives a value which may be interpreted as following or departing from
Brownian evolution. To determine the strength of phylogenetic signal, we compared the
observed K to a randomized K generated from 1000 randomly shuffled trees. The p-value
indicates the strength of the phylogenetic signal compared to this randomization, i.e.
there is significant phylogenetic signal, but this does or does not follow Brownian
evolution depending on the value of K. The paper published above reports the value of K
and the number of taxa, and we have amended our results to follow the same.
191 – Much of this results section reads more like methods or discussion text.
We have removed redundancies with the methods to state only the results that we
obtained.
263 – I do not understand how the previous sentences lead to this conclusion about sound
and mate quality.
We have extensively reworked this part of the discussion to match up to the reworked
introduction, and this sentence is no longer in the manuscript. We have instead
highlighted the role of frequency differences in minimizing acoustic masking
interferences, to synch our findings better with existing literature on frogs and crickets
(whose acoustic signals in many aspects resemble barbets).
272-276 – This is perhaps off-topic?
This discussion has been removed.
287-288– This is not always the case. It could easily have been tested here for barbet
species.
Gonzalez-Voyer et al. demonstrated a negative correlation between body size and
frequency in barbets. With regards to beak shape, we have presented this as a hypothesis
for another possible relationship between morphology and vocal frequency, based on
literature from other birds, and the fact that barbets vocalize with their beaks closed or
nearly so (not many birds do this). Simple principles of acoustic filtering will thus
suggest that the shape of the aperture in this scenario may influence vocal acoustics
(similar to blowing air out of a trumpet), but an actual mechanistic test of this requires a
considerable amount of data on 3D beak shape that are outside the scope of our study.
We have mentioned that this is a planned future direction of research, and in the context
of the discussion, have emphasized this as a possibility rather than a conclusion.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
Overall, I find this to be an interesting topic and a thought-provoking study. The finding
that Asian barbets demonstrate acoustic and ecological niche partitioning is very
interesting. It is also interesting that there are three clear size classes, consistent with
other model organisms of speciation research (e.g. ground finches and Wallacea’s bats
(Kingston & Rossiter Nature 2004)), a general pattern which receives no discussion.
However, I do not recommend this manuscript for publication in its current form. Below I
highlight a number of major and minor issues which should be addressed to make this
study stronger and more impactful.

Specific Comments:
The citations in the intro seem shallow, and somewhat obscure. For example, in addition
to/in lieu of citation [4], numerous broader works would seem relevant (e.g. work by
Mayr, Speciation by Coyne & Orr, Ecological Speciation by Nosil, Speciation in Birds by
Price)
Line 57: This is incorrect; there were several examples of acoustic character displacement
from crickets and frogs (cited in Kirschel et al 2009). Kirschel et al was the first example
for birds.
Lines 59-61: For a general topic journal like Royal Society Open Science, I feel broader
generalizations should be made beyond birds, where appropriate. Here, this scaling
relationship between size and frequency has been shown across diverse animal groups
(e.g. Gillooly & Ophir Proc B 2010).
We have reworked the introduction extensively to add in the necessary discussion of the
literature above, and also to elaborate on the broader, more general aspects of the
concepts we discuss. Additionally, as per reviewer 1’s suggestions of additional examples
of acoustic character displacement (e.g. in flycatchers), we have made sure to discuss
acoustic character displacement in more detail.
Line 62: This is not a novel prediction. There are several relevant papers and concepts
related here which should be recognized; in particular, this concept is similar to acoustic
space (sensu Nelson and Marler, Comparative Perception Vol 2, 1990), extended in the
acoustic window concept (Wilkins et al 2013). Moreover, it has been tested in bird
communities (Luther, Behavioral Ecology 2009), substrate-signaling lacewings (Henry &
Wells, Animal Behavior 2010) and bats (Kingston & Rossiter Nature 2004), and probably
other groups. Additionally, a recent study showed the opposite pattern of increased signal
similarity among co-occurring species (Tobias et al, PNAS 2014); moreover, sometimes
such increased signal similarity may be accommodated by increased perceptual acuity
(Tobias & Seddon Evolution 2009, Amezquita et al PNAS 2011). Framing the current
study better, in the context of this previous work, will make it easier to recognize the gap
it fills in our understanding of acoustic signal evolution.
We have included a discussion of the above literature as per this comment and those from
Reviewer 1, and have tried to frame our study better in this context.
Line 65-67: Acoustic signal divergence need not be adaptive. Several studies now show
divergence through neutral cultural and genetic drift. Moreover, sexual selection is
known to have a huge effect on signal evolution in numerous taxa…this is a glaring
omission in the background and framing of the paper. Clearly, the study does not focus
on sexual selection, but its role in signal evolution should be acknowledged.
We have reworked the introduction of the manuscript extensively, to include, among
other things, a discussion on possible factors influencing signal evolution. The primary
focus of this manuscript, however, is to examine community structure and the underlying
mechanisms of species co-existence by comparing morphology and vocal signals. We
have, therefore, acknowledged the roles of acoustic signals in advertisement,
communication and mate attraction (ie sexual selection), and stressed that the evolution
of acoustic signals may be driven by a combination of all these factors. We have placed
the focus upon the role of vocal differences in avoiding acoustic competition (ie masking
interference), and particularly frequency differences, in light of reviewer 1’s comments.
This rationale is treated both in the introduction and discussion.
Line 71-72: “Conversely…” I don’t follow this reasoning…shared habitat preferences
will only allow coexistence if there is sufficient divergence in ecology and/or mate
preferences…this is not in and of itself sufficient for species coexistence.
This sentence was stated in the context of the environmental filtering hypothesis, whose
effects oppose those of competition in structuring traits within communities. We have
provided a detailed response in reviewer 1’s comment on the same sentence, and have
also restructured the introduction completely to better explain the rationale for the
analysis. With acoustic signals, environmental filtering would predict that co-existing
species possess similar acoustic signals (as observed by Cardoso and Price), whereas
competition would predict that signals diverge (i.e. partitioning acoustic space).
Line 74-77: The logic of this hypothesis is flawed. Species distributions are inherently
stochastic, due to numerous historical and ecological factors. One would not expect
likelihood of co-occurrence to accrue linearly with time/genetic divergence. For example,
strong divergent selection may drive some populations to evolve very different
morphology or mating preferences in a short amount of time (e.g. rapid speciation shown
in swordtail crickets, marine and freshwater stickleback, African cichlids, etc), allowing
for coexistence; in contrast, highly genetically divergent species may sometimes mate
readily, leading to hybridization. Also, highly divergent species may competitively
exclude each other if they compete for the same niche (e.g. any invasive species vs native
species). As such, no relationship between phylogenetic relatedness and co-occurrence
should be expected. If such a pattern (particularly a linear relationship) were found, this
would be extremely surprising, and difficult to explain.
As currently framed, I don’t see that this straw-man hypothesis or its refutation
contributes to the manuscript.
We have amended the introduction extensively to clarify our rationale better. These
hypotheses are based on studies of community phylogeny (Cavender-Bares et al, Webb,
others) who use phylogenetic structuring and trait patterns to draw predictions about the
processes of community assembly. For example, if environmental filtering drives
community composition, then co-occurring species are predicted to have similar traits. If
this trait is an evolutionarily conserved one, then this is only possible if the community
consists of related species (niche conservatism). Conversely, if competition (or
competitive exclusion) is driving partitioning of traits in communities, then you would
predict, if the trait is conserved, that communities consist of distantly related species.
Alternatively, if the trait is phylogenetically labile, then related species or a random
sample of species may co-exist. These predictions are laid out in Cavender-Bares et al
(2004)’s study of trait patterns in ecological communities, and do not assume co-
occurrence to accrue, but draw inferences based on standing patterns of trait variation
along with community phylogenetic structure. One must, of course, be cautious in
drawing mechanistic inferences from current patterns, a fact that we have acknowledged
in the discussion, but the rationale for our analysis was to delineate these two scenarios
and hypothesize which was more likely, based on the predictions in the literature, and not
in any “trend in co-occurrence” per se. See the response to comment beginning ‘Line
183…” for an explanation of our tests for phylogenetic structure, which are also relevant
here.
We have elaborated on these predictions both in the introduction and the discussion, and
tried to frame our findings better in this context (reviewer 3 also requested falsifiable
predictions in our introduction, which we have laid out according to the above). As a
result, our introduction in particular is completely restructured, and we hope makes the
answer to this question clearer. Our data are consistent with a role for
competition/competitive exclusion based on morphological differences, as the
communities are randomly dispersed, with partitioned traits, but only morphology shows
strong signals of divergence between species.
Line 84-85: Reasons why incessant, highly stereotyped calls and a cryptic habit are good
qualities for this study should be explicitly stated. (Because of recording logistics,
relevance to the species’ natural history, or some other reason?)
These were all important factors in choosing barbets for this study. We have added a
clarification on this in the introduction.
Line 116: Please indicate why log-transformation was employed.
Log-transformation linearizes the relationships between variables with an allometric
relationship, such as morphometric data, rendering them multivariate normal. We have
indicated this in the methods, along with citations of papers using similar methods to
examine morphospace occupancy and community organization.
Line 127: Citation for ‘picante’ should be [18]; the R Base Package needs its own
citation.
We have put in the requisite citation for the R base package.
Line 129: Please explain more about the DOij metric: briefly, does it have a descriptive
name? How is it calculated, what is its range, and how might it be interpreted?
We have put this information in the Methods.
Line 131 and elsewhere: “co-efficient” does not need a hyphen
This has been amended.
Line 131-132: Discussion of why Blomberg’s K is used, rather than Pagel’s lambda
should be moved here from the supplement. This is important detail.
We have moved this section, along with the rest of the supplementary methods, to the
main manuscript.
Paragraph beginning with line 140: What criterion was used to extract PC axes? If PC1
explains 88% of the variation, PC2 may not be worth including. The Eigenvalues should
be reported for these axes in Table 1.
The PC axes were selected based on the “drop-off” in the proportion of explained
variance. PC2 explains ca. 6% of variation in the dataset, and there is a sharp drop-off
from PC2 to PC3 in % variance (and of course, an even steeper one from PC1 to PC2),
after which the % explained variance levels off (see the newly reworked table, now table
2). For this reason, we selected the first two PCs as containing, between them, sufficient
explanatory power for ordination of morphospace. We have provided a more detailed
table including the entire set of results from the PCA, with eigenvalues, together with the
proportion of explained variance, and have amended the text to reflect this better. Note
that the eigenvalues for all PCs are lower than 1, because log-transformation converts all
the variance in the data to a log scale as well, but still preserves their relationships
relative to each other, and thus their ordination in trait space. Ricklefs and Travis (1980)
provide a detailed explanation of this, and the utility and procedure of interpreting and
ordinating morphometric data, a procedure followed by other studies in addition to ours.
We have added citations to these studies along with a more detailed explanation of our
rationale.
Also, from Table 1, PC1 and PC2 have very similar loadings for several of the traits,
making the distinction between the two difficult to interpret. It is inaccurate to say that
PC1 indicates size and PC2 shape; PC1 loads higher on beak depth than PC2, and PC2
loads higher for tail length than PC1. If PC2 does explain significant phenotypic variation
(i.e. eigenvalue over 1), I would recommend using varimax rotation to increase the
interpretability of these axes (that is, maximize the difference in trait loadings on the two
factors). Having more interpretable differences between axes would make the plots in
figure 2 much more informative.
The interpretations as described here have been toned down throughout the manuscript.
We agree that it is too simplistic to refer to one as a size axis and the other as a shape
axis, and have amended this throughout. Many papers in the literature (which we have
cited extensively throughout the manuscript, such as McGowan et al’s comparative study
of flying animals, Ricklefs and Travis 1980, Lovette et al 2002 on Hawaiian
honeycreepers, and Irestedt et al’s 2013 paper on Red-bellied Pittas) have concluded that
morphometric PC1 scores typically contain size information, because the factor loadings
are all positive, and similar in magnitude; something we also see. PC2, in our case,
correlated negatively with beak characters and positively with tail characters, which is
why we interpreted it to contain some information on shape (based on the sign of the
loadings and the fact that bill width and tail length load the strongest). We do agree,
however, that we should interpret this more cautiously, and have therefore amended our
interpretation to “morphologically divergent” instead of size/shape divergence between
sympatric species throughout the manuscript. We have additionally put the measurements
themselves (range for each species) in supplementary, so the reader may compare traits
between species. The section on describing size classes has also been revamped; we now
refer to them as morphospace classes I, II and III, and interpret them to constitute size
classes based on the fact that:
1. Class III contains larger-bodied, species, class I contains small-bodied species, and
Class II intermediate ones based on comparison with the measurements provided in
supplementary, and
2. The larger-bodied species in class III possess higher PC1 scores, and the smaller ones
in class I lower PC1 scores.
The purpose of this PCA was to perform a trait ordination with a reduced number of axes
(i.e. to reduce 7-dimensional morphological space to a 2-dimensional one to easily assess
the trait space both of barbets as a whole, and of sympatric species). This allows us to
easily compare sympatric species in communities over trait space, which was the primary
question this analysis aimed to address. This procedure has been employed in many
morphometric studies (several relevant bird studies are now cited in the paper). For
example, we have added citations to Ricklefs and Travis (1980) (and others, including
recent studies above), who developed this method to study bird community organization
using morphological traits, similar to our broad questions. We have made this expanded
rationale clear throughout the manuscript, and reworked our interpretation accordingly.
Similarly, our plotting method (ordinating PC1-PC2 space) has been widely used to
ordinate morphological divergence. The main issue with the earlier version, as we see it,
was over-interpreting what each axis meant, and we have thus taken great care to tone
that down. Our message still remains consistent, though, based on the reworked
interpretation above: 1. Three morpho-classes, corresponding to size classes, and 2.
Morphological divergence between sympatric species. Many thanks for the constructive
suggestions, which have helped us improve both the background and the interpretations
of this analysis.
Lines 149-151: PC2 is listed twice
This has been amended.
Line 167: I have a hard time assessing significant differences from this figure. Might
consider letters above boxplots to show the results of post-hoc tests.
We have amended the figure and text to reflect the main reasoning behind that figure,
which is to show the overall variation and range of frequencies occupied by each species.
The fact that they occupy largely distinct frequency regions suggests partitioning. A true
test of partitioning, however, would be to test if simultaneously vocalizing species
occupied distinct frequency bands (barbets often vocalize together at the same time and
not at different times of the day), and we have proceeded to perform our statistical
analyses on those samples.
Line 183: Rather than a correlation, one might expect a threshold effect of phylogenetic
relationship on species co-existence (essentially a phylogenetic species concept based on
a certain level of differentiation required for post-mating isolation).
As noted earlier, the point of this analysis is not to show any sort of accruing of co-
occurrence with phylogenetic relatedness, but rather to test for phylogenetic structure
within communities. These are standard analyses used in community phylogeny
(Cavender-Bares et al 2004, Webb 2000, Hardy 2008 to name a few), and have been
incorporated as standard tests in the ‘picante’ package (see Kembel et al). The test for
phylogenetic structure determines the correlation coefficient between relatedness and
DOij as a metric, and then determines if communities are phylogenetically conserved,
overdispersed or randomly sampled by comparison to a randomized null community (see
the expanded section on this in the methods). This last is what we detect in our analyses
(we have put in p-values for the randomization test and expanded our descriptions to
indicate this). Therefore, it is not the distribution or the trend of the points that we test for
here, but simply whether the metric of phylogenetic structure differs from a randomized
null community (Webb 2000, Gotelli and Entsminger, Hardy 2008 all discuss null models
and tests for phylogenetic structure).
Once again, matching these to predictions from community phylogeny (Cavender-Bares
et al), we may draw inferences about community assembly from patterns of trait
dispersion. Reviewer 3 has pointed out that this groundwork was not clearly laid out in
the previous draft, and we agree that this may have been the source of much confusion.
We have, therefore, as mentioned earlier, reworked the introduction to focus our
hypotheses better, and bring out the community phylogeny aspects of our study better.
We also recap the predictions of Cavender-Bares et al for the benefit of the reader, as
well as pointing them to that paper.
Line 184: “We calculated…” Unnecessary, since previously stated in methods.
This sentence has been removed.
Line 188: To me it would seem more interesting to show these plots, rather than test for a
correlation, and to assess whether there is in fact a threshold level of differentiation for
“good species” coexistence.
We have responded to the same in the comment starting with “Line 183”, and also the
comment about this hypothesis in the introduction.
Line 211-212: This is an inaccurate portrayal of the literature. The classic model of
speciation (Darwin, Mayr) is through allopatric ecological divergence. This is certainly
not a new development.
Lines 216-218: Seems disconnected. Why is this relevant information?
We have removed both these sentences.
Lines 218-220: This is actually really cool! I wonder if you were to look through the
literature at speciation studies, how often you might find a pattern of three such size
classes forming during species radiations. Certainly this is famously the case with
Galapagos ground finches.
We have elaborated on this a bit more in the discussion, to compare barbets with both
Darwin’s finches and bats, the latter of which is particularly relevant to our results.
Reviewer 3 has, however, noted that Darwin’s finches are a relatively young adaptive
radiation, and thus might differ significantly from barbets in how they diversified. To
balance both these comments, we have tried to keep further comparisons to Galapagos
finches to a minimum.
Line 228: Why might this be the case? Some sort of interpretation would link this to the
next paragraph better.
We have reworked the discussion as mentioned earlier, so the discussion of evolutionary
patterns in morphology now comes up towards the end of the discussion. This section is
now linked by the theme of niche divergence, and this should no longer be a problem.
Line 262-264: As stated previously, given the known importance of sexual selection in
vocal signal evolution, it should be more incorporated in the introduction and discussion.
We have incorporated the factors influencing signal evolution into the manuscript.
Line 265 & 269: Uy and Safran 2013 is a very relevant reference here, addressing this
general principle.
This citation has been included.
274-276: Seems a little off-topic. Also, I think paragraph should end with some summary
statement, helping assimilate all this discussion.
This discussion has been removed, and the paragraph reworked to tie it into the next
section better.
291-293: Why? What exactly will be gained from such an investigation?
This sentence has been removed.
300-301: Reinforcement is a process that could increase species discrimination and signal
divergence. Species recognition itself is not a driver of signal divergence.
This has been removed.
302-307: I think the reader does not need to be convinced that this is a fascinating
system. This is clear. Instead, I would be interested to know more about how this fits in
with other systems and broad patterns of signal divergence, especially given recently
demonstrated opposite patterns in South American birds (Tobias et al 2014). Why might
these patterns differ? If it’s unclear, how can we answer that question?
We have modified the last paragraph to contrast our results with Kirschel et al’s on the
related tinkerbirds. These patterns may be broader and more general, particularly among
animals that do not learn their acoustic signals, and the ending sentence has been
amended to reflect this better. The previous statements have been excised.

This is a timely (with the phylogeny out) paper that addresses some interesting questions.
Asian clades are often neglected in niche diversification/divergence research, and this
paper is a valuable contribution. The paper also shows strong and interesting pattern of
little overlap in morphospace among sympatric barbets, and random evolution in acoustic
signals. This review contains both general and specific comments.
I’m not too familiar with this journal, Royal Society Open Science. Assuming it’s an
online only journal, I don’t understand why the methods need to put inside supplementary
materials, making it harder for readers since they have to flip to both sections (main
section and SM) to understand the methods. The supplementary methods sections is only
4.5 pages long (double spaced) and could easily fit inside the main text. Also, the SM do
not contain line numbers, making it harder to refer.
We appreciate this suggestion. This split in the Methods was left over from a previous
submission. Having confirmed that this journal does not impose constraints on
manuscript length, we have now consolidated the main and supplementary methods into
the main manuscript text, following the suggestions of all reviewers.
Introduction
In general, the introduction appears jumpy and disjoint at places. Some subject matters
have large body of research behind them, but have only been addressed superficially.
Having said that, it does a relative good job outlining the role character displacement
plays in allowing species to co-exist, followed by subsequent acoustic divergence. Parts
of the introduction just need to be elaborated and “smoothen” to make it a better read.
We have revised the introduction extensively in accordance with comments from all
reviewers, and have tried to lay the groundwork for our hypotheses better.
ln 53
While it is generally true that hybridization can be costly, I don’t believe that this is
generally a problem for sympatric species, otherwise a hybrid swarm will be produced
(quite rare). When species come into sympatry, it is generally after full reproductive
isolation has been achieved, usually via long isolation (and drift) and/or reinforcement.
The Darwin’s finches [ref 4] is a very young clade that arose through ecological
speciation, so they may not be a good example how speciation and signal divergence
work in general. The authors should also venture beyond just one citation (tinkerbirds) to
paint a more general picture of how mating signals “influence species co-existence”.
We have toned down the importance of hybridization here, and rather highlighted
acoustic competition (i.e. masking interference). This was a critical point in choosing
frequency analysis as an acoustic trait (see answer to reviewer 1, and also Figure 2 and
the introduction for a discussion of temporal patterns of barbet vocalization, and why
frequency differences are important). We have, therefore, toned down the species
recognition aspects of signals to a question of “Is ecological or sensory competition an
important driver of community assembly?” as barbets appear to diverge in both traits. We
have also expanded our discussion of signals and signal evolution per the other
reviewers’ comments.
ln 65
which ecological processes..
The authors have not mentioned what ecological processes are responsible for
determining the structuring of traits in a community. The next sentences go on to ask
whether acoustic signal divergence is the direct result of the need to discriminate among
species or is it an indirect consequence of morphological changes. But what are the
ecological processes that are responsible for these changes in the first place? This section
seems to ask a question but leave it dangling (no presentation of alternative hypotheses).
As mentioned above, we have revised the introduction to better lay out our hypotheses,
and as a result it is now entirely different in layout to the previous version. We now
highlight the importance of avoiding acoustic masking, and the predictions should tie into
our analyses better.
ln 69-76
I suggest that the authors cite some foundational community phylogeny papers that lay
the groundwork for discussing ecological filtering vs competition in shaping communities
(eg Webb, Cavender-Bares).
We have included a discussion of this literature as well as others that utilize similar
methods to understand phylogenetic structure of communities.
ln 92
what processes influence...
This question is a little nebulous. After the introduction, this would be the place to lay out
specific questions and falsifiable hypotheses, like: do morphological traits/size evolve
according to a brownian motion process along the phylogenetic tree (and what this
means).
We have revised the last section of the introduction accordingly.
Methods (and supplementary materials [with sm notation, followed by page number, but
no line number] reviewed together) As mentioned above, for the sake of tractability, the
methods section should combine into one section in the main text.
We have consolidated the Methods section into the main text.
sm2 These regions (with GPS coordinates...
Add either N/S and E/W or say which is latitude, longitude
We have added N/S and E/W to clarify the GPS co-ordinates.
sm2 We determined presence/absence of each barbet species in each cell..
Please elaborate on how the DOij metric calculates co-occurrence (does not show up till
sm page 4 or line 129 in main text). For example, how does it treat the following types of
grid cells: 2 spp present, only 1 of 2 species present, no species present?
This information has been put into the relevant part of the methods.
ln 109
How many individuals per species (and sexes)? And basic information like mean,
standard deviation of each trait for each species. Were there missing data (eg beak
broken)? This information is not given in a summarized form and the excel table contains
no measurements (just specimen ID).
The gender information for each specimen (wherever this information was on specimen
labels) is in the supplementary materials next to the specimen ID numbers. We have
additionally added an extra spreadsheet to the supplementary data file containing the
number of individuals per species as well as the range of trait values obtained per species
for each trait. Finally, we have added a note on specimen selection in the relevant section
of the methods. We took care to measure specimens that were in good condition only,
and did not measure specimens with broken beaks, etc (which was possible because of
the extensive collections at the museums we sampled), thus there was no missing data for
any of our specimens.
Acoustic analysis
Again, it appears that basic information like sample sizes is missing in a table form. The
readers have to count rows in Table S1 to find out sample sizes. Perhaps simple “N
(sample size)” above each boxplot in Fig 3 would suffice.
We have put in sample sizes and test statistics both in Figure 3 (now Figure 4) and in
Supplementary Table S2, also in accordance with Reviewer 1’s comments, and have
indicated as such in the legends for both. We note here that sample size in Table S1 (now
Figure 4) was based on as much of an available sample as possible, to identify the overall
range in vocal frequency for each species. This way, we could make sure that as much
variation was captured as possible for our phylogenetic analyses. In this regard, we have
been as conservative as possible. Figures 3 and 4 now represent our across-species
comparisons of morphological and acoustic traits, which show clear community-level
structuring. To test statistically for acoustic partitioning, we then compare simultaneously
vocalizing species and show that this structuring is statistically detectable in every single
case.
ln 131
Please elaborate how phylogenetic distance is obtained. Is it patristic distance extracted
from a tree you reconstructed from raw sequence data and what R function was used?
Pearson’s correlation: Because the species are phylogenetically “correlated”, I wonder if
pearson’s is the right analysis to use since the species are not independent. Shouldn’t a
mantel’s test be used?
The function comm.phylo.cor uses a cophenetic distance (explained in the response to
reviewer’s comments), which may be calculated from a consensus tree (we used the tree
from den Tex and Leonard, as mentioned). This r value is used as a metric of
phylogenetic structure, per the standard, and we compare it to a randomized community
obtained using 999 replicates. This randomization also allows us to account for potential
non-independence of samples within the randomization test; additionally, the co-
occurrence of a species pair may be considered an independent point from another
species pair, and pairwise co-occurrence metrics are commonly used in many analyses
we have come across (eg: Narwani et al, Riedinger et al, now cited in the paper).
ln 131
Is the average value of each trait of each species used in the phylogenetic signal analysis?
It is not until results that it is clear that both the PC’s and individual traits are used in the
analysis.
Yes, the average value of each trait was used in the signal analysis, as well as the average
PC scores for each species. We have made this clearer in the Methods.
Results
Fig.2
Some of the species are very hard to tell apart from one another. Eg, in B, there are 4
species with red squares and reddish/pinkish polygons. Please change the symbols and/or
polygon colors.
We have increased the size of the circular and triangular symbols to make them more
clearly visible against the red squares, and also darkened the magenta polygons to make
them more distinct from the red polygons.
ln 167
With Tukey’s multi-comparison tests, horizontal lines are usually drawn between pairs of
samples to show significant differences. This pairwise information is missing in Fig. 3.
As indicated earlier, we have retooled this section of the manuscript to first compare the
overall frequency range of each species in a community, in keeping with frog literature.
The point of that figure (now figure 4) is that each species possesses a frequency
component that is species-specific, but a true test of partitioning will be whether they
vocalize in distinct frequency bands when vocalizing together. We have thus performed
statistical tests on those recordings, reported in Table S2 and Figure 5. This allows us to
directly compare species, verify that they vocalize simultaneously but at separate
frequencies, and Figure 4 now serves as a descriptive figure of acoustic traits, which
allowed us to capture as much intraspecific variation as possible for the phylogenetic
signal analyses.
ln 177 (multi-individual recordings)
Since each recording becomes a test in itself, does each phrase becomes a sample (vs
Table S1 where each single-individual recording and its peak comprise a sample)? How
the two kinds of recordings are treated statistically is quite confusing to me.
Each element of a phrase formed a data point in our statistical analyses (Table S2 and
Figure 5), both to maintain consistency across species, as well as to account for frequency
differences between elements of a phrase in our statistical analyses. We have made this
clear in the methods.
ln181 onwards
In the following result section, each paragraph starts with a series of questions and
minimethods. This should have been logically laid out in intro/methods. This section just
need to describe results that you set out to produce.
We have amended this in both the relevant sections.
Discussion
ln 228
Local barbet assemblages are made up of random mixed of species from the phylogeny
(no correlation between co-occurrence and phylogenetic relatedness). Yet K analysis
shows that closely related species differ in size and shape more than expected under
Brownian evolution. So is this divergence in size/shape caused by or in any way related
to co-occurrence? Perhaps this section can be bolstered a little more by explaining how
the whole process may work. For example (just thinking out loud), when speciation
happens initially, morphology may diverge because the nascent species are in close
contact or in competition. Subsequently, when a local assemblage is being formed,
species from the regional pool of species may be selected at random (but contingent on
them being different enough morphologically?).
We have put in the following sentence in the first section of the discussion:
Niche diversification may occur in sympatry or allopatry, with subsequent sympatry
being contingent on reduced niche overlap.
As we note later, however, we feel it is best to be cautious in inferring mechanisms from
standing patterns of trait variation. A previous review of this manuscript noted exactly
this point, and we agree that it is best to avoid speculating too far about mechanisms.
ln 294
I believe both Darwin’s finches and tinkerbirds are poor examples to wrap up and support
your barbet study. First, the finches belong to an adaptive radiation (young radiation,
ancestral species arrived at islands with open niches, quickly filled them up). I don’t think
the barbets got their morphological diversification this way. Second, as mentioned earlier,
acoustical diversification is likely a by-product of morphological diversification in
barbets (but no specific evolutionary direction). In tinkerbirds, the need to not confuse
among species may play an active role in causing acoustic signals to diverge. Therefore,
these species are actually not good examples to support your conclusions of how barbet’s
calls and morphology evolve.
As per Reviewer 2’s comments, we have compared the “three size class” structuring of
barbet morphology to both Darwin’s finches and bats, as this trend seems to occur more
generally than just barbets. We agree that Darwin’s finches are not the best example to
wrap up the manuscript, for the reasons mentioned here, and have excised that. The
comparison with tinkerbirds, however, is something we feel is important to make,
particularly because tinkerbirds are from the African barbet family, and are quite closely
related. We feel that it is important, therefore, to draw both parallels with the Asian
barbets, as well as to contrast our conclusions with theirs. We have also altered the final
statements of the manuscript in accordance with reviewer 2’s comments.

Comments to the Author(s)
This revised version generally improved the clarity of explanations. For example, the introduction reads
very well, and the descriptions and results of the tests of phylogenetic structure are clear also.
However, several statistical problems remain, and the most important conclusions of the paper are
based on visual inspection of plots with no statistical testing (see main comments below). As a result,
the main conclusions of the article partitioning in morphological and acoustic space (e.g. lines 34, 37-
41, 340-341) are unfounded, and the discussion is excessively speculative.
We appreciate the suggestions from the reviewer, and would like to note here that the figures referred
to were meant to be descriptive of the traits of species within each community (as also mentioned in
the previous response to the first round of reviews), as is standard with many similar studies (see
Lovette et al, Irestedt et al for morphology, and various frog and cricket papers for acoustics; our
studies show many similarities to these latter in considering small assemblages of closely related
species). It appears that our use of the term ‘partitioning’ was misleading in the context of our
conclusions, and may have resulted in some ambiguity. We do not show that species partition
available trait space, but rather that sympatric species are divergent from each other in their
morphological and acoustic traits (which is more in line with Cavender-Bares et al’s predictions, and
Kirschel et al’s results). We have changed the title and replaced “partitioned” with “divergent”
throughout our results and discussion to better clarify this. After describing trait patterns within
communities, we then proceed to test for mechanisms of community assembly using phylogenetic
structure analyses (which was the major point of our study). We do agree, however, that some sort of
quantitative measure of species overlap in trait space would make the results more informative in
these sections. Therefore, we have now included pairwise measures of Cohen’s d (standardized ‘effect
size’ which represents the overlap between two distributions in terms of their standard deviations) to
represent the degree of trait overlap between species in a quantitative way (described in the Methods).
We have put these values in the Supplemental Data file 2; note that the trait means for nearly all
geographically overlapping species differ by more than twice the pooled standard deviation (d>2 for
each pairwise comparison). Exceptions to this pattern (d<2) are almost always separated by habitat or
altitude (i.e. are not sympatric; see color coding in Figures 3 and 4 to sort species into sympatric
communities; we have also marked these exceptions on both figures). We have revised the relevant
portions of the results and the figure legends to make this clearer.
Main comments, by line number:
233-234 – This is statistically incorrect. Measurements of different element in a phrase are not
statistically independent, and measurement of different phrases in a recording are just repeated
measurements of the same thing. I would think that measurements should be averaged and each
recording be a statistical unit.
The reply letter makes it clear that each measurement is a statistically unit (which is incorrect), but the
manuscript is more vague, both here and in later parts (e.g. figures report N both as number of
elements and number of recordings).
For the data depicted in Figure 4 (i.e. the community-level analyses), we have clarified in the methods
section on Cohen’s d that we did indeed average each recording as a statistical unit (although we
report two N sizes in the figure for information). The analyses in Figure 5, on the other hand, represent
multiple species vocalizing in a single recording, and in order to compare species within this
recording, the average here is an average of all the elements per species in the recording. We then
compared the means as described. We address the rationale for the multispecies comparison in the
response to the comment on lines 238-243. We have amended the relevant Methods section to clarify
this.
291-301 – This results paragraph is only descriptive, based on plotting species values on graphs, with
no use of statistic tests.
The previous section correctly makes use of statistics for testing phylogenetic clustering in
communities. This section too needs to use statistic test in order to understand if communities are
random in relation to morphology, or clustered, or overdispersed. We should not take conclusions
based only on screening plots.
As mentioned earlier, the point of this plot was to show that each species in a sympatric community
was divergent from all others. The patterns as noted in the figure are quite clear (i.e. similarly colored
species do not overlap in trait space), but we agree that some quantitation of the extent of overlap
between species, and their distance from each other in trait space would be more informative. We
have therefore implemented Cohen’s d as mentioned above (with Methods described). Once again, we
would like to note that we do not show ‘partitioning’ of morphological space per se, but rather
divergence in traits. We would also like to note that previous studies (for example, Irestedt et al,
Proceedings B) typically describe morphological divergence qualitatively, or by quantifying overlap in
some way. Therefore, we believe we are in step with other literature on similar topics, and have
applied a stringent criterion for ‘overlapping’ species (the species means differ by less than twice the
pooled standard deviation, or a d<2 for both PC1 and PC2; basically to show that they are not
divergent along either morphospace axis, which is also clear from the figure). All d values are in
Supplemental Data File 2, and we have made this clear in that file as well.
307 – Unlike stated here, I see plenty of overlap in frequency between sympatric species in most
panels of Figure 4.
Again, this paragraph in lines 304 to 311 takes conclusions without statistical tests.
We have revised this sentence to say that sympatric barbets vocalize in distinct frequency bands. Our
data is plotted as box plots in the interest of a) being conservative, and b) displaying the entire
possible frequency band occupied by a species; an average plus SD would have shown little to no
overlap, but will ‘wash out’ important information on the full frequency range of the species that we feel
the reader should see. There will, therefore, be some degree of overlap in the ‘whiskers’ of the plots
but note that in most cases the ‘boxes’ (the interquartile ranges) do not overlap. We have
acknowledged all overlapping species pairs in the results and the figure, and discuss each of them.
We note again that many studies typically represent the entire frequency band of a species in a
manner similar to ours (the frog and cricket literature also typically begins with a descriptive figure of
traits, followed by further analyses, as we have done with our phylogenetic structure analyses), and we
have now added the extra step of quantifying overlap (see previous comment; as with Figure 3,
sympatric species are color-coded, and most species with overlapping frequencies are in distinct color
regions). Wherever the sample size was too low to calculate Cohen’s d, we have described the trait
overlap of these species only qualitatively, but have made sure to state this explicitly both in the results
and the figure legends so as to be conservative.
312-320 (also lines 238-243) – The tests reported here are inadequate to support the claims about
acoustic partitioning or acoustic structuring. These are simple tests of whether there are frequency
differences among species (it would be very strange if there were no differences among species, even
if small). Getting at the idea of acoustic partitioning or acoustic structuring needs much more: it needs
statistical testing (e.g. randomization tests) that tell us whether communities are random in relation to
the sound frequency, or clustered, or overdispersed. This is the same problem as in the previous
section (see comment on lines 291-301).
As mentioned previously, we believe our use of the word ‘partitioning’ may have been misleading as to
tour hypotheses and results, and have removed this word throughout the manuscript, taking care to
use the correct terminology. In fact, we demonstrate divergent frequencies (and morphologies) among
species, and have also revised the title to reflect this. We argue that if a species occupies a narrow
frequency range (as barbets do), even a small frequency difference may be quite significant in
reducing masking interference; note that we mentioned in the paper that barbets possess narrow-band
vocalizations. Again, as mentioned previously, we have quantified this trait overlap using pairwise
Cohen’s d, which takes into account the variance for each species.
Our analyses did not aim to test whether the communities were dispersed throughout available
frequency space. The communities we have constructed are relatively small, and obtaining null
communities to perform randomization tests poses inherent problems when community size is smaller,
and in any case was outside the scope of our manuscript (see earlier explanations). Our hypotheses
are simple: are traits divergent in communities (i.e. is a species distinct from all other species?) or
convergent? If divergent, which of these traits are likely to be important in community assembly, and
how do they map out on the phylogeny of barbets (which are the primary questions we address)? We
also note that many studies performing the latter do not show their trait data, and usually only obtain a
single value per species. Our broad hypotheses are similar to Kirschel et al (PNAS 2009) who
examined divergent morphological and acoustic traits in tinkerbirds; ours investigate a broader scale,
comparing six multispecies sympatric assemblages. We have made this clear throughout (including
the title), and hope that this reduces ambiguity.
Other comments:
80-87 - It is interesting reading these lines that almost all papers finding evidence for acoustic
partitioning worked with closely related species (e.g. references 25 to 35). The papers that do not find
evidence for acoustic partitioning deal with taxonomically diverse assemblages (refs 38, 39). Perhaps
acoustic partitioning is needed for closely related taxa, but not so much for more distantly related taxa,
whose signals would have diverged a lot already? This point might be relevant for this article study,
since it focuses on closely related species.
We appreciate the suggestion. More closely related species may encounter more competition for
acoustic space. We have added that close relatives in particular compete for acoustic space, and that
signals of related species may diverge to avoid competition, in this section of the introduction.
96,97 – A bit unclear what “trait patterns” mean here. Please make this more explicit.
Amended to ‘phylogenetic signal’ or clarified as such wherever appropriate.
99 – “and” or “or”?
‘And’. Cavender-Bares et al. predict both trait divergence and phylogenetic overdispersion (i.e. co-
occurrence of distantly related species).
100 – Again, it is unclear what is meant by “patters of trait evolution” here. Please make this explicit.
See also comment on line 245.
See our response above. This has been changed.
126 – The expression “repetition rate” is usually used in the literature to mean how fast or how slow
songs or song elements are repeated. This does not seems to be the meaning here, but rather that
repetition is common (not referring specifically to how fast or slow it is). Thus, consider avoiding the
expression “repetition rate”.
We actually did mean to say that barbet calls are repeated at a high rate. We accidentally used the
word ‘this’ instead of ‘the’, which created a mistaken link to the previous sentence that appears to have
been misleading. We have corrected this. Short and Horne discuss the fact that barbet calls are
repeated at a high rate, as do Gonzalez-Voyer et al. See also our plots in Figure 2. Although repetition
rates vary across species, many species repeat song elements rapidly (some over 100/min, see Short
and Horne).
204, 205 – This is correct, morphological measurements should be log-transformed because of
allometric scaling. But, for the same reasons, sound frequency should have been log-transformed too:
the relation between sound frequency and morphology is linearized in log-log plots and, unlike linear
frequency, log frequency quantifies differences in sound perception and production in a comparable
way across the frequency range (Cardoso 2013 Animal Behaviour).
We have used log-transformation for the morphological data because this was a multivariate analysis,
and we used it to render the data multivariate normal for the purposes of principal component analysis.
We do not relate vocal frequency and size (this has already been done by Gonzalez-Voyer et al, cited
in the manuscript, we use this as a hypothesis to explain the patterns we observe), nor are we
quantifying sound perception directly. Our acoustic analyses are univariate, analysing only differences
in frequency, and our plots use linear-scale measures both for the sake of being intuitive, and to
remain consistent with the large body of literature that represents frequency differences on a linear
scale (Kirschel et al, PNAS being most relevant to our study, note that they also perform a PCA on
morphological characters). Finally, we note that the purpose of our analyses is 1) to test if sympatric
species are morphologically divergent (for which we used a multivariate analysis to account for the
seven characters in our dataset), 2) to separately test if they are also divergent in their vocal
frequencies, and then to assess phylogenetic patterns in both these traits to determine which traits are
likely to influence community assembly.
230 – Please replace “delineate each element” by a more detailed description of what is done. The
word “delineate” may suggest that the frequencies were measured manually, using the on-screen
cursor (this is what I thought reading the previous version of the methods). But, after reading the next
sentence in this version, it appears that the frequency of maximum amplitude was instead
automatically measured by Luscinia. Is this correct? Please make it clear if peak frequency was
measured using the on-screen cursor (and in that case need to give more details/justifications), if the
cursor was only used to identify start and end point of elements, or if this is an intermediate situation
(e.g. the cursor limits the frequency range of sound that Luscinia then uses to find peak frequency).
The cursor was used to mark the time duration of the element, and Luscinia then calculates the peak
frequency. We have clarified this.
233 – Since you use the term “peak frequency” and define it, it is unnecessary, and perhaps a bit
confusing, to also refer to the synonym term “dominant frequency” here.
This has been removed.
238-243 – It was difficult for me to understand the rationale for these statistical tests, because they
only use a small part of the recordings (those with more than 1 species vocalizing), and statistical
analyses using the majority of recordings are not described. (Later on I understood that no statisticl
analyses were made on those other recordings, only plotting; see comment on line 307). Need to
describe these statistical analyses together with an explanation of the rationale for them (this is only
stated later on in the results section; lines 312 onwards), and how they fit together with the main
analyses of the other recordings.
Also, it is not clear why only a subset of recordings (those with multiple species) was used for this. The
methods previously described how you defined barbet communities, and this test ignores that previous
work, instead simply using the set of species that happen to be in a recording. Why?
We have expanded on this rationale in the methods, and our analyses now take care of the comment
about using a subset of recordings. Basically, the nature of our data meant that the sample size for
some species in the community-level figure (i.e. number of available good-quality recordings) was too
low to calculate Cohen’s d, and we described those results in qualitative terms. To further verify our
findings on acoustic frequency, and to account for variability resulting from different recordists using
equipment with different sensitivity, etc., we also analyzed 37 recordings with multiple species
vocalizing simultaneously (spanning 23 species of barbet). This verifies two things: 1) that sympatric
barbets often vocalize together (stated in the literature but this provides verification as well), and 2)
that when vocalizing together, they occupy distinct frequency bands.
245 – After reading this section, I understand that what is referred elsewhere by “patterns of trait
evolution” is simply “phylogenetic signal”. So, perhaps phrasing throughout the article, and also the
name of this section, should be changed simply to “phylogenetic signal”. Writing of “evolutionary
patterns” is vague and suggests broader analyses that what was actually done.
We have changed this as per suggestions throughout.
282-290 – This categorical classification of specimens size was not anticipated in the methods. What
is the objective of categorizing size? why not to treat it as a continuous variable (as apparently
described in the methods)?
This was not a treatment of size as a categorical variable, which is why it is not described in the
methods. Rather, it is a description of our observations. We performed the morphospace ordination
treating size as a continuous variable (as described in the methods), and found that the data points
formed three clusters. We also noticed that species tend to fall into one or other of these three clusters
(with the exception of the single P.monticola specimen). Ascribing names to these clusters allows us to
describe them to the reader in a way that is intuitive. We have mentioned in the results that the data
form three clusters, which we refer to as Classes I, II and III for convenience. We then note that these
broadly correspond to large, medium and small-sized species, and therefore interpret these clusters as
size classes.
330-333 – Interesting result that closely related species are more divergent in morphology that
expected by chance (i.e. than expected by Brownian motion). But this test does not take into account
whether sympatry has an effect on this divergence or not. So, this result does not cover for the above
criticisms (see comments on lines 291-301, 312-320).
We have responded to the comments on these lines above. Note that we were not testing for whether
morphological divergence is a result of sympatry. We simply describe patterns of morphological
divergence, and use tests of community phylogeny to understand the mechanisms of community
assembly. The very first part of our discussion explicitly states that species traits may diverge in
sympatry or in allopatry, and we do not distinguish between these mechanisms. We are, instead,
testing for trait-related mechanisms by which species coexist (again, mentioned in the first part of the
discussion).

Comments to the Author(s)
Krishnan and Tamma have done a laudable job with this revision of their manuscript! This version is
much clearer in terms of the overall hypothesis-testing framework, summary of the relevant literature,
and explanation of the methodological approach. This work provides a clear example of the
intersection of ecological adaptation and signal evolution in community assembly and I expect it to be
an influential paper in the acoustics and speciation literature. Below I indicate a few suggestions for
further improvements to the manuscript.
We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments in both rounds of review. Attached below are our
responses and revisions to the reviewer’s final comments.
Line 77: Sympatric signalers… This sentence doesn’t flow well from the previous sentence. I think it
would be good to say explicitly that in this study you’re not directly testing the drivers of signal
divergence, but attempting to identify broader patterns of community structure. e.g. Regardless of
which taxon-specific factors drive signal evolution, sympatric signalers compete for acoustic space
[18], and signals with similar… or some other phrase linking the two sentences.
We have modified this sentence according to the suggestion above, and it now reads as such.
Line 88: I think the new paragraph should begin here.
This has been changed.
Line 94: “, albeit…” phrase unnecessary; redundant.
We have removed this phrase.
Line 182: DOij is robust to what?
DOij is robust to confounding differences in species abundance, as it extracts only the spatial structure
of the distribution of a species. Hence, it tends to zero for independent distributions of species (Hardy
2008). We have clarified this.
Line 181 and elsewhere: i and j should be subscripts
We have subscripted i and j throughout the manuscript.
Line 261: “was determined by comparison to these trees” is unnecessarily vague. Please specify, e.g.
was calculated as the fraction of 1000 iterations w/ K = the observed value.
This sentence has been amended and now reads “by comparing the observed variance in trait values
(across phylogenetically independent contrasts) to those of the null distributions’’ as per the manual for the
picante package.
Line 290: specify Figure 3A. Also, if you could distinguish these points of interest (P. monticola) with a
different color or shape, it would be helpful. I’m assuming some individuals were in classes II and III?
We have specified this as Figure 3D (see below, while still making sure Figure 3 is cited in order), and
also pointed the reader to the figure legend, which is clearer. A single specimen of P.monticola fell into
the 3 class, whereas the others measured were all in class II, a situation we have explained in the
rd
figure caption. In order to make this exception clear as per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added a
square with a blue boundary around this point in Figure 3D, where it is easier to compare to the other
specimens of that species, and explained this as such in the figure caption.
Line 350: I recommend changing “allopatry; species thus” to “allopatry, in which case species already”
This sentence has been changed accordingly.
Line 406-7: This study doesn’t fully support your assertion, as it doesn’t compare temporal vs
frequency partitioning.
We have removed “This hypothesis is supported…” from this sentence, and it now reads: ‘In
psychophysics experiments, starlings can perceptually segregate two sound streams based only on
frequency differences’.
Line 416: What does song variability mean? Rate, structure, diel timing?
This refers to structural variability. The phrase ‘temporal partitioning’ before it was meant to refer to
rate/diel differences in song. We have added ‘structural variability of songs’ to clarify this.
Paragraph beginning 429: This is a bit redundant with previous results & intro, and could be cut down
a lot for conciseness.
We have edited the paragraph down to remove redundancies, particularly the initial 2-3 sentences
which repeated the introduction.
Line 455: Give a bit more context for this example—how many species were involved? How many size
classes (i.e how is it similar or dissimilar to your study exactly?)
Line 458: “Our comparative analysis…” this does not flow from the tinkerbird example—how does your
study compare to Kirschel’s? How are they different and why might that be?
Kirschel et al. studied character displacement in two species of tinkerbird, whose ranges partially
overlap. Size classes have not yet been described for tinkerbirds that we are aware of, in part because
no comprehensive morphological analysis of the entire genus has been undertaken. Our study differs
in studying these phenomena at the level of multispecies communities; we have made these
distinctions clear in the final paragraph. We have placed relatively little emphasis on the ‘why’ of this as
of now, because our differing conclusions could be a result of employing a wider-scale community-
level analysis of traits. Alternatively, different processes may operate in barbets and tinkerbirds, even
though they are closely related. We hope to address this question in follow-up studies.

Please find below our response to the reviewers’ comments (in blue).
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
In this revision the authors slightly rephrase conclusions (e.g. dropping the word partitioning and
instead writing of species differences), and argue that the lack of statistical testing is not important in
this article. The argument is mostly based on the descriptive results being clear, on previous papers
having provided descriptive results of a similar nature, and on working with small communities making
statistical testing difficult (see comments below).
We have included the test that the reviewer has suggested below, exactly as the reviewer has
suggested it. Basically, we constructed 10000 randomized draws of traits while keeping the community
size the same, and determined the average Cohen’s d as the reviewer suggested. We then calculated
the Z score of the observed community compared to this distribution. Please note that as far as the
morphological PC1 goes, all communities we measured are either significantly different from random
(5/6) or very close to the 0.05 significance threshold (1/6). In the case of vocal frequency, we
performed this analysis for four communities with sufficient data to calculate Cohen’s d (see earlier
revision for details on this). Again, 3 of 4 communities differed significantly from random, whereas one
did not (NE India). We report this as such, and note that a) the NE India community contained our one
exception to the observation of frequency differences (see Results, also below) as well as that our
analysis was very conservative in considering only geographical overlap and not local sympatry. In
spite of this, the fact that we still see very consistent differences from random is strongly supportive of
the case we are trying to make.
Although we maintain that this approach is not without flaws (particularly as it assumes that species
have an equal probability of overlapping, which may or may not be the case), we have included it
immediately after the discussion on Cohen’s d. We hope that this resolves this question.
Given the few changes to the manuscript, my appreciation is similar to the previous version. The main
results are summarized in this sentence from the abstract:
“We report that sympatric assemblages of Asian barbets (frugivorous canopy birds) consist of a
random phylogenetic sample of species, but are divergent in both morphological and acoustic traits.”
The first part of the sentence is well-founded, as the authors used tests of phylogenetic structure. The
second part of the sentence is unfounded, unless the observed differences among same-community
species are tested and shown to be larger than random.
We now show that the differences are significant from a random distribution across-the-board (with the
single exception detailed above), even using a very conservative criterion for community construction.
I agree with the authors that some of the descriptive results, illustrated in the figures, are clear. But
others are not, as the authors now acknowledge in the revised figure 4. Clarity of descriptive figures
should not be a reason for not conducting statistical tests, but a motivation to show those differences
statistically.
We would like to point out that there is only a single exception to the general trend (as denoted by an
asterisk in Figure 4) of vocal frequency differences. As noted in the Results, all other morphologically
or vocally similar species are not locally sympatric, being separated by habitat or altitude.
I agree that other papers have provided similar descriptive results. In some of the cited papers,
however, those descriptive results were a minor part of the paper, or were then used as data to
conduct statistically-based hypothesis-testing. Here the description of within-community differences is
the end point of the article, which renders this weakness more relevant.
I do not agree with a reply stating that small communities make it difficult to apply statistical tests. The
methods used in some of the papers mentioned in a previous round of review can be, and have been,
applied to communities with few species. Statistical tests can be very simple: for example, computing a
metric of within-community dissimilarity (perhaps mean Cohen’s d, which uses a metric already
computed in the paper; or perhaps another metric), and then comparing it to a distribution of the same
metric obtained from randomly re-assigning species to communities many times (while keeping
community size the same as the original).
As mentioned above, we have now included this test showing exactly this.
p.s.: Please note that this review was based mostly on reading the reply letter.

Comments to the Author(s)
I read this revised version of the manuscript and think it is in good shape. It is interesting
and well argued, makes good use of the literature, and I find the findings well supported
and interpreted sensibly. Below I only note some minor comments and corrections.
We thank the reviewer for the detailed critique of previous versions, and for accepting
our manuscript. Below are our responses to each comment.
Abstract and final statements of the introduction – A missing piece of information that, it
appears to me, would make readers understand better the conclusion that song divergence
is a mostly a side-effect of morphological divergence, is that body size and sound
frequency are correlated in barbets. This is only mentioned later in the discussion.
Consider noting this also in the abstract and concluding statements of the intro.
We have made sure to note this in both the abstract and the end of the introduction, and
have cited Gonzalez-Voyer et al. (2013) in the latter as well.
84, 85, also 478 – It is the other way around, I think: species in less complex
communities, not more complex communities, have larger song variability; the character
release hypothesis. See also Morinay et al 2013 Ecol Evol for a similar result.
We have corrected this error in the first instance by altering ‘variability’ to ‘stereotypy’
(i.e. greater stereotypy in complex communities), and in the second by mentioning
‘changes in structural variability’ instead of ‘an increase’.
132 – Could make this statement more precise; “phylogenetic comparative methods to
understand evolutionary patterns” is very vague…
We have changed this to ‘investigated patterns of phylogenetic signal…’
178 – I do not understand this statement. It does not make sense that range sizes are of
the order of magnitude of 0.2 degrees. Could explain better to avoid confusion by
readers.
This was a mistake from a previous version. We originally intended to convey that we
used what little information was available about home range sizes to improve our
resolution of patterns of co-occurrence, although we ended up using mainly information
about habitat preference and altitudinal distribution (which are better known, see first
paragraph of methods, “Barbet Communities”). This rather vague sentence was left over
by mistake, and we have now removed it.
233 – Good paragraph. But perhaps it does not need to be in a separate section? Could be
part of the first paragraph in the following section…
Once again, this was a result of merging the main and supplementary methods in a
previous version, and has been rectified as recommended. Many thanks for catching this!
342 – Since in the previous line Z values were reported, perhaps report both Z and P here
too for consistency.
This has been corrected to report the Z value also.
388 and Table 3 – It is strange that these three p values all the same (0.001), since K is
very different from 1 in the first two cases, but very similar to 1 in the third. Please check
this (perhaps you meant <0.001 instead?).
We have corrected this as the reviewer has suggested.
499 – Maybe rephrase here (and in the abstract also) to something like “are close to the
expected under Brownian motion”, because you did show a statistically significant
difference from K = 1.
We have made this change in both places, and also amended the relevant line in the
results to stay consistent.
Supplemental dataset 1 (morphology) – Why to report minimum and maximum values
rather than the means? Or, perhaps even better, the measurements for every specimen?
We report a min-max range instead of a mean to be conservative, and show the entire
range of values across our dataset, while still maintaining the ease of comparison with the
figure (the ‘range’ of each species in PC1-PC2 space) should the reader require it.
Ornithological literature typically reports a range of values for each trait in this way, and
we thought this would allow the reader to, for instance, easily draw the inference that
more variation in size also correlates to spread along the PC1 axis (a point we have noted
in the results as arising from comparison with the measurements).
