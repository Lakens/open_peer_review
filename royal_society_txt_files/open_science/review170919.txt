For health reasons, natural colorants are better than synthetic dyes in food industry. When using
ß-carotene as a red-orange pigment in food applications, the problem of oxidation limits its use.
The authors of this manuscript propose that oxidation of ß -carotene can be reduced by
dispersing ß-carotene into shellac matrix. Monodispersed particles containing ß-carotene and
shellac are fabricated to test the degradation time of the ß-carotene. In addition, the authors claim
that those particles will have tunable color if the concentration of ß-carotene is varied.
The method to achieve the protection of ß-carotene is very simple. The impact of this work can be
further enhanced by:
1, reviewing existing techniques to prevent the oxidation of ß-carotene;
2, comparing the effectiveness of protection of ß-carotene between the current techniques and the
new method introduced in this manuscript.
Apart from the suggestions above, followings are some questions:
- In the title, “stability” is a little bit confusing. Is it the stability of encapsulation, stability of
emulsion, or the stability of the compounds? After reading the articles, readers will know that it
refers the stability of ß-carotene against oxidation. However, this may not be entirely obvious on
first glance.

- On page 2 section 3.2 method sample preparation, the authors purified the ß-carotene using
ethanol. Why does the ß-carotene need to be purified with ethanol? Is the ethanol used to remove
the chloroform which is used to dissolve the ß-carotene?
- On page 3 first paragraph, the authors mentioned: "as the tongue is unable to resolve the texture
of the particles provided they are smaller than 20um...". I think they should provide a reference
for that.
- The authors used co-precipitation to form solid particles consisting of a shellac matrix and ß-
carotene. However, they didn't mention the effectiveness of such co-precipitation process. I am
curious about the loss of ß-carotene during the process.
-On page 3 paragraph 3, the authors used UV-vis spectroscopy to monitor the degradation of ß-
carotene. I am wondering how they can measure the UV-vis absorbance of a single particle with
the size of <50um. I think they should add the instrument they are using and the method of their
measurement.
-On page 3 last paragraph of section 4.2, the authors said the shellac particles dissolve in alkaline
water. I think they can perform a simple experiment to show how the particles dissolve in the
alkaline water. This can further support the advantage of using the shellac particles.
-On page 3 section 4.3 Particles with tunable color, the authors have used Photoshop for
measuring the spectrum change. I wonder if they can use the UV-vis absorbance measurement to
find out the spectrum change instead of using Photoshop. I think the color change from the
photos can be affected a lot by the brightness of the environment. Using a spectrometer could
probably provide a more accurate result.

Appendix B
Reply to Referees Chen et al. RSOS-170919
The authors are grateful to the referees for their detailed and thoughtful comments,
which are reproduced below and followed by our responses. The corresponding
changes are marked in red in the manuscript and the supporting information.
Reviewer: 1
The manuscript provides the new concept for the preparation of ß-carotene embedded
food grade biodegradable polymer matrix. However some point needs to be addressed
by the author.
1. In figure A, Caption do not match with the figure.
We thank the reviewer for the helpful suggestion. We have corrected the caption for
Figure 1.
2. There is no caption for fig. 1 (e)
We have added the caption for Figure 1e.
3. There are two figures named fig1
We thank the reviewer for the helpful suggestion. We have corrected this.
4. Nile red has been indicated as ß-carotene equivalent but if the size and mol
structures are compared there is much difference. Kindly address.
This is really a good question. As the reviewer suggested, the size and molecular
structure of Nile Red and ß-carotene are different. However, both Nile Red and
ß-carotene are hydrophobic, insoluble in water and both of them are small molecules
as compared to polymer. Therefore, we expect that the distribution of Nile Red in the
shellac particles is similar to that of ß-carotene. We have made this clear in the text.
5. Line 44, page 3of 11, The color.............needs to be re-fabricated.
As the reviewer suggested, we have rewritten the sentence and made it clear.
6. Caption of figure 1(b) solidification...................... Should be ‘Schematic
representation of solidification........
1
We agree. We have changed the caption of Figure 1b to “Schematic representation of
solidification…”
7. In figure S3, there is no graph for Cß-carotene=500 µg/mL.
The absorbance of Cß-carotene = 500 µg/mL is too high. Therefore, it is not shown in
Figure S3.
8. It would be appropriate to give correlation coef. r2 for the graph in figure S4.
As the reviewer suggested, we have added the correlation coefficient r2 for the graph
in Figure S4.

For health reasons, natural colorants are better than synthetic dyes in food industry.
When using ß-carotene as a red-orange pigment in food applications, the problem of
oxidation limits its use. The authors of this manuscript propose that oxidation of

Monodispersed particles containing ß-carotene and shellac are fabricated to test the
degradation time of the ß-carotene. In addition, the authors claim that those particles
will have tunable color if the concentration of ß-carotene is varied.
1. The method to achieve the protection of ß-carotene is very simple. The impact of

(2) comparing the effectiveness of protection of ß-carotene between the current

As the reviewer suggested, we have reviewed existing techniques to prevent the
oxidation of ß-carotene and compared the effectiveness of protection of ß-carotene
between the current techniques and the method introduced in this manuscript. We
have added this in the manuscript.
2. Apart from the suggestions above, followings are some questions:
(1) In the title, “stability” is a little bit confusing. Is it the stability of encapsulation,
stability of emulsion, or the stability of the compounds? After reading the articles,
readers will know that it refers the stability of ß-carotene against oxidation. However,
this may not be entirely obvious on first glance.
We agree. As the reviewer suggested, we have changed the title to “Dispersing
Hydrophobic Natural Colorant ß-carotene in Shellac Particles for Enhanced Stability
and Tunable Color”.
2
(2) On page 2 section 3.2 method sample preparation, the authors purified the
ß-carotene using ethanol. Why does the ß-carotene need to be purified with ethanol?
Is the ethanol used to remove the chloroform which is used to dissolve the
ß-carotene?
ß-carotene slowly degrades during storage. Undegraded ß-carotene is insoluble in
ethanol, while degraded ß-carotene is soluble in ethanol. We use ethanol to remove
degraded ß-carotene. We have made this clear in the text.
(3) On page 3 first paragraph, the authors mentioned: "as the tongue is unable to
resolve the texture of the particles provided they are smaller than 20um...". I think
they should provide a reference for that.
As the reviewer suggested, we have provided a reference for the statement. A report
dealing with fondants (Woodruff, S., Gilder, H. V. 1930 Photomicrographic Studies of
Sucrose Crystals. J.phys.chem. 35, 1355-1367.) specifically examined the size of
minute particles related to grittiness. It stated that “fondants were considered fine and
creamy when the sugar crystals were only 20 <U+F06D>m across, whereas those with crystals
measuring 25 <U+F06D>m were detectably crystalline”.
(4) The authors used co-precipitation to form solid particles consisting of a shellac
matrix and ß-carotene. However, they didn't mention the effectiveness of such
co-precipitation process. I am curious about the loss of ß-carotene during the process.
This is really a good question. We didn’t measure the amount of ß-carotene dissolved
in the continuous phase. However, since ß-carotene is insoluble in water, we expect
dissolution of ß-carotene in the continuous phase is negligible.
(5) On page 3 paragraph 3, the authors used UV-vis spectroscopy to monitor the
degradation of ß-carotene. I am wondering how they can measure the UV-vis
absorbance of a single particle with the size of <50um. I think they should add the
instrument they are using and the method of their measurement.
We thank the reviewer for the helpful suggestion. The method of the measurement is
now described in detail in “2.2 Methods, Stability of the encapsulated materials. After
sample preparation, equal amounts of shellac particles loaded with ß-carotene are
stored in separate vials at 4°C. To measure the UV-Vis absorption of ß-carotene, 1ml
ethyl acetate/ethanol mixture is added to each vial. The concentration of undegraded
ß-carotene in each vial is determined by the UV-Vis absorption of ß-carotene in the
ethyl acetate/ethanol mixture measured at 454 nm.
(6) On page 3 last paragraph of section 4.2, the authors said the shellac particles
dissolve in alkaline water. I think they can perform a simple experiment to show how
the particles dissolve in the alkaline water. This can further support the advantage of
3
using the shellac particles.
We thank the reviewer for the helpful suggestion. We did perform the experiment to
dissolve the particles in alkaline water. However, because we can’t track the
dissolution of individual shellac particle, we didn’t record the process. Dissolution of
shellac in alkaline water has been reported previously, and we have referenced a
paper for this statement.
(7) On page 3 section 4.3 Particles with tunable color, the authors have used
Photoshop for measuring the spectrum change. I wonder if they can use the UV-vis
absorbance measurement to find out the spectrum change instead of using Photoshop.
I think the color change from the photos can be affected a lot by the brightness of the
environment. Using a spectrometer could probably provide a more accurate result.
We agree that the color from the photos can be affected a lot by the brightness of the
environment. Therefore, we use the same condition to take the photos of the samples
and the photos are taken around the same time. Because the particles are used as
colorants, we believe it is most straightforward to show the color of the particles
directly. The measured color spectrum by Photoshop also shows that the spectrum
changes from yellow orange (Red:160, Green:110 and Blue:5) to red orange
(Red:170, Green:80 and Blue:10) is mainly attributed to the increased adsorption of
green color by ß-carotene at higher concentration.
