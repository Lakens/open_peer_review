The manuscript by Emfinger C et al describes the characteristics of the KATP channels in the
beta-cells of zebrafish. The study concludes that the electrophysiological properties and subunit
composition of zebrafish beta-cell KATP channels are very similar to these of mammals,
providing further support that glucose metabolism is conserved in zebrafish. The manuscript is
interesting, very well written and the electrophysiology data are of high quality. However, there
are a few concerns.
Major concern:
The gene expression data need improvements. As presented, it is unclear whether the PCR
products from the islet cDNA sample were from cDNA or gDNA contaminant since there was no
negative control (-reverse transcriptase) and the primers do not encompass an intron (hence the
template cannot be distinguished). New data at least one of these measures should strengthen the
authors’ conclusion and may help clarify why the KATP channels do not contain Kir6.1 and
Kir6.3. Optional quantitative RT-PCR analysis should further strengthen the results.
Minor concern:
The authors are recommended to follow zebrafish nomenclature conventions for naming
transgenic lines, genes and proteins
(https://wiki.zfin.org/display/general/ZFIN+Zebrafish+Nomenclature+Guidelines).

Comments to the author:
This work presents expression and functional analysis of K-ATP channels in zebrafish, which are
important for insulin secretion and therefore glucose homeostasis. The authors aim to provide a
basis for using zebrafish as a model organism to further explore K-ATP channel function in
insulin secretion and organism physiology. The major findings include sequence analysis and
3
islet expression analysis of Kir6.1, Kir6.2, and Kir6.3, and Sur1 and Sur2. In addition, methods for
electrophysiology on isolated zebrafish adult islet cells are demonstrated, and used to show that
K-ATP channels show activation and inhibition responses similar to their mammalian
counterparts. This reviewer considers the manuscript is appropriate for publication in Open
Science.
Minor comment:
It would be interesting to confirm cell-type specific localization of channel subunits within the
islet, through RNA in situ hybridization combined with GFP antibody staining, using the
available ins:GFP transgenic fish to identify beta cells. This could be performed on larvae or
alternatively on sections of adult islets. Given the rather robust expression of Kir6.3, it is
important to establish whether expression is exclusively associated with neurons or if it is also
present in the islet. Also, the expression of channels in non-beta cells of the islet (in particular
alpha cells) could be examined.

The authors have satisfactorily addressed my concerns. A minor point for future reference: when
perform similar RT-PCR analysis, the negative control should be a sample that has gone through
a mock cDNA synthesis with the same amount of RNA and other reagents, but without adding
the reverse transcriptase (-RT).

ase find enclosed our revised manuscript which we believe should now be suitable for
blication as a research article in the journal.
appreciate the positive comments of the reviewers and in revising the manuscript have
mprehensively addressed their concerns. Specifically, as detailed in our uploaded response
reviewers, we have now carried out experiments to show that there is no significant gDNA
tamination of cDNA samples and we have used FACS sorted eGFP-labeled <U+F062>-cells to
initively identify transcripts specifically from b-cells.
look forward to an early response!

R analysis should further strengthen the results.
appreciate the positive comments of the reviewer and fully accept the concern regarding gene
ression, We have comprehensively addressed this concern by carrying out additional PCR with exon
nning primers where possible, and using RT-free samples, as well as assessing transcript levels in
S sorted eGFP-expressing <U+F062>-cells. In the revised manuscript, we have now included a new Figure 3
d additional information Supplementary Figures 4 and 5), showing the presence of intron-containing
ds, but absence of intron-free bands in gDNA, and the opposite in cDNA. While Kir6.2 and SUR1 are
sent in islets and <U+F062>-cells, Kir6.1 and Kir6.3 are present in islets but not in <U+F062>-cells, indicating that these
es are expressed in other cell types within the islet.
