The paper of Wang et al. deals with the Enhancement on the electrochemical properties of
commercial coconut shell-based activated carbon by H2O dielectric barrier discharge plasma.
One may deplore that, finally, only one single material has been prepared and investigated. There
is neither repetition of the same, in order to check the repeatability, nor synthesis of a series of
materials in which one parameter would have been varied with some impact on the final
properties. As a result, this is a quite short studies with a very limited content for a full-length
paper. Detailed comments follow:
1. Page1, line 32; line 52, 55, the states are contradict each other;
2. Page 2, section 3.3, This section must be considerably improved because of the dramatic mack
of details. Examples are: " the temprature for degass"
3. section4.1, line 31, the isotherm type, please make sure.
4. section 4.2, the Figure 2 should be Figure 3. TEM should be Figure 4.
5. The BET method is known to overestimate the surface area of microporous materials. If the
pore size distribution has been obtained by DFT method, why not having applied the same for
determining the surface area? The corresponding result should be different and more reliable.
The same also applies to the micropore volume, VDR being always overestimated.
6. Authors should provide the details of determination of O and N content by XPS.
7. Authors should rewrite the conclusions showing parameters of the final material, which are
more important.
8. How much of weight loss during plasma treatment.
9. this paper paye close attention on the plasma midification, so only the C1s deconvoluted in
Figure 6 is not enough, the N1 and O1 should also be done as well.
one more thing, XPS analysis should have allowed a quantitative assignment of each kind of
nitrogen/carbon/oxygen instead of just a qualitative approach.
10. Did the authors study the reusability for electrochemical properties? It is important to cost
down the process.
11. It is necessary to compare the results with some recent literatures.
12. Deeper discussion of the results should be provided.
I would encourage the authors to reconsider all of these points and, after a careful review I would
encourage a resubmission.

Comments:
In this work, carbon treated by water vapor plasma is reported for EDLcs electrodes application.
The treated carbon based electrodes present a much better capacitance performance than that of
untreated. The method is creative, however, the explanation of plasma working mechanism is not
clear enough, either the enhancement of capacitance. Upon reviewing, major revision is
suggested. A few comments are as following:
Typos like missing space between value and unit (70<U+2103>, line 46, P2, 5.0mm, line 47, P2
etc.), capital letter (Rct, line 46, P4) are detected. Check carefully!
Abbreviations should be denoted at their first appearance in main text, e.g. CSAC. EDLC
is commonly the abbreviation of “electrical double layer capacitor” rather than electrical double
layer capacitance.
The Fig. numbers are in mess, do not match with the description in text.
Fig. 7d (Fig. 6 in manuscript) is not mentioned. Looks like it is the capacitance
performance test at different current density, however, more cycles, e.g. 1000 cycles for each
current density, should be provided. Otherwise, it is not sufficient to prove the good performance
at different current densities.
In electrochemical properties section, the explanation of improved capacitance
performance is concerned. It is claimed by authors that the improvement is attributed to pseudo-
capacitance owing of oxygen functional groups on carbon surface (line 22-23, P4) besides double
layer capacitance. How did the pseudo capacitance of oxygen functional groups work? What is
the the possible working mechanism? And any supporting references?
Contact angel should be measured to support the claimed improved hydrophilicity and
wettability after plasma treatment;
How is the plasma working condition come up, e.g. 160 W, 100s, 30KPa? How did these
factors affect the treatment and consequently to capacitance performance? In my experience, the
treatment time is highly related to the structure evolution.
In the XPS analysis result (Table 2), why is the atomic composition of N increasing?

Appendix A
Responses to reviewer’s comments
We appreciate the detailed and helpful comments and suggestions which are very
helpful to improve the quality of our manuscript. The manuscript (RSOS-180872) has
been carefully revised as required. All new and revised contents are highlighted with
yellow in our revised version. We hope that the correction will meet with your approval.
The point-by-point answers to the comments and suggestion were listed below.
Reviewer #1
[1] Only one single material has been prepared and investigated. There is neither
repetition of the same, in order to check the repeatability, nor synthesis of a series
of materials in which one parameter would have been varied with some impact on
the final properties. As a result, this is a quite short studies with a very limited
content for a full-length paper.
Response: According to your helpful suggestion, we have provided more
electrochemical performance data of samples prepared under different time (50 s,100
s,150 s,200 s,300 s) and power (50 W, 100 W, 130 W, 160 W, 200 W), please see the
figure below. We have conducted a serious of preliminary experiment on
electrochemical performance to select the optimum condition (100 s, 160 W). From the
results shown below, it can be concluded that the H2O dielectric barrier discharge (DBD)
plasma has ability to improve electrochemical performance of commercial coconut
shell-based activated carbon (CSAC) in a short time. The exhaustive study is very
meaningful that we are going to investigate in the future.
The electrochemical performance of CSAC modified with H2O plasma under different
time and different power is shown below (Fig. 1). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) plots
at the scan rate at 10 mV s-1 of CSAC and CSAC modified with H2O plasma are shown
in Fig. 1(a-b). The integrated area of the sample D-100 W-100 s (D means DBD plasma
modification, the first number is modification power, the second number is
modification time) is larger than other sample in the same power, indicating that 100 s
is a more suitable modification time. With modification power changing from 50 W to
200 W, the sample D-160 W-100 s exhibits the largest integrate area among all the
samples at the same modification time of 100 s. The largest integrate area of D-160 W-
100 s indicates that the sample shows the larger specific capacitance than other samples.
Furthermore, the galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) curves at the current density of
1 A g-1 of CSAC and CSAC modified with H2O plasma are shown in Fig. 1(c-d). After
calculation by the formula below, we come up the conclusion that D-160 W-100 s
exhibits the excellent specific capacitance (specific capacitance of 155.2 F g-1 at the
current density of 1 A g-1) among all the samples, which is consistent with CV curves.
The Nyquist plots of CSAC and CSAC modified with different power exhibit similar
shapes, shown in Fig. 1e. The internal resistance (Ri) of samples were below 0.4 O,
demonstrating a good electrical conductivity of materials. The increased Ri of the
sample D-160 W-100 s can be ascribed to the presence of surface oxides and thus
increase the ohmic resistance along the axial direction of micropores. Also, the smaller
diameter in the semicircle of the sample D-160 W-100 s illustrates that the lower charge
transfer resistance (Rct) at electrolyte interfaces, owing to the higher hydrophilicity after
oxygen functional groups introduced. Fig. 1f demonstrates the rate capability
(capacitance retention from the current density of 0.5 A g-1 to 10 A g-1) of CSAC and
CSAC modified under different power. The higher rate capability indicates that the
sample is capable of maintaining excellent charge and discharge characteristics at high
current density. In summary, we perform other detailed characterization of CSAC
modified by H2O plasma under modification time of 100 s and power of 160 W
(HCSAC) based on the electrochemical performance. We keep the pressure of the
reactor chamber to 30 KPa, mainly aiming to pump water into the reactor chamber
instead of maintaining the vacuum environment. Based on the above results, we select
the conditions (discharge power, 160 W; treating time, 100 s; the pressure, 30 KPa) to
make detailed analysis. We supply the result in supporting information.
The specific capacitance of the electrodes (C), was calculated by the following equation:
<U+0001D43C> × <U+2206><U+0001D461>
C=
<U+2206><U+0001D449> × <U+0001D45A>
Where C is specific capacitance (F g-1), I is the constant charge-discharge current (A),
<U+2206>t is the discharge time (s), <U+2206>V is the total change in voltage (V), m is the mass of the
active material in an electrode (g)

[2] Page1, line 32; line 52, 55, the states are contradict each other.
Response: Based on your significant suggestion, I realize that the ‘Introduction’ section
is incorrectly in expression and revised below. The sentence of ‘It should be noted that
activated carbon synthesized from coconut shell is considered better because of its
mesoporous structure which makes it suitable for its application in supercapacitor as
electrode materials’ has been revised into ‘It should be noted that coconut shell is
considered to be a suitable precursor owing to its availability, low price and ability to
create mesoporous structure in carbon materials’.
Page1, line 55 --- ‘It should be noted that coconut shell is considered to be a suitable
precursor owing to its availability, low price and ability to create mesoporous structure
in carbon materials.’
[3] Page 2, section 3.3, This section must be considerably improved because of the
dramatic mack of details. Examples are: " the temperature for degass".
Response: According to your helpful suggestion, we have added ‘The temperature for
degas is 200 <U+2103> and the time for degas is 15 h’ in ‘Materials and Methods’ section.
Similar issues have also addressed through our manuscript and the related revised
content is present below.
Page 3, line 3 --- ‘The temperature for degas is 200 <U+2103> and the time for degas is 15 h.’
Page 3, line 5 --- ‘Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100) were used to
observe the morphology of the samples. The carbon samples were added into propanol
and sonicated before dispersing on copper grid film before testing.’
Page 3, line 9 --- ‘The composition of C, N, O elements were determined by the low-
resolution spectra (0-1200 eV).’
[4] section4.1, line 31, the isotherm type, please make sure.
Response: After we consider your significant suggestion, we make sure that the
isotherm show a combined type I and IV isotherm with small H4 type hysteresis
according to the IUPAC classification. We have revised the isotherm type as shown
below[1,2].
Page 3, line 41 --- ‘Both the CSAC and HCSAC exhibit similar combined type I and
IV isotherms with small H4 type hysteresis according to the IUPAC classification.’

[6] The BET method is known to overestimate the surface area of microporous
materials. If the pore size distribution has been obtained by DFT method, why not
having applied the same for determining the surface area? The corresponding
result should be different and more reliable. The same also applies to the
micropore volume, VDR being always overestimated.
Response: Based on your significant suggestion, we realized that density functional
theory (DFT) method is more suitable than Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method for
obtaining the surface area especially for the case that we have already applied DFT
method to study the pore size distribution of carbon samples. We provide you with the
surface area revealed by DFT method. The DFT surface area of CSAC and HCSAC is
644.0 and 726.8 m2 g-1, respectively. (The BET surface area of CSAC and HCSAC is
779.8 and 846 m2 g-1, respectively.) We choose BET method instead of DFT method,
mainly owing to the fact that BET method is used widely in other reports[1-3]. It is
convenient for us to compare our data with the value in other reports, so that we can
understand the activated carbon performance clearly.

[7] Authors should provide the details of determination of O and N content by XPS.
Response: After we considered your helpful suggestions, the details of determination
of O and N by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are provided. The XPS spectra
of CSAC and HCSAC is shown in Fig. 2. As presented in the figure below, the relative
proportion of surface oxygen, nitrogen and carbon elements are calculated by the
integrate area of each element divided by the integrate area of all the elements (C, O,
N), respectively. Also, we have added the details in the ‘Materials and Methods’ section.

[9] How much of weight loss during plasma treatment.
Response: There is no weight loss of CSAC during plasma treatment owing to the low
discharge power (160W) utilized in our experiment[1,2]. The BET surface area, total
pore volume and average pore size exhibit unremarkable changes after H2O plasma
modification. The physical structure without significant changes indicates that H2O
plasma treatment can hardly cause weight loss of CASC.

[10] This paper pays close attention on the plasma modification, so only the C1s
deconvoluted in Figure 6 is not enough, the N1 and O1 should also be done as well.
one more thing, XPS analysis should have allowed a quantitative assignment of
each kind of nitrogen/carbon/oxygen instead of just a qualitative approach.
Response: According to your helpful suggestion, we present the quantitative
assignment of O1s and N 1s as shown below (Fig. 3 and Table 1). As shown in Fig. 3(a-
b), the O 1s spectrum of CSAC and HCSAC can be resolved into three individual peaks
based on the previous literature (531.3 eV, carbonyl and/or quinone; 532.7 eV, hydroxyl
and/or ether; 534.0 eV, chemisorbed oxygen and/or water)[1]. As shown in Fig. 3(c-d),
the N1s spectrum can be fitted by three peaks (398.2 eV, pyridinic nitrogen; 399.9 eV,
pyrrolic nitrogen; 400.9 eV, quaternary nitrogen)[2]. The nitrogen content of HCSAC
show slightly changes in comparison with CSAC. Table 1 presents the composition of
the oxygen and nitrogen chemical functional groups of CSAC and HCSAC. The
obvious increment of carbonyl and carboxyl can be ascribed to the ions excited from
the H2O molecule during H2O plasma modification. The results from the deconvoluted
C1s spectrum is more significant in this manuscript than that from O1s and N1s.
However, according to your suggestion, we supply the results of deconvoluted O1s and
N1s in supporting information.

[11] Did the authors study the reusability for electrochemical properties? It is
important to cost down the process.
Response: After taking your helpful suggestion into account, we supply the life cycles
of HCSAC electrode at different current density for 1000 cycles, shown in Fig. 4. The
capacitance retention of CSAC modified by H2O plasma (HSCAC) electrodes maintain
over 97% in the 6.0 M KOH electrolyte. The high capacitance retention indicates that
ideal interconnected porous structure generating high ion transmission efficiency in
HCSAC. Also, we supply this figure in supporting information.

[12] It is necessary to compare the results with some recent literatures.
Response: According to your helpful suggestion, we provide the electrochemical
properties (specific capacitance and rate capability (capacitance retention at the current
density from 0.5 A g-1 to 10 A g-1)) of activated carbon in some recent literatures (shown
in Table 2). The CSAC utilized in our experiment exhibits low specific capacitance can
be ascribed to commercial activated carbon is generally physically activated by steam
or carbon dioxide. The biomass derived carbon materials prepared from harsh
experimental environment commonly adopt chemical activation (KOH activation
adopted in the references below), listed in Table 2[1-4]. The rate capability of CSAC was
improved from 76.7% to 84.6% and an increment of 64.8% in specific capacitance after
H2O plasma modification. Furthermore, we are capable of applying this H2O plasma
modification in other activated carbon electrode materials to improve specific
capacitance and rate capability.
Furthermore, the nitric acid treatment introducing oxygen containing functional group
to activated carbon need long heating duration, extra energy consumption and
utilization of chemical reagents[5,6]. In comparison to the reported modifying method,
the H2O plasma modification used in our experiment can improve the electrochemical
properties of CSAC with a short time (100 s) and pollution-free media (H2O).

[13] Deeper discussion of the results should be provided.
Response: Based on your significant suggestion, we supply the three-dimensional
schematic model of the functional groups of HCSAC (shown in Fig. 5). The oxygen
functional groups and nitrogen functional groups are presented in the figure below.
The additional pseudo-capacitance is attributed to oxygen functional groups. Previous
studies demonstrate that some oxygen functional groups can directly participate in
faradaic reactions not only in acidic medium[1] but alkaline medium[2]. The increased
oxygen functional groups in HCSAC play an important role in the enhancement of
capacitance via reversible redox actions in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The inductive effects
of oxygen containing functional groups’ bonds structure is capable of causing the
electrons redistribution and some bonds polarization. The electric potential induced
redox reactions of polarized sites proceed through the simultaneously reversible
gaining/losing of electrons and adsorption/desorption of protons, respectively[3,4]. This
deeper discussion has been added to the ‘Result and discussion’ section. The supporting
references are listed below.

performance test at different current density, however, more cycles, e.g. 1000
cycles for each current density, should be provided. Otherwise, it is not sufficient
to prove the good performance at different current densities.
Response: According to your kind remind, we realize that Fig. 7d (Fig. 6 in manuscript)
has been analyzed, but we forget to mention this figure number. we add the figure

After considering your significant suggestions, we add the life cycles of HCSAC

retention indicates that ideal interconnected porous structure generating high ion

information.

[5] In electrochemical properties section, the explanation of improved capacitance
performance is concerned. It is claimed by authors that the improvement is
attributed to pseudo-capacitance owing of oxygen functional groups on carbon
surface (line 22-23, P4) besides double layer capacitance. How did the pseudo
capacitance of oxygen functional groups work? What is the possible working
mechanism? And any supporting references?
Response: Based on your significant suggestions, we provide the possible working
mechanism of oxygen functional groups in the manuscript. The additional pseudo-
capacitance is attributed to oxygen functional groups. Previous studies demonstrate that
some oxygen functional groups can participate directly in faradaic reactions not only in
acidic medium[1] but alkaline medium[2]. The increased oxygen functional groups in
HCSAC play an important role in the enhancement of capacitance via reversible redox
actions in 6 M KOH electrode. The inductive effects of oxygen containing functional
groups’ bonds structure is capable of causing the electrons redistribution and some
bonds polarization. In 6 M KOH electrolyte, the electric potential induced redox
reactions of polarized sites proceed through the simultaneously reversible
gaining/losing of electrons and adsorption/desorption of protons, respectively[3,4]. This

[6] Contact angel should be measured to support the claimed improved
hydrophilicity and wettability after plasma treatment;
Response: Based on your helpful suggestions, we try to carry on the contact angle
measurement. We have failed in pressing the powder into full tablet and thus the test
results are not convincing. However, we have found supporting references to support
the claim that hydrophilicity and wettability are improved after plasma modification.
The oxygen functional groups can provide an extra pseudo-capacitance through
revisable redox reaction and improved wettability between the electrodes and
electrolytes[1-3]. The presence of surface oxygen functional groups is advantageous for
improving the hydrophilicity of carbon material which would increase the surface area
accessible to aqueous electrolyte[4-6].

[7] How is the plasma working condition come up, e.g. 160 W, 100 s, 30 KPa? How
did these factors affect the treatment and consequently to capacitance
performance? In my experience, the treatment time is highly related to the
structure evolution.
Response: According to your helpful suggestions, we have provided more
electrochemical performance data of samples prepared under different time (50 s,100
s,150 s,200 s,300 s) and power (50 W, 100 W, 130 W, 160 W, 200 W), please see the
figure below. We have conducted a serious of preliminary experiment on
electrochemical performance to select the optimum condition (100 s, 160 W). From the
results shown below, it can be concluded that the H2O dielectric barrier discharge (DBD)
plasma has ability to improve electrochemical performance of commercial coconut
shell-based activated carbon (CSAC) in a short time. The exhaustive study is very
meaningful that we are going to investigate in the future.
The electrochemical performance of CSAC modified with H2O plasma under different
time and different power is shown below (Fig. 2). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) plots
at the scan rate of 10 mV s-1 of CSAC and CSAC modified with H2O plasma are shown
in Fig. 2(a-b). The integrated area of the sample D-100 W-100 s (D means DBD plasma
modification, the first number is modification power, the second number is
modification time) is larger than other sample in the same power, indicating that 100 s
is a more suitable modification time. With modification power changing from 50 W to
200 W, the sample D-160 W-100 s exhibits the largest integrate area among all the
samples in the same modification time of 100 s. The largest integrate area of D-160 W-
100 s indicates that the sample shows the larger specific capacitance than other samples.
Furthermore, the galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) curves of CSAC and CSAC
modified with H2O plasma at the current density of 1 A g-1 are shown in Fig. 2(c-d).
After calculation by the formula below, we come up the conclusion that D-160 W-100
s exhibits the excellent specific capacitance among all the samples, which is consistent
with CV curves. The Nyquist plots of CSAC and CSAC modified with different power
exhibit similar shapes, shown in Fig. 2e. The internal resistance (Ri) of samples were
below 0.4 O, demonstrating a good electrical conductivity of materials. The increased
Ri of the sample D-160 W-100 s can be ascribed to the presence of surface oxides and
thus increase the ohmic resistance along the axial direction of micropores. Also, the
smaller diameter in the semicircle of the sample D-160 W-100 s illustrates that the lower
charge transfer resistance (Rct) at electrolyte interfaces, owing to the higher
hydrophilicity after oxygen functional groups introduced. Fig. 2f demonstrates the rate
capability (capacitance retention from the current density of 0.5 A g-1 to 10 A g-1) of
CSAC and CSAC modified under different power. The higher rate capability indicates
that the sample is capable of maintaining excellent charge and discharge characteristics
at high current density. In summary, we perform other detailed characterization of
CSAC modified by H2O plasma under modification power of 160 W and time of 100 s
(HCSAC) based on the electrochemical performance. We keep the pressure of the
reactor chamber to 30 KPa, mainly aiming to pump water into the reactor chamber
instead of maintaining the vacuum environment. Based on the above results, we select
the conditions (discharge power, 160 W; treating time, 100 s; the pressure, 30 KPa) to
make detailed analysis. We supply the result in supporting information.
The specific capacitance of the electrodes (C), was calculated by the following equation:
<U+0001D43C> × <U+2206><U+0001D461>

[8] In the XPS analysis result (Table 2), why is the atomic composition of N
increasing?
Response: The definite parameters of our experiment are determined by a serious of
preliminary experiments. The results shown in this article were obtained by one
experiment. According to your helpful suggestion, we consider that the increasing
nitrogen content may be ascribed to experimental error. We perform X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) test to CSAC and HCSAC for five times,
respectively. Afterwards, we delete smallest and largest values and take the average of
the three times results. The nitrogen atomic composition is listed below (Table 1), the
average value of CSAC and HCSAC is 1.04% and 1.58%, respectively (the value in
our manuscript of CSAC and HCSAC is 1.6% and 2.8%, respectively). The nitrogen
content is much lower when compared with oxygen and carbon content. So, nitrogen
play a relatively minor role in this experiment.

Responses to reviewer’s comments
We appreciate the detailed and helpful comments and suggestions which are very
helpful to improve the quality of our manuscript. The manuscript (RSOS-180872.R2)
has been carefully revised as required. All new and revised contents are highlighted
with yellow in our revised version. We hope that the correction will meet with your
approval. The point-by-point answers to the comments and suggestion were listed
below.
Reviewer #2
[1] I am satisfied with the modifications made by authors according to my
comments, and it can be accepted on condition the supplementary figures,
discussions and references are wrapped up with the manuscript. Otherwise, the
manuscript is quite short, hardly to be a full-length research paper with few
substantial contents.
Response: According to your helpful suggestion, we supplied the part of supplementary
figures, discussions and references into our revised manuscript. For example, the
quantitative assignment of O1s and N 1s, the three-dimensional schematic model of the
functional groups of HCSAC (commercial coconut shell-based activated carbon
modified with H2O plasma) and the life cycles of HCSAC electrode at different current
density for 1000 cycles were supplied in the revised manuscript, shown in Fig.1, Fig.
2, Fig. 3 and Table below. (Listed as Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 9 and Table 2 in our revised
manuscript, respectively.).

[2] Did the authors measure the mass of samples before and after plasma
treatment? Besides, 160 W is not low and there will be mass loss based on my
experience on plasma processing.
Response: Based on your significant suggestion, we re-weighed the mass of samples
before and after treatment.
The weight loss rate of sample (W), was calculated by the following equation:
<U+0001D465>-<U+0001D466>
<U+0001D44A>=
<U+0001D467>
Where <U+0001D465> is the weight of the whole reactor chamber including the sample before
plasma treatment (g), <U+0001D466> is the weight of the whole reactor chamber including the
sample after plasma treatment (g), <U+0001D467> is the weight of the sample.
After weighing for three times, the average of <U+0001D465> was 138.4310 g, the average of <U+0001D466>
was 138.4309 g, the weight of sample is 0.5 g, the difference between <U+0001D465> and <U+0001D466> is too
small and beyond their accuracy. The results indicate that 160 W can hardly cause
weight loss of activated carbon.
