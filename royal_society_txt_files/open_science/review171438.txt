This manuscript proposes a quantitative reliability modeling and analysis method for multi-state
element based on the Markov chain (MC) and dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). The
corresponding reliability parameters are also obtained for different repair models. Two different
modeling (DFT modeling and DBN modeling) for control unit are studied for validating the
reliability of the proposed model. The study is interesting and meaningful, I think this article can
be considered to be published in Royal Society Open Science according to the suggestions:
1. The spelling and grammar of this article need to be improved.
2. The symbols and labels in Figure 9 to Figure 11 should be more prominent and obvious.
3. More comparable results between the traditional model and this novel model can be added.

The paper is missing mathematical rigour. Mathematical objects la DBN, reliability function,
Markov chains should be defined in the preliminaries of the paper. For example, the concept of
reliability function has different definitions in the literature according to the context. The reader
cannot guess what sort of function is used and why.
The state space g of performance has an order relation. How is this order related to the failure
rank. Again, this might be deduced from the calculations, but clarification from the beginning is
necessary.
Another aspect is the connection between Markov models and DBN. There is no clear
3
result/theorem that characterises this relation.
The paper looks quite informal, with no proofs.
For reliability, there exist plenty of models, simpler or complex, why for the multi-state element,
only MC and DBN are considered?
The paper needs to be rewritten from the scratches, with background, motivation, results, and
conclusions.

Associate Editor's comments:
Thank you for your submission. We have received two reports. One is positive except for asking
for improvements to the presentation, but it hardly addresses the substance of the paper. The
other asks for a complete rewrite to set the paper in context and to explain the concepts used in
mathematical terms. I have read the paper myself and although I am not expert in the area, I feel
it has merit. So I would invite the authors to make a major revision to address these points and
on receipt, I would seek some further reviews.

The novelty of the paper is not clearly stated. The authors have to underline their theoretical and
practical contribution. It is not the reviewer task to derive what is new in the paper. Is the use of
Markov models or DBN, or their combination? What is the relevance of their modelling approach
for the case study? Can their results be comparable with other approaches for the same case
study?
I believe that the nice explanations given as answers to the reviewers should be encapsulated in

Dear Alice Power,
Thanks for your reminder. It’s so kind of you.
After receiving comments from the reviewers, we dedicate ourselves to revise our manuscript
("Reliability modeling and analysis of multi-state element based on dynamic Bayesian network").
According to all of the reviewers’ and editor’s comment, a major revision is made by adding
notations and acronyms to explain mathematical concepts, improving the spelling and grammar
with a professional expert, offering more details to verify our model and so on. Suggestions and
problems stressed by reviewers’ are answered one by one as follows. And additional sections such
as ethics statement, data accessibility, competing interests are also checked.
Thank you again for your kindness. And we are looking forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,

3. More comparable results between the traditional model and this novel model can be added.
Review report according to the comments from reviewer 1:
Dear reviewer,
Thank you for your comments on our manuscript ("Reliability modeling and analysis of
multi-state element based on dynamic Bayesian network").
Our review report according to your comments is listed as follows:
1. Before submitting to Royal Society Open Science, we asked JVE International for extending
editing of our English language. However, it still has some problems. So after revising our
manuscript, we have asked a professor in related domain to offer suggestions for us in spelling and
grammar. The screenshot of our English language editing certification for the first time is shown
as follow. Because the latter language editing is done in private, there is no certification.
2. To avoid confusion for readers, curves in Figure 9 to Figure 11 in the original manuscript are
redrawn with different colors for different curves. Because two figures are added in our revised
manuscript, the sequence numbers for these three figures are changed. Figure 9 to Figure 11 in the
original manuscript are referred to Figure 10, Figure 12 and Figure 13 in the revised manuscript.
In addition, during the revision we find a place of negligence in our original manuscript that the
vertical coordinate in Figure 9 in the original manuscript (Figure 10 in our revised manuscript)
should be “Probability” instead of “Reliability”. By solving the differential equations established
according to Markov processes, we obtain the probabilities of element E1 in different states. After
setting a desired performance demand or an absorbing set, we can determine the reliability of
element E1 in different repair modes. Figures after revision are shown as follow.

3. In Section 5.1, more details are added to verify our model. For element E1, there are six
kinds of Markov processes for no repair after failure, with perfect repair, with imperfect repair,
under conditional-based maintenance, taking the fault state as an absorbing state and taking the
psendo-fault state and the fault state as an absorbing state. The Markov processes are presented as:

The DBN model for element E1 is relatively simple shown in Fig. 11, with a node at time slice
t0 and a node at time slice t. Different repair modes can be denoted by different conditional
probability tables (CPTs) according to Table 1-6 in the manuscript. By referring forward with
software BayesiaLab, probability curves of different states are obtained that are overlapped
completely with the curves determined by Markov processes, which verifies the correctness of our
model.

Fig. 11. DBN model for element E1 in different repair modes
Also, UGF has been applied to verify the DBN model of the control unit. On the base of
Markov processes, performance distributions of all the elements in the control unit can be
determined in polynomial form. By constructing the overall model of the control unit considering
its logic gates, the performance distributions of the entire MSS under desired demand performance
level are obtained through like-terms collection and a recursive procedure which are overlapped
completely with the results in Fig. 12. Compared with that of UGF, the application of DBN
reduces a lot calculation and offers a more vivid result.
Thank you again for your comments. Best wishes to you.

Comments to the Author(s)
1. The paper is missing mathematical rigour. Mathematical objects in DBN, reliability function,
Markov chains should be defined in the preliminaries of the paper. For example, the concept of
reliability function has different definitions in the literature according to the context. The reader
cannot guess what sort of function is used and why.
2. The state space g of performance has an order relation. How is this order related to the failure
rank. Again, this might be deduced from the calculations, but clarification from the beginning is
necessary.
3. Another aspect is the connection between Markov models and DBN. There is no clear
result/theorem that characterises this relation.
4. The paper looks quite informal, with no proofs.
5. For reliability, there exist plenty of models, simpler or complex, why for the multi-state
element, only MC and DBN are considered?
The paper needs to be rewritten from the scratches, with background, motivation, results, and
conclusions.
Review report according to the comments from reviewer 2:
Dear reviewer,
Thank you for your comments on our manuscript ("Reliability modeling and analysis of
multi-state element based on dynamic Bayesian network").
Our review report according to your comments is listed as follows:
1. Notations and Acronyms are added at the end of Section 1 shown as follows. And the concept
of reliability, Bayesian network, dynamic Bayesian network, Markov process is also given in the
introduction of this paper.
Reliability: Reliability of a system or an element is defined as: the ability to perform its
required functions under specific operating conditions for a specified period of time.
Bayesian network: Developed on the base of probability and graph theory, Bayesian network
has advantages in performing forward or predictive analysis, backward or diagnostic analysis, and
expressing uncertain causal relations. And all causal relations can be denoted by conditional
probability distributions obtained by consulting experts or referring to recorded failure data.
Dynamic Bayesian network: By introducing relevant temporal dependencies between
representations, BN is expanded into dynamic Bayesian network.
Markov process: The Markov processes are widely used because the number of failures in
arbitrary time intervals can be described as a Poisson process and the corresponding time to failure
and repair are assumed to obey exponential distribution.
After discussing with colleagues, we decide to use “Markov process” instead of “Markov
chain”. Because in our manuscript the state transitions of multi-state elements are depicted in the
form of Markov process.
In addition, the concept of reliability function in the manuscript is only defined in Eq. (3) to
avoid confusion for readers. The definition is denoted as:
If the constant demand is gi <U+F03C> w <U+F0A3> gi <U+F02B>1 , i <U+F03D> 1,2, , k <U+F02D> 1 , the reliability function is denoted as
i k
Ri (t ) <U+F03D> 1 <U+F02D> <U+F0E5> p j (t ) <U+F03D> <U+F0E5> p (t )

2. In the manuscript, the state space g of performance is defined as: an element has k
different states corresponding to its performance rates, denoted by the set g <U+F03D> <U+F07B>g1 , g2 , , gk <U+F07D> with
an ascending order. Herein, g k represents the perfect functionality state of the element, and g1
represents the complete failure state. The intermediate value gi (1 <U+F03C> i <U+F03C> k ) denotes a state of
degradation. At any instant, the performance rate G(t ) of an element is a random variable taking
a value from g , i.e., G(t ) <U+F0CE> g . Then, the corresponding relation between the state number and
element degradation is determined.
In many modern systems such as power systems, communication systems and computer
systems, definition and clarification of performance states are given according to its generating
capacity, communication or data processing speed. In our manuscript, the definition and
clarification are determined by analyzing the testing parameters of the control unit and consulting
domain experts.
3. Markov process is applied to determine the dynamic characteristic parameters of MSEs or
single multi-state element systems in the domain of reliability. However, when it comes to MSS
with lots of elements, state explosion problem will appear in Markov process.
With advantages in simplifying the state-transition in the stochastic process, (dynamic)
Bayesian network can describe any MSE or MSS with a single node. Even there are several kinds
of Markov processes for any MSE including failure with repair, with perfect repair, with imperfect
repair, under conditional-based maintenance, DBN model for the element at different time slices is
denoted with a node at time slice t0 and a node at time slice t. For MSS, all causal relations can be
denoted by conditional probability distributions determined by logic gates, failure data or domain
experts. And by referring forward, reliability parameters of MSS can be obtained which reduces a
lot of calculation.
The relations between Markov process models and DBN lie in that the former are applied to
determine the dynamic characteristics of MSE and the latter is applied to obtain the reliability
indexes of the whole system.
4. In Section 5.1, more details are added to verify our model. For element E1, there are six
kinds of Markov processes for no repair after failure, with perfect repair, with imperfect repair,
under conditional-based maintenance, taking the fault state as an absorbing state and taking the
psendo-fault state and the fault state as an absorbing state. The Markov processes are presented as:

Fig. 10. Reliability curves of element E1 in different repair modes
The DBN model for element E1 is relatively simple shown in Fig. 11, with a node at time slice
t0 and a node at time slice t. Different repair modes can be denoted by different conditional
probability tables (CPTs) according to Table 1-6 in the manuscript. By referring forward with
software BayesiaLab, probability curves of different states are obtained that are overlapped
completely with the curves determined by Markov processes, which verifies the correctness of our
model.

Also, UGF has been applied to verify the DBN model of the control unit. On the base of
Markov processes, performance distributions of all the elements in the control unit can be
determined in polynomial form. By constructing the overall model of the control unit considering
its logic gates, the performance distributions of the entire MSS under desired demand performance
level are obtained through like-terms collection and a recursive procedure which are overlapped
completely with the results in Fig. 12. Compared with that of UGF, the application of DBN
reduces a lot calculation and offers a more vivid result.
5. There are many methods to perform reliability analysis such as FTA, BDD, FMEA. But these
methods are mainly used in binary state systems, i.e., systems with only normal and failure. With
systems becoming complex and sophisticated, especially when redundant design and dynamic
logic gates are adopted, higher reliability requirement is put forward. Traditional binary states
methods cannot meet the requirement anymore which neglect several intermediate states between
the perfect functionality and complete failure. What’s more, for many types of equipment, binary
states methods lead to a waste of information.
So far, there are several methods to model for MSE such as Markov process, go-flow and DFT.
Among them, Markov process is most widely used. For MSE, during the stationary phase of the
bathtub curve of an element, Markov process can depict the state transition processes and the
corresponding time to failure and repair are assumed to obey exponential distribution. It’s easy
and practical to calculate the probabilities of MSE in different states by solving differential
equations. During the decline phase of the bathtub curve of an element, modified Markov process
can be applied such as semi-Markov process and non-homogenous continuous time Markov model.
However, go-flow and DFT become complex to analyze MSE and MSS, especially when lots of
dynamic logic gates are introduced.
Universal generating functions (UGF), another widely used reliability analysis method for MSS,
has been applied to verify the DBN model of the control unit. Universal generating function (UGF)
is also widely used in reliability analysis. As a highly efficient analytical tool to describe
multi-state elements and construct the overall model of complex MSS, UGF allows one to find the
entire MSS performance distribution based on the performance distributions of its elements in
polynomial form. The core idea of UGF is to express the discrete random variables using algebraic
procedures. Through like-terms collection and a recursive procedure, the reliability of the system
under desired demand performance level can be obtained by using polynomial assemble operator,
and its computational burden is reduced obviously. For more detail, literatures [1-5] listed at the
end of the report are available.
On the base of Markov processes, performance distributions of all the elements in the control
unit can be determined in polynomial form. By constructing the overall model of the control unit
considering its logic gates, the performance distributions of the entire MSS under desired demand
performance level are obtained through like-terms collection and a recursive procedure which are
overlapped completely with the results in Fig. 12.
However, UGF has difficulty when dynamic logic gates such as cold spare gate, warm spare
gate and trigger gate are involving in MSS. In addition, if causal relationships between nodes are
uncertain in MSS, UGF is not available either. (Dynamic) Bayesian network overcomes these
problems mentioned above. Because it is developed on the base of probability and graph theory,
there is no doubt on its correctness and preciseness. And Bayesian network has advantages in
performing forward and backward to make prediction and find out weak points. There are many
methods to obtain its conditional probability distributions, such as by consulting experts or
reasoning with recorded data. Thus, compared with UGF, DBN model is adopted which reduces a
lot calculation and offers a more vivid result.
Thank you again for your comments. Best wishes to you.

Comments to the Author(s):
The novelty of the paper is not clearly stated. The authors have to underline their theoretical and
practical contribution. It is not the reviewer task to derive what is new in the paper. Is the use of
Markov models or DBN, or their combination? What is the relevance of their modeling approach
for the case study? Can their results be comparable with other approaches for the same case study?
Review report according to the comments from the reviewer:
Dear reviewer,
Thank you for your comments on our manuscript ("Reliability modeling and analysis of
multi-state element based on dynamic Bayesian network").
(1) Our paper presents a quantitative reliability modeling and analysis method for multi-state
elements (MSEs) on the basis of the Markov process and dynamic Bayesian network (DBN),
taking perfect repair, imperfect repair and condition-based maintenance (CBM) into consideration.
The novelty of our manuscript lies in the application of the combination of Markov model and
DBN. According to state-transition relations between states determined by Markov process,
probability functions of MSEs in different states can be determined after solving differential
equations. And DBN model can be established according to dynamic fault tree (DFT) of MSS.
Abstract after revision is shown as: This paper presents a quantitative reliability modeling and
analysis method for multi-state elements (MSEs) based on the combination of the Markov process and
dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), taking perfect repair, imperfect repair and condition-based
maintenance (CBM) into consideration. Markov models of elements without repair and under CBM are
established, and an absorbing set is introduced to determine the reliability of the repairable element.
According to state-transition relations between states determined by the Markov process, a DBN model
is built. And its parameters for series and parallel systems, namely conditional probability tables
(CPTs), can be calculated by referring to conditional degradation probabilities. At last, power in failure
of a control unit is taken for an example. Its dynamic fault tree (DFT) is translated into a Bayesian
network (BN) model, and extended to DBN subsequently. The results show the state probabilities of an
element and the system without repair, with perfect and imperfect repair, under CBM, with an
absorbing set plotted by differential equations and verified. Through referring forward, the reliability
value of the control unit is determined in different kinds of modes. Finally, weak nodes are pointed out
in the control unit.
Part of our conclusion after revision is shown as: In this paper, a method of modeling a MSS using
the Markov process and DBN is proposed, taking perfect repair, imperfect repair and CBM into
account. The reliability parameter can be obtained by fusing the same parameters of elements with
multi-states, and it can be predicted easily from the dynamic functions. When applying traditional
methods, repetitive computation is required which costs lots of time.
(2) In the part of case study, a control unit with power in failure is analyzed. In Section 4.1, a
DFT model for the control unit is established, and then corresponding DBN model is built in
Section 4.2. In Section 5.1, MSE E1 and the MSS are taken for example to verify our model and
perform reliability analysis. In addition, importance analysis is performed to point out weak nodes
in design in Section 5.2. The case study reflects the application of our approach.
(3) In the case study, for MSE results obtained from Markov process and DBN modeling are
compared. They are equal. In addition, the results of the control unit are compared with those
obtained by using universal generating functions (UGF) which can be performed by referring to
references [33-35]. The advantage of our method is obvious that by applying BN software it’s easy to
obtain the reliability values vividly.
Thank you again for your comments. Best wishes to you.
