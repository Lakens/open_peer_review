The authors report the ratiometric fluorescent probe consist of blue-emission silicon nanocrystal
(Si CNs) and red-emission carbon dots (r-CDs) for detecting Hg2+. To improve food safety and
environmental protection, the development of fluorescent Hg2+ probes has attracted attention.
Although the fluorescent probe based on Si CNs and r-CDs is consist of very simple system, it
can detect Hg2+ with highly selective and sensitive. Therefore, this paper would be helpful for
some researchers. It seems suitable to accept this manuscript for the publication of Royal Society
Open Science after revision concerning the points shown below.
1. In Figure 1, the fluorescence intensity of c (Si CNs + r-CDs) at 445 nm is stronger than that of a
(Si CNs). What is the reason ?
2. The reviewer is interested in the fluorescence change with the probe and methylmercury.

posed during the first review round, the authors have strived to indicate what is really the
novelty of their work. Indeed there is a need for new methodologies allowing for cheap, fast and
easy detection of Hg ions. The authors have now addressed this issue and made the aim of the

etric Fluorescent Test Paper Based on Silicon Nanocrystals and Carbon Dots for Sensitive Determination
uic Ions”
Guo, Liu Cui, Nian Li, Shudong Zhang, Zhenyang Wang
ary:
Guo et al. present a potentially low cost, point of use method for measuring Hg2+ using silicon and
nanomaterials. The key innovation is the use of the carbon dots as an internal standard. The
cence of the silicon and carbon dots causes a color change (rather than an intensity change) that can
ly detected with the naked eye (albeit with a UV lamp to excite the nanomaterials). I think this paper is
teresting and potentially novel, but have some concerns that should be addressed prior to publication.
d comments:
The English needs work. There are numerous typographical and grammatical errors.
The organization of the results section makes the results difficult to interpret. The figures are not
explained in detail and leave the reader to interpret too much information on their own. In addition, the
amount of results in the supplementary information is very high and makes the paper difficult to read.
The introduction could use an additional paragraph that places this work in the context of other paper-
based (or otherwise inexpensive) methods for Hg2+ determination. The authors scantly mention anodic
stripping voltammetry, which is widely used, is low cost, and typically able to be performed in situ.
The data for NP size is inadequate. To simply say the NCs range in size from 3-5 nm is extremely
sloppy. They have TEM data for the NPs, so they should generate the sizes from the data using a
statistically relevant number of samples and plot that as a histogram. The size of the NPs should be
reported with its uncertainty in the manuscript. The same argument is made for the carbon dots
The authors do not describe how the size of the nanomaterials impact the results. This is important in
the context of batch-to-batch consistency. For instance, their Si NCs are listed as 3-5 nm, but how
consistent is this synthesis? If there is a 20% size difference from batch to batch, what will the expected
changes in fluorescence intensity/emission wavelength be? This must be specifically addressed in the
manuscript and supported with evidence.
Fig 1. Why does the fluorescence signal at 445 nm increase when the C dots are present (compare
curve C vs. curve A)?
Fig. 1 should include the TEM images for the C and Si nanomaterials.
In the discussion of Fig. 2, the sensitivity, intercept and correlation coefficient should be explicitly
stated. These are tremendously important metrics for any analytical technique and a presentation of a
method without this information is sloppy.
Scheme 1. Is there any evidence to support the authors claim that the nanocrystals assemble in this
way? If the schematic is based on evidence, it should be shown; if the schematic is based on
conjecture, it should be stated clearly in the figure caption.
Fig. 3 is not presented well. What is the difference between selectivity and interference? This should be
clarified and presented in a way that is consistent with the analytical chemistry literature.
Fig. 3. What is the reason for the selectivity of Hg over the other ions? If the Hg complex forms much
more strongly with the amino groups, surely there should be some response from the other species?
Surely there is data to suggest that other metal species should form complexes with the amino groups?
Fig. 3. There is an inconsistency between the figure caption and the text. The caption says the
interfering ions are present at a concentration of 2 µM, while the text says 0.1 mM (Page 3, line 50-51).

mments: 1) The authors report on a fluorescent test for Hg ions. Even though the experimental
t of the work is sound, I cannot see the novelty of this work as there are numerous recent
ntific papers describing similar tests for Hg ions (a heavily studied case due to the high toxicity
his species).
swer: As well known, Mercury is a toxic heavy metal, and it can be caused permanent damage
he human body even at a very low concentration. The widely used methods are high sensitivity
selectivity, but they are usually expensive, time-consuming, require tedious sample
treatments and expensive equipments operated by well-trained technicians. The fluorescent test
er has attracted gradually increasing attention in recent years. However, a single-colorful
rescent probe only can display the change of fluorescence brightness by either “turn on” or
rn off” with Hg2+. An accurate/visual quantification mainly depends on the color variations
er than only brightness, because our eye is more sensitive to colors. Therefore, our work focus
based on ratiometric fluorescence probe and a paper-based sensor for the determination of Hg2+
a dosage-sensitive color evolution, Hg2+ can be detected by the simultaneous changes in
rescence intensity and color. Moreover, it didn’t require tedious sample pretreatments,
ensive instrument and the detection limit was 7.63 nM, which exhibits an on-site, sensitive
hod and rapid, and cost-effective for the visualization determination of Hg2+ by the naked eye.
refore, the novelty of the current work has been added to further render the paper rational and
ple in background of fluorescent test for Hg ions.
mments: 2) the language used in this manuscript needs significant attention prior to any further
lication attempt.
swer: Thanks for raising this point. The language used in this manuscript has been polished
efully in the revised manuscript.

mments: The authors report the ratiometric fluorescent probe consist of blue-emission silicon
ocrystal (Si CNs) and red-emission carbon dots (r-CDs) for detecting Hg2+. To improve food

ety and environmental protection, the development of fluorescent Hg2+ probes has attracted

tem, it can detect Hg2+ with highly selective and sensitive. Therefore, this paper would be
pful for some researchers. It seems suitable to accept this manuscript for the publication of Royal
iety Open Science after revision concerning the points shown below.
estion 1: In Figure 1, the fluorescence intensity of curve 3 (Si CNs + r-CDs) at 445 nm is
nger than that of curve 1 (Si CNs). What is the reason?
swer: Thanks for raising this point. Actually, the fluorescence intensity of curve 3 (Si CNs +
Ds) at 445 nm is not stronger than that of curve 1 (Si CNs). In Figure 1, curve 1 showed the
rescence peak of Si CNs at 445 nm and emit blue fluorescence, curve 3 displayed the (Si CNs +
Ds) have two fluorescence peak (445 nm, 615 nm) and emits blue fluorescence. In order to
ain the widest and consecutive color evolution in the mixed system, the 7: 1 ratio for Si NCs and
Ds in fluorescent intensity is the best. In the sensory system (curve 3), the ratio of the
rescence intensity of Si CNs (445nm) and r-CDs (615 nm) was controlled in 7:1. Now, to make
reader more clearly, we have displayed the fluorescence spectrum of the Si CNs and r-CDs
in, please refer to Figure 1a in revised manuscript.
estion 2: The reviewer is interested in the fluorescence change with the probe and
hylmercury.
swer: We really appreciate your suggestion. The fluorescence changes with the probe and
hylmercury were investigated, the results are list below, it can be seen that the probe didn’t

con and carbon nanomaterials. The key innovation is the use of the carbon dots as an internal
dard. The fluorescence of the silicon and carbon dots causes a color change (rather than an
nsity change) that can be easily detected with the naked eye (albeit with a UV lamp to excite the
omaterials). I think this paper is quite interesting and potentially novel, but have some concerns
should be addressed prior to publication.
estion 1: The English needs work. There are numerous typographical and grammatical errors.
swer: We thank for the referee’s kindly reminding us of the grammar errors existed in the
nuscript and we have checked the style and presentation of language carefully and the inaccurate
mmar usage have been corrected in the revised manuscript. Also, the English language in the
ole manuscript has also been carefully edited in the revised manuscript.
estion 2: The organization of the results section makes the results difficult to interpret. The
res are not explained in detail and leave the reader to interpret too much information on their
n. In addition, the amount of results in the supplementary information is very high and makes the
er difficult to read.
swer: We really appreciate your kind suggestion. We have reorganized the result sections, and
figures were explained in detail, please refer to the results section and figures in revised
nuscript. In order to make the paper easy to read, some of the results in the supplementary
rmation were compressed, please refer to the results in Supporting Information.
estion 3: The introduction could use an additional paragraph that places this work in the context
other paper-based (or otherwise inexpensive) methods for Hg2+ determination. The authors
ntly mention anodic stripping voltammetry, which is widely used, is low cost, and typically able
e performed in situ.
swer: We really appreciate your kind suggestion. According to the referee’s suggestion, we have
ed other paper-based methods (or otherwise inexpensive) for Hg2+ determination, please refer
fourth paragraph in the revised manuscript, Page 1 “The materials of the assay of Hg2+
4
uded quantum dots (QDs) [12-14], fluorescent dyes derivatives [15], plasmonic metal
oparticles [16], upconversion nanoparticles [17], CDs [18,19] and Si NCs [20], exhibited good
ential in applied to detect Hg2+…...”. And the anodic stripping voltammetry was also mentioned
he revised manuscript. Please refer to second paragraph in the revised manuscript, Page 1
urrently, the widely used methods for the determination of mercuric ion include atomic
orption spectroscopy [4], inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy [5], X-ray fluorescence
ctrometry [6] and anodic stripping voltammetry [7]”.
estion 4: The data for NP size is inadequate. To simply say the NCs range in size from 3-5 nm is
remely sloppy. They have TEM data for the NPs, so they should generate the sizes from the data
ng a statistically relevant number of samples and plot that as a histogram. The size of the NPs
uld be reported with its uncertainty in the manuscript. The same argument is made for the carbon
s.
swer: We really appreciate your kind suggestion. We have generated the sizes from the data
ng a statistically relevant number of samples and plot that as histograms, and the size
ributions of SiCNs and r-CDs were added to the Figure 1, please refer to the Figure 1b and 1c
he revised manuscript.
estion 5: The authors do not describe how the size of the nanomaterials impacts the results. This
mportant in the context of batch-to-batch consistency. For instance, their Si NCs are listed as 3-5
, but how consistent is this synthesis? If there is a 20% size difference from batch to batch, what
l the expected changes in fluorescence intensity/emission wavelength be? This must be
cifically addressed in the manuscript and supported with evidence.
swer: Thanks for raising this point. In our experiment, the size of Si CNs can keep consistent by
trolling precisely the temperature and ratio of the starting material, and the size of the r-CDs
ntain consistent by purifying through a silica chromatography column. Generally, the assay
ults (fluorescence intensity) are related closely to the surface functional groups of the
oparticles, and the color changes (emission wavelength) are connection with the size of the
oparticles due to the quantum confinement effect which any dots size variation for a specific
rescence color (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014, 8, 4522). If there is a 20% size difference from batch
atch, the fluorescence emission wavelength of CDs is redshift (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2015, 54,
5
0).
estion 6: Fig 1. Why does the fluorescence signal at 445 nm increase when the C dots are
sent (compare curve 3 vs. curve 1)?
swer: Thanks for raising this point. Actually, when the C dots are present, the fluorescence
nal at 445 nm doesn’t increase. In Figure 1, curve 1 showed the fluorescence peak of Si CNs at
nm and emit blue fluorescence, curve 3 displayed the (Si CNs + r-CDs) have two fluorescence
k (445 nm, 615 nm) and emits blue fluorescence. In order to obtain the widest and consecutive
or evolution in the mixed system, the 7: 1 ratio for Si NCs and r-CDs in fluorescent intensity is
best. In the sensory system (curve 3), the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of Si CNs (445nm)
r-CDs (615 nm) was controlled in 7:1. Now, to make the reader more clearly, we have displayed
fluorescence spectrum of the Si CNs and r-CDs again, please refer to Figure 1a in revised
nuscript.
estion 7: Fig. 1 should include the TEM images for the C and Si nanomaterials.
swer: We really appreciate your kind suggestion. We have added the TEM images for the Si CNs
r-CDs in Figure 1, please refer to Figure 1b and 1c in revised manuscript.
estion 8: In the discussion of Fig.2, the sensitivity, intercept and correlation coefficient should
explicitly stated. These are tremendously important metrics for any analytical technique and a
sentation of a method without this information is sloppy.
swer: Thanks for raising this point. We have stated the sensitivity, intercept and correlation
fficient clearly: “A good linear relationship (I445/I615 = -0.011 × [Hg2+] + 0.840) with a
relation coefficient R2 of 0.995 for the concentration of Hg2+ ranging from 0 to 105 nM (Figure
), and the detection limit (sensitivity) was defined as 3 times of the standard deviation of
kground (3s), which was calculated to be 7.63 nM.” Please refer to the fourth paragraph on
e 3 in revised manuscript.
estion 9: Scheme 1. Is there any evidence to support the author claim that the nanocrystals
emble in this way? If the schematic is based on evidence, it should be shown; if the schematic is
ed on conjecture, it should be stated clearly in the figure caption.
swer: Thanks for raising this point. The schematic is based on conjecture, it have stated clearly
6
he figure caption: “Scheme illustration of the sensory system for the visualization assay of Hg2+
speculated. The blue fluorescence of Si NCs is quenched by Hg2+, while the red fluorescence of
Ds keep stable with the addition of Hg2+, resulting in the color evolution from blue to orange
.” Please refer to Scheme 1 in revised manuscript.
estion 10: Fig.3 is not presented well. What is the difference between selectivity and
rference? This should be clarified and presented in a way that is consistent with the analytical
mistry literature.
swer: Thanks for raising this point. The selectivity indicated that the sensor system is only
sitive to the Hg2+ over other metal ions; the interference demonstrated that the other ions existed
he sensor system didn’t interfere the assay of Hg2+. In order to make the paper clearly, we
sent the Figure 3 (selectivity and interference) into a new way, it is consistent with the analytical
mistry literature. Please refer to Figure 3 and Figure S13 in revised manuscript.
estion 11: Fig.3. What is the reason for the selectivity of Hg over the other ions? If the Hg
plex forms much more strongly with the amino groups, surely there should be some response
m the other species? Surely there is data to suggest that other metal species should form
plexes with the amino groups?
swer: Thanks for raising this point. From the Figure 3, it can be seen that the sensory system is
sitive to Hg2+ than other metal ions. According to the report of Yu et al. (Nanoscale, 2014, 6,
6), Hg2+ is known as a common fluorescence quencher due to the formation of nonradiative
ctron-transfer or energy-transfer. And the Si NCs modified with the amide groups to obtain the
ersensitivity to Hg2+ the quenching of blue fluorescence. It probably due to the interaction of Si
s with Hg2+ derived from amino groups on the surfaces of Si NCs via the affinity of Hg2+ to N,
affinity of amino group towards Hg2+ is larger than other ions. It will take further work to study
response mechanism of the sensory system with Hg2+. Moreover, the sensory system didn’t
ponse to other species, such as methylmercury, as shown in the following Figure.
