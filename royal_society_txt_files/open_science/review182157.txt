The response by Pierce accurately contextualixes the study by Knoll et al in relation to previous
work carried out in this area. His comments also critically interprets the validity of the Towler et
al response and by doing so creates a purposeful and highly useful discussion about what we can
and can't yet know about ovine cognition given the data generated from studies generated so far.

The author claims that his studies in collaboration with K. Kendrick had shown previously (1995-
2001) that face recognition in sheep is quite similar to that in humans, as Knolle et al. reported 15
years later.
I agree with the author that Kendrick’s’ lab was a pioneer and did an remarkable job in the study
of face recognition in sheep. However, as Towler et al. wrote in their comments, making claims
about the similarity of the mechanisms involved in face recognition needs to perform study using
an equivalent task between humans and sheep. This should be mentioned and Kendrick’s studies
did not used such a methodology. In addition, when one comment about the similarity of
mechanisms, what mechanism are we talking about? For instance, nothing is known about the
neurobiological mechanisms involved in face recognition. It could be possible that cognitive
performances are similar between sheep and humans but that face recognition involves similar or
different neuronal network is unknown. There is only one study from Kendrick’s lab showing
that cells of the temporal cortex code for individual recognition (1991).

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
5
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Rosalind Arden):
Thank you for revising the Commentary. It's clearly a topic that engages readers and experts.
This will make a very nice contribution to the discussion of sheep cognitive abilities with a focus
on face recognition. It was especially good of you to write and revise this Commentary, since
your suggestions first arose in the shape of a Review! Thank you for your work.

Thank you. I have worked to improve the manuscript a little further according to the
reviewers’ suggestions and in light of the full text of the Towler et al paper, now published.
At the point when I wrote the previous draft I had seen the first version of Towler et al but
not their final version, which was adapted according to reviewers’ comments (including my
own). As a result my text was, in places referring to comments they no longer make, and
did not include reference to comments that warranted reply.

The author claims that his studies in collaboration with K. Kendrick had
shown previously (1995-2001) that face recognition in sheep is quite
similar to that in humans, as Knolle et al. reported 15 years later.
I agree with the author that Kendrick’s’ lab was a pioneer and did an
remarkable job in the study of face recognition in sheep. However, as
Towler et al. wrote in their comments, making claims about the similarity
of the mechanisms involved in face recognition needs to perform study using
an equivalent task between humans and sheep. This should be mentioned and
Kendrick’s studies did not used such a methodology.
I have added text explaining this towards the end of this draft. The basic task we used (2-
alternative-forced-choice) and the stimulus manipulations, were very similar to many
previous human experiments.
That said, we (or at least I, maybe this isn’t true of my colleagues) never meant to claim
that sheep match human performance, nor even that the magnitude of, say, a face
inversion effect would be the same. I was interested merely in showing “do they show an
inversion effect”? Running participants on the same task was therefore not needed and it
probably would not have been informative if we had – the humans might well have been at
ceiling performance and then not shown an inversion effect on this task, for example. As I
had said before, there are many (entirely uninteresting) reasons for differences in
performance/magnitude of effects.
In addition, when one comment about the similarity of mechanisms, what
mechanism are we talking about? For instance, nothing is known about the
neurobiological mechanisms involved in face recognition. It could be
possible that cognitive performances are similar between sheep and humans
but that face recognition involves similar or different neuronal network is
unknown. There is only one study from Kendrick’s lab showing that cells of
the temporal cortex code for individual recognition (1991).
Agreed. This is also added explicitly into the discussion.
Please also clarify
- The last sentence on the first paragraph page 2: could you detailed
and give references?
In the statement, “the two effects have already been measured independently”? I was
meaning to summarise the text above but that clearly wasn’t obvious. I have reinserted
those references so as to be explicit.
- The issue raised on page 2 second paragraph: on which basis the
author claims that an image-matching algorithm cannot explained the
familiarity effect?
I hope I have better explained this. The social (3D) experience has altered the 2D
perception. The image matching algorithm is not capable of transferring across such
different arenas (even if it were capable of handing the 3D input which most image-
matching algorithms are not). Indeed, if our candidate image-match algorithm were able to
transfer recognition from a live encounter in the field to a flat projection in a lab, then we
would start to attribute genuine face recognition.
- The study showing that sheep recognize faces of unfamiliar animals
at different ages and in different orientations should be cited in the
comment (Transfer between views of conspecific faces at different ages or
in different orientations by sheep; Ferreira et al., 2004,
BEHAV.PROCESS,67, 491-499.)
That is an excellent point (I was sure there were other examples of transfer but had
forgotten this paper). It is included.
