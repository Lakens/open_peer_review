The authors present a study on patterns of association between known individual sperm whales
in Dominica, and compare this with kinship patterns inferred from genetic data. Crucially the
authors wanted to help determine the extent to which sperm whale groups are matrilineal. This is
an interesting topic and worth publishing, and I agree with the authors sentiment that although
sperm whales are normally described as matrilineal, there is not so much data supporting it and
is likely not entirely accurate. There are some limitations in terms of sample size and geographic
coverage, but it's not easy to obtain this data from sperm whales so sample sizes are never going
to be ideal. I think the data presented generally supports the idea that sperm whales are not
strictly matrilineal, but that juveniles accompanying their mothers are an important component
of observed social groups. However, I feel the authors focus too much on the drivers and
evolutionary aspect of the data to the detriment of exploring the range of possible matrilineal
societies, and how these can change even within species. In the discussion there is little
integration with studies on other cetacean species that also show matrilineality, and this would
be important at all levels of discussion. For example, the discussion about how the levels of
matrilineality change depending on region in sperm whales, there is no mention about this also
being seen in killer whales. Generally, I think the discussion needs to focus more on comparing
these patterns with those found in other cetacean groups, as opposed to the relatively long
3
discussion about evolutionary drivers, which is mostly speculative and generic, thus providing
little extra insight. Similarly, the Introduction should focus more on the idea of several levels of
matrilineality, rather than mentioning it only in the Methods. Therefore, I'm recommending the
paper be rejected at this stage, but encourage resubmission of a refocused version. I include
below some more specific comments.
Main comments:
I found the methods section about the social association aspect hard to follow at times. I
understand this is not the easiest topic to describe, but I found it hard to fully grasp what was
being considered as part of the same group. The terminology used also made it hard to
distinguish between the different types of groups defined. For example, the term "social unit"
although probably correct, makes it confusing when the terms "social group", "unit" and "group"
appear elsewhere in the paper (quite frequently as well). Please try and rephrase this section to
try and make the social analyses a bit clearer and easy to follow.
I also felt that some more detail about the different time gaps for defining groups is needed.
Considering animals seen in the same day as part of the same group seems slightly optimistic,
but accept that there might be good data to support this. So please do consider adding some
words to explain the strategic choices in this aspect of the study.
The number of tables is slightly excessive, with table 7 and 8 onlt being mentioned in the
discussion. Please consider whether all of these are required in the main text.
Pages 2-3, lines 54-4: as written, it is slightly difficult to understand the hierarchical structure.
Please try and rewrite to make it easier to understand by someone who isn't familiar with sperm
whale social structure.
Page 9, lines 25-32: from this description it appears that the results form the maternity inference
are not included in this, but I feel it should. Haplotype sharing does not necessarily mean
relatedness, particularly in a species with low mtDNA diversity.
Page 9, line 41: I think this is a good strategy, but feel it would be best if this distinction between
well/poorly sampled groups would be more useful earlier on in the methods regarding the
analyses. I found myself wondering about how many groups were fully sampled for all this data,
so mentioning the distinction earlier helps clear that early on.
Page 10, lines 5-20: this section should be present in the Introduction when this is first mentioned
Page 11, lines 31-34: this is fair enough and expected from sloughed skin samples, but authors
need to specify how were inconsistencies between the three reactions dealt with.
Page 12, lines 3-5: I can see why this was done, but there is a problem of circularity. If mtDNA
haplotype was used to confirm kinship inferred from other methods, then it's not really
appropriate to assume similar mtDNA based on other lines of evidence. In other words, mtDNA
should not be inferred and used as confirmatory evidence at the same time.
Page 13, lines 56-58: given that only two haplotypes were found, not sure this results mean much.
Please consider how these analyses can be affected by the low mtDNA diversity.
Page 14, lines 24-27: I would prefer if this was phrased as this study improving on the what has
been done in previous studies. Samples sizes are still not that great, and for some social units they
4
can be quite low. Also, please add citations of the "previous studies" to the end of the sentence.
Please consider revising.
Page 14, lines 55-57: Instead of the word "suggesting", write instead "raises the possibility" (or
something similar), as the evidence for this is quite circumstantial at this point.
Page 15, lines 3-20: I think the discussion of group merging needs to consider the various time
criteria used to accept individuals as part of the same group. Seeing two units in the same day
might does not necessarily mean they are associating.
Page 15, lines 22-24: this is only true if we assume that similarity in behaviour drives the high
association, but high association might actually be driving the behaviour similarity. Not saying
what is written is incorrect, only that it needs more information to be credible.
Page 16, Lines 25-38: I don't think this paragraph holds up particularly well, when the discussion
clearly stated before that kinship was not a driver of association. If the authors think the two
groups are similar, I suggest this is rephrased for clarity.
Page 17, lines 38-40: I think the main contribution of this paper is the idea that that there can be
different level of matrilineality. Sperm whales will show one of the levels, but clearly not the the
strict matrilineality that are found in other cetacean species
Minor comments:
Page 2, lines 34-35: I suggest the word theory is best avoided here. Best to use explanation or
hypothesis.
Page 2, line 41: same comment as above regarding the use of the word theory
Page 8, lines 45: please specify how inferred maternities that did not match the mtDNA were
handled.
Page 9, lines 6-10: unclear from the wording whether the known relationships were obtained
from field data, or from the software (it seems to be the former, but not sure). Please clarify.
Page 4, lines 12-15: I'm not entirely sure what this sentence is trying to convey. Please rewrite for
clarity.
Page 5, lines 39-43: Please only state the final number of microsatellites amplified (18 in this case).

consider rephrasing.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
This is a potentially important paper that uses an interesting dataset of observations and genetic
data to evaluate the (in some quarters) almost axiomatic but largely untested belief that sperm
6
whale social organization is strongly matrilineal. Both referees have raised numerous issues,
major and minor, that must be addressed in any revision.

I've read the resubmited version as well as the response to reviewers, and I'm happy to say that
the manuscript is now much improved, with a much tighter focus and more solid narrative. I feel
the authors addressed the reviewers comments well, providing adequate clarifications for those
recommendations tht were not necessarily directly followed reviewer suggestions. Box 1 is very
useful in clarifying terms, and I think the manuscript is now consistently clear in how the
different type of groups are presented and discussed. I make only some minor suggestions for
improvements, some of which are admitedly minor nitpicks. Generallly, I think the manuscript is
now acceptable for publication, and will be an important addition to the academic literature.
Congratulatins ot the authors for an interesting study, that I much enjoyed reading.
Final comments
I find it slightly odd that large sections of laboratory protocols have been moved to the
supplement. Generally, I think those were fine in the main text, and even preferably located
there. The information will still be available to readers though, so it might be ok as a supplement.
I think the discussion about the lack of association between social unit association and kinship
was interesting, and think the authors coould keep that in the final version.

eral comments
authors present very detailed analyses of kinship, as estimated from microsatellite genotypes
h mtDNA haplotypes and sex), and social units or social affiliations, as measured by photo-
tification in a long-term study of sperm whales near Dominica. Overall, I think the data and
lyses support the authors’ interpretations and conclusions for the hierarchical level of social
s as described but the complexity of some analyses obscures some of the more persuasive
lts. The manuscript is also very long, particularly the methods section. Most of these
hods are now well established (e.g., social affiliation indices, microsatellite genotyping) and
details could be moved to supplemental material.
nk the manuscript could be reduced in length and some of the Results could be better
strated by figures. For example,
erge and expand Figure 2 and 3 to include all 55 or 65 individuals with links of the estimated
hip (1st and 2nd degree) and a key to ‘dependent calves’. The figure could also include the
rage within and between kinship indices.

oduction
Introduction needs a brief but clear description of the ‘experimental design’, i.e., the
poral and spatial scale of the long-term study, with some background on the hierarchy of
al units in sperm whales (or this population of sperm whales). Presumably, much of this is
orted in Gero et al. (2014) and some details are provided in the Methods but the general
er will ask, why is this an appropriate population to address the question of associations and
hip? The reader also need some background on the life history of sperm whales. What is a
pendent calf’ and at what age is an individual considered to be a juvenile or an adult? That
ors mention that a calf is still nursing but how is that determined and at what age are they
ned? How many generations could plausibly be represented in a strictly matrilineal social
(by the authors definition) given life history parameters? Presumably, there is some insight
age structure of groups from the whaling literature.
hods and Results

ted, i.e., how many records were used to derive the association indices? Was there a
imum number of sightings required for calculating the HWI?
main uncertain about how the Social Units (referred by letters) were defined and how they
te to the 3 definitions of associations (pg 4, ln 23). Were the different Social Units ever
ted within a day? If so, were they included in the associations at this level? Did this result in
misclassification of Social Units in some of the observations, i.e., individuals sighted in the
e day were considered associated but were really members of different Social Units?
population represented by the Social Units was small (98 individuals, presumably including
niles and dependent calves) and only about half (55) have an associated DNA profile linked
he photo-identification. This limits the potential to genetically ‘capture’ individuals that could
inked by direct matrilineal relationships, e.g., a grandmother could be alive but unsampled in
R. This should be considered in the Discussion (pg 14, ln 30). The relatively small sample
could also influence the precision of estimates of kinship and limit the power of exclusion in
tests for maternity and paternity, as these are dependent on the underlying allele frequencies
population. The authors mention the probability of identity and the probability of siblings in
Methods but do not report these values in the results. Similarly, it is typical to report the
bability of exclusion or an LOD score for maternity or paternity.

cific comments
tract
e 16-19: Unclear if this association is within or between social units (I assume within, given
title of the manuscript)
e 18-19: This seems like a pretty big exception. Surely this suggests that kinship could be
uencing relationships between social units. Did any other units merge over the study period?
oduction
e 2: Line 42-45: Earlier in this paragraph the authors elaborated on kin-selection and
procal altruism. The same slightly more detailed explanation would be useful for byproduct
efits and group augmentation.
e 57: Suggest specifically mentioning these are ‘vocal’ or ‘acoustic’ clans to highlight how
s likely identify other units from the same clan (especially given this is a general journal that
s less familiar with general sperm whale biology are likely to be reading).
e 3: Line 7-8: Suggest elaborating on this – I think the lack of explicit examination of this is
ely due to the difficulty of behavioural studies on sperm whales and how long lived they are,
er than a lack of interest in these questions.
e 10-11: Need some references to back up the “often described” statement.
es 20-22: This is a bit of a strawman: matrilineal has a generally accepted definition
ps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrilineality), so why should the authors of those previous papers
vide an explicit definition themselves? Do the units consist of solely maternally related kin as
gested by identical mtDNA haplotypes? If yes, they could be matrilineal (but potentially not
n the low mtDNA diversity of sperm whales). If not, they are definitely not “strictly
rilineal”. I think this comment could be replaced by a segue to the next sentence along the
owing: “Regardless of whether social units are strictly matrilineal, if kin selection etc.”
e 23-24: Think you need to explicitly contrast this with the previous sentence, because this is
t unexpected given that assertion e.g. “However, in the few cases etc.”. Also, I think the
ors might need to be more specific in the “results have been mixed” category. Gero et al.
wed pretty compelling evidence (I thought) for associations that correlated with relatedness.
at stands your study apart/how does it build on these studies? By looking across social units
ell as within them? This needs to be more strongly introduced at the top of page 3 if so (e.g.
currently unclear what influences units to associate with another unit other than clan
mbership, potentially relatedness etc.”
e 26: Suggest removing “explicitly define multiple possible levels of matrilineality” for same
on as my comments on Lines 20-22, and focus instead on how relatedness influences within
between unit associations.
hods
e 3:Lines 48, 56: Check reference format.
e 4:Line 3-5: Just as an FYI, our lab has found samples more stable for long-term storage in
nol than in salt DMSO.
e 9: Check reference format.
e 12, 19: Suggest giving the actual number of identifications out of the total, rather than %.
e 24: Remove “in” from end of line
e 34: Suggest adding (see definition below) following association index, because you have
defined that yet.
es 36-37, 40, 55: Check reference format.
e 38: Vague – what do you mean by autocorrelation in cluster composition? It seems from the
t sentence that you could expect autocorrelation across sequential days, so how does this tie
ith the two hour interval used here?
e 45-47: Awkward sentence
e 5:Line 14-21: This is a pretty cool approach for getting around quality issues from the
ghed skin samples. Check to make sure REs and gene names are italicized.
es 27-31: I think this sentence should start the paragraph, because it provides justification for
you might need an additional layer of quality control with these kinds of samples.
e 31-33: This is a little vague. Do you mean you increased the amount of DNA from sloughed
samples in proportion to how much weaker the ZFX/ZFY band was in comparison to the
obtained from the biopsy sample?
e 52-54: Suggest including the fluorescent dye label in Table S2 because this can influence
apparent allele size.
e 48-49: Suggest clarifying that “functional concentration” was assessed relative to the
X/ZFY band brightness.
e 6: Line 24-25: What do you mean “blind control”? It is unclear how this is blind if you
cted the samples. If it was just a replicate sample for the purposes of genotyping error
mation, then potentially call it that rather than blind control.
e27-28: check reference format.
es 20-38: Again, I think this is an elegant way for getting around quality issues from sloughed
samples.
e 39-41: With the exception of the Mediterranean.
e 7: Line 32-33: Again, I’m taking issue with the term “blind” – this is only appropriate if the
ple identity of those replicates was unknown by the specific researcher undertaking the
uencing work. Otherwise you are running duplicates to check the consistency of haplotype
uencing (which is a completely fine way to do it – it doesn’t need to be blind).
es 44-45: Check reference format.
e 8: Line 11-12: What was the sex of your “non-member” genetic-only (unidentified)
viduals? Could these potentially be males temporarily consorting with your social units? Did
genotype of these “non-member” individuals appear related to any other individuals in your
y?
e 18-19, 41-42: Check reference format.
es 35-36: This wording seems slightly awkward – do you mean increasing your chances of
ing the global optimum of the likelihood surface?
e 9: Lines 6-13: This is a cool way to select among the different relatedness estimators.
e 36-37: check reference format
e 10: Lines 3-21: If you think of ‘matrilineality’ as ‘maternal monophyly’ then your
nerally matrilineal’ units are matrilineal in that they include all surviving descendants of the
CA of that node (even if the matriarch has died). Therefore, I don’t think that defining
ctly matrilineal’ as requiring a split upon the death of a matriarch is a very compelling
ument, nor a super important distinction to make for the author’s ‘levels’ (I’m prepared to
nge my mind if the authors present some definitions of matrilineality from the literature based
his).
o suggest avoiding the use of the term ‘levels’ – to me, this brings to mind Whitehead et al.
12) and the multilevel societies (i.e. different ‘levels’ of matrilineality as you go further “up”
hierarchy of social structure ‘levels’)
nk this is probably more detail than needed and could be considerably simplified to
ething along the lines of “we evaluated whether social units appeared to have more than one
riline present (as assessed using maternally-inherited mtDNA haplotypes as a proxy for
ernal relationships). I would leave interpretation of “matrilineally-based” (but not matrilineal
he strictest sense) to the discussion if this is indeed detected among any of your social units.
e 33-34: Expand on what you mean by “social modularity”
e 51-54: What about also assessing this based on “maximum” relatedness of any between-
pairwise relatedness values (e.g. what if one “key” between-unit pair was responsible for
sing the association between units, rather than just average unit-unit relationship values)?
ults
e 11: Line 10-12: Clarify whether the failures were sloughed skin or biopsy samples (or
h).
e 20-23: This seems to be a pretty decent error rate in line with other sperm whale papers that
e reported error rates (e.g. Alexander et al. 2016). Might be worth giving that context for your
s.
e 38-42: Good point.
e 43-46: I still think these individuals could be of interest in a paternity analysis, and would
nterested in whether they are related to any other individuals in your dataset. I understand
luding them – it is difficult to look at social associations if you do not know which whale you
e sampled genetically, and/or it never appears with any other whale in the dataset again, but it
ld be good to confirm they are just ‘transient’ individuals (or not!), rather than shy whales
are actually in your social units but just very rarely photographed.
e 48-49: I don’t know if Table 1 is the best figure to refer to here, as it doesn’t really show
vidual based analyses. Would suggest referring to sup mat 3 instead (which, by the way,
k you for including – not enough folks make their individual-level data available).
es 55: See previous comments on the use of “blind”
e 12: Line 12-13: Suggest making the language a little stronger: “multiple mitochondrial
lotypes were not observed within individual social units – which would be evidence that units
e not matrilineal – though each haplotype etc.”
e 18-19: Based on observation history?
e 18-29: This dataset could be used for looking at variance in female reproductive success –
ld tie in nicely with Whitehead’s cultural hitchhiking hypothesis.
e 41-43: Were these potential full sibling relationships within or between social units?
e 13: Lines 54-58: Social modularity still needs more explanation, especially how it relates to
overall aims of this paper.
e 14: Line 9: Suggest using the word “differing” rather than “opposing”
e 11-12: This is the first time in this paper I’ve really understood the relationship between
s and clusters. It might be worth doing a little schematic figure to show folks what you mean
hese things (e.g. a group is multiple units, which you might pick up by a “cluster” of units, or
uster might just be the observation of a unit or part of a unit on its own). I’m still a little
lear on how all of this relates to association measure (day, 2 hours, cluster), and sampling
rval (year, 10 day, six hours), and I think this could be clarified by a schematic figure.
es 15-21: Is there any chance that U and F actually are actually one social unit that has been
classified?
e 49-57: This goes to my question earlier – is it possible they were not perceived as a single
al unit back in 1995 by mistake?
cussion
e 14: Line 34-36: Alternately, the decrease in adults may “hold” together units that would
rwise split because they have got too large.

Appendix B
Dear Dr Phillip Clapham and Dr Kevin Padian,
We appreciate the reviewers’ and editor’s positive general comments on this paper
(originally submitted in 2017, as #RSOS-171251) and on our analysis using of a
comprehensive dataset of genetics and social observations to examine questions of
maternal relatedness in sperm whale society. We gladly agree with Reviewer 2’s
comment that the paper is on “an interesting topic and worth publishing”.
We are grateful for these constructive and helpful reviews that have provided
enlightening suggestions on how to refine, reframe and better present the results of
this paper. We also appreciated that the reviewers identified areas where
clarification of certain technical points was needed. Below we address the
reviewers’ major and minor comments on the original manuscript. For two areas
that raised several comments from the reviewers (1. matrilineality, and 2. sperm
whale social organization) we have written general responses that outline how we
addressed these two issues.
We hope that you will find that these revisions are to your satisfaction and that the
revised manuscript would be a valuable addition to Royal Society Open Science.
Sincerely,
Christine Konrad, MSc
Whitehead Lab, Biology Dept., Dalhousie University
General response to comments on matrilineality
Reviewer 1 made comments questioning the usefulness of our focus on definitions
of matrilineal, while Reviewer 2 suggested that the “the main contribution of this
paper is the idea that that there can be different levels of matrilineality”. We felt
these discrepant comments warranted an overall response. We agree that the
Reviewer 1 makes a fair point in highlighting that matrilineal has a generally
accepted definition, and we ought not to claim new definitions for matrilineal as if
to replace the established one. However, the definition of materiality that Reviewer
1 provided a link to (“Matrilineality is the tracing of descent through the female
line” - wikipedia.ca) is quite broad. In line with the comments of Reviewer 2, we
believe that viewing matrilineality in solely general and dichotomous terms limits
the ability of researchers to describe maternal kinship in social groups, and we
would argue that being more specific allows for more specific hypotheses, and social
systems, to be teased apart. With this in mind, we have preserved our uses of
multiple degrees of matrilineality, but we have been careful to restructure our
writing to present them as sub-categories of differing degrees of matrilineality,
rather than reinventions of a well-established term. There were also differing
perspectives between the reviewers of where our idea of categories of matrilineality
should be introduced; we have taken the perspective of Reviewer 2 and moved
some of this content to the Introduction, but we reframed it in a way to take the
critiques of Reviewer 1 into account.
General response to comments on sperm whale social organization
An area of confusion mentioned by both reviewers was in following the various
definitions of levels of social structure and degrees of association. To address this,
we have revised the manuscript to ensure consistency in the terms used (i.e. using
‘social unit’ exclusively, rather than interchangeably with ‘unit’), added a definitions
box (Box 1) to make key terms easy to reference, and re-worded the appropriate
sections.
Authors’ response to reviewer comments:
Reviewer 1:
General comments
The authors present very detailed analyses of kinship, as estimated from
microsatellite genotypes (with mtDNA haplotypes and sex), and social units or social
affiliations, as measured by photoidentification in a long-term study of sperm
whales near Dominica. Overall, I think the data and analyses support the authors’
interpretations and conclusions for the hierarchical level of social units as described
but the complexity of some analyses obscures some of the more persuasive results.
The manuscript is also very long, particularly the methods section. Most of these
methods are now well established (e.g., social affiliation indices, microsatellite
genotyping) and the details could be moved to supplemental material. I think the
manuscript could be reduced in length and some of the Results could be better
illustrated by figures.
We have moved the majority of the details on microsatellite genotyping and
mtDNA sequencing to the supplemental material, as well as some details on
social affiliation indices. We also merged Tables 1 and 3, and we moved
Tables 7 and 8 to the supplemental material and reduced the length of the
discussion, by refocusing it in a way suggested by Reviewer 2.
For example:
- Merge and expand Figure 2 and 3 to include all 55 or 65 individuals with links of
the estimated kinship (1st and 2nd degree) and a key to ‘dependent calves’. The
figure could also include the average within and between kinship indices.
We acknowledge that in deciding between presenting this information in one
versus two figures there is a trade-off between brevity and clarity; combining
the figures would certainly be more concise, but we feel it would come with a
reduction in clarity. Thus, in this case we chose to favour clarity (i.e. the
current arrangement), but, at the editors’ request, would reconstitute these
figures as suggested.
- Merge the information from Table 3 with SupMat Figure 1 and move this into the
primary text for publication.
We are unclear on how the material from Table 3 and Figure S1 could be
merged, so we assume that perhaps the reviewer meant Table 4 and Figure
S1. However, we feel that moving Figure S1 to the primary text would increase
the length of the primary text, which is counter to the goal mentioned by the
reviewer above to reduce the manuscript in length.
Introduction
The Introduction needs a brief but clear description of the ‘experimental design’,
i.e., the temporal and spatial scale of the long-term study, with some background on
the hierarchy of social units in sperm whales (or this population of sperm whales).
Presumably, much of this is reported in Gero et al. (2014) and some details are
provided in the Methods but the general reader will ask, why is this an appropriate
population to address the question of associations and kinship?
We have added additional details on the study to the last paragraph of the
introduction, as well additional context in the paragraph before to clarify why
this is an appropriate population to address the question of associations and
kinship.
The reader also need some background on the life history of sperm whales. What is
a ‘dependent calf’ and at what age is an individual considered to be a juvenile or an
adult? That authors mention that a calf is still nursing but how is that determined
and at what age are they weaned? How many generations could plausibly be
represented in a strictly matrilineal social unit (by the authors definition) given life
history parameters? Presumably, there is some insight into age structure of groups
from the whaling literature.
As Reviewer 1 correctly presumed, much of this background information (e.g.
how age classes were defined) is reported in Gero et al. (2014). As such, we
have referred to this paper in our methods and do not feel it needs all be
reiterated here. However, we have added a reference to a paper that
describes nursing behaviour (Gero et al 2007), and a comment on the number
of generations to be expected in a strict matriline to the relevant section in the
methods.
Methods and Results
Although photo-identification and association indices are primary input for these
analyses, there is little information on the density of these data. How often were
individuals and social units sighted, i.e., how many records were used to derive the
association indices? Was there a minimum number of sightings required for
calculating the HWI?
Some of these details have been added to the results and the additional
details were added to the electronic supplementary material (Figure S3).
I remain uncertain about how the Social Units (referred by letters) were defined and
how they relate to the 3 definitions of associations (pg 4, ln 23). Were the different
Social Units ever sighted within a day? If so, were they included in the associations
at this level? Did this result in the misclassification of Social Units in some of the
observations, i.e., individuals sighted in the same day were considered associated
but were really members of different Social Units?
We have added ‘Box 1’ to clarify these definitions and their relationship to one
another. This should help address these questions, but to also answer them
specifically: Yes, different Social Units were sometimes sighted within a day,
and were included in the associations at this level (e.g., in Tables 2 and 6).
However, Social Unit membership is assigned based on repeated association
of individuals at a finer resolution than being identified in the same day
(rather: to be assigned to the same social unit individuals must be identified
within two hours of each other in at least two different years). Thus, this
would not result in the misclassification of Social Units.
The population represented by the Social Units was small (98 individuals,
presumably including juveniles and dependent calves) and only about half (55) have
an associated DNA profile linked to the photo-identification. This limits the potential
to genetically ‘capture’ individuals that could be linked by direct matrilineal
relationships, e.g., a grandmother could be alive but unsampled in unit R. This
should be considered in the Discussion (pg 14, ln 30).
We readily agree that in social units that were not well-sampled genetically,
living relatives could be missing from our analysis and thus impacting the
genetic network within of social units. This was the primary reason that we
restricted our analysis of relationships within units to six well-sampled social
units. These six social units are well known from our longitudinal study of
social associations (making it unlikely that there were unknown and
unidentified living social unit members) and all adult female unit members
were genetically sampled. Thus, we do not believe any grandmothers (or other
adult female relatives) still living in these social units were missing from our
analysis of these units.
To clarify this to readers in our discussion, we have added the phrase “despite
all adult female members of these social units being genetically sampled.”
The relatively small sample size could also influence the precision of estimates of
kinship and limit the power of exclusion in the tests for maternity and paternity, as
these are dependent on the underlying allele frequencies of a population.
For estimating allele frequencies, we do not think that 98 individuals is a
“small” sample size. This is primarily for two reasons. First, Nei (1987) has
shown that estimates of variation become essentially unbiased at sample sizes
> 50. Second, previous work (Lyrholm et al. 1999) has shown a lack of nuclear
structure in sperm whales throughout the world, suggesting that our
estimates are not biased by patterns of local structure.

dispersal in sperm whales: contrasting mitochondrial and nuclear genetic
structure of global populations. Proc. R. Soc. B Biol. Sci. 266, 347–354.
The authors mention the probability of identity and the probability of siblings in the
Methods but do not report these values in the results. Similarly, it is typical to
report the probability of exclusion or an LOD score for maternity or paternity. Waits,
L.P., G. Luikart and P. Taberlet. 2001. Estimating the probability of identity among
genotypes in natural populations: cautions and guidelines. Molecular Ecology
10:249-256.
The probability of identity and the probability of siblings mentioned in the
methods were pairwise for 31 pairs of samples. Rather than reporting these
individual values, we reported our rules for assigning sample pairs as the same
or as different individuals (if log10(PInd / PSib) > 3, or log10(PSib / PInd) > 3,
respectively) and the outcome of applying these rules (“After consolidating
duplicates and excluding three likely duplicate samples that did not meet the
log-likelihood ratio criteria, 95 unique individuals remained”). We have added
the phrase “as determined by log10(PInd / PSib) values)” to this sentence, to
make the connection to the method clearer.
Additionally, based on this suggestion, we have now also calculated and
reported a POI and POI-sib value for an entire data set.
The reason we did not report the probability of exclusion or LOD scores was
that Colony 2.0.6.2 – the software used to assign maternity – does not do this
when using the full-maximum likelihood method that we used in this study.
The choice of inclusion or exclusion of ‘dependent calves’ need clarification. How
can it be informative to include a ‘dependent calves’ in any analysis of social
affiliations and kinship (pg 13, ln 3)?
We originally chose to include dependant calves’ interactions with their
mothers because dependant calves are still valid unit members and their
interactions could still be considered part of the patterns of kinship and
association as a whole. However, we acknowledge that positive association
between dependant calves and their mothers is to be expected and likely
distracts from the patterns of interest more than it adds to them. Thus, we
have removed the analyses that included dependant calves’ interactions with
their mothers from our manuscript.
However, the confirmation of the maternity of dependent calves is of interest and
offers an opportunity to document the persistence of affiliations between a mother
and her juvenile or mature offspring. Was it possible document the change in
affiliations from dependent calf to mature offspring for any parent offspring pair?
A previous study has demonstrated a strong bond between a male offspring
and his mother, beyond dependence, until the mother had a new calf (Gero et
al. 2013, Figure 4). This would be an interesting question to examine further in
a different unpublished manuscript we have underway that focuses on the calf
care and genetic relatedness.

Discussion
Tables 6 and 7 are not cited until the Discussion. These would seem more
appropriately moved to the Results with new subheaders.
We assume that the reviewer means Tables 7 and 8. We have moved these
tables to the ESM as was suggested by the other reviewer.
The data and analyses do not really provide any evidence of cultural units or clans.
This may be true, and supported by other evidence presented elsewhere, but I think
the inference here should be limited to the hierarchical limits of the social units, as
described.
Inference about clans and culture omitted from the revision.
The authors comment on the previously proposed parallel (or convergence) of
matrilineal social organisation in sperm whales and African elephants but not with
other cetaceans. What about killer whales or pilot whales?
We have added discussion of matrilineal social organisation in killer whales.
Data from long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas) suggests that this
species also lives in matrilineal groups, without male dispersal, but we felt not
enough detail is known to meaningfully compare the strictness and variability
of matrilineality in their society.
Specific comments
Abstract
Line 16-19: Unclear if this association is within or between social units (I assume
within, given the title of the manuscript)
This statement refers to the results in Table 2, which were across all
individuals (both within and between social units), but the significant
correlation appears to be driven by associations within social units. We have
added “Generally and within social units,…”
Line 18-19: This seems like a pretty big exception. Surely this suggests that kinship
could be influencing relationships between social units. Did any other units merge
over the study period?
No other unit mergers were observed in this study, but some other social units
spent notable amounts of time with each other. So, these social units are
indeed, a note-worthy exception, which is why we mentioned the exception in
our abstract. Additionally, in our discussion we acknowledged that our data
suggests “that mergers may be driven by kinship”. We have also added the
word “generally” to the manuscript’s title.
Introduction
Page 2: Line 42-45: Earlier in this paragraph the authors elaborated on kin-selection
and reciprocal altruism. The same slightly more detailed explanation would be
useful for byproduct benefits and group augmentation.
More explanation provided.
Line 57: Suggest specifically mentioning these are ‘vocal’ or ‘acoustic’ clans to
highlight how units likely identify other units from the same clan (especially given
this is a general journal that folks less familiar with general sperm whale biology are
likely to be reading).
Phrase added specifying that these clans have distinguishable vocal
repertoires.
Page 3: Line 7-8: Suggest elaborating on this – I think the lack of explicit examination
of this is largely due to the difficulty of behavioural studies on sperm whales and
how long lived they are, rather than a lack of interest in these questions.
Elaborated on.
Line 10-11: Need some references to back up the “often described” statement.
Added.
Lines 20-22: This is a bit of a strawman: matrilineal has a generally accepted
definition (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrilineality), so why should the authors
of those previous papers provide an explicit definition themselves? Do the units
consist of solely maternally related kin as suggested by identical mtDNA haplotypes?
If yes, they could be matrilineal (but potentially not given the low mtDNA diversity
of sperm whales). If not, they are definitely not “strictly matrilineal”. I think this
comment could be replaced by a segue to the next sentence along the following:
“Regardless of whether social units are strictly matrilineal, if kin selection etc.”
See ‘General response to comments on matrilineality’. Also note, we have
rephrased here to avoid setting up a strawman, but to focus on what can be
added by examining the degree to which social units are composed of
maternal relatives (even if not exclusively so).
Line 23-24: Think you need to explicitly contrast this with the previous sentence,
because this is a bit unexpected given that assertion e.g. “However, in the few cases
etc.”. Also, I think the authors might need to be more specific in the “results have
been mixed” category. Gero et al. showed pretty compelling evidence (I thought) for
associations that correlated with relatedness. What stands your study apart/how
does it build on these studies? By looking across social units as well as within them?
This needs to be more strongly introduced at the top of page 3 if so (e.g. it is
currently unclear what influences units to associate with another unit other than
clan membership, potentially relatedness etc.”
“However” added.
We have added more detail in this paragraph and explained how our study is
set apart from past work.
Line 26: Suggest removing “explicitly define multiple possible levels of
matrilineality” for same reason as my comments on Lines 20-22, and focus instead
on how relatedness influences within and between unit associations.
See ‘General response to comments on matrilineality’. Also, we have
rephrased our ‘definitions’ as “categories along a gradient of matrilineality”

Sentence moved to the start of the paragraph.
Line 31-33: This is a little vague. Do you mean you increased the amount of DNA
from sloughed skin samples in proportion to how much weaker the ZFX/ZFY band
was in comparison to the one obtained from the biopsy sample?
Yes, this is what we mean. We have added an example to clarify this.

Clarified.
Page 6: Line 24-25: What do you mean “blind control”? It is unclear how this is blind
if you selected the samples. If it was just a replicate sample for the purposes of
genotyping error estimation, then potentially call it that rather than blind control.
We do indeed mean blind control. For these seven samples, C.K. (who carried
out the lab work and manually confirmed all allele calls) while aware of which
seven samples were being replicated, was blinded with regard to the specific
identities of which sample was which. We did so to establish the reliability and
replicability of the genotyping, while eliminating the possibility that allele calls
for replicates would be unintentionally biased towards conformity with each
other based on prior knowledge of what the allele was assigned as in other
replicates. We have expanded the relevant sentence in the manuscript to
clarify this.
Line27-28: check reference format.
Corrected.
Lines 20-38: Again, I think this is an elegant way for getting around quality issues
from sloughed skin samples.
Thank you, we agree!
Line 39-41: With the exception of the Mediterranean.
This is true, though we had decided not to include mention of this since the
Mediterranean is not always strictly considered part of the North Atlantic,
and it was not relevant to the question at hand of estimating allele
frequencies off Dominica.
Page 7: Line 32-33: Again, I’m taking issue with the term “blind” – this is only
appropriate if the sample identity of those replicates was unknown by the specific
researcher undertaking the sequencing work. Otherwise you are running duplicates
to check the consistency of haplotype sequencing (which is a completely fine way to
do it – it doesn’t need to be blind).

(unidentified) individuals? Could these potentially be males temporarily consorting
with your social units? Did the genotype of these “non-member” individuals appear
related to any other individuals in your study?
These individuals included both males and females. We agree that the
identities of these individuals are of interest, in particular their genetic
relationships (or lack thereof) to individuals in known units. We are in the
process of examining this, but it was beyond the scope of the present
manuscript, which we designed to focus on members of known social units.

Page 10: Lines 3-21: If you think of ‘matrilineality’ as ‘maternal monophyly’ then
your ‘generally matrilineal’ units are matrilineal in that they include all surviving
descendants of the MRCA of that node (even if the matriarch has died). Therefore, I
don’t think that defining ‘strictly matrilineal’ as requiring a split upon the death of a
matriarch is a very compelling argument, nor a super important distinction to make
for the author’s ‘levels’ (I’m prepared to change my mind if the authors present
some definitions of matrilineality from the literature based on this). I also suggest
avoiding the use of the term ‘levels’ – to me, this brings to mind Whitehead et al.
(2012) and the multilevel societies (i.e. different ‘levels’ of matrilineality as you go
further “up” the hierarchy of social structure ‘levels’). I think this is probably more
detail than needed and could be considerably simplified to something along the
lines of “we evaluated whether social units appeared to have more than one
matriline present (as assessed using maternally-inherited mtDNA haplotypes as a
proxy for maternal relationships). I would leave interpretation of “matrilineally-
based” (but not matrilineal in the strictest sense) to the discussion if this is indeed
detected among any of your social units.
See ‘General response to comments on matrilineality’.
To specifically address the concern that “generally matrilineal units are
matrilineal in that they include all surviving descendants of the MRCA of that
node (even if the matriarch has died)” and thus that “defining ‘strictly
matrilineal’ as requiring a split upon the death of a matriarch [isn’t] a super
important distinction”: we agree that this definition draws a line in the sand
that may or may not be biologically important to the whales. However, we
suspect it is likely biologically relevant to the whales whether (a) the MCRA is
alive compared to (b) that ancestor being many generations removed from all
living individuals. We cannot be sure where the degree of separation begins to
be an important distinction biologically, however, we believe setting up
categories to evaluate different scenarios will help address this question.
Also, we have rephrased to use the terms ‘degrees’ and ‘categories’ instead of
‘levels’ and ‘definitions’.
Line 33-34: Expand on what you mean by “social modularity”
Definition of social modules added.
Line 51-54: What about also assessing this based on “maximum” relatedness of any
between unit pairwise relatedness values (e.g. what if one “key” between-unit pair
was responsible for causing the association between units, rather than just average
unit-unit relationship values)?
We did originally consider examining the maximum pairwise relatedness value
between units, but we decided against it because of the potential for it to be
strongly affected by paternal relatedness across units, or occasional transfers
of individuals between social units. Thus, we used average relatedness as our
measure of recent common maternal ancestry. We have added the phrase “as
our measure of recent common maternal ancestry” here to increase clarity.
Results
Page 11: Line 10-12: Clarify whether the failures were sloughed skin or biopsy
samples (or both).
Clarified.
Line 20-23: This seems to be a pretty decent error rate in line with other sperm
whale papers that have reported error rates (e.g. Alexander et al. 2016). Might be
worth giving that context for your rates.
Content added for comparison.
Line 38-42: Good point.
Line 43-46: I still think these individuals could be of interest in a paternity analysis,
and would be interested in whether they are related to any other individuals in your
dataset. I understand excluding them – it is difficult to look at social associations if
you do not know which whale you have sampled genetically, and/or it never
appears with any other whale in the dataset again, but it would be good to confirm
they are just ‘transient’ individuals (or not!), rather than shy whales that are actually
in your social units but just very rarely photographed.
We very much agree that these individuals would be of interest in a paternity
analysis, and we plan to examine these individuals in detail in a subsequent
publication specifically addressing paternity. Also, we also know these units
very well (see Gero et al, 2014), and so we are quite confident that these
individuals are not members of the social units in this analysis. We
acknowledge that these individuals would be of interest for addressing
population level questions about genetics, but they were not useful to the
analysis of fine-scale social structure.

Dominica, West Indies. Mar. Mammal Sci. 30, 905–922.
Line 48-49: I don’t know if Table 1 is the best figure to refer to here, as it doesn’t
really show individual based analyses. Would suggest referring to sup mat 3 instead
(which, by the way, thank you for including – not enough folks make their individual-
level data available).
We referred to Table 1 here to highlight that these social units were selected
because they were well-sampled genetically. Also, now that we have merged
Tables 1 and 3 this table includes some of the results of our within-unit
analysis. Thus, we have left this Table reference as is.
Lines 55: See previous comments on the use of “blind”
See previous reply about blind samples.
Page 12: Line 12-13: Suggest making the language a little stronger: “multiple
mitochondrial haplotypes were not observed within individual social units – which
would be evidence that units were not matrilineal – though each haplotype etc.”
Rephrased to “Mitochondrial haplotypes were consistent within social units
(which is a requisite result for the social units to be considered matrilineal)”.
Line 18-19: Based on observation history?
Correct. The methods for assigning individuals as adult females and offspring
were described on page 8, in the sections on age class and on assigning
maternity and determining likely genetic relationships.
Line 18-29: This dataset could be used for looking at variance in female reproductive
success – could tie in nicely with Whitehead’s cultural hitchhiking hypothesis.
That is an interesting suggestion! However, we feel it is beyond the scope of
this paper.
Line 41-43: Were these potential full sibling relationships within or between social
units?
These potential full sibling relationships were both between social units,
though in one case the individuals had different mtDNA haplotypes, excluding
the possibility that they were true full siblings. Added “inter-social unit”
Page 13: Lines 54-58: Social modularity still needs more explanation, especially how
it relates to the overall aims of this paper.
Rephrased to improve clarity.
Page 14: Line 9: Suggest using the word “differing” rather than “opposing”
We have revised accordingly.
Line 11-12: This is the first time in this paper I’ve really understood the relationship
between units and clusters. It might be worth doing a little schematic figure to show
folks what you mean by these things (e.g. a group is multiple units, which you might
pick up by a “cluster” of units, or a cluster might just be the observation of a unit or
part of a unit on its own). I’m still a little unclear on how all of this relates to
association measure (day, 2 hours, cluster), and sampling interval (year, 10 day, six
hours), and I think this could be clarified by a schematic figure.
Box 1 added to highlight and clarify definitions. Also, see overall comment at
start of our reply.
Lines 15-21: Is there any chance that U and F actually are actually one social unit
that has been misclassified?
Unit F is the best-known sperm whale social unit in our study (and arguably in
the world), with 117 days of observation since 2005 (Table 7 – now Table S4).
Unit U had also been observed extensively, with 49 days of observation in the
same time period (Table 7). In 2005-2007, Units F and U were never seen
together, despite Unit F being observed on 56 days (Table 7). To us, this is
quite robust evidence that these units were not ‘constant companions’ which
is what our definition of social unit aims to capture. Observations of these
units also pre-date the Dominica Sperm Whale Project, dating back to the
1990s. In these earlier years, Units F and U were seen together on occasion,
but did not meet our definition to be a single social unit, and instead were
considered to be a bond-pair (Gero et al. 2015).

long-term social fidelity between social units of sperm whales. Anim. Behav.

as a single social unit back in 1995 by mistake?
See above.
Discussion
Page 14: Line 34-36: Alternately, the decrease in adults may “hold” together units
that would otherwise split because they have got too large.
This is an excellent point. We have added a sentence to address it later in the
discussion, where we discuss how social structure may be affected by the
critical decline in this population.
Line 41-47: I’d shift some of the discussion from Page 10 about matrilineality here.
See ‘General response to comments on matrilineality’.
Page 17: Line 20: Evolution not evolutions.
Typo corrected.
Table and Figures:
I wonder if Table 1 and Table 3 should be combined: both are presenting unit-level
information.
Tables combined.
Figure 2 legend: add whether light shading or dark shading is equivalent to
haplotype A or haplotype BB.
Added.
Figure 2 is presented before Figure 1 in the text.
Figures renamed accordingly.
Figure 2 shows * as ‘no missing members’ but Table 1 shows * as well sampled. Unit
R for example, is well sampled but missing some members.
Part of the definition of ‘well-sampled’ is that the genetic profiles of the unit
are missing no adult members. Thus, for Figure 2, which only includes adult
females, ‘no missing members’ and ‘well sampled’ are one and the same.
However, we have added the word “adult” to the Figure 2 caption and the
clause “those for which all adult females were genetically sampled” to the
Table 1 caption, to minimize the potential for confusion.
Sentence at Lines 17-18 is awkward (Page 29).
Rephrased.
Likewise Table 7 and 8 were presented out of order in text.
Corrected.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors present a study on patterns of association between known individual
sperm whales in Dominica, and compare this with kinship patterns inferred from
genetic data. Crucially the authors wanted to help determine the extent to which
sperm whale groups are matrilineal. This is an interesting topic and worth
publishing, and I agree with the authors sentiment that although sperm whales are
normally described as matrilineal, there is not so much data supporting it and is
likely not entirely accurate. There are some limitations in terms of sample size and
geographic coverage, but it's not easy to obtain this data from sperm whales so
sample sizes are never going to be ideal. I think the data presented generally
supports the idea that sperm whales are not strictly matrilineal, but that juveniles
accompanying their mothers are an important component of observed social
groups.
However, I feel the authors focus too much on the drivers and evolutionary aspect
of the data to the detriment of exploring the range of possible matrilineal societies,
and how these can change even within species. In the discussion there is little
integration with studies on other cetacean species that also show matrilineality, and
this would be important at all levels of discussion. For example, the discussion about
how the levels of matrilineality change depending on region in sperm whales, there
is no mention about this also being seen in killer whales. Generally, I think the
discussion needs to focus more on comparing these patterns with those found in
other cetacean groups, as opposed to the relatively long discussion about
evolutionary drivers, which is mostly speculative and generic, thus providing little
extra insight.
We have reworked the introduction and discussion to remove much of the
discussion about evolutionary drivers and refocus on matrilineality, including
comparing these patterns with those found in killer whales.
Similarly, the Introduction should focus more on the idea of several levels of
matrilineality, rather than mentioning it only in the Methods. Therefore, I'm
recommending the paper be rejected at this stage, but encourage resubmission of a
refocused version. I include below some more specific comments.
We have expanded on the idea of several levels of matrilineality in the
introduction.
Main comments:
I found the methods section about the social association aspect hard to follow at
times. I understand this is not the easiest topic to describe, but I found it hard to
fully grasp what was being considered as part of the same group. The terminology
used also made it hard to distinguish between the different types of groups defined.
For example, the term "social unit" although probably correct, makes it confusing
when the terms "social group", "unit" and "group" appear elsewhere in the paper
(quite frequently as well). Please try and rephrase this section to try and make the
social analyses a bit clearer and easy to follow.
Box 1 added to highlight and clarify definitions. Also, see overall comment at
start of our reply.
I also felt that some more detail about the different time gaps for defining groups is
needed. Considering animals seen in the same day as part of the same group seems
slightly optimistic, but accept that there might be good data to support this. So
please do consider adding some words to explain the strategic choices in this aspect
of the study.
Considering animals seen in the same day as associated was included to
capture any large scale social preferences and avoidances, but it did not
contribute to the delineation of social units. We have expanded on this section
to justify the inclusion of this spatiotemporal scale.
The number of tables is slightly excessive, with table 7 and 8 only being mentioned
in the discussion. Please consider whether all of these are required in the main text.
We merged Tables 1 and 3, and moved Tables 7 and 8 to the supplementary
materials.
Pages 2-3, lines 54-4: as written, it is slightly difficult to understand the hierarchical
structure. Please try and rewrite to make it easier to understand by someone who
isn't familiar with sperm whale social structure.
See overall comment at start of our reply.
Page 9, lines 25-32: from this description it appears that the results form the
maternity inference are not included in this, but I feel it should. Haplotype sharing
does not necessarily mean relatedness, particularly in a species with low mtDNA
diversity.
We certainly acknowledge that haplotype sharing does not necessarily
indicate kinship. This is why we also used pairwise relatedness in this section
of the analysis, because it is a finer measure of kinship. Additionally, while we
did not include the results from the maternity inference here, they were part
of our assessment of kinship affecting social association at the level of social
unit membership.
Page 9, line 41: I think this is a good strategy, but feel it would be best if this
distinction between well/poorly sampled groups would be more useful earlier on in
the methods regarding the analyses. I found myself wondering about how many
groups were fully sampled for all this data, so mentioning the distinction earlier
helps clear that early on.
We have moved this distinction to earlier in the Methods, where we describe
how we delineated social units.
Page 10, lines 5-20: this section should be present in the Introduction when this is
first mentioned
We have moved the explanation of the overall idea behind outlining multiple
categories of matrilineality to the introduction.
Page 11, lines 31-34: this is fair enough and expected from sloughed skin samples,
but authors need to specify how were inconsistencies between the three reactions
dealt with.
This is specified in the Methods, in the section on microsatellite genotyping: “If
scores from replicate reactions for an individual were inconsistent, additional
reactions were performed until one genotype score emerged as at least 100
times more likely (based on above error rates) than the other observed scores.
If this likelihood ratio was not achieved in a reasonable number of reactions,
no data was included in the analysis for that individual at that locus.”
Page 12, lines 3-5: I can see why this was done, but there is a problem of circularity.
If mtDNA haplotype was used to confirm kinship inferred from other methods, then
it's not really appropriate to assume similar mtDNA based on other lines of
evidence. In other words, mtDNA should not be inferred and used as confirmatory
evidence at the same time.
We acknowledge that this would be an issue if the inferred mtDNA haplotypes
of these three calves had been used as confirmatory evidence for maternity
assignment, but they were not. Rather, it is given the consistent of agreement
we found between mtDNA haplotypes and microsatellite-based maternity
assignments for other calves that we were able to confidently infer the mtDNA
of these calves for which the sequencing reactions failed based on their
mother’s haplotype. We have rephrased this section of our manuscript to
clarify this.
Page 13, lines 56-58: given that only two haplotypes were found, not sure this
results mean much. Please consider how these analyses can be affected by the low
mtDNA diversity.
Lines 56-58 on page 13 do not address mtDNA haplotypes, so we assume the
reviewer is referring to the last lines on page 12. We agree that the limited
mtDNA diversity affects the conclusions that can be drawn from these results,
and we address this in the Discussion.
Page 14, lines 24-27: I would prefer if this was phrased as this study improving on
the what has been done in previous studies. Samples sizes are still not that great,
and for some social units they can be quite low. Also, please add citations of the
"previous studies" to the end of the sentence. Please consider revising.
Rephrased, and citation added.
Page 14, lines 55-57: Instead of the word "suggesting", write instead "raises the
possibility" (or something similar), as the evidence for this is quite circumstantial at
this point.
Rephrased.
Page 15, lines 3-20: I think the discussion of group merging needs to consider the
various time criteria used to accept individuals as part of the same group. Seeing
two units in the same day might does not necessarily mean they are associating.
As mentioned in a previous response, considering animals seen in the same
day as associated was included to capture any large scale social preferences
and avoidances, but it did not contribute to the delineation of social units.
Additionally, we hope our addition of Box 1 will help clarify our definitions of
groups and social units (and we have added a reference to this box/definition
in this section). We also added a comment in this section to highlight that our
method of delineating social units is in line with (or more stringent than)
studies on other populations, but we agree that it is of note that this definition
may still not be stringent enough. We have revised this paragraph to mention
this point.
Page 15, lines 22-24: this is only true if we assume that similarity in behaviour drives
the high association, but high association might actually be driving the behaviour
similarity. Not saying what is written is incorrect, only that it needs more
information to be credible.
This section has been removed from the manuscript, in response to another
comment.
Page 16, Lines 25-38: I don't think this paragraph holds up particularly well, when
the discussion clearly stated before that kinship was not a driver of association. If
the authors think the two groups are similar, I suggest this is rephrased for clarity.
Our discussion did state that kinship was generally not a driver of association
specifically between social units, but we found that it was a driver within
social units. This paragraph and others in the discussion have been revised to
make this clearer.
Page 17, lines 38-40: I think the main contribution of this paper is the idea that that
there can be different level of matrilineality. Sperm whales will show one of the
levels, but clearly not the strict matrilineality that are found in other cetacean
species
See ‘General response to comments on matrilineality’.

Please rewrite for clarity.
Rewritten.
Page 5, lines 39-43: Please only state the final number of microsatellites amplified
(18 in this case).
As suggested we have re-worded this section to only include the final number
of microsatellites amplified, to eliminate the potential for confusion on the
final number used. However, we believe there is merit in reporting the
microsatellite loci which did not amplify well, to assist other researchers
working on cetacean genetics in selecting which loci they should try. Thus, we
still refer here to the supplemental table that includes the excluded loci.

I've read the resubmited version as well as the response to reviewers, and I'm happy
to say that the manuscript is now much improved, with a much tighter focus and
more solid narrative. I feel the authors addressed the reviewers comments well,
providing adequate clarifications for those recommendations tht were not
necessarily directly followed reviewer suggestions. Box 1 is very useful in clarifying
terms, and I think the manuscript is now consistently clear in how the different type
of groups are presented and discussed. I make only some minor suggestions for
improvements, some of which are admitedly minor nitpicks. Generallly, I think the
manuscript is now acceptable for publication, and will be an important addition to
the academic literature. Congratulatins ot the authors for an interesting study, that I
much enjoyed reading.
Thank you for your positive feedback and for your constructive and helpful
comments which helped improve our manuscript.
Final comments
I find it slightly odd that large sections of laboratory protocols have been moved to
the supplement. Generally, I think those were fine in the main text, and even
preferably located there. The information will still be available to readers though, so
it might be ok as a supplement.
This was done in response to a suggestion by reviewer one. As noted, the
information will still be available to readers.
I think the discussion about the lack of association between social unit association
and kinship was interesting, and think the authors could keep that in the final
version.
In response to feedback from the other reviewer, and to allow for a more
focused overall narrative and discussion, we have reduced/removed several
aspects of the discussion. For interested parties, more lengthy discussion of
the topic can be found in the MSc thesis of C. Konrad (available at:

Page 3, line 24: I think the authors meant to write "published for only a few species
to date"
We have clarified this, rephrasing to “published for only a few social units to
date”.
Page 3, lines 26-27: consider writing instead "considered matrilineality generically
and as a simple dichotomy"
Rephrased, as suggested.
Page 3, Line 28: am I correct in thinking that it's not only females that would stay,
but rather all offspring? This has been my understanding, so please consider what is
more appropriate.
Rephrased to add the clause “or all offspring, in species without male
dispersion”. The sentence now reads: “In conventional wisdom, ‘matrilineal’
would refer to social units where most females (or all offspring, in species
without male dispersion) remain, for life, with their mothers and other close
female relatives”
Page 3, line 46: write instead "address questions regarding the"
Rewritten.
Box 1, definition of Group: slightly unusual wording calling "collections" of
individuals. Consider using a different word
Rephrased from ‘temporary collections of whales traveling together” to “sets
of whales temporarily traveling together”
page 13, Line 37: please consider rephrasing "statistically significantly positively", to
avoid so many word finishing in y in a row.
Rephrased to “association was statistically significantly and positively
correlated with pairwise relatedness”.
Page 15, Line 24: Rely, not "reply"
Corrected.
