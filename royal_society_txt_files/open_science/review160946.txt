This is an extension of the author's previous work (Nakahashi, 2008) on a quantitative genetic
model of sexual selection. In this paper, the author considers cultural inheritance of the trait and
the preference to make the model applicable to the human case. The analysis seems sound and
the findings are generally interesting. I have two concerns. First, I wonder if the process
3
considered in the model is to be called cultural sexual selection. As described below, it does not
seem essential in the model that the preference of the choosy sex affects the reproductive success
of the chosen sex. Second, there are places in the text where claims are made rather freely without
reference to relevant literature (see below).
In the basic model (2.1. Cultural trait and cultural preference), the preference determines an
individual's popularity, which is converted into reproductive success. However, the latter
assumption is superfluous; that is, since nothing is transmitted from parents to offspring, all that
matters is the popularity and whether or not it has a reproductive consequence is irrelevant to the
evolutionary dynamics. In fact, those with fewer offspring can even have more cultural
descendants depending on parameter values. In this sense, the trait and the preference are not
"sexually selected."
The trivial equilibrium, (theta, theta), is always unstable if parameter b is larger than the critical
value specified by (26a). Though not mentioned, there is also a critical value for parameter a
above which the equilibrium is always unstable. Parameter a is said to describe the aversion of
unpopular individuals when copying the trait. However, when a is large, it also means the
aversion of trait variants that are more or less average, or the selective adoption of deviant types,
which seems to destabilize the equilibrium even in the absence of the preference. Similarly,
although b is interpreted as the aversion of unpopular individuals when acquiring the preference,
it also means (when b is large) the selective adoption of the preference for deviant types, which
naturally destabilizes the equilibrium. In other words, when either a or b exceeds the thresholds,
the evolution does not seem to proceed in a runaway fashion. The population rather seems to
grow away from the equilibrium due to strong learning biases favoring deviant types.
Considering these, it seems to me that the most interesting part of the study is the findings for the
case 0<a<1 and 0<b<1. I would suggest that the paper put more emphasis on this part.
Appendix A. I could not replicate the derivation of (A. 1). Please check if it is correct.
In section 2.2, genetic inheritance of the trait is considered. Here, the trait is sexually selected
because popular trait types are always more likely to be transmitted to the succeeding generation.
Mathematically speaking, the model in this section is equivalent to the case 0<a<1 in the basic

Section 2.4 deals with the case when the preference is genetically inherited. The model is
mathematically included in the basic model as a special case. As in the basic model, the trait is not
sexually selected because the number of offspring does not matter to the evolution of the trait.

(abilities), such as bipedalism, intelligence, creativity, language, art, and music" (L346). Who have

"In humans, strange mating preferences, such as those for small feet (foot binding) or long necks
(neck rings), are sometimes observed ..." (L394). The choice of the word "strange" seems
awkward. Perhaps they look strange only to outsiders.

The author mentions several human sexual preferences that he states
are adaptive (for example, breast size and femininity of facial
features). The cited studies, however, seem to me to only provide
evidence that the preference exists, not that it is adaptive. An
alternative interpretation of these preferences is that they arise
from receiver bias, as discussed for example in my paper "An
ethological theory of attractiveness"
(http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2001-05852-005). I think it would be
more correct to tone down this statement by saying that these
preferences "may be" adaptive, but also that other suggestions for
their origin exist. Indeed, these suggestions are not much unlike the
present models in that preferences are the driving force.

Reviewer: 2
This is an extension of the author's previous work (Nakahashi, 2008) on a
quantitative genetic model of sexual selection. In this paper, the author
considers cultural inheritance of the trait and the preference to make the
model applicable to the human case. The analysis seems sound and the
findings are generally interesting. I have two concerns. First, I wonder if the
process considered in the model is to be called cultural sexual selection. As
described below, it does not seem essential in the model that the preference
of the choosy sex affects the reproductive success of the chosen sex.
Second, there are places in the text where claims are made rather freely
without reference to relevant literature (see below).
In the basic model (2.1. Cultural trait and cultural preference), the preference
determines an individual's popularity, which is converted into reproductive
success. However, the latter assumption is superfluous; that is, since nothing
is transmitted from parents to offspring, all that matters is the popularity and
whether or not it has a reproductive consequence is irrelevant to the
evolutionary dynamics. In fact, those with fewer offspring can even have
more cultural descendants depending on parameter values. In this sense, the
trait and the preference are not "sexually selected."
¦ In contrast to genetic transmission, cultural transmission is not restricted to vertical
(from parents to offspring). Therefore, in cultural evolution, we regard that a culture
is selected if its frequency changed between generations, although the reproductive
success of its carrier does not necessarily affect the change. In the model, the change
of trait is essentially influenced by mating success of individuals, so that it is natural
to call the process as sexual selection. In fact, other papers that considered the
cultural transmission of traits affecting mating success used the term sexual selection
to the process (e.g. Refs 38, 39). Moreover, since the model is an extension of a
quantitative genetic model of sexual selection (as the reviewer pointed out), it may
be better to use the term sexual selection to avoid unnecessary confusion of readers.
Therefore, I keep using the term “cultural sexual selection” in this paper, but to
resolve the concern of the reviewer, I have added an explanation why I use the term
sexual selection to this process (L370-373).
The trivial equilibrium, (theta, theta), is always unstable if parameter b is
larger than the critical value specified by (26a). Though not mentioned, there
is also a critical value for parameter a above which the equilibrium is always
unstable. Parameter a is said to describe the aversion of unpopular
individuals when copying the trait. However, when a is large, it also means
the aversion of trait variants that are more or less average, or the selective
adoption of deviant types, which seems to destabilize the equilibrium even in
the absence of the preference. Similarly, although b is interpreted as the
aversion of unpopular individuals when acquiring the preference, it also
means (when b is large) the selective adoption of the preference for deviant
types, which naturally destabilizes the equilibrium. In other words, when
either a or b exceeds the thresholds, the evolution does not seem to proceed
in a runaway fashion. The population rather seems to grow away from the
equilibrium due to strong learning biases favoring deviant types. Considering
these, it seems to me that the most interesting part of the study is the
findings for the case 0<a<1 and 0<b<1. I would suggest that the paper put
more emphasis on this part.
¦ Following the comment, I have deleted a sentence that explained the similarity
between runaway process and the destabilization caused by large b (L406), and
added sentences that emphasize the finding that the destabilization can occur even
when 0<a<1 and 0<b<1 (L416-420).
Appendix A. I could not replicate the derivation of (A. 1). Please check if it is
correct.
¦ Although the derivation is complex, we can easily confirm its correctness by using
math-software such as Mathematica.
In section 2.2, genetic inheritance of the trait is considered. Here, the trait is
sexually selected because popular trait types are always more likely to be
transmitted to the succeeding generation. Mathematically speaking, the
model in this section is equivalent to the case 0<a<1 in the basic model (i.e.,
section 2.1), though the interpretations of the assumptions are different.
Section 2.4 deals with the case when the preference is genetically inherited.
The model is mathematically included in the basic model as a special case.
As in the basic model, the trait is not sexually selected because the number
of offspring does not matter to the evolution of the trait.
"... sexual selection theory has been applied to many sexually monomorphic
human traits (abilities), such as bipedalism, intelligence, creativity, language,
art, and music" (L346). Who have done this? Relevant literature should be
cited to avoid attacking a straw man.
¦ Following the comment, I have added some references here (L342; Refs 42-44).
"In humans, strange mating preferences, such as those for small feet (foot
binding) or long necks (neck rings), are sometimes observed ..." (L394). The
choice of the word "strange" seems awkward. Perhaps they look strange only
to outsiders.
¦ Following a comment of reviewer 3, I have changed “strange” to “peculiar” (see
my response to reviewer 3), which may reduce the negative connotation of this
sentence. I think, even if a culture is familiar to insiders, we can describe it as
“peculiar” provided that it is unfamiliar to many readers.
"Humans tend to give greater weight to negative entities than positive ones,
known as 'negativity bias'" (L403). This sentence is too strong, given that
there exists the opposite claim: see e.g., Sharot (2012) "The Optimism Bias:
Why We're Wired to Look on the Bright Side".
¦ Following the comment, I have toned down this sentence (L401-402).
"In humans, male preferences are often incomprehensible to females and
vice versa ..." (L420). Cite relevant literature.
¦ Following the comment, I have added some references here (L421; Refs 52-53).
"... strange decorative cultural traits are generally more often observed in
females than in males in semi-monogamous human populations" (L446). Cite
relevant literature.
¦ I have rewritten this sentence (L445-446).
Reviewer: 3
This paper presents a number of theoretical models that introduce cultural
traits and/or preferences in sexual selection models of monogamous species.
The modeling is straightforward yet original, and the author did an excellent
job of keeping model complexity at possibly the absolute minimum required
to study this complex topic.
The paper clearly presents the author's arguments and conclusions, but I
suggest a few minor changes.
The author often uses the term "strange" to refer to cultural preferences. In
English, however, "strange" carries a negative connotation that is
inappropriate here. I would use "peculiar," and perhaps use "exaggerated" to
describe traits that are pushed toward extreme values that would not be
observed without sexual selection. The latter term is common in the
biological literature.
¦ Following the comment, I have changed “strange” to “peculiar” for preferences
and to “exaggerated” for traits.
The author mentions several human sexual preferences that he states are
adaptive (for example, breast size and femininity of facial features). The cited
studies, however, seem to me to only provide evidence that the preference
exists, not that it is adaptive. An alternative interpretation of these
preferences is that they arise from receiver bias, as discussed for example in
my paper "An ethological theory of attractiveness"
(http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2001-05852-005). I think it would be more
correct to tone down this statement by saying that these preferences "may
be" adaptive, but also that other suggestions for their origin exist. Indeed,
these suggestions are not much unlike the present models in that
preferences are the driving force.
¦ Following the comment, I have toned down the explanations and cited the
suggested paper (L96-100; Ref 24).
