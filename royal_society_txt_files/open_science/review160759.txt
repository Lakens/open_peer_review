The manuscript makes use of the 4D Clifford algebra to develop a generalization to 3D frames of
the Rankine’s reciprocal diagrams for 3D trusses. An exhaustive number of examples illustrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method.
The paper is very interesting and further applications to civil engineering appear promising.
It is opinion of the present reviewer that the manuscript can be accepted for publication in Royal
Society Open Science after the following minor revisions:
1) Equation (1.1): introduce a symbol for the “oriented area of polygon” instead of using words;
2) Sect. 3: “All terms … will be defined in the section that immediately follows”. The reader
cannot understand Sect. 3 without reading Sect. 4. Consider to merge the two sections or define
each quantity directly in Sect. 3. (See Appendix B)

Review of: “The Geometry of Structural Equilibrium” by Alan McRobie
Introduction
<U+F0B7> This section should provide more general introduction of the fundamental topics and principles of
graphic statics (notably, reciprocal diagrams). Considering the wide audience of this journal, jumping
straight into 4D Clifford algebra and bivectors to introduce the topic may be too advanced, even for
most experienced user of graphic statics.
<U+F0B7> Figure 1
o “Oriented area of the base is then equal to the total oriented area of the sides.” <U+F0E0> oriented area
generated from two vectors as their wedge vectors is shown, as a square. However, how is the
oriented area of multiple sides determined? Or a polygon? Showing this equality (which is
obvious, but important) clearly in a visual and graphical manner is necessary, as it is the
central idea behind every aspect of the presented paper.
o “circumnavigation of the polygonal loop” <U+F0E0> showing this visually (maybe as edge directions)
will help in reading the diagrams clearly.
<U+F0B7> Page 3, line 51/52: There is no figure 1c. Labelling needs to be corrected/updated.
<U+F0B7> Page 3, line 52/53: “oriented area of any closed polyhedron is zero” <U+F0E0> this may be intuitively obvious,
but how is the oriented area of a polyhedron determined? Are the oriented area from two vectors,
oriented area from a series of joined faces, oriented area of a polyhedron all determined the same way?
<U+F0B7> Page 4, line 14: it would be beneficial to show the six independent bivectors graphically, as they are
elements that are consistently used and referred to throughout the paper.
Section 3
<U+F0B7> Page 5: Can any of this information be visually represented? Equations 3.1 and 3.2 could benefit from a
corresponding diagram, as the subscripts, superscripts and capitalization of the symbols make it very
difficult and confusing to visualize what they are intending to describe. It is stated repeatedly
throughout the paper that all details can be distilled from the graphical constructions. While the
emphasis of this paper is on geometry and visual representations, it is a pity that these concepts are not
accompanied by any visual descriptions.
<U+F0B7> The author must clarify the difference between “topological dual” and “reciprocal,” and they certainly
cannot be used interchangeably within the context of graphic statics.
Section 4
<U+F0B7> Page 8, line 51/52: “oriented volume” needs to be defined; also needs to be clarified here, that the zero
total oriented volume of all prisms is only true for self-stressed structures.
Section 5
<U+F0B7> Figure 3
o This series of images could benefit from showing an immediate step (where a = 0.5), to show
more clearly geometric relationship between the two pairs of images (as in McRobie (2015),
where 3 steps of alpha are shown for the Minkowski sum diagrams). Alternatively, an
enlarged image highlighting the shape of a polyhedron from the left side to the right side will
help in observing this relationship. As shown, it is very difficult to make any meaningful
visual observations from these diagrams.
Section 6
<U+F0B7> Page 11, line 8, 9: The user has considerable freedom to place additional nodes anywhere. But how is
this “freedom” beneficial for any design or practical purposes?
<U+F0B7> Figure 4: This diagram would benefit greatly from a bit of colour coding and consistency in visual
notations.
Section 7
<U+F0B7> Page 12, line 42/43: Once a gauche polygon is constructed to solve incompleteness, why would a user
desire to introduce any more face cushions after that? Wouldn’t that just make the gauche polygon
unnecessarily complex?
<U+F0B7> Figure 5
o The view angles of 5def (especially the gauche pentagon GSABT in 5e), seems to be
inconsistent with others. Orienting Figures 5e and 5f to the same view angles would be
beneficial to the clarity of the diagrams. Figure 5e is also the only one that is orthographic
drawing in a different scale, which could be oriented to the same isometric view angle as
5abcef without losing clarity.
o (also in general) cells of the form diagram, and the cells of the force diagram should be clearly
labelled.
<U+F0B7> Faces and polygons in figure 5 could benefit from showing the polygonal loops, especially 5def, at the
intersection of the two tetrahedra.
Section 8
<U+F0B7> Figure 6:
o 6a and 6c can be visually improved, by showing which edges are on top, as in Figure 9a (for
example, adding small white gaps where the edges cross visually to portray that they are not
overlapping on the same plane).
Section 9
<U+F0B7> Figure 7:
o The terminology needs to be consistent: “prism cells” in 7a are referred to as “original cell” in
7b, where “connecting prism” is also introduced. Would it be more correct to say “load face of
the force polyhedron” instead of just “force polygon”?
o (also in general): 3d line drawings could benefit from using colour, especially to illustrate
different properties (axial, load, moment, shear), especially now that polyhedral faces/gauch-
polygons no longer mean just axial forces, necessarily. It will also help with the legibility and
consistency of the diagrams.
<U+F0B7> Page 16, lines 22/23: “In the graphic analysis of gridshells by other methods, a difficulty can arise at
the edges.” <U+F0E0> how? Should mention here, that “other [graphical] methods” address gridshells as 3d
pin-jointed trusses, not as 3d, moment-bearing frame as it does in this section. The shape of funicular
shells at the roof edges naturally take the inclined shape, and the author needs to show why this is
necessarily a “difficulty.”

This is an interesting but minor comment. I think little is gained by this, and I have already
used the symbol A for other meanings, so I am afraid I have not adopted this suggestion.
2) Sect. 3: “All terms … will be defined in the section that immediately follows”. The reader
cannot understand Sect. 3 without reading Sect. 4. Consider to merge the two sections or
define each quantity directly in Sect. 3.
This is a substantial comment, and I have made large structural changes to the ordering of the
material in the early parts of the manuscript in order to address this comment.
Review of: “The Geometry of Structural Equilibrium” by Allan McRobie
Introduction
This section should provide more general introduction of the fundamental topics and principles of
graphic statics (notably, reciprocal diagrams). Considering the wide audience of this journal, jumping
straight into 4D Clifford algebra and bivectors to introduce the topic may be too advanced, even for
most experienced user of graphic statics.
This section has been re-written in light of the Reviewer’s comment.
Figure 1
o “Oriented area of the base is then equal to the total oriented area of the sides.” oriented area
generated from two vectors as their wedge vectors is shown, as a square. However, how is the
oriented area of multiple sides determined? Or a polygon? Showing this equality (which is
obvious, but important) clearly in a visual and graphical manner is necessary, as it is the
central idea behind every aspect of the presented paper.
o “circumnavigation of the polygonal loop” showing this visually (maybe as edge directions)
will help in reading the diagrams clearly.
This section has been re-written in light of the Reviewer’s comment, and Fig 1 has been expanded to make the
construction clearer.
Page 3, line 51/52: There is no figure 1c. Labelling needs to be corrected/updated.
Corrected.
Page 3, line 52/53: “oriented area of any closed polyhedron is zero” this may be intuitively obvious,
but how is the oriented area of a polyhedron determined? Are the oriented area from two vectors,
oriented area from a series of joined faces, oriented area of a polyhedron all determined the same way?
This section has been re-written in light of the Reviewer’s comment, and Fig 1 has been expanded to make the
construction clearer.
Page 4, line 14: it would be beneficial to show the six independent bivectors graphically, as they are
elements that are consistently used and referred to throughout the paper.
This is an interesting comment, but it is difficult, and my attempts to show these did not really help, so I have not
included these.
Section 3
Page 5: Can any of this information be visually represented? Equations 3.1 and 3.2 could benefit from a
corresponding diagram, as the subscripts, superscripts and capitalization of the symbols make it very
difficult and confusing to visualize what they are intending to describe. It is stated repeatedly
throughout the paper that all details can be distilled from the graphical constructions. While the
emphasis of this paper is on geometry and visual representations, it is a pity that these concepts are not
accompanied by any visual descriptions.
This section has been re-written in light of the comments of both Reveiwers, and a new figure (Fig 3) has now been
included to make the construction clearer.
The author must clarify the difference between “topological dual” and “reciprocal,” and they certainly
cannot be used interchangeably within the context of graphic statics.
This has now been made clearer. As now explained in Section 3c, because we have extended the theory of reciprocal
diagrams, we have extended the use of the word reciprocal.
Section 4
Page 8, line 51/52: “oriented volume” needs to be defined; also needs to be clarified here, that the zero
total oriented volume of all prisms is only true for self-stressed structures.
The section has been reworded such that reference to oriented volume has been removed.
Section 5
Figure 3
o This series of images could benefit from showing an immediate step (where a = 0.5), to show
more clearly geometric relationship between the two pairs of images (as in McRobie (2015),
where 3 steps of alpha are shown for the Minkowski sum diagrams). Alternatively, an
enlarged image highlighting the shape of a polyhedron from the left side to the right side will
help in observing this relationship. As shown, it is very difficult to make any meaningful
visual observations from these diagrams.
The <U+F061> = 0.5 images exist but are not instructive, and so have not been included. The meaning of the phrase “shape of a
polyhedron from the left side to the right side” was unclear and so has not been included. It is admittedly difficult to
obtain visual information from these diagrams, but that is a challenge for future research.
Section 6
Page 11, line 8, 9: The user has considerable freedom to place additional nodes anywhere. But how is
this “freedom” beneficial for any design or practical purposes?
It has now been explained that the benefit is that they expand the space of possible solutions.
Figure 4: This diagram would benefit greatly from a bit of colour coding and consistency in visual
notations.
This diagram has now been expanded into three diagrams, and some colour has been used. This is now clearer.
Section 7
Page 12, line 42/43: Once a gauche polygon is constructed to solve incompleteness, why would a user
desire to introduce any more face cushions after that? Wouldn’t that just make the gauche polygon
unnecessarily complex?
No, sometimes it will be necessary to use a combination of gauche polygons and face cushions to represent all
possible estates of stress.
Figure 5
o The view angles of 5def (especially the gauche pentagon GSABT in 5e), seems to be
inconsistent with others. Orienting Figures 5e and 5f to the same view angles would be
beneficial to the clarity of the diagrams. Figure 5e is also the only one that is orthographic
drawing in a different scale, which could be oriented to the same isometric view angle as
5abcef without losing clarity.
o (also in general) cells of the form diagram, and the cells of the force diagram should be clearly
labelled.
Faces and polygons in figure 5 could benefit from showing the polygonal loops, especially 5def, at the
intersection of the two tetrahedra.
Section 8
This figure (now Fig 8) has now been improved as a result of the Reviewer’s suggestions.
Figure 6:
o 6a and 6c can be visually improved, by showing which edges are on top, as in Figure 9a (for
example, adding small white gaps where the edges cross visually to portray that they are not
This has now been done.
Section 9
Figure 7:
o The terminology needs to be consistent: “prism cells” in 7a are referred to as “original cell” in
7b, where “connecting prism” is also introduced. Would it be more correct to say “load face of
the force polyhedron” instead of just “force polygon”?
o (also in general): 3d line drawings could benefit from using colour, especially to illustrate
different properties (axial, load, moment, shear), especially now that polyhedral faces/gauchpolygons
no longer mean just axial forces, necessarily. It will also help with the legibility and
consistency of the diagrams.
The terminology in the diagram has now been changed, and some colour has been introduced.

the edges.” how? Should mention here, that “other [graphical] methods” address gridshells as 3d
pin-jointed trusses, not as 3d, moment-bearing frame as it does in this section. The shape of funicular
shells at the roof edges naturally take the inclined shape, and the author needs to show why this is
necessarily a “difficulty.”
This comment has now been addressed in the text.
