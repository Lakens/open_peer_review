This is a great paper. I like it a lot. It should definitely be published. My only criticisms are minor
typo issues.
L 131 the 2nd enclosure size must be "for dogs" but it doesn't say so.
L 180 and perhaps elsewhere "form" where "from" is meant
L 203 abbrevs pc and mc are upper case elsewhere.
One question for the authors: Would the same absence of reconciliation in dogs be expected in
dogs living together in the same (human) household?
I think this paper could be of interested to the media once it comes out.

label_comment_2
In a very interesting and well-written manuscript, the authors observed aggressive encounters
and subsequent friendly behavior (i.e., reconciliation) of similarly raised dogs and wolves. I
found the data very interesting and the findings to follow from the data. I only have minor
comments:
General comments: perhaps a table outlining all of the predictions and whether you have support
for these predictions would be useful in the discussion section. But I do not find that this is
necessary.
I recommend that the authors bring in some of the literature that they reference in the
introduction, into the discussion section to help place the findings into the larger literature.
Where can we access the raw data?

Line 16– remove comma before “and”
Line 39 – add space before the last “and” on that line.
Line 41- replace “Canis lupus” with “Canis lupus familiaris” to be consisted with the next
paragraph.
Line 50- I suggest replacing “wolf packs” with “wolves” to improve the flow of the sentence.
Line 64- might be an interesting discussion to add of why the dogs, who are facultatively social
have such high rates of reconciliation compared to other very social species (e.g., chimps)
Line 80- suggesting removing the word “therefore” from the beginning of the sentence.
Line 83- I suggest rewording this sentence to improve flow. For example, “We characterized the
social relationship between opponents, based on daily observations, in terms of …”
Line 131- something is missing within the brackets. Is the second number the size of dog
enclosures?
Line 132- is the diet the same for wolves and dogs? This is more of a personal curiosity rather
than a comment on the manuscript.
Line 145: replace “10-minute” with “10 minutes”
Line 148 –“and towards whom they were directed”
Line 172- what was the exact number?
Line 175- it might be prudent to include k scores for each DV, or at least the median and the
range of kappa’s across measures.
Line 204 – there is an extra period in the beginning of that line.
Line 292- with only 55 aggressive outbursts, are you certain that you had enough power to detect
any differences, such as the number of attracted/dispersed PC-MC pairs, in dogs?
Line 268-275- could the low number of conflicts together with low numbers of unresolved
conflicts be a factor of the experimenter’s/caretaker’s selection of dogs into these packs? As dog
fights are more severe than wolf fights, I can imagine caretakers removing dogs who are
particularly aggressive with others or do not get along with certain members due to severe risks
of injury/death? Is there data on how many (if any) dogs were removed due to aggression from
these packs prior to the beginning of the study? Perhaps different populations of dogs are
different, but I often deal with dogs who have deadly encounters with others, meaning that I
would never place them into a group living/group play with others, and in such a way I am
artificially limiting the number of aggressive interactions and unresolved aggressive interactions.
Line 290- it may be helpful to very briefly (perhaps in the same sentence) state what this means to
help readers who are not as familiar with ethological methods?
Line 292 – a thought: may this lack of reconciliation in dogs be explained by the more intense
fights rather than a species difference?
Figure 1- I believe the “second” figure is an accidental replication of the first with different
formatting.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
Cafazzo and colleagues have performed a large-scale and ambitious comparison of aggression
and reconciliation in wolves and dogs raised and living in similar conditions. This study will be
informative. However, at the moment there are quite a few details (of the procedure, analyses,
etc) that must be clarified before the manuscript can be fully evaluated. Some changes need to be
made to the statistics and I have a couple suggestions for how to look at these data. Finally, I
would push the authors to further address the wolf-dog comparison in the discussion, which
they currently do not really do.
MAJOR COMMENTS:
1. Currently the procedure for calculating inter-observer reliability is not entirely clear and it
seems that it may have been completed inappropriately. Any measures that will be analyzed
separately should have their own inter-observer reliability. It is not appropriate to calculate an
overall inter-observer reliability for the entire dataset (e.g., all behavior) and then to subset the
data and look at specific behaviors, since those specific behaviors have not yet been validated as
reliable measures. Inter-observer reliability needs to be calculated for each measure that will be
analyzed.
2. Lines 246-260: some adjustments must be made to the mixed models. First, using likelihood
ratio tests, full models (i.e., with all test predictors) must be compared to null models that only
include random effects and control predictors. Only when the full model has a significantly better
fit than the null model is there justification to interpret the null model. P values for the fixed
effects in the full model should also be generated using likelihood ratio tests (comparing the full
model with a model in which an individual fixed effect is removed, to generate the significance of
that individual fixed effect).
Critically, backwards stepwise reduction procedures are not statistically sound. Full models with
all control and test predictors should be determined at the beginning and any such predictors
should not be removed from the model simply because they are not significant. Only
nonsignificant interactions can be removed from the model because these can obscure main
effects.

into signal pollution. The American Naturalist, 173(1), 119-123.
Forstmeier, W. & Schielzeth, H. 2011. Cryptic multiple hypotheses testing in linear models:
overestimated effect sizes and the winner’s curse. Behav Ecol Sociobiol, 65, 47-55.
3. The authors currently don’t find evidence of the influence of relationship quality on likelihood
of reconciliation; however, they currently investigate relationship asymmetry. If it is possible to
5
derive new measures without basically starting the study over, I think it would be hugely
informative to use a better measure of relationship quality. For example, others have used the
Composite Sociality Index (e.g., Wittig et al 2014 “Food sharing is linked to urinary oxytocin
levels and bonding in related and unrelated wild chimpanzees”). This measure is a particularly
meaningful assessment of relationship quality because it takes into account both affiliative and
aggressive interactions. Dyads with a high score thus have high rates of affiliation and low rates
of agonism, which is really what we mean when we refer to high-quality relationships. In
contrasts, measures that consider only affiliation or aggression are missing critical information
and may less fully describe the nature of a dyad’s relationship.
4. The authors should spend some time speculating about the species difference, relating it back
to their introduction and predictions. If indeed dogs do not exhibit reconciliation with
conspecifics but wolves do, why might dogs have lost this tendency during domestication?
5. A critical analysis to clarify this picture is to compare the number of unreconciled conflicts per
hour between wolves and dogs. It may be that dogs show a significantly lower rate of
unreconciled conflicts compared to wolves because they show so much lower rates of conflicts to
begin with. Reconciliation may be much more prevalent in wolves than dogs simply because
instances of conflict are much higher among wolves (i.e., because domestication of dogs has
produced more tolerant/less aggressive animals compared to their wild ancestors).
LESS MAJOR COMMENTS:
Line 180: typo—form should be from
Line 183: typo—form should be from
Lines 196: Although David’s scores are a common method for quantifying dominance, it may be
beneficial to provide more detail on how they are calculated and why this particular measure of
dominance was preferable to others.
Line 201: the authors should justify why, in reconciliation analyses, they only looked at dyads
that had participated in at least 3 conflicts. Also, the authors should be clearer in the main text
about the number of dyads and the number of conflicts in the analyses that are wolves and the
number that are dogs. One reason is that it would be useful to know whether potential species
differences in reconciliation could be explained by higher rates of aggression in general in one
species versus another or by the uniformity of dyadic conflicts (i.e., are conflicts restricted to
certain dyads in each species or do all dyads experience some degree of conflict in one or both
species? Since fewer than half of the possible dyads made it into the analyses, it appears that
there is some variation in whether or not dyads experience conflicts at all).
Lines 208-209: when outlining the planned analyses (e.g., in these lines) the authors should justify
the analysis. What was this analysis aiming to test? Whether reconciliation occurred more
frequently than no reconciliation? What is being tested in the second analysis on reconciliation is
also not clear (lines 209-216).
Lines 210-211: “compares the frequency of the first affiliative interactions between former
opponents as a function of time during the PCs with the equivalent distribution during the MCs”:
I’m not really sure what this means. Is it about how many affiliative interactions happen in each
10 minute period? This is an important variable and it should be defined more clearly. It’s not
clear that the chosen analyses are the best ones (why not mixed models that take into account and
control for repeated measures and various other confounds?) but to make this assessment, it’s
first necessary to know exactly the goals of the analyses.
6
Lines 217-219: again, it’s necessary to justify this measure. Why the corrected conciliatory
tendency as opposed to the variety of other ways of quantifying a dyad’s rate of reconciliation?
Lines 224-227: are the values examined here based on individual rates? What counts as an
individual case should be clarified (i.e., number or rates of X per aggressor, or per victim?).
Generally, I think these analyses should be from the perspective of the aggressor since that
individual is the one initiating the interactions. Again the use of nonparametric tests over mixed
models should be justified
Line 229: since reconciliation is again visited in this section but the PC-MC data are not directly
addressed, it’s unclear (1) what the separate purposes are of the measures generated here vs in
lines 201-221, and (2) how these measures are related. Were the measures comparing PC with MC
simply aimed at assessing whether each species shows evidence for reconciliation at all? Then the
measures from line 229 onward are about exploring variation in reconciliation but here any PC
instance of affiliation is classed as reconciliation, independent of whether/when affiliation
occurred within the complementary MC?
Lines 249-251: here it says explicitly that only attracted PC-MC cases are used in the analysis. If
this is in reference to lines 231-244, it should probably be made clear at the start of lines 231-244.
Line 253: why is the victim used as the random effect as opposed to the aggressor (who is actually
the actor)? Why not both?
Lines 277-278: are you really referring to frequency data, or is this analysis based on proportions?
It seems unlikely, given how many fewer incidents of aggression were documented in dogs, that
they actually exhibited an absolutely higher frequency of high intensity conflicts. I would also
like to see analyses comparing frequency of conflicts (or better, rate per hour of conflicts) between
dogs and wolves, which would presumably show that dogs exhibit significantly lower rates of
aggression and perhaps even significantly lower rates of high intensity aggression (i.e., incidents
of high intensity aggression per hour).

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Rosalind Arden):
Both Reviewers consider this will make a super contribution to the literature. They find it well-
written and on an interesting topic. Both suggest only minor revisions.
I notice that in the last sentence of the Abstract, the verb and subject are in disagreement
(factors/needs). It may read more clearly to start that 'the factors which promote.... need to be.."
If you would like to do some minor revisions, we would like to consider this paper for
publication. I am not keen on the table suggested by Reviewer two. Please be guided by the
comments provided by two Reviewers who are in strong agreement about the merits of this nice
paper.
We solicited a review from a third reviewer. You will see that their comments call for major
revision. What counts as major versus minor is not well-quantified. I hope that you will find the
comments helpful and constructive. The interest in this paper is clear and I very much hope that
you will choose to revise and resubmit.

Lines 249-251: here it says explicitly that only attracted PC-MC cases are used in the analysis. If
this is in reference to lines 231-244, it should probably be made clear at the start of lines 231-244.
Line 253: why is the victim used as the random effect as opposed to the aggressor (who is actually
the actor)? Why not both?
Lines 277-278: are you really referring to frequency data, or is this analysis based on proportions?
It seems unlikely, given how many fewer incidents of aggression were documented in dogs, that
they actually exhibited an absolutely higher frequency of high intensity conflicts. I would also
like to see analyses comparing frequency of conflicts (or better, rate per hour of conflicts) between
dogs and wolves, which would presumably show that dogs exhibit significantly lower rates of
aggression and perhaps even significantly lower rates of high intensity aggression (i.e., incidents
of high intensity aggression per hour).

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Rosalind Arden):
Three Reviewers agree that the work is exciting and interesting - well done for a great study. You
paid attention to Reviewers, comments and did lots of work to take advantage of their helpful
suggestions.The manuscript now reads very well. I would very much like to see the N in the
Summary - could you have one sentence, or clause, to say 'using 4 wolf packs and 4 dog packs' ?
I picked up a couple of tiny typo-style points. In line 48 you need an 'a' ('a particularly good
species', as I recall) and spotted a missing 's' plural in line 152, so I suggest one more close textual
read. Congratulations on a very nice piece of work.

ne question for the authors: Would the same absence of reconciliation in dogs be expected in dogs living
ogether in the same (human) household?
nfortunately, there are no studies investigating the level of reconciliation between dogs living with humans and
e think it is difficult to evaluate it given the human interference. In fact, most of the conflicts between pet dogs are
sually interrupted and/or avoided by human intervention. Human interference may have a great influence on the
hance for dogs to reconcile. To date, we don’t have enough data on reconciliation in dogs to really understand
he conditions under which it may occur.

n a very interesting and well-written manuscript, the authors observed aggressive encounters and subsequent
iendly behavior (i.e., reconciliation) of similarly raised dogs and wolves. I found the data very interesting and the
ndings to follow from the data. I only have minor comments:
eneral comments: perhaps a table outlining all of the predictions and whether you have support for these
redictions would be useful in the discussion section. But I do not find that this is necessary.
deed in the first draft we tried to have a table as you suggest but in the end we decided that it was not really
ecessary.
recommend that the authors bring in some of the literature that they reference in the introduction, into the
iscussion section to help place the findings into the larger literature.
e included some of the literature cited in the introduction in the discussion.
here can we access the raw data?
ata have been provided in the electronic supplementary material (see lines 283-284)
ine 16– remove comma before “and”
one
ine 39 – add space before the last “and” on that line.

one
ine 64- might be an interesting discussion to add of why the dogs, who are facultatively social have such high
ates of reconciliation compared to other very social species (e.g., chimps).
hanks for this comment. We agree that, from the result of Cools et al (2008) on reconciliation in dogs the CCT is
igher than that reported in chimpanzees. However, while we have a number of studies demonstrating that
econciliation occurs in chimpanzees regardless of their living conditions, unfortunately only the Cools’ study has
een carried out on reconciliation in dogs, and this was in captive conditions and with very few subjects in each
roups. The results of the study are therefore very premature. Therefore, a comparison with the data from
himpanzees also seems premature at this time.
ine 80- suggesting removing the word “therefore” from the beginning of the sentence.
one
ine 83- I suggest rewording this sentence to improve flow. For example, “We characterized the social relationship
etween opponents, based on daily observations, in terms of …”

ine 131- something is missing within the brackets. Is the second number the size of dog enclosures?
es it is, we added it.
ne 132- is the diet the same for wolves and dogs? This is more of a personal curiosity rather than a comment on
e manuscript.
deed the diet of dogs is a bit different from that of wolves, since they actually have somewhat different nutritional
quirements. Dogs are fed with a higher percentage of dry food than wolves. Wolves are regularly fed with pieces
carcass while dogs may receive them only sporadically.

ne 172- what was the exact number?
ne 175- it might be prudent to include k scores for each DV, or at least the median and the range of kappa’s
ross measures.
anks for this suggestion. We changed the text accordingly and we clearly specified the number of observations
ed for evaluating the inter-observer reliability (see lines 181-185).
ne 204 – there is an extra period in the beginning of that line.
anks, we deleted it
ne 292- with only 55 aggressive outbursts, are you certain that you had enough power to detect any differences,
ch as the number of attracted/dispersed PC-MC pairs, in dogs?
deed, in such kind of studies, the number of the total observations is not really important. The general agreement
to include only dyads with 3 or more PC-MC pairs in the analyses to have a chance of recording all three
ssibilities: attracted, neutral and dispersed pairs. This criterion was previously applied in studies with even lower
oportions of conflicts compared to the total number of individuals studied (e.g. see 51. Arnold K, Whiten A. 2001.
ost-conflict behaviour of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the Budongo forest, Uganda.
ehaviour 138, 649-690). We applied the same criterion in this study for both dogs and wolves.
ne 268-275- could the low number of conflicts together with low numbers of unresolved conflicts be a factor of
e experimenter’s/caretaker’s selection of dogs into these packs? As dog fights are more severe than wolf fights, I
n imagine caretakers removing dogs who are particularly aggressive with others or do not get along with certain
embers due to severe risks of injury/death? Is there data on how many (if any) dogs were removed due to
gression from these packs prior to the beginning of the study? Perhaps different populations of dogs are
ferent, but I often deal with dogs who have deadly encounters with others, meaning that I would never place
em into a group living/group play with others, and in such a way I am artificially limiting the number of aggressive
eractions and unresolved aggressive interactions.
is is indeed a problem that we encountered. The dogs escalate conflicts much more than wolves and we did
ve to remove some animals from the packs due to their aggressive inclinations. During the study 3 dogs had to
removed from the packs, whereas no wolf was taken out. While this is true and it most likely reduces the
mber of aggressive interactions/conflicts that occur, it should not influence whether dogs reconcile conflicts or
ot. Thus, the inadvertent selection probably reduced the number of conflicts in dogs in a positive manner in the
ogs compared to the wolves.
e added a sentence about that in the discussion (see lines 404-409)
ne 290- it may be helpful to very briefly (perhaps in the same sentence) state what this means to help readers
ho are not as familiar with ethological methods?
e add a definition (“the willingness to reconcile” ) in the introduction, thus the first time we used the term (see line
1).
ne 292 – a thought: may this lack of reconciliation in dogs be explained by the more intense fights rather than a
pecies difference?
ctually, we found that reconciliation in wolves is more likely to occur after high-intensity conflict than low-intensity
nes. Furthermore, in the study of Cools et al. (2008) on reconciliation in dogs, the authors found that, at least in
ne of the groups studied, the proportion of reconciled conflicts was greater in conflicts with grave aggression.
herefore, based on the current knowledge, we would exclude that the lack of reconciliation in dogs is a
onsequence of the more intense conflicts.
gure 1- I believe the “second” figure is an accidental replication of the first with different formatting.
hank you very much for this correction. In fact, we made a mistake during the submission. We corrected it.

afazzo and colleagues have performed a large-scale and ambitious comparison of aggression and reconciliation
wolves and dogs raised and living in similar conditions. This study will be informative. However, at the moment
ere are quite a few details (of the procedure, analyses, etc) that must be clarified before the manuscript can be
lly evaluated. Some changes need to be made to the statistics and I have a couple suggestions for how to look
these data. Finally, I would push the authors to further address the wolf-dog comparison in the discussion,
hich they currently do not really do.
AJOR COMMENTS:
Currently the procedure for calculating inter-observer reliability is not entirely clear and it seems that it may have
een completed inappropriately. Any measures that will be analyzed separately should have their own inter-
bserver reliability. It is not appropriate to calculate an overall inter-observer reliability for the entire dataset (e.g.,
l behavior) and then to subset the data and look at specific behaviors, since those specific behaviors have not
et been validated as reliable measures. Inter-observer reliability needs to be calculated for each measure that will
e analyzed.
hanks for this comment. Indeed, we calculated a kappa coefficient for each measure we used, but in the previous
ersion of the manuscript we just reported the mean coefficient. We now changed the paragraph following your
uggestion so that it reports all the values.
Lines 246-260: some adjustments must be made to the mixed models. First, using likelihood ratio tests, full
odels (i.e., with all test predictors) must be compared to null models that only include random effects and control
edictors. Only when the full model has a significantly better fit than the null model is there justification to interpret
e null model. P values for the fixed effects in the full model should also be generated using likelihood ratio tests
omparing the full model with a model in which an individual fixed effect is removed, to generate the significance
that individual fixed effect).
itically, backwards stepwise reduction procedures are not statistically sound. Full models with all control and test
edictors should be determined at the beginning and any such predictors should not be removed from the model
mply because they are not significant. Only nonsignificant interactions can be removed from the model because
ese can obscure main effects.

e thank the referee for the comment on the statistical approach. Based on this we approached a statistics’ expert
evaluate the most appropriate approach for our dataset. As suggested by the referee (and our expert) we no
nger adopted a model reduction based on p-values but rather compared different models using Akaike
formation Criterion (AICc), corrected for small sample sizes. In most cases there was not one model that was
ghly superior to another i.e. multiple models showed AiCc with only two units difference, rather than one model
owing a much larger AiCc. Based on this we found that a model averaging and multimodel inference approach
ve us additional information allowing us both to evaluate best model fits, but also extrapolate the “relative
portance of each variable” across different model. The overall results from this new approach (using the MuMin
ckage in R), are largely the same as those reported with the previous statistical method. Nevertheless they give
clearer picture of the variables affecting reconciliation. (see Burnham KP, Anderson DR (2002) Model selection
d multi-model inference: a practical information-theoretic approach 2nd edn. New York, NY: Springer. 488 p.
d Symonds RE, Moussalli A. (2011) A brief guide to model selection, multimodel inference and model averaging
behavioural ecology using Akaike’s information criterion. Behav Ecol Sociobiol 65:13–21).
The authors currently don’t find evidence of the influence of relationship quality on likelihood of reconciliation;
wever, they currently investigate relationship asymmetry. If it is possible to derive new measures without
sically starting the study over, I think it would be hugely informative to use a better measure of relationship
ality. For example, others have used the Composite Sociality Index (e.g., Wittig et al 2014 “Food sharing is
ked to urinary oxytocin levels and bonding in related and unrelated wild chimpanzees”). This measure is a
rticularly meaningful assessment of relationship quality because it takes into account both affiliative and
gressive interactions. Dyads with a high score thus have high rates of affiliation and low rates of agonism, which
really what we mean when we refer to high-quality relationships. In contrasts, measures that consider only
filiation or aggression are missing critical information and may less fully describe the nature of a dyad’s
lationship.
e rerun the analyses using a Composite Sociality index based on aggression and affiliation, but it did not
luence the occurrence of reconciliation. Since the models were more informative when using affiliation and
gression separately, we decided to report those. Finally, we decided to use the measure of relationship
ymmetry rather than the score since all models provided clearer results with them. Furthermore, also the rank
stance we used was indeed an asymmetric measure since it took into consideration whether the victim was
minant (negative rank distance) or subordinate (positive rank distance) to the aggressor.
The authors should spend some time speculating about the species difference, relating it back to their
roduction and predictions. If indeed dogs do not exhibit reconciliation with conspecifics but wolves do, why might
gs have lost this tendency during domestication?
e added and briefly discussed this point in the discussion (please see lines 456-461)
. A critical analysis to clarify this picture is to compare the number of unreconciled conflicts per hour between
olves and dogs. It may be that dogs show a significantly lower rate of unreconciled conflicts compared to wolves
ecause they show so much lower rates of conflicts to begin with. Reconciliation may be much more prevalent in
olves than dogs simply because instances of conflict are much higher among wolves (i.e., because
omestication of dogs has produced more tolerant/less aggressive animals compared to their wild ancestors).
hanks for these comment and suggestion. Indeed, the point is not if reconciliation is more or less frequent. The
rst step in this kind of study is to demonstrate whether reconciliation occurs or not. To do that, we used the two
ain statistic methods used in the literature to allow us possible comparison with previous studies. Following these
ethods it appears that reconciliation occurred in our wolves but not in our dogs. We added two figure and some
ore information for dogs (see lines 332-333) in order to clarify both the pattern of aggression and affiliation after
onflicts in both species. We hope they may help the reader to interpret the results.
erhaps what is more interesting however is not just that we found an absence of reconciliation in dogs but that
e found that dogs avoid each other after conflicts. Therefore, they appear to be using a different post conflict
trategy. We added a sentence to clarify this aspect in the discussion (see lines 447-448)
ESS MAJOR COMMENTS:
ine 180: typo—form should be from
ine 183: typo—form should be from
one, thanks for the corrections.
ines 196: Although David’s scores are a common method for quantifying dominance, it may be beneficial to
rovide more detail on how they are calculated and why this particular measure of dominance was preferable to
thers.
e added the information how to calculate the David’s score in the supplementary information. However,
xplaining why this measure was preferable to others would be beyond the scope of this paper.
ine 201: the authors should justify why, in reconciliation analyses, they only looked at dyads that had participated
at least 3 conflicts.
e used only dyads with 3 or more PC-MC pairs to have a chance for recording all three possible types of pair s
attracted, neutral and dispersed). This is according to the methodology used in previous studies (e.g. see 51.
rnold K, Whiten A. 2001. Post-conflict behaviour of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the
udongo forest, Uganda. Behaviour 138, 649-690).
lso, the authors should be clearer in the main text about the number of dyads and the number of conflicts in the
nalyses that are wolves and the number that are dogs.
one
ne reason is that it would be useful to know whether potential species differences in reconciliation could be
xplained by higher rates of aggression in general in one species versus another or by the uniformity of dyadic
onflicts (i.e., are conflicts restricted to certain dyads in each species or do all dyads experience some degree of
onflict in one or both species? Since fewer than half of the possible dyads made it into the analyses, it appears
hat there is some variation in whether or not dyads experience conflicts at all).
e thank the reviewer for this comment which is really interesting. We will be working on a paper looking more
pecifically at differences in rates, modality of aggression in wolves and dogs and this will be a great aspect to
clude. However as was explained above, for reconciliation analyses, the use only of dyads showing at least 3
onflicts is standard, therefore we will rather keep this suggestion in mind for the paper focusing on aggression.
s 208-209: when outlining the planned analyses (e.g., in these lines) the authors should justify the analysis.
at was this analysis aiming to test? Whether reconciliation occurred more frequently than no reconciliation?
at is being tested in the second analysis on reconciliation is also not clear (lines 209-216).
e we applied the two main methods largely used in the literature to assess the occurrence of reconciliation both
umans and animals, the PC-MC method and the time-rule method. Both methods are well described in the
rences cited. The PC-MC method is used to assess whether reconciliation occurs earlier in the PCs than in the
s (lines 216-221), while the time rule method aims to assess the minute/s during which reconciliation may be
sidered to occur (lines 222-231). Practically, this method identifies a time window after the conflict in which any
ative interaction between former opponents occur significantly earlier in the PC than in the MCs. The time rule
hod is indeed more conservative since, following this method a conflict should be considered reconciled only if
friendly contact between the former opponents occurs during the time window.
t of the studies on reconciliation apply both methods and, in order to make comparison with other species we
decided to use both (e.g. see Wittig RM, Boesch C. 2005. How to Repair Relationships - Reconciliation in
Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Ethology 111, 736-763; Peñate L, Peláez F, Sánchez S. 2009.

is lupus. Anim Behav. 90, 327-334)
s 210-211: “compares the frequency of the first affiliative interactions between former opponents as a function
me during the PCs with the equivalent distribution during the MCs”: I’m not really sure what this means. Is it
ut how many affiliative interactions happen in each 10 minute period? This is an important variable and it
uld be defined more clearly. It’s not clear that the chosen analyses are the best ones (why not mixed models
take into account and control for repeated measures and various other confounds?) but to make this
essment, it’s first necessary to know exactly the goals of the analyses.
rephrase the sentence (see lines 222-225) to make clearer the aim of the time rule method.
s 217-219: again, it’s necessary to justify this measure. Why the corrected conciliatory tendency as opposed
e variety of other ways of quantifying a dyad’s rate of reconciliation?
ed, the CCT is the standard way to quantifying dyad’s rate of reconciliation and it was previously used in
ves. So we deemed important to used this measure, again, to make a comparison possible.
s 224-227: are the values examined here based on individual rates? What counts as an individual case should
larified (i.e., number or rates of X per aggressor, or per victim?). Generally, I think these analyses should be
the perspective of the aggressor since that individual is the one initiating the interactions. Again the use of
parametric tests over mixed models should be justified
analysis was based on dyads and not individuals. We now specified that in the results. Please have a look at
electronic supplementary material where the table used for the analysis has been reported.
229: since reconciliation is again visited in this section but the PC-MC data are not directly addressed, it’s
lear (1) what the separate purposes are of the measures generated here vs in lines 201-221, and (2) how
e measures are related. Were the measures comparing PC with MC simply aimed at assessing whether each
cies shows evidence for reconciliation at all? Then the measures from line 229 onward are about exploring
ation in reconciliation but here any PC instance of affiliation is classed as reconciliation, independent of
ther/when affiliation occurred within the complementary MC?
first analysis was aimed to assess whether reconciliation occurs or not by comparing the timing of affiliative
ractions between former opponents between PCs and MCs (lines 212-239). In the case reconciliation
urred, as we assessed for wolves, we investigated the factors affecting its occurrence, duration, latency etc.
s 249-263). For these analyses we used only PCs in which reconciliation occurred, that means all PCs in
ch a friendly contact occurred earlier than in MCs. We have now clarified this in the text.
s 249-251: here it says explicitly that only attracted PC-MC cases are used in the analysis. If this is in
rence to lines 231-244, it should probably be made clear at the start of lines 231-244.
e the sentence of lines 249-251 is in reference to the test models used, we think it is not appropriate to move it
e previous paragraph.
253: why is the victim used as the random effect as opposed to the aggressor (who is actually the actor)?
y not both?
conciliation studies it is standard practice (in particular for first ‘exploratory’ studies), to consider the victim of
conflict as the focal animal/actor. We therefore inserted the victim as random factor, but also considered the
d and pack identity.
s 277-278: are you really referring to frequency data, or is this analysis based on proportions? It seems
kely, given how many fewer incidents of aggression were documented in dogs, that they actually exhibited an
olutely higher frequency of high intensity conflicts. I would also like to see analyses comparing frequency of
flicts (or better, rate per hour of conflicts) between dogs and wolves, which would presumably show that dogs
ibit significantly lower rates of aggression and perhaps even significantly lower rates of high intensity
ression (i.e., incidents of high intensity aggression per hour).
nks for this comment. Indeed the analysis here is based on proportion and now we clarified it in the
uscript. Anyway we also want to state that we carried out a comparable amount of hours of observation in
s and wolves therefore a comparison of frequency will lead to a similar result.

sociate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Rosalind Arden):
ee Reviewers agree that the work is exciting and interesting - well done for a great
dy. You paid attention to Reviewers, comments and did lots of work to take advantage
heir helpful suggestions.The manuscript now reads very well. I would very much like to
the N in the Summary - could you have one sentence, or clause, to say 'using 4 wolf
ks and 4 dog packs' ? I picked up a couple of tiny typo-style points. In line 48 you
ed an 'a' ('a particularly good species', as I recall) and spotted a missing 's' plural in line
2, so I suggest one more close textual read. Congratulations on a very nice piece of
rk.
ar Dr. Rosalind Arden,
thank you very much for your comments on our manuscript. We have addressed your
cerns and read carefully the manuscript for textual checking.
are very proud to have this opportunity to publish our work on Royal Society Open
cess.
