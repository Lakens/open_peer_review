The effects of precipitation, river discharge, land use and coastal circulation on water quality in
coastal Maine
Tilburg et al.
The need for timelier estimations of water quality has been acknowledged for both recreational
waters and shellfish waters. Historically, these waters have been managed using measurements
of culturable enteric bacteria as indicators, but the analysis is time-intensive, resulting in
questions of temporal scale. Alternately, rainfall has been used as a trigger for automatically
closing shellfish beds. In this manuscript, the authors explore the use of predictive models for
assessing water quality conditions, using hydrometeorological information that is more readily
available than indicator bacteria concentrations. The authors intensively explore the precipitation
patterns in large watersheds of coastal Maine to account for sources, intensity, and temporal
patterns of fecal contamination. Predictive models have been examined and applied with some
regularity in freshwater recreational waters, but their application in both marine systems and for
shellfish areas have been limited. The authors present a thorough investigation of land use and
precipitation patterns in these watersheds. The potential for application of their model is not
fully clear, and there are a few instances where the authors might exercise some restraint on the
implications of their findings. Overall, this is a well-designed study; it represents a novel
application of predictive models, with a potential for great benefit.
Specific comments:
In a few instances, correlation and causation are intermingled. For example, in the abstract, it is
stated that several parameters “have significant effects on water quality.” Also, in the
introduction, it is stated that physical mechanisms “may be responsible for reduced water
quality.” The ultimate cause of reduced water quality is the sewage input; coastal processes
merely concentrate or disperse the contaminant.
There are a few instances of questionable language. In the introduction (line 90-91), the language
“resulting in unsafe water conditions” might be changed instead to “resulting in exposure to
contaminated water”. ‘Unsafe’ doesn’t fully describe the condition here.
The introduction paragraph starting on line 87 is quite a mishmash of information; consider
reorganizing or splitting.
The description of the statistical models needs some clarity. In the decision model, were only
high discharge/high fecal coliforms selected?
On line 255, the wording ‘resulting in no unnecessary exposure to waterborne diseases’ is not
quite accurate. First, the presence of fecal coliform bacteria does not guarantee that there is a
sewage source because fecal coliform bacteria are present in a variety of natural environments.
Second, the presence of fecal coliforms does not guarantee the presence of pathogens or
waterborne disease. The authors may want to change the language to indicate an increased
potential for pathogens.
The model results are surprisingly good! Some models had an R2 of 0.76, which is much higher
than I would anticipate.
3
The input of EC from another location (see lines 423-424) increased the explanation of variation in
the model, but this does not improve timeliness of results because it still requires bacteria
culturing. This should be noted.
The influence of season on the Saco River watershed is notable. Do the authors have any
comments on the overwhelming importance of this in the model?
‘model skill’ (line 570) should be changed to ‘model outcome’
The figures are wonderfully descriptive. If required to reduce the number of figures or move
them to supplemental material, I would recommend doing so for figures 8 & 9
The figures that include water quality stations for the Kennebec and Androscoggin are difficult to
interpret, given the complex landform. Is there a way to improve these, visually?

Response to Reviewers:
Reviewer #1
In a few instances, correlation and causation are intermingled. For example, in the abstract, it
is stated that several parameters “have significant effects on water quality.” Also, in the
introduction, it is stated that physical mechanisms “may be responsible for reduced water
quality.” The ultimate cause of reduced water quality is the sewage input; coastal processes
merely concentrate or disperse the contaminant.
We have modified the text to reflect that the physical mechanisms are transporting the water
containing the contaminants and the parameters examined in our study are correlated with
variations in water quality.
“Analysis of a higher frequency, two-year study using multiple linear regression models
revealed that precipitation, salinity, river discharge, winds, seasonality, and coastal
circulation correlate with variations in water quality.” – lines 40-42
“In addition to precipitation and river discharge, other physical mechanisms may be
responsible for the concentration or dispersal of pathogens in estuaries and the coastal
ocean [20, 21].” – lines 77-79
There are a few instances of questionable language. In the introduction (line 90-91), the
language “resulting in unsafe water conditions” might be changed instead to “resulting in
exposure to contaminated water”. ‘Unsafe’ doesn’t fully describe the condition here.
We have modified the text to remove the questionable language and more accurately
describe water quality and water conditions.
“Water quality may change during that time period [33], which could lead to inaccurate
water quality advisories resulting in exposure to pathogens in the water or unnecessary
closures.” – lines 96-98
The introduction paragraph starting on line 87 is quite a mishmash of information; consider
reorganizing or splitting.
We have split the paragraph into three separate paragraphs and reorganized the
information to be clearer to the reader.
“The threats to human health from pathogens have increased [10, 34]. Reductions in
water quality after high precipitation events and the subsequent increases in river
discharge have led local authorities to close beaches and shellfish beds after large
events in coastal Maine [e.g. 35, 36] and other locations throughout north America
[37, 38, 39]. The inability of local authorities to accurately predict these events or to
immediately assess the water quality exacerbates the losses to fishing and tourist
economies in these regions [37, 38, 39].
The need for accurate and timely predictions of water quality in the United States has
become acute [11]. However, the testing for the presence of fecal bacteria is labor
intensive and generally requires an 18-24 hr. period for sample incubation. Water
quality may change during that time period [33], which could lead to inaccurate water
quality advisories resulting in exposure to pathogens in the water or unnecessary
closures.
The reliance on a single parameter for the prediction of water quality can be
problematic, requiring more complex, predictive models. Sampson et al. [40] found no
relation between rainfall events and fecal bacteria at Lake Superior recreational
beaches. Studies have examined various inputs on water quality using partial least
squares regression models [42], artificial neural networks [4], and multiple linear
regression models [3, 43]. Although there has been extensive development of
predictive models for freshwater [e.g. 3, 43, 44], applications to marine waters
have been limited [e.g. 4, 42, 45]. “ – lines 87-106
The description of the statistical models needs some clarity. In the decision model, were only
high discharge/high fecal coliforms selected?
We examined the effect of both high discharge and high precipitation events on high fecal
coliforms. We have modified the text to make this clearer to the reader.
“The relationships between water quality and the hydrometeorological parameters of
the region were examined by (1) a decision model that linked high river discharge
events with Reduced Water Quality Events (RWQEs) during Study I, (2) a decision model
that linked high precipitation events with RWQEs during Study I…” - lines 227-230
“The decision models allowed us to test the hypotheses that a RWQE (defined as the
time when fecal coliforms within a sample exceeded 14 colonies /100mL, which is the
maximum allowable value for shellfish growing areas for the state of Maine [52]) occurs
within a set period of time after a high discharge event or after a high precipitation
event within the watershed. “ – lines 242-246
On line 255, the wording ‘resulting in no unnecessary exposure to waterborne diseases’ is
not quite accurate. First, the presence of fecal coliform bacteria does not guarantee that there
is a sewage source because fecal coliform bacteria are present in a variety of natural
environments. Second, the presence of fecal coliforms does not guarantee the presence of
pathogens or waterborne disease. The authors may want to change the language to indicate
an increased potential for pathogens.
We have modified the text to remove the inaccurate language and more accurately describe
the use of the model to examine the presence of fecal coliform bacteria and the potential
presence of waterborne pathogens.
“A perfect model would predict all RWQEs, resulting in no exposure to fecal coliforms
and potential pathogens (or Type II errors [53]), and produce no false alarms or
unnecessary closures of the region. “ – lines 255-257
The model results are surprisingly good! Some models had an R2 of 0.76, which is much
higher than I would anticipate.
The model results are good! However, the high correlations are not unprecedented. We
have compared these values to other studies and found that they are consistent with previous
examinations of other mechanistic water quality models.
“Several studies of beaches on Lake Michigan [3, 20, 43] found correlation values
between their various models and E. coli concentrations that ranged from 0.56 to
0.84.” – lines 587-589
The input of EC from another location (see lines 423-424) increased the explanation of
variation in the model, but this does not improve timeliness of results because it still requires
bacteria culturing. This should be noted.
Agreed. We have added text to reflect the limitations of the model.
“Although the inclusion of total coliform and E. coli concentrations from upstream
increased the ability of the model to explain the variance of downstream stations, it
would not improve the immediate utility of this particular model since acquiring
this information still requires culturing bacteria. However, because the ultimate
source of fecal contamination at Saco is largely point-source discharge from
combined sewer overflows, empirical measurement of indicator bacteria at this
location might be replaced with another regression model that predicted
discharges as a function of recent and historical precipitation.” – lines 606-613
The influence of season on the Saco River watershed is notable. Do the authors have any
comments on the overwhelming importance of this in the model?
We have added text to better describe possible reasons for the strong influence of season on
the water quality in the region.
“The strong seasonal signals of the E. coli and total coliform concentrations within the
Saco River and near the mouth of the Scarborough River are consistent with temporal
variations in the population of the area. The lag times for the seasonal signal (Eqn. 2)
range from 171 to 269 days (Tables 4 & 5), resulting in peak values for the seasonal
signal that range from June 21 to September 27, which encompass the summer season
when the population of southern Maine increases due to an influx of tourists (and the
associated sewage outflow is greatest). “ – lines 523-529
‘model skill’ (line 570) should be changed to ‘model outcome’
Done.
The figures that include water quality stations for the Kennebec and Androscoggin are
difficult to interpret, given the complex landform. Is there a way to improve these, visually?
Unfortunately, our attempts at modifying the figures have not resulted in clarity. We are
confident that the figures are able to represent the information required [although we do
agree that the figures can be somewhat difficult to interpret].
