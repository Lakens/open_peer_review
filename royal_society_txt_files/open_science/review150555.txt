This paper presents a short review of the various component of the extragalactic background.
Each component is discussed briefly in a 1-2 page section without any real novelty. Many reviews
were written focusing in depth on one or two of these backgrounds (including one including the
author, Casey et al. 2014). Having a short summary of the full EBL could be useful. However, the
current structure is a long catalog of results without key points. This is not particularly well
written and often confusing even for a specialist. Globally, this review aims at dealing with too
many topics and treats none of them correctly. The discussion alternates between absolute
brightness and anisotropies without real transition. This might have been useful to separate these
two types of measurements in different subsection. Some parts of the text lack of references,
while others are overabundant.
Finally, the Fig. 1, which summarizes the results of hundreds of observational papers, does not
cite any reference. I think that such type of figures should be published associated with a table
summarizing all the measurements used in the plot (see, e.g., Hauser&Dwek 2011).
I cannot thus recommend the publication of this manuscript at the current stage.
Since the manuscript will probably evolve a lot. I only listed my main comments below:
Introduction: There is no connection between paragraphs. This is a long list of general statements
with very few references to justify them.
Gamma-ray:
The new Fermi paper (arXiv:1511.0693) claims that the background at E>50GeV can be explained
by blazars. This should be included.
Camera et al. 2013 is presented as a measurement, but this is in fact just a theoretical paper.
UV:
The author proposes to observe the background between 10 and 100 nm. However, Universe is
not transparent at this wavelength, because these wavelengths are very efficiently absorbed by
hydrogen. So, this is probing only a limited horizon. This should be at least discussed.
CIB:
CIB absolute measurements are not limited by the sensitivity, but mainly by the problem of the
subtraction of the foregrounds.
CMB:
Should really the CMB be reviewed in one page? This was done already many times and much
better. Maybe this review should only discuss how CMB can be used in combination with other
backgrounds.
Radio:
This is totally confusing. First, the ARCADE2 excess cannot be explained by known-source and
could be caused by decaying DM, and two lines later this is a problem of foreground. I am
surprised the authors do not cite the work of Vernstrom et al.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The manuscripts provides a comprehensive review of the "universal" or "intergalactic" photon
backgrounds across electromagnetic spectrum, in a review-style form. The information given for
each energy band appears correct for me and is presented in a rather exhaustive form with a fair
judgement of uncertainties.
My main concern is that I am not sure what did the authors wanted to present. To be more
precise: does Fig. 1 present the energy flux crossing a square meter detector placed in the middle
of nowhere (intergalactic space), or this is the "background unresolved in telescopes"? I guess that
the first possibility is what the authors describe. If this is so, the cumulative flux of detected
extragalactic point sources should be added to the gamma-ray background measurement in the
gamma-ray band and it should be specified how it is done.
In Fig. 1, I am not sure what does the "bifurcation" of the data points in the gamma-ray range
mean. Perhaps the upper points are EGRET, they should be removed, because they are affected
by systematics and an incomplete subtraction of the Galactic signal.
The X-ray spectrum could perhaps smoothly join into the gamma-ray, by adding the COMPTEL
measurements, which could at least be shown as upper limits (because of the uncertainty of
Galactic contribution).
There is a miss-spell CAT -> CTA in he last paragraph of section "(a) Gamma ray"
Otherwise, the text provides a useful summary of our knowledge of the backgrounds and could
be published.

Comments to the Author:
The subject matter of the manuscript has been deemed to be suitable for RSOS. However, the
reviews identify the need for more complete referencing of the supporting observations used in
the various figures and the need to expand the description/details in parts of the case.

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-150555)
Dear Ian/Rob (through Matthew)
I am submiting a revised manuscript of the review related to extragalactic background light
based on the comments from the two reviewers.
I have done my best to address concerns expressed by the reviewers and have updated parts of
the text as necessary. I have also updated Figure 1
and explain those updates in my reply to the reviewers below.
I think the comments were mostly minor, but I gather the conflict between the two reviewers. I
suppose this is natural.
Reviewer 1 suggested that I include a detailed table (similar to Hauser & Dwek 2011 ARAA
review on optical and infrared backgrounds).
I don't think this is necessary. Instead I am happy to make available all electronic files, in an easy
to use format
with a README or comment file identifying the origin (instrument/experiment and the paper
reference), used to generate Figure 1.
Data in Figure 2 are mostly covered in the Hauser & Dwek table, apart from a few new
measurements since 2011 or so.
I will include those as well. Please let me know if this is acceptable.

Reply to reviewer 1
We thank the reviewer for detailed comments on my review related to the extragalactic
background light. While I agree with the reviewer,
and understand the reviewer's concerns on the treatment of many topics with limited details,
there is also no review that attempts to
bring the whole electromagnetic spectrum to a single article. It is true that each of the regimes
(gamma-rays, X-rays etc) can be
covered easily by 200-300 page Physics Reports type review articles, the attempt here is not to
write a lengthy book, but rather
point out some of the key aspects while providing the best and recent references for those topics.
I think reviewer 2 understood the nature
of such an article given those comments. As an example why a short review such as the one I
completed in necessary I am happy to
point out figure 1 remains the best representation of our knowledge related to the extragalactic
backgtound light over
whole of the electromagnetic spectrum. Prior to this the best figure on this is from a conference
proceedings article by Douglas Scott in
2007 (can be seen at https://www.rit.edu/science/sites/rit.edu.science/files/u7/fig1_19.jpg).
In any case given the reviewer's concerns I have revised parts of the text throughout the article
and have done my best to
always include references to more detailed reviewers on sciences and measurements at each of
those wavelengths.
some comments:
>Finally, the Fig. 1, which summarizes the results of hundreds of observational papers, does not

While I agree with the reviewer, I do not think a printed table is necesaary here. Instead, I am
making public availble all electronic files that
were put together for Figure 1 in easy to use electronic ascii table forms listing wavelength,
measurement, y+ and y- errors in the used unit in Figure 1
with appropriate readme and reference files. I am happy to make such data avilable in some data
repository (though I am hesitant since
I technically did not obtain the actual data myself but rather come from published literature), but
will definitely make them available
from my group's website (where we have released multiple datasets over the years, including
those that were used for several Nature
papers by my group). I'll have these files online to meet the publication of the paper.

I have improved text around here to clarify. I also motivate MeV measurements, based on
reviewer 2 comments as addressed below.

Certainly, noted.

Made clear.

I have followed this and emphasized more the cross studies between wavelengths and have
included references to some recent reviews on CMB theory
and measurements. Unfortnately, there is no review of the status of CMB field in general since
Planck.

>This is totally confusing. First, the ARCADE2 excess cannot be explained by known-source and

I have changed description and added Vernstrom et al.
Reviewer: 2
I thank the reviewer for helpful comments. Some replies below.

It is definitely the extragalactic background, as described by the first possibility. I realized
previous version of figure 1 only included
the 2010 estimate of the gamma-ray background from Fermi-LAT where as the newer
measurements from Ackerman+ 2015 includes an accounting of the
detected sources + diffuse background, with improved modeling of the Galactic foreground. I
10
have added those (plus a few new others) to figure 1.
I believe Figure 1 is now the best representation of our knowledge related to the extragalactic
background light (as seen middle of nowhere)
over the whole of the EM spectrum. It updates the last version of such a figure I have seen from a
conference proceeding in 2007
(see my reply to reviewer 1 above).

Reviewer is correct on that one. I have removed the three highest energy points from EGRET. I
have also added COMPTEL (those have fractionally large error bars).
The new text motives an improvement to MeV scale EBL.
>There is a miss-spell CAT -> CTA in he last paragraph of section "(a) Gamma ray"
corrected.
>Otherwise, the text provides a useful summary of our knowledge of the backgrounds and could

thanks again for the comments.
