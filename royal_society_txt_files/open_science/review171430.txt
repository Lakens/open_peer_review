In this work, CdSe nanorods were synthesized, and their structural and optical properties were
studied. The morphology of the nanorods were characterized by XRD, SEM and TEM, and the
growth orientation was determined to be (0002). The orientation preference was explained by
DFT calculations in terms of surface energy. In addition, blue shift in PL and absorption spectrum
with respect to bulk was observed. For the study of structural properties, the experimental and
computational data are in consistent with the conclusions. However, there is one important issue
regarding the optical property study. According to the reported PL and absorption spectrum, the
optical band gap of the nanorods is around 2.3 eV. The blue shift of 0.6 eV compared with bulk is
quite large. According to Fig. 5 and 6, the width and length of the nanorods are several hundred
nm. At this size, quantum confinement effect is very weak, and cannot explain the large blue
shift. For example, in a previous work [Nano Letters, 2001, 1, 349–351], the optical gap of a CdSe
nanorod with a length of 17.6 nm and a width of 6.4 nm was reported to be 1.93 eV. The nanorods
in the present work are much larger than that, so one would expect a gap smaller than 1.93 eV.
Instead, a large gap of 2.3 eV was found here. An explanation for this unusual blue shift must be
provided. I think the work can potentially be publishable in Royal Society Open Science with a
revision including this explanation.

The article submitted by Rajan et al. describes a study on the investigation of CdSe nanorods
synthesized by henna leaves. Their study, as stated in the conclusions section, is devoted on the
structural, electronic and bonding effects of hexagonal CdSe nanorods. However, my feeling is
that the message and the concept of the study is not clearly provided and it is difficult to be
understood by the reader.
For example, bonding and electronic effects are not clearly provided. Why CdSe nanorods.
Although the authors state that:"The current research paper focuses on the green extract
mediated synthesis of CdSe nanocrystals (NCs) in the form of nanorods", the <<importance>> of
CdSe nanorods to the concept of the study is not
revealed.
I would recommend the authors to reformulate their draft in a concise way where the message of
the reported study is clearly transferred to the reader.

Reviewer: 1#
ar Reviewers,
have read the comments very carefully and revised the manuscript (Revision is in yellow
t) as per the reviewer’s request. We are very grateful for the reviewer’s contribution to
rove the quality of this work. We are also appreciative of your time for helping us on our
lications.
estion 1.
this work, CdSe nanorods were synthesized, and their structural and optical properties
re studied. The morphology of the nanorods were characterized by XRD, SEM and
M, and the growth orientation was determined to be (0002). The orientation preference
s explained by DFT calculations in terms of surface energy. In addition, blue shift in PL
absorption spectrum with respect to bulk was observed. For the study of structural
perties, the experimental and computational data are in consistent with the conclusions.
wever, there is one important issue regarding the optical property study. According to
reported PL and absorption spectrum, the optical band gap of the nanorods is around
eV. The blue shift of 0.6 eV compared with bulk is quite large. According to Fig. 5 and
2
he width and length of the nanorods are several hundred nm. At this size, quantum
finement effect is very weak, and cannot explain the large blue shift. For example, in a
vious work [Nano Letters, 2001, 1, 349–351], the optical gap of a CdSe nanorod with a
gth of 17.6 nm and a width of 6.4 nm was reported to be 1.93 eV. The nanorods in the
sent work are much larger than that, so one would expect a gap smaller than 1.93 eV.
tead, a large gap of 2.3 eV was found here. An explanation for this unusual blue shift
st be provided. I think the work can potentially be publishable in Royal Society Open
ence with a revision including this explanation.
ponse to the reviewer:
authors thank the reviewer for a valid point in improving the quality of manuscript. We
rred the paper suggested by the reviewer as well as other relevant literature, we also reviewed
data analysis and the response for this question is given below and also highlighted in the
nuscript.
“The visible absorption spectrum of the synthesized CdSe nanorods recorded at room
perature was displayed in figure 4. In the visible absorption spectrum of CdSe nanorods,
re are broad peaks in the UV curve, which are centred at 514, 521 and 530 nm. The
orption shoulder at 530 nm has an absorption band edge at 540 nm. The calculated optical
d gap with respect to this absorption edge (540 nm) is 2.3 eV. Therefore, the results indicated
ue shift of 0.6 eV for CdSe nanorods relative to the bulk CdSe band gap of 1.7 eV at 730 nm
,21]. Surprisingly, we observed that this is an unusual blue shift still existing in the
thesized nanorods even the size of the grown nanorods is comparatively larger in dimensions
n the previously reported work [22]. Therefore, we suspect that the obtained blue shifted band
3
is not due to the quantum confinement effects rather than it could be due to the preferable
ntation growth effects.
As CdSe nanorods are grown larger along surface, the surface roughness
reases from the centre of the nanorod to its edge with an increase in the sharpness at the tip
ion. In such a more rough surface, the exact width of the nanorods is quiet difficult to
asure and still we measured the average diameter of the nanorods as seen in HR-TEM graph
ure 3). Therefore, the excitation peak does not depend on the long axis which grows beyond
confinement regime but depends only on the short axis on the rods which could be a
usible reason for the blue shifting of the excitation peak. In the present case, the nanorod size
ribution relatively varies with each other due to differences in their individual growth. In
h cases, the optical-band gap measurements cannot be an evidence for the quantum
finement effects in nanostructures. As evident from the figure 4, the synthesized CdSe
orods exhibit relatively larger intensity of absorption at the visible region of electromagnetic
ctrum, which can be accountable to the strong scattering in this region. Due to this scattering
ct, the optical path tends to increase and the stronger absorption will result in higher incident
ton-to-electron conversion efficiency for the operation of photovoltaic solar cells [7, 23,24].
Figure 5 displays the photoluminescence emission spectrum of the synthesized CdSe
orods recorded with an excitation wavelength of 480 nm. Two emission maximum peaks
e observed at 520 and 537 nm. The peaks are strong with narrow band edge emission in the
ble region of electromagnetic spectrum. Also, the emission of surface is visible with major
mps in the spectrum reveals the existence of larger surface area.”
