Referee’s Report on RSOS-181101
“Pressure generated at the instant of impact between a liquid droplet and solid surface”
by Tatekura et al.
The manuscript contains interesting work, but the following points have to be addressed before I could
make a positive recommendation.
(1) Under what circumstances is an expression of the form given in equation (1) valid? There are
certainly many situations in which it wouldn’t be appropriate! The authors must include an
adequate explanation of this important point in their manuscript.
(2) The authors need to relate their work (or explain why it is not related) to the body of work on
pressure impulse theory (see, for example, Cooker and Peregrine J Fluid Mech 1995 and
Philippi et al. Euro J Fluid Mech – B/ Fluids 2018).
(3) The authors also need to explain the relation of their contribution to the large body of classical
work on fluid-solid impact (see, for example, Howison et al. J Fluid Mech 1991).
(4) Surely, in practice, the presence of air between the liquid droplet and the solid surface must
play a significant role (see, for example, Wilson J Eng Math 1991 and Hicks and Purvis Phys
Fluids 2011)?

We would like to show our gratitude for reviewing our manuscript. We have carefully revised the manuscript
ccording to the comments of Referee 1 to the best of our ability. We have responded specifically to each
omments as follows.
omment 1
Under what circumstances is an expression of the form given in equation (1) valid? There are certainly
any situations in which it wouldn’t be appropriate! The authors must include an adequate explanation of this
mportant point in their manuscript.
esponse to Comment 1
We totally agree with the comment of Referee 1 that we should clearly state the conditions where an ex-
ression of the form given in equation (5.1) is valid. In order to discuss the validity of our study, we consider
oth governing equations and boundary conditions.
. Governing equations
First, we consider the governing equations. We conducted our study greatly inspired by Engel [1], Heymann
], and Lesser [3]. Now, we investigate the conditions under which they conducted their studies. Engel [1]
ated the following in Section 3 of her paper, where she derived an equation for the impact pressure resulting
om waterdrop-to-solid collisions:
From the results of the experimental work, which have been discussed in section 2, it seems reasonable
to think that a treatment similar to that of the elastic impact of solid may provide a reliable estimate
of the impact pressure. However, the spherical shape of the water drop, which imposes the condition
that compressional waves initiated in it by the collision are not all started simultaneously, must be
taken into account.
hen, she began her analysis by assuming that the first effect of the collision is the initiation of a compressional
ave that starts to spread through the water sphere.
Heymann [2] began his study by stating:
The most frequently used approximations to the pressure developed in liquid-solid impact are based
on one-dimensional “water–hammer” or elastic impact theory. When the solid surface can be as-
sumed rigid, this results in
P = <U+03C1> 0 c0 V (1)
where <U+03C1>0 and c0 are the density and acoustic velocity of the undisturbed liquid and V is the impact
velocity. This well-known expression can easily be derived from momentum considerations, if one
asssumes that upon impact a plane pressure or shock wave of magnitude P propagates into the
impinging liquid body at a relative velocity c0 , progressively bringing to rest each liquid “layer” as
it passes through.
e found that both Engel and Heymann implemented elastic impact theory, or “water–hammer theory” to
nalyze the pressure developed in liquid-solid impact without in-depth discussion. We understand that imple-
entation of elastic impact theory to analyze the pressure developed in liquid-solid impact has already been
idely accepted because their works are seminal in studies of liquid-solid impact pressure development.
Lesser [3] investigated analytic solution of liquid-drop impact problems in the acoustic limit were the approx-
mation that the velocity jump due to impact, V is significantly less that the speed of sound of liquid c0 : V  c0
olds. Lesser stated that it is well known fact that in the acoustic limit the jump in pressure is related to the
mp in velocity across an acoustic discontinuity or shock by the so-called ‘water-hammer’ relation. Therefore,
e can use elastic theory, or “water–hammer” theory, even in the case where the impact velocity is much lower
an the speed of sound of liquid.
However, Philippi et al.[4], who used pressure impulse theory to study drop impact on a slid surface, stated
follows:
The following discussion will therefore be limited to those cases where the impact velocity is much
lower than the speed of sound, as the falling raindrop, where acoustic effects can harmlessly be
neglected and an incompressible description remains accurate.
te that pressure impulse theory can be applicable to only incompressible fluid flow; hence, the solution
ained from pressure impulse theory cannot take the compressibility of liquid into consideration. Now we
e to answer the question: Can elastic theory, or “water–hammer” theory, be applicable to analyze the pressure
eloped in liquid-solid impact in the case where the impact velocity is much lower than the speed of sound of
id? In order to discuss this issue, we consider the model proposed by Lesser [3]. In Supplement S2 of our
dy, we introduced the Huyghens principle that can well predict the profile of the compressed wavefront as
wn by Lesser[3]:
By the Huyghens principle, at each instant the extending contact line will emit a wavelet moving at
the compression wavefront speed s [1]. The envelope of the individual wavelets forms a compression
wave front separating a disturbed liquid region from an undisturbed liquid region. The envelope
of these wavelets consists a compression wavefront Lesser derived the critical time tc when the
expanding speed of the contact line is equal to the compression wavefront speed s. When t < tc ,
compression wavefront cannot overtake the contact line, but is pinned at the contact line. The
geometrical acoustics model proposed by Lesser [1] enabled us to evaluate tc , which can be defined
as
tc = Mi R/(2s), (2)
and cr0 , which is the horizontal coordinated of the contact line when the expanding speed of the
contact line is equal to s:
cr0 = Mi R. (3)
our study, we are interested in the pressure generated at the instant of impact between a liquid droplet and
id surface; hence the characteristic time, or duration time <U+2206>t, should be much less than tc . Korobkin [5]
cussed the stage of the impact process when 0 < <U+2206>t < tc as follows:
This stage of the impact process may be called supersonic. Its presence is connected with the fact
that the expansion velocity of the contact spot for small times is greater than the local sound velocity.
This result follows from purely geometrical considerations
our study of pressure generated at the instant of impact, we took the limit of the duration <U+2206>t to 0, i.e.,
supersonic stage. Therefore, we consider that the liquid compressibility is essential in the prediction of the
ssure generated at the instant of impact.
Field [6] explained liquid impact theory:
Liquid impact consists of two main stages; initially, the liquid behaves in a compressible manner
generating the so-called “water-hammer” pressure. These high pressures are responsible for most
of the damage resulting from liquid impact and are maintained while the edge of the contact area
between the impacting liquid and the solid moves supersonically with respect to the shock speed.
en, he continues:
The high pressures are generated over a radius of contact given by
R = rV /c0 ,
where r is the radius of curbature of the drop in the region of contact. Pressure release commences
after a time of
3rV
t= .
2c20
The release waves reach the central axis and terminate the high-pressure stage after a time
3rV
t0 =
2c20
Once incompressible stream line flow is established, the pressure on the central axis falls to the much
lower Bernoulli stagnation pressure
<U+03C1>V 2
Pi = .
2
urthermore, in our study, we took the limit of the duration <U+2206>t to 0; hence, viscous boundary layer development
an be negligible. Therefore, we are convinced that elastic theory, or “water–hammer theory”, should be
mplemented in the analysis of pressure generated at the instant of impact between a liquid droplet and solid
urface. However, we carried out numerical simulation of neither low impact velocity case nor viscous fluid
ase; hence, this has not been proven yet. Therefore we refrain from include the in-depth discussion of the
pplicability of elastic theory, or “water–hammer theory”, in our manuscript. Instead, we follow the classical
aper of Engel [1] by implementing elastic theory, or “water–hammer theory” without in-depth discussion
ecause our objective is to discuss the role of the spherical shape factor introduced by Engel by comparing our
sult with Engel’s result. We are still convinced that implementation of elastic impact theory to analyze the
ressure developed in liquid-solid impact has already been widely accepted.
In order to clarify the type of the governing equations, we added the following sentence in the last paragraph
f Introduction:
We numerically estimate the central impact pressure (defined here as the pressure developed at the
instant of the impact on the contact point on the axis of symmetry) by solving two-dimensional
axisymmetric compressible Euler equations.
. Boundary conditions
As Referee 1 pointed out in Comment 4, the presence of air between the liquid droplet and the solid surface
ay play a significant role; indeed the gas layer may deform the shape of the liquid droplet surface, as Wilson
] and Hicks and Purvis [8], whom Referee 1 recommended us to refer, analytically studied, and van der
een, et al [9] experimentally studied. The gas layer may also reduce the impact speed of the liquid droplet
urface. However, we cannot obtain from these studies enough information on either surface shape deformation
r impact speed reduction at the instant of the impact to study the pressure generated at the instant of the
mpact. We would rather like to concentrate on the question: ”How large is the pressure developed at the instant
f a spherical liquid droplet impact on a solid surface?”, which we consider is an unsolved problem of classical
uid mechanics. Therefore, we consider the impact of a spherical liquid droplet on a solid surface under the
ssumption that liquid droplet keeps its spherical shape at the instant of the impact. We rewrote the last
aragraph of Introduction as follows:
To answer this question, we consider the impact of a spherical liquid droplet on a solid surface
under the assumption that liquid droplet keeps its spherical shape at the instant of the impact,
although it is well known that a liquid droplet impacting on a solid surface deforms before the liquid
droplet makes contact with the surface [30,31], or entraps a small air bubble under its center under
atmospheric conditions [32,33]. The reason is that we primarily discuss the role of the spherical
shape factor introduced by Engel [6], who also used the assumption that that liquid droplet keeps
its spherical shape at the instant of the impact, in the central impact pressure rise. We numerically
estimate the central impact pressure (defined here as the pressure developed at the instant of the
impact on the contact point on the axis of symmetry) by solving two-dimensional axisymmetric
compressible Euler equations. We then extend Engel’s elastic impact model [6] taking the limit of
the time from impact for the pressure to reach its maximum to 0, by realizing that the progression
speed of the contact between the gas–liquid interface and the solid surface is extremely faster than
the compression wavefront propagation speed at the instant of the impact. We correct Engel’s elastic
impact model to find that the factor aE /2 appearing in Eq. (1.1) converges to 1 at the instant of
the impact.

The authors need to relate their work (or explain why it is not related) to the body of work on pressure
pulse theory (see, for example, Cooker and Peregrine J Fluid Mech 1995 and Philippi et al. Euro J Fluid
ech - B/Fluids 2018).
esponse to Comment 2
We began our manuscript by presenting the estimated maximum pressure rise <U+2206>PE from the atmosphere
eveloped after a spherical liquid drop impact on a solid surface proposed by Engel as
1
<U+2206>PE = aE <U+03C1>0 c0 V, (1.1)
2
here the speed of sound c0 does show itself as the most significant physical property in the present study. In
her words, the compressibility of the liquid plays the most significant role in the prediction of the maximum
ressure rise. However, pressure impulse theory, which Cooker and Peregrine [1] and Philippi et al. [2] used,
n be applicable to only incompressible fluid flow [3]. Indeed, Philippi et al.[2], who used pressure impulse
eory to study drop impact on a slid surface, clearly stated as follows:
The following discussion will therefore be limited to those cases where the impact velocity is much
lower than the speed of sound, as the falling raindrop, where acoustic effects can harmlessly be
neglected and an incompressible description remains accurate.
We are convinced that the most general methods to investigate the pressure generated at the instant of
pact between a liquid droplet and solid surface are those that appropriately take the liquid compressibility
to consideration. These studies use elastic theory, or water-hammer theory. Indeed, we selected references
at take the liquid compressibility into consideration and use these theories. We are afraid that the readers
ay misunderstand that we consider that the liquid compressibility is not important if we relate our work to
e studies on pressure impulse theory that is valid only in the incompressible limit.
Furthermore, one of the referees had required us to abridge the introduction during the review process of
is manuscript; hence, we had already compressed the introduction by deleting less significant description to
te the necessary and sufficient references. Therefore, we decided to avoid referring those studies recommended
y Referee 1.

The authors also need to explain the relation of their contribution to the large body of classical work on
uid-solid impact (see, for example, Howison et al. J Fluid Mech 1991).
esponse to Comment 3
We intended to concentrate on the question: ”How large is the pressure developed at the instant (t=0) of a
pherical liquid droplet impact on a solid surface?” We quantitatively evaluated the magnitude of the pressure
t a point impact, i.e. at a liquid droplet with a finite curvature impact on a solid rigid plain surface at the
stant (t=0) of impact, in order to clarify the shape factor proposed by Engel.
In the studies of solid body impact on a liquid surface (reviewed by, for example, Korobkin and Pukhachav
], and Howison et al. [2]), the free surface is a plain, where no shape factor should be considered; hence,
ur problem and their problem are qualitatively different. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, most
f classical work on fluid-solid impact, including the seminal paper by Wagner [3], Howison et al. [2], and
calan and Korobkin [4], are carried out under the assumption of an ideal and incompressible liquid. As we
ave explained in Response to Comment 2, we are convinced that the most general methods to investigate the
ressure generated at the instant of impact between a liquid droplet and solid surface are those that appropriately
ake the liquid compressibility into consideration. We are afraid that the readers may misunderstand that we
onsider that the liquid compressibility is not important if we relate our work to the studies carried out under
he assumption of the incompressible liquid.
Furthermore, one of the referees had required us to abridge the introduction during the review process of
his manuscript; hence, we had already compressed the introduction by deleting less significant description to
te the necessary and sufficient references. Therefore, we decided to avoid referring those studies recommended
y Referee 1.
However, we would like Referee 1 to understand that we referred important paper of blunt-body impact on
compressible liquid surface by Korobkin [5,6] in our manuscript. We selected his paper from the large body
f classical work on fluid-solid impact because he took the liquid compressibility into consideration. We think
hat the reference of the work by Korobkin in our manuscript may explain, to some extent, the relation to the
ork on fluid-solid impact.

Surely, in practice, the presence of air between the liquid droplet and the solid surface must play a significant
ole (see, for example, Wilson J Eng Math 1991 and Hicks and Purvis Phys Fluids 2011)?
esponse to Comment 4
The presence of air between the liquid droplet and the solid surface may play a significant role in the pressure
enerated at the instant of the impact as Referee 1 pointed out. We consider that two contributions of the gas
yer are more important than others; the gas layer may either deform the shape of the liquid droplet surface
r reduce the impact speed of the liquid droplet surface, or both.
Referee 1 recommended us to refer Wilson [4] and Hicks and Purvis [5]. Wilson [4] studied a mathematical
odel for the initial stages of the impact of a rigid body onto a fluid in the presence of a cushioning fluid layer.
we have explained in Response to Comment 3, the problem of the impact of a rigid body onto a fluid is
tally different from the problem of the impact of a liquid droplet onto a rigid solid surface. Therefore we
sider that the study by Wilson is hardly relevant to our study. On the other hand, Hicks and Puvis [6]
uss the compressibility effects in the gas the air cushioning in deformable liquid droplet impact, although
y consider the droplet impact with liquid and other droplet. They found that the compressibility effects
uld be taken into account when the droplet velocity is greater than 5 m/s. We decided to add Hicks and
vis to our reference. However, we cannot obtain from these studies enough information on either surface
pe deformation or impact speed reduction at the instant of the impact to study the pressure generated at
instant of the impact.
van der Veen, et al [3.] accurately measured the air layer profile and quantitatively studied the impact
amics at at short time scale before impact, although the impact speed of their experiment was very low
2 m/s). The striking result of theirs is that the air layer profile was asymmetric at the instant of the impact.
he impact, the liquid and solid surfaces are in contact not at a ring but a point. Therefore, we consider that
axisymmetric analysis may not sufficient to investigate the pressure generated at the instant of the impact
quid droplet; hence, it is extremely hard to investigate the role of the gas layer in the pressure generate at
instant of the impact at the final stage of the gas layer thinning process.
It should be noted that the contribution of the gas layer may not always be significant when a liquid
plet impacts on a solid surface. For example, in the steam-pipe erosion, or ultra-cleaning technology, where
rometer size droplets impact on a solid surface with several ten to hundred meter-per-second speeds in vapor
ronment, the gas layer does not necessarily be formed because of phase change. Furthermore, for the study
rosion in the liquid droplet radiator used for the heat waste of the spacecraft in the space, the pressure
erated at the impact without gas layer is important.
As described above, the contribution of the gas layer may not always be significant when a liquid droplet
acts on a solid surface. We consider that the question: ”How large is the pressure developed at the instant
spherical liquid droplet impact on a solid surface?” is an unsolved problem of classical fluid mechanics. We
nded to concentrate on this question. Therefore, we added the reference that Referee 1 suggested, and we
rote the last paragraph of Introduction as follows:
To answer this question, we consider the impact of a spherical liquid droplet on a solid surface
under the assumption that liquid droplet keeps its spherical shape at the instant of the impact,
although it is well known that a liquid droplet impacting on a solid surface deforms before the liquid
droplet makes contact with the surface [30,31], or entraps a small air bubble under its center under
atmospheric conditions [32,33]. The reason is that we primarily discuss the role of the spherical
shape factor introduced by Engel [6], who also used the assumption that that liquid droplet keeps
its spherical shape at the instant of the impact, in the central impact pressure rise. We numerically
estimate the central impact pressure (defined here as the pressure developed at the instant of the
impact on the contact point on the axis of symmetry) by solving two-dimensional axisymmetric
compressible Euler equations. We then extend Engel’s elastic impact model [6] taking the limit of
the time from impact for the pressure to reach its maximum to 0, by realizing that the progression
speed of the contact between the gas–liquid interface and the solid surface is extremely faster than
the compression wavefront propagation speed at the instant of the impact. We correct Engel’s elastic
impact model to find that the factor aE /2 appearing in Eq. (1.1) converges to 1 at the instant of
the impact.

Y. Tatekura, M. Watanabe, K. Kobayashi, and T. Sanada.
We would like to show our gratitude for reviewing our manuscript. We have carefully revised the manuscript
rding to the comments of Reviewer 1 to the best of our ability. We have responded specifically to each
ments as follows.
mment 1
In relation to my first original point, I would very much like to see considerably more of the (very lengthy
detailed) explanation included in the response to me put into the final version of the manuscript. Other
ers will have the same concern about this as I did, and should therefore be given more explanation than in
current version of the manuscript.
ginal point:
Under what circumstances is an expression of the form given in equation (1) valid? There are
certainly many situations in which it wouldn’t be appropriate! The authors must include an adequate
explanation of this important point in their manuscript.
ponse to Comment 1
We rewrote the last sentence of the conclusion as follows in accordance with the request of Reviewer 1.
We conclude that we successfully proved that the corrected Engel’s theory can also provide the
maximum central pressure rise <U+2206>Ps : Eq. (5.1), at the instant of impact between a spherical liquid
droplet which keeps its spherical shape at the instant of the impact and a rigid solid surface.
mment 2
In relation to my second original point, I suggest adding a single sentence to the manuscript summarising
response the authors gave to me.
ginal point:
The authors need to relate their work (or explain why it is not related) to the body of work on
pressure impulse theory (see, for example, Cooker and Peregrine J Fluid Mech 1995 and Philippi et
al. Euro J Fluid Mech - B/Fluids 2018).
ponse to Comment 2
We added the following paragraph before the last paragraph in Section 1 in accordance with the suggestion
eviewer 1.
Note that pressure impulse theory, which Cooker and Peregrine [30] and Philippi et al. [31] used, and
most of classical work on fluid-solid impact, including the seminal paper by Wagner [32], Howison
et al. [33], and Scolan and Korobkin [34], were carried out under the assumption of an ideal and
incompressible liquid. However, the compressibility of the liquid plays the most significant role
in the prediction of the maximum pressure rise. The most general methods to investigate the
pressure generated at the instant of impact between a liquid droplet and solid surface are those that
appropriately take the liquid compressibility into consideration.
mment 3
In relation to my third original point, I suggest adding a single sentence and one or two key references to
marising the response the authors gave to me.
ginal point:
The authors also need to explain the relation of their contribution to the large body of classical work
on fluid-solid impact (see, for example, Howison et al. J Fluid Mech 1991).
ponse to Comment 3

In relation to my fourth original point, I would still like to see a citation to the early pioneering work by
son (1991) added to the manuscript.

Surely, in practice, the presence of air between the liquid droplet and the solid surface must play a
significant role (see, for example, Wilson J Eng Math 1991 and Hicks and Purvis Phys Fluids 2011)?
