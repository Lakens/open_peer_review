This article (RSOS-180159) titled “Decorating Gold Nanostars with Multiwalled Carbon

the MWCNTs/gold nanostars show prominent photothermal value and may serve as a novel

revisions.

Review of “Decorating Gold Nanostars with Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes for Photothermal
Therapy”.
In this manuscript, the authors reported the preparation and in vitro viability/biocompatibility
characterization of gold nanostars/carbon nanotube hybrids. They tried to demonstrate an
enhanced PPT conversion efficiency and the promising use for improving cancer therapy. To help
improve the scientific depth of their study, I raised several suggestions as below, including
corrections, further clarification, as well as more result supplemental.
1. Abstract: The authors compared the PTT efficiency of their hybrid nanomaterial with other
nanomaterials including nanostar only and nanosphere. Since multiwalled carbon nanotubes
were introduced in their hybrid nanomaterial, and they also have PTT responsibility, please add
the control test result of PPT for carbon nanotubes only.
4
2. Is there a better way to synthesize nanostars with uniform branch numbers and length? Unlike
nanosphere and nanorods which have pretty well-developed methods to control uniform size,
shape, etc., the nanostars shown here are in a distribution of shapes/morphology. As the authors
mentioned in their introduction section, these parameters impact the plasmon property. If the
resultant products are not pure in nanomaterials with a defined shape/morphology, it would be
very difficult to apply. Thus, I am not sure if nanostar is a good candidate than other
nanoparticles.
3. Hydrogen bromide (HBr) was mentioned in the reagents section, while I did not see its use in
the preparation steps.
4. What is the function of nanotubes in the nucleation and growth of nanostars?
5. Section 4.2: where is the MWCNTs/gold nanostars-PEG solution from? If PEG is not
mentioned in the reagents section, why should the authors show it in the results? The same for
“gold bipyramid”.
6. Section 4.2: When comparing the light-to-heat conversion of nanostars with other
nanoparticles, what parameter was kept constant, nanoparticle concentration or atom
concentration?
7. Section 4.3: the same as before, please clerify which concentration you used, atom or
nanoparticle?
8. Figure 4b: the authors are suggested to dig deeper the mechanism behind their PPT results.
What happened exactly when nanoparticles combined with cells, and irradiated by NIR? Did the
nanoparticle enter the cells? Or just generating heat in the outside solution? The current results
could not differentiate. One recommended test is to heat the cell solution to the same elevated
temperature as that when using nanomaterials, and compare their cell viability. If the results
show similar death, then it is quite possible that the heat is generated outside cells, and vice
versa.
9. Figure 5b: please explain what the AO/BE intensities represent.
10. Figure 5b and 6: I did not a significant difference in cell viability between nanostars only and
nanotube/nanostar hybrids.

label_comment_4
The hybrid MWCNTs/gold nanostars material was prepared without requiring any surfactant,
and importantly the material exhibited dramatically improved photothermal conversion
efficiency and cancer cells ablation over gold nanostars alone and the more conventionally used
gold nanospheres. The research is very useful and the content of this work is abundant. In my
opinion, the manuscript could be considered for publication after minor revisions. Other
comments are given below:
Question 1:
Did the purchased MWCNTs need to be preprocessed, shorten or carboxylation?
Question 2:
MWCNTs was very long (5–15 µm), how did MWCNTs act on cells, adsorb on cell surface or
pass through cells?
Question 3:
Did MWCNTs/gold nanostars act on all kinds of cells (including normal cells, cancer cells)? How
to attain the selective detection of target cancer cells?

We would like to express many thanks to the referees for their valuable
comments. We have made suitable amendments based on their
suggestions. The issues raised by the referees are carefully addressed
point by point as shown in the following “Response to the referees”.
Response to the referees
Referee #1
Referee’s Comments:
This a good piece of paper and can be accepted after considering the
following suggestions:
Comment 1: The authors need to determine the amounts of Au and Ag, by
dissolving their Gold Nanostars with Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes
composite using AAS and/or ICP.
Response: Thank you so much for your kind advice. The amounts of Au atoms
in MWCNTs/gold nanostars aqueous dispersion was detected by inductively
coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS, NexION 300X) which was
described at the first paragraph in the section 3.2 in our revised manuscript.
That is,
‘The concentration of gold in MWCNTs/gold nanostars aqueous dispersion
was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS,
NexION 300X) and all the concentration mentioned in this paper refers to the
concentration of gold atoms…’
Silver nitrate used in the reaction system is just to promote the growth of gold
nanostars and stabilize the structure. The amounts of Ag have been presented
in our previous paper [Tao Ma et al. 2017 Catalysts].
Comment 2: How can these material can be introduced into body? and what
is dept from the body surface to irradiate these Gold Nanostars with
Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes composite for effective PTT. The authors
need to provide some information about these issues...
Response: Thank you so much for your question and kind advice. This
material can be introduced into body by intravenous injection and
preferentially accumulate in tumors passively through the enhanced
permeability and retention (EPR) effect which means long-circulating drug-
containing microparticulates or large macromolecular aggregates can slowly
accumulate in pathological sites with affected and leaky vasculature such as
tumors, inflammations, and infarcted areas, and facilitate drug delivery in
those areas. [V. P. Torchilin et al. 2006 Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev., Zhenjiang Zhang
et al. 2013 Adv. Mater.]. Due to the tissue penetration depth of near infrared
(NIR) light is limited to between 1 and 2 cm [Smith AM et al. 2009 Nat.
Nanotechnol., Qiu P et al. 2016 Biomaterials], the depth from the body
surface to irradiate MWCNTs/gold nanostars composites is about 1<U+2015>2 cm.
The information is also available at the first paragraph in the section 2 in our
revised manuscript. That is,
‘…In particular, since the tissue penetration depth of near infrared (NIR) light
is limited to 1–2 cm, PTT is considered to be more suitable for cancers of
relatively shallow tissues such as melanoma [Smith AM et al. 2009 Nat.
Nanotechnol., Qiu P et al. 2016 Biomaterials]…’

Referee’s Comments:
This article (RSOS-180159) titled “Decorating Gold Nanostars with

prominent photothermal value and may serve as a novel photothermal agent
for cancer therapy. I would recommend publication after a few minor

Comment 1: In “summary”, on Page 1, line 38, the authors described that
“The MWCNT/gold nanostars hybrid nanomaterial presented 12.4% higher
photothermal efficiency than gold nanostars alone and showed a 2.4-fold
increase over gold nanospheres based on a heating test under 808-nm laser
irradiation”. Please show the detailed data to prove.
Response: Thank you so much for your comments. As shown in Figure 2a, the
temperature of the gold nanospheres, gold nanostars and MWCNT/gold
nanostars solutions increase about R1=14.1 °C, R2=42.9 °C and R3=48.2 °C
respectively under stimulation of an 808-nm laser at a power density of 1.0
W/cm2. Then the statistics were calculated by (R3- R1)/ R1=2.4 and (R3- R2)/
R2=0.124.
Figure 2: The heating curves of (a) deionized(DI) water, gold spherical nanoparticles,
MWCNTs, goldbipyramid, gold nanostars, gold nanostars-PEG, MWCNTs-gold nanostars, and
MWCNTs-gold nanostars-PEG under 808-nm laser irradiation at a power density of 1.0 W/cm2;
the concentration of the materials was 4.9 nM.
Comment 2: In “Result and Discussion”, on Page 4, line 26, how to synthesize
gold nanostars-PEG and MWCNTs/gold nanostars-PEG? Please give a detailed
synthesis and characterization method.
Response: Thank you so much for your kind advice. The synthesize method of
gold nanostars-PEG and MWCNTs/gold nanostars-PEG and characterization
have been added at the first paragraph in the section 3.1 and section 3.2 in
our revised manuscript. That is,
‘…Then the powder of MWCNTs/gold nanostars was added into 1.5 mL
SHPEG5000 (5 µmol·L-1) aqueous solution and stirred for 15 min. After 24 h
at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged at 10000 rpm/min for 15
min to obtain the MWCNTs/gold nanostars-PEG. The gold nanostars and gold
nanostars-PEG were also prepared by the same method without MWCNTs.
The 60 nm gold nanospheres synthesis is presented by Hsiangkuo Yuan et al.
[Yuan H et al. 2012 Nanomedicine] and the gold bipyramids with 110 nm
macroaxis and 35 nm brachyaxis is presented by Julien R G Navarro et al.
[Navarro JR et al. 2012 Nanotechnol.]…’
And ‘The concentration of gold in MWCNTs/gold nanostars aqueous
dispersion was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy
(ICP-MS, NexION 300X) and all the concentration mentioned in this paper
refers to the concentration of gold atoms…’
Comment 3: In “Result and Discussion”, on Page 4, line 54, the authors
described that“Since the greatest ablation efficiency of the materials was
achieved at the highest concentration, we chose a concentration of 0.32 nM
for this experiment, which was the optimum concentration without any toxic
side effects to the cells.”Please show the detailed data to prove ablation
efficiency of the materials.
Response: Thank you so much for your comments. For an optimum
concentration test of the materials, we firstly tested many different
concentrations from low to high and found that all the cells were almost killed
when the concentration reached at 0.32 nM. Then we tested this
concentration by fluorescent staining and confirmed the significant ablation
of cells as shown in Figure 5. Considering the toxicity of high concentration of
materials, we chose the concentration of 0.32 nM without a higher and this
concentration also has non toxicity.
Comment 4: Why did the author choose a power density of 1W/cm2? Please
give temperature rise curves for the same concentration of MWCNT/gold
nanostars under different power curves.
Response: Thank you so much for your comments. The relevant description
was presented at the first paragraph in the section 4.4 and some information
also was provided in Fig. 4(c). As shown in Fig. 4(c), the cell viability did not
have a significant increase when we increase the power density to 1.5 W/cm2
and 2 W/cm2. But when we change it to 0.5 W/cm2, the cell viability
performed a dramatic increase. Considering the biosafety, we chose the
power density of 1W/cm2.
Figure 4. Relative viability of B16-F10 cells incubated with (c) 0.32 nM MWCNTs/gold
nanostars with different power density (3 min).
The temperature rise curves for the same concentration of MWCNT/gold
nanostars under different power curves was displayed in Figure 2b and
relevant description was also presented at the first paragraph in the section
4.2 in our revised manuscript. That is,
‘…As shown in Figure 2b, there is not significant temperature increase when
we changed the power density to 1.5 W/cm2 and 2 W/cm2. But when the
power density decreased to 0.5 W/cm2, the temperature rising had a dramatic
decrease. Considering the biosafety, we chosed 1.0 W/cm2 in our vitro
experiment. ’

Comment 5: Please check the full format of legend, it has a lot of mistakes.

Referee #3
Referee’s Comments:
In this manuscript, the authors reported the preparation and in vitro
viability/biocompatibility characterization of gold nanostars/carbon
nanotube hybrids. They tried to demonstrate an enhanced PPT conversion
efficiency and the promising use for improving cancer therapy. To help
improve the scientific depth of their study, I raised several suggestions as
below, including corrections, further clarification, as well as more result
supplemental.
Comment 1: Abstract: The authors compared the PTT efficiency of their hybrid
nanomaterial with other nanomaterials including nanostar only and
nanosphere. Since multiwalled carbon nanotubes were introduced in their
hybrid nanomaterial, and they also have PTT responsibility, please add the
control test result of PPT for carbon nanotubes only.
Response: Thanks for your comments. We have added control test of carbon
nanotubes alone and the Figure 2a also has been updated in the revised
manuscript. As shown below,
Figure 2. The heating curves of (a) deionized (DI) water, gold spherical nanoparticles,
MWCNTs, gold bipyramid, gold nanostars, gold nanostars-PEG, MWCNTs-gold nanostars, and
MWCNTs-gold nanostars-PEG under 808-nm laser irradiation at a power density of 1.0 W/cm2;
the concentration of the materials was 4.9 nM.
Comment 2: Is there a better way to synthesize nanostars with uniform
branch numbers and length? Unlike nanosphere and nanorods which have
pretty well-developed methods to control uniform size, shape, etc., the
nanostars shown here are in a distribution of shapes/morphology. As the
authors mentioned in their introduction section, these parameters impact
the plasmon property. If the resultant products are not pure in nanomaterials
with a defined shape/morphology, it would be very difficult to apply. Thus, I
am not sure if nanostar is a good candidate than other nanoparticles.
Response: This is a good question and a really challenging question. Although
we tried our best, it is hard to find a better way to synthesize nanostars with
uniform branch numbers and length at this time. Our main interest is focused
on the performance of the nanomaterials in vivo and in vitro. With the
development of synthetic technology, researchers would deal with the
controllable synthesis of gold nanostars as they accomplished the synthesis
of non-branched gold nanoparticles. Hopefully, our current results could
attract more colleagues to join this field. Thanks for your approval.
Comment 3: hydrogen bromide (HBr) was mentioned in the reagents section,
while I did not see its use in the preparation steps.
Response: Thanks for your comments. We double checked and updated
reagents section. The hydrogen bromide (HBr) was removed and many
chemicals were included in the revised manuscript. That is,
‘MWCNTs with a diameter of 20–40 nm and length of 5–15 µm were obtained
from Nanotech Port Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China). Chloroauric acid
(HAuCl4•4H2O, Au = 47.8%) and PEG5000-SH (95%) was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Beijing, China). Silver nitrate (AgNO3) was obtained from
Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). CTAB, tri-sodium
citrate (Na3C6H5O6), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%), nitric
acid (HNO3, 65-68%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and ascorbic acid were
purchased from Sinopharm Group Co. Ltd. All of the above-mentioned
analytical-grade materials were used without further treatment.’
Comment 4: What is the function of nanotubes in the nucleation and growth
of nanostars?.
Response: This is a good question and a really challenging question. It is
unclear of the function of nanotubes in the nucleation and growth of
nanostars at this time. We do need more experiments to understand the
growth of gold nanostars with and without carbon nanotubes in the coming
project.
Comment 5: Section 4.2: where is the MWCNTs/gold nanostars-PEG solution
from? If PEG is not mentioned in the reagents section, why should the authors
show it in the results? The same for “gold bipyramid”.
Response: Thanks for your comments. The preparation of MWCNTs/gold
nanostars-PEG and gold bipyramid has been described at the first paragraph
in the section 3.1 in the revised manuscript. That is,
‘... Then the powder of MWCNTs/gold nanostars was added into 1.5 mL
SHPEG5000 (5 µmol•L-1) aqueous solution and stirred for 15 min. After 24 h at
room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged at 10000 rpm/min for 15 min
to obtain the MWCNTs/gold nanostars-PEG. The gold nanostars and gold
nanostars-PEG were also prepared by the same method without MWCNTs.
The 60 nm gold nanospheres synthesis is presented by Hsiangkuo Yuan et al.
[Yuan H et al. 2012 Nanomedicine] and the gold bipyramids with 110 nm
macroaxis and 35 nm brachyaxis is presented by Julien R G Navarro et al.
[Navarro JR et al. 2012 Nanotechnol.]…’
Comment 6: Section 4.2: When comparing the light-to-heat conversion of
nanostars with other nanoparticles, what parameter was kept constant,
nanoparticle concentration or atom concentration?
Response: Thanks for your comments. When comparing the light-to-heat
conversion of nanostars with other nanoparticles, the concentration of Au
atoms was kept constant. We presented the information at the first paragraph
in the section 3.2 in our revised manuscript. That is,
‘The concentration of gold in MWCNTs/gold nanostars aqueous dispersion
was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS,
NexION 300X) and all the concentration mentioned in this paper refers to the
concentration of gold atoms…’
Comment 7: Section 4.3: the same as before, please clerify which
concentration you used, atom or nanoparticle?
Response: Thanks for your comments. More detailed description was
presented at the first paragraphin thesection 3.2 in our revised manuscript.
That is,
‘The concentration of gold in MWCNTs/gold nanostars aqueous dispersion
was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS,
NexION 300X) and all the concentration mentioned in this paper refers to the
concentration of gold atoms…’
Comment 8: Figure 4b: the authors are suggested to dig deeper the
mechanism behind their PPT results. What happened exactly when
nanoparticles combined with cells, and irradiated by NIR? Did the
nanoparticle enter the cells? Or just generating heat in the outside solution?
The current results could not differentiate. One recommended test is to heat
the cell solution to the same elevated temperature as that when using
nanomaterials, and compare their cell viability. If the results show similar
death, then it is quite possible that the heat is generated outside cells, and
vice versa.
Response: Thanks for your comments. As described at the first paragraph in
section 3.4, before irradiated by NIR, free nanoparticles were removed and
the cells were maintained in fresh medium after washing with PBS. So it can
be determined that the death of cells is due to the fact that the nanoparticles
were swallowed by the cells and generated heat. According to your comments,
we have tested the temperature of outside solution after irradiated by NIR
and it only showed about 40<U+2103>.We also have taken a comparative test as you
advised and no cells death have been detected. Therefore, it could be
confirmed that the heat is generated inside cells.
Comment 9: Figure 5b: please explain what the AO/BE intensities represent.
Response: Thanks for your comments. The AO/BE intensities were calculated
by the software of Image J which AO represents green fluorescence intensity
relevant to living cells and BE represents red fluorescence intensity relevant
to dead cells. In this way, we expressed the viability of the cells more
intuitively in the form of data.
Comment 10: Figure 5b and 6: I did not a significant difference in cell viability
between nanostars only and nanotube/nanostar hybrids.
Response: Thanks for your comments. In Figure 5b, the cell viability dealed
with gold nanostars is much higher than MWCNTs/gold nanostars by
fluorescence intensity calculation just like gold nanostars: AO/(AO+BE)=0.143
and MWCNTs/gold nanostars: AO/(AO+BE)=0.069 which shows significant
difference. In Figure 6, the experiment has been repeated more than 5 times
and we still could see the difference in cell viability between nanostars only
and nanotube/nanostar hybrids although it is not significant. Hopefully, we
could present more interesting results soon. Please approve it.

Referee’s Comments:
The hybrid MWCNTs/gold nanostars material was prepared without requiring
any surfactant, and importantly the material exhibited dramatically improved
photothermal conversion efficiency and cancer cells ablation over gold
nanostars alone and the more conventionally used gold nanospheres. The
research is very useful and the content of this work is abundant. In my opinion,
the manuscript could be considered for publication after minor revisions.
Other comments are given below:
Comment 1: Did the purchased MWCNTs need to be preprocessed, shorten
or carboxylation?
Response: Thanks for your scrutinizing comments. The purchased MWCNTs
need to be preprocessed, shorten and carboxylation. The method have been
added at the first paragraph in section 3.1 in our revised manuscript. That is,
‘The MWCNTs were dealed with a simple method [Liu J et al. 1998 Science].
Briefly, 99.8 mg MWCNTs was dissolved into 10 ml solution with volumetric
ratio of H2SO4/HNO3 of 1: 3 under ultrasonication for 10 h at room
temperature. After that, the solution was diluted with deionized water and
10mmol·L-1 NaOH aqueous solution until it becomes neutral . Then the
solution filtered with 0.22 µm membrane and was vacuum dried at 60°C…’
Comment 2: MWCNTs was very long (5–15 µm), how did MWCNTs act on cells,
adsorb on cell surface or pass through cells?
Response: Thanks for your scrutinizing comments. The MWCNTs was cut as
short as about 50-200 nm which was enough to be swallowed by cells [Liu J
et al. 1998 Science]. The prtreatment method of MWCNTs have been added
at the first paragraph in section 3.1 in our revised manuscript. That is,
‘The MWCNTs were dealed with a simple method [Liu J et al. 1998 Science].
Briefly, 99.8 mg MWCNTs was dissolved into 10 ml solution with volumetric
ratio of H2SO4/HNO3 of 1: 3 under ultrasonication for 10 h at room
temperature. After that, the solution was diluted with deionized water and
10mmol·L-1 NaOH aqueous solution until it becomes neutral . Then the
solution filtered with 0.22 µm membrane and was vacuum dried at 60°C…’
Comment 3: Did MWCNTs/gold nanostars act on all kinds of cells (including
normal cells, cancer cells)? How to attain the selective detection of target
cancer cells?
Response: Thanks for your comments. Thank you so much for your questions.
Gold nanoparticles perform good localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)
with high photothermal conversion efficiency which can be an excellent PTT
agent. Due to the tissue penetration depth of near infrared (NIR) light is
limited to between 1 and 2 cm [Smith AM et al. 2009 Nat. Nanotechnol., Qiu
P et al. 2016 Biomaterials], gold nanoparticles are considered to be more
suitable for cancers of relatively shallow tissues such as breast cancer,
prostate cancer and melanoma [Penghe Qiu et al. 2016 Biomaterials, Shouju
Wang et al. 2013 Adv. Mater., Hsiangkuo Yuan et al. 2012 J. Am. Chem. Soc.,
Ana Espinosa et al. 2016 Adv. Healthcare Mater., Zhang, YJ et al. 2018
Scientific Reports]. The nanomaterials introduced into body is through
intravenous injection and they can preferentially accumulate in tumors
passively through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [V. P.
Torchilin et al. 2006 Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev., Zhenjiang Zhang et al. 2013 Adv.
Mater.]. Then the nanomaterials MWCNTs/gold nanostars were more likely
to act on the cancers cells in shallow tissues which can be more easily
detected just by cut down.
