Ravichandran et al. make a comprehensive study on the production of activated carbon from
Casuarina equisetifolia fruit waste using two different approaches: one- and two-step activation
methods. The referee read with interest the manuscript. However, both methods have been
previously reported, and no progress can be seen in this work. Therefore, the manuscript is not
recommended to be considered for publication.
Other comments:
1) For the title, "of" seems missing after "production".
2) The authors claimed: "The results show that, the two steps activation process was more
effective than one step activation for providing high adsorption performance CFW-based ACs."
3
Any reasons? The authors should clearly clarify it.
3) "Activated carbons were prepared by one and two steps activation methods, as described by
Sugumaran et al and Basta et al. [14, 33]." Any modifications?
4) How is the gas atmosphere for the catalyst preparation? Air or inert gas?
5) "The pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and bulk density of the AC samples was determined by
Ahmedna et al. [35]." All these data were copied from this reported literature? If so, please clarify
it carefully.
6) In conclusion: the authors stated: "the activated carbons produced from CFW can be possible
used as good adsorbents for various environmental applications including treatment of drinking
water" The scope of this study is quite narrow, then how to make such a promising prediction?
7) The resolution of some figures (e.g., Fig. 1, 4) are very low.

Dear Prof. Editor of Royal Society Open Science
Dr. Thomas Foley
Thank you very much for you and reviewer’s comments for helping us to improve our
manuscript. We have taken into account your remarks modifying our manuscript
accordingly. Changes in the text are highlighted in grey to follow them easily. Please,
see bellow the list of answers to reviewers’ comments:
Regarding Reviewer 1:
This reported the Optimization of the route for production activated Carbon from
Casuarina equisetifolia fruit waste. It an interesting topic for activated carbon
production. I think is is proper for publication on Royal Society Open Science, after
the below issues are adressed.
Answer
Many thanks for your decision, I appreciate it very much, as it will be very honor
for us to have publication in RSOS.
1. Is the present preparation methods also applicable for other biomass?
Answer
Yes, but the efficiency of activating agent type and stages of preparation on
adsorption behavior (surface area, MB ,.. iodine adsorption capacities) of the
produced activated carbon will be changed according to chemical constituents of
the used biomass as precursor.
2. The SEM figures should be improved; the scale bar should be clear for reading
Answer
Thank you for providing us instructive suggestions. We agree about your view, but due to
a number of Figs in plot I can t clear it in high font size. That wrote under each SEM is
I will clear only the magnification is x 6 000 in Figure Title, with thanks.
3. except for the performance for adsorption of the prepared material, how it is for
other applications? used for catalysts and others?
Answer
Thank you for your kind comment, we know the ACs have been applied in many
areas, e.g., gas separation and storage, water purification, as well as support
catalysis. These applications are due to the presence of favorable pore geometries
and volumes, moreover it s resistance to acidic and basic environments. For
application as support catalysis, many investigators studied the approaches to
avoid the drawback from inserting the metals, e.g, the poor metal dispersion and
pore blocking of the support . As well as the role of AC texture on its efficiency
as carbon support catalyst.
But in this present article, we focused on optimizing the activating agents, steps
and activating temperature to produce Casuarina Fruit-based AC., convenient for
application in removing aqueous pollutants.
We ‘ll take this comment (LORD willing) in our consideration for our
forthcoming research work, on evaluating the biomass type (i.e., variation in
chemical constituents), activation parameters, as well as type of inserted metal on
porous carbon and its fuctionalization on performance of the product as catalyst
support in hydrogenation reaction. Thank you.
Regarding Reviewer 2:
Comments to the Author(s)
Ravichandran et al. make a comprehensive study on the production of activated
carbon from Casuarina equisetifolia fruit waste using two different approaches: one-
and two-step activation methods. The referee read with interest the manuscript.
However, both methods have been previously reported, and no progress can be seen
in this work. Therefore, the manuscript is not recommended to be considered for
publication.
Answer
Thank you Dr., but I would like to clear you that , in this article we studying the
adsorption efficiency of the produced activated carbon from Casuarina equisetifolia
fruit as a result of changing the type of activating agent (H3PO4, KOH & ZnCl2, as
acid, alkali, and salt agents) , as well as steps of activation (1st and 2 steps). In the
reported literature 14, 33 it concerned on production of activated carbon from rice
straw using KOH activating agent (via one and 2 steps) and one step H3PO4 activating
agent. I think all knowledge the role of chemical constituents (Lignin, hemicellulose,
cellulose, & silica contents) on the adsorption performance of the produced activated
carbon. The chemical constituents of the Casuarina equisetifolia are mainly different
than rice straw, and consequently the behavior of activating approach will also
change. Therefore the optimization of approach should be examined. Moreover, in
this present work, we impregnated the precursor (Casuarina fruit) in activating agent
with concentration 10%; while in previous publication (Refs. 14 & 33), different
ratios (1:1- 4:1) of concentrated activating agent were mixed with rice straw i.e., we
made minor modification for economic activating approach in concentration of
activating agent together with lowering the temperature of KOH activation from
800oC to 600oC than the literatures cited. I illustrated this modification in
experimental section under the sub-title . “2.2. Activated Carbon Production”
Other comments:
1) For the title, "of" seems missing after "production"
.Answer
Thank you for providing us instructive suggestions. I included of” in title.
2) The authors claimed: "The results show that, the two steps activation process was
more effective than one step activation for providing high adsorption performance
CFW-based ACs." Any reasons? The authors should clearly clarify it.
Answer:
Thank you, the results obtained from benefit preparing the ACs by 2-steps than
1 step I are confirmed our explanation reported in Ref. # 33. Where, the
presence of a higher number of heteroatoms in biomass could even promote the
catalytic role of activator (e.g.KOH) on the volatilisation of the material, via
breaking of C-O-C and C-C bonds, hence it leading to a low carbon yield.
While for the 2-steps activation process, biomass is first carbonised, leading to
a higher carbon yield than that of the previous case. KOH then reacts with
carbon (not biomass, so a lower amount of KOH is required), leading to higher
pore volumes and surface areas (as clear in textural properties). Excess of KOH
reacts with ash, giving a soluble form which will be leached off by washing
with water, hence leading to ash-free ACs, and promote the porosity.
I added this paragraph in revised version, with many thanks for your instructive
comment
3) "Activated carbons were prepared by one and two steps activation methods, as
described by Sugumaran et al and Basta et al. [14, 33]." Any modifications?
Answer:
Yes, in this present work, we impregnated the precursor (Casuarina fruit) in
concentration 10% activating agent; while in previous publication (Refs. 14 &
33), different ratios of activating agent were mixed with rice straw., as well as
the temperature used is lower than Ref. (600oC for one step and 700 o for 2-
steps). i.e., we made minor modification for economic activating approach than
the literatures cited.
4) How is the gas atmosphere for the catalyst preparation? Air or inert gas?
Answer:
We activating in air, as the inert gas not available in our lab.
5) "The pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and bulk density of the AC samples was
determined by Ahmedna et al. [35]." All these data were copied from this reported
literature? If so, please clarify it carefully.
Answer
Please forgive us about this misleading, we mean the pH, electrical conductivity
(EC) and bulk density of the AC samples were determined as the methods reported
by Ahmedna et al. [35].
We corrected it in experimental section.
6) In conclusion: the authors stated: "the activated carbons produced from CFW can
be possible used as good adsorbents for various environmental applications
including treatment of drinking water" The scope of this study is quite narrow,
then how to make such a promising prediction?
Answer
Thank you, we recommended it based on the American water work Association
(AWWA, 1991). Where, it has set a lower limit on bulk density at 0.25gmL-1 for
GACs to be of practical use. From the results obtained we noticed that the all
investigated ACs have higher bulk density values than the AWWA, therefore it
will be suitable for water treatment purpose. Moreover, the results obtained under
the sub.title “3.7. Liquid Phase Pollutants Adsorption “, emphasized this view.
7) The resolution of some figures (e.g., Fig. 1, 4) are very low.
Answer:
We are extremely sorry about it, we improved Figs. 4-a and 4.b in revised version;
while for Fig.1, as the chart received from service analysis lab, I can’t plot it
again, therefore I replaced it by Table (Table 2 in revised version) and Figs 4a &
4.b became Figs. 3a & 3b.
Once again, we thank both editor and reviewers for their positive and constructive
comments. We tried our best to improve the manuscript and we hope that the correction will
meet with approval.
Please forgive me for delay in reply.
