The Authors present a field-based assessment of the ecological importance, clientele, and cleaning
behavior of the spotted cleaner shrimp (Periclimenes yucatanicus) in Curacao (Netherlands
Antilles). The data consist of 83 hours of video including over 300 visits and 80 cleans by a total of
35 shrimps. The results indicate that visitation and cleaning rates are significantly higher in the
putative model Ancylomenes pedersoni than in the putative mimic P. yucatanicus, that 50% of
the P. yucatanicus cleans are shorter than 10 seconds, and that 'cheating' rates do not differ
significantly between the two species. The Authors conclude that P. yucatanicus plays a minor
ecological role as a cleaner and that its mimetic status remains unclear. The manuscript is well-
written, the dataset is ok and I have only a few comments on the data analysis and interpretation.
Nevertheless, it is unclear in what respect this study will be of interest to a broad audience of
biologists, and it seems to me that it would better fit a more specialized journal (e.g behavioral,
marine, ecological or zoological).
Specific comments:
What are the relative abundances of the two species at the study site? The fact that the two
species are common at this site while P. ycatanicus is much rarer elsewhere (line 118-119)
indicates that the study site is atypical and might therefore not be representative of the more
general situation across the Caribbean. In particular, if both species are common the requirement
for negative frequency dependent selection of many protective mimicry scenarios (lines 100-102)
may not be satisfied locally, and individuals might adjust their behavior accordingly.
Since all anemones are marked the data could be analyzed at the individual level; what part of
the results can be attributed to differences between individuals within species?
The fact that P. yucatanicus engage in 'cleaning' is not necessary 'discordant' (Line 246), 'cleaning'
by P. yucatanicus could be a form of behavioral mimicry.
Is it possible that what is interpreted as 'cheating' might in fact be unintentional?
Are the cleans significantly shorter in P. ycatanicus than in A. pedersoni?
Potential confounding factor of Anemone species host: that could be briefly addressed in the
discussion
Lines 133-134 (videos were downloaded and analyzed after Huebner and Chadwick): could
provide a few details here
Lines 193-196: difference in proportion of finches occurring during the last five seconds: are they
significantly different?
Lines 197-204: same here can statistical tests can be used to identify which fish species present
significant differences?

Cleaner, mimic or something else? Comparative cleaning observations suggest a limited
ecological role for the cleaner shrimp Periclimenes yucatanicus
Reviewer: Kate S Hutson, James Cook University, Australia
Summary
This manuscript examined cleaning interactions between cleaner shrimps (Periclimenes
yucatanicus and Ancylomenes pedersoni) and their client fishes. An equivalent diversity of
clientel visited the cleaner stations of each shrimp species, although P. yucatanicus was less likely
to engage in a cleaning interaction and those that did engage cleaned for a shorter duration
compared to A. pedersoni.
This is an interesting and complex system to work with and the authors have executed an
intriguing and worthwhile study. I am less convinced about the conclusions drawn as there is not
adequate evidence to suggest a limited ecological role for P. yucatanicus or that it is an aggressive
mimic. I suspect that continued research by the authors may provide further elucidation of the
cleaning activity of these species which could possibly negate the interpretations made in this
paper. Thus, the manuscript would benefit from a carefully considered revision, particularly in
the Introduction, Methods and Discussion, where there is too much emphasis placed on concepts
of ecological role and mimicry.
Recommendation: Publication following major revision.
Major comments:
1. The results do not support the conclusion that P. yucatanicus has a reduced ecological
role as a cleaner species nor that it is a cleaner mimic
The results presented support the conclusion that P. yucatanicus engages in cleaning behaviour
with client fishes less frequently compared to another shrimp species, A. pedersoni, in the mid-
morning. Video records of cleaning interactions did not control for time of day. Thus, the current
4
study does not present evidence to support a reduced ecological role of P. yucatanicus, nor that it
is a cleaner mimic, as the engagement of this shrimp in cleaning for the remaining 22 hours of the
day is unknown. While the authors indicate that time of day does not affect cleaning frequency
for one of the species, A. pedersoni, this is not known for P. yucatanicus. Importantly, it is also
unclear whether time of day may impact cleaning duration. Some cleaner shrimp forage during
the day and night (e.g. Lysmata amboinensis Militz and Hutson (2014) PLoS ONE). We do not
know the extent to which P. yucatanicus engages in cleaning activity over a 24 h period.
I suggest the authors approach their conclusions with more caution considering that their
methodology did not permit examination of the ecological role of shrimp. Moreover, evidence of
cleaning interactions discounts P. yucatanicus as a cleaner mimic (according to the currently
accepted definition). Further research will either confirm the observations here or support an
alternative hypothesis which is not acknowledged in the paper – that P. yucatanicus actively
engages in cleaning activity at alternative times of the day not examined and/or engages more
frequently in incidental cleaning or non-symbiotic foraging compared to A. pedersoni.
2. More detail is required to enable a clear understanding of the experimental design.
- Please include information on the time of year the experiment was conducted and the
duration of the experiment.
- Were video cameras employed on all sites every day?
- It is not clear whether the data collected included an equal contribution from all of the
anemones selected
- It is mentioned that sites were selected randomly – do you mean anemones with shrimp
were selected randomly following the initial mapping?
- Please provide measurements for anemones in the results.
- Please confirm whether all anemones have one shrimp each.
- Did you find any anemones without cleaner shrimp?
- Did you video record any anemone without shrimp as a control to determine whether
the anemone species attracts client visitation compared to the presence of the shrimp?
Minor comments
Introduction
Ln 58 I do not agree with the statement ‘Some of these species may not be true cleaners, because
they do not effectively reduce parasite loads on reef fishes (e.g. McCammon et al.)’. The paper
cited used a variety of cleaner shrimp species and examined their efficacy at removing a parasitic
monogenean, Neobenedenia melleni. The ‘poor’ performance of some of the cleaner shrimp in
this study could be because they are specialist cleaners and that preferred dietary items were not
supplied. In addition, cleaning is not necessarily restricted to parasites. According to the current
accepted definition of cleaning symbiosis, removal can include ectoparasites, bacteria, diseased
and injured tissue and unwanted food particles thus it can be challenging to quantify cleaner
reduction of materials acting negatively on the client.
Discussion
There is no dietary analysis of the two species and so it is assumed that a shorter cleaning
interaction results in minimal parasite removal (ln 212). I would be cautious making this
assumption. It is possible that A. pedersoni and P. yucatanicus may be specialist cleaners in that
they each target different pathogens or parasites infecting fish – thus you would need to test
whether cleaning duration is correlated with cleaning efficacy.

General comments:
This is a well-written account of patterns of cleaner shrimp behavior on a coral reef at Curacao. It
quantifies rates of cleaning, and establishes this shrimp species as a regular cleaners of fishes at
this reef site. The manuscript however would be improved by numerous corrections and
clarifications in the text.
Specific comments:
Abstract
Line 26: Change “remains” to “remain”; this verb is appropriately plural here.
L43: This is a run-on sentence; Change the comma to a period (full stop), and capitalize “we” to
begin a new sentence here.
L43: Change “reduced” to “more limited”, to clarify this relationship. The former term may imply
that the role of this shrimp was previously larger somehow, which is not known.
9
Introduction:
Lines 55-56: Clarify this sentence to define both “dedicated” and “facultative” cleaners. Because
you use these terms later in your manuscript, each needs to be succinctly defined here. For
example: Does dedicated mean life-long? Eats only parasites? Does facultative mean only during
part of life history? Eats other foods all life long? Not clear from your sentence. These terms can
have different meanings depending on the author, so you need to state here how you define
them, and on which references you base those definitions.
Methods
L125: Over what depth range did you collect behavioral data on this reef? Ie: between which
depths did you place your cameras?
L132: Cite references here to justify the use of TCSA as a measure of anemone size, and to clarify
how TCSA was measured. Appropriate references could include articles by Hirose (1985), Hattori
(2002), Chadwick & Arvedlund (2005), and/or Huebner et al. (2012 in MEPS).
L150: What is “Recording time”. Do you mean time of day, or the duration of each recording?
L158: What sources or guide books did you use to identify fish to species level?
L156-168: Your definitions of behavioral categories are scattered and confusing in this paragraph.
This section would benefit from a more methodical approach, in which you define each type of
behavior in the order they naturally occur by shrimp and clients, ie: (1) visit, (2) pose, (3) clean,
and (4) flinch. You need to list a clear, concise definition of each, and cite references. Then
proceed with the details about your expectations and correlates of behaviors.
L161: Did you quantify visits and poses each separately? Or their ratio? Maybe change the text
here to “visits and poses”? Meaning is not clear. These terms each need to be defined clearly, or
perhaps joined into one type of behavior to which a single term is consistently applied.
L162: So, a visit does not involve a pause of 2-3 seconds at the station? How is a visit different
form a pose? In the literature, a fish pose may differ from a visit, and is described as involving the
fish positioning its body head down, opening up the gill cover, etc. Justify why your definition is
different, or otherwise clarify.
L164: Define “flinch”, together with the other behavior categories listed above.
L170: Why do you not report pose rates per hour? Maybe you need to redefine pose vs. visit, and
use different terms to distinguish them?
L182: Change “the following” to “specific” or certain”, for clarity here.
L185: Table 1 is simple and all-text, with no numbers presented. To save space and avoid
presenting unneeded tables, this information could be replaced by 2-3 lines of text with
numbered points, and inserted here.
Results
L190-191: Add also the range of anemone sizes, the minimum and maximum TCSA observed for
each species.
L192-193: Remove “N =” from both parentheses. These are not N’s (sample sizes), unless you
analyzed behaviors separately for each hour, which you do not appear to do.
L206: Run a chi-square type of statistical test here, and report if these 2 ratios differ significantly.
L223: There is no such thing as “slightly non-significant”. Better wording would be something
like: The proportion of fishes that terminated cleans after flinches (cheating: in the last 5 seconds)
was not significantly greater (but only marginally so) for P. yucatanicus than for A. pedersoni. Is
this your meaning and the outcome of this test?
Discussion
L236: You need to cite references supporting the statement that these shrimp “unambiguously
signal”, and/or cite your supplemental video here.
L238: You don’t know the intention of these shrimps; this is anthropomorphizing. Change
“intentionally signaling” to “which appear to signal” or other neutral language.
L285: Add text here to point out a possible cause of this pattern, such as:
“However, fish may use sea anemones as visual cues to locate A. pedersoni shrimp, so anemone
size may matter (Huebner and Chadwick 2012). This may be especially true for B. annulata which
has thinner and more transparent tentacles than does C. gigantea, and would explain why we
10
observed a significant increase in fish cleaning rate with body size in B. annulata but not in C.
gigantea.”
Supplemental information:
Excel file labeled “Manuscript Data”: This is informative and a good addition to the manuscript.
However, the tables in sheets 6 and 7 are incomplete. Missing for some rows are the fish genus
and species names, the durations of visits and cleans (are these in seconds? Not clear for sheet 7),
the times at which flinches occurred, etc. These need to be filled in to create complete data sheets,
or to inform the reader why certain data are missing on each sheet.
Table 1: May not be needed; it could be replaced by 2-3 sentences in the text, as indicated above.
Fig. 1: This also is not necessary: many photographs of these species are available on the internet
and in guide books. This manuscript does not focus on the color patterns of these shrimp, so it’s
hard to see why this figure is needed here. However, if it is retained, it needs scale bars added to
each photo (is that S. helianthus in B?), the species names of the anemones added to the legend,
and the location where each photo was taken. Alternately, one or more images in this figure
could be used as a journal cover image, with appropriate labeling.
Figs. 3 and 4: Add p-values of regression lines to each graph. If any are not p<0.05, then remove
the regression line, as it is not a significant trend, and give the p-value in the figure legend.

Abstract
Ln 31 Just because a cleaner shrimp does not effectively reduce parasite loads does not disqualify
it as a cleaner. The ‘poor’ performance of some cleaner shrimp could be because they are
specialist cleaners and that preferred dietary items were not supplied. In addition, cleaning is not
necessarily restricted to parasites. Cleaning can include ectoparasites, bacteria, diseased and
injured tissue and unwanted food particles. Thus, it needs to be clarified that other authors
hypothesize that this species as a mimic.
Ln 36 change ‘find’ to found
Ln 43 perhaps this cleaner species has a specialised role, rather than a ‘reduced’ role?
Introduction
Ln 62/63 change ‘parasite removal’ to cleaning interactions
Ln 69-70 please clarify in this sentence that the cleaner definition was incorrectly applied to entire
shrimp families and genera.
Ln Change ‘Vaughn’ to Vaughan
Methods
Excellent inclusion of more detail in the methods so the reader can understand the design.
Ln 127 How were the cleaner shrimp species distinguished?
Ln 146 Were unique cleaning stations used? i.e. not cleaning station was sampled twice?

General comments:
This is a well-written account of patterns of cleaner shrimp behavior on a coral reef at Curacao. It
quantifies rates of cleaning, and establishes this shrimp species as a regular cleaners of fishes at
this reef site. The manuscript however would be improved by numerous corrections and
clarifications in the text.
Specific comments:
Abstract
Line 26: Change “remains” to “remain”; this verb is appropriately plural here.
L43: This is a run-on sentence; Change the comma to a period (full stop), and capitalize “we” to
begin a new sentence here.
L43: Change “reduced” to “more limited”, to clarify this relationship. The former term may imply
that the role of this shrimp was previously larger somehow, which is not known.
Introduction:
Lines 55-56: Clarify this sentence to define both “dedicated” and “facultative” cleaners. Because
you use these terms later in your manuscript, each needs to be succinctly defined here. For
example: Does dedicated mean life-long? Eats only parasites? Does facultative mean only during
part of life history? Eats other foods all life long? Not clear from your sentence. These terms can
have different meanings depending on the author, so you need to state here how you define
them, and on which references you base those definitions.
Methods
L125: Over what depth range did you collect behavioral data on this reef? Ie: between which
depths did you place your cameras?
L132: Cite references here to justify the use of TCSA as a measure of anemone size, and to clarify
how TCSA was measured. Appropriate references could include articles by Hirose (1985), Hattori
(2002), Chadwick & Arvedlund (2005), and/or Huebner et al. (2012 in MEPS).
L150: What is “Recording time”. Do you mean time of day, or the duration of each recording?
L158: What sources or guide books did you use to identify fish to species level?
L156-168: Your definitions of behavioral categories are scattered and confusing in this paragraph.
This section would benefit from a more methodical approach, in which you define each type of
behavior in the order they naturally occur by shrimp and clients, ie: (1) visit, (2) pose, (3) clean,
and (4) flinch. You need to list a clear, concise definition of each, and cite references. Then
proceed with the details about your expectations and correlates of behaviors.
L161: Did you quantify visits and poses each separately? Or their ratio? Maybe change the text
here to “visits and poses”? Meaning is not clear. These terms each need to be defined clearly, or
perhaps joined into one type of behavior to which a single term is consistently applied.
L162: So, a visit does not involve a pause of 2-3 seconds at the station? How is a visit different
form a pose? In the literature, a fish pose may differ from a visit, and is described as involving the
fish positioning its body head down, opening up the gill cover, etc. Justify why your definition is
different, or otherwise clarify.
L164: Define “flinch”, together with the other behavior categories listed above.
L170: Why do you not report pose rates per hour? Maybe you need to redefine pose vs. visit, and
use different terms to distinguish them?
L182: Change “the following” to “specific” or certain”, for clarity here.
L185: Table 1 is simple and all-text, with no numbers presented. To save space and avoid
presenting unneeded tables, this information could be replaced by 2-3 lines of text with
numbered points, and inserted here.
15
Results
L190-191: Add also the range of anemone sizes, the minimum and maximum TCSA observed for
each species.
L192-193: Remove “N =” from both parentheses. These are not N’s (sample sizes), unless you
analyzed behaviors separately for each hour, which you do not appear to do.
L206: Run a chi-square type of statistical test here, and report if these 2 ratios differ significantly.
L223: There is no such thing as “slightly non-significant”. Better wording would be something
like: The proportion of fishes that terminated cleans after flinches (cheating: in the last 5 seconds)
was not significantly greater (but only marginally so) for P. yucatanicus than for A. pedersoni. Is
this your meaning and the outcome of this test?
Discussion
L236: You need to cite references supporting the statement that these shrimp “unambiguously
signal”, and/or cite your supplemental video here.
L238: You don’t know the intention of these shrimps; this is anthropomorphizing. Change
“intentionally signaling” to “which appear to signal” or other neutral language.
L285: Add text here to point out a possible cause of this pattern, such as:
“However, fish may use sea anemones as visual cues to locate A. pedersoni shrimp, so anemone
size may matter (Huebner and Chadwick 2012). This may be especially true for B. annulata which
has thinner and more transparent tentacles than does C. gigantea, and would explain why we
observed a significant increase in fish cleaning rate with body size in B. annulata but not in C.
gigantea.”
Supplemental information:
Excel file labeled “Manuscript Data”: This is informative and a good addition to the manuscript.
However, the tables in sheets 6 and 7 are incomplete. Missing for some rows are the fish genus
and species names, the durations of visits and cleans (are these in seconds? Not clear for sheet 7),
the times at which flinches occurred, etc. These need to be filled in to create complete data sheets,
or to inform the reader why certain data are missing on each sheet.
Table 1: May not be needed; it could be replaced by 2-3 sentences in the text, as indicated above.
Fig. 1: This also is not necessary: many photographs of these species are available on the internet
and in guide books. This manuscript does not focus on the color patterns of these shrimp, so it’s
hard to see why this figure is needed here. However, if it is retained, it needs scale bars added to
each photo (is that S. helianthus in B?), the species names of the anemones added to the legend,
and the location where each photo was taken. Alternately, one or more images in this figure
could be used as a journal cover image, with appropriate labeling.
Figs. 3 and 4: Add p-values of regression lines to each graph. If any are not p<0.05, then remove
the regression line, as it is not a significant trend, and give the p-value in the figure legend.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_9
The Authors present a field-based assessment of the ecological importance, clientele, and cleaning
behavior of the spotted cleaner shrimp (Periclimenes yucatanicus) in Curacao (Netherlands Antilles). The
data consist of 83 hours of video including over 300 visits and 80 cleans by a total of 35 shrimps. The
results indicate that visitation and cleaning rates are significantly higher in the putative model
Ancylomenes pedersoni than in the putative mimic P. yucatanicus, that 50% of the P. yucatanicus cleans
are shorter than 10 seconds, and that 'cheating' rates do not differ significantly between the two
species. The Authors conclude that P. yucatanicus plays a minor ecological role as a cleaner and that its
mimetic status remains unclear. The manuscript is well-written, the dataset is ok and I have only a few
comments on the data analysis and interpretation. Nevertheless, it is unclear in what respect this study
will be of interest to a broad audience of biologists, and it seems to me that it would better fit a more
specialized journal (e.g behavioral, marine, ecological or zoological).
Specific comments:
What are the relative abundances of the two species at the study site? The fact that the two species are
common at this site while P. ycatanicus is much rarer elsewhere (line 118-119) indicates that the study
site is atypical and might therefore not be representative of the more general situation across the
Caribbean. In particular, if both species are common the requirement for negative frequency dependent
selection of many protective mimicry scenarios (lines 100-102) may not be satisfied locally, and
individuals might adjust their behavior accordingly.
• We have now added data on abundance of the crustaceans. We did not mark and map every anemone
regardless of crustacean symbiont presence though, so we do not have abundance data on the whole
anemone population. Our experience is that P. yucatanicus abundance is highly variable throughout the
region. In some locals (e.g. Panama, Virgin Islands), Curacao included, they have been nearly as
common as A. pedersoni. In other regions we have been hard pressed to find more than 5 individuals
after a week of making 3 dives a day. A. pedersoni has been consistently abundant throughout the
Caribbean.
Since all anemones are marked the data could be analyzed at the individual level; what part of the
results can be attributed to differences between individuals within species?
• Per Reviewer 2’s comments we have significantly revised the manuscript and take a more cautious
approach to our conclusions. Thus, we focus less on mimicry
The fact that P. yucatanicus engage in 'cleaning' is not necessary 'discordant' (Line 246), 'cleaning' by P.
yucatanicus could be a form of behavioral mimicry.
• As mentioned above, we have significantly revised our focus on mimicry.
Is it possible that what is interpreted as 'cheating' might in fact be unintentional?
• Yes, it is certainly possible. However, there’s no real way of knowing for certain. Client jolts/flinches
have been shown to increase when non-parasitized clients visit cleaners. It is generally accepted this is
in response to removal to a scale or live tissue.
Are the cleans significantly shorter in P. ycatanicus than in A. pedersoni?
• Yes. These data are in the Results. We have clarified the text to make it more explicit.
Potential confounding factor of Anemone species host: that could be briefly addressed in the discussion
Lines 133-134 (videos were downloaded and analyzed after Huebner and Chadwick): could provide a
few details here.
• Added and clarified
Lines 193-196: difference in proportion of finches occurring during the last five seconds: are they
significantly different?
• Almost. We have added this statistical test to the manuscript.
Lines 197-204: same here can statistical tests can be used to identify which fish species present
significant differences?
• We did not conduct this test, but feel as though the table provided makes it clear that most of the
differences between cleaner species can be attributed to visits from goatfishes. We have added text to
this effect.

Cleaner, mimic or something else? Comparative cleaning observations suggest a limited ecological role
for the cleaner shrimp Periclimenes yucatanicus
Reviewer: Kate S Hutson, James Cook University, Australia
Summary
This manuscript examined cleaning interactions between cleaner shrimps (Periclimenes yucatanicus and
Ancylomenes pedersoni) and their client fishes. An equivalent diversity of clientel visited the cleaner
stations of each shrimp species, although P. yucatanicus was less likely to engage in a cleaning
interaction and those that did engage cleaned for a shorter duration compared to A. pedersoni.
This is an interesting and complex system to work with and the authors have executed an intriguing and
worthwhile study. I am less convinced about the conclusions drawn as there is not adequate evidence to
suggest a limited ecological role for P. yucatanicus or that it is an aggressive mimic. I suspect that
continued research by the authors may provide further elucidation of the cleaning activity of these
species which could possibly negate the interpretations made in this paper. Thus, the manuscript would
benefit from a carefully considered revision, particularly in the Introduction, Methods and Discussion,
where there is too much emphasis placed on concepts of ecological role and mimicry.
Recommendation: Publication following major revision.
Major comments:
1. The results do not support the conclusion that P. yucatanicus has a reduced ecological role as a
cleaner species nor that it is a cleaner mimic
The results presented support the conclusion that P. yucatanicus engages in cleaning behaviour with
client fishes less frequently compared to another shrimp species, A. pedersoni, in the mid-morning.
Video records of cleaning interactions did not control for time of day. Thus, the current study does not
present evidence to support a reduced ecological role of P. yucatanicus, nor that it is a cleaner mimic, as
the engagement of this shrimp in cleaning for the remaining 22 hours of the day is unknown. While the
authors indicate that time of day does not affect cleaning frequency for one of the species, A. pedersoni,
this is not known for P. yucatanicus. Importantly, it is also unclear whether time of day may impact
cleaning duration. Some cleaner shrimp forage during the day and night (e.g. Lysmata amboinensis
Militz and Hutson (2014) PLoS ONE). We do not know the extent to which P. yucatanicus engages in
cleaning activity over a 24 h period.
I suggest the authors approach their conclusions with more caution considering that their methodology
did not permit examination of the ecological role of shrimp. Moreover, evidence of cleaning interactions
discounts P. yucatanicus as a cleaner mimic (according to the currently accepted definition). Further
research will either confirm the observations here or support an alternative hypothesis which is not
times of the day not examined and/or engages more frequently in incidental cleaning or non-symbiotic
foraging compared to A. pedersoni.
• We appreciate the constructive feedback. We have significantly overhauled the manuscript with major
revisions to the Intro, Methods, and Discussion, and place less emphasis on ecological role and mimicry.
2. More detail is required to enable a clear understanding of the experimental design.
- Please include information on the time of year the experiment was conducted and the duration of
the experiment.
• Added
- Were video cameras employed on all sites every day?
• They were not. This information is now added
- It is not clear whether the data collected included an equal contribution from all of the anemones
selected
• We recorded a fairly even amount of video across all cleaning stations, and the recording length did
not have a significant relationship with the number of client visits. This information is now added to the
manuscript.
- It is mentioned that sites were selected randomly – do you mean anemones with shrimp were
selected randomly following the initial mapping?
• Yes. Clarified
- Please provide measurements for anemones in the results.
• Added
- Please confirm whether all anemones have one shrimp each.
• Added
- Did you find any anemones without cleaner shrimp?
• Added
- Did you video record any anemone without shrimp as a control to determine whether the anemone
species attracts client visitation compared to the presence of the shrimp?
• No. This information is now added
Minor comments
Introduction
Ln 58 I do not agree with the statement ‘Some of these species may not be true cleaners, because they
do not effectively reduce parasite loads on reef fishes (e.g. McCammon et al.)’. The paper cited used a
variety of cleaner shrimp species and examined their efficacy at removing a parasitic monogenean,
Neobenedenia melleni. The ‘poor’ performance of some of the cleaner shrimp in this study could be
because they are specialist cleaners and that preferred dietary items were not supplied. In addition,
cleaning is not necessarily restricted to parasites. According to the current accepted definition of
cleaning symbiosis, removal can include ectoparasites, bacteria, diseased and injured tissue and
unwanted food particles thus it can be challenging to quantify cleaner reduction of materials acting
negatively on the client.
• Agree. We have removed this sentence from the Introduction as we have re-written most of it.
Discussion
There is no dietary analysis of the two species and so it is assumed that a shorter cleaning interaction
results in minimal parasite removal (ln 212). I would be cautious making this assumption. It is possible
that A. pedersoni and P. yucatanicus may be specialist cleaners in that they each target different
pathogens or parasites infecting fish – thus you would need to test whether cleaning duration is
correlated with cleaning efficacy.
• Agree. We have changed the text to reflect that P. yucatanicus may be a specialist cleaner.
