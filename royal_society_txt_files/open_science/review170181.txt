Review RSOS-160862: Homogeneity in gestural repertoires drives expansion of multilevel society
of wild chimpanzees.
This article is difficult to understand, in part because the key terms are not defined, i.e.,
homogeneity. It takes very careful reading to discover that it refers to the degree of agreement in
gestures in dyads. But it is not clear what data were entered into each homogeneity matrix. Was
concordance judged as frequency measures or as presence/absence of a particular gesture? How
were dyads that did not interact much dealt with? How were dyads with zero values dealt with?
How many different entries were there for each matrix? I notice on the figures that there were
some negative kappa values, which are very rare in practice. Please explain.
A further problem in terms of data relates to multiple assessments of the same data, i.e., the
degree of concordance was assessed both by gesture type and by function. Isn’t there some direct
overlap, for example aren’t all food sharing requests visual gestures? More generally, isn’t this
taking the exact same dataset and considering it once by gesture type and considering it again by
function? Each gesture is of a particular type and has a particular function. Shouldn’t one
decide which way to analyse the data for this study and not double dip? How many different
entries were there for each matrix – this must have varied with different matrices? When many
of the values are zero (~40% of more), then there is a rule of thumb that the results should be
dichotomized (present /absent) rather than considered as a continuous variable (since the mean
is skewed with the large number of zero values). Was this considered in this data set? Were
some dyads dropped or some gesture types dropped due to small sample size?
Is it a problem that there appears to be two primary affiliations as assessed by proximity (NK
with KU, and NK with BB), with all the other proximity affiliations meaningfully less strong?
How would a different pattern of proximity network impact your findings? How generalizable
are these findings to the larger population of chimpanzees in Uganda, all wild chimpanzees, etc?
How much correlation was there in homogeneity between different gesture types (e.g., between
the dyadic values in the visual gesture network and the tactile gesture network as depicted in
supplementary figures 1b &1c).
Another difficulty with understanding this paper is that the hypotheses are not stated clearly,
and the hypotheses are not linked tightly with the analyses. Therefore the reader does not know
what set of results would support and what set of results would allow one to reject the
hypotheses. If repertoire homogeneity is higher in individuals with strong bonds, then you
would expect it to be linked with the strength of the bond. But is time spent in proximity a good
proxy for strength of the bond? How do biological factors contribute to this basic hypothesis in a
conceptual way? (that is, what is the rationale for including some of these variables in some of
the models and not in others?) How would you expect the gesture type to contribute? Is there a
conceptual reason that you would expect homogeneity in only certain types of gestures to relate
to social bonds? And if this is about valence and arousal, then the gestures should be divided, in
a mutually exclusive manner, to indicate different valence and different arousal, and these then
used in the analyses. How do different levels of homogeneity across multiple dyads relate to
group level homogeneity or any of the “multilevel” aspects of chimpanzee society (as mentioned
in the title)?
Please specify the rationale for the inclusion of different variables in each of the models. Usually
these models would either be testing different conceptualizations of the results (with biological
variable only versus with gesture types only, versus with both biological and gesture types) or
comparing the models to find the best fitting model. And the supplementary tables include two
different types of analysis which are not explained.
3
Another difficulty is that the core of the dataset used here, gestural repertoire and proximity
network, has already been published, with other analyses already run on the same dataset. The
relation between the current submission and the existing publications must be made explicit in
the text. For example, half of Table 1 has already been published (e.g., Sci Report, 6:33864). How
do previous findings about bond strength (identifying the importance of being reciprocal) related
to using just close proximity in this study?
Finally, there is a mismatch between the focus of the introduction and discussion with the results.
There are many unexplored assumptions. For example, arousal is an important topic and yet the
reader is not informed about which gestures are thought to be more arousing, and there are no
data presented that relate to arousal, or the success of gestures related to their arousal or
emotional valence. Is arousal synonymous with modality, and if so, then this must be supported
by evidence. The analyses suggest that there are variables significantly related to gestural
homogeneity, but how do those associations relate to 1) causal links as discussed; 2) “multilevel
society” as the title suggests; 3) dominance, a major topic in the discussion – but the reader is not
even told which chimpanzee is the alpha male.
I would like to end on a more positive note. I like the idea that gestures between dyads can vary
in homogeneity, and that this might have meaning in terms of their social interactions, both in
practical and conceptual terms. But I would like the term fully operationally defined, I would
like the descriptive data to be fully presented, and it is necessary to include an evaluation of the
meaningfulness and the limitations of the method and the concept, as well. The conclusions and
claims should be much more closely tied with the analyses, and the hypotheses (which need to be
framed as something that can be rejected if not supported by the results).

This was an interesting and well written study exploring the relationship between gestural
repertoire similarity and social bonding in wild chimpanzees. Although the relationship between
social bonds and repertoire convergence has been explored in the vocal domain, this article
contributes novel evidence for the gestural modality. I think these results have the potential to be
of considerable interest to a broad readership, especially if the authors can make a stronger link to
the human literature relating social preferences to shared language/dialect/accent features. This
also includes some relevant and interesting research on the development of social discrimination
showing that even young infants use accents/languages as a strong inferential cue to in versus
out groups (see Katherine Kinzler’s lab as a starting point)
Structurally, while the paper was well written, I found both the Introduction and Discussion both
very long. They also repeated one another. Both could be cut back without losing much of the
content.
I had a few queries regarding methodology. In particular, more detail is needed about how the
repertoire types were discriminated, and this needs to be presented more explicitly in the main
text (including N of gestures). To genuinely understand the claim for homogeneity, it is
important to know how different the different gesture types actually were and whether variation
in similarity was accounted for, as some gestures are undoubtedly more similar than others. I.e.
looking at table S2, an arm drop and an arm flap could arguably be considered more similar at
least in production than a genital present. For example, a given dyad may produce gestures that
are classed here as ‘different’ yet in reality, show overlap in form/function. Without assessing the
relationship between different gesture types and the extent to which they themselves overlap (for
example using the Hobaiter et al approach of taking into account desired outcomes), it is difficult
to assess the validity of these interpretations.
Another methodological issue is that the analyses appear to only be based on the occurrence of
different gesture types rather than also accounting for rates of occurrence. Rates here could really
have an impact on the outcome of these analyses. For example, one dyad may regularly use the
same gesture type together whereas another dyad may also use the same gesture type once, yet
this would be counted the same. Accounting for relative occurrence of the convergent gestures
would be able to control for these differences.
Overall, I would request the authors to remove the term ‘copying’ and replace it with something
more neutral that reflects the findings of this study- basically because you can’t really get at the
mechanism and in any case, you also can’t say with these data who might be ‘copying’ who, you
only show an overlap in their repertoire. There are numerous possible social learning/social
affordance mechanisms that could explain convergence in repertoire
A line of argument, that the authors state at L167, is that gesture homogeneity may provide a
more time-efficient mechanism for social bonding. However, it is worth considering that it may
instead be more an emergent feature of to increasing efficiency in communication as a result of
repeated interactions (i.e. rather than bonding per se). For example, individuals who know one
another well can used a reduced set of signals and be understood, this is a finding shown in
transmission chain experiments for language evolution studies for example (see Simon Kirby
lab). There is increased efficiency in communication over multiple interactions, which could
provide a different approach to this data (though indeed does not need to exclude bonding being
involved too)
Figures: all of the panels of Figure 1 show a very clear outlier dyad. Could you rerun the analyses
without this outlier and present the model results?
Title: Given that you cannot determine the direction of the relationship between social bonding
and gesture homogeneity, a more neutral title would be more suitable. Something like ‘ The
relationship between gesture repertoire convergence and social bonding in a multilevel primate
society’. Note addition of ‘a’ before multi-level too.
9
Abstract: The term homogeneity either needs to be explained here, or another word should be
used in its place. Perhaps consider using the term ‘convergence’ instead
Here are some more specific points:
L9: more accurate to replace to ‘relates to’
L10: I would rephrase as ‘the association between social bonding, as measured by spatial
proximity
L14: likewise I would rephrase to ‘social rank, as measured by pant-grunting behaviour’. This is
clearer to non-specialists who won’t know what pant-grunting is
L37: Please add a ‘however’ before ‘there is a limit’
L39: The way this sentence is constructed, it sounds as if primate group sizes are only determined
via grooming, which clearly does not take into account all the other behavioural and ecological
factors constraining group sizes in primates and other animals. Thus please can amend.
L64: It would increase the scope of this article and strengthen the evolutionary relevance of this
paper if more literature from human research relating to social group perceptions and
linguistic/communicative similarities could be added here (as explained above), so I would make
this into a new para.
L70: Before launching into the chimp data, it would make structural sense to first introduce
chimpanzees here and multilevel societies (i.e. move up sections from L105)
L100: could you provide a ref for this?
L121: I found this finding confusing, please rephrase
L125: as compared to low-intensity pant-hoots? are there such a thing. If not, remove the term
L126: phrased as it is here, it’s not clear why you state that gestures are used to maintain social
relationships when the finding focuses on pant-hoot vocalisations.
L140: please rephrase to ‘this species of primate, but probably other species too’
L165: please briefly explain, with references, what pant grunting is. Non-chimpanzee researchers
may not know.
L166-203: this section is very long, it can be reduced and cut up
L271: Please provide IOR for gesture type
L314: There is a singularity issue with the interaction between reproductive similarity and sex.
Although females can be either reproductively active or not, males can only be reproductively
active (according to your definition) therefore the effect of reproductive similarity cannot be
compared within males, only females. Female parity should also be taken into account, as this is
known to have relevant influence on female social relationships with both males and other
females.
L429: start new para here. Also same for L458]
10
L500: Sex and age are bimodal in your analyses, so please rephrase this part (in any case, you
can’t be more or less similar in regards to sex, you are either the same sex or you’re not)
The effects of age similarity could also be explained by biological constraints. i.e. Individuals
within the same age categories may also be biolgically constrained to showing overlaps in their
communication use, as is the case shown for the vocal repertoire. Please add this alternative
explanation for these data
L538: please provide references

used in its place. Perhaps consider using the term ‘convergence’ instead
Here are some more specific points:
L9: more accurate to replace to ‘relates to’
L10: I would rephrase as ‘the association between social bonding, as measured by spatial
proximity
L14: likewise I would rephrase to ‘social rank, as measured by pant-grunting behaviour’. This is
clearer to non-specialists who won’t know what pant-grunting is
L37: Please add a ‘however’ before ‘there is a limit’
L39: The way this sentence is constructed, it sounds as if primate group sizes are only determined
via grooming, which clearly does not take into account all the other behavioural and ecological
factors constraining group sizes in primates and other animals. Thus please can amend.
L64: It would increase the scope of this article and strengthen the evolutionary relevance of this
paper if more literature from human research relating to social group perceptions and
linguistic/communicative similarities could be added here (as explained above), so I would make
this into a new para.
L70: Before launching into the chimp data, it would make structural sense to first introduce
chimpanzees here and multilevel societies (i.e. move up sections from L105)
L100: could you provide a ref for this?
L121: I found this finding confusing, please rephrase
L125: as compared to low-intensity pant-hoots? are there such a thing. If not, remove the term
L126: phrased as it is here, it’s not clear why you state that gestures are used to maintain social
relationships when the finding focuses on pant-hoot vocalisations.
L140: please rephrase to ‘this species of primate, but probably other species too’
L165: please briefly explain, with references, what pant grunting is. Non-chimpanzee researchers
may not know.
L166-203: this section is very long, it can be reduced and cut up
L271: Please provide IOR for gesture type
L314: There is a singularity issue with the interaction between reproductive similarity and sex.
Although females can be either reproductively active or not, males can only be reproductively
active (according to your definition) therefore the effect of reproductive similarity cannot be
compared within males, only females. Female parity should also be taken into account, as this is
14
known to have relevant influence on female social relationships with both males and other
females.
L429: start new para here. Also same for L458]
L500: Sex and age are bimodal in your analyses, so please rephrase this part (in any case, you
can’t be more or less similar in regards to sex, you are either the same sex or you’re not)
The effects of age similarity could also be explained by biological constraints. i.e. Individuals
within the same age categories may also be biolgically constrained to showing overlaps in their
communication use, as is the case shown for the vocal repertoire. Please add this alternative
explanation for these data
L538: please provide references

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
The authors have gone to effort to revise this paper and have endevoured to respond to reviewer
comments, which is good. Nevertheless, while certain sections have improved, I’m afraid that Im
not sure the current paper, overall, is a substantially improved as a result. I found the results
15
much more difficult to follow and thus wasn’t sure how to assess the takehome message. I also
don’t agree with the title change and subsequent sections to that effect. These results still show a
relationship between social bonding behaviours and gestural homogeneity- which is not the same
as directionality. The title, which claims that gesture homogeneity is a bonding mechanism is
misleading. Rather than addressing this point in the last version, the authors opted for their own
version of the title, which Im afraid is no better in this regard
Unfortunaely, I found the results very long and often difficult to follow. There are now so many
results presented, it is difficult to keep track of the goals of the paper or extract which results
might be important. Given that you are more interested in social bonding rather than 9 different
individual measures of bonding (i.e. your main hypotheses is about bonding not these individual
measures), it would be clearer and also statistically more sound to combine them into an index
measure, which includes weighting of the input measures for their contributions. Your measures
of social bonding are likely to be highly correlated thus it doesn’t make sense to analyses
separately. An adapted CSI index which includes appropriate weighting or otherwise a PCA
would produce a more coherent story. The reader is going to drown in theses results and at the
end of a very long discussion and results section, not be necessarily clear about what the study
shows
For long distance communication (acoustic gestures), I also don’t think the most parsimonious
biological explanation is bonding, it is more likely to be for communication- cohesion between
non-visible group members. I agree this is likley mediated by bonding, but this does not mean it
functions to bond, per se. (to test this would require different approach)
The section on GLMMs is lacking lots of key pieces of information, thus it is difficult to assess the
validity of their analyses. The type of model, distribution type/ family and identity link need to
be explained. As well, diagnostic checks need to be completed to ensure model stability. If the DV
is scale data (presumably so), you need to check that the model isn’t over-dispersed, and if so, use
an alternative model. You should also check the collinearity of your IVs using variance inflation
factors. The use of random slopes for individual is needed to control for potential variation
among individuals- you may not be interested in this but you nevertheless need to control for it
The Discussion is also very long, clocking in at about 2300-2500 words. After a long results
section, I recommend to cut this back to provide more clarity and removing sections that are
tangential to the main goals
Some more specific points:
L27: I’m not sure if physical anthropology is really the domain where this is most discussed, it
would be more relevant to discuss it in terms of evolutionary sciences or otherwise
psychology/biology need to be mentioned
L46: I’m not sure what the apostrophes are for, typo?
L51: I would put the definition as a separate sentence
L55: this is not strictly true. Lameira and colleagues, plus some other work, reveal acquisition of
new voiced and unvoiced calls in orangutans
L75: I think you mean cognitively demanding not cognitively complex. Please amend
L148: please could you outline briefly why these 12 Ids were followed and not others?
L163: How is visual attention operationally defined?
L180: could you explain this 60% rule in more detail? It’s not clear if this is at an individual level,
16
a group level or what. Also the paper it comes from seems to be a general text, not gestural. A
more specific gesture text would be relevant to add here
L190: likewise, this also does not make sense. By their nature, a limb movement that may
constitute an intentional gesture in one event may not be an intentional gesture in another. Just
because it can function and show intentionality it doesn’t mean it always does. i.e. arm flap may
be used both intentionally and non-intentionally.
L209: Please detail what an eliciting stimuli is
L265: detail about how maximal tumescence was coded is needed
L271: this section doesn’t include about rates, despite them being analysed in the results section-
please add
L367: this section should be in your methods with much greater detail about how you ran these
models
L656: likewise, a more standard ‘communication’ function would be a more obvious explanation
here, that is mediated though social bonds but not to bond per se. At least you don’t have enough
to data to demonstrated functionality

Review RSOS-160862: Homogeneity in gestural repertoires drives expansion of multilevel
society of wild chimpanzees.
This article is difficult to understand, in part because the key terms are not defined, i.e.,
homogeneity. It takes very careful reading to discover that it refers to the degree of
agreement in gestures in dyads. But it is not clear what data were entered into each
homogeneity matrix. Was concordance judged as frequency measures or as presence/absence
of a particular gesture?
We have now explained this more clearly:
Lines 47 - 48
This study examines how this homogeneity of gestural repertoire (defined as the degree
of overlap in the presence or absence of gesture types in the repertoire of dyads) is related
to social bonds of wild chimpanzees, measured by time dyads spend in close proximity
(within 2 m).
Lines 308 - 321
In order to determine the degree of homogeneity in the gestural repertoires between focal
chimpanzees, we used Cohen’s Kappa coefficient[73]. This statistic measures the degree
of agreement in presence/ absence of gestures between dyad partners. If the repertoire of
gestures is in complete agreement with the repertoire of gestures of the dyad partner then
the Cohen’s Kappa coefficient equals 1 (exactly the same repertoire). However, if the
repertoire of gestures is in complete disagreement with the repertoire of gestures of the
dyad partner then the Cohen’s Kappa coefficient equals -1 (completely different
repertoire). In this study the whole repertoire of gestures of each focal subject was
compared within dyads (Supplementary Table 2)[14]. In addition to all gestures
combined, the Cohen’s kappa coefficient for each dyad was computed separately for
visual, tactile, auditory short-range and auditory long-range gestures. In the analyses all
12 focal subjects (132 dyads) contributed data with exception of analyses by modality,
where subject KU was excluded as KU did not gesture in auditory short-range modality.
How were dyads that did not interact much dealt with?
All dyads were connected through homogeneity network. This is now explained:
In all gesture homogeneity networks (overall, by modality) all dyad partners were
connected (100% of all connections were present).
Moreover, we have now excluded one subject from the analyses (KU) who did not gesture
at all in the auditory short range modality. Subsequently all homogeneity networks by
modality now contain fewer dyads and subjects. This was explained:
One subject (KU) did not gesture in auditory short-range modality and was subsequently
excluded from the analyses by modality of gestures (Supplementary Figure 2 a – e). In
this model, the dependent proximity network consisted of 52.7% of connections – 58
connections out of potential 110 connections were present in this proximity network
(Supplementary Figure 1b).
How were dyads with zero values dealt with?
These were now excluded as explained above.
How many different entries were there for each matrix?
We have now given the number of entries for each matrix:
In all gesture homogeneity networks (overall, by modality) all dyad partners were
connected (100% of all connections were present).
In this proximity network, the chimpanzees were connected to 50% of other focal
individuals – 66 out of potential 132 connections to group members were present
(Supplementary Figure 1a).
In this model, the dependent proximity network consisted of 52.7% of connections – 58
connections out of potential 110 connections were present in this proximity network
(Supplementary Figure 1b).
I notice on the figures that there were some negative kappa values, which are very rare in
practice. Please explain.
We have now explained:
If the repertoire of gestures is in complete agreement with the repertoire of gestures of
the dyad partner then the Cohen’s Kappa coefficient equals 1. However, if the repertoire
of gestures is in complete disagreement with the repertoire of gestures of the dyad partner
then the Cohen’s Kappa coefficient equals -1.
A further problem in terms of data relates to multiple assessments of the same data, i.e., the
degree of concordance was assessed both by gesture type and by function. Isn’t there some
direct overlap, for example aren’t all food sharing requests visual gestures? More generally,
isn’t this taking the exact same dataset and considering it once by gesture type and considering
it again by function? Each gesture is of a particular type and has a particular
function. Shouldn’t one decide which way to analyse the data for this study and not double
dip?
We have now excluded function from the analyses as suggested.
How many different entries were there for each matrix – this must have varied with different
matrices? When many of the values are zero (~40% of more), then there is a rule of thumb that
the results should be dichotomized (present /absent) rather than considered as a continuous
variable (since the mean is skewed with the large number of zero values). Was this considered
in this data set? Were some dyads dropped or some gesture types dropped due to small sample
size?
The proximity networks had approximately 50% of connections. We checked the
validity of our findings by dichotomising proximity network according to the strength
of the social bond and this produced the same result. We have briefly explained this in
the main manuscript and placed the full details of these additional analyses in
Supplementary Information 2 within the ESM.
Is it a problem that there appears to be two primary affiliations as assessed by proximity (NK
with KU, and NK with BB), with all the other proximity affiliations meaningfully less
strong? How would a different pattern of proximity network impact your findings? How
generalizable are these findings to the larger population of chimpanzees in Uganda, all wild
chimpanzees, etc?
We have now included this assessment in the limitations section of the discussion (lines
537 – 551)
How much correlation was there in homogeneity between different gesture types (e.g., between
the dyadic values in the visual gesture network and the tactile gesture network as depicted in
supplementary figures 1b &1c).
In terms of the modality networks, these were not correlated as shown by Model 3:
We next examined predictors of proximity by repertoire homogeneity, taking into
account modality of gestures (auditory short-range, auditory long-range, tactile and
visual, Model 3). One subject (KU) did not gesture in auditory short-range modality and
was subsequently excluded from the analyses by modality of gestures (Supplementary
Figure 2 a – e). In this model, the dependent proximity network consisted of 52.7% of
connections – 58 connections out of potential 110 connections were present in this
proximity network (Supplementary Figure 1b). Only the repertoire homogeneity of visual
gestures significantly predicted close proximity (r2 = 0.244, ß = 0.278, p = 0.048, Model 3,
Fig. 1), with no significant relationship between homogeneity in other gestures and
proximity.
Another difficulty with understanding this paper is that the hypotheses are not stated clearly,
and the hypotheses are not linked tightly with the analyses. Therefore the reader does not know
what set of results would support and what set of results would allow one to reject the
hypotheses. If repertoire homogeneity is higher in individuals with strong bonds, then you
would expect it to be linked with the strength of the bond.
We have now included more detailed hypothesis in the introduction;
In this study we examine whether overlap in the gestural repertoire between pairs
of chimpanzees (homogeneity) is related to the strength and number of social bonds
maintained with others (e.g. duration of time spent within 2 meters per hour spent in the
same party). Specifically, we predict that if genetic canalization of gestures shapes
homogeneity of repertoire, then we would expect maternal kinship to be associated with
homogeneity of repertoire between individuals in the dyad. In contrast, if homogeneity of
gestures is shaped by preferences for maintaining social bonds with particular individuals
then we would expect to find association between homogeneity of gestures and measures
of social bonding (e.g. duration of time spent in close proximity, rate of gesturing, sex
similarity, age similarity, reproductive similarity, pantgrunt rate).
Homogeneity in gestural communication may function to reduce the time and
cognitive demands of maintaining social bonds in large primate groups by providing
time-efficient way of maintaining social relationships. In particular, the different
properties of visual, tactile and auditory gestures make modalities of gestures
differentially suited to maintaining different types of social bonds[20]. Where the bonding
mechanism is based on homogeneity in visual gestures, this can occur through one-to-one
interaction, and requires that at least some degree of close proximity and one-to-one prior
visual attention is maintained and thus a relatively low number of individuals can be
bonded with at any one time. Additionally these interactions demand that adjustment to
the recipient is made in relation to the history of past interactions with them. The bonding
strategy through one-to-one homogeneity in communication is therefore ineffective in
reducing the demands on social bonding in large proximity networks. In contrast, a
larger-scale, group-level bonding through homogeneity in auditory gestures can take
place in absence of direct visual contact or one-to-one interaction. In contrast with one-
to-one bonding whereby individuals establish social relationships based on preferences to
any group members, group level bonding demands that that all individuals bond
collectively to a shared social partner (e.g. dominant male of the community). In this style
of bonding, auditory gestures made by a dominant male of the community can be
perceived and reproduced by several individuals simultaneously which may enable
bonding with weakly bonded social partners, with whom one-to-one interactions are only
infrequent[20]. Such group-level bonding through homogenous auditory gestures can
exploit on a larger scale the psychopharmacological mechanisms underlying social
bonding through homogeneity in one-to-one interactions[30]. Thus, we predict that if one-
to-one bonding and group-level bonding operate in maintaining different types of bonds
then the bonds individuals will have with other individuals will be differentiated, with
strong social relationships based on one-to-one homogeneity in visual gestures, whereas
all group members will bond to the dominant male through homogeneity in auditory
gestures. Thus, there may be a switch from one-to-one homogeneity in visual gestures to
group-level homogeneity of auditory gestures when the individuals maintain large
proximity networks. However, how this individual variation in one-to-one and group-
level homogeneity in gestures relates to social bonding and the structuring of social
groups has not yet been explored.
But is time spent in proximity a good proxy for strength of the bond?
We have now explored this issue in the Introduction and included additional analysis to
evaluate whether this metric is a good measure of social bonds:
Finally, in this study we used the duration of time pairs of chimpanzees spent in
close proximity (within 2m), per hour spent in the same party, as a measure of the
strength of the social bond between dyads. Whilst there is no commonly agreed criteria
to measure the strength of social bonds within or between species [61], the duration of
proximity between individuals is one of the most widely used measures due to its
applicability across species with different types of affiliative behaviour [12, 33, 52, 61-64].
To validate our measure of proximity as an index of social bonding, we examined how it
relates to other commonly used measures of social bonding in primates – grooming, joint
activity and mutual visual attention [4, 12, 52, 62-66].
How do biological factors contribute to this basic hypothesis in a conceptual way? (that is,
what is the rationale for including some of these variables in some of the models and not in
others?)
We have now included specific hypothesis as detailed here:
In this study we examine whether overlap in the gestural repertoire between pairs
of chimpanzees (homogeneity) is related to the strength and number of social bonds
maintained with others (e.g. duration of time spent within 2 meters per hour spent in the
same party). Specifically, we predict that if genetic canalization of gestures shapes
homogeneity of repertoire, then we would expect maternal kinship to be associated with
homogeneity of repertoire between individuals in the dyad. In contrast, if homogeneity of
gestures is shaped by preferences for maintaining social bonds with particular individuals
then we would expect to find association between homogeneity of gestures and measures
of social bonding (e.g. duration of time spent in close proximity, rate of gesturing, sex
similarity, age similarity, reproductive similarity, pantgrunt rate).
Homogeneity in gestural communication may function to reduce the time and
cognitive demands of maintaining social bonds in large primate groups by providing
time-efficient way of maintaining social relationships. In particular, the different
properties of visual, tactile and auditory gestures make modalities of gestures
differentially suited to maintaining different types of social bonds[20]. Where the bonding
mechanism is based on homogeneity in visual gestures, this can occur through one-to-one
interaction, and requires that at least some degree of close proximity and one-to-one prior
visual attention is maintained and thus a relatively low number of individuals can be
bonded with at any one time. Additionally these interactions demand that adjustment to
the recipient is made in relation to the history of past interactions with them. The bonding
strategy through one-to-one homogeneity in communication is therefore ineffective in
reducing the demands on social bonding in large proximity networks. In contrast, a
larger-scale, group-level bonding through homogeneity in auditory gestures can take
place in absence of direct visual contact or one-to-one interaction. In contrast with one-
to-one bonding whereby individuals establish social relationships based on preferences to
any group members, group level bonding demands that that all individuals bond
collectively to a shared social partner (e.g. dominant male of the community). In this style
of bonding, auditory gestures made by a dominant male of the community can be
perceived and reproduced by several individuals simultaneously which may enable
bonding with weakly bonded social partners, with whom one-to-one interactions are only
infrequent[20]. Such group-level bonding through homogenous auditory gestures can
exploit on a larger scale the psychopharmacological mechanisms underlying social
bonding through homogeneity in one-to-one interactions[30]. Thus, we predict that if one-
to-one bonding and group-level bonding operate in maintaining different types of bonds
then the bonds individuals will have with other individuals will be differentiated, with
strong social relationships based on one-to-one homogeneity in visual gestures, whereas
all group members will bond to the dominant male through homogeneity in auditory
gestures. Thus, there may be a switch from one-to-one homogeneity in visual gestures to
group-level homogeneity of auditory gestures when the individuals maintain large
proximity networks. However, how this individual variation in one-to-one and group-
level homogeneity in gestures relates to social bonding and the structuring of social
groups has not yet been explored.
How would you expect the gesture type to contribute? Is there a conceptual reason that you
would expect homogeneity in only certain types of gestures to relate to social bonds?
We have not considered these gestures by each type separately – this is now explained in
the limitations
And if this is about valence and arousal, then the gestures should be divided, in a mutually
exclusive manner, to indicate different valence and different arousal, and these then used in the
analyses.
We have now excluded this aspect from the manuscript entirely.
How do different levels of homogeneity across multiple dyads relate to group level
homogeneity or any of the “multilevel” aspects of chimpanzee society (as mentioned in the
title)?
We have now explained this more clearly in the Introduction:
Homogeneity in gestural communication may function to reduce the time and
cognitive demands of maintaining social bonds in large primate groups by providing
time-efficient way of maintaining social relationships. In particular, the different
properties of visual, tactile and auditory gestures make modalities of gestures
differentially suited to maintaining different types of social bonds[20]. Where the bonding
mechanism is based on homogeneity in visual gestures, this can occur through one-to-one
interaction, and requires that at least some degree of close proximity and one-to-one prior
visual attention is maintained and thus a relatively low number of individuals can be
bonded with at any one time. Additionally these interactions demand that adjustment to
the recipient is made in relation to the history of past interactions with them. The bonding
strategy through one-to-one homogeneity in communication is therefore ineffective in
reducing the demands on social bonding in large proximity networks. In contrast, a
larger-scale, group-level bonding through homogeneity in auditory gestures can take
place in absence of direct visual contact or one-to-one interaction. In contrast with one-
to-one bonding whereby individuals establish social relationships based on preferences to
any group members, group level bonding demands that that all individuals bond
collectively to a shared social partner (e.g. dominant male of the community). In this style
of bonding, auditory gestures made by a dominant male of the community can be
perceived and reproduced by several individuals simultaneously which may enable
bonding with weakly bonded social partners, with whom one-to-one interactions are only
infrequent[20]. Such group-level bonding through homogenous auditory gestures can
exploit on a larger scale the psychopharmacological mechanisms underlying social
bonding through homogeneity in one-to-one interactions[30]. Thus, we predict that if one-
to-one bonding and group-level bonding operate in maintaining different types of bonds
then the bonds individuals will have with other individuals will be differentiated, with
strong social relationships based on one-to-one homogeneity in visual gestures, whereas
all group members will bond to the dominant male through homogeneity in auditory
gestures. Thus, there may be a switch from one-to-one homogeneity in visual gestures to
group-level homogeneity of auditory gestures when the individuals maintain large
proximity networks. However, how this individual variation in one-to-one and group-
level homogeneity in gestures relates to social bonding and the structuring of social
groups has not yet been explored.
Please specify the rationale for the inclusion of different variables in each of the
models. Usually these models would either be testing different conceptualizations of the
results (with biological variable only versus with gesture types only, versus with both
biological and gesture types) or comparing the models to find the best fitting model.
We have now given detailed explanation of the hypothesis as explained above.
And the supplementary tables include two different types of analysis which are not explained.
We have now explained the analyses:
Proximity and communication networks were created for each behaviour type separately.
Each network matrix consisted of 12 rows and 12 columns, with each row and column
denoting a different focal chimpanzee. The values in each cell of the matrix represented
the value for that particular behaviour for a specific pair of chimpanzees (e.g. the
duration of time spent in close proximity per hour spent in the same party between Bwoba
and Hawa). The proximity and communication networks used in this study were
weighted, i.e. each cell consisted of a continuous value representing the value of
behaviour, rather than a 1 or a 0 indicating the presence or absence of a tie. In repertoire
homogeneity networks the value of Cohen’s Kappa coefficient between dyads was entered
in the matrices. The repertoire homogeneity networks were undirected. For instance, the
overlap in gesture repertoire between Bwoba and Hawa was the same as the overlap
between Hawa and Bwoba. The proximity networks were treated as directed. For
instance, the duration of time spent in close proximity by Bwoba to Hawa may be
different to the duration of time spent in close proximity by Hawa to Bwoba. From these
network matrices, centrality measures were calculated, using normalized degree
centrality [74]. Normalised degree centrality is defined as the average value of each row
or column of the network matrix i.e. the average value of that behaviour for each focal
chimpanzee. The homogeneity network was undirected and therefore only one degree
value for each focal subject was obtained. This stands for to the mean value of
homogeneity of gesture repertoire of each focal subject with all possible ties which are
present. The proximity network was different for the focal-non focal subject dyads (e.g.
BB to HW was different from HW to BB) and therefore in degree and out degree were
calculated separately. Out degree refers to proximity directed by the focal chimpanzee to
conspecifics, whilst in degree refers to proximity directed by conspecifics towards the
focal chimpanzee. Moreover, to provide descriptive data on proximity, the normalized
mean degree was determined by dichotomizing and symmetrizing the networks[75].
Normalised mean degrees stand for to the mean proportion of all possible ties which are
present. In order to dichotomize the network, all values over zero were scored as 1
(present) and all values of zero were classed as absent. For symmetrisation, a tie was
scored as present if there was a 1 in either of the two cells corresponding to each pair of
individuals (cell i, j or cell j, i).
General standard inferential statistics cannot be used on network data because the
observations that make up network data are not independent of each other. Thus,
randomisation (or permutation) tests are used, whereby the observed value is compared
against a distribution of values generated by a large number of random permutations of
the data. The proportion of random permutations in which a value as large (or as small)
as the one observed is then calculated, and this provides the p value of the test [75]. MR-
QAP regression (Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure) was used to
determine the relationships between proximity and homogeneity of gestures[75]. MR-
QAP regression is similar to standard regression because it enables the examination of
the effect of a number of predictor variables (e.g. visual and tactile homogeneity network)
on an outcome variable (e.g. proximity network). Amongst several different types of MR-
QAP regression that are available, we used Double Dekker Semi-Partialling MR-QAP
regression, which is robust against the effects of network autocorrelation and skewness
in the data. The number of permutations used in this analysis was 2,000. For the node-
level regressions, we used a similar procedure, using 10,000 random permutations to
assess the effect of a number of predictor variables (e.g. the normalized mean degree for
homogeneity of gestures, sex of focal chimpanzee) on the outcome variable (e.g. proximity
in degree).
Finally, Geary’s C statistic was used to examine autocorrelation between attribute data
(e.g. the total duration of observation) and network data (e.g. homogeneity of visual
gesture network). When there is no association between variables, the Geary statistic has
a value of 1.0, with values of less than 1.0 indicating a positive association and values over
1.0 indicating negative association. UCINET 6 for Windows [76] was used to carry all
data transformations and analyses.
Another difficulty is that the core of the dataset used here, gestural repertoire and proximity
network, has already been published, with other analyses already run on the same dataset. The
relation between the current submission and the existing publications must be made explicit in
the text. For example, half of Table 1 has already been published (e.g., Sci Report,
6:33864). How do previous findings about bond strength (identifying the importance of being
reciprocal) related to using just close proximity in this study?
This has now been done:
Previous research using the same dataset as in current study showed that
chimpanzees display a large variation in the number of conspecifics with whom they
maintain social relationships[11]. In smaller networks chimpanzees form strong social
bonds through grooming (e.g. mutually grooming), gestures (e.g. gestures to initiate
mutual grooming, greetings) and vocalisations (e.g. panthoot chorus accompanied by
visual gestures). However, in larger networks the social bonds chimpanzees have with
others become weaker and time and cognitively more complex to manage. Recent study
suggests that loud auditory gestures accompanied by panthoot where other group
members join with panthoots accompanied by presence or absence of gestures (so-called
synchronized high intensity panthoot) are used to maintain relationships with weakly
bonded individuals. For instance, the rate of synchronized high intensity panthoot is
associated with presence of weakly bonded individuals in the network. Further, the rate
of synchronized high intensity panthoot but not one-to-one gestures increases with
increasing individual network size, which provides indication that gestural
communication may be used flexibly to enable growth of social relationships in
chimpanzees [11].
In addition, three modalities of gestures, such as visual gestures (received through
looking), tactile gestures (received through touch) and auditory gestures (received
through hearing) seem to play an important role in developing and maintaining social
bonds in chimpanzees [13, 53, 54]. Previous data on gestural communication on the
Budongo population of wild chimpanzees used in the current study revealed that different
modalities of gestural communication are differentially associated with proximity in this
population of chimpanzees [20]. Pairs of chimpanzees with high levels of close proximity
had higher rates of visual gestures, but lower rates of tactile and auditory long-range
gestures. Further, individual chimpanzees that had a larger number of proximity bonds
had higher rates of tactile and auditory gesture, but lower rates of visual gestures. This
suggests that modality of gesturing may play a role in maintaining social relationships in
groups of primates – larger groups are more time and cognitively intensive to manage,
and thus require differentiation by modality of gestures to maintain more diverse set of
social relationships.
Finally, there is a mismatch between the focus of the introduction and discussion with the
results. There are many unexplored assumptions. For example, arousal is an important topic
and yet the reader is not informed about which gestures are thought to be more arousing, and
there are no data presented that relate to arousal, or the success of gestures related to their
arousal or emotional valence. Is arousal synonymous with modality, and if so, then this must
be supported by evidence.
We have now excluded arousal and valence from the paper entirely.
The analyses suggest that there are variables significantly related to gestural homogeneity, but
how do those associations relate to 1) causal links as discussed; 2) “multilevel society” as the
title suggests; 3) dominance, a major topic in the discussion – but the reader is not even told
which chimpanzee is the alpha male.
I would like to end on a more positive note. I like the idea that gestures between dyads can
vary in homogeneity, and that this might have meaning in terms of their social interactions,
both in practical and conceptual terms. But I would like the term fully operationally defined,
I would like the descriptive data to be fully presented, and it is necessary to include an
evaluation of the meaningfulness and the limitations of the method and the concept, as
well. The conclusions and claims should be much more closely tied with the analyses, and the
hypotheses (which need to be framed as something that can be rejected if not supported by the
results).
We thank the reviewer for these helpful comments and have revised the paper
extensively in light of these comments, with a new Introduction and new statistical
analyses. We hope that these changes make the key focus of the paper, and the rationale
for the variables included in the models, clearer.

Comments to the Author(s)
This excellent analysis will make a very worthwhile contribution to our understanding of
chimpanzees and their rich communication use in maintaining complex social relationships.
The method is quite complex but applied well to show the relationship between gesture type
and how this function in relationships. And the gestural overlap among dyads.
The intro is a bit long and perhaps some of it could appear only in the discussion, particularly
where there is redundancy.
We thank the reviewer for these kind comments. We have completely restructured the
introduction and it is now more focused on the key research questions we address in this
paper.
I only have minor suggestions for changes.
Line 104 add “that” between relationships and individual
This has now been done
Line 170 add “an” between by and experienced
This has now been done
Line 228 add Homogeneity of visual gestures increased as dyad time increased.
We have added this information
Line 234-5 extra spaces in r values.
We put in extra spaces in the r values.
Line 273 could restate what that relationship is eg positively or negatively.
We have now made clearer in the opening paragraph of the discussion that there is a
positive relationship between homogeneity of visual gestures and time spent in close
proximity.
Line 276 where state tend to be more ambiguous, restate how this is supported.
We have now excluded discussion of the ambiguity of different gesture types from the
manuscript.
This fascinating result, has it been replicated in human research?
Frankly we don’t know
Line 286 – the proximity indegree should be defined
We now defined proximity indegree:
The proximity network was directed and therefore in degree and out degree were
calculated separately. Out degree refers to proximity directed by the focal chimpanzee
to conspecifics, whilst in degree refers to proximity directed by conspecifics towards the
focal chimpanzee.
Line 289. After the modality of the gestures… restate the supporting finding.
Line 316 conspecific should have ‘
These changes have been made.

Abstract: A key challenge for primates living in large, stable social groups is monitoring and
responding appropriately to emotional states. Chimpanzees have a large repertoire of gestures
through which an array of emotional states are expressed, thereby facilitating social
interactions. Overlap in communication repertoires plays a key role in social bonding and in
structuring multi-level societies, but how social interaction affects homogeneity in the
gestural repertoire of primates is poorly understood. We used social network analysis to
examine the associations between close proximity and homogeneity in the gestural repertoire
of wild chimpanzees. Homogeneity in visual gestures was related to the amount of time pairs
of chimpanzees spent in close proximity (within 2 m) and the rate of visual gesturing.
Further, homogeneity in gestures with both a negative valence (e.g. threat) and positive
valence (e.g. gestures to initiate mutual grooming) was related to proximity. Dominant
individuals who maintained a high degree of proximity to others had a higher homogeneity of
visual and auditory long-range gestures. These findings suggest that homogeneity in gestural
communication plays a key role in maintaining a large and diverse set of social relationships
and have important implications for understanding the patterning of interactions in multi-
level societies.

Comments to the Author(s)
This was an interesting and well written study exploring the relationship between gestural repertoire
similarity and social bonding in wild chimpanzees. Although the relationship between social bonds
and repertoire convergence has been explored in the vocal domain, this article contributes novel
evidence for the gestural modality.
We thank the reviewer for these kind comments and their very helpful suggestions for how to
improve this paper. We have substantially revised this paper in light of these comments,
addressing new areas of research, making the Introduction and Discussion more focused and
reanalysing some of the data based on different categorization of chimpanzee pairs. We have also
now only focused on adult to adult communication rather than communication by adult towards
all group members.
I think these results have the potential to be of considerable interest to a broad readership,
especially if the authors can make a stronger link to the human literature relating social preferences
to shared language/dialect/accent features. This also includes some relevant and interesting
research on the development of social discrimination showing that even young infants use
accents/languages as a strong inferential cue to in versus out groups (see Katherine Kinzler’s lab as a
starting point) Structurally, while the paper was well written, I found both the Introduction and
Discussion both very long. They also repeated one another. Both could be cut back without losing
much of the content.
We have now cut down the length of the paper and avoided repetition in the Introduction and
Discussion sections. We have also now reviewed the work of Katherine Kinzler and other
researchers in this area in the first paragraph of the Introduction and referred back to this work in
the Discussion. We agree that adding this human literature to the paper makes the paper more
relevant to a broader readership.
I had a few queries regarding methodology. In particular, more detail is needed about how the
repertoire types were discriminated, and this needs to be presented more explicitly in the main text
(including N of gestures). To genuinely understand the claim for homogeneity, it is important to
know how different the different gesture types actually were and whether variation in similarity was
accounted for, as some gestures are undoubtedly more similar than others. I.e. looking at table S2,
an arm drop and an arm flap could arguably be considered more similar at least in production than a
genital present. For example, a given dyad may produce gestures that are classed here as ‘different’
yet in reality, show overlap in form/function. Without assessing the relationship between different
gesture types and the extent to which they themselves overlap (for example using the Hobaiter et al
approach of taking into account desired outcomes), it is difficult to assess the validity of these
interpretations.
Full and comprehensive details of how the repertoire types were discriminated have been
described in previously published work [1, 2], so we have now referred to those publications in the
method section (lines 188-195). We have now provided the N for gestures in the text and Table 1.
The most common method for discriminating gesture types, in chimpanzees and for other
primates, is to describe them based on the morphology of the gesture. This is now explained in the
methods section, with references to this literature (lines 188 – 195).
We agree that for a full understanding of gestural communication as well as the morphology of
the gesture, it is important to consider the desired outcome of the gesture and this is something
we and other researchers have explored at length in previous publications [1, 3-5]. However, this
research has shown that there is not a straightforward, one-to-one link between a specific gesture
type and a dominant or desired outcome. As a recent review paper discussed, the repertoire of
gestures is much larger than the number of meanings and context can also affect the meaning of a
specific gesture [5, 6]. We feel our approach to establishing the gestural repertoire is in line with
the majority of the other research in this area, and it is therefore appropriate to assess how
homogeneity of these gesture types is related to social bonding. However, we do now discuss
different ways of establishing the repertoire in the Discussion and make suggestions for future
research in this area (lines 692 - 711).
Another methodological issue is that the analyses appear to only be based on the occurrence of
different gesture types rather than also accounting for rates of occurrence. Rates here could really
have an impact on the outcome of these analyses. For example, one dyad may regularly use the
same gesture type together whereas another dyad may also use the same gesture type once, yet
this would be counted the same. Accounting for relative occurrence of the convergent gestures
would be able to control for these differences.
We have now explored this issue more thoroughly in the methods section (lines 283 – 298). The
most widely used method to assess similarity of gestural repertoire, across individuals or across
groups, has been to use Cohen’s Kappa, based on the presence and absence of gesture types. We
now refer to these studies in the Methods section.
We agree that it is interesting to examine the repertoire based on rates of gesturing, rather than
just whether a particular gesture is present or absent in an individuals’ repertoire. For this reason
we have now expanded the results section and also added the analyses of sequences where rates
of gesturing can be taken into account. Since, such analyses could not be performed on subadult
subjects in our study we have now limited all of the analyses to gestures performed by adults and
directed at other adult individuals. Subsequently all of the analyses have been redone and focus
on the adults in this paper.
Overall, I would request the authors to remove the term ‘copying’ and replace it with something
more neutral that reflects the findings of this study- basically because you can’t really get at the
mechanism and in any case, you also can’t say with these data who might be ‘copying’ who, you only
show an overlap in their repertoire. There are numerous possible social learning/social affordance
mechanisms that could explain convergence in repertoire
We have removed all the terms copying and discussed this issue in more depth in the Discussion,
acknowledging that further research would be required to get at specific mechanisms (lines 730 -
745). We have only left the term copying in when specifically discussing the work of Lemasson et
al. (2016), who used this term in the title of their paper and concluded that “we believe that
subordinate female tend to copy leaders’ voices”.
A line of argument, that the authors state at L167, is that gesture homogeneity may provide a more
time-efficient mechanism for social bonding. However, it is worth considering that it may instead be
more an emergent feature of to increasing efficiency in communication as a result of repeated
interactions (i.e. rather than bonding per se). For example, individuals who know one another well
can used a reduced set of signals and be understood, this is a finding shown in transmission chain
experiments for language evolution studies for example (see Simon Kirby lab). There is increased
efficiency in communication over multiple interactions, which could provide a different approach to
this data (though indeed does not need to exclude bonding being involved too)
We have now reviewed this interesting body of research in the Introduction (lines 79 -92) and
referred back to it in the Discussion (lines 650 - 661). Our recent findings on this population of
chimpanzees suggest that regular interaction partners actually have a larger visual repertoire size,
not a smaller one as may be predicted from this body of research. However, the efficient
communication through reduced repertoire may take place in auditory short range gestures.
Figures: all of the panels of Figure 1 show a very clear outlier dyad. Could you rerun the analyses
without this outlier and present the model results?
We acknowledge that there is an outlier in Figure 1 however since we have now provided
additional data on sequences and the results on adults do not have an outlier we did not rerun the
analyses by removing the dominant male from the dataset.
Title: Given that you cannot determine the direction of the relationship between social bonding and
gesture homogeneity, a more neutral title would be more suitable. Something like ‘ The relationship
between gesture repertoire convergence and social bonding in a multilevel primate society’. Note
addition of ‘a’ before multi-level too.
We have now changed the title to remove any directionality: Convergence and divergence in
gesture repertoires as an adaptive mechanism for small-scale and large-scale social
bonding in wild chimpanzees
Abstract: The term homogeneity either needs to be explained here, or another word should be used
in its place. Perhaps consider using the term ‘convergence’ instead
The term homogeneity has now been explained in the abstract as referring to overlap in
communication repertoires. We would prefer to use the term homogeneity in the abstract as that
is the term we use throughout the paper.
Here are some more specific points:
L9: more accurate to replace to ‘relates to’
This has been changed.
L10: I would rephrase as ‘the association between social bonding, as measured by spatial proximity
This has been added and the sentence has been rephrased.
L14: likewise I would rephrase to ‘social rank, as measured by pant-grunting behaviour’. This is
clearer to non-specialists who won’t know what pant-grunting is
This has been added
L37: Please add a ‘however’ before ‘there is a limit’
As part of the restructuring of the Introduction, this sentence has now been deleted.
L39: The way this sentence is constructed, it sounds as if primate group sizes are only determined via
grooming, which clearly does not take into account all the other behavioural and ecological factors
constraining group sizes in primates and other animals. Thus please can amend.
As part of the restructuring of the Introduction, this sentence has now been deleted
L64: It would increase the scope of this article and strengthen the evolutionary relevance of this
paper if more literature from human research relating to social group perceptions and
linguistic/communicative similarities could be added here (as explained above), so I would make this
into a new para.
This literature to humans has now been added, as explained above (lines 36 - 42).
L70: Before launching into the chimp data, it would make structural sense to first introduce
chimpanzees here and multilevel societies (i.e. move up sections from L105)
We agree – we have now restructured the Introduction and introduced the chimpanzees much
earlier (lines 59 - 68).
L100: could you provide a ref for this?
This sentence has been deleted as part of the restructuring of the Introduction
L121: I found this finding confusing, please rephrase
L125: as compared to low-intensity pant-hoots? are there such a thing. If not, remove the term
L126: phrased as it is here, it’s not clear why you state that gestures are used to maintain social
relationships when the finding focuses on pant-hoot vocalisations.
In this paper, we focus solely on gestural communication, not vocal communication. So for clarity
of argument the discussion of gestures accompanied by vocalisations has been removed from the
Introduction.
L140: please rephrase to ‘this species of primate, but probably other species too’
As part of the restructuring of the Introduction, this sentence has now been deleted.
L165: please briefly explain, with references, what pant grunting is. Non-chimpanzee researchers
may not know.
This has now been explained, with reference to relevant research (lines 167 -169)
L166-203: this section is very long, it can be reduced and cut up
The introduction has been restructured and the material in this section is now covered elsewhere
in the Introduction and Discussion. Overall the Introduction has been reduced in length, from
2,413 words in the original manuscript to 1677 words in this revised version, whilst also including
new area of research relating to humans.
L271: Please provide IOR for gesture type
This was reported in one of our previous publications and it is now also reported here (lines 251 –
252), with reference to the relevant paper [2].
L314: There is a singularity issue with the interaction between reproductive similarity and sex.
Although females can be either reproductively active or not, males can only be reproductively active
(according to your definition) therefore the effect of reproductive similarity cannot be compared
within males, only females. Female parity should also be taken into account, as this is known to have
relevant influence on female social relationships with both males and other females.
We thank the reviewer for noting this important point. In network analysis, the unit of analysis is
the dyad, so pairs of chimpanzees, not individual chimpanzees, are classified according to specific
attributes. Thus we have now classified dyads as either reproductively active (oestrus female and
male), or not reproductively active (oestrus female and oestrus female; oestrus female and non-
oestrus female; non-oestrus female and male, male and male). So the comparison we are making
for pairs of chimpanzees is whether or not that pair is reproductively active, or not reproductively
active. This classification was used because whether or not the dyad is reproductively active may
affect the degree of proximity. Sex is then taken into account by classifying dyads as same-sex or
opposite sex. This is now detailed in the Methods section (lines 249 – 266).
We have recalculated all the MRQAP network models using this new classification of
reproductively active dyads and provided the updated results in this revised paper and in the
Supplementary Information. We have also revised Supplementary Table 1 with the new
categories.
We agree that female parity can influence social relationships. All the females were parous – this
information is now included in the Methods section.
L429: start new para here. Also same for L458]
We have now started a new paragraph where suggested, which we agree improves the readability
of these results sections.
L500: Sex and age are bimodal in your analyses, so please rephrase this part (in any case, you can’t
be more or less similar in regards to sex, you are either the same sex or you’re not). The effects of
age similarity could also be explained by biological constraints. i.e. Individuals within the same age
categories may also be biolgically constrained to showing overlaps in their communication use, as is
the case shown for the vocal repertoire. Please add this alternative explanation for these data
This has now been rephrased, with the terms same-sex and opposite-sex dyads used, instead of
sex similarity. This explanation has now been added into the Discussion relation to age, with
reference to relevant research (lines 716 – 729).
L538: please provide references
These have now been provided.

Abstract: A key challenge for primates living in large, stable social groups is maintaining social
relationships with group members. Chimpanzees use grooming to maintain social relationships but
also have a large repertoire of gestures and gestural communication may act as a more time-
efficient social bonding mechanism. Overlap in communication repertoires plays a key role in social
bonding and in structuring multi-level societies, but how homogeneity in the gestural repertoire of
primates affects social interaction is poorly understood. We used social network analysis to examine
the associations between close proximity and homogeneity in the gestural repertoire of wild
chimpanzees. Homogeneity in visual gestures was related to the amount of time pairs of
chimpanzees spent in close proximity (within 2 m) and the rate of visual gesturing. In contrast,
homogeneity in auditory gestures was related to the rate of pant-grunt calls (an indicator of rank).
Dominant individuals who maintained a high degree of proximity to others had a higher
homogeneity of visual and auditory gestures. These findings suggest that homogeneity in gestural
communication plays a key role in maintaining a differentiated set of strong and weak social
relationships and thus has important implications for understanding the patterning of interactions in
multi-level societies.

- any results section with more than 4 statistics should be presented in a table rather than long and
unreadable paragraphs.
We have now included all of the results in the form of summary in the table, pointing out the positive
and negative significant correlations between variables.
- the over-long discussion section should be cut down where possible
We have now cut down the original discussion from 2584 words to 1952 words in the current version of
the paper.
- the minor comments of the reviewer should be implemented
All of these minor comments have been implemented:
L27: I’m not sure if physical anthropology is really the domain where this is most discussed, it would be
more relevant to discuss it in terms of evolutionary sciences or otherwise psychology/biology need to be
mentioned
We have changed it to ‘science of human origins’ (line 52)
L46: I’m not sure what the apostrophes are for, typo?
We have now deleted this sentence (line 69)
L51: I would put the definition as a separate sentence
This was done – lines 73 - 74
L55: this is not strictly true. Lameira and colleagues, plus some other work, reveal acquisition of new
voiced and unvoiced calls in orang-utans
We have now included this additional information (lines 76 – 78)
L75: I think you mean cognitively demanding not cognitively complex. Please amend
This was amended (lines 96 – 98)
L148: please could you outline briefly why these 12 Ids were followed and not others?
This was done – lines 212 – 214)
L163: How is visual attention operationally defined?
This was described - lines 225 - 226
L180: could you explain this 60% rule in more detail? It’s not clear if this is at an individual level, a
group level or what. Also the paper it comes from seems to be a general text, not gestural. A more
specific gesture text would be relevant to add here
This was done – lines 254 - 256
L190: likewise, this also does not make sense. By their nature, a limb movement that may constitute an
intentional gesture in one event may not be an intentional gesture in another. Just because it can
function and show intentionality it doesn’t mean it always does. i.e. arm flap may be used both
intentionally and non-intentionally.
We have now clarified how this was coded more precisely (lines 243 – 249)
L209: Please detail what an eliciting stimuli is
This was done – line 276
L265: detail about how maximal tumescence was coded is needed
This was done – lines 332 - 334
L271: this section doesn’t include about rates, despite them being analysed in the results section- please
add
We have now explained more clearly that rates were not included in this paper – line 357 – 359.
L367: this section should be in your methods with much greater detail about how you ran these models
We now explained in the methods how these models were run (lines 382 – 417)
L656: likewise, a more standard ‘communication’ function would be a more obvious explanation here,
that is mediated though social bonds but not to bond per se. At least you don’t have enough to data to
demonstrated functionality
We have now made it clear that different modes of acquisition would have to be explained by
longitudinal study (lines 720 – 743)
L695-721: This part is speculative and as you do not have any data to support it, I would remove
We are grateful for the reviewer’s valuable input – we have removed this whole section as it was
speculative.
