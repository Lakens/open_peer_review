1. Important investigation about possible social consequences of short sleep.
2. You wrote that subjects came into the lab on two occasions; once after being instructed to
sleep for 8h for two consecutive nights (mean total sleep time per night = 7 hours 35 minutes, SD
= 71minutes), and once after only being allowed 4h in bed for two consecutive nights (mean total
sleep time per night = 4 hours 15 minutes, SD = 40minutes). Just a minor thing, but why did
subjects in average sleep longer than 4 hours (i.e. 4,25 hrs) yet they had been instructed to sleep 4
hours? Could you please show the range of sleep duration in each of the sleep conditions? Do
ratings correlate with time spent asleep in the short sleep condition?
3. Did subjects who had been photographed know about the purpose of the study? If yes, it
might be possible that just being aware of having not enough sleep is more relevant to the loss of
perceived sociability, as inferred from the face, than sleep loss itself. It would be worth
investigating whether just telling someone you look tired (yet they had a full night of sleep) is
enough to reduce his/her sociability. The latter is however not subject of this paper and can
therefore be disregarded in the revision process.
4. Did subjects who had been photographed rate their own sociability? If yes, how much
did these ratings differ from those of the rater population?
5. The way how raters may perceive others may also depend on their own sleep duration.
This is to say: did you measure sleep of the raters?
6. You wrote that 50 facial photos (two of each subject, one from each sleep condition) were
administered to the raters. Does sleep loss compromise sociability to the same degree in
individuals? In other words, does a subject who is generally perceived attractive (i.e. across sleep
conditions) exhibit the same drop in perceived attractiveness following sleep loss like someone
who is generally perceived less attractive?
7. Any gender effects? For instance, did females of the rater cohort differentially evaluate
the social costs of sleep deprivation than male raters?

This paper presents the results of a study in which photographs of subjects taken after both well-
rested and sleep-restricted conditions were assessed by raters blinded to the sleep condition.
Assessments included appearances of sleepiness, health, attractiveness, and trustworthiness as
well as whether the rater would want to socialize with the subject after each condition. This work
adds to the existing literature, as previous studies have looked at rater perception of these
characteristics after total sleep deprivation but not after partial sleep restriction, the latter of
which is more common.

Language usage throughout the manuscript is a major issue. Verb tense is inconsistent, and the
text switches frequently between second person and third person narrative. Most sections of the

Comments to the Author(s)
1.Important investigation about possible social consequences of short sleep.
2.You wrote that subjects came into the lab on two occasions; once after being
nstructed to sleep for 8h for two consecutive nights (mean total sleep time per night = 7
hours 35 minutes, SD = 71minutes), and once after only being allowed 4h in bed for two
consecutive nights (mean total sleep time per night = 4 hours 15 minutes, SD =
40minutes). Just a minor thing, but why did subjects in average sleep longer than 4
hours (i.e. 4,25 hrs) yet they had been instructed to sleep 4 hours? Could you please
show the range of sleep duration in each of the sleep conditions? Do ratings correlate
with time spent asleep in the short sleep condition?
A few subjects slept longer than the instructed 4 hours, despite the instructions, and some
subjects were unable to sleep the full 8 hours. Specifically, three subjects slept on average
only two hours less per night during the sleep-restriction nights. The average difference in
sleep timing between the two conditions was 3h30m (standard deviation 47m). This
nformation has been added to the manuscript along with the ranges (p.6 lines 125-130. "
Mean total sleep time per night during the normal sleep condition was 7 hours (h) 35 minutes
m), SD = 71m, ranging between 6h 43m and 9h 39m. During the sleep restriction condition
he mean total sleep time per night was 4h 15m, SD 40m, range 3h 42m-6h 52m. The average
difference in hours slept per night between the two conditions was 3h 30m, SD = 47m,
ndicating that subjects on average received approximately 7h less sleep during the sleep
restriction condition."). We believe that this is a more informative measure of the sleep
difference within the subjects and thank the reviewer for the comment.
The ratings have weak correlations, ranging from 0.06 to 0.10, with time spent asleep in the
short sleep condition. The only exception is trustworthiness, which does not correlate at all
with time slept.
3.Did subjects who had been photographed know about the purpose of the study? If yes,
t might be possible that just being aware of having not enough sleep is more relevant to
he loss of perceived sociability, as inferred from the face, than sleep loss itself. It would
be worth investigating whether just telling someone you look tired (yet they had a full
night of sleep) is enough to reduce his/her sociability. The latter is however not subject
of this paper and can therefore be disregarded in the revision process.
Subjects were not informed of the purpose of the study. This has now been clarified in the
manuscript (p. 7, line. 140-141 " Subjects were not informed about the purpose of the study or
he photos prior to being photographed."). Although they were of course aware of being
photographed, they did not know what factors would be investigated with these photos. We
agree that one's own perception of appearing tired and feeling social may affect how one is
perceived by others, and this would be interesting to look into in future studies!
4.Did subjects who had been photographed rate their own sociability? If yes, how much
did these ratings differ from those of the rater population?
Unfortunately, subjects did not rate their own sociability and we are thus unable to compare
hese ratings. Previous studies indicate that sleep deprivation does lead to decreased feelings
of sociability (e.g. Haack & Mullington, 2005) but whether this is related to how willing
others would be to socialize with someone is yet to be studied.
5.The way how raters may perceive others may also depend on their own sleep duration.
This is to say: did you measure sleep of the raters?
Although we did ask the raters how they had slept the previous night, the effect of raters'
sleep was not a purpose of the study. Having many raters (122) minimizes the risk that the
esults are biased due to their sleep history. In this case, 70% of the raters reported sleeping
between 7 and 9 hours, with only 9% sleeping less than 6 hours and 6.5% sleeping 10 or
more. That being said, to answer the reviewer's question, we ran these analyses and found that
aters' own sleep (duration, quality, and sufficiency) did not affect their ratings. However, we
agree with the reviewer that this is an interesting topic, especially regarding how people with
nsomnia would perceive others who are sleep deprived, considering their own dissatisfaction
with their appearance (e.g. Gupta, Gupta, & Knapp, 2014). We believe that a fruitful way to
study this would be to measure how objective sleep, subjective sleepiness, and sleep
misperception of the raters could predict how they perceive other people.

directly correlated with insomnia severity: A prospective study in a non-clinical sample. J.
Derm. Treat. 26 (2). p.193-197.
6.You wrote that 50 facial photos (two of each subject, one from each sleep condition)
were administered to the raters. Does sleep loss compromise sociability to the same
degree in individuals? In other words, does a subject who is generally perceived
attractive (i.e. across sleep conditions) exhibit the same drop in perceived attractiveness
ollowing sleep loss like someone who is generally perceived less attractive?
This is an interesting question, but difficult to answer here since the variation in attractiveness
was rather low; none of the subjects were considered very attractive on average (maximum
average rating for a subject being 4.75). To answer the reviewer, we ran an analysis which
showed that there was no interaction effect of sleep loss and attractiveness on sociability (b =
0.02, SE = 0.02, p = 0.28). It is possible that with more extreme variations in attractiveness
here would be bigger differences in the effects of sleep restriction.
We have added the following on page 15, lines 322-325: "It is further likely that the
vulnerability of one's appearance to sleep loss differs between individuals. Studies on such
ndividual differences should ideally include more subjects, with a larger range than the
present study regarding e.g. attractiveness."
7.Any gender effects? For instance, did females of the rater cohort differentially
evaluate the social costs of sleep deprivation than male raters?
There were no gender effects of either raters or photographed subjects on the social costs of
sleep deprivation.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper presents the results of a study in which photographs of subjects taken after
both well-rested and sleep-restricted conditions were assessed by raters blinded to the
sleep condition. Assessments included appearances of sleepiness, health, attractiveness,
and trustworthiness as well as whether the rater would want to socialize with the subject
after each condition. This work adds to the existing literature, as previous studies have
ooked at rater perception of these characteristics after total sleep deprivation but not
after partial sleep restriction, the latter of which is more common.

Abstract
1. It is unclear what the authors mean by "other-rated health" in the second sentence of
he abstract. Perhaps the authors could provide examples. The first two sentences of the
abstract are a bit vague and confusing as currently written.
The first two sentences in the abstract have been changed to "The importance of assessing
evolutionarily relevant social cues suggests that humans should be sensitive to others' sleep
history, as this may indicate something about their health as well as their capacity for social
nteraction. Recent findings show that acute sleep deprivation and looking tired are related to
decreased attractiveness and health, as perceived by others. This suggests that one might also
avoid contact with sleep-deprived, or sleepy-looking individuals, as a strategy to reduce
health risk and poor interactions. "
2. The authors should report the sex and age ranges of both the 25 participants and the
122 raters in the abstract.
This has now been added.
Introduction
3. Page 3, line 48: It is unclear what is meant by "when primed with disease". Were the
raters told that subjects were ill?
n the study referred to, subjects viewed a presentation about germs and transmission of
contagious disease before answering questions about their personality or performing a
behavioural approach/avoid task. This disease prime (exposure to the disease-related
presentation) has been clarified in the manuscript (p.3, line 54-55 "... when exposed to disease
primes, through pictures and information about contagious disease...").
Methods
4. Page 6, line 43: The authors note that subjects were photographed at the same time on
both occasions. This appears to be reported as clock time. Was there a difference in the
ength of time awake at which photos were taken between conditions?
The subjects were indeed photographed at the same clock time on both occasions, rather than
after the same amount of time awake. During sleep restriction, 19 out of the 25 subjects arose
earlier in the morning than during the normal sleep days. This resulted in an average of 62
minutes (SD = 85m) longer awake before the photograph was taken. The effects of time
awake are described further on p.10, lines 224-227: "Adding time awake to the separate
models did not affect the effect of sleep restriction on willingness to socialize or
attractiveness, although it slightly decreased the effects on health (new b = -0.08, SE = 0.04,
p = 0.041) and other-rated sleepiness (new b = 0.17, SE = 0.05, p < 0.001)."
5. Page 6, line 43: Was the photographer blind to the condition of the subject?
The photographer was blind to the condition of the subject. This has been added to the
methods section, p.7, line 133, "...by a photographer blind to the condition of the subject."
6. Page 6, line 55: Was the person who chose the representative photo well-rested? Did
he same person pick the representative photo for all participants across both
conditions?
We did not enquire about the sleep history of the person choosing the representative photos.
The same person picked the representative photo for all participants across both conditions.
As they did not know of the conditions of the study, nor the purpose of the photographs, this
was not expected to affect the choice.
Results
7. Page 6, line 10: More information is needed regarding within-rater differences. Were
here any differences in ratings as a function of age and/or sex of the rater versus age
and/or sex of the participant?
Please see response to Reviewer 1 above regarding sex of raters and subjects.
There were no effects of the age of the photographed subjects on any of the ratings. However,
he ages of the subjects were within a narrow range (with only two individuals above the age
of 30) and there may well be an interaction effect of sleep deprivation and age on social
perceptions that this study was not designed to capture.
The age of the raters did not affect the ratings.
8. Page 9, line 21-46: Further detail is needed about the results of the mediation analysis
as well as the methods used. The text as written suggests that the authors assessed the
effect of each characteristic (i.e., sleepiness, health, attractiveness, and trust)
ndependently and then added them together to find the overall mediated effect of
34.7%? However, although the authors indicate that they adjusted for the other
mediators, it is unclear how this adjustment was made. It appears that these factors are
all highly correlated with each other, and therefore this additive approach may be
overestimating the true overall mediated effect. Have you considered instead building a
multivariate model to determine how much of the variance is described by these four
characteristics, and whether one characteristic is the dominant factor?
This is exactly what we did. The sentence in question has been extended to the following for
clarification: (p.9, line 204-208) "When adjusting for the other mediators, through including
all of them simultaneously, together with sleep restriction, as predictors of willingness to
socialize in a multivariate model, 7.1% of the effect of sleep restriction on willingness to
socialize was mediated via sleepiness, 5.5% via health, 16.0% via attractiveness, and 6.1%

Figures
9. Figure 3: It is not clear from the figure legend which values represent Cohen's d and
which represent beta-weights. Please label these more clearly. It is also unclear what
"SOC" represents in this figure.
This has been clarified accordingly in the figure and figure legend. The variable "sociability"
has been changed from "SOC" to "Soc" in the figure to be more in line with the other
variables, and described more clearly in the figure legend. The values which represent
Cohen's d are now in italics in the figure to more clearly separate them from the beta-weights,
and this is also indicated in the figure legend.
