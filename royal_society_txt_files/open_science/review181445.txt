The paper describe the growth of (La, Li)TiO3 using the TSFZ method. LLT is a potential battery
material, and therefore I consider the present work timely and worth publishing. However, there
are few important points that authors should consider including in the manuscript to make it
more credible and useful:
1. Powder x-ray diffraction pattern of the successfully grown crystals (in Fig. 4) should be
included to confirm their crystal structure (this is important since the structure is governed by the
final Li concentration, and Li being volatile the final composition may differ from the starting
composition).
2. EDX or EPMA compositions (average value and standard deviation) of the successfully grown
crystals should be included.
3. It would be nice if AC conductivity of oxygen annealed crystals is also included.
4. Habit plane should be defined. It is not clear from the description given in paragraph 1 of
section 3.3 as to how the habit plane formation hinders the growth. However, the paragraph 2 is
clear where feeding speed is discussed. I will appreciate if paragraph 1 is also made more useful.
5. Figure 3 is not useful as it doesn't reveal much. You can however choose a picture showing the
habit planes. If such a picture is not available you can remove Fig. 3, as you will anyway have one
extra figure showing the powder XRD of the crystals.
6. No mention of Li evaporation during the growth? In my view, this is an important parameter
for reproducibility of these experiments. I suggest that this point be mentioned and discussed.

Dear authors,
This paper describes crystal growth of LLT by TSFZ method. They paid a lot of attention to
decomposition of the compound, incongruent melting, to achieve stable growth conditions. As a
result, they succeeded to obtain really bulk single crystals. I think this is a very good work in
terms of crystal growth.
To make this manuscript more interesting one for the readers, I encourage authors to add some
results and descriptions.
Authors mentioned, 'decrease the growth temperature to prevent Li evaporation from the molten
zone.' However, they did not disclose the effect of Li loss. It can be possible to estimate Li loss
during growth by measuring total weight of feed rod and obtained crystals. I know not only loss
of lithium but also oxygen deficiency is another cause of weight loss. However, rough estimation
of Li loss may be possible.
I suppose Li-loss is also an important fact relating to the authors claim. In order to conclude
incongruent melting, it is necessary to show that change of composition in molten zone was not
due to loss of lithium but due to incongruent melting. To mention about phase diagram, chemical
composition of the system must be kept constant during the process. Loss of lithium is a potential
cause for misleading of phase relationships. I do not know if the authors have results to mention
about Li loss during growth. However, I would like to ask the author to give quantitative or
qualitative estimation of Li-loss during growth process.
The conductivity is affected by the number of carrier and mobility. It seems that anisotropy in
conduction was more significant than the value reported in a literature. I suppose this is an
evidence for high quality of the crystal grown by the authors. However, it is not possible to
discuss conductivity in detail only from the results measured at room temperature. To give useful
information to readers, it is a good idea to show temperature dependence of conductivity.
Evaluation of the activation energy of conduction is necessary for understanding of the
conduction mechanism. As the quality of the crystal seems to be sufficiently high to evaluate
reliable physical parameters, I encourage the authors to work on temperature dependence
measurements.

The paper describe the growth of (La, Li)TiO3 using the TSFZ method.
LLT is a potential battery material, and therefore I consider the present
work timely and worth publishing. However, there are few important
points that authors should consider including in the manuscript to make it
more credible and useful:
1. Powder x-ray diffraction pattern of the successfully grown crystals
(in Fig. 4) should be included to confirm their crystal structure (this
is important since the structure is governed by the final Li
concentration, and Li being volatile the final composition may differ
from the starting composition).
<U+2192>We thank the referee for fruitful suggestions. We included the XRD
pattern of the grown crystal on Fig 4. We confirmed that the crystal
structure of grown crystal is a tetragonal double-perovskite structure. We
think that the final Li composition may differ from the starting
composition. However, we obtained LLT crystal with a tetragonal double-
perovskite structure.
We added following sentence in section 3.3:
Figure 4 shows the XRD patterns of the LLT feed rod sintered at 1300°C
for 12 h in air and the grown crystals. The XRD pattern of the grown
crystals is attributed to a tetragonal double-perovskite-type LLT. Thus, we
successfully obtained double-perovskite-type LLT crystals by TSFZ
method. The diffraction peaks of the grown crystals shifted to lower angle
than that of the feed rod. It had been reported that the LLT lattice expands
as the extra Li evaporation [21]. The peak shift in the grown crystals
agrees with the results of the quantitative analysis by EPMA. The
diffraction intensity due to the superstructure in the grown crystals was
high as compared with the sintered LLT. This indicates that the grown
crystals have a high crystallinity.
2. EDX or EPMA compositions (average value and standard
deviation) of the successfully grown crystals should be included.
<U+2192>Thank you for your suggestion. We included the EPMA compositions
(average and standard deviation).
We added the following sentences in section 3.3:
The chemical composition of the grown crystals was determined to be
La0.61±0.02Li0.17±0.006TiO3 (x=0.057±0.002) by quantitative analysis using
EPMA. The Li content in the grown crystals was lower than that in the
feed. The low Li content is due to evaporation of Li from the molten zone
during the crystal growth and a lower distribution coefficient of Li into
LLT.
We also added the experimental method of the quantitative analysis in
Section “Experimental Procedure” as follows;
Also the concentration of La and Ti in the grown crystals were determined
by quantitative analysis using a La2Ti2O7 single crystal as a standard
sample, and Li concentration 3x in the composition La2/3-xLi3xTiO3 was
estimated using atomic ratio La/Ti.
3. It would be nice if AC conductivity of oxygen annealed crystals is
also included.
<U+2192> As described the first sentence in section 3.4, the crystals for the
measurement were already annelid in oxygen. We added “ The crystals
were annealed in oxygen.” also in figure caption of Fig. 5.
4. Habit plane should be defined. It is not clear from the description
given in paragraph 1 of section 3.3 as to how the habit plane formation
hinders the growth. However, the paragraph 2 is clear where feeding
speed is discussed. I will appreciate if paragraph 1 is also made more
useful.
<U+2192>We deleted sentence in paragraph 1 of section 3.3 due to deletion of Fig.
3.
5. Figure 3 is not useful as it doesn't reveal much. You can however
choose a picture showing the habit planes. If such a picture is not
available you can remove Fig. 3, as you will anyway have one extra
figure showing the powder XRD of the crystals.
<U+2192>We removed Fig. 3. We changed Fig. 4 to Fig. 3. We added XRD pattern
of the crystals on Fig.4.
6. No mention of Li evaporation during the growth? In my view, this
is an important parameter for reproducibility of these experiments. I
suggest that this point be mentioned and discussed.
<U+2192>We agree with you and have incorporated this suggestion. From the
EPMA composition, Li composition in the grown crystals was lower than
the starting composition. The low Li content in the grown crystals is duo
to not only Li evaporation during growth also a low distribution
coefficient of Li into LLT. In general, the melt growth causes a decrease
of a solute into solid solution in the case of a distribution coefficient of a
solute into a solid solution lower than unity. We added data by quantitative
analysis, and mentioned the Li evaporation in section 3.3 as follows.
The chemical composition of the grown crystals was determined to be
La0.61±0.02Li0.17±0.006TiO3 (x=0.057±0.002) by quantitative analysis using
EPMA. The Li content in the grown crystals was lower than that in the
feed. The low Li content is due to evaporation of Li from the molten zone
during the crystal growth and a lower distribution coefficient of Li into
LLT.

<U+2192> We thank the referee for fruitful suggestions. We observed Li
vaporization during growth because a quartz tube around the growth
region becomes white by deposition of Li compound into the quartz tube
even though TSFZ growth.
We corrected “prevent” to “reduce” in the sentence which you suggested
as follows:
decrease the growth temperature to reduce Li evaporation from the molten
zone.
We also added the results of the quantitative analysis by EPMA in section
3.3 and discussed about Li vaporization as follows:
The chemical composition of the grown crystals was determined to be
La0.61±0.02Li0.17±0.006TiO3 (x=0.057±0.002) by quantitative analysis using
EPMA. The Li content in the grown crystals was lower than that in the

I suppose Li-loss is also an important fact relating to the authors claim.
In order to conclude incongruent melting, it is necessary to show that
change of composition in molten zone was not due to loss of lithium
but due to incongruent melting. To mention about phase diagram,
chemical composition of the system must be kept constant during the
process. Loss of lithium is a potential cause for misleading of phase
relationships. I do not know if the authors have results to mention
about Li loss during growth. However, I would like to ask the author
to give quantitative or qualitative estimation of Li-loss during growth
process.
<U+2192>Thank you for your suggestion. We measured chemical compositions
of the grown crystals by EPMA. We think that Li evaporate during the
crystal growth because Li composition in grown crystals differs from the
starting composition. We mentioned the chemical compositions of the
grown and Li evaporation in section 3.3.
The conductivity is affected by the number of carrier and mobility. It
seems that anisotropy in conduction was more significant than the
value reported in a literature. I suppose this is an evidence for high
quality of the crystal grown by the authors. However, it is not possible
to discuss conductivity in detail only from the results measured at

idea to show temperature dependence of conductivity. Evaluation of
the activation energy of conduction is necessary for understanding of
the conduction mechanism. As the quality of the crystal seems to be
sufficiently high to evaluate reliable physical parameters, I encourage
the authors to work on temperature dependence measurements.
<U+2192>We thank you for fruitful suggestions. Although we think that it is a
good idea to show temperature dependence of conductivity to give useful
information, we can not measure a temperature dependence of
conductivity because there is no equipment attached heater. However, we
work toward to evaluate the activation energy of conduction in the future
work.
