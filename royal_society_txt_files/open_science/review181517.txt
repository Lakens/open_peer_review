This work deals with the mathematical analysis of stability conditions of the disease-free
equilibrium in an eco-epidemiological model that describes the spread of a waterborne disease
through a networked system of populations.
In particular, the authors analyse the conditions under which a small perturbation of the system
(for instance the introduction of few infected individuals) can lead to transient epidemics or long
term endemic conditions.
The analysis is based on the concept of g-reactivity which has been introduced by the authors in
previous works.
Overall, the paper presents novel results that are sound and important for the scientific
community of mathematical ecologists and epidemiologists.
The g-reactivity framework is shown to be a powerful tool to understand the dynamics of
spatially explicit epidemic models.
The paper is definitively suitable for publication in the Royal Society Open Science.
I have only minor suggestions for revisions:
There is a distinction between the model described by equations (1) with and without the
addition of the OCN and the human mobility network. However, I found difficult to understand
where these two additional layers are included and where they are not. Is all the analysis of
sections 3-4 derived without considering the spatial networks above? I would suggest clarifying
this point with a few lines.
I would suggest adding a table summarising all the parameters of the model and the notation
used.
Does the assumption on the mobility model used (in this case the gravity model) affect the
results? Could you please add a comment on this?
Line 270, I guess there is a typo: Q_{ii}=0.
Code availability. Even if the authors state that sections 3 and 4 provide detailed instructions to
reproduce the results of section 5, I am sure there are several technical details in the
implementation of the model that are not obvious for a non-expert reader. It would be greatly
beneficial for researchers working on closely related problems to share the code used for this
work in a public repository. I am sure that sharing the code would also increase significantly the
impact of the manuscript.

The manuscript extends a previously published analytical approach to include complex spatial
models. This approach now allows one to identify conditions under which transient epidemics
could occur and to explore the spatial structure of the initial conditions that can generate such
epidemics.
The methods for analyzing the model are described well in Sections 3 and 4, the metapopulation
model itself is quite complex, with 500 populations linked by a river-like network. It would be
difficult for a reader to replicate the model and analysis. The methods here would be much more
useful if they were accompanied by code to generate the models and to analyze them, though I
am not sure this would be required by the journal. Journal policy is to share data and code
supporting the manuscript results (see the "Data sharing" section at
https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsos/for-reviewers).
Minor comments:
On first read, I had some trouble understanding the connection between reactivity in the
Introduction (page 4) and g-reactivity (page 5). I think defining g-reactivity early on page 5
would help (it is now first defined in Section 3 on page 8).
Line 388 (page 15) describes the long-term persistence of epidemics. Does that mean that a long-
term intervention targeting communities near the river outlet such as routine vaccination could
be most effective at preventing persistence?
Line 432 (page 19) notes that cholera outbreaks tend to start in coastal regions. It is interesting
that the asymptotic optimal perturbation to the model is not near the river outlet but in the
headwaters (Section 5.4).
I am having some trouble understanding the paragraph in the Discussion beginning on line 438
(page 20). The paragraph seems to be about the unstable disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and not
about the g-reactive stable DFE, so the relationship between Haiti and the analytical framework is
not clear.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The manuscript by Mari et al describes a network model that they used to evaluate the roles of
human mobility and water-borne transport in propagating and sustaining epidemics of water-
borne pathogens. The analysis appears to be technically sound (although I was not able to follow
all of the math) and is novel, although the authors overstate the applicability of their findings and
make a number of simplifying assumptions that make the work largely theoretical.
My main concern is that the authors repeatedly overstate the “realism” of their model and its
applicability to real-world epidemic surveillance and control. The model does not appear to be
based on or fitted to data for any particular pathogen or population. Furthermore, the model is
based on the classic SIR paradigm of a fully immunizing infection, and yet I do not believe there
is any water-borne pathogen that confers life-long immunity to reinfection. While an SIR model
structure may be useful for examining the invasion dynamics of a pathogen that confers
temporary immunity to reinfection in a fully susceptible population (as is reasonable for
modeling the initial introduction of cholera to Haiti, for example), here the authors are interested
in exploring the equilibrium dynamics of the system and occurrence of transient epidemics
and/or endemicity over longer timescales. As such, they should make explicit the assumption of
lifelong immunity and discuss the potential implications and limitations of this assumption.
Lastly, the manuscript is written for a highly technical audience, and would not be accessible to
an audience that could actually translate the findings into actual practical use, e.g. the planning of
interventions or design of surveillance systems, as suggested on p. 19. It may be more useful to
discuss how their approach might be incorporated into or used to inform models fitted to real
data that could actually be validated in some way.
Minor comments:
p. 3, line 20: Replace “in general” with “generally”.
p. 3, lines 24-30: Rotavirus, which is the leading cause of mortality from diarrhea in children, is
generally not considered to be primarily waterborne. It is still a leading cause of diarrhea in
5
developed countries with improved water and sanitation (prior to vaccine introduction), and
epidemics tend to peak during the dry season in most countries throughout the world. Therefore,
it should not be mentioned as an example of a waterborne infection, nor should it be implied that
most diarrheal disease is “clearly” attributable to unsafe water.
p. 7, lines 126-130: I believe it would be more accurate to refer to the parameter m_i as the fraction
of time that mobile individuals living in i spend outside of their own community. Otherwise, it
sounds as those this fraction of (discrete) individuals are always elsewhere (in communities other
than i), which does not make sense.
p. 9, line 189: Replace “work” with “worth”.
p. 19, line 425: Replace “timely set up” with “set up in a timely manner”.
p. 19, line 426: Replace “stroke” with “struck”.
p. 19, line 436: Replace “forecast” with “forecasting”.
Data accessibility: The code for the model should be shared, either as supplementary material or
in a repository such as github.

Conditions for transient epidemics of waterborne disease
in spatially explicit systems

Point-by-point Authors’ answers to Referees’ comments

Referee #1
.1] This work deals with the mathematical analysis of stability conditions of the disease-free equi-
ium in an eco-epidemiological model that describes the spread of a waterborne disease through
etworked system of populations. In particular, the authors analyse the conditions under which a
ll perturbation of the system (for instance the introduction of few infected individuals) can lead
ransient epidemics or long term endemic conditions. The analysis is based on the concept of g-
ctivity which has been introduced by the authors in previous works. Overall, the paper presents
el results that are sound and important for the scientific community of mathematical ecologists
epidemiologists. The g-reactivity framework is shown to be a powerful tool to understand the
amics of spatially explicit epidemic models. The paper is definitively suitable for publication in
Royal Society Open Science. I have only minor suggestions for revisions.
thank this referee for her/his excellent summary and positive assessment of our work.
.2] There is a distinction between the model described by equations (1) with and without the
ition of the OCN and the human mobility network. However, I found difficult to understand
re these two additional layers are included and where they are not. Is all the analysis of sections
derived without considering the spatial networks above? I would suggest clarifying this point with
w lines.
disease transmission model is presented in equations (1) in its most general formulation, i.e. accounting
both local and spatial processes. All of the analyses described in sections 3 and 4, as well as the numerical
lts presented in section 5, refer to this formulation. Human mobility and hydrological transport of
hogens can be ‘shut down’ by setting mSi = mIi = 0 and li = 0 for all i’s, respectively. This actually
duces a set of disconnected local models, which is the case shown as thin gray lines in Figure 2. We
1
nowledge that the relationship between the full spatial model and its spatially-implicit counterpart was
tioned only in the caption of Figure 2. We have therefore added a few lines of explanation in the main
about this important point (p. 8, ll. 159–163 in the revised manuscript). Thanks for pointing out this
ential source of misunderstandings.
.3] I would suggest adding a table summarising all the parameters of the model and the notation
d.
able summarizing all the variables and parameters of the model has been added (Table 1, p. 32). Thanks
the suggestion.
.4] Does the assumption on the mobility model used (in this case the gravity model) affect the
ults? Could you please add a comment on this?
ifferent mobility model could be easily accommodated within the formalism of model (1), provided that
an mobility may be expressed in terms of movement probability (as quantified by the parameters mSi
mIi ) and trip distribution (e.g. in the form of an origin-destination matrix, as quantified by matrix Q).
hing would change in this case from the perspective of the analytical derivation of the conditions for
hogen endemicity or short-term outbreaks. Clearly, however, numerical results might differ considerably,
also demonstrated by the numerical experiment shown in Figure 3b, where wide ranges of variation
the parameters of the gravity model (corresponding to different human mobility patterns) have been
sidered. We have revised our manuscript to include these comment (p. 14, ll. 292–294).
.5] Line 270, I guess there is a typo: Qii = 0.
rected, thanks (p. 14 l. 289).
.6] Code availability. Even if the authors state that sections 3 and 4 provide detailed instructions to
roduce the results of section 5, I am sure there are several technical details in the implementation of
model that are not obvious for a non-expert reader. It would be greatly beneficial for researchers
king on closely related problems to share the code used for this work in a public repository. I am
e that sharing the code would also increase significantly the impact of the manuscript.
nks for raising this point. Following this Reviewer’s suggestion (and similar ones by the other two
erees as well, see below) we have included a MATLAB implementation of the instructions required to
uate epidemicity and endemicity conditions, as well as to perform numerical simulations of our model,

understand the concern raised by this Reviewer, and we agree that implementing from scratch the

nks for the remark. A short definition of g-reactivity is now provided when the concept is first introduced

s is an interesting observation. For sure, the fact that the outlet and the river stretches closest to it
where most of the cases are expected over relatively long time scales suggests that this region requires
nsified surveillance (as already noted in the original manuscript; see p. 19, ll. 429–435) and likely
lifies as an intervention hotspot (as now highlighted in the revised manuscript; see p. 21, ll. 472–473).
wever, we refrain from stating that interventions geographically targeted to the outlet region would be
mal for the prevention of sustained disease transmission, because drawing such a conclusion would
uire an in-depth exploration of different spatial prioritization options for the deployment of health-care
urces – something, we feel, that goes beyond the scope of this work.

nks for the annotation. We have added a comment to emphasize the role possibly played by the
tream sections of the river network in the development of transient outbreaks (p. 21, ll. 473–475).
.5] I am having some trouble understanding the paragraph in the Discussion beginning on line 438
ge 20). The paragraph seems to be about the unstable disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and not
ut the g-reactive stable DFE, so the relationship between Haiti and the analytical framework is
clear.
eed, that paragraph is mostly concerned with an intrinsic limitation of the g-reactivity framework in
presence of an asymptotically unstable DFE (or any unstable equilibrium point of a generic system of
nary differential equations for that matter). In that case, in fact, the exponential divergence of the
em trajectories from the unstable equilibrium would cause linearization (a staple of both linear stability
g-reactivity analyses) to fail rapidly, thus making any predictions drawn from g-reactiviy less relevant
the problem under study. However, we maintain that performing g-reactivity and stability analyses can
useful to better understand the role played by different risk factors in the definition of transmission
amics over a range of time scales. We have slightly rephrased the paragraph (p. 21, ll. 461–465) to
rove its readability.
Referee #3
.1] The manuscript by Mari et al describes a network model that they used to evaluate the roles
uman mobility and water-borne transport in propagating and sustaining epidemics of water-borne
hogens. The analysis appears to be technically sound (although I was not able to follow all of
math) and is novel, although the authors overstate the applicability of their findings and make a
ber of simplifying assumptions that make the work largely theoretical.
agree with this Reviewer that the results presented in this work are mainly theoretical in their spirit. Let
ust note, however, that in spite of all its limitations, model (1) has been quite successfully applied to
ual epidemic outbreaks, as also pointed out in the original version of the manuscript (p. 6, ll. 107–111).
are thus confident that at least some of the results presented in this work may apply as well to real-world
e studies.
.2] My main concern is that the authors repeatedly overstate the “realism” of their model and its
licability to real-world epidemic surveillance and control. The model does not appear to be based
4
or fitted to data for any particular pathogen or population.
respectfully disagree on this point. The biological parameters of model (1) are in fact taken from a
dy (Bertuzzo et al., 2016) where the model was calibrated against actual case reports from the cholera
emic that struck Haiti at the end of 2010, as explained in the caption of Figure 2 (p. 30, l. 690 of the
inal manuscript). We have revised the manuscript to make clear that, despite its apparent generality,
del (1) is actually best suited to describe cholera transmission dynamics (p. 5, ll. 97–98; p. 6, ll. 111–
). Also, the landscape structure used for the numerical examples described in this work has been
e often analyzed in other epidemiological applications for its resemblance to actual fluvial systems. A
ment on this point has been added to the revised version of the manuscript (p. 13, ll. 264–266).
.3] Furthermore, the model is based on the classic SIR paradigm of a fully immunizing infection, and
I do not believe there is any water-borne pathogen that confers life-long immunity to reinfection.
ile an SIR model structure may be useful for examining the invasion dynamics of a pathogen
t confers temporary immunity to reinfection in a fully susceptible population (as is reasonable for
deling the initial introduction of cholera to Haiti, for example), here the authors are interested
xploring the equilibrium dynamics of the system and occurrence of transient epidemics and/or
emicity over longer timescales. As such, they should make explicit the assumption of lifelong
munity and discuss the potential implications and limitations of this assumption.
g-reactivity and stability thresholds analyzed in this work refer to the DFE of model (1). In a disease-
condition, by definition, the whole host population is assumed to be in a susceptible state. For this
on, deciding whether loss of immunity from recovered individual should be included in the model is
aterial. This was briefly mentioned in the original version of the manuscript at p. 7, ll. 135–138. That
ment has now been emphasized as suggested by this Referee (p. 7, ll. 139–142). We also note that
nt estimates from the Haiti cholera epidemic place the duration of acquired immunity in the range
–3.0 years (Pasetto et al., 2018). As such, immunity loss is unlikely to influence the temporal dynamics
isease transmission over relatively short time scales, e.g. like those used for the simulations of Figure 4.
omment on this point has been added to the revised version of the manuscript (pp. 7–8, ll. 142–144).
.4] Lastly, the manuscript is written for a highly technical audience, and would not be accessible
n audience that could actually translate the findings into actual practical use, e.g. the planning
nterventions or design of surveillance systems, as suggested on p. 19. It may be more useful to
uss how their approach might be incorporated into or used to inform models fitted to real data
t could actually be validated in some way.
agree that the manuscript is pretty technical, especially in sections 3 and 4. We believe, however,
t the numerical examples shown in section 5 may appeal a wider audience, and special care has been
5
oted to make sure that their description (along with the accompanying Discussion section) is accessible
eaders with a less quantitative background. We anticipate that, in the same spirit, we have also included
he revision a simple MATLAB script that shows how to perform epidemicity and endemicity analysis
h our model in a step-by-step fashion (see comment R3.12 below and similar remarks made by the other
iewers). For the comment on the applicability of our framework to a model that can be fitted to real
a, please refer to the answer to point R3.2 above.
.5] Minor comments: p. 3, line 20: Replace “in general” with “generally”.
e, thanks (p. 3, l. 20).
.6] p. 3, lines 24-30: Rotavirus, which is the leading cause of mortality from diarrhea in children, is
erally not considered to be primarily waterborne. It is still a leading cause of diarrhea in developed
ntries with improved water and sanitation (prior to vaccine introduction), and epidemics tend to
k during the dry season in most countries throughout the world. Therefore, it should not be
ntioned as an example of a waterborne infection, nor should it be implied that most diarrheal
ase is “clearly” attributable to unsafe water.
nks for the comment. We have revised the paragraph at p. 3, ll. 23–29.
.7] p. 7, lines 126-130: I believe it would be more accurate to refer to the parameter mi as the
tion of time that mobile individuals living in i spend outside of their own community. Otherwise,
ounds as those this fraction of (discrete) individuals are always elsewhere (in communities other
n i), which does not make sense.
eed. We have modified the description of the parameter accordingly (p. 7, ll. 130–132; see also p. 8,
50–152, and p. 11, ll. 210–212). Thanks for raising this point.

e, thanks (p. 21, l. 476).
.12] Data accessibility: The code for the model should be shared, either as supplementary material
n a repository such as github.
owing this comments and similar ones made by the other two Reviewers, we have included a MATLAB
lementation of the instructions required to evaluate the stability and g-reactivity properties of the
del described in this work in a new section of the ESM (Appendix C, pp. 7–11). Thanks for this sensible
gestion.
onclusion, we wish to thank the editors for giving us the opportunity to revise our manuscript, and the
e reviewers for their useful comments that indeed helped us improve our work.
