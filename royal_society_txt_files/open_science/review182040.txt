The paper is suitable for the journal and reports an experimental investigation of thermophysical
properties of ionanofluids. In addition, heat transfer performance in falling film flow on a
horizontal tube is also performed.
At this stage, the paper requires amendments and clarifications before possible publication. All
comments and questions to consider are here listed:
Precise if data of Table 1 come from the manufacturer or were evaluated by the authors.
For GNs, indicate if data come from the manufacturer or were evaluated by the authors. In the
second case explain how they have been evaluated.
Indicate the type of device used for ultrasonication, brand, power, frequency, temperature.
Measurements methods have to be better described to make the work reproducible. In particular,
include measured uncertainties with calibration fluids, for viscosity measurement give the type of
geometry used, their dimensions, measurement has to be performed under steady-state
conditions, without measurements are not reliable. Flow curves must be shown, not only the
viscosity values to evidence the Newtonian behavior (or not).
eq2 is defined for spheres; GNs do not have this shape consequently this model is not
scientifically relevant.
Eq5 does not give any physical insight, to remove, eq6 is sufficient and well predicted the data.
Where come from the density value of table 4?
To be relevant, the comparison of local heat coefficient in figure 15 must be performed
considering uncertainty analysis of all experimental parameters.

Response to Referees
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you very much for your great contribution and for the reviewers' comments concerning
our manuscript entitled "Variations of thermophysical properties and heat transfer performance of
nanoparticle-enhanced ionic liquids "(ID: RSOS-182040). Those comments are all valuable and
very helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding significance to
our researchers. We have studied all comments carefully and have made correction comprehensively
in hope of meeting approval. Revised portions are marked in red in the paper. Furthermore, each
comments of two reviewers is listed below and is followed by our response and revision one by one
in blue.
Reviewer #1:
Q1: It should be " To improve the thermal conduction " in Row 23 in Page 1. Please check it.
A1: Thanks for your correction. We have modified this sentence according to the reviewer's
suggestion.
Q2: “The variation…..” should be " The variations….." in Row 25 in Page 1.
A2: Thanks for your correction. We have modified this sentence according to the reviewer's
suggestion.
Q3: “was then measured over a wide range…..” should be " were then measured over wide
ranges….." in Row 26 in Page 1.
A3: Thanks for your correction. We have modified this sentence according to the reviewer's
suggestion.
Q4: “improved with increasing mass fraction” should be " increased with increasing mass
fraction " in Row 29 in Page 1.
A4: Thanks for your correction. We have modified this sentence according to the reviewer's
suggestion.
Q5: “refrigeration, which” should be " refrigeration that" in Row 36 in Page 1.
A5: Thanks for your correction. We have modified this sentence according to the reviewer's
suggestion.
Q6: “efficiency, to” should be "efficiency to " in Row 109 in Page 6.
A6: Thanks for your correction. We have modified this sentence according to the reviewer's
suggestion.
Q7: The grammar of the sentence “In an absorption refrigerator, the refrigerants from the
evaporator are absorbed by and desorbed from the absorbents in the absorber and desorber,
respectively, which are exothermic and endothermic processes.” in Row 38-39 of page 1 may
be incorrect.
A7: Thanks for your valuable suggestion. We have re-written this sentence according to the
reviewer's suggestion in the revised manuscript as follow:
In an absorption refrigerator, the absorber takes in the refrigerant from the evaporator and
thereafter releases it to the condenser in the desorber accompanied by exothermic and
endothermic effects.
Q8: Please provide the meshing tool and the version of the Fluent.
A8: Thanks for your valuable suggestion. As you suggested, the meshing tool and the version of the
Fluent were added in the revised manuscript as follow:
Considering that the most frequently used flow mode in the absorber and desorber units is falling
film flow on a horizontal tube and its symmetrical structure, the physical model of falling film flow
on half of the horizontal tube based on Gambit is depicted in Fig. 3.
The volume of fluid (VOF) model was selected for the simulations, which were performed using
the Fluent software (version 6.3.26).
Q9: The reference No. in Figure should be [22] according to your statement.
A9: Thanks for your correction. We are very sorry for our incorrect writing. As the reviewer #2
suggested, the sources of the data listed in Table 1 are added and indicated in the revised
manuscript. The reference No. in figure 15 was modified to [25] according to the statement in
the revised manuscript as follow:
Figure 4 shows a comparison of the local heat transfer coefficient of water between the present
results and the reference results[25].

results.
The serial number of remaining references has been updated in the revised version.
Q10: Have you considered the mass transfer in your simulation? If ‘no’, it did not match the
absorption condition.
A10: Thanks for your valuable suggestion. In fact, we did not consider the mass transfer in our
simulation. As is said in the introduction, during a practical absorption refrigeration cycle, the
processes of absorption by and desorption from the absorbent are often performed under
cooling and heating, respectively. The cooling and heating efficiency directly affects the
absorption and desorption efficiency. Therefore, it would be of great value to enhance the
thermal conductivity of ionic liquid absorbents such as [EMIm]Ac to improve its transport
transport properties that influence the heat transfer. This manuscript mainly concerned the
variations of thermophysical properties and heat transfer performance of the nanoparticle-
enhanced ionic liquids. The coupled heat and mass transfer is not conducive to the direct
analysis of the variations of thermophysical properties on heat transfer performance, because
of that the mass transfer process is accompanied by the changes in the physicochemical
properties of liquid film and the absorption and release of heat. So the mass transfer is not
considered in my simulation. The suggestion is meaningful. We will consider the improved
thermal conductivity with nanoparticles on mass transfer performance in our future research.
Q11: Please provide the numerical model such as governing equations.
A11: Considering the reviewer's valuable suggestion, the governing equations of the numerical
model was added in the revised manuscript as follow:
The governing equations can be expressed as follows[25]
<U+F0D1>(u) <U+F03D> 0 (1)
<U+F0B6> ( <U+F072> u)
<U+F02B> <U+F0D1>( <U+F072> u <U+F0D7> u) <U+F03D> <U+F0D1>( <U+F06D><U+F0D1>u) <U+F02D> <U+F0D1>( p) <U+F02B> <U+F072> g <U+F02B> F (2)

<U+F0B6>t cp
Where u is the velocity vector, <U+03C1>g is the gravitational force, F is the external body force of
surface tension, T is temperature.
Q12: In Section 3.4, the liquid inlet is better to be a slot instead of a hole due to the present two
dimensions domain.
A12: Thanks for your correction. We have modified this sentence according to your suggestion. The
liquid inlet was modified to a slot.
Q13: Please explain the grate deviation between the measured data and the Batchelor model in Fig.8.
A13: Thanks for your valuable suggestion. As suggested by the reviewer #2 that, the Batchelor
model is defined for spheres; GNs have sheet structure. So the Batchelor model is not
scientifically relevant. For graphene nanoplatelet, Sarsam[1] studied the thermophysical
properities of water-based nanofluids containing triethanolamine-treated graphene
nanoplatelets (TEA-GNP). The measured values of viscosity at 30 and 40 <U+25E6>C for the TEA-GNP
750 nanofluids were compared with the classical models of Einstein, Brinkman, and Batchelor
show in Fig.1. A larger deviation is also seen in Fig.1. Considering the relatively large deviation,
He developed a correlation by modifying the factor in the original Einstein model for spheres
from a value of 2.5 to a fitted value of 550 that represents the TEA-GNPs of this study.
Fig.1 Comparison between the measured values of viscosity for different weight concentrations
of water-based TEA-GNP 750 nanofluids at (a) 30 <U+25E6>C and (b) 40 <U+25E6>C with the classical models
for viscosity of Einstein, Brinkman, and Batchelor and with the suggested correlation.
Considering the reviewer's valuable suggestion, we added the comparison between the
measured values of viscosity with the classical models of Einstein, Brinkman not only the
Batchelor model. A suggested correlation was also developed. The part in the manuscript have
been modified as follow:
Furthermore, the measured values of viscosity were compared with the classical models of
Einstein, Brinkman, Batchelor [27] and a suggested correlation was developed by modifying
the factor in the original Einstein model for spheres from a value of 2.5 to a fitted value of 1.1
shown in Fig.8, which can well represents the GNPs in our study except at a lower mass
fraction (with maximum deviation of 9.5%) due to a dominant self-lubrication effect of GNPs
at lower mass fractions[26].

Q14: It is confused that the variation of local heat transfer coefficient with peripheral angle in Fig.
4 is fluent but fluctuated strongly in Fig.15.
A14: Thanks for your valuable suggestion. In fact, Fig.4 was used to verify the reliability of the
model in this paper with the reference [25] in the manuscript. The working media and boundary
conditions of the liquid film flow rate on one side of the tube per unit length G and thermal
condition for the cases in Fig. 4 and Fig.15 are different. Due to the unique physical properties
of larger viscosity for ionic liquids, the liquid film flow rate G for the cases in Fig.15 was 0.3
kg·m-1·s-1 which is larger than that of water in Fig.4. (G=0.168 kg·m-1·s-1); and the thermal
condition is constant heat flux and constant wall temperature, respectively, for the cases in Fig.
4 and Fig.15. The fluctuation is also seen for certain cases in reference [25] shown in Fig.1.
Fig.1 Local heat transfer coefficient versus peripheral angle under different tube diameters.
In the manuscript, the local heat transfer coefficient is calculated when the computation reaches
stability. Considering the reviewer's valuable suggestion, the local heat transfer coefficient is
time-averaged according to reference [25] to reduce the fluctuation, and the result is shown in
Fig.15. The different boundary conditions were added and indicated in the Fig.4 and Fig.15.
The description for Fig.15 in the manuscript is modified as follow:

Q17: “Variation” should be “Variations” in the title.
A17: Thanks for your correction. We are very sorry for our incorrect writing. We have modified
this sentence according to your suggestion.
Q18: Why the effect of temperature was not reflected in each fitted correlation. After all, the
variations of thermal properties with temperature have been concerned.
A18: Thanks for your valuable suggestion. Given the small change of thermal conductivity with
increasing temperature, we provide the fitted correlation for viscosity and specific heat capacity
neglecting that for the thermal conductivity. Considering the reviewer's suggestion, the fitted
correlation between the thermal conductivity and temperature is added in the revised
manuscript as follow:
In addition, a linear equation (Eq.(10)) was used to fit the experimentally measured thermal
conductivity data. Table 3 summarized the values of the fitting parameters B0 and B1 for the
various mass fractions.

Reviewer #2:
Q1: Precise if data of Table 1 come from the manufacturer or were evaluated by the authors.
A1: Thanks for your valuable suggestion. The data of Table 1 were evaluated in this work and the
measurement methods were illustrated in Sec.3.3. As you suggested, the data sources were
indicated in Table 1 and some description in the manuscript is modified as follow:
[EMIm]Ac (purity=98%, water content=1%) was purchased from the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical
Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The structural formula of [EMIm]Ac is depicted in Fig. 1
and its thermophysical properties measured in this work at the standard temperature of 293.15 K are
summarized in Table 1. The minor deviations in certain physical properties were ascribed to the
different manufacturing processes used by different suppliers.

Q2: For GNs, indicate if data come from the manufacturer or were evaluated by the authors. In the
second case explain how they have been evaluated.
A2: Thanks for your valuable suggestion. The data for GNs come from the manufacturer and we
have indicated the data sources in the manuscript as follow:
The GNPs exhibited a thermal conductivity of 3,000 W·m-1·K-1, a diameter of 5–10 µm, a thickness
of 4–20 nm and a density of 0.6 g·cm-3 and consisted of less than 20 layers (the data come from the
manufacturer).
Q3: Indicate the type of device used for ultrasonication, brand, power, frequency, temperature.
A3: Thanks for your valuable suggestion. Considering the Reviewer's suggestion, the type of device
used for ultrasonication, brand, power, frequency, temperature were added in the revised
manuscript as follows:
Various mass fractions of the GNPs were dispersed in [EMIm]Ac using a constant temperature
magnetic stirrer for 60 min followed ultrasonication for 60 min at 25<U+2103> by ultrasonic cleaning
machine (C15, XIERBAO, Beijing, power: 300W, frequency: 40KHz) for 60 min, affording INFs
with mass fractions of 0.05%,0.1%, 0.3%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4% and 5%.
Q4: Measurements methods have to be better described to make the work reproducible. In particular,
include measured uncertainties with calibration fluids, for viscosity measurement give the type
of geometry used, their dimensions, measurement has to be performed under steady-state
conditions, without measurements are not reliable. Flow curves must be shown, not only the
viscosity values to evidence the Newtonian behavior (or not).
A4: Thanks for your valuable suggestion. In this paper, the shear rate of 500 1/s was selected to
avoid the Taylor vortices area for steady-state shear testing. As you suggested, the measured
uncertainties with calibration fluids, the type of geometry used and their dimensions for
viscosity measurement, a figure about the flow curves and some description were added in the
revised manuscript as follows:
Thermal conductivities were evaluated using a laser thermal conductivity meter (LFA 467,
NETZSCH, Germany) by the flash method over the temperature range of 293.15–373.15K.
Pyroceram 9606 provided by the supplier was used to calibrated the meter with a relative uncertainty
of 3% . Viscosities were measured using a viscotester (Viscotester iQ, HAAKE, Germany) over the
temperature range of 283.15–373.15 K. The viscotester was calibrated by the
standard viscosity liquid provided by the supplier with a relative uncertainty of 0.65%. The torque
resolution is 0.01 mN·m. The type of geometry used is cylinder double-gap (inner cvlinder: inner
diameter and outer diameter is 20.810 mm and 21.281 mm; outer cvlinder: inner diameter and outer
diameter is 26.594 mm and 27.200 mm; height: 40mm; distance: 4mm; volume: 3cm3). The shear
rate of 500 1/s was selected to avoid the Taylor vortices area for steady-state shear testing.
Specific heat capacities were determined using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC214Polyma,
Co. NETZSCH, Germany) based on the sapphire method over the temperature range of 303.15–
383.15 K. This was calibrated using Sapphire provided by the supplier with a relative uncertainty
of 0.5%. Thermal stabilities were analyzed using the same differential scanning calorimeter as above,
and the samples were heated from -50 °C to 350 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min under a nitrogen
atmosphere. Densities were measured using a densimeter (DMA5000M-Lovis200M, Anton Paar
Co.Austria). This was calibrated using air and ultra pure water provided by Anton Paar GmbH and
compared with values reported in the densimeter instruction manual. The found uncertainty was
less than ±1·10-5 g·cm-3 and the accuracy is 5×10-6 g·cm-3.
The shear stress are plotted in Fig.6 (a) as a function of shear rate for the samples within the
shear rate range of 1 1/s–500 1/s at 293.15 K. From which, it can be found that the behavior of
ionanofluids were quite Newtonian when the mass fraction of GNPs is lower than 0.5%.
However, the behavior of ionanofluids were quite non-Newtonian when the mass fraction of
GNPs is larger than 0.5%. The variation of the natural logarithm of the viscosity (tested with a
shear rate of 500 1/s) of the BL and the INFs with mass fractions of 0.05%,0.3%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%,
3% and 5% as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 6 (b).

The serial number of remaining figures has been updated in the revised version.
Q5: eq2 is defined for spheres; GNs do not have this shape consequently this model is not
scientifically relevant.
A5: Thanks for your valuable suggestion. It is really true as reviewer suggested that, the Batchelor
model is defined for spheres; for graphene nanoplatelet, Sarsam[1] studied the thermophysical
properities of water-based nanofluids containing triethanolamine-treated graphene
nanoplatelets(TEA-GNP). The measured values of viscosity at 30 and 40 <U+25E6>C for the TEA-GNP
750 nanofluids were compared with the classical models of Einstein, Brinkman, and Batchelor
show in Fig.1. Considering the relatively large deviation, he developed a correlation by
modifying the factor in the original Einstein model for spheres from a value of 2.5 to a fitted
value of 550 that represents the TEA-GNPs of this study.

for viscosity of Einstein, Brinkman, and Batchelor and with the suggested correlation.
Considering the reviewer's valuable suggestion, we added the comparison between the
measured values of viscosity with the classical models of Einstein, Brinkman, not only the
Batchelor model. A suggested correlation was also developed. The part in the manuscript have
been modified as follow:
Furthermore, the measured values of viscosity were compared with the classical models of
Einstein, Brinkman, Batchelor [27] and a suggested correlation was developed by modifying
the factor in the original Einstein model for spheres from a value of 2.5 to a fitted value of 1.1
shown in Fig.8, which can well represents the GNPs in our study except at a lower mass
fraction (with maximum deviation of 9.5%) due to a dominant self-lubrication effect of GNPs
at lower mass fractions[26].

Q6: Eq5 does not give any physical insight, to remove, eq6 is sufficient and well predicted the data.
A6: Thanks for your valuable suggestion. Maybe Eq.5 does not give a novel physical insight, but it
had been hoped to quantitatively bridge the experimental measured specific heat capacity for
the [EMIm]Ac-based ionanofluids (with addition of GNP) and the temperature. Eq.6 is classic
theoretical model for ionanofluids concerning the volume fraction of nanoparticle while
neglecting the temperature. So the Eq.5 is retained in our opinion.
Q7: Where come from the density value of table 4?
A7: Thanks for your valuable suggestion. The density is evaluated in this paper using a densimeter
(DMA5000M-Lovis200M, Anton Paar Co.Austria). The density measurement method is added
in the Sec. 3.3 in the revised manuscript as follow:
Densities were measured using a densimeter (DMA5000M-Lovis200M, Anton Paar
Co.Austria). This was calibrated using air and ultra pure water provided by Anton Paar GmbH
and compared with values reported in the densimeter instruction manual. The found uncertainty
was less than ±1·105 g·cm-3 and the accuracy is 5×106 g·cm-3.
The number of the table is modified to table 5 because of the addition of the table of "Fitting
parameters for the thermal conductivity data". The description for the table is modified in the
revised manuscript as follow:
The properties of the working medium measured in this work are summarized in Table 5.
Q8: To be relevant, the comparison of local heat coefficient in figure 15 must be performed
considering uncertainty analysis of all experimental parameters.
A8: Thanks for your valuable suggestion. In fact, the local heat coefficient for the ionanofluids in
figure 15 is by numerical calculation. So the uncertainty analysis of all experimental
parameters is not considered. The reliability of the numerical model is verified in Sec.3.4.
Considering the reviewer's valuable suggestion, the uncertainty analysis of all experimental
parameters were added in the Sec. 3.3 and the error bars in the figures were also added.
Q9: minor comments: include error bars in figures
A9: Thanks for your valuable suggestion. As you suggested,the measured error bars were added;
and due to the wide range of y-coordinate for the viscosity and thermal conductivity, the detail
view of the error bar is also given in the figure 6 (c) and figure 9. The measured error bars were
added in the revised manuscript as follow:
