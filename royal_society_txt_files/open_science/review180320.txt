In this paper, the authors studied the primary biocompatibility of nanocarriers which has been
reported previously. Throughout full text of this article, the evidence proposed by the author
legitimately proves that the PLGA-(PLO/fucoidan)4 NPs have better biocompatibility. However,
some points needed to be addressed.
1. The method of preparing the carrier should be briefly described when citation reference 14.
2. In section 4, provide some optimization for such a system.
3. Explain the sources of the methods 2.4 and 2.5.
4. The icon fonts “a” and “b’ in Figure 4, 5 and 9 are inconsistent with other figures.
5. It is recommended to convert formula 1 and 2 into an editable form.

This manuscript reports on the biocompatibility of the PLGA-(PLO/Fucoidan)4 NPs which has
the potential applications in the drug carrier field. The topic are much interesting, and some good
results were achieved. I suggest the manuscript be accepted, however, a few revisions are
required.
1. In section 3.2, no evidence of particle breakage despite the fact that the particles were easily
agglomerated by electrostatic interaction, please confirm the information.
2. In section 3.4.2, Is it possible to explain the reason that “At the same time, the addition of LbL
NPs inhibited proliferation more efficiency than the addition of PLGA NPs’ and ‘The cytotoxicity
of PLO was weakened by PEGylation”.
3. In Fig. 6. Please revise the label position and size of the figure.

4. In section 3.6, “Hemolysis test results illustrate that the polyelectrolyte material is wrapped to
help improve the biocompatibility of PLGA” have conflict with the statement “the addition of
LbL NPs inhibited proliferation more efficiency than the addition of PLGA NPs”, please confirm
the statement.
5. Relating to conclusion, recommend appropriate increase of reference.
6. Please check Fig 8. Four ligands were shown, however, only three color columns were shown.
7. I Suggest the authors consider the organization of Fig 3. Maybe you can set the three curves in
one Figure.

Response to Reviewers
Dear Editor,
Royal Society Open Science
Re: Manuscript ID: RSOS-180320
We would like to submit the revised manuscript entitled “Primary
biocompatibility tests of poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-(poly-L-orithine/fucoidan) core-
shell nanocarriers” (Manuscript ID: RSOS-180320). We wish it to be considered for
publication in the journal “Royal Society Open Science”. No conflict of interest
exists in the submission of this manuscript and is approved by all authors for
publication. I promise on behalf of all co-authors that the described work has neither
been published nor submitted for publication elsewhere.
The authors highly appreciate the valuable comments and suggestions from
reviewers during the peer-review process. We have carefully revised the manuscript
according to their suggestions. Our replies and explanation point to point to each of
the reviewer's comments are as given below, and the changes were highlighted in the
manuscript.
Reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer #1:
1. The method of preparing the carrier should be briefly described when citation
reference 14.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the constructive suggestion. We have now
added the method for preparing the carrier under the “Materials” in the experimental
section, and the respective text was highlighted in the manuscript.
“LbL self-assembled nanoparticles were prepared as previously described [14].
Briefly, the PLGA NPs were prepared by O/W emulsion-solvent evaporation method,
and then PLO and fucoidan were deposited layer by layer alternatively on the surface
of the substrate core by electrostatic interaction.”
2. In section 4, provide some optimization for such a system.
Response: Thank you very much for the valuable suggestion. We have now added
some optimization for such a system in the manuscript. Thanks.
“Now, LbL self-assembly technology has a lot of application prospects in cancer
treatment, especially in the optimization of such a system. For example, with material
modification, co-delivery multiple chemotherapeutic drugs or gene, as well as in
conjunction with target ligands, LbL nanocarrier can be significantly optimized.
Better biocompatibility and anti-tumor efficacy will be improved with optional
materials matching and structure adjustment.”.
3. Explain the sources of the methods 2.4 and 2.5.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comment and apologize for the
inconvenience caused during the peer-review process. We have supported the sources
of the methods 2.4 and 2.5. The revised section are as follows”.
“A simple and sensitive gas chromatographic method has been developed and
validated for detection of residual organic solvents [15].
“The cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) method was used to determine the cytotoxicity
[16]”.
4. The icon fonts “a” and “b’ in Figure 4, 5 and 9 are inconsistent with other figures.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comment and apologize for the
format error because of our careless, we have unified the icon font format of all
pictures.
5. It is recommended to convert formula 1 and 2 into an editable form.
Response: Thank you very much for the good advice. We have converted formula 1
and 2 into an editable form according to your suggestion.
Reviewer #2:
1. In section 3.2, no evidence of particle breakage despite the fact that the particles
were easily agglomerated by electrostatic interaction, please confirm the
information.
Response: Thank you very much for the comment. We are sorry for the confusing
description, and we have modified the description in the revision.
“The results indicated that the particles exhibited good mechanical properties in
saline, with a low swelling rate and no evidence of particle breakage, which showed
the stability and potential application in the drug delivery system”
2. In section 3.4.2, Is it possible to explain the reason that “At the same time, the
addition of LbL NPs inhibited proliferation more efficiency than the addition of
PLGA NPs’ and ‘The cytotoxicity of PLO was weakened by PEGylation”?
Response 1: We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments. On the question of
“At the same time, the addition of LbL NPs inhibited proliferation more efficiency
than the addition of PLGA NPs”, the reason was mentioned in the manuscript “which
is due to the self-assembled nano-encapsulated polyelectrolyte materials, which may
have an impact on cell growth”.
2: As to your suggestion that explain the reason of ‘The cytotoxicity of PLO was
weakened by PEGylation”, we have already added the reason in the revised
manuscript.
“The cytotoxicity of PLO was weakened by PEGylation due to the conjugated
PEG chains shielding the positively charged amine groups of it [23].”
3. In Fig. 6. Please revise the label position and size of the figure.
Response: Thank you for the suggestion. We have now revised the label position and
size of Figure 6 in the revision. Thanks.
4. In section 3.6, “Hemolysis test results illustrate that the polyelectrolyte material is
wrapped to help improve the biocompatibility of PLGA” have conflict with the
statement “the addition of LbL NPs inhibited proliferation more efficiency than
the addition of PLGA NPs”, please confirm the statement.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comment and apologize for the
inconvenience caused during the peer-review process. As for your doubts, we have
already explained in the section 3.4.2, “the difference between the two types of NPs is
small and the rate of proliferation was greater than 75% and the toxicity evaluation
was level 1 in both conditions, indicating that the materials can be considered
biologically safe”. But in the hemolysis test results of section 3.6, it was shown that
“With an increase in material concentration, the rate of hemolysis also increased, with
the PLGA NP group significantly higher than the LbL NP group”, which means that
when the materials concentration is increased, polyelectrolyte improves the
biocompatibility of PLGA obviously. Compared to the results of the effects of the two
materials on the MCF-10A cells, the results of the hemolysis test showed that the
biocompatibility of the two materials was more significant and more comparable.
Thanks.
5. Relating to conclusion, recommend appropriate increase of reference.
Response: Thanks. We have added relevant reference No. 25 in the revision according
to your kindly suggestion.
6. Please check Fig 8. Four ligands were shown, however, only three color columns
were shown.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comment. We have explained the
“Acute systemic toxicity in mice” experimental results in the section 3.7, “Mice
injected with 6.4% phenol had significant toxic manifestations, including shortness of
breath, difficulty breathing, whole body convulsions, tremulous bursts, exophthalmos
and then slightly turning turning purple, which turned into a jerky reflex with rough
hair until death”. Therefore, in fig.8, there’s no data shown for mice injected with 6.4%
phenol group.
7. I suggest the authors consider the organization of Fig 3. Maybe you can set the
three curves in one Figure.
Response: Thank you very much for the good advice. As you say, it will be clearer if
we set the three curves in one Figure. But unfortunately, we can’t obtain the original
data to combine these curves. I am truly sorry about it. I contacted the co-first author
(Jingqian Fan), who has graduated for three years to supply the original data. She
checked her new computer. But unfortunately, she can't find the original data. Thus, I
asked the first author (Duanhua Cai) to check the current computer in the lab to find
the original data. But when she answered back, she told me that the computer had
been repaired once and all data were missed. I am truly shocked by the news. What I
can guarantee now is that all the figures are from the dissertation with no modification.
So, we can’t combine these three curves into one without the original data. Thanks for
your understanding.
Reviewer #3:
1. The preparation of LbL self-assembled nanoparticles should be briefly described.
Response: We thank the reviewer for the constructive suggestion. We have now
added the method for preparing the carrier under the “Materials” in the experimental
section, and the respective text was highlighted in the manuscript.
“LbL self-assembled nanoparticles were prepared as previously described [14].
Briefly, the PLGA NPs were prepared by O/W emulsion-solvent evaporation method,
and then PLO and fucoidan were deposited layer by layer alternatively on the surface
of the substrate core by electrostatic interaction.”
2.Layer by layer self-assembly technology has broaden the application prospects in
anti-tumor research, if your research team studies in depth on this basis, better results
will be achieved.
Response: Thank you very much for the valuable suggestion. Our team is working
hard to do further research in this area and expect to have better results to share in the
future.
We hope that our responses are satisfactory, and the revised manuscript is now
acceptable for further process of publication in Royal Society Open Science and
would like to thank you for your kind consideration of our revised version of the
manuscript for resubmission. If any further information is required at this point, then
please do let me know.
