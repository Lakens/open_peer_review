Nielsen, Early Animal Evolution: A morphologist's view.
Nielsen reviews the morphological characters of each of the four non-bilaterian groups as well as
choanoflagellates, with a view to evaluate evolutionary relationships.
The manuscript is a concise summary of the principal features of each group and as such could be
not only extremely useful to a newcomer to the field, but also an excellent opinion piece, with a
few organizational changes and some additions.
The abstract proposes an interesting hypothesis and although the text presents data, there is very
limited analysis of the data, and a simple conclusion at the end saying the data supports the
hypothesis is not easily digested. Below are some suggestions for changes that would improve
this manuscript.
1. The manuscript sits between review and opinion piece. It would be more useful if it were more
objective and if the text really evaluated character gain or loss in the two scenarios proposed,
equally: by studying character gain and loss in the case Porifera branched first or in the case
Ctenophora branched first. If that were added it would greatly improve the manuscript and
increase interest.
2. The headers of subsections outline the author's argument, but given this is about morphology,
it seems that the argument would be better placed in a section of its own at the beginning (using
those headers) and then new headers might better be titles that highlight key characters that help
determine, in a morphologist's view, the likelihood of moving from one state to another
(following that argument). Header titles might be for example: 'Unicell to metazoan: cell
differentiation' and 'Gaining an epithelium' or 'Epithelia and digestion: the gut'...something along
those lines.
For example, choanoflagellates are described as single uniform unicells and the need for
phagocytosis by each cell and lack of transfer of material between cells is a character that
distinguishes them from metazoans. Some work suggest even similar cells can appear to have
distinct characters in colonial flagellates (e.g. Laundon et al 2019), from a morphological view, but
this is not yet supported by transcription of molecules. Whether colonies pass materials between
one-another has not properly been addressed, and seems the point where Nielsen draws the line.
However the text does not remind readers that these organisms are endpoints in evolutionary
experiments and so some intermediate form that might have shared nutrients could have existed.
Instead the argument is made that collared cells are innately similar, and by parsimony sponges
arose from a collared ancestor. This is not necessarily the case however, since not all poriferans
have collared cells - collared cells can be lost and gained even within the Porifera.
More emphasis should fall on examining the morphological transition from Porifera through
other non-bilaterians and in turn, from Ctenophora through other non-bilaterians including
Porifera. An examination of what losses must be considered were Porifera sister to Cnidaria and
Placozoa would be helpful. A figure showing the gains on one scenario and losses on the other
would be useful.
3. Key features of the different transitions are discussed (e.g. collagens) but not comprehensively.
a) For example, Type IV collagen may not in fact be necessary for making epithelia. Even colonial
3
filisterians can make good epithelia (see Dudin et al on Sphaeroforma antarctica in BioArchive),
as can slime molds. What glues the cells together in metazoans (collagen) is not one of the
characters Nielsen addresses, but seems like it might be a very useful character to evaluate in
depth. It should at least be touched on.
b) Phagocytosis and digestion and transfer of food are discussed in one section but needs more
attention. Contrary to what is said under the Choanoblastea section, digestion is quite well
known in sponges (e.g. Willenz and Van de Vyver, Imsieke, Wilkinson). Can the present
ctenophore groups tell us anything about that transition though? What about groups that may
not have fossilized, just as Nielsen says that sponges without skeletons would not have fossilized.
Absence of fossils means many groups with these characters could have existed. How a gut
evolved is addressed under the gastrea section too. It would be useful if one section addressed
feeding, digestion and the gut, with all groups.
c) Whether or not nerves arose and were lost is also addressed, but it seems cursory. This topic
has been covered heavily by others but the relevance of the gain of nerves as a morphological
character could be better discussed - a morphological view on this is lacking in the literature.
4. There are small but significant misunderstandings in these sections. For example, Pg 3 lines 8-9
refer to muscle - but a definition of muscle is needed. Presumably sponges have a type of smooth
muscle (most authors from the earliest to recent) find this. It is not clear what contracts. On the
next line it says 'myocyte (astrocyte)' but probably means 'actinocyte' not the supporting cell of
neurons in the brain. In the same section ciliary is used instead of flagella - noone considers
sponge choanocytes to have cilia; it is not a question of semantics because it can be quite
confusing to readers.
Neuropeptides is a term used to refer to a range of chemical signalling molecules. Neuropeptide
means a very small molecule and should not be confused with other signalling molecules, so it
would be better to say small molecules or chemical signalling molecules.
Genes/molecules are said to be included (in the abstract) but the single line after sections stating
that there is or isn't an expansion of genes is not helpful. On the contrary, the section addressing
nerves almost only deals with molecules, not morphology. More care as to what data is included
and not would improve the ability to arrive at the conclusion the author reaches.
5. Terminology of 'above', 'lower', 'below' are not useful in discussing phylogenetic relationships
and these should be rephrased as sister to the remaining metazoa, or branched before or after a
particular group. Similarly what is 'traditional' (line 25 page 1, also line 35-36), and what is 'usual'
(pg 4 line 45-46)?
6. A time frame for the change in thinking is not described and might be useful for new readers.
For example, how long has the Porifera first paradigm been in place, and what was it based on
(examples of authors who concluded this and why)? Possibly a section just revisiting the
arguments (as suggested earlier) including this paradigm would be a useful preface to the
evaluation of the morphological data.
7. Combining ideas into sections: i) fossils, ii) theories: In addition to moving references to fossil
data to one section on 'the fossil record (and its absence)' it would be useful to have a section on
'theories'. Under fossils would go the absence of a record for sponges lacking a skeleton (and
what that might mean) and the new records for ctenophores (discussed under ctenophores) as
well as the speculation of placozoan fossils. The concepts of steroid biomarkers would also fit
here. Note that evidence for those as markers of demosponges is eroding with the finding of a
strong sterol marker from Rhizaria (see Nature Ecology & Evolution 3(4) · March 2019). Under
4
the section on theories there could be an elaboration of the referred to theory in reference 19
(Nielsen's work) as well as theories currently in the section on Placozoa (regarding the plakula);
elaboration of 'other theories' (pg 4 line 62) would also fit here. These sections would be much
easier for newcomers to the field to quickly get the background for the problem.
Figure 1 shows characters but some are unclear (e.g. what are 'eumetazoan genes'), and
neuropeptides A and B, which according to the descriptions in the text are small signalling
molecules not neuropeptides. It is not immediately clear what this figure shows since the
morphological characters are not well linked to transitions.
The discussion could use a greater argument building on synthesis of the data discussed in the
previous sections. Synthesis and argument is lacking and so the conclusion lands abruptly
without it being clear how it was arrived at. This may be a space consideration, but this is a
thoughtful manuscript and very worth having if organized appropriately and with enough
evaluation of the arguments to arrive at the conclusion stated.

I enjoyed reading the manuscript “Early Animal Evolution: A morphologist's view” by Professor
Claus Nielsen. The manuscript is a synthesis of our current knowledge of the early evolution of
animals, with emphasis on evolutionary pathways possibly followed by morphological systems.
The text is authoritative and sometimes speculative, but this is expected from this type of
manuscript. The quality of the writing and content is up to the standards of previous work by
Professor Nielsen. I would like to congratulate him for his contribution to the debate.
I have some suggestions, just for the sake of clarity and to make the text more accessible to
readers who are not expert on this field.
-Page 1, line 26: “above”, I understand the use of such terms is convenient, but they are not
5
precise. I would suggest rewording the sentence along the lines of sponges diverging first in the
tree, ctenophores splitting later close to cnidarians.
-Page 1, line 41: “basal” is a term that it is losing support in the literature due to ambiguity. I
would suggest replacing by “early diverging/splitting”.
-Page 1, line 49: please, provide reference for filastereans as sister to animals.
-Page 1, line 53: “Unicellularity precludes differentiation into different cell types”, I think this
needs elaboration. All the lineages of non-animal holozoans display facultative multicellular
stages with cell differentiation (Nicole King and Ruiz-Trillo work). And even during unicellular
stages, they show sequential cell types segregated by time, not in space (idem). The gene systems
used in those cell stages are most likely the same used to deploy different cell types in space and
time in animals. Please, see recent reviews by Sebe-Pedros (Nature Rev Genetics 2017), Brunet
and King (Developm Cell 2018) and Paps (Integrative Comparative Biology 2018).
-Page 2, line 44: this sentence seems a bit out of place and could add more to the manuscript’s
argument. I would suggest fleshing it out, maybe mention that those new genes are related to
animal multicellularity hallmarks (gene regulation, adhesion, cell cycle, etc). Those are ell
explained in the reviews cited in the previous point.
-Page 3, line 20: a recent paper has disputed the validity of Ediacaran sponge-markers, as these
seem to be also found in Rhizaria (Nettersheim et al, Nature Ecology and Evolution 2019). This
could be mentioned.
-Page 3, line 56: “A large number of genes found in the Eumetazoans are absent from the
poriferans”, this can also be said of ctenophores (Pisani et al PNAS 2015, Paps and Holland
Nature Comms 2018, or Pett et al Molecular Biology and Evolution 2019).
-Page 4, line 19: I think that for the sake of non-experts, brief descriptions of cnidae and colloblast
are needed.
-Page 4, line 46: similarly, a succinct explanation of what the ‘usual’ ultrastructure of synapses is
(or at least put an example of animal).
-Page 5, lines 24-27: I think it is worth to mention that recent works with a significantly expanded
placozoan sampling and using site-heterogeneous evolutionary models place placozoans as sister
to cnidarians, please see Laumer et al eLife 2018, and Eitel et al PloS Biology 2018 (Supp Figs S15-
S18).
-Page 6, line 11: the reference 93 on “animal” cholesterol found in Dickinsonia, the discussion of
the very same paper acknowledges that all these molecules are also found in non-animal
holozoans, calling into question their claim of the animal affiliation of Dickinsonia. They just
decided to ignore it in the title of the paper.
-Page 6, line 40: the term “important molecules” requires clarification.
-Page 6, line 40: similarly to “basal”, the expression “ancestral position of sponges” would need
rewording.
-Figure 1: at the root of the tree, the idea of an obligate unicellular ancestor is problematic. As
mentioned above, ichthyosporeans, filasterans, and choanoflagellates contain species with
multicellular stages (some aggregative, some colonial).
-Figure 1: the figure does not include bilaterians, whose position is key to reconstruct some of the
nodes. Or better said, the position of placozoans respect Cnidaria and Bilateria is essential.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr David Ferrier):
Two expert referees have provided a number of helpful suggestions (and a third referee is due to
provide their comments soon, which will be passed on if they arrive, but since these further
comments are now overdue it seems unwise to delay sending the received comments any longer).
Both referees find this manuscript to be of great interest and they provide comments that would
strengthen the paper still further. All of their comments are aimed at making the manuscript as
accessible as possible to the widest readership. It would clearly be desirable to incorporate as
many of their suggestions as possible, even though some of these require a significant reworking
of elements of the organisation of the current manuscript structure (hence the ‘major revisions’
decision).
One further comment on a matter close to my own heart is the citation of the recent Pastrana
sponge ParaHox paper (reference [80]) on page 5. I would urge caution in the mention of this
particular paper and would argue that describing it as casting “serious doubt” on the sponge Cdx
8
ParaHox gene classification as unwarranted. There are serious flaws in this Pastrana paper, in
terms of weaknesses in their own analyses (lack of support values, lack of rooted phylogenies,
use of unsuitable sequence evolution models, acceptance of a biologically unreasonable Ankx
classification) as well as their deliberate decision to ignore significant elements of the evidence
(synteny) used in the previous literature that helped to classify the sponge gene as a Cdx. Whilst I
agree that the paper can be cited as highlighting that the sponge Cdx story is still under debate, I
think that it is not correct to say that the Pastrana paper casts serious doubt on the sponge Cdx
classification. Further paper(s) on this topic should follow in the future!

Nielsen, Early Animal Evolution: A morphologist's view.

choanoflagellates, with a view to evaluate evolutionary relationships.

decided to ignore it in the title of the paper.
-Page 6, line 40: the term “important molecules” requires clarification.
-Page 6, line 40: similarly to “basal”, the expression “ancestral position of sponges” would need
rewording.
-Figure 1: at the root of the tree, the idea of an obligate unicellular ancestor is problematic. As
mentioned above, ichthyosporeans, filasterans, and choanoflagellates contain species with
multicellular stages (some aggregative, some colonial).
-Figure 1: the figure does not include bilaterians, whose position is key to reconstruct some of the
nodes. Or better said, the position of placozoans respect Cnidaria and Bilateria is essential.

Review of Nielsen – Open Science
This revision reads very well. I found a few small errors and have a number of small comments
which I list below, with tables and figures first.
Table 1:
Spelling of Nidogen (Nodogen)
Cells with a collar complex – the text refers to these in all metazoans, and yet here in the table
they are only listed in Porifera and unicells. The text refers to choanocytes and collar cells as two
different things – perhaps best to either remove this or rename these here to be consistent with
the text.
‘metazoan genes’ and ‘eumetazoan genes’ – needs reference to the text or some indication of what
these are.
Figure 3 caption: typo ‘based on losses”
I think the new figures are excellent additions.
Manuscript text:
Abstract:
L 24 typo: Important
L 29 ‘Ctenophore-first’ theory (keep the same terminology throughout)
Introduction:
P2/23 Line 58 – cannot say ‘basal animal group’ here. Change this to sister group to all other
metazoan, as is correctly written on line 39 and later in the subheading below on line 56.
P3/23 Line 13 – what is a ‘basal’ vane? Is that the supposed location of the vane on the flagellum?
I think it runs top to bottom.
L 15 – what is ‘continuity’ between the cells?
P3/23 L48 – ‘show their evolution from’ – assumes homology, but it’s an assumption of the
author. There is no evidence these structures are either homologous or convergent and so it
should be left open question.
13
L58 – ‘lower’ is also not generally accepted now unless referring specifically to the physical
position on a picture of a tree. Use ‘non-bilaterian’ instead, which would work well here.
P4/23 Line 5 – note that there is also no basement membrane in many (most?) acoels, which I find
pretty interesting! I haven’t looked for perlecan or nidogen there though.
L15 – reword to change ‘is’ to ‘are’ for ease of reading: suggest ‘There are different theories…’
L22 – completely agree.
L38-39 – loss: is this sentence needed? Or if kept then elaborate to say that the electrical signal
travels through the entire animal’s syncytial tissues (not just a choanosyncytium…which is part
of the whole syncytium).
L41-42 – There’s a sentence that seems incomplete and possibly left in. Or a period is missing.
In the responses document the author says all fossil references are removed, but this and later
reference to Dickinsonia are left in.
P5/23 Line 12-13 – remove ‘for’
L14 – Diversity of ‘what’? Of morphologies? This probably doesn’t refer to species diversity?
L40 – ‘The cnidarians’ – maybe clarify this is the larva.
L43 – ‘Ctenophore’ – cydippid or adult? These two sentences are comparing structures on larvae
with those on adults – some clarification is needed about what is directly comparable especially
since the ctenophore larva is really a miniature adult (the larva that we know today), while the
cnidarian larva comes in a range of morphologies, and none are like the adult.
P6/23 – Note that the epitheliomuscular cells are also striated.
L34 – There is actually no 5HT in cnidarians (melanopsin receptors are the closest) – see Anctil
2009 (Anctil M. 2009. Chemical transmission in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis: A
genomic perspective. Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part D: Genomics and
Proteomics 4(4):268-289.) And also Bosch et al 2017. Bosch TCG, Klimovich A, Domazet-Lošo T,

systems in ctenophores. The Journal of Experimental Biology 218(4):598-611. And supplemental
data in Moroz et al 2014.).
P8/23 – last line – what is meant by ‘unsupported groups’?
References:
3 – Parentheses are around a blank (no Doi?)
10 – this reference should be 2019, MBE (it is now published)
23 – Lauden et al needs the Doi or some location information.
42 – ‘eds’ is written twice
53 – ‘eds’ is also written twice

sen, Early Animal Evolution: A morphologist's view.
sen reviews the morphological characters of each of the four non-bilaterian groups as well as
anoflagellates, with a view to evaluate evolutionary relationships.
manuscript is a concise summary of the principal features of each group and as such could be not only
emely useful to a newcomer to the field, but also an excellent opinion piece, with a few organizational
nges and some additions.
comments are indicated by • xxx •
stract and Discussion have been rewritten •
abstract proposes an interesting hypothesis and although the text presents data, there is very limited
lysis of the data, and a simple conclusion at the end saying the data supports the hypothesis is not easily
sted. Below are some suggestions for changes that would improve this manuscript. • Analyses of all the
asets would make the manuscript enormous, and analyses of the more molecular-based data are
ond my capacity. I have added two new illustrations to the Discussion and highlighted the
sequences inherent in the Ctenophora-first hypothesis. This is added to the Abstract and the Discussion
been expanded •
he manuscript sits between review and opinion piece. It would be more useful if it were more objective
if the text really evaluated character gain or loss in the two scenarios proposed, equally: by studying
racter gain and loss in the case Porifera branched first or in the case Ctenophora branched first. If that
e added it would greatly improve the manuscript and increase interest • see above •
he headers of subsections outline the author's argument, but given this is about morphology, it seems
t the argument would be better placed in a section of its own at the beginning (using those headers) and
n new headers might better be titles that highlight key characters that help determine, in a
rphologist's view, the likelihood of moving from one state to another (following that argument). Header
s might be for example: 'Unicell to metazoan: cell differentiation' and 'Gaining an epithelium' or
thelia and digestion: the gut'...something along those lines.
ave thought a lot about your suggestion, and it might work for the first steps of the evolution (the
in of multicellularity), but as far as I can see, it will become quite confusing at the next levels, so I have
ed with my original organization of the text •
example, choanoflagellates are described as single uniform unicells and the need for phagocytosis by
h cell and lack of transfer of material between cells is a character that distinguishes them from
azoans. Some work suggest even similar cells can appear to have distinct characters in colonial
ellates (e.g. Laundon et al 2019), from a morphological view, but this is not yet supported by
scription of molecules. • I have changed the text to specify that non-feeding cells do not occur in the
ellular organisms.• Whether colonies pass materials between one-another has not properly been
ressed, and seems the point where Nielsen draws the line. However the text does not remind readers
t these organisms are endpoints in evolutionary experiments and so some intermediate form that might
e shared nutrients could have existed. • It can of course be imagined, but is there any hint of such a
e? • Instead the argument is made that collared cells are innately similar, and by parsimony sponges
se from a collared ancestor. This is not necessarily the case however, since not all poriferans have
ared cells - collared cells can be lost and gained even within the Porifera. • Information about the
uliar carnivorous sponges has been added. I know of no example of ‘gain of collared cells’ in Porifera •
re emphasis should fall on examining the morphological transition from Porifera through other non-
terians and in turn, from Ctenophora through other non-bilaterians including Porifera. An examination
hat losses must be considered were Porifera sister to Cnidaria and Placozoa would be helpful. A figure
wing the gains on one scenario and losses on the other would be useful. • Two new diagrams have
n added to the discussion •
ey features of the different transitions are discussed (e.g. collagens) but not comprehensively.
or example, Type IV collagen may not in fact be necessary for making epithelia. Even colonial filisterians
make good epithelia (see Dudin et al on Sphaeroforma antarctica in BioArchive), as can slime molds.
at glues the cells together in metazoans (collagen) is not one of the characters Nielsen addresses, but
ms like it might be a very useful character to evaluate in depth. It should at least be touched on. • text
nged •
hagocytosis and digestion and transfer of food are discussed in one section but needs more attention.
trary to what is said under the Choanoblastea section, digestion is quite well known in sponges (e.g.
enz and Van de Vyver, Imsieke, Wilkinson). • information added • Can the present ctenophore groups
us anything about that transition though? What about groups that may not have fossilized, just as
sen says that sponges without skeletons would not have fossilized. Absence of fossils means many
ups with these characters could have existed. How a gut evolved is addressed under the gastrea section
. It would be useful if one section addressed feeding, digestion and the gut, with all groups. • It would
eed be interesting to compare digestion in the main clades, but as far as I know, nothing is known about
ctenophores. The gain/loss of a gut in the two scenarios are discussed together with the two new
rams •
hether or not nerves arose and were lost is also addressed, but it seems cursory. This topic has been
ered heavily by others but the relevance of the gain of nerves as a morphological character could be
ter discussed - a morphological view on this is lacking in the literature. • new sentence added •
here are small but significant misunderstandings in these sections. For example, Pg 3 lines 8-9 refer to
scle - but a definition of muscle is needed. Presumably sponges have a type of smooth muscle (most
hors from the earliest to recent) find this. It is not clear what contracts. On the next line it says 'myocyte
rocyte)' but probably means 'actinocyte' not the supporting cell of neurons in the brain • corrected •. In
same section ciliary is used instead of flagella - noone considers sponge choanocytes to have cilia; it is
a question of semantics because it can be quite confusing to readers. • I usually talk about two types of
: undulatory cilia (usually called flagella – different from the bacterial flagella) and effective-stroke cilia.
efer to keep to my usual nomenclature •
ropeptides is a term used to refer to a range of chemical signalling molecules. Neuropeptide means a
y small molecule and should not be confused with other signalling molecules, so it would be better to
small molecules or chemical signalling molecules. • changed to neurotransmitters •
es/molecules are said to be included (in the abstract • deleted •) but the single line after sections
ing that there is or isn't an expansion of genes is not helpful. On the contrary, the section addressing
ves almost only deals with molecules, not morphology. More care as to what data is included and not
uld improve the ability to arrive at the conclusion the author reaches. • sentence added •
erminology of 'above', 'lower', 'below' are not useful in discussing phylogenetic relationships and these
uld be rephrased as sister to the remaining metazoa, or branched before or after a particular group.
ilarly what is 'traditional' (line 25 page 1, also line 35-36), and what is 'usual' (pg 4 line 45-46)? •
nged •
time frame for the change in thinking is not described and might be useful for new readers. For
mple, how long has the Porifera first paradigm been in place, and what was it based on (examples of
hors who concluded this and why)? Possibly a section just revisiting the arguments (as suggested earlier)
uding this paradigm would be a useful preface to the evaluation of the morphological data. • Sentence
ed at the beginning of the text •
ombining ideas into sections: i) fossils, ii) theories: In addition to moving references to fossil data to one
ion on 'the fossil record (and its absence)' it would be useful to have a section on 'theories'. Under
ils would go the absence of a record for sponges lacking a skeleton (and what that might mean) and the
records for ctenophores (discussed under ctenophores) as well as the speculation of placozoan fossils.
formation on fossils has generally been removed • The concepts of steroid biomarkers would also fit
e. Note that evidence for those as markers of demosponges is eroding with the finding of a strong sterol
ker from Rhizaria (see Nature Ecology & Evolution 3(4) · March 2019). Under the section on theories
re could be an elaboration of the referred to theory in reference 19 (Nielsen's work) as well as theories
ently in the section on Placozoa (regarding the plakula); elaboration of 'other theories' (pg 4 line 62)
uld also fit here. These sections would be much easier for newcomers to the field to quickly get the
kground for the problem.
re 1 shows characters but some are unclear (e.g. what are 'eumetazoan genes'), and neuropeptides A
B, which according to the descriptions in the text are small signalling molecules not neuropeptides •
nged to neurotransmitters •. It is not immediately clear what this figure shows since the morphological
racters are not well linked to transitions.
discussion could use a greater argument building on synthesis of the data discussed in the previous
ions. Synthesis and argument is lacking and so the conclusion lands abruptly without it being clear how
as arrived at. This may be a space consideration, but this is a thoughtful manuscript and very worth
ing if organized appropriately and with enough evaluation of the arguments to arrive at the conclusion
ed. • New illustrations added and discussion expanded •

ments to the Author(s)
joyed reading the manuscript “Early Animal Evolution: A morphologist's view” by Professor Claus
sen. The manuscript is a synthesis of our current knowledge of the early evolution of animals, with
phasis on evolutionary pathways possibly followed by morphological systems. The text is authoritative
sometimes speculative, but this is expected from this type of manuscript. The quality of the writing and
tent is up to the standards of previous work by Professor Nielsen. I would like to congratulate him for
contribution to the debate.
ve some suggestions, just for the sake of clarity and to make the text more accessible to readers who
not expert on this field.
stract and discussion have been rewritten•
ge 1, line 26: “above”, I understand the use of such terms is convenient, but they are not precise. I
uld suggest rewording the sentence along the lines of sponges diverging first in the tree, ctenophores
tting later close to cnidarians. • changed •
ge 1, line 41: “basal” is a term that it is losing support in the literature due to ambiguity. I would suggest
acing by “early diverging/splitting”. • changed •
ge 1, line 49: please, provide reference for filastereans as sister to animals. • information about
hyosporeans and filastreans added •
ge 1, line 53: “Unicellularity precludes differentiation into different cell types”, I think this needs
oration. All the lineages of non-animal holozoans display facultative multicellular stages with cell
erentiation (Nicole King and Ruiz-Trillo work). And even during unicellular stages, they show sequential
types segregated by time, not in space (idem). The gene systems used in those cell stages are most
ly the same used to deploy different cell types in space and time in animals. Please, see recent reviews
ebe-Pedros (Nature Rev Genetics 2017), Brunet and King (Developm Cell 2018) and Paps (Integrative
parative Biology 2018). • As far as I can see, there are no reports of multicellularity in these organisms.
y are all colonial or multinucleate •

revision reads very well. I found a few small errors and have a number of small comments, which I list
ow, with tables and figures first.
le 1:
lling of Nidogen (Nodogen) •OK•
s with a collar complex – the text refers to these in all metazoans, and yet here in the table they are
y listed in Porifera and unicells. The text refers to choanocytes and collar cells as two different things –
haps best to either remove this or rename these here to be consistent with the text. •The terminology is
cult. Choanoflagellates and choanocytes have collar complexes which are used in particle collection.
ar cells of various types have a ring of usually short microvilli and a usually short cilium, but they don’t
ect particles. I think that it will only add to the confusion if I try to change the terminology. I have added
lar complexes consist of a ring of microvilli surrounding an undulating cilium and function in water
sport and particle collection’ to the legend •
tazoan genes’ and ‘eumetazoan genes’ – needs reference to the text or some indication of what these
• The reference to Srivastava et al. gives the details •
re 3 caption: typo ‘based on losses” •OK •
nk the new figures are excellent additions.
nuscript text:
tract:
typo: Important •OK •
‘Ctenophore-first’ theory (keep the same terminology throughout) • corrected •
oduction:
23 Line 58 – cannot say ‘basal animal group’ here. Change this to sister group to all other metazoan, as
orrectly written on line 39 and later in the subheading below on line 56. • changed •
23 Line 13 – what is a ‘basal’ vane? Is that the supposed location of the vane on the flagellum? I think it
s top to bottom. • basal deleted •
– what is ‘continuity’ between the cells? • changed to no exchange of nutrients between the cells •
23 L48 – ‘show their evolution from’ – assumes homology, but it’s an assumption of the author. There is
evidence these structures are either homologous or convergent and so it should be left open question. •
assumption is that of Arendt et al ref 24. •
– ‘lower’ is also not generally accepted now unless referring specifically to the physical position on a
ure of a tree. Use ‘non-bilaterian’ instead, which would work well here. • changed •
23 Line 5 – note that there is also no basement membrane in many (most?) acoels, which I find pretty
eresting! I haven’t looked for perlecan or nidogen there though.
– reword to change ‘is’ to ‘are’ for ease of reading: suggest ‘There are different theories…’ • changed •
– completely agree.
-39 – loss: is this sentence needed? Or if kept then elaborate to say that the electrical signal travels
ugh the entire animal’s syncytial tissues (not just a choanosyncytium…which is part of the whole
cytium). • changed to syncytial tissues •
-42 – There’s a sentence that seems incomplete and possibly left in. Or a period is missing.
he responses document the author says all fossil references are removed, but this and later reference to
insonia are left in. • period added. A few references to fossils have been kept •
23 Line 12-13 – remove ‘for’ • OK •
– Diversity of ‘what’? Of morphologies? This probably doesn’t refer to species diversity? •
rphological added •
– ‘The cnidarians’ – maybe clarify this is the larva. • done •
– ‘Ctenophore’ – cydippid or adult? These two sentences are comparing structures on larvae with those
adults – some clarification is needed about what is directly comparable especially since the ctenophore
a is really a miniature adult (the larva that we know today), while the cnidarian larva comes in a range
orphologies, and none are like the adult. • explained •
23 – Note that the epitheliomuscular cells are also striated. • no action •
– There is actually no 5HT in cnidarians (melanopsin receptors are the closest) – see Anctil 2009 (Anctil

23 – last line – what is meant by ‘unsupported groups’? • changed to groups with no synapomorphies •
