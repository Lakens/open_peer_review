The authors analyze the over-expression of the gene coding for the old yellow enzyme (OYE) in
the resistance of Trypanosoma cruzi to benznidazol (Bz) and agents that damage the parasite
genome (H2O2, MMS and <U+03B3>-radiation). Over-expression of the OYE gene in transfected parasites
was confirmed at transcriptional and translational levels and it does not affect cell proliferation.
Transfected parasites over-expressing OYE were more sensitive to Bz and to H2O2 and to genetic
damage caused by MMS and <U+03B3>-radiation as well. Those parasites also presented a lower capacity
of infectivity as compared to control, GFP-transfected parasites. Bz treatment of transfected
parasites over-expressing OYE showed a decrease in trypanothione reductase, an increase in
superoxi-dismutase, and an alteration of the mitochondrial membrane potential and of the cell
cycle.
These results sustain the conclusion of the authors, regarding the participation of OYE in the
activation pathway of Bz leading to an increase of its activity on susceptible parasites.
Consequently, this manuscript should be accepted for publication in the Royal Society Open
Science, with minor revision, as follows:
In the legend of Figure 1 (page 20), figure 1C (western blot) is missing. Then, figure C should be
D (growth curve).
In infection experiments transfected trypomastigotes were used (Fig 2C). However, it is not clear
whether in survival experiments, using Bz and H2O2 (Figures 2A and 2B) transfected
epimastigotes or trypomastigotes were used. The authors should clarify in the text and in the
3
legend whether they are using transfected epimastigotes or transfected trypomastigotes (in
Figures 2A and 2B).
In the legend of Fig 2C (page 29), it is stated that infection of Vero cells are the representation of
microscopy images. However, images of intra-cellular amastigotes are not shown and in the text
it is stated that the ordinate corresponds to the number of amastigotes, which corresponds to
Figure 2C. In the same legend the figures 120 µm and 100 µm should correspond to 120 µM and
100 µM, respectively.
In the legend of Figure 3, page 20, 3B represents the densitometric analysis of 3A not the
fluorescent intensity of dye into mitochondria, which corresponds to 3C.
In the legend of Figure 5. “The bars represent the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell
cycle (G1, S, G2/M) by non treated (NT) and treated (T) with Bz”. By non treated?
A revision of the English language, particularly in the legend of Figure 6, page 21, would
improve the comprehension of the manuscript.

My general impression is that most experiments have been properly conducted,
and the addressed problem is of great importance for the understanding of the
mode of action of benznidazole an important weapon for treating Chagas
disease.
However the Authors of the paper need to address several problems
Firstly I will advice the Authors to check the English of the Manuscript, it needs
to be more fluid and readable.
Second there are several problems with the figures and their interpretation
Figure 1 says C is a growth curve which in fact is D and what is shown is a
Western blot without a legend for. Lines 34-36.
Figure 2 C (line 34) indicates that there is a microscopy image, which is not
shown.
Figure 3 C is shown but not commented in the legend.
Figure 4 the interpretation of this figure is not very convincing, it looks like both
parasites have a similar growth curve, and whatever manifestation of the
irradiation shouldn’t it be showing earlier? I suppose DNA repairing processes
occur along or before the DNA replication process during the S phase of the cell
cycle

Ref: Response to referees manuscript RSOS-170773
Hereby we submit the response to referees of manuscript entitled “Prostaglandin F2a
Synthase in Trypanosoma cruzi play critical roles in oxidative stress and
susceptibility to Benznidazole” by Paola García-Huertas, Ana María Mejía-Jaramillo,
Carlos Renato Machado, Anna Cláudia Guimarães and Omar Triana Chávez for
possible publication in RSOS.
The authors wish to thank the reviewers and editor for their clear and concise
comments. It is important to state that the manuscript was modified according to the
comments done for them.
We sincerely hope have properly addressed all matters highlighted.
Please find below the answers to the reviewers’ evaluations.
Associate Editor's comments:
1. In the legend of Figure 1 (page 20), figure 1C (western blot) is missing. Then, figure
C should be D (growth curve).
R/: The changes were made in the legend of figure 1.
2. In infection experiments transfected trypomastigotes were used (Fig 2C). However, it
is not clear whether in survival experiments, using Bz and H2O2 (Figures 2A and 2B)
transfected epimastigotes or trypomastigotes were used. The authors should clarify in
the text and in the legend whether they are using transfected epimastigotes or
transfected trypomastigotes (in Figures 2A and 2B).
R/: Trypomastigotes were used only for the infection of cells. In the survival
curves and the other assays such as cell cycle and mitochondrial membrane
potential epimastigotes stages were used. We clarified this information in the
legend of figure 2.
3. In the legend of Fig 2C (page 29), it is stated that infection of Vero cells are the
representation of microscopy images. However, images of intra-cellular amastigotes are
not shown and in the text it is stated that the ordinate corresponds to the number of
amastigotes, which corresponds to Figure 2C. In the same legend the figures 120 µm
and 100 µm should correspond to 120 µM and 100 µM, respectively.
R/: We apologize for this error. The modifications were made in the text.
4. In the legend of Figure 3, page 20, 3B represents the densitometric analysis of 3A not
the fluorescent intensity of dye into mitochondria, which corresponds to 3C.
R/: The reviewer is right. We apologize for this error. We did the modifications in
the text.
5. Figure 4 the interpretation of this figure is not very convincing, it looks like both
parasites have a similar growth curve. The growth should be showing earlier?
R/: These results were obtained from three independent experiments and the
statistical analysis of two-way ANOVA and a post-test of bonferroni showed
statistically significant differences at the beginning and at the end of MMS
treatment, evidencing that GFP parasites recovered more efficiently than the
parasites transfected with OYE. Likewise, the results of gamma irradiation using
two-way ANOVA and a post-test of bonferroni showed statistically significant
differences between GFP parasites and transfected parasites with OYE, mainly at
day 10 after irradiation. This result showed that the GFP parasites recovered more
efficiently than the OYE parasites to the effect of gamma radiation reaching a
larger number of parasites.
6. In the legend of Figure 5. “The bars represent the percentage of cells in each phase of
the cell cycle (G1, S, G2/M) by non-treated (NT) and treated (T) with Bz”. It is not clear
what this refers to.
R/: The changes were made in the text to clarify this information.
The use of English is not at the appropriate standard for the journal and needs attention,
particularly in the legend of Figure 6, page 21, would improve the comprehension of the
manuscript.
R/: The changes were made in the text. American English Expert corrected this
paper. We added this certify. Also, the figure legends were corrected for a Native
American person.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
1. Firstly I will advice the Authors to check the English of the Manuscript, it needs to be
more fluid and readable.
R/: The text was subjected to a revision of English and changes were made to
improve understanding. The figure legends were correct for a Native American
Speaker. In addition, American English Expert corrected the English in this paper.
2. Second there are several problems with the figures and their interpretation: Figure 1
says C is a growth curve which in fact is D and what is shown is a Western blot without
a legend for. Lines 34-36. Figure 2 C (line 34) indicates that there is a microscopy
image, which is not shown. Figure 3 C is shown but not commented in the legend.
R/: The reviewer is right. We apologize for the different errors in the legends of
the figures. This was changed in the new version.
3. Figure 4 the interpretation of this figure is not very convincing, it looks like both
parasites have a similar growth curve, and whatever manifestation of the irradiation
shouldn’t it be showing earlier? I suppose DNA repairing processes occur along or
before the DNA replication process during the S phase of the cell cycle.
R/: In the new version, we rewrite this results trying to clarify these results. We
want to highlight that different works have been done mainly in the Research
Group of Dr. Carlos Renato Machado and have shown that T. cruzi strains takes
different times to recover to the effect of gamma radiation and MMS. They
recently showed that T. cruzi takes about 8 days to begin to grow after repairing
the damage caused to DNA by irradiation, which is similar to the result we
obtained (Garcia J, et al., 2016). In addition, it has been seen that the retention of
the cell cycle occurs in different phases of the cell cycle. Garcia et al., 2016
reported it in the S / G2 phase and we find retention in G1 phase.
This type of assay evaluates the ability of parasites to repair DNA damage, how
quickly they grow, and how many parasites they reach in the stationary phase. For
this reason, we conclude that the OYE parasites were more sensitive, since for both
MMS and gamma radiation they were slower to recovery and reached a lower
number of parasites compared to GFP parasites.

the cell cycle (G1, S, G2/M) by non treated (NT) and treated (T) with Bz”. By non
treated?
