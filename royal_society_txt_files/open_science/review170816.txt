This is a nicely-executed study showing that clonal ants possess phenotypic variation in a trait
(response thresholds to sucrose) that is of likely importance to colony function (for example, in
the allocation of foragers across food sources of different strength). The authors both confirm that
the colonies they studied were truly clonal, and they effectively showed a wide diversity of
thresholds in the workers of two colonies. This demonstration of phenotypic diversity that is not
genetically based offers an interesting new perspective on social insect colony function. There are,
however, a number of problems in how the results are interpreted, as well as some interesting
features of the data that deserve more attention.
1) The authors should be careful about the use of the word ‘individuality’. This word has many
meanings, so the authors need to be clear about which one they intend. They are using it to mean
phenotypic variation among individuals, but this is not immediately clear. Indeed, their citation
to Buss in the first sentence is confusing, since he uses the word very differently, to refer to the
evolution of higher levels of biological hierarchy from lower ones. He does not write, to my
knowledge, about functional variation among individuals in a group. I suggest that the authors
use a different word or explain earlier exactly what they mean.
2) The authors’ finding of phenotypic variation in a clonal ant species is certainly novel, but they
should better acknowledge that the notion of phenotypic plasticity (i.e., more than one phenotype
produced by the same genotype) is not a new one, and is clearly relevant to their findings. Some
attention to this concept in the discussion would be appropriate.
3) The authors’ hypothesis 3, which their data support, holds that thresholds change due to the
ants’ experience between the two measurement periods. This is a reasonable idea, but the authors
then leap to the conclusion that experience is acting through epigenetic changes. This is certainly
possible, but it is not the only available mechanism. Learning and other forms of neural plasticity
are well known mechanisms that could also account for these changes. The authors should re-
write their conclusions to consider these other possibilities.
4) At lines 312-314 in the discussion, the authors somewhat overstate the evidence for the
importance of inter-individual variation. The response threshold model for task allocation is
powerful and widely applied, but it is not the only idea about how division of labor can arise.
Similarly, variation is not clearly necessary for collective decision-making, as theoretical and
experimental work by Deneubourg and others has shown. It is reasonable to say on the basis of
the cited reference (6) that such variation can explain collective choice, but not that it is necessary
to do so.
5) It is reasonable to assume that variation in sucrose response thresholds is important to these
ants, but it should be noted that the authors have not shown an actual role for such variation in
this species (although they have in another species).
6) The paper should note that thresholds for sampled ants did not change much between
sampling periods (9 of 16 did not change at all). This stability seems important to any claims
about how variation arises. Could not the observed changes just be sampling noise? Perhaps the
thresholds are set fairly rigidly early in development, with only limited room for change. These
issues deserve some discussion.
7) Another point that deserves some discussion is the considerable difference in the distribution
3
of thresholds between the two colonies. This difference is noted at line 283 but not discussed any
further.
8) The paper reads well and is concise and well-organized, but there are a number of small
grammatical errors (mainly in proper use of singular and plural forms and in the use of articles).
9) I could not find Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, giving detailed results for the threshold test.
Minor points:
The three hypotheses for how threshold variation arises are described in detail three times. One
detailed presentation in the introduction would be enough, with brief reminders in the later
sections.
Lines 89-93: This sentence is awkward and hard to follow.
Line 117: A “chemical mechanism” seems a bit too specific. Don’t you just mean that some
developmental process causes a directional change in threshold with age?
Lines 149-151: This is hard to follow, and is better explained in the discussion.
Lines 189-196: I am no expert in molecular techniques, but this section was hard to follow.
Colony AC2 does not appear to have been used at all. Am I missing something?
Lines 257-259: The assumption that all of the workers in KC1 must be the queen’s, since she had
been the sole egg-layer for 4 years, depends on knowing that workers do not live that long. Is
there evidence for this?
Lines 278-281: This argument does not really belong in the results, but rather in the discussion
(where it is already found).
The legend to Figure 2 is a bit confusing. Is the Fisher’s test comparing the two colonies?

label_comment_2
This paper establishes a valuable ground for further exploration into responsible mechanisms for
the individual variation of response threshold in sucrose concentration in a clonal ant. The
authors employed dependable methods to confirm the clonal genetic background and presence of
individual variation in the threshold. Therefore, I find no major concerns about the scientific
value and strength of this paper.
I have the following minor comments.
1. Please add a brief explanation if individuality used in this paper differs from individual
variation.
2. If there were no mechanism for individual variation in a quantitative trait such as the present
response threshold, the threshold would be normally distributed among individuals at any snap
shot observation. This variation (individuality?) requires no additional factor such as experience
or epigenetics. This should be the null hypothesis that should be tested first, though significant
deviations from the normality seem obvious in both colonies. This will generate an explicit
question: What causes this deviation from the normal distribution? Or it should be cited or
explained if this question has been resolved in literature.
3. The second question in this paper should be whether the individual threshold fluctuates over
time beyond the scale of individual variation. This makes clear the null prediction that the
individual threshold randomly fluctuates over time. Although the present data from the two
snap shots may not be sufficient, I wonder if the authors mean to accept this null prediction,
which was not very clear from their writing.
4. I recommend the authors to rethink what the authors mean by “random directions” in lines
285-291, because of the following reason. If the individual threshold really randomly fluctuates
over time, then it would be logically impossible that the snap-shot distribution of the threshold
among clonal ants deviates from the normality. Instead, the temporal shifts of individual
threshold may be generated by some mechanism that maintains a certain range of individual
variation within a colony. Thus the present data could suggest the presence of this mechanism. I
wonder if the authors intended to argue for this mechanism by “experience” which is assumed
for the hypothesis 3 in the paper.
5. Very minor comment: English copy-editing would greatly improve this paper.

The English grammar and style needs revision in places. For example, the title would be better as
“Adaptive phenotypic variation among clonal ant workers”, and the running head should not
have the leading “A”. A few other examples: Line 35 should read “decision making” instead of
“decision-makings”; Line 70 should read “a basis of rationality” instead of “a basis of the
10
rationality”; Line 147 should read “to have official permission” instead of “to have an official
permission”. There are many other small issues like these.
The abstract does not specifically mention that sucrose thresholds were assessed. I suggest
changing the sentence at lines 40-41 to read as follows: “…are genetic clones, but they showed
variation in sucrose response thresholds.”
Since colony AC2 provided no data, the clearest thing would be to just leave it out of the paper
entirely.
It’s not clear which colony provided the re-measurement of thresholds. At line 225, the text says
that AC1 was re-measured, but line 286 says that AC1 could be used only for the first
measurement, implying that KC1 was used for re-measurement. This should be clarified.
Lines 329-332: I don’t think these new sentences are useful. I suggest cutting them and changing
the sentence at lines 327-329 as follows: “Variation in response threshold can underlie task
allocation [4], a colony’s long-term sustainability [5], and rational collective decision making [6].”
My earlier suggestion was simply to avoid saying that variation is “required” for any of these
things. This can be done by small changes in wording.
Lines 324-339: This new section is out of place. I suggest that you move it elsewhere (for example,
after line 364) and go directly from line 329 to line 341 (as in the original submission).
Lines 347-350: I suggest re-phrasing as follows: “The observed phenotypic variation in clonal S.
membranifera workers may be similarly adaptive for this species, but it is likely to be generated
by a mechanism that is independent of genomic identity (see below).”
Lines 350-352: These sentences are out of place. These are alternatives to epigenetic modification
as an explanation for the observed phenotypic variation. It would be better to mention this when
you bring up epigenetics (for example, at line 362 or somewhere in the paragraph at lines 392-
407).
Line 395: What is meant by “how many degrees”?

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a nicely-executed study showing that clonal ants possess phenotypic variation in a trait (response
thresholds to sucrose) that is of likely importance to colony function (for example, in the allocation of
foragers across food sources of different strength). The authors both confirm that the colonies they
studied were truly clonal, and they effectively showed a wide diversity of thresholds in the workers of
two colonies. This demonstration of phenotypic diversity that is not genetically based offers an interesting
new perspective on social insect colony function. There are, however, a number of problems in how the
results are interpreted, as well as some interesting features of the data that deserve more attention.
1-1
1) The authors should be careful about the use of the word ‘individuality’. This word has many
meanings, so the authors need to be clear about which one they intend. They are using it to mean
phenotypic variation among individuals, but this is not immediately clear. Indeed, their citation to Buss in
the first sentence is confusing, since he uses the word very differently, to refer to the evolution of higher
levels of biological hierarchy from lower ones. He does not write, to my knowledge, about functional
variation among individuals in a group. I suggest that the authors use a different word or explain earlier
exactly what they mean.
Thank you for your kind advices. Certainly, we use “individuality” as the variation of behavior observed.
To avoid confusion, we used the words ”a phenotypic variation” (title and other positions).
1-2
2) The authors’ finding of phenotypic variation in a clonal ant species is certainly novel, but
they should better acknowledge that the notion of phenotypic plasticity (i.e., more than one phenotype
produced by the same genotype) is not a new one, and is clearly relevant to their findings. Some attention
to this concept in the discussion would be appropriate.
Thank you very much for your adequate suggestions. We mentioned the phenomena of phenotypic
plasticity in Discussion and discussed about them with our findings (L333-338).
1-3
3) The authors’ hypothesis 3, which their data support, holds that thresholds change due to the
ants’ experience between the two measurement periods. This is a reasonable idea, but the authors then
leap to the conclusion that experience is acting through epigenetic changes. This is certainly possible, but
it is not the only available mechanism. Learning and other forms of neural plasticity are well known
mechanisms that could also account for these changes. The authors should re-write their conclusions to
consider these other possibilities.
We appreciate your adequate criticism. We also think these other mechanisms are the possible cause for
the observed phenomenon. We added a discussion on these mechanisms in the revised version
(L348-351). Anyway, we recognize that the present data cannot specify the cause of the observed change
in thresholds.
1-4
4) At lines 312-314 in the discussion, the authors somewhat overstate the evidence for the
importance of inter-individual variation. The response threshold model for task allocation is powerful and
widely applied, but it is not the only idea about how division of labor can arise. Similarly, variation is not
clearly necessary for collective decision-making, as theoretical and experimental work by Deneubourg
and others has shown. It is reasonable to say on the basis of the cited reference (6) that such variation can
explain collective choice, but not that it is necessary to do so.
Thank you for providing this nice criticism. Sure, our present statement may be too strong. In the revised
version, we followed the suggestion of Rev.1 (L324-331).
1-5
5) It is reasonable to assume that variation in sucrose response thresholds is important to these
ants, but it should be noted that the authors have not shown an actual role for such variation in this
species (although they have in another species).
Certainly, our data did not show the role of the observed variations. Thus, we followed the comment of
Rev.1 for this part (L348-351).
1-6
6) The paper should note that thresholds for sampled ants did not change much between
sampling periods (9 of 16 did not change at all). This stability seems important to any claims about how
variation arises. Could not the observed changes just be sampling noise? Perhaps the thresholds are set
fairly rigidly early in development, with only limited room for change. These issues deserve some
discussion.
We understand your opinion. We noted the above point in the Discussion (L271-276, L287-291).
1-7
7) Another point that deserves some discussion is the considerable difference in the distribution
of thresholds between the two colonies. This difference is noted at line 283 but not discussed any further.
This is an important point. However, this ant species is very rare in Japan, and we need more colonies to
confirm the divergence of the threshold distribution in a colony in nature. Unfortunately, this seems to be
nearly impossible by using the present species. Now, one of the authors (FI) found other clonal ants that
are easier to rear than Strumigenys membranifera. In the near future, we will perform further experiments
to examine the cause of such divergence of threshold distributions among colonies. Thus, in the present
study, we limitedly mentioned a large difference in the distribution between two colonies and pointed out
several presumable causes of this observed fact (L377-385).
1-8
8) The paper reads well and is concise and well-organized, but there are a number of small
grammatical errors (mainly in proper use of singular and plural forms and in the use of articles).
We are sorry for our poor English. We rechecked it. In addition, the revised MS has been checked for
English language by a native specialist of social insects (Dr. J. Billen; the previous chief editor of Insectes
Sociaux (the journal of the International Union of Studies for Social insect0). We hope this treatment will
satisfy Rev.1.
1-9
9) I could not find Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, giving detailed results for the threshold test.
We are very sorry for this mistake. In the revised version we confirm that the Supplementary Table 1 and
2 are included in the supplementary materials.
Minor points:
1-10
The three hypotheses for how threshold variation arises are described in detail three times. One detailed
presentation in the introduction would be enough, with brief reminders in the later sections.
We deleted the later two.
1-11
Lines 89-93: This sentence is awkward and hard to follow.
We rewrote this sentence to be more understandable (L90-94).
1-12
Line 117: A “chemical mechanism” seems a bit too specific. Don’t you just mean that some
developmental process causes a directional change in threshold with age?
Of course, it is possible. We mentioned the above notion in the MS (L119-120).
1-13
Lines 149-151: This is hard to follow, and is better explained in the discussion.
We tried to improve this problem, and moved this part to the Discussion (L308-313).
1-14
Lines 189-196: I am no expert in molecular techniques, but this section was hard to follow.
We tried to improve the understandability of this part (L185-200).
1-15
Colony AC2 does not appear to have been used at all. Am I missing something?
Because of a my caress miss the nest plaster of AC2 had been dried soon after the arriving to Hokkaido
Univ., and AC2 had been extinct. This is the reason of the absence of AC2 in the other experiments. We
mentioned this in the revised MS (L235-237).
1-19
Lines 257-259: The assumption that all of the workers in KC1 must be the queen’s, since she had been
the sole egg-layer for 4 years, depends on knowing that workers do not live that long. Is there evidence
for this?
Parthenogenetic reproduction of both queens and workers have been confirmed in a previous study (Ito et
al., 2010). This species became polygynous, and in fact, colony KC 1 contained a single queen at the
moment of collection but another queen has been reared during the laboratory rearing. The new queen is a
clone of the mother queen and with workers (see Ref. 10), and produced clonal workers by
parthenogenetic reproduction. Thus, although the KC1 at the experiment is a polygynous colony, all the
colony members should be genetic clones with exceptions at the nucleotide sites at which mutation had
occurred at genomic copying (as shown by the used genetic techniques, the band sharing rate is not
always 100% among individuals). We explained this in more detail (L305-310).
1-20
Lines 278-281: This argument does not really belong in the results, but rather in the discussion (where it
is already found).
We deleted this sentence, and confirmed that the same contents are in the Discussion (L277-280).
1-21
The legend to Figure 2 is a bit confusing. Is the Fisher’s test comparing the two colonies?
We are sorry for causing this confusion. We rewrote this part to clarify your question (L564-566).

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper establishes a valuable ground for further exploration into responsible mechanisms for the
individual variation of response threshold in sucrose concentration in a clonal ant. The authors employed
dependable methods to confirm the clonal genetic background and presence of individual variation in the
threshold. Therefore, I find no major concerns about the scientific value and strength of this paper.
I have the following minor comments.
2-1
1. Please add a brief explanation if individuality used in this paper differs from individual variation.
We used another representation. Please see the response to Rev.1’s comment 1-1).
2-2
2. If there were no mechanism for individual variation in a quantitative trait such as the present response
threshold, the threshold would be normally distributed among individuals at any snap shot observation.
This variation (individuality?) requires no additional factor such as experience or epigenetics. This should
be the null hypothesis that should be tested first, though significant deviations from the normality seem
obvious in both colonies. This will generate an explicit question: What causes this deviation from the
normal distribution? Or it should be cited or explained if this question has been resolved in literature.
Thank you for providing this good criticism. In the revised MS, we made statistical tests for deviations of
the observed threshold distributions from the normal distribution (both distributions are significantly
deviate from normal distributions). Then, we provided several hypotheses that can be the cause of these
characteristic deviations (L272-278).
2-3
3. The second question in this paper should be whether the individual threshold fluctuates over time
beyond the scale of individual variation. This makes clear the null prediction that the individual threshold
randomly fluctuates over time. Although the present data from the two snap shots may not be sufficient, I
wonder if the authors mean to accept this null prediction, which was not very clear from their writing.
Thank you very much an adequate criticism. We conducted an additional test for the normality of the
amount of threshold changes in this experiment. A Shapiro-Wilk test showed that the distribution
deviated significantly from the normality (p=0.01091). Based on this result, we clarified our meaning for
the above point in the MS (L286-291).
2-4
4. I recommend the authors to rethink what the authors mean by “random directions” in lines 285-291,
because of the following reason. If the individual threshold really randomly fluctuates over time, then it
would be logically impossible that the snap-shot distribution of the threshold among clonal ants deviates
from the normality. Instead, the temporal shifts of individual threshold may be generated by some
mechanism that maintains a certain range of individual variation within a colony. Thus the present data
could suggest the presence of this mechanism. I wonder if the authors intended to argue for this
mechanism by “experience” which is assumed for the hypothesis 3 in the paper.
Thank you very much for pointing out these ambiguous parts. We tried to improve this ambiguity in the
revised MS (L294-298).
2-5
5. Very minor comment: English copy-editing would greatly improve this paper.
We are sorry for our poor English. The revised MS has been checked by a native specialist of social
insects (Dr. J Billen; the previous chief editor of Insectes Sociaux (the journal of International Union for
Studies of Social Insects) for English usages. We hope that our responses will be satisfactory for the
reviewers. Again, we much appreciate the efforts of both reviewers to improve our MS.
Sincerely yours,
Eisuke Hasegawa (Ph D.)

Comments to the Author(s)
The English grammar and style needs revision in places. For example, the title would be better as “Adaptive
phenotypic variation among clonal ant workers”, and the running head should not have the leading “A”. A
few other examples: Line 35 should read “decision making” instead of “decision-makings”; Line 70 should
read “a basis of rationality” instead of “a basis of the rationality”; Line 147 should read “to have official
permission” instead of “to have an official permission”. There are many other small issues like these.
The abstract does not specifically mention that sucrose thresholds were assessed. I suggest changing the
sentence at lines 40-41 to read as follows: “…are genetic clones, but they showed variation in sucrose
response thresholds.”
Thank you for your effort to improve the contents of MS. The above points, we followed the reviewer’s
comments (see yellowy highlighted parts). As we are not native English speakers, only the thing we could
do for English improvements was sending the MS to a professional English editing company for English
editing. We hope this will be satisfied the reviewer.
Since colony AC2 provided no data, the clearest thing would be to just leave it out of the paper entirely.
We removed AC2 from the revised version.
It’s not clear which colony provided the re-measurement of thresholds. At line 225, the text says that AC1
was re-measured, but line 286 says that AC1 could be used only for the first measurement, implying that
KC1 was used for re-measurement. This should be clarified.
We are sorry for this confusion. We clarified this point in the revised version (L296-299).
Lines 329-332: I don’t think these new sentences are useful. I suggest cutting them and changing the
sentence at lines 327-329 as follows: “Variation in response threshold can underlie task allocation [4], a
colony’s long-term sustainability [5], and rational collective decision making [6].” My earlier suggestion
was simply to avoid saying that variation is “required” for any of these things. This can be done by small
changes in wording.
We followed your suggestion (L356-358).
Lines 324-339: This new section is out of place. I suggest that you move it elsewhere (for example, after
line 364) and go directly from line 329 to line 341 (as in the original submission).
We moved the focal parts to the suggested position (L355-358).
Lines 347-350: I suggest re-phrasing as follows: “The observed phenotypic variation in clonal S.
membranifera workers may be similarly adaptive for this species, but it is likely to be generated by a
mechanism that is independent of genomic identity (see below).”
We rephrased the parts as followed your suggestions (L367-369).
Lines 350-352: These sentences are out of place. These are alternatives to epigenetic modification as an
explanation for the observed phenotypic variation. It would be better to mention this when you bring up
epigenetics (for example, at line 362 or somewhere in the paragraph at lines 392-407).
We moved the parts to the suggested position (L369-372).
Line 395: What is meant by “how many degrees”?
We clarified the meaning of this point (L402-403).
