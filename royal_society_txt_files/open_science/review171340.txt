This manuscript by Quiroga et al. describes some phosphine platinum(II) complexes with cis and
trans configuration, including the single crystal X-ray diffraction characterization of two of them.
The interaction of the complexes is evaluated versus biological models such as DNA (pBR222 and
CTDNA) and proteins (lysozyme and RNase). The experiments seem to be technically well-
handled. This manuscript should be accepted for publication after minor revision.
Minor comments:
1) The x-axis for the reported 1H NMR spectra (Figure 1) should have the label d(ppm) not f.
2) Relevant reference should also be mentioned, such as: “Interaction of Newly Platinum(II) with
Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine Complex with DNA and Model Lipid Membrane” from Pruchnik
et al. (J Membrane Biol. 2017).

In this work, Echeverri.et.al have investigated the TCEP platinum compounds, their DNA-
binding and antitumor activities (in vitro) are reported. Methodologically, this work is strong,
they tried to provide the mechanism.
However, there are revisions needed before publication in Royal Society Open Science.

(1) In the introduction, the authors said: cisplatin (currently the most efficient metallodrug in the
clinic). The definition of efficient is not clear and cisplatin is not likely to be the most potent
platinum drug for all tumor types.
(2) Cisplatin is water soluble, no need to be improved. The authors have to rewrite the last
paragraph of the introduction to justify their rationale.
(3) Figure 4 is not very convincing because the authors should use CD or LD to uncover the
DNA+Pt binding mode.
(4) The authors should have a section for discussion, it is necessary to compare their two Pt
compounds with other metal drugs in preclinical studies including Ru, Ir and Os compounds
which are targeting DNA. What will be the novelty in this case and what is the question should
be addressed in the future? Can these Pt compounds form inter/intra strand DNA complex? Can
they induce DNA knots? Discussions are needed.

The authors reported two Pt(II) complexes of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and its esterification
derivative. The complexes were well characterized and the structures of two complexes were
determined by X-ray diffraction. The main problem with this ms is that the title of ms does not
conform with the content. The complexes did not exhibit any cytotoxicity and therefore the
modulation of the biological reactivity of the Pt(II) complexes using the phosphine ligand did not
work. The ms may be directed to another journal after excluding the biological work including
DNA/protein interactions.

In this work, Echeverri.et.al have investigated the TCEP platinum
compounds, their DNA-binding and antitumor activities (in vitro) are
reported. Methodologically, this work is strong, they tried to provide
the mechanism.
However, there are revisions needed before publication in Royal
Society Open Science.
(1) In the introduction, the authors said: cisplatin (currently the
most efficient metallodrug in the clinic). The definition of efficient
is not clear and cisplatin is not likely to be the most potent
platinum drug for all tumor types.
The referee is right; cisplatin is very efficient drug in ovarian tumor
but carboplatin is more efficient drug for example in breast cancer
treatment. We have included carboplatin into the introduction
accordingly. Overall, cisplatin mechanism is much further studied and
also its biological values are more available and easier to compare.
(2) Cisplatin is water soluble, no need to be improved. The authors
have to rewrite the last paragraph of the introduction to justify
their rationale.
Although cisplatin is soluble, the perfect solution of such drug needs
of a previous preparation (it does not dissolve immediately), in fact
some of the available preparations in clinic drugs needs the addition
of HCl (cisplatinol)1.

For example, NDC Code(s): 0703-5747-11, 0703-5748-11, Packager: Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc.
https://ndclist.com/ndc/0703-5748/package/0703-5748-11.
As in general the most important problem to solve is the solubility of
manyother platinum potential drugs, we have not specified cisplatin
solubility but referred to platinum compounds solubility.
(3) Figure 4 is not very convincing because the authors should use
CD or LD to uncover the DNA+Pt binding mode.
(4) The authors should have a section for discussion, it is
necessary to compare their two Pt compounds with other metal drugs in
preclinical studies including Ru, Ir and Os compounds which are
targeting DNA. What will be the novelty in this case and what is the
question should be addressed in the future? Can these Pt compounds
form inter/intra strand DNA complex? Can they induce DNA knots?
Discussions are needed.
Referee 2 comments in this regard are very interesting.
CD is particularly well-suited to determine structural changes in DNA.
However, absolute structural content is more difficult to evaluate and
CD will be also not enough to shed light on the questions raised on
point 4. Length-dependencies of the CD spectra of "pure" secondary
structures can be also one potential caveat; thought the information
will be for sure useful.
Inter and intrastrand DNA complex are usually produced by covalent
drugs as cisplatin, and the experiments here performed does not seem
to indicate covalently binding.
We realized that our discussion was scarce in this regard, so we have
followed referee 2 recommendations and extended the discussion. We
have added an extremely recent publication performed with complex 1
that results help to understand some of our experiments. No
cytotoxicity experiments have been published so far, so we believe
that these results enhance the importance of our experiments.
In order to comply with the referee requirements, we have performed a
new experiment with CT-DNA that support our statement of non-covalent
interaction: the measurements of the change on the viscosity of DNA
produced by the complexes. The evaluation of further experiments (by
duplicate) with DNA will required more than two weeks and it will be
difficult to embrace all the different expertizes in one single
manuscript.
Regarding the comparison with other complexes, we believe that
platinum complexes are very different to other metallodrugs containing
Ru, Os, Au… etc . The mechanism of these different metallodrugs are
not fully established and in many cases involve redox reactivity which
is not the case for platinum(II) complexes.
We agree with the referee on the importance of other metallodrugs
different to platinum derivatives in for example biological redox
processes and protein targeting. As these studies have opened up the
research in the field for platinum drugs, we have followed the
referee’s recommendations and extended the introduction to Ru, Os and
Au complexes into the manuscript.

The authors reported two Pt(II) complexes of tris(2-
carboxyethyl)phosphine and its esterification derivative. The
complexes were well characterized and the structures of two complexes
were determined by X-ray diffraction. The main problem with this ms is
that the title of ms does not conform with the content. The complexes
did not exhibit any cytotoxicity and therefore the modulation of the
biological reactivity of the Pt(II) complexes using the phosphine
ligand did not work. The ms may be directed to another journal after
excluding the biological work including DNA/protein interactions.
We apologize for the mistake performed in the supplementary material.
We have corrected and numbered accordingly with the order of manuscript
appearance.The supplementary material uploaded first time included the
cif files and a word file with the corresponding plots and tables of the
crystallography data and UV-Visible absorbance We are uploading just the
SM word file this time as the cif files are available in CSD.
The complexes did not exhibit any cytotoxicity and therefore the
modulation of the biological reactivity of the Pt(II) complexes using
the phosphine ligand did not work.
The referee’s main concerns is related with the cytotoxic effect of
the compounds. We think that we didn’t explain our experiment properly
in the text and that has created confusion. We have re-written the
discussion and are explaining in detail as follows:
We tested the cytotoxicity as a first approach to analyze the effect
on survival on cancer gastric cells lines. We agree that the presented
table does not represent accurately the results and the conclusion of
it. However, we have added the survival curves that clearly
demonstrated the effect on viability. (See at the bottom).
We agree that the effect of complex 2 is poor and the cells required
very high doses to show toxicity, which means that the compound is not
toxic for these cells. However, complex 3 induces a decrease on
viability in a dose dependent manner in both cell lines. It is true
that IC50 is higher compare with CDDP, but Carboplatin, which it is a
cisplatin derivate, approved for clinical used and shows a higher IC50
than cisplatin for these particular cells as well and the therapeutic
value of carboplatin is better in the long term. For instance, in A549
and 4T1 cells IC50 for carboplatin vs Cisplatin is 151 vs 9 and 84,62
vs 9.71.
We think that there is a real need for finding new drugs with lower
side effects than the actual clinical drugs after treatment. Those
side effects are the one of the most important problems with
cisplatin: Effective against a plethora of cancers but with dose
limitations due to collateral tissue targets. We agree that further
studies need to be done in order to proof the biological mechanism of
cytoxicity for our complexes. However the evaluation of the compounds
stability, viability and preliminary interaction with model targets
not only DNA but proteins such as HEWL and RNase are a good initial
results to face the further challenge of finding their underlying
molecular mechanism. We have included in the manuscript the survival
graphs and discuss the results properly in the text.
