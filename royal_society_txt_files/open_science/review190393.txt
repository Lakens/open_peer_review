To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
4
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Punidan Jeyasingh):
This manuscript describes four new species of snails from deep-sea ecosystems. This is a clearly
written manuscript with obvious importance. The manuscript was reviewed by an expert who
was largely happy with it, although concerns about sample size and biogeography were raised.
With much gratitude to the expert reviewer, I invite the authors to address these issues by
providing explicit detail, and acknowledging limitations.

RESPONSE TO THE HANDLING EDITOR (Dr Punidan Jeyasingh)
This manuscript describes four new species of snails from deep-sea ecosystems. This is a clearly
written manuscript with obvious importance. The manuscript was reviewed by an expert who
was largely happy with it, although concerns about sample size and biogeography were raised.
With much gratitude to the expert reviewer, I invite the authors to address these issues by

Thank you very much! We have improved the manuscript according to the suggestions by
the reviewer, as follows, and we hope the present version is acceptable for publication.
RESPONSE TO REVIEWER 1
A few small comments
We are grateful for your constructive review of our manuscript, and we are glad that you are
positive about its publication.
Page 2, line 23. Alviniconcha reaches a size of at least 80 mm
Corrected to ‘over 80 mm in maximum shell height’.
Page 3, line 38. Strength of bleach. Do you mean commercial bleach dliuted with 4 parts of
water? Then one needs to know the strength of the commercial solution, which varies.
Yes this is correct – and we can agree about the strength of the solutions should be stated.
We have therefore modified this sentence as follows:
‘Any remaining soft tissue was cleaned using commercial bleach (concentration
of sodium hypochlorite: 5%) diluted with four parts of water for two to five
minutes until complete dissolution.’
Page 5 line 13. A small sicrepancy between frozen at -20° and page 3 line 30, where it says -80°.
Thanks for spotting this. This should be -20°C. We have corrected the mistake on page 3
line 30.
Page 11, line 12. "spines in that species is much" should be "are much".
Corrected.
Page 12 line 49. I think it should be emphasized that the total number of specimens, records and
localities for the genus is comparatively small which makes zoogeography dissicult.
Many thanks, this is a point well-worth stating. We have added a sentence in this paragraph
to emphasise this idea:
‘This also indicates that the total number of specimens, records, and discovered
localities of the genus is still comparatively small, which makes a comprehensive
understanding of its zoogeography difficult.’
Appendix B
RESPONSE TO THE HANDLING EDITOR (Dr Punidan Jeyasingh)
I thank the authors for addressing reviewer comments and turning this around quickly. I am
happy with it. One remaining issue: Please check links for ZooBank - they are not working.
Many thanks, that’s great. The ZooBank links now made public and they are working. The
GenBank numbers/data are also now public and live.
I will be grateful if you could accept the paper formally.
Thanks again!
Best,
