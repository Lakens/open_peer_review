Appendix A
The manuscript entitled “A categorical perspective towards aerodynamic models for aeroelastic analyses of
bridge decks” proposes a deep, and very interesting, discussion on the most recent developments
concerning the aeroelastic analysis of bridges, ranging from analytical modeling to numerical (CFD-based)
and experimental simulations.
First of all, this reviewer wishes to inform that this review is made (for the first time) after a pre-revision
step in which the same article was already commented and discussed by other reviewers, whose valuable
comments, in anonymous form, are available to this reviewer.
The work is really interesting since clarify several aspects of the modeling approach and the numerical
procedures available in the literature to date on the methods available for performing aeroelastic studies
on bridges. The examples provided to illustrate the aim of the work are clear and well discussed.
The work is, without a doubt, worth to be published.
Only few comments, in particular some suggestion to enrich the discussion on the literature background, is
given next:
1) This reviewer thinks that it is worth to mention also some recent development concerning
analytical models including structural and aerodynamic nonlinearities for the study of the
bifurcation behavior of aeroelastic systems such as bridges undergoing fluid-structure interaction.
In particular, post flutter analyses, including the study of the limit cycle oscillations as well as the
stability regions of the Hopf bifurcation in suspension bridges, have been recently proposed in the
literature.
2) Also the effects, in terms of flutter analysis, of the wind space distribution across long and super-
long spans in suspension bridges is a subject that is worth to be mentioned in this article. Some
recent work available in the literature is worth to be quoted and discussed in the introduction.
3) Last suggestion is to include, still as a comment to enrich the overview of the aeroelastic studies on
bridges performed in the literature to date, some discussion on recent developments (analytical,
numerical or experimental studies) on the control techniques for flutter and post flutter.

Additional comments by “Referee 2” of the original submission to Proc R Soc A
I have made my most detailed comments in response to the original submission, and here I restrict
myself to commenting only on the additional changes that the authors have made in response to
those comments.
The authors (and the corresponding author in particular) have done a very thorough job in
responding to the comments of myself and the other referee. With respect to my own comments, I
am happy with the revisions to the manuscript that have been made.
I still retain some reservations about the way that category theory has been used in this context, but
I believe that the authors’ efforts should be published such that others can decide.
I am happy to recommend that the manuscript be published in its current form, on condition that
the full trail of earlier reviews and responses from the Proc R Soc submission be made available
electronically (although I believe that this is what RSOS will do in any case).

- We greatly value the positive feedback and acceptance of the manuscript by the referee, despite his reservations.
In our response to the first round of review, we attempted to discuss some of his concerns by modifying the
manuscript and offering our extended view in the response. We completely understand his reservations, as we
do acknowledge that such application of the category theory to the engineering practice is not a common practice.
With this in mind, we happily accept to share the reviews and our corresponding comments open to the public.
We endorse any further discussion on the topic and would gladly contribute to it.
Referee 3
The manuscript entitled “A categorical perspective towards aerodynamic models for aeroelastic analyses of bridge
decks” proposes a deep, and very interesting, discussion on the most recent developments concerning the aeroelastic
analysis of bridges, ranging from analytical modeling to numerical (CFD-based) and experimental simulations.
First of all, this reviewer wishes to inform that this review is made (for the first time) after a pre-revision step
in which the same article was already commented and discussed by other reviewers, whose valuable comments, in
anonymous form, are available to this reviewer.
The work is really interesting since clarify several aspects of the modeling approach and the numerical procedures
available in the literature to date on the methods available for performing aeroelastic studies on bridges. The examples
provided to illustrate the aim of the work are clear and well discussed.
The work is, without a doubt, worth to be published.
- We welcome the comments and acceptance by the referee as we attempt to give an alternative approach to
modelling in bridge aerodynamics. Moreover, we highly appreciate that this referee took the time not only
to read the manuscript, but as well the comments and responses from the first round of review, which were
substantial.
Only few comments, in particular some suggestion to enrich the discussion on the literature background, is given
next:
1) This reviewer thinks that it is worth to mention also some recent development concerning analytical models
including structural and aerodynamic nonlinearities for the study of the bifurcation behavior of aeroelastic
systems such as bridges undergoing fluid-structure interaction. In particular, post flutter analyses, including the
study of the limit cycle oscillations as well as the stability regions of the Hopf bifurcation in suspension bridges,
have been recently proposed in the literature.
- It is true that a comment on the influence of the assumptions in the structural model (including their
interaction with the aerodynamic model assumptions) is lacking. To address this point, we have included
the following comment and references (Sec. 3b, line no. 442-446)
The assumption of linearity in the structural model S can have significant influence to the structural be-
haviour along with the aerodynamic model assumptions. This is particularly evident at high wind speeds
and in the post-flutter regime in terms of limit cycle oscillations [1, 3, 7].
The added references include extensive discussions on the effect of structural nonlinearities on the structural
response, with particular emphasis on the critical velocity (i.e. Hopf bifurcation point in nonlinear analysis)
and limit cycle oscillations. Since our main focus is on the aerodynamic models, we believe that these refer-
ences provide good starting point for further reading. In fact, the categorical approach can be also extended
for coupled models that account for the effect of both structural and aerodynamic assumptions simultaneity.
2) Also the effects, in terms of flutter analysis, of the wind space distribution across long and super-long spans in
suspension bridges is a subject that is worth to be mentioned in this article. Some recent work available in the
literature is worth to be quoted and discussed in the introduction.
- The reviewed version of the manuscript included a comment on the effect of three-dimensionality, as pointed
out by Referee 1 in the first round of review. However, as correctly pointed out by the referee, the effect
of variable mean wind profile was not mentioned. Therefore, we modified the comment and including a
corresponding reference [2], in which this issue is thoroughly discussed. Now, the modified comment reads
the following (Sec. 3b, line no. 432-436):
Considering a R2 instead of R3 domain is itself an assumption in terms of the structural behaviour (three
dimensionality of the energy transfer between modes), fluid behaviour (spatial coherence of the free-stream
turbulence, three dimensionality of the turbulent energy cascade and nonuniform mean wind profile along
the bridge span) and FSI (strip assumption) [5, 4, 2].
We note that, this comment is in Sec 3b and not in the Introduction, as pointed out by the referee, since
the initial comment on three dimensionality was in this section. We hope that the referee agrees with this
minor restructuring.
3) Last suggestion is to include, still as a comment to enrich the overview of the aeroelastic studies on bridges per-
formed in the literature to date, some discussion on recent developments (analytical, numerical or experimental
studies) on the control techniques for flutter and post flutter.
- To address this remark, we have included two references and the following comment in the manuscript
(Sec.1, line no. 30-32):
Therein, it is shown that the aerodynamic assumptions can significantly influence the structural response.
Consequently, the choice of aerodynamic model impacts mitigation strategies such as active and passive
control (cf., e.g., [3, 6]).
Since the pivotal point of this work are the aerodynamic model assumptions, we included a brief comment on
control measures only to relate them with these assumptions. The topic of control measures involves a vast
literature, and an extensive discussion on it represents a study of its own. However, the provided references
offer substantial insight on topic of aerodynamic control. Moreover, these references are in line with the
subject of this study as they include the effects of nonlinearity (i.e., aerodynamic model assumptions).
