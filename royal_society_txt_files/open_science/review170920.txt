This paper reported a new double perovskite LaNaMnMoO6 material system. The work is
systematically presented and the characterizations are carefully carried out. However, there are
several issues should be addressed before publication.
Major comments:
(1) Though LaNaMnMoO6 is a new double perovskites, the reason why it possesses a giant
magnetoresistance effect is not clearly discussed.
(2) The motivation of the present work is not clear. The reason why LaNaMnMoO6 is selected is
unknown.
(3) The present data should be reorganized. The logic of the data is not clear, e.g., why first
discuss magnetic properties and then electric properties
Minor comments:
(1) Several figures are not clear. Please double check.
(2) A comparison should be made for the properties between LaNaMnMoO6 and the state-of-the-
art double perovskites.
(3) "This result (large MR at room temperature and at low magnetic field) isexplained by the
effect of grain boundaries." The reason should be more specific.

Manuscript Ref. No: RSOS-170920
Dear editor,
Let us express our gratitude for considering the manuscript Ref. No RSOS-
170920 entitled:
“Structural, magnetic and electrical properties of a new
double perovskite LaNaMnMoO6 material”
We would also like to thank all the referees for the time they spent investigating our
manuscript and for their helpful comments. Below, you will find our responses to each point
aised in the referees’ reports as requested by the Editorial Office.
NB: according to reviewer 1; the figures are not clear, therefore we have redone almost all
igures such as: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8(a), 9, 10 and 11
n order to better see the figures, I have taken out all the inset figures outside the figures, and I
assigned them numbers:
<U+F0B7> Inset of figure 1 was so numbered by figure 1(b). This is induces a change in the
number of figure1(b) and 1(c) to the 1(c) and 1(d) respectively.
<U+F0B7> We have attributed the number 9(b) for inset of figure9. Therefore, figure9 was
numerated by 9(a).
<U+F0B7> we have done the same for figure11:
Figure 11was therefore numbered by Figure 11(a)
Inset of figure 11 was numbered by 11(b)
During my review of my manuscript, I noticed that in the captions figures section and more
precisely in figure 10: it is written "The inset show the Fit parameters of equation 10". This is
why I added in Figure 10 the table of the parameters of fit.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper reported a new double perovskite LaNaMnMoO6 material system. The work is
systematically presented and the characterizations are carefully carried out. However, there
are several issues should be addressed before publication.
Major comments:
Question1
(1) Though LaNaMnMoO6 is a new double perovskites, the reason why it possesses a
giant magnetoresistance effect is not clearly discussed.
Response
The reason for the improved MR property in this compound arises primarily from the fact that
LaNaMnMoO6 has a high magnetic ordering temperature (~320 K) as compared with
manganites.
Question2
(2) The motivation of the present work is not clear. The reason why LaNaMnMoO6 is
selected is unknown.
Response
Many researchers have reported the structural, magnetic and electrical properties of the
double perovskite transition-metal oxides, especially for the Fe-based compounds. To our
knowledge, no studies have been carried on A’A”MnMoO6 where A’ and A” are,
espectively trivalent rare earth and monovalent alkali elements. In this work, we studied the
structural, magnetic and electrical properties of LaNaMnMoO6 powder double perovskite
sample.
Question3
(3) The present data should be reorganized. The logic of the data is not clear, e.g., why
first discuss magnetic properties and then electric properties
Response
Generally in perovskites or double perovskites, the discussion of magnetic properties takes
place before that of the electrical properties. You can see these references below as an
example:
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssc.2014.12.001
https://doi.org/10.1557/jmr.2016.112
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physb.2014.04.057
Minor comments:
Question1
(1) Several figures are not clear. Please double check.
Response
You are quite right. We have corrected this in the revised manuscript at the figure section. So
we have done again Figures 1, 2, 9 and 11.
Question2
(2) A comparison should be made for the properties between LaNaMnMoO6 and the
state-of-the-art double perovskites.
Response
Yes you are absolutely right, but:
From a structural point of view, this comparison is found in Table 3: our compound
crystallizes in the orthorhombic structure whereas its homologue Sr2MnMoO6 crystallizes in
he cubic structure.
magnetically, our oxide is ferromagnetic at low temperature. Such ferromagnetic behavior
has not been observed in the homologous Sr2MnMoO6 sample (we can see the reference [24]
n our manuscript). We have added this magnetic comparison in the revised manuscript
The electrical properties of our compound show that it is metallic at low temperatures,
whereas Sr2MnMoO6 is an insulator [24]. We have also added this electrical comparison in
he revised manuscript
Question3
(3) "This result (large MR at room temperature and at low magnetic field) is explained by
the effect of grain boundaries." The reason should be more specific.
Response
ntense research activities have been focused on the ferromagnetic double perovskites
Sr2FeMoO6 due to large change in low field magneto-resistance (LFMR) at room
emperature, where the spin-dependent scattering occurs at the grain boundaries (GBs).
You can see the references below :
<U+F0B7> K. I. Kobayashi, T. Kimura, H. Sawada, K. Terakura, and Y. Tokura, Nature 395, 677
(1998).
<U+F0B7> D. D. Sarma, P. Mahadevan, T. D. Saha, S. Ray, and A. Kumar, Phys. Rev. Lett. 85,
2549 (2000).
The observed magnetoresistance (LFMR) has also been associated with electron tunnelling
hrough the insulator barriers formed at the grain boundaries (GBs).
You can see the reference below :
<U+F0B7> W Zhong, W Liu, C T Au and Y W Du, Tunnelling magnetoresistance of double
perovskite Sr2FeMoO6 enhanced by grain boundary adjustment. Nanotechnology 17
(2006) 250–256 (doi:10.1088/0957-4484/17/1/042)
Except these two models it was also suggested that spin-polarized tunneling and spin
scattering at interfaces play a relative minor role and that the dominant low-field contribution
o the MR stems from the mesoscale response of magnetic inhomogeneities induced by the
GB.
You can see the reference below :
<U+F0B7> Yunhui XU, Grain-Boundary Effect on Low-Field Magnetoresistance in Perovskite
Manganites. Journal of the GCPD e.V. 6 December 2000.
The LFMR in such systems can be enhanced by reducing the grain size, by addition of
different cations at different sites, due to the presence of impurities, modified magnetic
structure, and also due to modification of grain boundaries by introducing the second phase
materials. We can see the reference below
