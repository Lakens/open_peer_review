Main points:
1) The authors are probably well aware that there are 2 kinds of aftereffects: 1) contrast-effects
(a.k.a. ‘selective speech adaptation’) that are mainly driven by the unambiguous acoustic nature
of the adapting stimulus and 2) assimilative effects (a.k.a. recalibration or perceptual learning)
that are mainly driven by the audio-visual discrepancy of the adaptor. (Bertelson, Vroomen, & de
Gelder, 2003). A McGurk stimulus with auditory CLEAR speech (instead of an ambiguous
phoneme halfway between /b/ and /d/) may produce aftereffects for contrastive or assimilative
reasons. Here, the authors found assimilative effects with McGurk adapters, but both Saldana
and Rosenblum, and Roberts and Summerfield were looking for CONTRAST-effects (not
recalibration) with audio-clear McGurk stimuli and found NO effect of lipread speech. In the
same vein , (Samuel & Lieblich, 2014) and van Linden (2007) used McGurk stimuli with auditory
clear adaptors and again found NO effect of lipread speech on contrast-effects. Lumping these
references together, as on Page 2, line 2 (refs 3-5) is in my view not helpful, and I’d rather invite
the authors to speculate about this conflict in the literature.
2) Page 5, line 38: Please comment: Why are the analyses relative to auditory /ada/, and not
auditory /aba/, which is in fact the auditory part of the McGurk stimulus? It diminishes the
recalibration effect. To me it seems that conclusions are quite different if auditory /ba/ is baseline
(i.e., there is always recalibration if test stimulus has noise).
Minors:
1) Page 2: Line12-15 ‘We hypothesized that recalibration may only occur when the McGurk
illusion was perceived, thus if auditory and visual inputs were fused to ‘ada’.’ There is actually
some support for that in (van Linden & Vroomen, 2007) who report that the size of lipread bias in
the adapter is correlated with the size of recalibration effect.
2) Please comment: The noise on the test stimulus increased priming (much more /d/-responses
after auditory /d/ than auditory /d/). Any reasons why?
3) Page 9: Line 38: Extreme stimulus-specificity of phonetic recalibration was also demonstrated
in (Keetels, Pecoraro, & Vroomen, 2015)
4) Page 10; final paragraph: A consistent finding in the literature is that lipread recalibration is
STRONGER than lexical recalibration, despite the fact that the lipread context is LESS
constraining than lexical context (van Linden & Vroomen, 2007). As an example, lip closure may
signal either /b/, /p/, or /m/, whereas (in Dutch) a phoneme halfway between t/p can only be
/t/ in the context of ‘idoot/p’ and /p/ in the context of ‘bioscoot/p’. I am curious how that
might be incorporated in a Bayesian model.
5) I really prefer to see the raw data in the paper, not as a supplement.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors conducted a study of how perception of the McGurk Illusion affects subsequent
perception. The works goes beyond previous work in multisensory recalibration of auditory
perception by specifically looking at the impact of whether a McGurk stimulus is reported as
"ada" vs. "aba." The authors also looked at the contribution of auditory noise to the recalibration
process. Using a signal detection theory approach, the authors attempt to ascribe the changes in
perception to changes in sensitivity and criterion. I found the results mostly compelling and the
experimental design (within-participant design and reasonable sample size) is adequate to the
problem at hand.
I have three major concerns with the paper, all potentially fixable in a revision.
4
First, the later analyses seem to invalidate the initial analyses. If the percept on a previous
McGurk trial is critical for recalibration, than the initial analyses that collapse over percept are
misleading. Similarly, collapsing across noise types for the d' analysis is not justified because a
conclusion of the paper is that performance is different depending on low/high noise. I
understand that there may not be enough trials to stably estimate d' if conditions are not
collapsed, but that means the analysis cannot be done, not that you can combine data from
incompatible conditions. Fixing this problem necessitates redoing the statistical and d' analyses. It
is insufficient to just present the final analysis, as it does not include all factors in the
experimental design. Additionally, figure S1 needs to be remade, as it combines previous
condition McGurk-Correct and McGurk-Incorrect trials.
Second, the authors do not show individual data. Because of the stated individual differences,
graphically displaying the effect at an individual level will allow readers to appreciate the
robustness of the result and whether floor/ceiling effects may be responsible for the lack of a
given effect. See the included figure for a quick attempt at what I mean (this is a quick figure, the
data may be processed incorrectly. p-values are for a non-par Wilcoxon signed-rank between the
stated conditions). As shown by the attached graph, any effects can be clearly seen--and can be
more convincing than bar graphs which do not show single subject trends. Because of the large
number of experimental conditions in the data, having many panels seems justified, rather than
trying to show all lines in a single panel. (Appendix A)
Third, the authors suggest that stimulus similarity is critical for recalibration to occur. If that is
the case, then there should NOT be recalibration for /ada/ trials following a McGurk stimulus.
Figure 3 seems to show that %ada when previous trial is McGurk > %ada when previous trial is
aba. The authors should specifically address this, as it suggests that a response bias (respond on
trial N like you did on trial N-1) may account for some the results.
Secondary Issues
The authors note that the initial analyses replicated their previous finding. The later analyses
suggest recalibration occurs when McGurk stimuli are perceived as ada, rather than aba. Can the
previous data be re-analyzed to show a similar pattern?
The similar criterion for /ada/ trials as for McGurk trials makes it harder to say that there is a
criterion shift -- What is the baseline, i.e., shifting compared to what? Wouldn't it make as much
sense to say that the criterion was stable for /ada/ and McGurk trials but shifted positive for
/aba/ trials?
If recalibration is occuring, then will there be an effect on trial n+1 as well? If /aba/ is heard as
/ada/ then what happens following a mis-perceived trial? At least in the noisy condition, there
might be enough trials to measure this effect.
p4, line 7: unless you did eye tracking, say that a fixation cross was displayed, rather than saying
that subjects fixated
p4, line 54-55: The noise is a high/low here rather than present/absent as in other places. Please
clarify
page 5, line 36 Phrases like "was strongly dependent" should be used to descirbe the size of an
effect, not the associated p-value (which can be quite low regardless of actual effectr size). Please
rephrase or include an effect size estimate
5
p5, line 37: The degrees of freedom are probably flipped here, and in several places the
denominator degrees of freedom are listed first. This is non-standard and should be corrected.
p6, line 13: After describing why n=45, the t-test has 46 degrees of freedom. Also, this test is
described as RM ANOVA? Please clarify.
p6, line 34: why is the sample size n=49 if only 4 subjects were excluded? Initial sample size was
reported as 54. Please clarify.
p6, line 44: please check this value: 0.9e-4 -- to be consistent with how other results are reported,
shouldn't this be 9e-5 ?
p8, line 12: saying "regularly" misperceived is too vague -- be specific about the magnitude of the
change here.

stantially improved our paper. We will respond to each of the reviewers’ points below.

authors are probably well aware that there are 2 kinds of aftereffects: 1) contrast-effects (a.k.a.
ective speech adaptation’) that are mainly driven by the unambiguous acoustic nature of the
pting stimulus and 2) assimilative effects (a.k.a. recalibration or perceptual learning) that are mainly
en by the audio-visual discrepancy of the adaptor. (Bertelson, Vroomen, & de Gelder, 2003). A
Gurk stimulus with auditory CLEAR speech (instead of an ambiguous phoneme halfway between /b/
/d/) may produce aftereffects for contrastive or assimilative reasons. Here, the authors found
milative effects with McGurk adapters, but both Saldana and Rosenblum, and Roberts and
merfield were looking for CONTRAST-effects (not recalibration) with audio-clear McGurk stimuli and
nd NO effect of lipread speech. In the same vein, (Samuel & Lieblich, 2014) and van Linden (2007)
d McGurk stimuli with auditory clear adaptors and again found NO effect of lipread speech on
trast-effects. Lumping these references together, as on Page 2, line 2 (refs 3-5) is in my view not
ful, and I’d rather invite the authors to speculate about this conflict in the literature.
p. We agree with the reviewer that mixing together citations that refer to different types of
reffects might be confusing. Now, in this part of the manuscript we specifically discuss and refer to
dies that investigated the speech recalibration aftereffect. We have also added some discussion
ut the conditions under which recalibration and adaptation are likely to be observed (Page 12). A
or that is likely of importance here is the duration of exposure to the adapting stimulus (see below).
r study replicates previous findings showing that conflicting visual context induces strong speech
libration aftereffects [1,3,35] . However, it is important to note that we did not find selective speech
ptation, which is another type of aftereffect [36]: Hearing /aba/ frequently can induce adaptation,
reasing the likelihood of perceiving /aba/ in subsequent trials. We did not observe a reduction of
a’ responses following auditory /aba/ trials compared to following auditory /ada/ trials (where no
ptation neither recalibration is expected). Importantly, the reduction in ‘aba’ reports was specific to
se trials following an illusory McGurk trial. Therefore, we believe that the increment in ‘ada’
onses after illusory McGurk trials can only be accounted for by recalibration and not by a process of
ctive speech adaptation. We speculate that the absence of adaption effects in our experiment might
ue to the use of a rapid recalibration design, where the adaptors randomly varied in each trial.
ereas assimilative effects can take place with just one trial of conflict exposure, contrastive effects
ally require longer exposure periods than a single trial to build up [21,37]. “
e 5, line 38: Please comment: Why are the analyses relative to auditory /ada/, and not auditory
a/, which is in fact the auditory part of the McGurk stimulus? It diminishes the recalibration effect. To
it seems that conclusions are quite different if auditory /ba/ is baseline (i.e., there is always
libration if test stimulus has noise).
p. In our analyses we decided to choose “previous /ada/” instead of “previous /aba/” as a baseline
ause /ada/ is perceptually similar to the McGurk illusion percept. Thus, it seems a more appropriate
eline to compare the proportion of ‘ada’ reports after a McGurk illusion trial against the proportion
ada’ reports after an /ada/ trial instead of an /aba/ trial, in order to keep the history of percept
her than the stimulus) the same. Using this analysis strategy also enabled us to replicate a previous
ult (Lüttke et al., 2016), in which we used the same analysis strategy.
e 2: Line12-15 ‘We hypothesized that recalibration may only occur when the McGurk illusion was
ceived, thus if auditory and visual inputs were fused to ‘ada’.’ There is actually some support for that
an Linden & Vroomen, 2007) who report that the size of lipread bias in the adapter is correlated with
size of recalibration effect.
p. We thank the reviewer for pointing us to this reference. We have now added this reference in
e 9: “In line with our results, in (van Linden & Vroomen 2007) showed that the strength of
libration aftereffect is highly determined by the percept during adaptor. Specifically, they showed
t the size of the bias induced by lexical context in a phoneme categorization task was positively
elated with the strength of the induced aftereffect.”
se comment: The noise on the test stimulus increased priming (much more /d/-responses after
itory /d/ than auditory /d/). Any reasons why?
p. Increasing the sensory noise increases perceptual uncertainty. This makes the participants more
ceptible to be biased by previous information. This effect has been previously shown in
rahamyan, Luz, Dakin, Carandini, & Gardner, 2016) where they showed that the magnitude of the
ice history biases is inversely proportional to the strength of sensory stimulus. Now we have added
he main text:
oreover, the proportion of ‘ada’ and ‘aba’ responses was more biased in the direction of the percept
he previous trial in the high noise conditions. These results demonstrate that our acoustic noise
nipulation effectively increased sensory uncertainty, showing a decreased performance in phoneme
rimination and increments in perceptual priming under high noise stimulation [15].”
e 9: Line 38: Extreme stimulus-specificity of phonetic recalibration was also demonstrated in (Keetels,
oraro, & Vroomen, 2015)
p. We have added this reference on page 10: “Phonetic recalibration aftereffects have been found to
only be phoneme or speaker specific, but also ear specific [32]. Keetels et al. showed that the same
biguous sound can be simultaneously adapted to two opposing phonemic interpretations if presented
he left and right ear. “
e 10; final paragraph: A consistent finding in the literature is that lipread recalibration is STRONGER
n lexical recalibration, despite the fact that the lipread context is LESS constraining than lexical
text (van Linden & Vroomen, 2007). As an example, lip closure may signal either /b/, /p/, or /m/,
reas (in Dutch) a phoneme halfway between t/p can only be /t/ in the context of ‘idoot/p’ and /p/ in
context of ‘bioscoot/p’. I am curious how that might be incorporated in a Bayesian model.
p. Thanks for the suggestion. We comment on how the Bayesian model can account for this counter-
itive difference in recalibration:
onsistent finding in the literature is that lipread recalibration is usually stronger than lexical
libration (van Linden & Vroomen, 2007). This might appear counter-intuitive from a Bayesian belief-
ating model, given that lexical context is more constraining than lipread context (e.g. a lip closure
y signal either /b/, /p/ or /m/). This may lead to the a priori prediction that the less ambiguous lexical
text should update the observer’s belief more strongly than lipread context, leading to stronger
libration aftereffects. We speculate that a possible explanation for this asymmetry in recalibration
ngth might be related to the degree of estimated causal link for conflicting information derived from
ead and lexical contexts. We propose that integrating auditory speech and lipread context (McGurk
ion) involves the assumption of a more direct causal link between both sources of information than
integration of higher-level phonetic representations (lexical recalibration). Unlike lexical context,
ead and auditory phonetic stimuli generally hold very consistent spatiotemporal correlations (i.e.
itory speech signals and lipread signals unfold over time and contain both dynamic configural
rmation and local motion cues). That makes that conflicts between lipread and auditory signals can
esolved at the stimulus level, reinforcing the unity assumption between the two external sources of
netic information. Assuming a stronger causal link between lipread and auditory information can
lain why a listener updates its /aba/ distribution more often in the case of lipread recalibration
adigms, leading to stronger recalibration effects compared to lexical recalibration paradigms.”
ally prefer to see the raw data in the paper, not as a supplement.
p. We appreciate this comment, and have added the raw data into the main body of the manuscript.
have improved the figure by including the single subject observations on top of the group averages.

authors conducted a study of how perception of the McGurk Illusion affects subsequent perception.
works goes beyond previous work in multisensory recalibration of auditory perception by specifically
ing at the impact of whether a McGurk stimulus is reported as "ada" vs. "aba." The authors also
ed at the contribution of auditory noise to the recalibration process. Using a signal detection theory
roach, the authors attempt to ascribe the changes in perception to changes in sensitivity and
erion. I found the results mostly compelling and the experimental design (within-participant design
reasonable sample size) is adequate to the problem at hand. I have three major concerns with the
er, all potentially fixable in a revision.
p. We appreciate the interest of the reviewer in our study. We have addressed all the points to the
t of our abilities.
t, the later analyses seem to invalidate the initial analyses. If the percept on a previous McGurk trial is
cal for recalibration, then the initial analyses that collapse over percept are misleading. Similarly,
apsing across noise types for the d' analysis is not justified because a conclusion of the paper is that
ormance is different depending on low/high noise. I understand that there may not be enough trials
tably estimate d' if conditions are not collapsed, but that means the analysis cannot be done, not that
can combine data from incompatible conditions. Fixing this problem necessitates redoing the
istical and d' analyses. It is insufficient to just present the final analysis, as it does not include all
ors in the experimental design. Additionally, figure S1 needs to be remade, as it combines previous
dition McGurk-Correct and McGurk-Incorrect trials.
p. We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to these important issues. We agree that
apsing over percept is not desirable since the percept on a previous McGurk trial is critical for
alibration. Therefore, we did actually not collapse over percept, in other words McGurk trials that
e fused (‘ada’ percept) and not fused (‘aba’ percept) were never analysed together. We have
ified this now in the analysis section (underlined part):
e were interested in the effect of the previous trial on the percept on the current trial. Therefore, we
ed at the percept on auditory /aba/ and /ada/ trials that were preceded by either /aba/, /ada/ or
Gurk illusion (‘ada’ percept). Only when addressing the question whether it is necessary for
libration to fuse McGurk stimuli we split McGurk trials into fused (‘ada’ percept) and nonfused trials
a’ percept). For all remaining questions we restricted the analysis to fused McGurk trials.” Along the
e lines, the data that is shown in the new figure 3 only displays McGurk-illusion trials.
ond, the authors do not show individual data. Because of the stated individual differences, graphically
laying the effect at an individual level will allow readers to appreciate the robustness of the result

a quick attempt at what I mean (this is a quick figure, the data may be processed incorrectly. p-values

effects can be clearly seen--and can be more convincing than bar graphs which do not show single
ject trends. Because of the large number of experimental conditions in the data, having many panels
ms justified, rather than trying to show all lines in a single panel.
p. Following the reviewer suggestion we have generated the raw data figure again including the
le subjects observations. Moreover, this figure has now been transferred to the main body of the
nuscript following the recommendation of reviewer 1. As pointed out by reviewer 2, now it is
sible to appreciate better the data distributions and the robustness of the results across the different
ditions. We want to thank reviewer 2 for generating example figures to illustrate the advantages of
ting the individual data.
d, the authors suggest that stimulus similarity is critical for recalibration to occur. If that is the case,
n there should NOT be recalibration for /ada/ trials following a McGurk stimulus. Figure 3 seems to
w that %ada when previous trial is McGurk > %ada when previous trial is aba. The authors should
cifically address this, as it suggests that a response bias (respond on trial N like you did on trial N-1)
y account for some the results.
p. We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. As pointed out by the reviewer, in Figure 3.B,
re is a significant response bias which is not necessarily attributable to recalibration. One of the main
ectives of this study was to use signal detection theory (SDT) to tease apart decision/response biases
m perceptual recalibration. As it is represented in Figure 3.A, and in line with the reviewer’s point,
criterion parameter after a McGurk stimulus was lower than after an ‘aba’ stimulus. That is,
ticipants were more liberal in responding ‘ada’ if they had experienced an illusory ‘ada’ in the
vious trial than if they had experienced an ‘aba’ stimulus. Uniquely after a fused McGurk stimulus,
ceptual recalibration took place, resulting in a diminished ability to distinguish between /aba/ and
a/ stimuli (reduced d-prime). Thus, we believe that by using SDT we have been able to nicely capture
decision/response biases present in our data (independently of perceptual recalibration). In the
nuscript we comment on the presence of response biases in different points.
ults section (p.5): “We also observed a significant effect of the previous trial on the criterion
,52)=58.93,p=4.3e-14, see Fig. 4A). Subjects were biased towards ‘ada’ following either a McGurk
ion (C=-0.40, SD=0.35) or an /ada/ trial (C=-0.37, SD=0.36), and towards ‘aba’ following an /aba/
l (C=0.15, SD=0.33).”
ussion section (p.8): “While there was a general decision bias towards the percept on the previous
l (reflected in a more liberal criterion to report ‘ada’ following /ada/ and McGurk trials), only after a
d McGurk we found decreased sensitivity, indicative of perceptual recalibration.”
authors note that the initial analyses replicated their previous finding. The later analyses suggest
libration occurs when McGurk stimuli are perceived as ada, rather than aba. Can the previous data
e-analyzed to show a similar pattern?
p. We agree with the reviewer that an analysis of the earlier dataset would be interesting to support
conclusions of the present manuscript. Unfortunately, the previous study (Lüttke, Ekman, van
ven & de Lange, 2016) preselected individuals with a high susceptibility to the McGurk illusion. 87%
he McGurk stimuli were perceived as ‘ada’. Therefore, there are too few data points for non-fused
Gurk trials,preventing us from re-analysing the previous dataset.
similar criterion for /ada/ trials as for McGurk trials makes it harder to say that there is a criterion
t -- What is the baseline, i.e., shifting compared to what? Wouldn't it make as much sense to say that
criterion was stable for /ada/ and McGurk trials but shifted positive for /aba/ trials?
p. We apologize for the confusion. The reviewer is right about what is the best way to describe the
erion changes in our results. In order to describe the direction of the criterion shift (positive or
ative), we must describe a reference condition. Now, to prevent further confusion we took two
roaches along the manuscript:
1) When describing our results, we always mention what is the condition that we use as a
reference to compare the change in criterion. For example:
“After experiencing a McGurk illusion the criterion was more shifted towards /aba/ than after
experiencing a nonfused McGurk or an ‘aba’ trial, and thereby increased the proportion of ‘ada’
responses. “
2) We rephrase the interpretation of what a positive or negative shift in the criterion means (e.g.
the participants were more liberal in responding ‘ada’ when in the previous trial they were
presented with a real or an illusory ‘ada’ compared to when they were presented with an ‘aba’
stimulus). For example:
“The criterion to report ‘ada’ after a fused McGurk (M=-0.31, SD=0.30) was more liberal (more
‘ada’ responses) while after a nonfused McGurk it was more conservative (less ‘ada’ responses;
M=0.18, SD=0.25; fused vs. nonfused: F(1,30)=85.26, p=2.83e-10, see Fig. 4)”
calibration is occurring, then will there be an effect on trial n+1 as well? If /aba/ is heard as /ada/
n what happens following a mis-perceived trial? At least in the noisy condition, there might be
ugh trials to measure this effect.
p. The reviewer suggests to look at what happens after a trial where the subject misperceived an
a/ trial after experiencing the McGurk illusion (that is, after a recalibrated trial). Following her/his
ommendation, we have performed additional analyses comparing the perception on /aba/ and /ada/
ls after a recalibrated trial (i.e. following an illusory McGurk, /aba/ is perceived as ‘ada’), after a non-
alibrated trial (i.e. following an illusory McGurk, /aba/ is perceived as ‘aba’) and after an /ada/ trial
following an illusory McGurk, /ada/ is perceived as ‘ada’).
details of this new analysis can be found in the supplementary materials. Moreover, now in the
nuscript discussion we interpret this analysis as additional evidence for the belief-updating model
ge 11):
e updated model should continue incorporating new evidence. We therefore speculate on the
sistence of the recalibration effect on adjacent trials. Two consecutively misperceived /aba/ sounds
ring McGurk and recalibrated /aba/) should strengthen the updated belief (shift towards /d/).
ever, new counterevidence (/aba/ perceived as ‘aba’) after a McGurk illusion should weaken this
ef (shift towards /b/). In an exploratory analysis (see Supplementary material) we tested this
othesis. We compared /aba/ trials after McGurk induced recalibration with /aba/ trials after correctly
ceived /aba/. We observed that even two trials after a McGurk illusion, the probability that /aba/ was
perceived as ‘ada’ was larger after a misperceived /aba/ than after correct /aba/. This result provides
itional support for the belief-updating model. If new incoming evidence after a McGurk illusion is
dically interpreted (i.e. /aba/ stimulus = ‘aba’ percept), the prior /b/ distribution is shifted less
ards the /d/ distribution than after a recalibrated /aba/ that was perceived as ‘ada’. “
line 7: unless you did eye tracking, say that a fixation cross was displayed, rather than saying that
jects fixated
p. We thank the reviewer for pointing out this inaccurate phrasing. We have adjusted it in the
nuscript.
line 54-55: The noise is a high/low here rather than present/absent as in other places. Please clarify
p. We now consistently refer to low and high noise throughout the manuscript (see page 5 + Fig. 3).
e 5, line 36 Phrases like "was strongly dependent" should be used to describe the size of an effect, not
associated p-value (which can be quite low regardless of actual effect size). Please rephrase or
ude an effect size estimate
p. We agree with the reviewer and now also report the effect size (<U+03B7>2partial=0.54), which we think
ports our claim that perception strongly depended on both the current and previous stimulus.
line 37: The degrees of freedom are probably flipped here, and in several places the denominator
rees of freedom are listed first. This is non-standard and should be corrected.
p. We thank the reviewer for spotting this non-standard way of reporting the ANOVA results. We are
reporting the denominator degrees of freedom first throughout the manuscript (e.g. F(2,52)).
line 13: After describing why n=45, the t-test has 46 degrees of freedom. Also, this test is described as
ANOVA? Please clarify.
p. We thank the reviewer for pointing out this inconsistency. We have now removed the faulty
thoc t-test from the manuscript and only report the significant interaction effect between current ×
vious stimulus of the RM ANOVA showing that participants were more confident about a
perceived /aba/ after a McGurk illusion and more confident about a misperceived /ada/ after /ada/.
line 34: why is the sample size n=49 if only 4 subjects were excluded? Initial sample size was reported
4. Please clarify.
p. We apologize for this mistake. Five subjects were excluded for the analysis, because they
ceived the McGurk illusion on all trials. We corrected this in the manuscript now.
line 44: please check this value: 0.9e-4 -- to be consistent with how other results are reported,
uldn't this be 9e-5?
p. Indeed, thank you. We have changed the p-value accordingly (p=8.8e-5).
line 12: saying "regularly" misperceived is too vague -- be specific about the magnitude of the change
e.
p. We have added the percentages of misperceived /aba/ trials after fused and non-fused McGurk
ls to be more explicit about the magnitude (p.8).
ecifically, we found that immediately after experiencing the McGurk illusion, but less after failing to
ceive the illusion (21%), auditory /aba/ was regularly misperceived as ‘ada’ (35%).”
