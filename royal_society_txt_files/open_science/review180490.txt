Review comments on “Effect of carboxylic group on the compatibility with retarder and the
retarding side effect of the fluid loss control additive used in oil well cement”
The topic of this paper is interesting. However, some revisions and or explanations should be
addressed.
1. The main object of this paper is to prepare some copolymers. As well-known that, polymer gel
sealant can also be used for fluid loss control during well completion or cementing. eg. Tavassoli,
S., Ho, J. F., Shafiei, M., Huh, C., Bommer, P., Bryant, S., & Balhoff, M. T. (2018). Fuel, 217, 444-
457; Jia, H., Chen, H., & Guo, S. (2017). Fuel, 210, 207-216.; Jia, H., & Chen, H. (2018). SPE
Production & Operations. SPE-189460-PA; Jia, H., & Chen, H. (2018). Journal of Petroleum
Science and Engineering, 165, 105-113.; Li, M., Xie, D., Guo, Z., Lu, Y., & Guo, X. (2017).
International Journal of Polymer Science, 2017.
These references should be added in background to improve the readability of this paper.
2. In page 3, why the introduction of carboxyl acid group in FLCA could improve the
compatibility between FLCA and dispersant? More literatures should be added to support this
view.
3. As well-known that, more carboxyl acid ground will bring out high viscosity for the synthesis
polymer. Why focus on this topic?
4. In materials section, it is better to added other information such as net weight, analytical grade
or industrial grade etc.
5. In Fig.3, there are only four points for IA, why not add more data for this curve?
6. More information about fluid loss evaluation method should be added in this paper. The
authors need to explain their results in more detail.
7. Remove “The effect of the type and content of carboxylic acid group on the retarding side effect
of FLCA and the compatibility between FLCA and the retarder AMPS-IA synthesized by AMPS
and IA was studied in this paper. Several conclusions could be obtained by the study in this
paper.” in conclusion.

The effect of carboxylic group on the compatibility with retarder and the retarding side effect of
the fluid loss control additive used in oil well cement was presented in this paper. This type of
work is relevant because it is a very attractive technique to practice application. The manuscript
was concise but certainly complete with all necessary discussions, and the data indeed supports
the conclusions. However, there are a few suggestions for minor revision as follow for its
usability if these issues can be satisfactorily clarified.
(1) The temperature of the oil well is very high normally. Thus API fluid loss of the fluid loss
control additive containing maleic acid under different temperature should be given in this
paper.
(2)The figure quality is a little bad. Thus the figure should be improved.
(3)The written English language of the manuscript must be professionally proofread and edited.
(4) The method for cement slurry preparation should be described more in detail.
(5) I am confused why the API static fluid loss is as twice much as the collected filtrate volume.
(6) Present the methodology adding more details as the vicat apparatus etc.
(7) The method for intrinsic viscosity number should be described more in detail.

These references should be added in background to improve the readability of this
paper.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s suggestion. References have been added
accordingly.
2. In page 3, why the introduction of carboxyl acid group in FLCA could improve the
compatibility between FLCA and dispersant? More literatures should be added to
support this view.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s suggestion. More literatures have been added
accordingly.
3. As well-known that, more carboxyl acid ground will bring out high viscosity for the
synthesis polymer. Why focus on this topic?
Response: Thanks for the referee’s suggestion. The viscosity of the polymer may
increase with the content of the carboxyl acid group increasing, but the effect of
carboxyl acid group on the adsorption ability and the chelating ability of the
polymer is also very obvious. The adsorption ability is very important to the fluid
loss control ability of the polymer. The adsorption ability and the chelating ability
are very important to the retarding ability of the polymer. The fluid loss control
ability and the retarding ability is very important to the cementing operation
security, so this topic was chosen in this paper.
4. In materials section, it is better to add other information such as net weight,
analytical grade or industrial grade etc.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s suggestion. More information have been added
accordingly.
5. In Fig.3, there are only four points for IA, why not add more data for this curve?
Response: Thanks for the referee’s suggestion. Five points (including the initial
point) existed in the curve for IA. If the feed ratio of IA increased further, the
retarding ability of the FLCA is too strong and it could not be used as a fluid loss
control additive at all. Therefore, the dosage of IA is small than AA or MA.
6. More information about fluid loss evaluation method should be added in this
paper. The authors need to explain their results in more detail.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s suggestion. More information have been added
accordingly.
7. Remove “The effect of the type and content of carboxylic acid group on the
retarding side effect of FLCA and the compatibility between FLCA and the retarder
AMPS-IA synthesized by AMPS and IA was studied in this paper. Several conclusions
could be obtained by the study in this paper.” in conclusion.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s suggestion. This sentence have been removed
accordingly.

Response: Thanks for the referee’s suggestion. The figure have been improved
accordingly.
(3)The written English language of the manuscript must be professionally proofread

Response: Thanks for the referee’s suggestion. The language have been improved
accordingly.
(4) The method for cement slurry preparation should be described more in detail.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s suggestion. More detailed method have been
added accordingly.
(5) I am confused why the API static fluid loss is as twice much as the collected
filtrate volume.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s suggestion. Because the area of the filter screen
used in high temperature high pressure filter press is half of the normal
temperature filter press.
(6) Present the methodology adding more details as the vicat apparatus etc.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s suggestion. More detailed method have been
added accordingly.
(7) The method for intrinsic viscosity number should be described more in detail.
Response: Thanks for the referee’s suggestion. More detailed method have been
added accordingly.
