In this manuscript, a visible-light-responsive g-C3N4-Bi2WO6 nano-composites heterojunction
has been synthesized. Its photocatalytic activity was studied by degradation of MO. Some
interesting results are obtained. I recommend it for publication in Royal Society Open Science
after finished following questions:
1. The authors should check the paper carefully, especial the punctuation, capital and small letter,
etc.
2. The authors should explain red shift upon the composites, or other support from literature.

The present MS investigated the composite of g-C3N4 nanosheets and Bi2WO6 nanoparticles as
photocatalyts for MO degradation under visible light irradiation. The structure and property
were studied. I would like to give some comments to improve this work.
1. How to criculate the samples should be stated.
2. Figure 8: The irradiation time is only two mins for each cycle, which is not consistent.
3. The authors should give a compresive comparison work to highlight their samples.

account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.

We have checked the paper carefully, including the punctuation, captical and small letter and
have corrected them. Thanks for the reviewing.
2. The authors should explain red shift upon the composites, or other support from literature.
Thanks for the suggestion, for the red shift upon the composites, it is attributed to the
interaction between g-C3N4 and Bi2WO6 in the composites. Other articles also have this
phenomenons, for examples: reference 31 and 32.

Comments to the Author(s)
The present MS investigated the composite of g-C3N4 nanosheets and Bi2WO6 nanoparticles as
photocatalyts for MO degradation under visible light irradiation. The structure and property were
studied. I would like to give some comments to improve this work.
1. How to circulate the samples should be stated.
After every cycle, the sample was centrifuged, washed and dried at 60<U+2103>.and then do as the first
time: 50 mg of the sample was dispersed in 50 mL of methyl orange solution (5 mg L-1) and stirred
for 120 min under dark conditions to achieve adsorption equilibrium. After the start of the
experiment, for a certain time period, about 3 mL suspensions were collected and centrifuged to
wipe off the photocatalytics. The concentrations of residued MO were then monitored by UV–Vis
spectrometer at wave length of 463 nm. We mentioned this at the photocatalytic tests section and
stability section in the article.
2. Figure 8: The irradiation time is only two mins for each cycle, which is not consistent.
For the Figure 8, The irradiation time is should two hours for each cycle, and we have corrected
it. Thanks for the reviewing.
3. The authors should give a compresive comparison work to highlight their samples.
Thanks for the advice. The highlight of our samples as following:
g-C3N4 nanosheet in several nanometers thickness were hybridized with Bi2WO6 nanoparticles
by a facile solvothermal method.
Optimum photocatalytic activity of the composite is almost 2.7 and 8.5 times higher than those
of individual g-C3N4 and Bi2WO6.
Radical trapping experiments reveal the·O2- should be the main active species in photocatalysis
The above highlight of our samples we mentioned at abstract and conclusion in the article.
