1. I cannot find in this manuscript how to define the factor k, and how to relate the k and damage
factor D. Please give an explanation.
2. The microparameters in PFC model are very important for the calculation to reveal the real
mechanism of the coaling process. Though the authors has used the uniaxial tests to determine
the parameters, however, I cannot find the proof such as the testing curves or test conditions.
3. 4.1 and 4.2 is the same title.
4. How to modeling the cutting depth in PFC 2D? Is the depth is firstly supposed as a value, and
then a drilling rate is given on the rock? It is not real for the drilling process. And from the Fig 2
and Fig.7, the drilling processes are different.
5. Check the figure 4, the curves are linear, it is not correct. And also, in Fig.5 and Fig.6, the
relationship of the k And D, D and E, why are the two parameters are equal?
6. The rock breakage is very complex because of rock properties, drilling process and
corresponding factors, we should find the breakage process based on the clear mechanical
parameters to reveal the breakage mechanism. The description in this manuscript gives no
details.

The authors investigate the effect of prior inherited damage by the rock on its resistance to
mechanical cutting with cutting picks usually met on the cutting heads of roadheaders. For this
3
investigation they rely on primitive concepts of damage mechanics and commercial numerical
software (PFC2d) to simulate the action of a single pick during rock cutting. Significant
improvement of the use of the english language is required before the possible publication of the
paper. Further comments are listed below:
<U+2981> In p. 1. The sentence "Two major working procedures are needed in mining: to excavate the
mining channel and the ore body mining, as shown in Fig. 1. .." is not correct both in mining
terms and with regards to its grammar or syntax .
<U+2981> In the Introduction and in the literature review the authors should mention the relevant paper
regarding simulation of rock cutting with PFC and other methods by M. Stavropoulou, Modeling
of small-diameter rotary drilling tests on marbles, International Journal of Rock Mechanics &
Mining Sciences 43 (2006) 1034–1051, also with regards to rock damage the paper: Exadaktylos G.
and Stavropoulou M., (2008) A Specific Upscaling Theory of Rock Mass Parameters Exhibiting
Spatial Variability: Analytical relations and computational scheme, International Journal of Rock
Mechanics and Mining Sciences, 45 (2008) pp. 1102–1125.
<U+2981> The damage influences the 7 parameters of the particle model of the rock that are involved in
the simulation, namely the two stiffneses, UCS, UTS, friction angle.
<U+2981> In p. 3 the authors describe the cutting process but they do not mention the attack angle and the
back rake angle..."7. The rock was cut by pickaxe cutter with an angle of 55 degrees, a cutting
speed of 1 m/s and a cutting distance of 120 mm. The cutting depth is 5mm, 10mm and 15mm....".
<U+2981> Since the author have found from the simulations that the rock breakage is mainly performed
through the creation of tensile cracks why did they have chose the Uniaxial Compression test
(UCT) for the calibration of damage and for forming the ratio of SE over the energy expended in
this test up to the point of failure instead of the uniaxial tensile test?
The paper is concerned with a topic of appreciable practical significance, namely that of pre-
conditioning the rock for subsequent action of a mechanical cutting pick that will result into more
efficient cutting processes. However, the paper needs significant improvement before its
publication.

This paper investigated the rock fragmentation induced by rock cutting via DEM with PBM.
Some comments are the following:
(1) The definition of parameter k was not clear, though it is a very crucial parameter in this paper.
(2) To my knowledge, the damage factor reflect the damage degree, i.e., the more the micro crack
or bond damage is, the larger the damage factor is. Therefore, the DEM samples with different
damage factors should be prepared according to their micro characteristics. However in this
paper, only the different of E and UCS are provided for samples with different damage factors,
whereas the description of the micro characteristic was not found.
(3) The macro parameters, e.g., the compressive and tensile strength, should be provided.
(4) The titles of sub-sections 4.1 and 4.2 were the same in the manuscript.
(5) The investigation of influence of rock cutting on fragmentation should be more detailed, and
more micro information, e.g. the force chain, the bond breakage, is expected to be provided. The

Revision response to Associate Editor
Response to the comments of associate editor of the paper entitled “
Investigation for the influence mechanism of rock damage on rock
fragmentation and cutting performance by the discrete element method”
Many thanks for constructive comments from the reviewers and the editor. These
comments and suggestions have been carefully considered in the current manuscript.
Those revised texts were labelled in red in the manuscript. Major changes are
summarized as below:
Remark #1: you must include evidence of having had your manuscript reviewed by a
language polishing service.
Action: Done.
Revision response to Reviewer #1
Response to the comments of Reviewer 1 of the paper entitled “
Investigation for the influence mechanism of rock damage on rock
fragmentation and cutting performance by the discrete element method”
Many thanks for constructive comments from the reviewers and the editor. These
comments and suggestions have been carefully considered in the current manuscript.
Those revised texts were labelled in red in the manuscript. Major changes are
summarized as below:
Remark #1: I cannot find in this manuscript how to define the factor k, and how to
relate the k and damage factor D. Please give an explanation.
Action: Done. Thanks for comments. Factor k, a newly introduced variable, is a scale
factor used to adjust the microscopic parameters in the PFC model and can be called a
microscopic variable. D, the damage variable in the mechanical parameters, is a
macroscopic variable. Before the uniaxial compression experiment, there is no
quantitative relationship between k and D. It was found through experimental
determination and calculation that k and D were equal. Therefore, k and D are variables
in different scales, but their values are equal.
Remark #2: The micro-parameters in PFC model are very important for the calculation
to reveal the real mechanism of the coaling process. Though the authors has used the
uniaxial tests to determine the parameters, however, I cannot find the proof such as the
testing curves or test conditions.
Action: Done. The results of uniaxial compression test are added, as shown in Figure
4, and details of the PFC model calibration are also shown in the figure.
Remark #3: 4.1 and 4.2 is the same title.
Action: Done. We are sorry for the misunderstanding caused by writing.
Remark #4: How to modeling the cutting depth in PFC 2D? Is the depth is firstly
supposed as a value, and then a drilling rate is given on the rock? It is not real for the
drilling process. And from the Fig 2 and Fig.7, the drilling processes are different.
Action: Done. In this paper, the depth is pre-determined and the pick is placed in the
corresponding position. Then the pick is given a speed to cut the rock.
Regarding the relationship between Figures 2 and 7, we studied a single pick from
multiple picks. Generally, the cutting pathway of a single pick can be simplified as a
straight line, because a cutting unit of the arc pathway could be deemed as a line in
experimental scale modeling.
Remark #5: Check the figure 4, the curves are linear, it is not correct. And also, in
Fig.5 and Fig.6, the relationship of the k And D, D and E, why are the two parameters
are equal?
Action: Done. Generally, PFC simulation starts from the elastic stage of rock, because
PFC model cannot simulate the non-linear deformation of rock caused by the
compression and closure of internal cracks.
The factor k is a microscopic parameter and D is a macroscopic parameter. There is
neither any quantitative relationship between microscopic parameters and macroscopic
parameters in PFC nor any relevant report. The equivalence of k and D is acquired from
the experimental results.
Figure 6 shows the relationship between the energy density and the rock damage factor
D.
Remark #6: The rock breakage is very complex because of rock properties, drilling
process and corresponding factors, we should find the breakage process based on the
clear mechanical parameters to reveal the breakage mechanism. The description in this
manuscript gives no details.
Action: Done. According to your suggestion, this paper presents the process of rock
fragmentation by analyzing the force chain network and crack propagation near the pick.
In addition, the influence of damage factor on cutting force is analyzed. Please check
Section 4.1.
Revision response to Reviewer #2
Response to the comments of reviewer 2 of the paper titled “
Investigation for the influence mechanism of rock damage on rock
fragmentation and cutting performance by the discrete element method”
Many thanks for constructive comments from the reviewers and the editor. These
comments and suggestions have been carefully considered in the current manuscript.
The revised texts were marked in red in the manuscript. Major changes are summarized
as below:
Remark #1: In p. 1. The sentence "Two major working procedures are needed in
mining: to excavate the mining channel and the ore body mining, as shown in Fig. 1. .."
is not correct both in mining terms and with regards to its grammar or syntax .
Action: Done. Errors have been corrected after polishing the language.
Remark #2: In the Introduction and in the literature review the authors should mention
the relevant paper regarding simulation of rock cutting with PFC and other methods by
M. Stavropoulou, Modeling of small-diameter rotary drilling tests on marbles,
International Journal of Rock Mechanics & Mining Sciences 43 (2006) 1034–1051,
also with regards to rock damage the paper: Exadaktylos G. and Stavropoulou M.,
(2008) A Specific Upscaling Theory of Rock Mass Parameters Exhibiting Spatial
Variability: Analytical relations and computational scheme, International Journal of
Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences, 45 (2008) pp. 1102–1125.
Action: Done. We did not notice the paper “Modeling of Small-diameter Rotary
Drilling Tests on Marbles” at first because it is a paper on drilling instead of cutting.
However, after the reviewer’s reminder, we find that the content of PFC in this paper
is very valuable for reference, and it is quoted.
“A Specific Upscaling Theory of Rock Mass Parameters Exhibiting Spatial
Variability: Analytical Relations and Computational Scheme” is a paper of high quality
which has a reference value for the method of damage factor calculation in the
manuscript, so it is cited.
Remark #3: The damage influences the 7 parameters of the particle model of the rock
that are involved in the simulation, namely the two stiffneses, UCS, UTS, friction angle.
Action: Done. There are 7 parameters in PFC5.0. They are the elastic modulus of linear
contact, the stiffness ratio of linear contact, the elastic modulus of parallel bond, the
stiffness ratio of parallel bond, the tensile strength of parallel bond, the shear strength
of parallel bond and the friction angle. However, the previous version only has 5
parameters, namely the two stiffneses, the UCS, the UTS and the friction angle.
Remark #4: In p. 3 the authors describe the cutting process but they do not mention
the attack angle and the back rake angle..."7. The rock was cut by pickaxe cutter with
an angle of 55 degrees, a cutting speed of 1 m/s and a cutting distance of 120 mm. The
cutting depth is 5mm, 10mm and 15mm....".
Action: The attack angle and the back rake angle have been added. The rock was cut
by pickaxe cutter with an attack angle of 55 degrees, a back rake angle of 10 degrees, a
cutting speed of 1 m/s and a cutting distance of 120 mm.
Remark #5: Since the author have found from the simulations that the rock breakage
is mainly performed through the creation of tensile cracks why did they have chose the
Uniaxial Compression test (UCT) for the calibration of damage and for forming the
ratio of SE over the energy expended in this test up to the point of failure instead of the
uniaxial tensile test?
Action: Done. As shown in Figure 10 in the manuscript, it is true that tensile failure
occurs in micro-scale during rock cutting. This tensile stress is produced by the
squeezing action and is not a direct tensile action. The tensile failure is similar to the
compression-induced tensile failure in the uniaxial compression test. This is the reason
why the uniaxial compression experiment is used.
Remark #6: The paper is concerned with a topic of appreciable practical significance,
namely that of pre-conditioning the rock for subsequent action of a mechanical cutting
pick that will result into more efficient cutting processes. However, the paper needs
significant improvement before its publication.
Action: Done.
Revision response to Reviewer #3
Response to the comments of reviewer 3 of the paper titled “
Investigation for the influence mechanism of rock damage on rock
fragmentation and cutting performance by the discrete element method”
Many thanks for the constructive comments from the reviewers and the editor. These
comments and suggestions have been carefully considered in the current manuscript.
Those revised texts were marked in red in the manuscript. Major changes are
summarized as below:
Remark #1: The definition of parameter k was not clear, though it is a very crucial
parameter in this paper.
Action: Done. Thanks for comments. Factor k, a new variable introduced, is a scaling
factor used to adjust the microscopic parameters in the PFC model, and it has no
practical physical significance.
Remark #2: To my knowledge, the damage factor reflect the damage degree, i.e., the
more the micro crack or bond damage is, the larger the damage factor is. Therefore, the
DEM samples with different damage factors should be prepared according to their
micro characteristics. However in this paper, only the different of E and UCS are
provided for samples with different damage factors, whereas the description of the
micro characteristic was not found.
Action: Done. The microcosmic parameters reduced by the scale factor are shown in
Table 2.
Remark #3: The macro parameters, e.g., the compressive and tensile strength, should
be provided.
Action: Done. The uniaxial compressive strength is shown in Table 3 and the tensile
strength is shown in Fig. 8.
Remark #4: The titles of sub-sections 4.1 and 4.2 were the same in the manuscript.
Action: Done. We are sorry for the misunderstanding caused by editing.
Remark #5: The investigation of influence of rock cutting on fragmentation should be
more detailed, and more micro information, e.g. the force chain, the bond breakage, is
expected to be provided. The content in section 4 was too little.
Action: Done. We have analyzed the process of rock fragmentation by using the force
chain and the bond breakage in Section 4.1.
Remark #6: The English needs improvement.
Action: Done. The language of the manuscript has been polished.
Remark #7: “<U+3001>”should be revised as “,” at Line 48, first page.
Action: Done.
