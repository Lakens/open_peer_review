This is a really solid paper. It’s very well written, and was a pleasure to read (which isn’t always
true of descriptive muscle papers!).
The ‘raw data’ is good, and the authors’ interpretations are well within the bounds of what is
realistic. Those sections of the modelling protocol that are more speculative are clearly
highlighted by the authors, and the sensitivity analyses are well implemented.
This paper will be important for the field way beyond Echidna myology, and should be well-read
by palaeontologists and functional morphologists more broadly.
I only have very minor comments:
- For the first two paragraphs of the Background and the last section of the Discussion, it might be
useful to actually have a basic illustration of the forelimb of pelycosaurs and cynodonts alongside
that of the monotreme and a therian mammal.
- I really liked the section comparing known joint spacing to those predicted by the scaling
equation. Really useful.
- Page 3-4 re: cylinder fitting. Maybe a bit more detail required in terms of how the cylinders were
actually fitted. At what point to you decide when the cylinder is fitted ‘well’?
- Page 5 – could you clarify why you didn’t just dissect the same cadaver that you CT scanned?
Why rely on literature data for the myology? Presumably dissection wasn’t permissible on the
specimen.
- Page 6 lines 30-46 – More of a philosophical point I suppose. Do you have any feeling for which
of these MMA metrics we should actually be focusing on? Individual raw moment arms?
Summed moment arms? Normalised moment arms? In what situations are these different metrics
appropriate? Is there any underlying biological justification for which of these we should be
using?
- Page 8 line 42 “Six muscle groups” – shouldn’t this be 4? Unless I’m missing something
- Page 12 line 16 “Cineradography” – sp
- Page 12 lines 16-38. Again, nothing wrong with this section. I’m just interested in the authors
opinions re: how we go about improving this in the future? Obviously weird spines and bulky
subcutaneous soft tissues are also something we like to reconstruct for our fossil taxa. Do you
think we’ll ever find a systematic way of correcting for these things? Or are our 3D modelling
methods just going to have to become more and more detailed and convoluted?

The submitted manuscript presents a valuable and promising methodological approach to the
virtual reconstruction of functional parameters of shoulder movement in the short-beaked
echidna, a species for which in vivo data on locomotion and other activities are rare. The study
contributes with its findings to a better understanding of the evolutionary transformation of the
pectoral girdle and forelimb in the stem lineage of therian mammals. I appreciate this manuscript
because of its profound and informative discussion and the careful examination of the methods
used. I have only a few critical comments.
Citation of previous studies:
In some text parts, the citation of previous scientific work is restricted to current reviews (for
instance: Luo, 2015; Lai et al. 2018) regarding key insights into the morphology and evolution of
the mammalian shoulder gained in the 1970ies and 1980ies (page 2: first paragraph, page 14).
Here, the authors should be as careful as in the final section of the discussion and provide the
original sources. On page 14, an unnecessary reference (Lai et al. 2018) is given for therian muscle
topography which is content of textbooks for a long time.
Interpretation of muscle moment arms and major actions of muscles:
The discussion of the results is unfortunately limited to the motion of the un-loaded limb. I think,
the authors will agree that relevant selective pressures arose from situations when the limb must
work against external forces, for instance during digging and during locomotion. In these
situations, the functions of the muscles, which are likely their major functions, are reversed (as
demonstrated by a number of EMG-studies combined with kinematic analyses). The major action
of the m. triceps, for example, is to prevent the flexion of the elbow, and the m. biceps is
predominantly the anti-extensor of this joint. The supraspinatus muscle evolved in therian
mammals as anti-flexor of the glenohumeral joint and so on. I would suggest that muscle actions
in the loaded limb rather explain the muscle moment arms and the differences between species.
The discussion contains some notes about the stabilizing role of muscles, but this role is clearly
underestimated in the interpretation of the findings and should find more attention (revise Table
S1 accordingly).
Material and Methods:
The very detailed description of the process for determining the joint coordinate systems is
difficult to understand for readers who are not working with such software programs. My
suggestion is to move specific descriptions to the capture of Figure 1. Figure 1 could be amended
4
by schematic drawings of the joint locations, especially the position of the elbow joint rotation
centers and the joints between scapulocoracoid and clavicle-interclavicle are not fully clear. The
arrows indicating the rotational axes are not always easy to recognize and could be labelled with
the motion component (flexion-extension, abduction-adduction, long-axis rotation). Definitions of
the rotating directions (flexion? extension? adduction? …) should be added.
Minor issues:
Prepare figure captions and a heading for Table 1.
Please, check the alphabetic order of the reference list.

Dear Prof Padian and Dr. Srinivasan,
We thank you and both Reviewers for their feedback on our manuscript. We
appreciate the time they have taken and feel the manuscript is improved through
the inclusion of their edits and suggestions. Our detailed response to the reviewer
comments can be found below.
Reviewer 1 comments
For the first two paragraphs of the Background and the last section of the
Discussion, it might be useful to actually have a basic illustration of the forelimb of
pelycosaurs and cynodonts alongside that of the monotreme and a therian
mammal.
We have added a basic overview figure as requested, as the new Figure 1.
Subsequent figures have been re-numbered throughout the text.
Page 3-4 re: cylinder fitting. Maybe a bit more detail required in terms of how the
cylinders were actually fitted. At what point to you decide when the cylinder is
fitted ‘well’?
We have added a sentence clarifying this process to page 3:
“The size, shape and position of the primitives were manipulated within 3ds
Max until the primitive surface matched as closely as possible the bone
contours of the joint surface, as judged by eye.”
We have also added to Figure 1 (now the revised Fig. 2) with clearer
schematic illustrations of the joints plus primitives.
Page 5 – could you clarify why you didn’t just dissect the same cadaver that you CT
scanned? Why rely on literature data for the myology? Presumably dissection
wasn’t permissible on the specimen.
Indeed, this specimen was not available for dissection at the time of model
building. Since writing the current manuscript, the specimen has been
formalin fixed and is in the process of being contrast-stained so we can
further document detailed muscle geometry (including architecture) and its
implications for our model. We have added a sentence on page 5 to clarify
this.
“The echidna specimen was kept intact for a future study and thus not
available for dissection at the time of model-building.”
Page 6 lines 30-46 – More of a philosophical point I suppose. Do you have any
feeling for which of these MMA metrics we should actually be focusing on?
Individual raw moment arms? Summed moment arms? Normalised moment
arms? In what situations are these different metrics appropriate? Is there any
underlying biological justification for which of these we should be using?
It is not currently clear which have biological significance, or how we should
apply each of these metrics: as some previous studies have discussed (e.g.
Brassey et al. 2017, Hutchinson et al. 2015) the relationship to behaviors we
might be interested in (e.g. posture) is not straight forward. Studies like
ours, which estimate muscle moment arm, are one half of the story. Once
these are documented, further studies of extant animals, particularly those
with detailed in-vivo kinetic/kinematic data, would contribute to uncovering
the nature of the relationships between muscle moment arms and
locomotor behavior/mechanics. We cannot claim to know which is ‘best’
with the data available to us in this study, hence why we have calculated
and presented several options used previously by other authors. We have
added a sentence to page 6 to draw attention to this interesting
philosophical point., directing the reader to the Discussion where the
limitations of our current understanding are discussed and referenced.
“As explored further in the Discussion, it is not clear which of these MMA
metrics (individual MMAs, summed MMAs, or summed normalized MMAs)
are most useful – further testing of extant animal models with in vivo data is
required – hence we have calculated and presented each metric in this
study.”
Page 8 line 42 “Six muscle groups” – shouldn’t this be 4? Unless I’m missing
something
Apologies – m. subcoracoideus and m. supracoracoideus were missing from
the first paragraph here. They are described in the following paragraphs,
and an erroneous repetition of m. supracoracoideus has also been
corrected.
Page 12 line 16 “Cineradography” – sp
The spelling error has been corrected.
Page 12 lines 16-38. Again, nothing wrong with this section. I’m just interested in
the authors opinions re: how we go about improving this in the future? Obviously
weird spines and bulky subcutaneous soft tissues are also something we like to
reconstruct for our fossil taxa. Do you think we’ll ever find a systematic way of
correcting for these things? Or are our 3D modelling methods just going to have to
become more and more detailed and convoluted?
Without detailed knowledge of these soft tissues, we may not be able to
correct for things like fat deposits or cutaneous/subcutaneous structures.
However, knowledge of how much certain tissues contribute to limiting
mobility across a variety of extant species, particularly those bracketing
extinct animals, can guide us in estimating the ‘true’ range of motion below
the hard limits estimated by bone-only models. Such knowledge is already
being collected and applied in other areas (e.g. extant archosaur data on
cartilage cap thickness to guide estimates of joint spacing). In the near-
future, we hope to measure ex-vivo mobility of echidna specimens and
compare how the bulky muscle volumes and peri-articular structures limit
joint mobility compared with our model estimates.

Citation of previous studies: In some text parts, the citation of previous scientific
work is restricted to current reviews (for instance: Luo, 2015; Lai et al. 2018)
regarding key insights into the morphology and evolution of the mammalian
shoulder gained in the 1970ies and 1980ies (page 2: first paragraph, page 14).
Here, the authors should be as careful as in the final section of the discussion and
provide the original sources. On page 14, an unnecessary reference (Lai et al.
2018) is given for therian muscle topography which is content of textbooks for a
long time.
More care has been taken to include the original sources for observations in
the sections mentioned. The unnecessary reference (Lai et al., 2018) is
removed from descriptions of therian muscle topography on page 14.
Interpretation of muscle moment arms and major actions of muscles: The
discussion of the results is unfortunately limited to the motion of the un-loaded
limb. I think, the authors will agree that relevant selective pressures arose from
situations when the limb must work against external forces, for instance during
digging and during locomotion. In these situations, the functions of the muscles,
which are likely their major functions, are reversed (as demonstrated by a number
of EMG-studies combined with kinematic analyses). The major action of the m.
triceps, for example, is to prevent the flexion of the elbow, and the m. biceps is
predominantly the anti-extensor of this joint. The supraspinatus muscle evolved in
therian mammals as anti-flexor of the glenohumeral joint and so on. I would
suggest that muscle actions in the loaded limb rather explain the muscle moment
arms and the differences between species. The discussion contains some notes
about the stabilizing role of muscles, but this role is clearly underestimated in the
interpretation of the findings and should find more attention (revise Table S1
accordingly).
We agree that in many scenarios the muscle will be acting against a load,
and have added clarification to the text that equally valid interpretations of
each muscle action could be as resistors of the opposite action or stabilisers.
However, EMG studies combined with kinematics in monotremes are
required to clarify muscle actions in the loaded limb and distinguish
between, for example, an elbow flexor vs an anti-extensor. Without EMG
data for the short-beaked echidna, we feel it is more transparent to report
actions of the muscle in an unloaded limb rather than a loaded one, which
requires inferences or assumption about the loads experienced during
different behaviours. We have added to the Materials and Methods,
Discussion and Table S1 caption to clarify that the muscle actions and
moment arms are described in the unloaded limb.
Page 6: “Muscle actions and moment arms are described in terms of an
unloaded limb. For example, m. triceps is described as an elbow extensor,
though its role in locomotion is likely to be in resisting elbow flexion exerted
by the ground reaction force.”
Page 14: “As mentioned previously, we must note that muscle actions are
described here in terms of the unloaded limb, but when working against
external loads, activation of a muscle may co-occur with other limb
movements. For example, we describe m. triceps as an elbow extensor and
interpret it to produce elbow extension when active in the unloaded limb,
but it may also be active during elbow flexion in order to counterbalance
ground reaction forces or other loads. Combined EMG and kinematic studies
in the echidna would clarify the exact functions of muscles in different
behaviors.”
Table S1: “Muscle actions were inferred from muscle moment arm
magnitudes and signs, and are described in terms of the unloaded limb.”
Material and Methods: The very detailed description of the process for
determining the joint coordinate systems is difficult to understand for readers
who are not working with such software programs. My suggestion is to move
specific descriptions to the capture [caption?] of Figure 1. Figure 1 could be
amended by schematic drawings of the joint locations, especially the position of
the elbow joint rotation centers and the joints between scapulocoracoid and
clavicle-interclavicle are not fully clear. The arrows indicating the rotational axes
are not always easy to recognize and could be labelled with the motion
component (flexion-extension, abduction-adduction, long-axis rotation).
Definitions of the rotating directions (flexion? extension? adduction? …) should be
added.
We agree that the joints are not so easy to distinguish in Figure 1 (note that
this is now Figure 2 in the revised manuscript, as an additional figure was
added). We have modified this figure to detail the reference pose separately
from the individual joints, and display the latter in separate panels with
their axes and the primitives used to define the joint centers. A separate
panel has also been added to revised Fig. 2 showing the color-coding of the
axes and the directions of positive rotations. However, we have not added
an annotation of motion component (flexion-extension etc) as we felt these
added clutter to the figure panels, and are shown in subsequent figures.
Prepare figure captions and a heading for Table 1.
Our apologies – this table did have a heading and caption but appears to
have been misplaced during upload! This has been added.
Please, check the alphabetic order of the reference list.
We have moved Lai et al., 2018 to be in the correct place alphabetically.
