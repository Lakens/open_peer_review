The manuscript titled: “Research on preparation of phosphates modified animal glue binder for
use in foundry” is interesting and scientifically relevant, but needs major improvement.
Manuscript is not well written incomplete description of materials and methodology, unqualified
edition, failure to comply with the requirements of the journal, poor bibliography.
Major revisions need to be done before reconsidering publication. In its current state, I can not
accept this manuscript.
Please pay special attention to following points:
- give all titles of axis according to the standards of Journal RSOS.
- give all dimensions according to the standard style of the Journal RSOS.
- all figures and table headlines should be revised according to the requirements of Journal RSOS.
- may you consider citing of up-to-date relevant more literature with special attetion to papers in
the latest five years.
- detailed checking of the text would be recommended to correct editorial and grammatical
mistakes before its publication.

Abstract
line 18: Change “ DTGA” to “DTG”.
line 26: Insert „oC”.
Introduction
In the introduction (Investigations) part, the given literature information is very limited.
The introduction section must be rewritten, in particular emphasizing why this study is
important. At the last paragraph of the Introduction section, originality of this work should have
been presented with comparing the researches done previously.
The goal of this paper is not clear to the reader.
Page 2, Line 11: Change to “Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)”.
Page2, Line 12: Change to “Derivative Thermogravimetric Analysis (DTG)”.
Experimental procedures
- There is no information about the physicochemical properties materials, explain chemistry
„animal glue”.
- There is no clear information about the methods preparation mixing processes with
hydrochloric acid and citric acid.
- Equipment
There is no all info about the type aparatures and measurements Tensile strength, Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (column, gel,
eluent, pomp, detector) and Derivative Thermogravimetric Analysis (DTG) (atmosphere, gas
flow rate, temperature increase rate). What kind of viscosity?

- The results and discussion of the study are not clear to the reader. The authors should discuss in

detail of results and theory.
- Please check out nomenclature.

Page 1, line 15. The phosphates were used as modifiers, but not as a catalyst.
Page 2, paragraph 2.2. There is not enough information about the procedure of making sand
test specimens, including, for example, about tooling, 24- hour storage conditions. How many
sand specimens were tested? What is the shelf life of the proposed binder?

Page 2/line51, Page6/line 54, Page7/line 40. Why there is “compression” strength if the
specimens are only tensile tested?
Page 3, line 51. According to the Figure 2, instead of 3% should be 4%.
Page 5. There is no reference to Table 2
Page 6, line 52. Used here as the best composition 3:3:4:100 is different from the results presented
in Table 3 (the best strength was for composition 3:3:5:100). That should be explained because this
composition was mentioned in Abstracts (Page1/line 24) and in Conclusion (Page 10/line39)
Page 10, line 28. In this presentation there are results of testing only one property of the sand
cores – 24 hour tensile strength under unknown conditions. That is not enough to conclude that
this binder “can be used” for the sand core production.
Page 10, line 48. The conclusion about thermal degradation is not followed from the results
shown in comments to Fig.7 (Page 9/line 12).
It would be good to add the graph that would show a direct correlation between tensile strength
and binder viscosity.
The English language should be significantly improved (for example page/lines: 1/26,48.49;
2/23,24,46; 3/28-31; 4/19,20; 5/21,25; 10/41,45).

The manuscript titled: “Research on preparation of phosphates modified animal glue binder for
use in foundry” needs now minor improvement: 1. failure to comply with the requirements of
the journal (correct editorial), 2. still poor bibliography.
Please pay special attention to following points:
- may you consider citing of up-to-date relevant more literature with special attetion to papers in
the latest five years, e.g:

- detailed checking of the text would be recommended to correct editorial and grammatical
mistakes before its publication.

Dear Dr Tian-shu,
I am pleased to inform you that your manuscript entitled "Research on preparation of phosphates
modified animal glue binder for use in foundry" is now accepted for publication in Royal Society
Open Science.
You can expect to receive a proof of your article in the near future. Please contact the editorial
office (openscience_proofs@royalsociety.org and openscience@royalsociety.org) to let us know if
you are likely to be away from e-mail contact. Due to rapid publication and an extremely tight
schedule, if comments are not received, your paper may experience a delay in publication.
Royal Society Open Science operates under a continuous publication model
(http://bit.ly/cpFAQ). Your article will be published straight into the next open issue and this

Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our manuscript
entitled “Research on preparation of phosphates modified animal glue binder for use
in foundry” (No. RSOS-171795). Those comments are all valuable and very helpful
for revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding significance to
our researches. We have studied comments carefully and have made correction which
we hope meet with approval. Revised portion are marked in red in the paper. The
main corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s comments are as
flowing:
1. The introduction part of this MS is limited and needs to be re-written.
Response: We are very sorry for our incorrect writing this paper, we have re-written it
according to the Reviewer’s suggestion
2. The experimental procedures part of this MS is poor and needs to be detailed
description.
Response: As Reviewer suggested that we have re-written it, and we added the test
information of FTIR, GPC and DTG.
3. Used here as the best composition 3:3:4:100 is different from the results presented
in Table 3 (the best strength was for composition 3:3:5:100). That should be explained
it.
Response: Because the sequence of modifiers effecting the tensile strength is sodium
tripolyphosphate, sodium pyrophosphate and sodium hexametaphosphate by
orthogonal test. Under T5 treatment (sodium pyrophosphate : sodium
tripolyphosphate : sodium hexametaphosphate : animal glue = 3:3:5:100), the highest
tensile strength than other treatments were observed. However, according to the
tensile strength average value (K) of each modifier, 3.0g sodium pyrophosphate, 3.0g
sodium tripolyphosphate and 4.0g sodium hexametaphosphate were selected to further
test, it compared to T5, showed better effects not only on tensile strength (3.20MPa)
but also on viscosity (880mPa·s).
Thus, the best ratio of the modifiers by weight was determined as sodium
pyrophosphate : sodium tripolyphosphate : sodium hexametaphosphate : animal glue
= 3:3:4:100.
4. It would be good to add the graph that would show a direct correlation between
tensile strength and binder viscosity.
Response: We are very sorry can not add it.The purpose of this paper was to research
the characteristics of the modified animal glue binder system by inorganic salt
modifiers, and the modified binder had proper viscosity and higher tensile strength.
Further, as seen from table 3, it shown that a no direct correlation between tensile
strength and binder viscosity.
We greatly appreciate both your help and that of the referees concerning improvement
to this paper. We hope that the revised manuscript is now suitable for publication.
Thank you and best regards.
