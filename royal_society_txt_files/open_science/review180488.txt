Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
I was a referee 1 when the previous version of the manuscript was submitted to JRSI. I find the
revised manuscript and the response to referees (in particular, those to my comments)
unsatisfactory.
My previous comment 2:
In the Results Section, the authors mention about the assumption of “non-overlapping paths”. I
wonder if this assumption still holds for empirical datasets. It is because the LZ entropy rate is
measured using “the shortest substring … that has not previously been encountered.” Hence, it is
important to see whether any substring has appeared previously or not. My question is how often
this repetition occurs in the empirical datasets, accordingly, how robust this assumption of “non-
overlapping paths” is when Eq. (16) is applied to the real world problems. In addition, Eq. (16) is
already using the empirical results of apparent velocity across the cell and the total dwell time
within the cell, which seem to already carry a considerable amount of information about the
mobility patterns. Therefore, Eq. (16) must be anyhow better than the results from the simpler
model in Ref. [8]. Thus it is not surprising at all to find that Eq. (16) fits better than the model in
Ref. [8] does. And again, how Eq. (16) could be modified if the assumption of non-overlapping
paths is relaxed? (I guess this is a difficult problem.)
Authors’ response:
The modification of the analysis to allow for overlapping paths is not trivial, and likely would be
a good PhD dissertation topic. However, the impact seems to be minimal indicating that either
overlapping paths have a limited impact on entropy rate of physical systems or that the impact
has the same structural form as Eq 16, and the effect is absorbed into the fit constants in the
summation.
My response to authors’ response:
Although I recognize the difficulty of the problem, the authors are suggested to explicitly
mention the possible issues in the main text. And/or some sentences in authors’ response can be
included in the main text: “However, the impact seems to be minimal indicating that either
overlapping paths have a limited impact on entropy rate of physical systems or that the impact
has the same structural form as Eq 16, and the effect is absorbed into the fit constants in the
summation.”
In addition, the authors are suggested to tone down about their claims of “excellent agreement”
as I pointed out in my above comment.

Decision letter (RSOS-180488.R0)
20-Jul-2018
Dear Dr Paul,
The editors assigned to your paper ("Multiscale Entropy Rate Analysis of Complex Mobile
Agents") have now received comments from reviewers. We would like you to revise your paper
in accordance with the referee and Associate Editor suggestions which can be found below (not
3
including confidential reports to the Editor). Please note this decision does not guarantee
eventual acceptance.
Please submit a copy of your revised paper before 12-Aug-2018. Please note that the revision
deadline will expire at 00.00am on this date. If we do not hear from you within this time then it
will be assumed that the paper has been withdrawn. In exceptional circumstances, extensions
may be possible if agreed with the Editorial Office in advance. We do not allow multiple rounds
of revision so we urge you to make every effort to fully address all of the comments at this stage.
If deemed necessary by the Editors, your manuscript will be sent back to one or more of the
original reviewers for assessment. If the original reviewers are not available, we may invite new
reviewers.
To revise your manuscript, log into http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision. Revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your
Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you must respond to the comments made by the
referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". Please use this to
document how you have responded to the comments, and the adjustments you have made. In
order to expedite the processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in
your response.
In addition to addressing all of the reviewers' and editor's comments please also ensure that your
revised manuscript contains the following sections as appropriate before the reference list:
• Ethics statement (if applicable)
If your study uses humans or animals please include details of the ethical approval received,
including the name of the committee that granted approval. For human studies please also detail
whether informed consent was obtained. For field studies on animals please include details of all
permissions, licences and/or approvals granted to carry out the fieldwork.
• Data accessibility
It is a condition of publication that all supporting data are made available either as
supplementary information or preferably in a suitable permanent repository. The data
accessibility section should state where the article's supporting data can be accessed. This section
should also include details, where possible of where to access other relevant research materials
such as statistical tools, protocols, software etc can be accessed. If the data have been deposited in
an external repository this section should list the database, accession number and link to the DOI
for all data from the article that have been made publicly available. Data sets that have been
deposited in an external repository and have a DOI should also be appropriately cited in the
manuscript and included in the reference list.
If you wish to submit your supporting data or code to Dryad (http://datadryad.org/), or modify
your current submission to dryad, please use the following link:

• Competing interests
Please declare any financial or non-financial competing interests, or state that you have no
competing interests.
• Authors’ contributions
All submissions, other than those with a single author, must include an Authors’ Contributions
section which individually lists the specific contribution of each author. The list of Authors
should meet all of the following criteria; 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, or
4
acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it
critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published.
All contributors who do not meet all of these criteria should be included in the
acknowledgements.
We suggest the following format:
AB carried out the molecular lab work, participated in data analysis, carried out sequence
alignments, participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript; CD carried out
the statistical analyses; EF collected field data; GH conceived of the study, designed the study,
coordinated the study and helped draft the manuscript. All authors gave final approval for
publication.
• Acknowledgements
Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship
criteria.
• Funding statement
Please list the source of funding for each author.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science charge article processing charges for all new
submissions that are accepted for publication. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to
Royal Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers
submitted as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry
(http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/chemistry). If your manuscript is newly submitted and
subsequently accepted for publication, you will be asked to pay the article processing charge,
unless you request a waiver and this is approved by Royal Society Publishing. You can find out
more about the charges at http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/page/charges. Should you
have any queries, please contact openscience@royalsociety.org.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-180488.R0)
Dear Editor,
Thank you for giving the opportunity to modify the submission.
As the reviewer suggested, we have:
1) included our previous response in the main text (please check the second last paragraph of the
Discussion section (section 4)).
2) rephrased the second paragraph of the Results section (Section 3), which now does not contain
the phrase the reviewer objected to (and some other changes).
Best regards,
Tuhin Paul
