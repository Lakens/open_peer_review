In this manuscript, the authors developed polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based porous carbon materials
by heating KOH at 800 oC for the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution. This article studied
adsorption properties and adsorption capacity of PAN-based porous carbon materials. This
research topic is quite interesting for broad reader, while the experimental design and manuscript
organization need to be further improved. Hence, the manuscript is not recommended for
publication in Royal Society Open Science. The following reasons are for authors’ reference only.
1. Language is far from the level required for publication in Royal Society Open Science. It is
strongly recommended the very carefully, profound linguistic (grammar) correction.
2. The adsorption capacity of PPC-0.8-800 is not so good. To absorb the initial concentration of
Cr(VI) (231.48 ppm), the residual concentration of Cr(VI) is 17.48 ppm, which is still higher than
the permissible limit of total chromium is set by WHO.
3. The recyclability for the removal of Cr(VI) is sustained reduced from 92.45% to 82%.
4. The adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) on PPC-0.8-800 should compare with other carbon materials.

In this paper, the authors prepared porous carbon from PAN fibers for the removal of Cr(VI).
Activated carbons have been fabricated from lots of precursors, so the author should state the
advantage of using PAN fibers as precursor.
Other comments:
1. Figure 6, vertical coordinates: qt should be qe.
2. In section 3.2, the optimum pH value for the maximum removal capacity of chromium is 1.0.
3
The authors should give a good explanation.
3. In adsorption mechanism section, the electrostatic attraction between protonated amine groups
of PPC and HCrO4- ions is the adsorption mechanism. However, the PPC-0.8-800 has low
nitrogen content in comparison with PPC-0.6-600. Thus, the specific surface area and pore
structure should also be considered in the adsorption mechanism.

Appendix A
Replies to the Referees
According to the helpful and valuable comments, we revised our manuscript, the details information as
following:
Reviewer #1: In this manuscript, the authors developed polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based porous carbon
materials by heating KOH at 800 oC for the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution. This article studied
adsorption properties and adsorption capacity of PAN-based porous carbon materials. This research topic
is quite interesting for broad reader, while the experimental design and manuscript organization need to
be further improved. Hence, the manuscript is not recommended for publication in Royal Society Open
Science. The following reasons are for authors’ reference only.
1. Language is far from the level required for publication in Royal Society Open Science. It is strongly
recommended the very carefully, profound linguistic (grammar) correction.
Answer:Thank you very much for your kind suggestion. We have improved the grammar and spelling
errors of the manuscript. In addition, we have asked several colleagues who are skilled authors of
English language paper to check the English. We believe that the language is now acceptable for the
review process.
2. The adsorption capacity of PPC-0.8-800 is not so good. To absorb the initial concentration of Cr(VI)
(231.48 ppm), the residual concentration of Cr(VI) is 17.48 ppm, which is still higher than the
permissible limit of total chromium is set by WHO.
Answer:Thanks for the suggestion. The question is critical and meaningful. In this paper, in order to
ensure the unity of the experimental data, 50 mg of samples were used throughout the experiment. The
adsorption capacity of sample will be improved by increasing the initial mass of sample, which is suitbale
for decreasing the residual concentration of Cr(VI) to satisfy the permissible limit of total chromium is
set by WHO.
3. The recyclability for the removal of Cr(VI) is sustained reduced from 92.45% to 82%.
Answer:Thanks for the suggestion. I have to admit that the recyclability for the removal of Cr(VI) is not
so good. But the adsorption capacity of my materals are better than many other materials that metioned
in literature. On the other hand ,we will still continue to explore the methods to improve the recyclability
in our subsquent research in the future.
4. The adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) on PPC-0.8-800 should compare with other carbon materials.
Answer:Thanks for the suggestion. This is a good idea, in order to clarify the high performance of PPC-
0.8-800, we add the Table 4 and section 3.7 in the paper to compare with other carbon materials which
has been highlighted.
Reviewer #2: In this paper, the authors prepared porous carbon from PAN fibers for the removal of
Cr(VI). Activated carbons have been fabricated from lots of precursors, so the author should state the
advantage of using PAN fibers as precursor.
Answer:Thanks for the suggestion.The reasons of using PAN fibers as precursor have been mentioned
in the Introduction (Highlights of “Moreover, PAN has favourable chemical resistance, thermal stability,
low flammability and good mechanical properties”)
1. Figure 6, vertical coordinates: qt should be qe.
Answer: Thank you for your reminder. It is our mistake, the “qt” were corrected as “qe” in Figure 6.
2. In section 3.2, the optimum pH value for the maximum removal capacity of chromium is 1.0. The
authors should give a good explanation.
Answer: The adsorption of metal ions by adsorbents depended on solution pH, which is because pH
influenced the adsorbent surface charge.When the pH value is low, adsorbent static charges was
presented in positively charged form. However, more and more negative charge formed on the surface
of the adsorbent with the increasing of pH. Therefore, the optimum sorption, that was to say pH was
1.0, the dominant species of Cr ion in solution was HCrO4¬- . Considering the pH value of industrial
wastewater and domestic wastewater is generally about 2 , therefore pH value of the optimum sorption
was 2.0 though the optimum pH value for the maximum removal capacity of chromium is 1.0.
3. In adsorption mechanism section, the electrostatic attraction between protonated amine groups of
PPC and HCrO4- ions is the adsorption mechanism. However, the PPC-0.8-800 has low nitrogen content
in comparison with PPC-0.6-600. Thus, the specific surface area and pore structure should also be
considered in the adsorption mechanism.
Answer: Thanks a lot for the suggestion. The pecific surface area and pore structure are the important
factors which impact the adorsoption capacity of Cr of the materials. Therefore, we gave a sufficient
explanation to demonstrate the effects of the pecific surface area and pore structure, which has been
highlighted in section 3.8
