Thompson et al examine the abundance of larval rockfishes in waters within and outside of
several very large marine protected areas in southern California. They use CalCOFI samples and
genetics to identify individuals to species. They control for environmental variables yet show
that larval abundance has increased substantially more rapidly inside of reserves than outside of
reserves. They conclude that given larval life history and circulation patterns, the cowcod
conservation areas likely augment local fisheries. The study is well done and the manuscript well
written. I have a few questions, which the authors should easily be able to answer. Mostly they
are just interesting bits. I think the MS will be influential and of great interest to readers
especially since it is a strong demonstration that MPAs can help fisheries if done at large enough
scale. I strongly recommend the manuscript for publication.
The smooth increases in larval abundance seem at odds with fisheries ideas about strong year
classes determining abundance. What might explain the form of the observed increases? For
example, the authors note the strong 1999 year class. This might lead to a quick bump in
production once these individuals become reproductive, but we don’t see that. Answering this
isn't really essential to publishing the MS, but just something I found curious.
How does total reproduction from the CCAs compare to the rest of SoCal? Could the authors at
least do some back of the envelope calculations? I believe the NZ study compared female
biomass inside and out and found that MPA females would make substantial reproductive
contributions to the overall snapper population. It is hard to read the axes on Figure 5 with the
weird line pagination. The CCAs are a reasonably large percentage of the suitable habitat for
cowcod in SoCal. Does the reproductive output from these areas make up 50% of all cowcod
larvae etc? 3%? Even a fairly simple calculation based on mean larval abundance x area of
suitable habitat would be very interesting to see. Related to the above, given juvenile natural
mortality, how much would this CCA reproduction augment the area fisheries? Again a quick
calculation here would be interesting and adequate if the authors acknowledged that more
detailed work should be done on these topics.
Title: I’d add “Larval” before production, or “Larval abundance” instead of production. The MS
doesn’t really show that production of rockfishes increases. They do not look at changes in
population size, per se, just larval output - which is, of course, important.
Minor Stuff
Line 26. I’d note, as an aside, that if you are managing to 40% of unfished biomass, a 2/3rds
reduction is pretty close to what you might expect (33%). It does represent a big decline in
biomass from an ecological standpoint, but from a fisheries point of view, it is more or less
expected if not close to intentional.
Line 98. I know that the formalin samples cannot be used for genetics, but it might be worth
noting that this is why the authors only use the ethanol samples.
Line 118. Did these eliminated samples show any systematic spatial distribution that migh bias
the results in some form?

Line 140. Why just presence and absence? Why wouldn’t you test versus the absolute abundance
at a site?
Line 179. Why p < 0.1 instead of p < 0.05, the latter being the more typical significance threshold?
This shift would seem to be an extremely important point for the results of this study. By
lowering p to 0.1, did this allow the authors to fine more significant interactions among the
reserve group? Please justify.
Line 311. What does “fully recovered from overfishing” mean? Back to virgin biomass or just
40% of pre-exploitation biomass? Inside or outside of the reserve?
Line 324+. It might be worthwhile if the authors provided some info on the length of the pelagic
larval stage and general information on circulation patterns in the area. I mean a few sentences,
not some major analysis, which they have justified in the paragraph. I think it would be likely
that larvae would widely dispersed given the long (1-3 months) larval durations of most rockfish,
but readers less familiar with rockfish biology might benefit from a few more bits of information.
Table 2. The “.” Mark is a bit hard to see. I’d suggest a different symbol of some type.

This manuscript presents a study on the impact of large-scale marine protected areas (MPAs) that
were established to benefit populations of rockfishes within the Southern California Bight. While
there are many studies showing effects of MPAs across latitudes, ecosystems, and species, this
study is unique in that it addresses the potential of an MPA to increase the sustainability of fished
stocks via greater larval production over time. In addition, this sampling follows a true before-
after-control-impact-paired (BACIP) design, which is often lacking in studies of MPA ecology.
Adding the value of this paper, the authors explore the response of both targeted and non-
targeted species of rockfishes, which is uncommon in the MPA literature given the difficulty of
4
comparing similar species with different target status. This research is novel and timely,
especially considering the more recent establishment of additional MPAs along the California
coast and further northward, and their ongoing monitoring and evaluation. However, there are a
few key points to address before this paper could be accepted for publication, especially with
respect to the framing of these results in the broader context of the MPA literature and a few
aspects of the methods that need clarification.
In general this study is well-designed and well-analyzed and the results are compelling. The
authors targeted rockfishes in the early larval stage (< 5mm TL) to ensure those they considered
were likely spawned near the sampling area, they were accurately identified using primarily
genetics, and the paired approach clearly shows greater increases in the CCAs than outside.
These CCAs appear to be effective MPAs with respect to the goal of increasing rockfish
production. Where the discussion gets tricky is in the reference to these sites as “marine
reserves”. In the most widely accepted MPA nomenclature, marine reserves are sites where all
extractive or destructive activities are prohibited, i.e. “no-take” areas. The CCAs are focused on
rockfishes, hence the existing regulations that still permit fishing shoreward of 20 fathoms as well
as some fishing for flatfishes using specific gear types. This is an easy point to resolve—it does
not change the conclusions but requires a re-wording so that these are referred to as simply
MPAs (or more accurately, MPAs designed for rockfish conservation).
Some specific points:
-Lines 119-122: Here the authors discuss their standardization of larval count data by using a
standard haul factor, which is only briefly described. Please provide more specifics about how the
SHF was calculated and/or a reference. This is especially important when interpreting Table 1.
One helpful ref is the following, which gives an example of how SHF is calculated:
Lo, N. C. H., Y. a. G. Ruiz, M. J. Cervantes, H. G. Moser, and R. J. Lynn. 1996. Egg production and
spawning biomass of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) in 1994, determined by the daily egg
production method. California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations Reports 37:160–174.
-Lines 194-200: It’s interesting that cowcod were relatively rare in the larval samples (although
they showed significant increases nonetheless). As these were the target species for the CCA, I
was surprised that the authors didn’t return to this in the discussion. Submersible surveys are
showing greater adult densities; why might there be low numbers of larvae sampled? Does their
larval ecology play in here?
-Table 1: As mentioned above, without a clear description of how SHF was calculated, the larval
abundance vs. no. larvae is difficult to discern here.
-Table 2: Please use a different symbol than “.” for p < 0.10. In some places it looks like an errant
decimal.
-Figures 2, 3, & 5: Since the R2 and p values are in the appendices, it’s challenging to go back and
forth to evaluate the strength of these relationships. It would be better to have the R2 and p
values directly on each graph. For Figure 5 specifically, the legend states these are best-fit linear
regressions for the species with a significant interaction between year and CCA—I’d like to see
the actual R2 values that correlate to those figures. On the figure is great, but at the least
somehow in connection with Table S4.
Overall this is a strong paper—I look forward to seeing it published.

he following, we present reviewer comments in bold font and our response in normal font.

e smooth increases in larval abundance seem at odds with fisheries ideas about strong
r classes determining abundance. What might explain the form of the observed
reases? For example, the authors note the strong 1999 year class. This might lead to a
ck bump in production once these individuals become reproductive, but we don’t see
t. Answering this isn't really essential to publishing the MS, but just something I found
ious.
r response: Larval output doesn’t necessarily correlate with recruitment. We think of larvae
re of an index of female spawning stock biomass. The smooth increase likely depicts an
rease in female spawning biomass, which is a function of female numbers, female age and the
ironment.
viewer 1, comment 2
w does total reproduction from the CCAs compare to the rest of SoCal? Could the
hors at least do some back of the envelope calculations? I believe the NZ study
pared female biomass inside and out and found that MPA females would make
stantial reproductive contributions to the overall snapper population. It is hard to read
axes on Figure 5 with the weird line pagination. The CCAs are a reasonably large
centage of the suitable habitat for cowcod in SoCal. Does the reproductive output from

. Related to the above, given juvenile natural mortality, how much would this CCA
roduction augment the area fisheries? Again a quick calculation here would be
eresting and adequate if the authors acknowledged that more detailed work should be
e on these topics.
r response: This is an important point, but, we believe, a bit beyond the scope of this paper.
are actually working on a follow-up paper that will address this issue in more detail. We are
nning to use space-state models to conduct a more spatially-explicit analysis of larval rockfish

le: I’d add “Larval” before production, or “Larval abundance” instead of
duction. The MS doesn’t really show that production of rockfishes increases. They do
look at changes in population size, per se, just larval output - which is, of course,
portant.
r response: This is a good idea. We changed the title accordingly

point is that overfishing is a big problem, and this has been well documented. We got rid of
“2/3rds” and state that “biomass is estimated to have declined substantially”
viewer 1, comment 5
e 98. I know that the formalin samples cannot be used for genetics, but it might be
rth noting that this is why the authors only use the ethanol samples.
r response: We added “(formalin degrades while ethanol preserves DNA; contents of the
board net continued to be placed in formalin)” to the text.
viewer 1, comment 6
e 118. Did these eliminated samples show any systematic spatial distribution that migh
s the results in some form?
r response: No, the samples were seemingly randomly distributed. We added this sentence to
text: “These eliminated stations were randomly distributed and thus likely did not induce any
tematic bias to the analyses”.
viewer 1, comment 7
e 140. Why just presence and absence? Why wouldn’t you test versus the absolute
ndance at a site?
r response: We evaluated several models to analyze this data. Because the data were severely
o-inflated, we initially used a two-stage (hurdle) model that analyzed first presence/absence
second non zero abundances. We found that the non-zero component added almost no
itional explanatory power and hence settled on just the logistic model. We now explain this
he text: “(we initially used two-stage models that evaluated environmental effects separately
presence/absence and abundances of non-zero stations but found that the abundance
ponent did not improve model performance)”
viewer 1, comment 8
e 179. Why p < 0.1 instead of p < 0.05, the latter being the more typical significance
eshold? This shift would seem to be an extremely important point for the results of this
dy. By lowering p to 0.1, did this allow the authors to fine more significant interactions
ong the reserve group? Please justify.
r response: In recent years there have been many statisticians that have argued that setting on
0.5 as a cutoff for significance is arbitrary. We present the complete ANCOVA summary
e in Table S4 so the reader can see the p-values.
viewer 1, comment 9
e 311. What does “fully recovered from overfishing” mean? Back to virgin biomass or
t 40% of pre-exploitation biomass? Inside or outside of the reserve?
r response: We modified the text to better explain this point: “it seems that targeted
kfishes populations have not returned to pre-exploitation levels even within the CCAs”
viewer 1, comment 10
e 324+. It might be worthwhile if the authors provided some info on the length of the
agic larval stage and general information on circulation patterns in the area. I mean a
sentences, not some major analysis, which they have justified in the paragraph. I think
ould be likely that larvae would widely dispersed given the long (1-3 months) larval
ations of most rockfish, but readers less familiar with rockfish biology might benefit
m a few more bits of information.
r response. We added two sentences to this paragraph to address this point: “Depending on
species, rockfishes spend 1-2 months as pelagic larvae and then up to a year as pelagic
eniles [19]. As such, they have the potential to disperse beyond MPA boundaries.”

ble 2. The “.” Mark is a bit hard to see. I’d suggest a different symbol of some type.
r response: We fixed this by changing the “.” to an “*”

ere the discussion gets tricky is in the reference to these sites as “marine reserves”. In
most widely accepted MPA nomenclature, marine reserves are sites where all extractive
destructive activities are prohibited, i.e. “no-take” areas. The CCAs are focused on
kfishes, hence the existing regulations that still permit fishing shoreward of 20 fathoms
well as some fishing for flatfishes using specific gear types. This is an easy point to
olve—it does not change the conclusions but requires a re-wording so that these are
erred to as simply MPAs (or more accurately, MPAs designed for rockfish
servation).
r response: We went through the manuscript and changed “reserve” to MPA in most cases.
re were a couple of spots in the Discussion where “reserve” referred to a true no-take reserve,
we kept these.

nes 119-122: Here the authors discuss their standardization of larval count data by
ng a standard haul factor, which is only briefly described. Please provide more specifics
ut how the SHF was calculated and/or a reference. This is especially important when
erpreting Table 1. One helpful ref is the following, which gives an example of how SHF
alculated:
N. C. H., Y. a. G. Ruiz, M. J. Cervantes, H. G. Moser, and R. J. Lynn. 1996. Egg
duction and spawning biomass of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) in 1994, determined
the daily egg production method. California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries
estigations Reports 37:160–174.
r response: We added some text to clarify how SHF was calculated: “which is calculated by
iding the volume of water filtered by the tow depth and expressed as larvae under 10m2 of
surface area to the depth of a tow”. We cited a different paper (Hewitt 1980) than the one
gested by the reviewer as it explicitly shows the formula for SHF while Lo et al. does not.

nes 194-200: It’s interesting that cowcod were relatively rare in the larval samples
hough they showed significant increases nonetheless). As these were the target species
the CCA, I was surprised that the authors didn’t return to this in the discussion.
bmersible surveys are showing greater adult densities; why might there be low numbers
arvae sampled? Does their larval ecology play in here?
r response: I think that even though cowcod have increased, they are still rare relative to other
cies. The only recent submersible survey data that I’ve seen published is Stierhoff et al.
3. They found that cowcod comprised only .2% of the total rockfish abundance around
acapa Island. Their rank order species abundances were similar to ours in Table 1

ble 1: As mentioned above, without a clear description of how SHF was calculated, the
val abundance vs. no. larvae is difficult to discern here.
r response: We amended the Table caption to explain how SHF is used.

ble 2: Please use a different symbol than “.” for p < 0.10. In some places it looks like an
ant decimal.
r response: Reviewer 1 also mentioned this, and we fixed it.

gures 2, 3, & 5: Since the R2 and p values are in the appendices, it’s challenging to go
k and forth to evaluate the strength of these relationships. It would be better to have the
and p values directly on each graph. For Figure 5 specifically, the legend states these
best-fit linear regressions for the species with a significant interaction between year and
A—I’d like to see the actual R2 values that correlate to those figures. On the figure is
at, but at the least somehow in connection with Table S4.
r response: We’d be happy to add this to the figure but are not sure about how the journal
dles this (some journals don’t like statistics on figures). We defer to the journal publisher to
de us on where to place the statistical results.
