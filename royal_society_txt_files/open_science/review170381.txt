The manuscript reports the modelling and simulation of a thermally induced optical
transparency from based on SOI dual microring resonator. There are some comments below,
which should be clarified.
1. The authos should clarify the advantage of the dual ring configuration
2. Compared to the simulation of the transmission spectra, the authors have spent too much of
the content in the simulation of the refractive index.
3. How the coupling and absorption coefficeints influnece the through spectra?
4. The authos should dicuss the simulation results the application of this optical transparency in

In this paper, the author presents the modelling study on the thermally induced optical
transparency composed by two concentric rings. However, in my opinion, this manuscript is not
properly organized as a research paper.
1) The author draws 23 figures in this paper. However, in the main text, the discussion and
physical explanation are particularly rare.
2) Most of the figures are not professionally designed. For example, they are directly taken from
the Comsol or Matlab without careful design.
3) The Introduction is not well written. Moreover, the Conclusion is extremely long. I am afraid
the conclusion is almost longer than the discussion in the main text.
Indeed, the author might have done something interesting; however, the whole paper is not
organized satisfactorily. I strongly suggest the author to reconsider the structure of this paper and

focus on the specific points which are really new and instructive to the readers, instead of solely
listing a large number of figures without sufficient discussions.

The paper investigates the modelling and simulation of a dual-ring resonator coupled to a
waveguide, and the thermally induced optical transparency effect. The appearance of the optical
transparency dips away from the original spectral (resonance) dips is interesting, and could
provide useful applications, as many concepts like this (as shown in the CRIT case) will result in a
modification of the original response.
As it stands, I feel the paper needs improvement.
1) Suggestion to change the title to include the dual-ring setup. I suggest "Modelling and
Simulation of Thermally-Induced Optical Transparency in a Dual-Microring Resonator"
2) At times the paper reads very "colloquially" - that is, written in a less succinct way than typical
papers, and has some unnecessary repetition. Particularly the first paragraph of the introduction,
where sentences such as: "There have been many papers published...", "There is an excellent
review paper...", "A research group...". It makes more sense and is more fluid to instead talk about
the work itself (in the past tense) rather than the papers, and link to the reference unless
absolutely necessary.
3) Some grammatical errors, such as missing hyphens between words (e.g. "ring-to-ring", "dual-
ring", "high-contrast") and a lack of an expanded acronym for "SLD" is missing on page 10 and 16
(is SLD the same as SLED? SLED is explained, but not SLD). Also, a reference for the so-called
"rib fabrication process" is warranted as this is a term unheard of to me (possible link to the
author's PhD thesis or corresponding references).
4) Figure 1 on page 3 should have some dimensions or at least a scale bar. Information in the
preceding paragraph includes this information, but it is still unclear on some things - one thing in
particular is the mention of a 900nm ring to ring distance, is this the distance between the centre
of one dual-ring resonator (1) to the centre of the other dual-ring resonator (2)? Or the distance
between the outer-rings of each dual-ring resonators?
5) On page 7, how does the linear and thermo-optic expansion (from equation 3.1) relate to
equation 3.2?
6) On page 9, equation 3.3 has K_total etc. These K's, including K1, K2 etc are unexplained, not
sure what they physically 'are'. The transmission for each ring section?
7) On page 9, there is a missing open bracket (the last paragraph ends with a closed bracket only).
8) Page 17, line 5 - says '9ma' instead of '9mA'. On the following page (page 18), figure 15 legend
has a spelling mistake for 'heater' (red curve).
9) I feel that the main triumph of this paper, the optical transparency, could be explained a bit
more. It seems the author has pushed this onto a review paper. A few sentences explaining the
physical occurrence (akin to destructive interference of waves due to phase?) of optical
transparency would be nice.
10) As a point of curiosity, for the proposed applications - would the transparency be necessary
for the gas-flow sensing, or simply a resonance wavelength shift? Worth a mention.

Appendix A
Responses to Reviewer 1.
Point 1.
The results and discussions (subsection 4.3) now discusses the advantages of using a dual ring
configuration in this novel design. A comparison is made between this novel application and a coupled
resonator induced transparency (CRIT) device. The advantages of this new design are also
summarized in the conclusions section.
Point 2
I have removed intermediate refractive index data and figures and kept only the refractive index
figures that are relevant to an optical transparency that is realized by the application of a simulated
7mA heater currents.
Point 3
Temperature dependent coupling and ring absorption coefficients are now given in table 1. The
temperature dependent coupling and absorption coefficients affecting the through spectra are now
discussed in the Results and Discussions section.
Point 4
The paper has been completely restructured and so the simulation results are discussed in greater
detail in the Results and Discussion section. First the sensor operation is discussed with respect to,
and in reference to, the included figures. The simulation results in reference to the figures are now
discussed in greater detail. This novel design is compared to the CRIT design and additional figures
and explanations are provided for the comparison. Advantages of using this design over the CRIT are
given. An added section provides an example of applying thermal feedback and the effect on the
output is given. In additional sections, two applications are suggested for this novel sensor and these
proposed applications are outlined and briefly discussed in these sections.
Responses to Reviewer 2.
Point 1
The number of figures have been reduced. The figures included now only supplement the necessary
text for a clearer understanding of the simulation results. There is a more in-depth discussion of the
figures in the Results and Discussions section and ensuing subsections.
Point 2
All figures have been re-formatted to make them more legible to the reader and more suitable for
publication. Figure 1 has been redrawn as a 3D figure to enable the reader to gain a greater
understanding of the geometry and function of the design.
Point 3.
The introduction has been re-written to focus mainly on the conceptualization of the sensor design.
Exploiting the optical transparency feature as a means of sensing is also discussed in the introduction.
As suggested by the reviewer, the whole paper has been restructured in order to provide a more
focussed report on the results and to give better continuity to the paper. As a consequence of
restructuring the paper, the results and discussions section now provides an extensive insight into the
novel design. Another consequence of the restructuring is that the conclusions section is now succinct
and therefore this section now concisely sums up the results of the simulated data and the advantages
of using this design in the two suggested applications. There is also a greater emphasis on the specific
points and advantages of this novel design compared to the CRIT when used as a sensing device.
A short Further Work section has also been added.
Appendix B
Responses to Reviewer 3.
Point 1.
Title changed to Modelling and Simulation of Thermally-Induced Optical Transparency in a Dual Micro-
ring Resonator
Point 2
Text changed to reflect the formality of the text which now avoids colloquialisms.
Point3
Correction of grammatical errors i.e. inclusion of hyphens where suggested, resolution of ambiguity
regarding the acronym SLED/SLD. The rib fabrication and SOI process is linked in the text to my PhD
thesis and also by reference.
Point 4
In paragraph 1 beneath figure 1 the text states that the ring radii are 25um to the centre of each ring
slot. This should make the reviewers question of is the (900nm) distance between the centre of one
dual-ring resonator (1) to the centre of the other dual-ring resonator (2) somewhat superfluous.
However I do recognize how this ring-to-ring distance can still be somewhat vague so I have clarified
this ambiguity with additional text.
In paragraph 1, section 4.1 the text states The outer rings of each resonator are also separated by
900nm and this appears to be explicit and unambiguous however I have followed the reviewers
suggestion of adding some dimensions to figure 1 along with additional main text   and an
exaggerated aspect ratio is used for the figure.
As figure 1 has an exaggerated aspect ratio, a scale bar would not be appropriate.
Point 5
Equation 3.1 is analytically derived and I have added additional qualifying text to paragraph 1, section
3.1. Equation 3.2 is empirically derived as stated in the text.
Point 6
I have added  where K1, K2, K3, and K4 are the intensity transmissions for each arc section of the
rings.
Point 7
Removed superfluous bracket.
Point 8
Corrected 9ma to 9mA and legend spelling error of figure 15 from Heaterr to Heater
Point 9
As suggested by the reviewer, I have added to the introductory text The OTRR achieves the
transparency by constructive and destructive interference at the combined output of the OTRR. The
constructive and destructive interference is a consequence of the phase mismatch between the two
resonators due to the applied heat changing the optical characteristics of the waveguides. The
introduction also points to sections of the paper which describe the operational characteristics of the
CRIT induced transparency and the OTRR phase mismatch induced transparency. Specifically, section
4.3 describes how the optical transparencies are realized differently in the CRIT and OTRR.
Point 10
If only a resonance wavelength shift were to be used as an indication of sensing gas flow, then two
resonators would have to be matched with identical heaters. If one of the heaters were mismatched then
this would introduce a transparency in the output. If only one resonator with one heater were used for
gas flow sensing then this would remove the temperature invariance of the dual resonator configuration
