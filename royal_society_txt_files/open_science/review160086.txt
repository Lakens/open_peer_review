Review of manuscript RSOS-150611 entitled “Pupil dilation as an index of preferred mutual gaze
duration” submitted to Royal Society Open Science.
The manuscript represent an ambitious attempt to investigate the connection between preferred
duration of eye contact and a range of factors that might influence this preference. Especially
noteworthy is the large sample used, with almost 500 participants. This is an impressive and
timely endeavor.
Having said this, there are several shortcomings in the paper. These are outlined below.
1) The paper lacks a clear theoretical motivation for why pupil dilation, and especially
anticipatory pupil dilation, should relate in to duration of preferred eye contact. The findings are
discussed, but I get at sense that this was not expected prior to the study. How can we make sure
that this is not simply a random effect driven by multiple testing?
2) Several aspects of the study are not well described, which makes it difficult to evaluate
the paper. This includes the description of the procedure, the stimuli used, and the statistical
methods used. Just one example, for how long was the stimuli with direct gaze presented? I
realize this is not fixed, but descriptive info on duration variance should be included.
3) I cannot figure out if pupil dilation is considered another measure of how comfortable
participants feel when viewing someone that establish eye contact (an implicit measure of verbal
reports of preferred duration of eye contact) or if pupil dilation measured tell us something
unique that can be separated from the verbal reports. How should these findings be interpreted?
4) It would be useful to establish that pupil dilation is related to the key measure of interest
(duration of preferred eye contact) more specifically and that it does not relate to the duration of
another similar stimuli. For example when the eyes are closed, or while viewing naturalistic
scenes that include people that does not make eye contact with the participants. Such a
4
manipulation is needed in order to say that there is a special, or unique, relation between pupil
dilation and the duration of eye contact. Right now differences could be related to a third, more
general measure, such as involvement in the task, general anxiety, background noise during
testing, and so on.
5) There is a growing literature on pupil contagion, that an observer adjusts their own pupil
size relative to the size of others pupils. This has been demonstrated both with adults, infants,
and other species. Can this somehow explain the effect?
6) Analyzing anticipatory pupil dilations is fascinating, but given that there were no strong
hypothesis about the connection between pupil dilation and time of comfortable gaze contact,
these types of analysis should be performed with caution. Overall, the analysis appear somewhat
opportunistic and in the absence of clear hypothesis difficult to assess. If many correlations are
performed, something will surely come out significant.
7) If pupil data was baseline corrected, how come there are differences prior to the stimulus
onset that contribute, but did not introduce, the effect. This, I do not understand.
8) How should we interpret the correlation between the first PCA component of the pupil
and PGD? There needs to be a rational for this. Why this component, why anticipatory pupil
dilation. I realize that I keep coming back to this point, but I just do not see a good reason for this
relation, and the text does not help me understand this.
9) Given the large number of tests, is appropriate Bonferroni corrections applied?
10) The results include lots of text about how the analysis was done, should be moved to
methods.

The authors have responded to the majority of my concerns. But still three important issues
remain.
1) The paper report an association between anticipatory pupil dilation and the length of
comfortable direct gaze. This is an interesting topic but we have no way of assessing this relation.
No additional data is provided that indicate that this is not caused by a third variable like noise in
the background, the time of day, or any other factor. It is of course difficult to control for all of
these and that is why studies often include control conditions, run at the same time and often on
the same participants. Just to give one concrete example, imagine that there was a large crowd
trying to get into the museum on some occasions, peoples get stressed and this effect their pupil
dilations and their ratings of duration of comfortable direct gaze. But there are of course plenty of
other possibilities.
2) Pupil dilations have previously been associated with a large range of processes, attention,
cognitive load, arousal, etc. The underlying neural substrate of pupil dilation is well known and I
agree with the reviewers on this, but there are many potential psychological phenomenon that
can give rise to changes in this system. This leads to a second level of uncertainty. What is being
measured with pupil dilations in this context.
3) I still do not understand what anticipatory pupil dilations are meant to index here, to me this
suggests that there is something not related to the stimuli that influence pupil dilations (this can
as noted above be pretty much anything).

Comments to the Author(s)
First of all, congratulations to the authors on an excellent piece of work. This is important, novel
research, with an ambitious sample and good methodology. Overall, I am fairly positive!
We wish to thank the reviewer for his positive and helpful comments. Below we include a
point by point reply to the issues raised by the reviewer. All text in italic is quoted from the updated
version of the manuscript.
While I appreciate that space is at a premium, I would urge a little more pupillometry overview in
the introduction, as this proved the most informative measure in the project. One sentence (with
6 references thrown in) is thin.
We have expanded the final section of the introduction, providing more background
information on studies that motivated the exploration of a gaze duration preference / pupil dilation
relationship. More specifically, we now reference previous research linking gaze interactions to
autonomic responses, as well as studies linking pupil dilation to cortical arousal & noradrenergic
activity.
(Pg 3, Ln 24)
“Secondly we relate PGD to pupil dilation (an index of physiological arousal), motivated by
previous reports linking gaze interaction to autonomic responses [20-25]. More specifically, direct
opposed to averted gaze stimuli have been observed to elicit increased levels of arousal, as evidenced
by skin conductance [26, 27] and heart rate measures [28], as well as by increases in BOLD signal in
the Amygdala [29, 30]. Similarly, EEG measures of cortical arousal were observed to be modulated
both by direct gaze and interpersonal distance [22, 24]. Pupil dilation, which represents a reliable
index of noradrenergic activity [31-33] and cortical arousal [34], has been directly linked to gaze
behaviour by showing increased [3] and prolonged [35] responses to direct gaze stimuli. Here, we
explored in greater detail this relationship by linking direct gaze duration preference, assessed on an
individual basis, to autonomic activity measured through pupillary response”.
I appreciate the staircase approach used to assess PGD (regardless of my feelings about Bayesian
approaches), but cannot help but wonder why there wasn't a "just right" response option which,
over repeated trials, could have provided an ever better fit of PGD to subjective experience. If the
authors have issues with subjective experience, these are not alleviated by forcing participants to
choose "too little" or "too much" (both subjective), especially on trials where neither would apply.
I think that the choices made to identify PGD are core to results and ensuing conclusions, and thus
should be elaborated more, especially in the discussion whereby limits posed on interpretation
should be discussed
The choice of an adaptive staircase approach and the binary “too short / too long” response
was motivated by a principle of economy. We went for a methodology that would yield
(Pg 6, Ln 18)
“…reliable estimates of PGD with the smallest number of trials possible. A limited number of
trials was mandatory in order to minimize fatigue in naïve participants and to achieve an optimal
testing turnover rate. Through initial piloting we had preliminarily determined we could get
reasonably good psychometric fits of participant responses as a function of direct gaze duration with
as few as 40 trials”.
We did not include a “just right” response as it would have led to a less efficient design,
without significantly improving the estimation of PGD.
As for the results themselves, I have reservations given the overly complicated nature of the
analyses, and arbitrary choices made along the way, and the apparent lack of correction for
MULTIPLE tests. I can't criticize the QUEST approach as it follows from the response choice
decisions discussed in the previous paragraph, and as such was constrained prior to analyses.
Thank you for pointing out this oversight, we have now Bonferroni corrected correlation p
values. This has been updated in the text, and in Supporting Information Table 2.
(Pg 12, Ln 13)
“Pupil signal 1st Component scores (PC1 scores), which summarize for each participant the
rate in pupil diameter increase (occurring in the 200ms anticipatory window preceding the stimulus
onset, and in the 500ms t-ROI window following stimulus onset), were correlated with participant
age, PGD, the 4 actor face rating scores (dominance, threat, attractiveness, trustworthiness), and the
5 personality trait scores (extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness)
(see Supporting information, Table 2). We only observed significant PGD / PC1 score correlations, for
both the 200ms anticipatory window and the 500ms t-ROI window (anticipatory window: r=.16,
p=.001; trial t-ROI window: r=.18, p=3.21e-4; Bonferroni corrected critical p = .0045; Figure 3c & 3d)”.
With respect to pupillometry specifically, I have been keen for analyses that try and preserve, as
much as possible, the temporal nature of the data. That may be a personal preference, but then
again I presume it is my work on that very topic that has seen me invited to review! In a recent
review of pupillometry (Sirois and Brisson, WIRES Cog Sc, 2014), we discuss the issue of
pupillometry analysis. I have favored functional data analysis, which removes the serious problem
of reducing temporal data to discrete values within arbitrary windows. But there are other
approaches as well, such as deconvolution, which may be used. If the authors are fully happy with
and committed to their chosen approach, then maybe minimally they could discuss their findings
in relation to the constraints they have created, and how other approaches (not necessarily the
one I favor) could helpfully shed additional/different light on the topic.
We now complement the PCA analysis with a b-spline interpolation FDA approach, which as
you point out preserves temporal information. We use this approach to identify at what time points
differences in pupil response emerge between L-PGD and S-PGD groups. This helps us identify a
suitable temporal Region Of Interest (t-ROI) in which to constrain the PCA.
(Pg 9, Ln 12).
We provide a methodological breakdown of this approach: “In order to test differences in
pupil dilation as a function of Preferred Gaze duration, we assigned participants to short and long
PGD groups (S-PGD and L-PGD, respectively) drawing them from 6 progressively smaller Sampling
Areas (SA) of the population PGD distribution (SAs, 1-6, from 0 to 1.5 standard deviations from
population mean PGD; Figure 2a, Supporting Information Figure 1a). This was done to evaluate
whether progressively greater differences in PGD between S-PGD and L-PGD groups (determined by
sampling participants at progressively larger distances from the mean PGD), would result in
progressively larger differences in pupil signal. We adopted a Functional Data Analysis approach [34,
44, 45] to test differences in pupil signal between S-PGD and L-PGD groups across time at the 6 SAs
described above. We computed for each participant the average percent change in pupil diameter
across all trials and fit the resulting time series with a b-spline interpolation function [34, 44]. At each
SA, we assigned participants (based on their PGD) to either the S-PGD or L-PGD group and computed
an average b-spline function per group (Supporting Information Figure 1a). 2 Sample t-tests were run
on the resulting averaged b-spline functions, testing for differences in pupil signal between S-PGD
and L-PGD groups across time. At SA-1 we observed no significant difference between S-PGD and L-
PGD averaged b-spline functions at any time point. For SA-2 through SA-6, we observe significant
differences between S-PGD and L-PGD averaged b-spline functions between 0 and 500 ms (SA-2), 0
and 900 ms (SA-3), 0 and 567 ms (SA-4), 0 and 933 ms (SA-5), 0 and 4400 ms (SA-6) (Supporting
Information Figure 1b). Within all these instances averaged pupil diameter was greater in the L-PGD
group than in the S-PGD group. These windows of significant difference seemed to roughly increase
in size across SA groupings. In order to further assess differences in L-PGD and S-PGD groups, and
relate these differences to other participant variables (age, PGD, face rating scores & personality
trait scores), we ran a covariance principal component analysis (PCA) on pupil signal within a fixed
500ms temporal Region Of Interest (t-ROI), which we defined based on the overlap of windows of
significant difference in pupil signal between L-PGD & S-PGD groups across the 6 SAs as described
above (Supporting Information Figure 1c).”
We also explain that while the PCA (which is also an instance of FDA) sacrifices time
information, it summarizes for each participant the rate of pupil diameter increase in the initial t-ROI
with a single score, which can then be correlated with all other participant variables (age, PGD, the
actor face rating scores and the personality trait scores).
(Pg 12, Ln 13)
“Pupil signal 1st Component scores (PC1 scores), which summarize for each participant the
rate in pupil diameter increase (occurring in the 200ms anticipatory window preceding the stimulus
onset, and in the 500ms t-ROI window following stimulus onset), were correlated with participant
age, PGD, the 4 actor face rating scores (dominance, threat, attractiveness, trustworthiness), and the
5 personality trait scores (extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness)
(see Supporting information, Table 2).
I stress again that I remain very favorable to the manuscript, and I think that it would make an
excellent contribution to the journal and to the field.

Review of manuscript RSOS-150611 entitled “Pupil dilation as an index of preferred mutual gaze
duration” submitted to Royal Society Open Science.
The manuscript represent an ambitious attempt to investigate the connection between preferred
duration of eye contact and a range of factors that might influence this preference. Especially
noteworthy is the large sample used, with almost 500 participants. This is an impressive and
timely endeavor.
Having said this, there are several shortcomings in the paper. These are outlined below.
We thank the reviewer for her/his constructive comments. Below we include a point by
point reply to the issues raised by the reviewer. All text in italic is quoted from the updated version
of the manuscript.
1) The paper lacks a clear theoretical motivation for why pupil dilation, and especially
anticipatory pupil dilation, should relate in to duration of preferred eye contact. The findings are
discussed, but I get at sense that this was not expected prior to the study. How can we make sure
that this is not simply a random effect driven by multiple testing?
We apologize for not having made this clearer in the original manuscript. The reason for
exploring the relationship between Preferred Gaze Duration (PGD) and pupil response was
motivated by a large number of previous studies linking direct gaze behaviour to arousal (measured
through skin galvanic response, heart rate, EEG, fMRI and pupil dilation). This body of research
strongly suggested the possibility of a measurable effect of gaze duration preference on pupillary
response, which is a known index of cortical arousal. We now clearly stated this in the introduction:
(Pg 3, Ln 24)
“Secondly we relate PGD to pupil dilation (an index of physiological arousal), motivated by
previous reports linking gaze interaction to autonomic responses [20-25]. More specifically, direct
opposed to averted gaze stimuli have been observed to elicit increased levels of arousal, as evidenced
by skin conductance [26, 27] and heart rate measures [28], as well as by increases in BOLD signal in
the Amygdala [29, 30]. Similarly, EEG measures of cortical arousal were observed to be modulated
both by direct gaze and interpersonal distance [22, 24]. Pupil dilation, which represents a reliable
index of noradrenergic activity [31-33] and cortical arousal [34], has been directly linked to gaze
behaviour by showing increased [3] and prolonged [35] responses to direct gaze stimuli. Here, we
explored in greater detail this relationship by linking direct gaze duration preference, assessed on an
individual basis, to autonomic activity measured through pupillary response”.
However, based on these very same studies, there was no prior evidence suggesting how
gaze duration preference might relate to pupil dilation (i.e. whether a preference for long durations
would positively - or negatively - correlate with rate of pupil increase). As such, we had no a priori
assumption on the sign of this relationship, and assessed differences using the more conservative
two-tailed hypothesis.
As for the multiple tests, we have now Bonferroni corrected correlation p values. This has
been updated in the text, and in Supporting Information Table 2.
(Pg 12, Ln 13)
“Pupil signal 1st Component scores (PC1 scores), which summarize for each participant the
rate in pupil diameter increase (occurring in the 200ms anticipatory window preceding the stimulus
onset, and in the 500ms t-ROI window following stimulus onset), were correlated with participant
age, PGD, the 4 actor face rating scores (dominance, threat, attractiveness, trustworthiness), and the
5 personality trait scores (extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness)
(see Supporting information, Table 2). We only observed significant PGD / PC1 score correlations, for
both the 200ms anticipatory window and the 500ms t-ROI window (anticipatory window: r=.16,
p=.001; trial t-ROI window: r=.18, p=3.21e-4; Bonferroni corrected critical p = .0045; Figure 3c & 3d).”
The anticipatory dissociation was not expected and represents a serendipitous finding.
When testing differences as a function of Long Vs Short Preferred Gaze Duration (L-PGD and S-PGD),
we found within the first 500ms after the stimulus onset a faster rate of pupil dilation in the L-PGD
group. We noticed also that the intercepts of the L-PGD and S-PGD averaged functions occurred at
slightly different coordinates on the y-axis. This suggested that systematic differences in L-PGD and
S-PGD pupil signals were already taking place prior to the stimulus onset. On further inspection we
found a faster rate of pupil dilation in the L-PGD group in a 200 ms window preceding the stimulus
onset. This anticipatory dissociation was consistent with the dissociation observed after the stimulus
onset, both in terms of sign (rate of pupil increase in the L-PGD group > S-PGD group) and in terms of
scaling with PGD (the greater the difference in PGD between groups, the greater the differences in
rate of pupil dilation; Figure 3, upper row panels). The consistency in these results (in terms of sign
and scaling as a function of PGD) is unlikely to result from occasional false positives that can arise
when running multiple tests.
2) Several aspects of the study are not well described, which makes it difficult to evaluate the
paper. This includes the description of the procedure, the stimuli used, and the statistical methods
used. Just one example, for how long was the stimuli with direct gaze presented? I realize this is
not fixed, but descriptive info on duration variance should be included.
We have now moved more in depth descriptions of the experimental setup, stimuli and
analysis from the Supporting Information to the main body of the manuscript. We have also
expanded the paragraph describing the analysis of pupil data and added information on the timing
of stimuli.
(Pg 5, Ln 20)
Stimuli: “Stimuli consisted of video clips of 8 different actors (4 female, 4 male; all Caucasian,
20 – 33 yrs range). Video clips were edited so the eye region roughly occupied an equivalent area on
the screen and the bridge of the nose (nasion) of all actors was aligned with the screen centre. Actor
clips were recorded against a green background in diffuse lighting conditions. Prior to each trial, the
nasion position was cued by a black central fixation cross presented on a grey background to ensure
homogeneity in participants’ first fixation. The stimulus therefore provided a visual reference aiding
the binary classification task based on prior experience in real life dyadic interactions. After the
participant’s response in each trial, a grey screen with the fixation point appeared for 1 second”.
and,
(Pg 6, Ln 6)
Stimulus timing: “In each clip the actor directly gazed at the participant for a variable
amount of time (between 100 and 10300ms, in 300ms increments, resulting in 35 possible clips)
preceded and followed by a 500ms averted gaze directed at the bottom of the screen. Clip duration
was selected based on randomly perturbed PGD estimates yielded by two interleaved QUEST
adaptive staircase routines [27]. On average participants were shown video clips lasting 3905 +/-
1645ms (which is equivalent to a 2905 +/- 1645ms exposure to direct gaze, having subtracted the
500 + 500 ms of averted gaze in the beginning and end of each trial)”.
(Pg 9, Ln 12)
Pupil data: “In order to test differences in pupil dilation as a function of Preferred Gaze
duration, we assigned participants to short and long PGD groups (S-PGD and L-PGD, respectively)
drawing them from 6 progressively smaller Sampling Areas (SA) of the population PGD distribution
(SAs, 1-6, from 0 to 1.5 standard deviations from population mean PGD; Figure 2a, Supporting
Information Figure 1a). This was done to evaluate whether progressively greater differences in PGD
between S-PGD and L-PGD groups (determined by sampling participants at progressively larger
distances from the mean PGD), would result in progressively larger differences in pupil signal. We
adopted a Functional Data Analysis approach [34, 44, 45] to test differences in pupil signal between
S-PGD and L-PGD groups across time at the 6 SAs described above. We computed for each
participant the average percent change in pupil diameter across all trials and fit the resulting time
series with a b-spline interpolation function [34, 44]. At each SA, we assigned participants (based on
their PGD) to either the S-PGD or L-PGD group and computed an average b-spline function per group
(Supporting Information Figure 1a). 2 Sample t-tests were run on the resulting averaged b-spline
functions, testing for differences in pupil signal between S-PGD and L-PGD groups across time. At SA-
1 we observed no significant difference between S-PGD and L-PGD averaged b-spline functions at any
time point. For SA-2 through SA-6, we observe significant differences between S-PGD and L-PGD
averaged b-spline functions between 0 and 500 ms (SA-2), 0 and 900 ms (SA-3), 0 and 567 ms (SA-4),
0 and 933 ms (SA-5), 0 and 4400 ms (SA-6) (Supporting Information Figure 1b). Within all these
instances averaged pupil diameter was greater in the L-PGD group than in the S-PGD group. These
windows of significant difference seemed to roughly increase in size across SA groupings. In order to
further assess differences in L-PGD and S-PGD groups, and relate these differences to other
participant variables (age, PGD, face rating scores & personality trait scores), we ran a covariance
principal component analysis (PCA) on pupil signal within a fixed 500ms temporal Region Of Interest
(t-ROI), which we defined based on the overlap of windows of significant difference in pupil signal
between L-PGD & S-PGD groups across the 6 SAs as described above (Supporting Information Figure
1c)”.
We have also provided more information on the PCA analysis (covered in our response to
point 8).
3) I cannot figure out if pupil dilation is considered another measure of how comfortable
participants feel when viewing someone that establish eye contact (an implicit measure of verbal
reports of preferred duration of eye contact) or if pupil dilation measured tell us something
unique that can be separated from the verbal reports. How should these findings be interpreted?
We elaborate this point in the text by saying:
(Pg 16, Ln 9)
“..the rate of pupil dilation provides a physiological correlate of the subjective preference of
direct gaze duration. The PC1 score / PGD correlation implies that one could in theory predict a
participant’s PGD based solely on the rate of pupil dilation in response to direct gaze stimuli, in the
absence of any verbal report”.
Also, pupil response can provide some insights into differences in noradrenergic activity in
the SNC in response to direct gaze: in the manuscript we speculate that exposure to direct gaze
information might elicit stronger response in noradrenergic brain circuits in participants that favour
longer direct gaze.
4) It would be useful to establish that pupil dilation is related to the key measure of interest
(duration of preferred eye contact) more specifically and that it does not relate to the duration of
another similar stimuli. For example when the eyes are closed, or while viewing naturalistic scenes
that include people that does not make eye contact with the participants. Such a manipulation is
needed in order to say that there is a special, or unique, relation between pupil dilation and the
duration of eye contact. Right now differences could be related to a third, more general measure,
such as involvement in the task, general anxiety, background noise during testing, and so on.
A factor that could potentially influence performance could be task difficulty. We now
discuss this possibility in the manuscript:
(Pg 16, Ln 13).
“However, the PGD / pupil dilation correlation might be more generically related to an effect
of task difficulty on pupil dilation, which has been frequently documented in the pupillometry
literature [72, 73]. Stimulus durations were selected with a QUEST staircase: as trials progress and
evidence is accumulated through participant responses, the tested durations converge towards the
participant’s PGD. This implies that participants with longer PGDs were on average presented longer
direct gaze stimuli than participants with shorter PGDs. Because of the scalar property, where
variability of time estimates scale proportionally to the duration of a timed interval [39, 40], this
suggests that stimuli near longer PGDs are harder to classify than stimuli near shorter PGDs.
Therefore we have the possibility that the faster rate of pupil dilation in the L-PGD group is due to
greater task demands relative to the S-PGD group. Two facts however work against this possibility.
The first is that the difference in pupil dilation between L-PGD and S-PGD groups was observed in the
very first 500ms of the stimulus, while effects of task difficulty should be expected to emerge during
the decisional phase that follows the encoding of the actual stimulus [74]. The second is that the L-
PGD / S-PGD pupil dissociation anticipates the onset of the stimulus (i.e. is prior to the actual start of
the timing task)”.
As for the specificity of the effect to direct gaze information (as opposed to the duration of
any given stimulus): we have recently collected new data where we compare pupil dilation in
response to direct gaze shifts to pupil dilation in response to equivalent Gabor patch phase shifts.
We find pupil dilation effects for the gaze conditions only. This work is currently being prepared for
submission.
We also specify that:
(Pg 17, Ln 1)
“Differences in the stimuli are unlikely to account for the effect, as it would imply that the
stimuli, or the testing conditions, systematically differed between the L-PGD and S-PGD groups. The 8
actors presented (which might account for differences in the stimuli) were equally distributed across
the L-PGD and S-PGD groups”.
Differences in participant anxiety levels (in response to the stimulus duration) are also an
unlikely cause of the effect. As stated above,
(Pg 17, Ln 5).
“Because of the staircase approach, tested durations converged towards each participant’s
PGD, which implies that all participant were on average presented equally pleasant / unpleasant
stimulus durations”.
5) There is a growing literature on pupil contagion, that an observer adjusts their own pupil size
relative to the size of others pupils. This has been demonstrated both with adults, infants, and
other species. Can this somehow explain the effect?
While we didn’t specifically check for differences in pupil dilation across the 8 actor video
clips, it is unlikely that any differences across actors explain the relationship between participant
PGD & pupil dilation, since the actor clips were equally distributed across L-PGD and S-PGD groups.
6) Analyzing anticipatory pupil dilations is fascinating, but given that there were no strong
hypothesis about the connection between pupil dilation and time of comfortable gaze contact,
these types of analysis should be performed with caution. Overall, the analysis appear somewhat
opportunistic and in the absence of clear hypothesis difficult to assess. If many correlations are
performed, something will surely come out significant.
We have now motivated our analysis more clearly (following advice from both reviewers)
throughout the paper. As stated in the reply to point 1, the anticipatory dissociation was consistent
with the dissociation observed after the stimulus onset, both in terms of sign (rate of pupil increase
in the L-PGD group > S-PGD group) and in terms of scaling with PGD (the greater the difference in
PGD between groups, the greater the differences in rate of pupil dilation; Figure 3, upper row
panels). We also note that we now Bonferroni correct multiple tests.
7) If pupil data was baseline corrected, how come there are differences prior to the stimulus
onset that contribute, but did not introduce, the effect. This, I do not understand.
We apologize that we did not make this clear in the text. What we meant was that the
differences between L-PGD and S-PGD pupil signals were not solely determined by differences in the
intercept values. When vertically repositioning the averaged pupil functions so their intercepts
occurred at y=0, we found weaker, but still significantly different 1st component scores between L-
PGD / S-PGD groups.
(Pg 11, Ln 19)
“The L-PGD groups still showed higher 1st component scores than the S-PGD groups.
Therefore, even after eliminating differences in the intercepts, L-PGD and S-PGD pupil signals still
differed due to different rates of pupil dilation following the presentation of the stimulus”.
This however led to another question: what determined these different intercept values? In
order to answer this question we explored the pupil signal prior to the stimulus onset (i.e. the period
that provides the baseline for the trial). We found systematic differences between L-PGD and S-PGD
groups arising in a 200 / 400 ms window prior to the stimulus onset, thus showing what we interpret
to be an anticipatory pupillary response to the upcoming direct gaze stimulus.
8) How should we interpret the correlation between the first PCA component of the pupil and
PGD? There needs to be a rational for this. Why this component, why anticipatory pupil dilation. I
realize that I keep coming back to this point, but I just do not see a good reason for this relation,
and the text does not help me understand this.
We now expand on these points in the body of the manuscript:
(PG 10, Ln 15)
“We ran a PCA on the % increase in pupil diameter, with participants as observations and the
t-ROI time samples as variables. The PCA yielded a series of components, ranked in terms of the
percentage of variance in pupil data they explained (the first 3 components can be seen in the 2nd
row of Figure 2). We used the elbow criterion [47, 48] to determine which components to retain in
order to provide a sufficiently accurate summary of the information in the pupil data. We retained
only the 1st component (PC1), which depicts a roughly linear increase in pupil diameter as a function
of time, since it explained most of the information (90% explained variance). We calculated each
participant’s 1st component score (i.e. PC1 score) which represents the coordinate occupied by each
participant in PC1 space: the higher the participant’s score, the greater the participant’s rate of pupil
dilation. Finally, we tested differences between L-PGD participants and S-PGD participants to see
whether PGD had an influence on rate of pupil dilation”.
9) Given the large number of tests, is appropriate Bonferroni corrections applied?
See points 1 & 6.
10) The results include lots of text about how the analysis was done, should be moved
to methods.
Given the complexity of the eyetracking analysis, we feel that keeping the methodology near
the results aids readability and comprehension. This is particularly relevant for the anticipatory pupil
response section that was motivated by our initial analysis of pupil responses (following stimulus
onset). As such we feel that the logic is easier to follow by not fully segregating the methodology
from the results. We have nonetheless now modified the headers in the paper to more clearly
reflect the content.
Appendix B
Dear Prof Viding, Dr Bird & Dr Allinson,
Thank you for dealing with our submission. Please find enclosed the revised version of the
manuscript entitled “Pupil dilation as an index of preferred mutual gaze duration” (ID RSOS-
160086), co-authored by Nicola Binetti, Charlotte Harrison, Antoine Coutrot, Alan Johnston &
Isabelle Mareschal, that we resubmit for consideration to Royal Society Open Science. We wish to
thank reviewer 2 for her/his constructive inputs. We hope we have now addressed all remaining
concerns and look forward to hearing from you. Edited text has been marked in red in the revised
version of the manuscript.
Sincerely,
Nicola Binetti
1) The paper report an association between anticipatory pupil dilation and the length of comfortable
direct gaze. This is an interesting topic but we have no way of assessing this relation. No additional
data is provided that indicate that this is not caused by a third variable like noise in the
background, the time of day, or any other factor. It is of course difficult to control for all of these
and that is why studies often include control conditions, run at the same time and often on the
same participants. Just to give one concrete example, imagine that there was a large crowd trying
to get into the museum on some occasions, peoples get stressed and this effect their pupil
dilations and their ratings of duration of comfortable direct gaze. But there are of course plenty of
other possibilities.
We understand the reviewer’s concern. In the previous revision we explored – and discounted –
several factors that could have potentially accounted for the relationship between Preferred Gaze Duration
(PGD) and pupil increase (such as task difficulty, differences in actor and/or testing station, differences in
participant anxiety levels, and emotional valence of stimuli). Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, we have
now also controlled for time of the day (1 hour bins), which did not correlate with either PGD (r=.03, p=1,
Bonferroni corrected), nor with pupil increase (r=-.09, p=.7, Bonferroni corrected). This is now mentioned in
the Discussion section (Pg 16, Ln 23).
As the reviewer notes, it is always possible that there are uncontrolled variables that might
contribute to the effect. This is true for any between group comparisons. However we think we have ruled
out the most likely spurious factors that might have contributed to the effect. One of the values of having a
large N is that it is less likely that some uncontrolled for variable would by chance influence the comparison
we are reporting.
2) Pupil dilations have previously been associated with a large range of processes, attention,
cognitive load, arousal, etc. The underlying neural substrate of pupil dilation is well known and I
agree with the reviewers on this, but there are many potential psychological phenomenon that can
give rise to changes in this system. This leads to a second level of uncertainty. What is being
measured with pupil dilations in this context.
Our assumptions regarding what is being measured through pupil dilation mainly rest on
evidence provided within the pupillometry/physiology literatures, i.e. that this is a reflection of
noradrenergic activity. Obviously, pupil dilation only provides an indirect measure of this activity.
While we offer some potential explanatory accounts in the Discussion section, we leave the
identification of the neural mechanisms linking pupil dilation to gaze duration preference to studies
providing direct measures of brain activity. We have stressed this point in the Discussion section (Pg
17, Ln 23).
3) I still do not understand what anticipatory pupil dilations are meant to index here, to me this
suggests that there is something not related to the stimuli that influence pupil dilations (this can as
noted above be pretty much anything).
While the dissociation in pupil responses slightly anticipates the stimuli, these responses are
clearly time-locked to the stimuli’s onset. The dissociation emerges 200ms prior to the onset of the stimulus
(and persists throughout its presentation), while it is not observable at the earlier 400 and 600ms time
frames (see supporting information Fig. 2). This denotes a stimulus-dependent preparatory response,
which is conceptually equivalent to CNS activity that is known to ramp up in anticipation of a cued target
(e.g. the readiness potential). In the present case, participants are fully aware of when the stimulus will
appear since they manually trigger its presentation with the button press at the end of the previous trial.
Therefore, while the pupil dissociation begins slightly ahead of the stimulus’ onset, it is causally linked to its
presentation and to its processing.
