Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The authors attempted to make sense of a very complex subject for which we still have little
supporting data available. The subject is indeed very interesting but the complexity of the system
inevitably resulted in a somewhat subjective manuscript. However, although biased by the
present level of knowledge on the ecology and evolution of associations, the attempt is valid and
bring some insights to the problem posed. I am also not a fan of this perspective of bottom-up
conservation nor I believe that conservation should be about the reduction of extinctions
(especially if they are not catalyzed by human activities). However, the manuscript indicates
specific points to help us understand how agents (hosts, parasites, environment/climate)
integrate and generate unexpected patterns in higher levels of complexity is indeed dependent in
approaches like this one. With that in mind, I do have a few comments that the authors may
want to consider prior to final acceptance to publication (or even for additional developments on
the subject):
1. They have not explored the information on the past history of associations to postulate
about past extinctions (and diversification) and to understand the significance of the traits they
propose. There are many studies encompassing several groups of macro-parasites that can, I am
sure, provide a supporting perspective to the traits suggested by the authors. Ecological data
provides limited support to some of the points they discusses (e.g. phylogenetic conservatism of
“extinction” potential).
2. As most publications, the concept of specialists and generalist is far from being clear.
This is especially important because some of their conclusions is based on these concepts. For
instance (and this incorporates the above item as well), monogenes are "apparently" highly host-
specific for most cases, but once they are placed in a same aquarium, the barriers for
incorporation of new host lineages disappear completely! It would be interesting to revise the
concept of “faux specialist” (and others) of Brooks, D. R., & McLennan, D. A. (2012). The nature of
diversity: an evolutionary voyage of discovery. University of Chicago. Press.
3. Further, as mentioned by the previous referee: “The fact that eradicating (i.e. reducing
their global number of individuals to 0) disease of the previous referees has proved, in all cases
with (hopefully) the notable exception of dracunculiasis, should make us reflect about the
possibility that parasites may have more ways to survive extinctions than we think they have.”
From my research, they are more effective in incorporating new host species than we ever
considered, something that explains much of the Emergent Infectious Diseases outbreaks we are
observing these years.
4. All above, associated with the climate and environmental disruption we are facing,
suggest an increase in extinction rates but also an increase in “host-switching”. Thus, change is
expected – and includes extinctions, of course, but also host-range changes (hence, the expected
co-extinction will likely be smaller). Host-range variation should become more significant
especially because animal species are expected to change their range of distribution with change
in climate. Under this scenario, host and parasite species of distinct communities are likely to
come in contact, increasing the possibility of host-switching by “faux specialists”. And if host-
range change increases, diversification will likely follow. One of the most impressive examples of
the resilience of parasite species is seem in the marine-derived parasites that were capable of
accompanying the intensive colonization of marine-derived host species (mainly fishes) of
continental waters in South America. And this was independent of life cycle pattern, for instance!
Even lineages with complex life cycles were capable to successfully transferring into a completely
3
new community! That should tell us something! You may want to check: Malcicka, M., Agosta,
S. J., & Harvey, J. A. (2015). Multi level ecological fitting: indirect life cycles are not a barrier
to host switching and invasion.Global change biology, 21(9), 3210-3218.
5. Based on still-limited historical reconstructions, the overall change in diversification,
following environmental perturbations, should be immediately small, but should rapidly (in
geological time, of course), pick up. Thus, in the introduction or discussion, it would be
interesting to understand where you come from. I am sorry if I insist on this, but I don’t think
there would be a destruction of the host-parasite networks in a community but simply a
rearrangement. It seems to me that your concern with co-extinctions is associated to immediate
changes that may occur in the biological processes of a community. But, I guess, I am curious to
know to what extent do you think this is really significant for conservation. Avoid changes?
6. Despite an apparent divergence in our perspectives about conservation, I like the
analysis of possible traits associated with parasites vulnerability. However, it is, maybe, too late
to foment studies on a broad range of host-parasite associations but I would also suggest adding
experimental studies and historical analyses of associations. The first would allow testing
specific abilities of parasite lineages to survive by host-switching (using, real-time experiments or
natural experiments provided by invasive species, for instance). In fact, there are experimental
studies with some specific taxa already published (e.g. King, T. A., & Cable, J. (2007).
Experimental infections of the monogenean Gyrodactylus turnbulli indicate that it is not a strict
specialist. International Journal for Parasitology, 37(6), 663-672.).
Historical analyses should also provide important insights on the significance of the traits
suggested by the authors for “parasite vulnerability”/extinction.
But I do like the study and recommend that it should be published. Most of the comments above
are really food-for-thought! Use as desired ;-)

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
While I found the authors topic to be one of broad interest and clearly warranting a review, I
found their paper extremely difficult to follow and have major issues with some of their logic,
examples, and source use. I have misgivings when I find two incorrectly cited sources in a paper
(21 & 48), but I don’t have time to fact-check every source. I ask the authors to carefully review
every one of their sources during this revision.
1. I second the previous reviewer #1’s comment of “I think the paper would gain from a
more differentiated consideration of "extinction" (time- and spacewise more differentiated
definitions)”. P2 line 17 states “54% of species facing extinction”, but by when? Surely not the 15
years mentioned in the second half of that statement?
2. On P3 line 22 you state that you focus on “macroscopic endoparasites”, but then the
literature you cite in that same paragraph is not limited to that parasite ‘group’. You also never
state how common such parasite are nor what are their “other life history attributes” that make
them “uniquely sensitive”, nor do you compare them with microscopic or ectoparasites to
validate such claims. Throughout the manuscript you use ticks and mosquitoes as examples,
despite the fact they are not macroscopic endoparasites. Throughout the paper it is unclear when
you are restricting your statements to your focal group or talking about parasites in general, this
must be fixed.
3. Overall, more clear use of sources would be appreciated. Grand statements are made
without any description of how broadly or narrowly such patterns have actually be observed in
nature.
4. Line 44 – source 21. Please reread the source, this is not a clam that paper makes (nor
even a topic it covers).
5. Line 49. “we argue that climate-driven parasite extinction and disease emergence are
complementary processes, as more virulent pathogens may experience competitive release as rare
species go extinct”. You need sources to back up your bold clam. Couldn’t low host population
size/density select for less virulent parasites?
6. Line 60. Does 7% refer to invertebrates or parasites?
7. Line 64. Why is it important to focus on parasite traits independent of their host’s risk? If
most parasite extinction risk is linked with host declines/extinctions, wouldn’t it be more
prudent to focus on joint host-parasite consercation strategies. Why does focusing on just this
subclass of parasite-only extinction risks make them more robust and applicable across parasite
groups? This idea is particularly confusing given that you go on to say (lines 135-140) that large
host body size is an extinction risk for parasites because large hosts have higher extinction risk.
The host specificity section also links host extinction and parasite extinction. In line 198 you even
say directly “Host susceptibility to primary extinction may thus be the best predictor of parasite
extinction risk”. This directly contradicts what you are setting up in line 64.
8. Lines 81-82. Acclimation is an individual level process and I don’t get how your
following section addresses acclimation at all
9. Line 88. I was totally confused to see “large” here since larger organisms are less
poikilotherimic and are less affected by ambient temperature fluctuations. Your later paragraph
on why large host body size could affect extinction risk as nothing to do with parasites being
buffered from ambient temperatures. Host largeness needs its own number here with its separate
reasons outlined.
10. Line 91. The “transmission” category needs to clearly say something about
environmental parasite life stages. It currently sounds limited to “biotic interaction”. This idea
needs to be introduced here so your reador doesn’t think you are overlooking something that you
acknowledge is likely the best predictor of the vulnerability of many parasite species to climate
change (line 143).
11. I completely did not understand the authors descriptions of temperature-immune
tradeoffs in homeotherms and poikilotherms (line 111-12). Do poikilotherms suffer reduced
immunity at high temperatures or just low ones? Don’t most poikilotherms behaviorally regulate
5
their temperatures and how much is this expected to shift with climate change? Its very
confusing to set this up, then have the most concrete example (source 32) contradict it entirely (its
not warming but “unpredictiable temperature change” that has larger effects on immunity to
chytrid). Its also very odd to end this section saying that body size is probably a bigger driver,
before you explain why host body size is a driver of extinction risk.
12. Line 115-117. “However, the availability of such resources may be beneficial for
parasites, leading to many examples of the fittest individuals harboring the highest parasitic
burdens.” What does this sentence mean, what is the source, and what are the “resources” being
referred to?
13. Line 128. Larger INDIVIDUALS or SPECIES? Larger species also tend to have lower
mass-specific metabolic rates, larger energy stores, and greater capacity to withstand temporary
food shortages. Surely these factors are worth mentioning?
14. Line 132-134. “higher host specificity [29], a trait already associated with the higher
proportional richness due to the asymmetric nature of host-parasite webs”. This needs to be more
fully explained and the scope of host/parasite systems studied acknowledged.
15. Line 171. “Finally” should start a new paragraph that should more fully explain the rest
of the sentence (and the scope of sources). I couldn’t find anything about generalist and
sensitivity to perturbation in source 48. The conclusion sentence was odd to me, particularly
given that you just mentioned that parasite generalism/specificity can vary by lifestage. This
critical idea needs to be followed up upon and related to risk of extinction (or why bother to
mention at all?)
16. Line 184. Here’s another one of those spots where the scope of hosts and parasites in this
literature needs to be mentioned.
17. Line 187. How can you start a paragraph with “consequently”? As a consequence of
what? This paragraph also discusses ectoparasites, which I thought were outside the scope of this
paper.
18. Line 198. Yes, host susceptibility to extinction is going to be critical, as is stated in many
(if not all) previous papers on this topic. I think your case would be stronger if you acknowledged
this idea first, then explained into how there are additional features that you are reviewing that
can contribute to this. It will make your paper sound more informed and novel, rather than
hiding the same old punchline at the end. (I felt this same sentiment when the enviromental
parasite lifestages came last in the previous section).
19. I thought the host range shifts section was stronger and more clearly written than the
other sections (even though ectoparasites (ticks) are used as the primary example (line 219).
However, I wasn’t quite convinced that lags in parasite dispersal will contribute to extinctions. I
think this is a point you need to clearly articulate and discuss with respect to uncertainty of how
long until extinction at old site vs. how long until movement to new site.
20. Line 248. Won’t hosts be moving to cooler more hospitable environments? If they stayed,
climate change would eventually cause it to be warmer and less hospitable, but isn’t that what
they are escaping by moving poleward/higher in elevation? Why would species move to hotter
locations? I also still don’t understand the temperature-immune thing (and its not cited here).
21. Line 252-254. Here’s another one of those spots where the scope of hosts and parasites in
this literature needs to be mentioned.
22. Line 265. The implications of the Lafferty study are unclear. What is “insurance” in this
context?
23. Line 277. I thought the whole point of this review was to find robust factors that could be
used to predict extinction risk, so then why say that critical knowledge gaps can only be
identified within “each field” (which fields?).
24. Line 283-284. Here’s another one of those spots where the scope of hosts and parasites in
this literature needs to be mentioned.
25. Line 285. Why are you talking about vector borne parasites? Why mention density
dependence here for the first time if its important? The (possibly very important) point you are
trying to make in the second half of this impossibly long sentence is lost.
6
26. Line 289-290. What is “minor decoupling”?
27. Lines 300-303. What taxa is this limited to? Only fish? What does it mean for parasite
extinction risk if clustering is only seen half the time and hot/cold spots are not predictable?
28. Figure 2 contains many terms not included in the paper: biotic pathway, abiotic
pathway, adaptive capacity, aggression, interspecific competition, and perhaps others. Its form
also does not match that of the paper. I do not see how it supports the paper or adds anything to
it.
29. Figure 3 is so confusing that its message is completely lost. I think the idea of a shrinking
hypervolume is easier to imagine than depict clearly.

The authors attempted to make sense of a very complex subject for which we still have little
supporting data available. The subject is indeed very interesting but the complexity of the system
inevitably resulted in a somewhat subjective manuscript. However, although biased by the
present level of knowledge on the ecology and evolution of associations, the attempt is valid and
bring some insights to the problem posed. I am also not a fan of this perspective of bottom-up
conservation nor I believe that conservation should be about the reduction of extinctions
(especially if they are not catalyzed by human activities). However, the manuscript indicates
specific points to help us understand how agents (hosts, parasites, environment/climate)
integrate and generate unexpected patterns in higher levels of complexity is indeed dependent in
approaches like this one. With that in mind, I do have a few comments that the authors may
want to consider prior to final acceptance to publication (or even for additional developments on
the subject):
1. They have not explored the information on the past history of associations to postulate
about past extinctions (and diversification) and to understand the significance of the traits they
propose. There are many studies encompassing several groups of macro-parasites that can, I am
sure, provide a supporting perspective to the traits suggested by the authors. Ecological data
provides limited support to some of the points they discusses (e.g. phylogenetic conservatism of
“extinction” potential).
2. As most publications, the concept of specialists and generalist is far from being clear.
This is especially important because some of their conclusions is based on these concepts. For
instance (and this incorporates the above item as well), monogenes are "apparently" highly host-
specific for most cases, but once they are placed in a same aquarium, the barriers for
incorporation of new host lineages disappear completely! It would be interesting to revise the
concept of “faux specialist” (and others) of Brooks, D. R., & McLennan, D. A. (2012). The nature of
diversity: an evolutionary voyage of discovery. University of Chicago. Press.
3. Further, as mentioned by the previous referee: “The fact that eradicating (i.e. reducing
their global number of individuals to 0) disease of the previous referees has proved, in all cases
with (hopefully) the notable exception of dracunculiasis, should make us reflect about the
possibility that parasites may have more ways to survive extinctions than we think they have.”
From my research, they are more effective in incorporating new host species than we ever
considered, something that explains much of the Emergent Infectious Diseases outbreaks we are
observing these years.
4. All above, associated with the climate and environmental disruption we are facing,
suggest an increase in extinction rates but also an increase in “host-switching”. Thus, change is
expected – and includes extinctions, of course, but also host-range changes (hence, the expected
co-extinction will likely be smaller). Host-range variation should become more significant
especially because animal species are expected to change their range of distribution with change
in climate. Under this scenario, host and parasite species of distinct communities are likely to
come in contact, increasing the possibility of host-switching by “faux specialists”. And if host-
range change increases, diversification will likely follow. One of the most impressive examples of
the resilience of parasite species is seem in the marine-derived parasites that were capable of
accompanying the intensive colonization of marine-derived host species (mainly fishes) of
continental waters in South America. And this was independent of life cycle pattern, for instance!
Even lineages with complex life cycles were capable to successfully transferring into a completely
9
new community! That should tell us something! You may want to check: Malcicka, M., Agosta,
S. J., & Harvey, J. A. (2015). Multi level ecological fitting: indirect life cycles are not a barrier
to host switching and invasion.Global change biology, 21(9), 3210-3218.
5. Based on still-limited historical reconstructions, the overall change in diversification,
following environmental perturbations, should be immediately small, but should rapidly (in
geological time, of course), pick up. Thus, in the introduction or discussion, it would be
interesting to understand where you come from. I am sorry if I insist on this, but I don’t think
there would be a destruction of the host-parasite networks in a community but simply a
rearrangement. It seems to me that your concern with co-extinctions is associated to immediate
changes that may occur in the biological processes of a community. But, I guess, I am curious to
know to what extent do you think this is really significant for conservation. Avoid changes?
6. Despite an apparent divergence in our perspectives about conservation, I like the
analysis of possible traits associated with parasites vulnerability. However, it is, maybe, too late
to foment studies on a broad range of host-parasite associations but I would also suggest adding
experimental studies and historical analyses of associations. The first would allow testing
specific abilities of parasite lineages to survive by host-switching (using, real-time experiments or
natural experiments provided by invasive species, for instance). In fact, there are experimental
studies with some specific taxa already published (e.g. King, T. A., & Cable, J. (2007).
Experimental infections of the monogenean Gyrodactylus turnbulli indicate that it is not a strict
specialist. International Journal for Parasitology, 37(6), 663-672.).
Historical analyses should also provide important insights on the significance of the traits
suggested by the authors for “parasite vulnerability”/extinction.
But I do like the study and recommend that it should be published. Most of the comments above
are really food-for-thought! Use as desired ;-)

5. Line 49. “we argue that climate-driven parasite extinction and disease emergence are
complementary processes, as more virulent pathogens may experience competitive release as rare

The host specificity section also links host extinction and parasite extinction. In line 198 you even
say directly “Host susceptibility to primary extinction may thus be the best predictor of parasite

8. Lines 81-82. Acclimation is an individual level process and I don’t get how your
following section addresses acclimation at all
9. Line 88. I was totally confused to see “large” here since larger organisms are less
poikilotherimic and are less affected by ambient temperature fluctuations. Your later paragraph
on why large host body size could affect extinction risk as nothing to do with parasites being
buffered from ambient temperatures. Host largeness needs its own number here with its separate

10. Line 91. The “transmission” category needs to clearly say something about
environmental parasite life stages. It currently sounds limited to “biotic interaction”. This idea
needs to be introduced here so your reador doesn’t think you are overlooking something that you
acknowledge is likely the best predictor of the vulnerability of many parasite species to climate
change (line 143).
11. I completely did not understand the authors descriptions of temperature-immune
tradeoffs in homeotherms and poikilotherms (line 111-12). Do poikilotherms suffer reduced
immunity at high temperatures or just low ones? Don’t most poikilotherms behaviorally regulate
their temperatures and how much is this expected to shift with climate change? Its very
confusing to set this up, then have the most concrete example (source 32) contradict it entirely (its

fully explained and the scope of host/parasite systems studied acknowledged.
15. Line 171. “Finally” should start a new paragraph that should more fully explain the rest
of the sentence (and the scope of sources). I couldn’t find anything about generalist and
sensitivity to perturbation in source 48. The conclusion sentence was odd to me, particularly
given that you just mentioned that parasite generalism/specificity can vary by lifestage. This
critical idea needs to be followed up upon and related to risk of extinction (or why bother to
mention at all?)

16. Line 184. Here’s another one of those spots where the scope of hosts and parasites in this
literature needs to be mentioned.
17. Line 187. How can you start a paragraph with “consequently”? As a consequence of
what? This paragraph also discusses ectoparasites, which I thought were outside the scope of this
paper.
18. Line 198. Yes, host susceptibility to extinction is going to be critical, as is stated in many
(if not all) previous papers on this topic. I think your case would be stronger if you acknowledged
this idea first, then explained into how there are additional features that you are reviewing that
can contribute to this. It will make your paper sound more informed and novel, rather than
hiding the same old punchline at the end. (I felt this same sentiment when the enviromental
parasite lifestages came last in the previous section).
19. I thought the host range shifts section was stronger and more clearly written than the
other sections (even though ectoparasites (ticks) are used as the primary example (line 219).
However, I wasn’t quite convinced that lags in parasite dispersal will contribute to extinctions. I
think this is a point you need to clearly articulate and discuss with respect to uncertainty of how
long until extinction at old site vs. how long until movement to new site.
20. Line 248. Won’t hosts be moving to cooler more hospitable environments? If they stayed,
climate change would eventually cause it to be warmer and less hospitable, but isn’t that what
they are escaping by moving poleward/higher in elevation? Why would species move to hotter
locations? I also still don’t understand the temperature-immune thing (and its not cited here).
21. Line 252-254. Here’s another one of those spots where the scope of hosts and parasites in
this literature needs to be mentioned.
22. Line 265. The implications of the Lafferty study are unclear. What is “insurance” in this
context?
23. Line 277. I thought the whole point of this review was to find robust factors that could be
used to predict extinction risk, so then why say that critical knowledge gaps can only be
identified within “each field” (which fields?).
24. Line 283-284. Here’s another one of those spots where the scope of hosts and parasites in
this literature needs to be mentioned.
25. Line 285. Why are you talking about vector borne parasites? Why mention density
dependence here for the first time if its important? The (possibly very important) point you are
trying to make in the second half of this impossibly long sentence is lost.
26. Line 289-290. What is “minor decoupling”?
27. Lines 300-303. What taxa is this limited to? Only fish? What does it mean for parasite
extinction risk if clustering is only seen half the time and hot/cold spots are not predictable?
28. Figure 2 contains many terms not included in the paper: biotic pathway, abiotic
pathway, adaptive capacity, aggression, interspecific competition, and perhaps others. Its form
also does not match that of the paper. I do not see how it supports the paper or adds anything to
it.
29. Figure 3 is so confusing that its message is completely lost. I think the idea of a shrinking
hypervolume is easier to imagine than depict clearly.

The authors major work revising the manuscript make the paper much easier to read and their
logic and source use is much stronger. The new categories and reorganization enhance the work
significantly. I am very pleased with how the authors revised with respect to using a
macroparasite (and endoparasite) focus to raise questions and hypotheses that are applicable to
parasites at large. All my previous comments were addressed satisfactorily. I believe the paper is
very close to publication ready, but it still requires a few revisions before publication.
Line 131 – Prevalence comes out of no where to be listed as a predictor of extinction risk. If it is a
main predictor, then it should be listed with the 4 other predictors. If it is not a predictor, then it
should not be mentioned.
Line 161 – What are these mysterious “other traits”? Also, isn’t it a bit obvious to state that
poikilothermy can not be used as a trait for predicting parasite vulnerability within host clades
that are primarily poikilothermic? If the authors were trying to make a different point, they need
to make it more clear.
Host body size section – I have two major issues with the author’s citation use in this section.
Citation 44 studied parasite species richness, not diversity, and only in ungulates. Claiming it
shows that, “Larger hosts harbor a greater diversity of endoparasites” is untrue (even though
richness is a component of diversity, in a paragraph discussing rare species, richness, and
diversity, its not an acceptable mistake), and misleading since the study was only on a subset of
mammals. Correcting “diversity” to richness and qualifying that the study was on ungulates will
solve this issue.
Citation 45 studied only 23 species of mammals, but this critical information on the scope of hosts
does not appear. More importantly, it does not mention anything about larger species having
13
“more available niches” or “greater overall energetic reserves.” The cited study does test if larger
mammals (i.e. body size) is related to metabolism (BMR) and they found a positive relationship
between BMR and body mass - the opposite of what is stated in this paper, “lower proportional
metabolism.” This must be corrected. Maybe there is another reference for their claims that is
missing? The cited study also has interesting findings on the relationship between host density
and parasite richness that might have a place in this manuscript.
(only a suggestion) Temporal mismatch section (paragraph starting line 332) – A useful
experimental example of this type of temporal mismatch is the study by Paull and Johnson (2014).

mments to the Author(s)
authors attempted to make sense of a very complex subject for which we still have little supporting
a available. The subject is indeed very interesting but the complexity of the system inevitably
ulted in a somewhat subjective manuscript. However, although biased by the present level of
wledge on the ecology and evolution of associations, the attempt is valid and bring some insights
he problem posed. I am also not a fan of this perspective of bottom-up conservation nor I believe
conservation should be about the reduction of extinctions (especially if they are not catalyzed by
an activities). However, the manuscript indicates specific points to help us understand how
nts (hosts, parasites, environment/climate) integrate and generate unexpected patterns in higher
ls of complexity is indeed dependent in approaches like this one. With that in mind, I do have a few
ments that the authors may want to consider prior to final acceptance to publication (or even for
itional developments on the subject):
They have not explored the information on the past history of associations to postulate about
t extinctions (and diversification) and to understand the significance of the traits they
pose. There are many studies encompassing several groups of macro-parasites that can, I am sure,
vide a supporting perspective to the traits suggested by the authors. Ecological data provides
ted support to some of the points they discusses (e.g. phylogenetic conservatism of “extinction”
ential).
As most publications, the concept of specialists and generalist is far from being clear. This is
ecially important because some of their conclusions is based on these concepts. For instance (and
incorporates the above item as well), monogenes are "apparently" highly host-specific for most
es, but once they are placed in a same aquarium, the barriers for incorporation of new host lineages
ppear completely! It would be interesting to revise the concept of “faux specialist” (and others) of

versity of Chicago. Press.
Further, as mentioned by the previous referee: “The fact that eradicating (i.e. reducing their global
ber of individuals to 0) disease of the previous referees has proved, in all cases with (hopefully)
notable exception of dracunculiasis, should make us reflect about the possibility that parasites may
e more ways to survive extinctions than we think they have.” From my research, they are more
ctive in incorporating new host species than we ever considered, something that explains much of
Emergent Infectious Diseases outbreaks we are observing these years.
All above, associated with the climate and environmental disruption we are facing, suggest an
ease in extinction rates but also an increase in “host-switching”. Thus, change is expected – and
udes extinctions, of course, but also host-range changes (hence, the expected co-extinction will
ly be smaller). Host-range variation should become more significant especially because animal
cies are expected to change their range of distribution with change in climate. Under this scenario,
t and parasite species of distinct communities are likely to come in contact, increasing the
sibility of host-switching by “faux specialists”. And if host-range change increases, diversification
likely follow. One of the most impressive examples of the resilience of parasite species is seem in
marine-derived parasites that were capable of accompanying the intensive colonization of marine-
ved host species (mainly fishes) of continental waters in South America. And this was independent
fe cycle pattern, for instance! Even lineages with complex life cycles were capable to successfully
sferring into a completely new community! That should tell us something! You may want to check:
cicka, M., Agosta, S. J., & Harvey, J. A. (2015). Multi level ecological fitting: indirect life cycles are
a barrier to host switching and invasion. Global change biology, 21(9), 3210-3218.
Based on still-limited historical reconstructions, the overall change in diversification, following
ironmental perturbations, should be immediately small, but should rapidly (in geological time, of
rse), pick up. Thus, in the introduction or discussion, it would be interesting to understand where
come from. I am sorry if I insist on this, but I don’t think there would be a destruction of the host-
asite networks in a community but simply a rearrangement. It seems to me that your concern with
extinctions is associated to immediate changes that may occur in the biological processes of a
munity. But, I guess, I am curious to know to what extent do you think this is really significant for
servation. Avoid changes?
Despite an apparent divergence in our perspectives about conservation, I like the analysis of
sible traits associated with parasites vulnerability. However, it is, maybe, too late to foment studies
a broad range of host-parasite associations but I would also suggest adding experimental studies
historical analyses of associations. The first would allow testing specific abilities of parasite
ages to survive by host-switching (using, real-time experiments or natural experiments provided by
sive species, for instance). In fact, there are experimental studies with some specific taxa already
lished (e.g. King, T. A., & Cable, J. (2007). Experimental infections of the monogenean Gyrodactylus
bulli indicate that it is not a strict specialist. International Journal for Parasitology, 37(6), 663-672.).
orical analyses should also provide important insights on the significance of the traits suggested
he authors for “parasite vulnerability”/extinction.
I do like the study and recommend that it should be published. Most of the comments above are
ly food-for-thought! Use as desired ;-)
would like to thank Reviewer #1 for this detailed response to the points we raise in this manuscript.
ve made changes throughout that incorporate many of these ideas, and have added roughly a page of text
e end of our host specificity section that explores the Stockholm paradigm, ecological fitting, the
sibilities of host switching, and the challenges therein. We’ve also thoroughly updated text throughout
ted to this issue, including a rewritten paragraph about the evolutionary problems associated with host
ching in “specialists”.
have, however, not covered all the ground this reviewer has recommended. We are particularly excited
ut the fact that reviews are published alongside our manuscript because, in a draft that is somehow already
r 9000 words (much longer than when we started!), it would be incredibly challenging to continue adding
, in particular, to walk through historical evolutionary evidence for shifts (things that are better covered by
r publications, e.g. “Phylogeny, ecological fitting and lung flukes: helping solve the problem of emerging
ctious diseases”). Fortunately, the ideas reviewer #1 brings up won’t be lost entirely, and we’ve tried to
t to studies considering these points in greater depth in the Host Specificity section. We believe our section

rporate them in a follow-up manuscript currently in preparation.
reference, updated passages in our host specificity section:
ally, specialist parasites require an evolutionary host switch to colonize a new host, whereas generalist
sites by definition have already crossed multiple host-species barriers [60]; host switching is time costly,
rapidity dependent on factors such as host group size and host and parasite spatial overlap [61]. Other
ies have found that host switching may not be the primary factor determining parasite extinction, and that
eralist parasites may be less vulnerable than specialists by resisting extinction in other ways such as
ving more quickly to avoid host immune defenses [62].
framework for parasite extinction risk based on specialism also has to acknowledge that parasites that can
pt to novel hosts, or expand geographically into regions with stable hosts, will be far less prone to
xtinction (e.g., [69]). In some ecosystems and under certain climatic conditions, due to the limited
lability of certain hosts or competitive exclusion by other parasites [70], some parasites may appear as
tional specialists or "faux specialists" [71]. When faux specialists encounter changing environments in their
ve range or novel environments when their ranges shift, species with the necessary potential for adaptation
ergo a process of host-switching that the "Stockholm paradigm" of parasitology terms ecological fitting. That
ess, according to Malcicka et al., relies on a combination of three baseline processes: phenotypic plasticity
enetically-coded traits, correlated trait integration which allows rapid multidimensional phenotypic shifts,
phylogenetic conservatism of traits that offer "latent potential" [72]. Together these engender an untapped
ntial for persistence in "sloppy fitness space" after host extinction, or after misalignment of phenology or
ribution between hosts and parasites.
Stockholm paradigm, and theories of ecological fitting, suggest a glimmer hope for some parasites [73]
casts doubt on the relative predictive power of coextinction models). In the evolutionary long term, climate
nge could drive diversification; some authors have argued the staggering diversity of parasites worldwide
have been facilitated by climate-driven periods of intense host switching [74], and experimental [75] and
orical [76] evidence further supports that these processes have dramatic effects on the persistence of
sites in unlikely environments. Moreover, as some parasites do poorly, their absence may trigger
petitive release in others, enabling a once-excluded species to exhibit plasticity and dominate under novel
ditions in a given host species [77]. In the works of Hoberg and Brooks, the process of ecological fitting is
rpreted as a driving factor not just in the production of a host-parasite coevolutionary geographic matrix, but
in the emergence of human and wildlife infectious diseases. But they similarly acknowledge that ecological
g is not without constraints; long-term evolutionary recovery may still be matched by short-term decreases
versity (i.e. many species are still likely to face some threat of extinction). We further note that the
recedented velocity of current climatic change may make ecological fitting an ineffective silver bullet for
gating short-term extinction risks in more species than usual, especially considering the limited success
ping pace with climate change that most free-living species are already projected to have (see Figure 4-5 in
). In light of this evidence, coextinction estimates based on binary host-parasite association matrices could
erhaps replaced by more informed predictive approaches that anticipate host switching. Host switching and
site diversification occur more often within definitive hosts of the same guild than among hosts of different
ds [70], and are less likely if no closely-related hosts occur in the parasite’s geographic range or host
era are species-poor [79]. Merging geographic and phylogenetic data may offer a better perspective on the
nction risk of different species in groups of conservation interest.”

mments to the Author(s)
le I found the authors topic to be one of broad interest and clearly warranting a review, I found their
er extremely difficult to follow and have major issues with some of their logic, examples, and
rce use. I have misgivings when I find two incorrectly cited sources in a paper (21 & 48), but I don’t
e time to fact-check every source. I ask the authors to carefully review every one of their sources
ing this revision.
I second the previous reviewer #1’s comment of “I think the paper would gain from a more
erentiated consideration of "extinction" (time- and spacewise more differentiated definitions)”. P2
17 states “54% of species facing extinction”, but by when? Surely not the 15 years mentioned in
second half of that statement?
source on the 54% figure is Urban’s 2015 review in Science, which indicates that that figure applies to an
finite interval. The “15 years” in the second half of the statement was meant as a retrospect on the climate
nge ecology literature that began around the turn of the century, not an extinction statistic. The updated
tence reads, “With estimates of up to 54% of free-living species eventually committed to extinction, the fate
arasites remains uncertain, despite significant research profiling climate-driven biodiversity loss since the
of the century.”
On P3 line 22 you state that you focus on “macroscopic endoparasites”, but then the literature
cite in that same paragraph is not limited to that parasite ‘group’. You also never state how
mon such parasite are nor what are their “other life history attributes” that make them “uniquely
sitive”, nor do you compare them with microscopic or ectoparasites to validate such claims.
oughout the manuscript you use ticks and mosquitoes as examples, despite the fact they are not
roscopic endoparasites. Throughout the paper it is unclear when you are restricting your
ements to your focal group or talking about parasites in general, this must be fixed.
cifying endoparasites was an error in the original paper – this line now reads “Macroparasites, which we
s on here, are uniquely sensitive to climate-induced…” The organizational issue underlying the sentence
also been addressed, as text from the third paragraph (which discusses coextinction), has been moved up
atch this topic sentence, and reorganized entirely so that the second paragraph explains the importance of
ate change and parasite extinctions while the third paragraph discusses the ecosystem consequences of
process.
Overall, more clear use of sources would be appreciated. Grand statements are made without any
cription of how broadly or narrowly such patterns have actually be observed in nature./
ve updated sources throughout, paying close attention to phrasing that specifies in which systems any
icular phenomenon has been observed (and we note many in our below responses); but we also note that
purpose of this paper is to tie together disparate threads and make predictions that are overarching,
eralized, and testable. We feel a recent review of the role of predictions in ecology makes an excellent
t: “A hallmark of ecological research is that we test coarse hypotheses that have relatively low information
tent.” We’ve also further integrated that idea into the text explicitly at the end of the introduction in a way
we believe responds to most of reviewer #2’s comments about the incredible diversity of parasites:
his review, we highlight the aspects of parasite biology that make this (polyphyletic) category of organisms
icularly vulnerable to extinction resulting from climate change, and identify biological traits of parasite
cies that may act as important predictors of different outcomes under climate change (summarized in Figure
Those hypotheses are loosely focused on helminth endoparasites, but are also readily applicable in many
es to other parasitic groups (e.g., in discussions of host specificity or free-living stages). Many of our results
e from theoretical work (which is often applicable across different forms of parasitism) or generalized
erns in the literature, and has enabled us to identify what we believe are testable and falsifiable
otheses. As Houlahan notes in a recent and incredibly valuable review of the role of prediction in ecology,
allmark of ecological research is that we test coarse hypotheses that have relatively low information
tent" [33]. With the relationship between climate change and the many aspects of parasite biology we cover
often unexplored for various clades, we focus on these generalized, testable hypotheses, which can be
ed and tailored to the incredible diversity of parasitic life on earth. We also outright acknowledge the
sive data deficiencies characterizing many parasite species and clades. Thus, in addition to our framework,
devote the final section of our paper to identifying the major missing links within each discipline that are
ded to build an interdisciplinary parasite conservation toolbox.”
Line 44 – source 21. Please reread the source, this is not a clam that paper makes (nor even a
c it covers).
have taken out “at an ecosystem scale” and retooled the phrasing to “within-host interactions and
petition between parasites can dilute disease risk for hosts in counter-intuitive ways”. This is definitely what
referenced paper, “Host and parasite diversity jointly control disease risk in complex communities”, is about
st richness and parasite richness both dilute virulent Riberoia infections, and the process of coinfection that
es this (we have also added another Johnson citation to: “Parasite diversity and coinfection determine
ogen infection success and host fitness”) is fundamentally a process that scales between within-host and
system processes. Johnson’s paper even discusses this: “Parasite diversity is not equivalent to disease
given that many parasitic species cause relatively little harm to the host under normal conditions, disease
is better equated to the abundance or prevalence of the most virulent parasites, rather than the overall
ness of parasites per se (5, 19). Increases in parasite diversity may even function to reduce transmission if
sites are antagonistic with one another within hosts (19<U+21D3><U+21D3>–22).”
Line 49. “we argue that climate-driven parasite extinction and disease emergence are
plementary processes, as more virulent pathogens may experience competitive release as rare
cies go extinct”. You need sources to back up your bold clam. Couldn’t low host population
/density select for less virulent parasites?
We’ve removed this source at this location and tightened the phrasing a great deal in this section.
three relevant sentences now read: “Recent research has also highlighted that within-host processes can
e disease risk at the ecosystem scale in counter-intuitive ways. As demonstrated in the Ribeiroia
atode-amphibian experimental system, parasite and host biodiversity can both dilute disease risk and
site-induced host mortality at the population level. Just as decreasing diversity in free-living species often
eases the dominance of the most abundant species, parasite extinctions could have unpredictable effects
he structure of disease communities, as some pathogens could experience competitive release as rare
cies go extinct.”
Line 60. Does 7% refer to invertebrates or parasites?
mals in general; however, the broader significance of that number is now more clearly explained:
2015, the IUCN estimates that less than 0.1% of contemporary animal species have already gone extinct,
accounting for poorly-documented groups that figure is likely closer to 7%.”
Line 64. Why is it important to focus on parasite traits independent of their host’s risk? If most
asite extinction risk is linked with host declines/extinctions, wouldn’t it be more prudent to focus on
t host-parasite consercation strategies. Why does focusing on just this subclass of parasite-only
nction risks make them more robust and applicable across parasite groups? This idea is
icularly confusing given that you go on to say (lines 135-140) that large host body size is an
nction risk for parasites because large hosts have higher extinction risk. The host specificity
tion also links host extinction and parasite extinction. In line 198 you even say directly “Host
ceptibility to primary extinction may thus be the best predictor of parasite extinction risk”. This
ctly contradicts what you are setting up in line 64.
ve worked to make this idea much clearer in some places. In particular, we’ve added a new paragraph to
introduction, with a set of new references, explaining this in greater detail. It reads:
en parasites are considered in the climate change literature, the majority of studies focus on virulent
ogens that could become dominant in a changing climate, raising human health concerns [6,7,8]; but the
ority of parasites have no direct effect on human health, and the potential negative impacts of climate
nge on most wildlife parasites are, by and large, empirically untested. Macroparasites, which we focus on
, are already uniquely sensitive to secondary extinctions; theoretical work suggests that parasite
erability may be ten times higher than the baseline extinction rate of their hosts due to the diversity of
sites relative to their hosts and the high potential for secondary and tertiary extinctions [9]. Consequently,
high extinction rate vertebrates face under climate change should be matched by an accompanying mass
xtinction, but that phenomenon that is poorly documented at best [10].”
ilarly, the section on host specificity has been reworked and expanded from the suggestions of reviewer #1.
at updated section, we’ve removed that statement; we believe that it is perhaps misleading and instead
lain some of the reasons that “coextinction is only a fraction of the total vulnerability parasites face”, which
s into a whole new paragraph explaining the direct mechanisms of parasite vulnerability to climate change.
Lines 81-82. Acclimation is an individual level process and I don’t get how your following section
resses acclimation at all
limation was poor word choice; the “through adaptation and acclimation” phrase has been cut on that line,
later, a phrase that said acclimation has been updated to read, “the relationship between host and parasite
mal ecology is complicated by…”
Line 88. I was totally confused to see “large” here since larger organisms are less poikilotherimic
are less affected by ambient temperature fluctuations. Your later paragraph on why large host
y size could affect extinction risk as nothing to do with parasites being buffered from ambient
peratures. Host largeness needs its own number here with its separate reasons outlined.
ve split these sections as the reviewer has suggested, bringing the total number of predictors we suggest to
. The first two now read,
Metabolic ecology: Parasites less buffered from unpredictable ambient temperature fluctuations by
ilothermic hosts will, with some exceptions, be the most vulnerable.
ost body size: Parasites of larger hosts will be more vulnerable to extinction due to increased coextinction
and the subsequent loss of a large number of parasite niches and parasite diversity.”
hermore, these sections are now split into four sections in the main text, with body size as its own category
Line 91. The “transmission” category needs to clearly say something about environmental
asite life stages. It currently sounds limited to “biotic interaction”. This idea needs to be introduced
e so your reador doesn’t think you are overlooking something that you acknowledge is likely the
t predictor of the vulnerability of many parasite species to climate change (line 143).
ve renamed this category “Transmission and persistence” and the updated description reads “Each
pendent stage in a parasite life cycle, either in different hosts or free-living stages, can be characterized by
wn ecological niche; the overlap among them can become spatially or phenologically disjunct,
pounding vulnerability”
I completely did not understand the authors descriptions of temperature-immune tradeoffs in
eotherms and poikilotherms (line 111-12). Do poikilotherms suffer reduced immunity at high
peratures or just low ones? Don’t most poikilotherms behaviorally regulate their temperatures and
much is this expected to shift with climate change? Its very confusing to set this up, then have the
st concrete example (source 32) contradict it entirely (its not warming but “unpredictiable
perature change” that has larger effects on immunity to chytrid). Its also very odd to end this
tion saying that body size is probably a bigger driver, before you explain why host body size is a
er of extinction risk.
Line 115-117. “However, the availability of such resources may be beneficial for parasites,
ing to many examples of the fittest individuals harboring the highest parasitic burdens.” What does
sentence mean, what is the source, and what are the “resources” being referred to?
agree that this paragraph was rather complicated, especially due to a number of previous reviews that
nged the structure around somewhat. We’ve returned to an older conceptual organization that we believe
much more straightforward, better explains the tradeoffs poikilotherms face, and then specifies what
ources” are being referred to. Finally, instead of switching the order of metabolic ecology and body size
ch are ordered as a logical progression: before proxy traits, we explore the direct sensitivity of parasites to
perature), we’ve simply edited the body size bit out of the end. It now reads:
e relationship between host and parasite thermal ecology is complicated by tradeoffs between host
ptation and immunity, which varies directly with both body size and form of thermal homeostasis (i.e.,
eothermy vs. poikilothermy). Parasites in homeothermic hosts may benefit from external temperature
uations; homeotherms may expend more energy to maintain internal temperature within the optimal part of
r performance curves, limiting their immune resource expenditure for anti-parasite defenses and reactions
39]. Conversely, parasites of poikilothermic hosts may be more vulnerable to fluctuating temperatures (see
re S1), because poikilothermic internal temperature changes widely with environmental temperature, but
volutionary processes may already drive a matching degree of eurythermality between hosts and parasites.
ever, as illustrated by experiments on antimicrobial responses to chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium
drobatidis), unpredictable temperature changes may compromise host immunity far more severely than
-term warming trends [40], and this would likely ultimately be to the benefit of parasites in poikilothermic
ts. Thus, the higher extinction rate that poikilothermic vertebrates like reptiles and amphibians are generally
umed to face may not be matched by primary extinction risk for parasites, suggesting other traits may be
er within-clade predictors of parasite vulnerability.”
Line 128. Larger INDIVIDUALS or SPECIES? Larger species also tend to have lower mass-specific
abolic rates, larger energy stores, and greater capacity to withstand temporary food shortages.
ely these factors are worth mentioning?
is case, larger species (text updated to clarify). We’ve further added these points to the first sentence of
paragraph, as they are in support of the point we make there: larger hosts are a more stable habitat overall.
t opening sentence now reads: “Larger hosts harbor a greater diversity of endoparasites [44], as they have
e available niches, tend to have longer lifespans, and have a combination of metabolic traits (lower
ortional metabolism, and greater overall energetic reserves, make them less dependent on steady and
stant food availability), that together make them a potentially more stable, long-term parasite habitat [45].”
Line 132-134. “higher host specificity [29], a trait already associated with the higher proportional
ness due to the asymmetric nature of host-parasite webs”. This needs to be more fully explained
the scope of host/parasite systems studied acknowledged.
oughout this paragraph “parasite” is changed to “endoparasite” to clarify the focus (and acknowledge the
repancy from other host/parasite systems). The expanded text, with three new references, now reads: “The
e stable internal environment of larger hosts also supports higher host specificity [36], a trait already
ociated with the higher proportional richness due to the asymmetric nature of host-parasite webs (i.e.
cialist parasites favor hosts with greater parasite diversity, a finding that is similarly robust in plant-pollinator
other association networks) [47]. Consequently, evidence suggests larger hosts are likely to host a greater
rall richness of more specialized endoparasites, a finding confirmed across different groups, e.g. metazoan
sites of carnivores [48] and fish [49]. Though some individual studies on ectoparasites like fleas have
etimes failed to find the same pattern (e.g. [50]), other studies including all parasites of mammals, including
oparasites like viruses, found a similar body size-richness scaling pattern [51]. While large vertebrate hosts
hold the majority of parasite diversity.”
Line 171. “Finally” should start a new paragraph that should more fully explain the rest of the
tence (and the scope of sources). I couldn’t find anything about generalist and sensitivity to
urbation in source 48. The conclusion sentence was odd to me, particularly given that you just
ntioned that parasite generalism/specificity can vary by lifestage. This critical idea needs to be
owed up upon and related to risk of extinction (or why bother to mention at all?)
paragraph was definitely in need of reorganization, and the ideas we explained in terms of
eralism/specificity were both unclear and too complex in terms of variation by parasite group. That
tion is now rewritten to go into greater depth about the actual mechanics of host switching, and reads:
ally, specialist parasites require an evolutionary host switch to colonize a new host, whereas
eralist parasites by definition have already crossed multiple host-species barriers [60]; host switching
me costly, with rapidity dependent on factors such as host group size and host and parasite spatial
rlap [61]. Other studies have found that host switching may not be the primary factor determining
asite extinction, and that generalist parasites may be less vulnerable than specialists by resisting
nction in other ways such as evolving more quickly to avoid host immune defenses [62].”

ature needs to be mentioned.

minths).
Line 198. Yes, host susceptibility to extinction is going to be critical, as is stated in many (if not
previous papers on this topic. I think your case would be stronger if you acknowledged this idea

vious section).
ve made several revisions at the start of the paper that explain why coextinction isn’t a silver bullet for
iction; see our response to #7. Similarly, this entire section has been thoroughly expanded with the help of
iewer #1. One key point they raise is, because of processes of ecological fitting, parasites’ vulnerability will
n decouple from host extinctions – making other factors better predictors. We conclude our section now
something new and not previously mentioned in the literature: the idea that using predictive statistical
hods can illuminate the hidden plasticity/potential host switching of some parasites, and in combination with
graphic data, can be a new and more effective method of actually assessing parasites’ vulnerability as a
tion of host switching potential.
I thought the host range shifts section was stronger and more clearly written than the other
tions (even though ectoparasites (ticks) are used as the primary example (line 219). However, I
n’t quite convinced that lags in parasite dispersal will contribute to extinctions. I think this is a
nt you need to clearly articulate and discuss with respect to uncertainty of how long until extinction
ld site vs. how long until movement to new site.
direct this comment to paragraph two of this section, which does discuss the time over which parasites are
able of shifting alongside hosts (and the associated challenges they face). We’ve also added a sentence at
end of the section alluding to a manuscript currently in review, which identified a 1-in-10 direct risk of
nction facing parasites from climate change driven habitat loss (the data is already available online).
Line 248. Won’t hosts be moving to cooler more hospitable environments? If they stayed, climate
nge would eventually cause it to be warmer and less hospitable, but isn’t that what they are
aping by moving poleward/higher in elevation? Why would species move to hotter locations? I also
don’t understand the temperature-immune thing (and its not cited here).
reviewer is correct that hosts would migrate, if possible, to cooler environments. We have clarified our
othetical example to make it clear that we are examining a host-parasite combination that experiences a
ming environment, without migratory escape (for simplicity) – “move” was an unfortunate phrasing that
’t convey that. We have also added citations as available. However, as we state at the beginning of the
graph, this example is purely hypothetical and based on the limited literature examining these issues
arately; to our knowledge, there have been no studies examining host immunity and parasite colonization
nges in conjunction with a warming environment. It is this lack of research that our manuscript is expressly
sed on. This section now reads:
, as hosts experience warmer, more-inhospitable environments, their immune resistance may be lowered
, and while parasite free-living stages may also lose niche space [41,42], their hosts may support a higher
rall level of infection in that smaller range. This may provide a net benefit to parasites, especially those with
evolutionary ability to bypass dependence on intermediate stages.”

Line 265. The implications of the Lafferty study are unclear. What is “insurance” in this context?
have changed the phrasing here to make clearer the implications of the Lafferty study – namely, that
plex life cycles are a much greater contributor to extinction risk than host specificity. That passage now
s: “In fact, by simulating the sequential and random extinction of every component of both theoretical and
irical food webs, Lafferty [56] found that increasing the number of life cycle stages by one in a model
em negated the added robustness to extinction that would be provided by an additional 12 suitable hosts,
lighting that complex life cycles have a much more readily noticed effect on extinction risk than host
cificity.”
Line 277. I thought the whole point of this review was to find robust factors that could be used to
dict extinction risk, so then why say that critical knowledge gaps can only be identified within “each
d” (which fields?).
ve clarified the sentence immediately before “Predictors of Parasite Vulnerability” that previously read
hin that framework, we identify the major missing links needed to build an interdisciplinary parasite
servation toolbox” to now more clearly articulate this point: “We also outright acknowledge the massive data
ciencies characterizing many parasite species and clades; and so, in addition to our framework, we identify
major missing links within each discipline that are needed to build an interdisciplinary parasite conservation
box.”

ond half of this impossibly long sentence is lost.
have returned to a phrasing from previous drafts, which we believed was much clearer and involved vector
e parasites in a much clearer fashion, which reads:
pulation viability analysis is one of the most important items in the climate change biologist’s toolbox [88],
for parasitic species, both within-host density and host density thresholds may exist that predict population
istence [29]. However, the host population dynamics needed to maintain parasite species in the face of
ronmental change are not well understood. While a number of vector-borne parasites have strong density-
en vector-parasite associations (e.g. [89], not all parasite population dynamics are as easily predicted by
of their hosts. Wood et al. [90] found that marine parasites with long free-living larval stages could disperse
e widely and were thus less affected by nearby host density, suggesting that parasites with broader host
es and/or the ability to disperse farther may have transmission rates that are less tightly coupled to host
sity. However, to our knowledge, no studies have examined the interaction between spatiotemporal
ersion, host density, and transmission rates for parasites on land. It would not be surprising to find similar
cts, however, given the fact that these larvae on land (e.g. helminth larvae) travel short distances and
ive for only one to two weeks during their free-living development [91].”

phrasing has been updated to make the connection to the previous sentence clearer, and now reads

ence was found across mammals, birds, and fish. We more clearly articulate that point, as well as the fact
variability in hotspots may not actually change overall extinction rates, but determines the situational
vance of that type of data in predicting parasite extinction. The updated text reads:
ulin et al. [92] found some evidence of phylogenetic clustering of host-parasite “hotspots” (host taxa capable
upporting a diverse array of parasite species) and “coldspots” (host taxa relatively depauperate in parasite
cies richness) for mammalian, bird, and fish hosts. These types of non-random patterns of diversity will
ately determine the situational relevance of phylogenetic data and methods to the prediction of extinction

have updated the figure to only include only phrases included in, and relevant to, the paper, and to make

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_7
Line 131 – Prevalence comes out of no where to be listed as a predictor of extinction risk. If
it is a main predictor, then it should be listed with the 4 other predictors. If it is not a
predictor, then it should not be mentioned.
We have removed this mention of prevalence.
Line 161 – What are these mysterious “other traits”? Also, isn’t it a bit obvious to state that
poikilothermy can not be used as a trait for predicting parasite vulnerability within host
clades that are primarily poikilothermic? If the authors were trying to make a different
point, they need to make it more clear.
We are here referring to the other three sets of traits that we discuss below. Also, reviewer 2
misinterprets our point, which is that the parasites of reptiles and amphibians may not directly be
more vulnerable than those of homeothermic groups (a between-clade comparison, not within)
and we’ve changed “suggested” to “and” to clarify the other traits in question are relevant to
identifying the most vulnerable reptile and amphibian parasites. This passage now reads, “…, and
other traits (like the ones we describe in other sections below) will be more suitable within-clade
predictors of parasite vulnerability.”
Host body size section – I have two major issues with the author’s citation use in this
section.
Citation 44 studied parasite species richness, not diversity, and only in ungulates. Claiming
it shows that, “Larger hosts harbor a greater diversity of endoparasites” is untrue (even
though richness is a component of diversity, in a paragraph discussing rare species,
richness, and diversity, its not an acceptable mistake), and misleading since the study was
only on a subset of mammals. Correcting “diversity” to richness and qualifying that the
study was on ungulates will solve this issue.
We have changed the word “diversity” to “richness”, and clarified so this now reads “Larger
hosts often harbor a greater richness of endoparasites (as shown by some work in ungulates
[44])”.
Citation 45 studied only 23 species of mammals, but this critical information on the scope of
hosts does not appear. More importantly, it does not mention anything about larger species
having “more available niches” or “greater overall energetic reserves.” The cited study does
test if larger mammals (i.e. body size) is related to metabolism (BMR) and they found a
positive relationship between BMR and body mass - the opposite of what is stated in this
paper, “lower proportional metabolism.” This must be corrected. Maybe there is another
reference for their claims that is missing? The cited study also has interesting findings on
the relationship between host density and parasite richness that might have a place in this
manuscript.
We’ve changed this sentence back (it was originally changed to reflect these ideas due to a
reviewer comment) and updated to a citation that includes all these ideas (including available
niche space); it now reads “Larger hosts often harbor a greater richness of endoparasites (as
shown by some work in ungulates [44]), as they have more available niches, tend to have longer
lifespans, and have metabolic traits (e.g. greater overall energetic reserves that support the high
cost of maintaining more parasites and that make them less dependent on steady and constant
food availability), that together make them a potentially more stable, long-term parasite habitat.
