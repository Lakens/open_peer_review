Comments on Manuscript RSOS-170503
This paper is primarily an experimental study that reproduces some previously reported
observations related to the Rose Window Instability (RWI). I believe the thermal gradient results
are new.
The experiments were carefully carried out although not all details are well described. Also many
of the explanations are unclear. In particular the author does not seem to really understand the
characteristics of the corona discharge. This is very important as it is the source of the driving
mechanism, the ion layer. I suggest that revisions are required.
Following are some areas that I have difficulty with and need clarification.
1) The power supply used was a 0-10kV DC unit stated as capable of being pulsed between
50-500 kHz. Nowhere does the author report what pulse frequency was used and/or why a
specific value was selected? This will have a major effect on the V-I characteristic.(Fig 11)
2) How was the current measured? No instrument is listed. This is not trivial in pulsed
corona.
3) The author shows lack of knowledge about the fundamentals of the corona discharge.
For example the fact that there is no current detected before the threshold voltage is due to the
nature of corona. The author ascribes the resulting current flow to the ion buildup on the oil
surface and subsequent “dielectric breakdown” due to the thinning of the oil layer. I see no
evidence to suggest breakdown actually occurs, ion migration is a more likely explanation.
4) Further to this, the statement “before the instability initiates, we measure zero current at
the grounded electrode” is used to imply no “breakdown” of the oil film occurs at these lower
voltages. The reason (unstated in the paper) is that no corona forms at the lower voltages and
hence no ions accumulate.
5) The suggestion that the linear dependence on voltage is because E=V/L is not true in the
non linear field found in corona. It is true that this may approximate the result over small ranges
but again it neglects the fact that the field gradient near the tip is primarily driven by the tip
radius and not the value of L. At the very least I would expect the author to show this
dependency and then argue why the limit applies.
6) In Fig 11 the author should clarify cause and effect. He states that no current flows before
the threshold voltage of RWI is reached. This threshold voltage marks the onset of corona, hence
the ion buildup on the oil and the initiation of RWI. In this context the author’s conclusion that
ions are the cause of the instability is trivial and not new.
7) I could not follow the argument for Fig 12 and am not convinced it is correct.
8) Most of the results reported are confirmation of those previously observed by other
authors. The new data that relates to the thermal gradient is interesting but results for only two
instants of time are reported. In my opinion more data should have been presented and this
section expanded.
9) There are many places in the text where inappropriate words are used and should be
caught by a careful editing; eg “lay bare”, “cement”, “stiffening”, “cell” vs “bead” etc.

Report on “The electric honeycomb; an investigation of the Rose Window
instability
By Muhammad Shaheer Niazi
This paper presents an experimental research on the Rose Window instability induced by
corona discharge in a point-to-plate geometry. The author reports measurements of the
instability threshold as a function of the point height or the liquid layer thickness. Also the
variation of the cell size with voltage and a measurement of temperature distribution on the
liquid surface are considered. As a whole the paper is interesting as an experimental study and
I am favorable to its publication in “Royal Society Open Science”. However, there are several
points that deserve the author attention prior to publication. These are:
<U+F0B7> In page 6, lines 11 to 15 the author discusses how the presence of objects block the
path of ions towards the surface of the oil. As a consequence, the instability
disappears. But this fact is not due only to the block of ions path, but also to the block
of the electric field itself. This is evident in the case of metals, and can be the case for
insulating materials, like a sheet of paper, if they become charged as a result of the ion
flow. To be specific, the fact that the presence of obstacles inhibit the instability does
not prove that it is due to the ion flow. (Although we have other reasons to think that
this is the case)
<U+F0B7> I think that the threshold found in the current-voltage characteristic shown in figure 11
is the corona discharge threshold, and not the instability threshold. The influence of
the convection on the current is too small to be observed. The author can test this fact
making a current-voltage characteristic without liquid layer.
<U+F0B7> In page 8 lines 6 to 12 it is said that the Benard instability occurs because the heat
energy absorbed by the oil exceeds the amount dissipated, and something similar
happens in the Rose-window instability. The author concludes that the instability
stabilizes the system. Also, in the caption of figure 12 it is said “to maintain equilibrium
in the medium”. These expressions are not rigorously right. It is right to say that the
flow augments the heat or the current transfer, but the situation is not of equilibrium
neither before nor after the instability appears, and there is always a balance between
the energy provided and the energy dissipated if a steady state is reached.

The author shows lack of knowledge about the fundamentals of the corona discharge. For example the
that there is no current detected before the threshold voltage is due to the nature of corona. The author
ibes the resulting current flow to the ion buildup on the oil surface and subsequent “dielectric breakdown”
to the thinning of the oil layer. I see no evidence to suggest breakdown actually occurs, ion migration is a
e likely explanation.
sponse from author:
ve tried best to make things in my paper understandable even by the lay man. For simplicity in
erstanding, I have said, that “one can visualize” the phenomena as dielectric breakdown. The onset of
ona is also the onset of the instability.
urther to this, the statement “before the instability initiates, we measure zero current at the grounded
trode” is used to imply no “breakdown” of the oil film occurs at these lower voltages. The reason (unstated
e paper) is that no corona forms at the lower voltages and hence no ions accumulate.
sponse from author:
nk you for pointing this out, I have corrected it.
The suggestion that the linear dependence on voltage is because E=V/L is not true in the non linear field
d in corona. It is true that this may approximate the result over small ranges but again it neglects the fact
the field gradient near the tip is primarily driven by the tip radius and not the value of L. At the very least I
ld expect the author to show this dependency and then argue why the limit applies.
sponse from author:
ve not called E=V/L but E~V/L as we aren’t very close to the tip of the pin. The electric field can be
umed as parallel near the grounded plate at this voltage range and on the instability region in question
he ratios in pin height and instability radius aren’t that large, so we can assume a homogenous field in
instability region. I have included a few lines explaining this.
In Fig 11 the author should clarify cause and effect. He states that no current flows before the threshold
age of RWI is reached. This threshold voltage marks the onset of corona, hence the ion buildup on the oil
the initiation of RWI. In this context the author’s conclusion that ions are the cause of the instability is trivial
not new.
sponse from author:
spite not being new, I have simplified the process of replicating the experiment and further
ngthened the role of ions in the little known phenomena. Nevertheless I have included a few
s in the conclusion highlighting the new perspectives to the phenomena, namely thermal and
lieren.
I could not follow the argument for Fig 12 and am not convinced it is correct.
sponse from author:
to suggestioins from many reviewers, I have removed this figure and replaced it with freshly taken
lieren photographs of the air gap between the oil and needle.
Most of the results reported are confirmation of those previously observed by other authors. The new
that relates to the thermal gradient is interesting but results for only two instants of time are reported. In
opinion more data should have been presented and this section expanded.
sponse from author:
ve added 2 more instants of time, the start of instability and half a minute into it. After 5 minutes there
o further increase in temperature. I have also performed schlieren photography of the air gap between
needle point and the ground electrode to image the corona streamer and resulting gas flow.
There are many places in the text where inappropriate words are used and should be caught by a careful

sponse from Author:
nk you for your review! Yes I agree, but the very interesting thing was how due to the
ckage the rest of the instability profile remains unchanged and retains its size etc, if charged
ould disrupt the profile of the instability which is unshielded as well.
hink that the threshold found in the current-voltage characteristic shown in figure 11
he corona discharge threshold, and not the instability threshold. The influence of the
vection on the current is too small to be observed. The author can test this fact
king a current-voltage characteristic without liquid layer.
sponse from Author:
instability and corona are undoubtedly related in this phenomena. The jump in current from
to some finite value starts exactly as the dimple forms, which marks the start of the
ability, thus the reason of calling it instability threshold. I have edited the caption of figure 11
…which marks the initiation of the instability/corona.” to avoid confusion
age 8 lines 6 to 12 it is said that the Benard instability occurs because the heat
rgy absorbed by the oil exceeds the amount dissipated, and something similar
pens in the Rose-window instability. The author concludes that the instability
bilizes the system. Also, in the caption of figure 12 it is said “to maintain equilibrium
he medium”. These expressions are not rigorously right. It is right to say that the flow
ments the heat or the current transfer, but the situation is not of equilibrium neither
ore nor after the instability appears, and there is always a balance between the energy
vided and the energy dissipated if a steady state is reached.
sponse from the Author:
ve removed fig 12 about the benard instability from my manuscript and replaced it with more
resting and freshly captured schlieren images of the air gap between the needle and the oil.
