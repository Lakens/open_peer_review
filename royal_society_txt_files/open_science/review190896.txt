3. Telmisartan has a very good bioavailability p.o., and thanks to the high protein binding, the
elimination half-life is over 24h, i.e. the release profile of telmisartan tablet is figure 8B is not
relevant and misleading from a pharmacokinetic perspective, as the tablet is to design for instant
release for good bioavailability. In Fig. 8A, the telmisartan nanoparticles released near 40% in just
24 h, and release another 40% till 400h. Unless the nanoparticle is giving a blood circulation time
way over 400h (pharmacokinetic data not shown), the rest of the 60% telmisartan are unlikely to
maintain a stable blood drug concentration within the therapeutic window (as the release speed
is not consistent. The short blood circulation implying by the large >200 nm particle size also
implies that ~50% of the unreleased drug will not be bioavailable before the nanoparticle is
eliminated. If the maintenance of the blood drug concentration at the steady state requires
multiple injections, then the invention claimed in the manuscript is not valid anymore. In that
case, the author should design a multi-release kinetic packages/particles to keep the drug
concentration at steady state.
4. The author used PVA without correlating the full name poly-vinyl alcohol at the same place. In

This manuscript describes optimization of parameters for preparation of a formulation containing
drug-loaded polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) using statistical design. Telmisartan (TLM), an anti-
hypertension drug and commercial PLGA polymer are used along with PVA as surfactant. The
process controlling variables are identified by applying Plackett-Burman design and critical
process parameters are obtained using Box-Behnken design. Effect of independent variable
parameters such as polymer concentration, surfactant concentration, homogenization speed on
particle size, zeta potential and encapsulation efficiency of the TLM-loaded polymeric NPs was
studied using response surface plots. The experimental results match well with those predicted
by statistical design using the software. Various models including, Korsemeyer-Peppas and
Higuchi are applied to study the kinetics of drug release. The NPs are well characterized using
FT-IR, DSC, SEM and XRD techniques. The manuscript studies the effect of chemical nature and
physical state of the drug on formation of stable and uniform NPs.
Overall, the study has been systematically carried out using scientifically appropriate
methodologies. The use of statistical design for the formulation of TLM-loaded polymeric NPs is
novel. The results of the manuscript would be of interest to researchers working in the area of
drug formulation using polymeric nanocarriers. The manuscript is recommended for publication
in Royal Society Open Science after certain concerns as given below are addressed.
1) Formulation number of TLM-PLGA-NPs should be mentioned in figure captions.
2) Conclusion section needs revision. It should specifically summarize the results of this study.

These authors studied the application of statistical design to evaluate critical process parameters
and optimize formulation technique of polymeric nanoparticles. Their results are interesting to
the reader. I have the following questions: (1) As their models showed, the interaction and
quadratic effects are significant. So I suggest that these authors do the cubic effect investigation,
which might have higher interaction among the factors. (2) in the optimization conditions, what
are the dependent parameters?
