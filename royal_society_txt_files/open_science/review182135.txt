Reply to Reviewer’s Reports
(Manuscript ID RSOS-182135)
We are thankful to reviewers for a vigilant assessment of our manuscript. We are grateful
their thoughtful and valuable comments to improve our manuscript. All points and issues
ed by the learnt reviewers have been considered and the manuscript has been modified
ordingly. A detailed point-by-point response to all comments is provided below indicating the
lemented changes in in the revised version of the manuscript. A highlighted version by
ck Changes’ is also included with the resubmission.
Response to 1st Reviewer’s Comments
ment 1. Comments 1. Major: The advantage of the composite
materials by using Co core has not been demonstrated.
ponse 1. We are grateful to the learnt reviewere for highlighting this important point. The
following paragraph has been added in the introduction to address this matter.
Amomg the magentic materials, Iron (Fe), Cobalt (Co) and Nickel (Ni) are
considered most prominent and attractive ferromagnetic elements which belong
to the 3d-block. Owing to their excellent magnetic characteristics in the
elemental forms, they are widely used as magnetic cores for the fabrication of
nanocomposite structures. For Fe, Co and Ni, the saturation magnetization (Ms)
values are 220 emu/g, 170 emu/g and 55 emu/g, respectively at room
temperature while Curie point (TC) values are 770 ºC, 1131ºC and 358 ºC,
respectively. Although the higher Ms value of Fe makes it superior in
magnetization in comparison to Co and Ni, the larger value of negative
reduction potential (E0) proves it unstable due to fast oxidation in air. This
oxidation process at nanoscale further enhances due to larger surface to volume
ratio making Fe-nanoparticles highly prone to oxidation as compared to other
two elements. In the comparison of Co and Ni, pretty higher Curie point, larger
magnetization and greater magnetocrystalline makes Co an ideal core material
for hybrid nanostructures. Various nanocomposite materials including core-shell
structures have been reported using the Co as core material, for example, cobalt-
gold (Co@Au), cobalt-copper (Co@Cu), cobalt-platinum (Co@Pt) and cobalt-
silver (Co@Ag) nanoparticles [R1-R4]. The prominent advantages of using Co
as core material with other non-ferromagnetic materials such as Ag, Au and Cu
include giant magnetoresistance (GMR) and high stability even at higher
temperatures which are desirable properties in multifunctional sensing, media
recording and wideband photovoltaic solar cell applications [R5-R8].
ment 2. Minor: Some of the data can be combined or put part of
them into supporting information (e.g., Fig. 1-3; Fig. 6,
etc)
ponse 2. We are thankful to the reviewer for kind suggestions. Fig. 2 and 3 are combined
as recommended by the reviewer. Fig. 1 depicts the whole experimental
procedure and Fig. 6 (now Fig. 5) represents the optical analysis of prepared
colloidal samples so they are kept in the main text. However, data of Fig. 6
(now Fig. 5) has been uploaded to Dryad Digital Repository
https://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.0bk10qf
Response to 2nd Reviewer’s Comments
ment 1. This manuscript described characterization, cell toxicity
and anti-bacteria ability of cobalt cores functionalized
with varied concentration of silver nanoparticles because
magnetic cores loaded with metallic nanoparticles can be
promising nano-carriers for successful drug delivery at
infectious sites. Synthesized bimetallic nanocomposites
(Co@AgNPs) showed expected features and abilities against
bacteria. The work has been well done, and almost results
are sound. However there are some points which the authors
must address are shown as follows;
ponse 1. We are obliged to the reviewer for mentioning our work “well done “and our
results “sound”.
ment 2. In Introduction, as the authors mentioned, did they
believe that the Co@AgNPs administered can be collected
really by magnetism?
ponse 2. We are grateful to the reviewer for pointing out this point.
The manipulation of administered magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) or composite
MNPs by magnetism (external magnetic field or magnetic implants) is well
documented for different purposes including magnetic drug delivery, magnetic
separation, magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic hyperthermia [R9-R11].
The in vivo movement of MNPs strongly depends upon the factors such as
external magnetic field gradient, morphology of the MNPs, the temperature and
viscosity of the medium because these factors control the interaction of fluid
components with MNPs. By optimizing these governing parameters, the MNPs
can be accumulated in a specific area or transported to some target site [R12]. In
the case of our Co@AgNPs, since composite particles retained their magnetic
properties as revealed by VSM spectra, we can believe that our composite
MNPs can be manipulated and collected by magnetism.
ment 3. Can we further compare antibiotics and some of
nanoparticles in the same line or same level?
ponse 3. Yes, we have already shown in our previous study [R13] that AgNPs exhibited
an effective antibacterial performance comparable to antibiotics
(Ciprofloxacin).
ment 4. In Figs. 2 and 3, is there a Table or Figure on rice
consumption?
ponse 4. According to the reviewer’s recommendation, the following table describing the
quantitative details of all chemicals used in preparation of our samples shown in
Fig. 2 and 3 has been added in the main text.

composite structures (Co@AgNPs).

S3 Silver acetate _ _ Mixed by stirring
(0.2 g) added to (100 rpm) at room

ment 5. Are there any data to prove the changes in color and the
state that the authors explained?
ponse 5. As the chemical reduction reaction proceeds, different phases of the reaction
occur and reaction solution takes different colors. We took pictures of different
stages occurring during the synthesis of particles. We only obtained the UV-Vis
spectra of final stage of each sample. Similar explanations of color changes
during synthesis of NPs have also been reported in other studies [R14-R16]
ment 6. In Fig. 3, the photographs presented are not in focus.
ponse 6. Fig. 3 (now Fig. 2 lower panel) has been replaced with better resolution images.
ment 7. In Fig. 6, why is there no shoulder or peak showing silver
nanoparticles at 400 to 500 nm?
ponse 7. We are grateful to the reviewer for pointing out this matter.
The absence of any sharp peak at 400 to 500 nm could be due to various factors,
for instance, in the case of composite structure the peak position, peak width
and peak intensity may be affected by the nature and amount of the component
materials. Furthermore, the type of composite structure, for example, core-shell
or cores decorated with NPs may also affect the optical properties. Different
studies has reported the change in position and shape of absorbance bands due
to the core-shell structures, for example, red-shift and band broadening in case
of Co@Au [R17] and Co@Ag [R18] while blue-shift and increase in bandwidth
for Ni@Ag [R19] and Au @ Ag [ R20]. Also absence of any sharp absorbance
peak was reported in case of Fe3O4 cores decorated with AgNPs [R21].
In our case, we noticed different absorbance behavior for S2 and S3 as
compared to S0. The broad bands starting from 330 nm and centered at 430 nm
can be attributed to the presence of AgNPs on the Co-cores. This band
broadening may be ascribed to size distribution of both core and decorating
NPs, synergetic phase retardation effects and electron scattering at the sharing
interfaces [R22, R23]. Similar broad absorbance bands without any sharp
shoulder were reported by Lee et al. for AgNPs decorated on Fe3O4 cores [R21]
while Fageria et al [ R24] also observed the band widening and reduction in the
sharpness of the absorbance peaks for ZnO/Ag and ZnO/Au nanoparticles. The
lack of uniformity in NPs-content deposited on the cores in the case of NPs
decorated core configurations unlike the core-shell structures where uniform
and thick shells-content are present may also contribute to the band broadening
[R25] and thus causing the reduction of peak sharpness.
A paragraph has also been added in section “optical chracterization analysis” of
the main text to address this point.
ment 8. In Fig.7, is the title on the horizontal axis correct?
ponse 8. The title on the horizontal axis of Fig. 7 (now Fig. 6) has been corrected.
ment 9. As results of MTT assay, Co@AgNPs showed cytotoxicity from
5 µg / ml (significant differences should be present
between 0 of all and S0, S2 or S3). Why did the authors
explain that Co@AgNPs can be safely used? And the authors
must show significant differences among them in the
figure.
ponse 9. The degree of biocompatibility and biosafety (%) would be relative and depends
on kind of bioapplications. According to the ISO norm, a material is to be
considered biocompatible (nontoxic) and safe for bioapplications if the cell
viability is not below than 70% [R26]. In our nanocomposite (Co@AgNPs)
particles, cell viability was found to be more than 70% up to the concentration
of 10 µg/ml (74.45±2.3 %, 90.59 ±1.0 %, 81.83±2.5 %, 75.06±1.4 % for S0, S1,
S2 and S3, respectively) as shown in Fig. 8 (now Fig. 7). Thus we can say that
the prepared Co@AgNPs can have potential for bioapplications
According to the reviewer`s recommendations the significant differences among
all samples at different concentrations have been added in figure 8 (now Fig. 7).
ment 10. There are some typographical and grammatical errors in the
manuscript (For example, “respectively” must be “,
respectively”. Please check English throughout manuscript.
ponse 10. We thank the reviewer for advising to correct the typographical and
grammatical errors which will enhance the beauty of our manuscript. All the
required corrections were made accordingly.
