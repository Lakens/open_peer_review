The authors aimed at testing whether divergent visual sensitivity affects visual habitat
preferences. They also aimed at testing whether manipulating visual sensitivity by rearing fish
under two different light conditions affects the species preferences for lighting. To answer these
questions, the authors used two closely related Lake Victoria cichlids that differ in their depth
preferences – one inhabits deeper red-shifted water than the other does. Such depth preference
has been previously suggested to correspond to differences in the visual sensitivity of the species.
The authors conclude that in contrast to their hypothesis, fish did not show obvious preference to
the light conditions that mimicked their typical natural habitat.
Major concerns
In the wild, the species that occupies deeper water is exposed to a red-shifted spectrum but also
to an overall lower light intensity. Without knowing the intensity of the two experimental light
regimes, it is hard to conclude what aspect of the two light conditions drove the preference to the
‘broad spectrum’ condition. For example, it might be possible that fish actually preferred the
brighter or dimmer light condition.
What are the characteristics of the experimental light environment in terms of spectrum and
intensity? Were light intensities matched to those encountered in the natural habitats? It would
be useful to present these data relative to the lighting regimes encountered in the wild. What
were the estimated quantum catches of the various opsin types expressed in each of the species?
One of the mechanisms of the presumed divergence in visual sensitivity between the species is
differential opsin gene expression. However, the authors do not provide any evidence on
whether opsin expression differed between the tested species. Is it possible that all fish exhibited
similar gene expression as a result of their exposure to the same light condition prior to the
beginning of the experiment? How fast such plasticity in opsin gene expression could be?
The authors state (lines 55-57) that they manipulated visual development by raising the fish
under different light conditions. However, they provide no evidence for the capacity of such
manipulation. In other words, did the different light conditions actually affected the visual
sensitivity, and if so, how?
Minor concerns
Lines 39-43 – It is not clear what are the differences between P. pundamilia and P. sp.
'pundamilia-like'. The same is also true for P. nyererei. Please clarify.
Line 46 – ‘They’ presumably refers to the two species, but this isn’t clear enough.
Line 51 – Please elaborate on how the causality between visual sensitivity and habitat preferences
is being determined.
Line 74 – ‘only group-level data was recorded’ should be ‘only group-level data were recorded’.
3
Line 74-75 – What was the light regime before fish were exposed to the experimental light
regimes?
Line 86-88 – “After analysing the first two trials, we submitted P. sp. ‘pundamilia-like’ and P. sp.
‘nyererei-like’ to a third trial to increase statistical power for testing species differences.” Why not
simply say that groups were tested three times. Did the third trial differ from the two previous
ones? Actually, only when I reached Figure 2 I realized that the third trial differed from the rest
in that hybrids were not tested. It might be better to clarify this issue up front.
Line 99 – There is inconsistency in the use of the term ‘trial’. Line 87 says that the species were
subjected to a third trial. However, in line 99, it is indicated that ‘75 of the 80 trials were
successful’. Please clarify.
Line 119 – ‘nor trials’ should probably be replaced with ‘or trials’.

label_comment_2
In this ms the authors investigate whether genetic background and rearing environment affect
preference for light environment in two closely related cichlid species which might have diverged
in the wild due to distinct habitat preferences as related to their visual systems. Hence, the study
tests a clear speciation scenario, one which so far has almost not been tested. I therefore found the
study interesting, relevant and timely.
The experimental design is adecuate, as are the analysis. Sample size is perhaps somewhat small
(as in many behavioural studies), which may mask small effects. It might be worth to discuss the
issue of lack of power, and whether any observed trends at least go in the predicted direction or
not. I also have a few suggestions for improvement, or clarification, of analyses.
The main predictions are mostly not confirmed. While I´m aware that conceptually negative
4
results are just as good as positive ones and would not want to promote a publication bias in
favour of positive results, there is always the possibility that the hypotheses are in fact correct,
but the experimental test was not. You discuss that perhaps reward for correct habitat choice was
not sufficiently in place, which is important. You discard the difference in light intensity across
habitats which was not implemented, for reasons that I didn´t find so convincing. And then there
may be another 1000 factors that are imortant for the fish, but that we are not aware of and
therefore were not (correctly) manipulated. Perhaps in your paper, mention this possibility – that
your experimental test might just not have created the ecological setting that does play out in the
field, and therefore that the results are limited. This is fine, that is how science works, and
perhaps the hypoteses are indeed wrong. But if you had achieved confirmatory results, the
ecological relevance would probably not have to be questioned to the same extent.
L 32: add: and thereby increase their ecological performance
L 60: is there nothing known about (co)dominance in expression?
L 61: as written now, your predictions appear exclusive, which cannot be: they prefer their
natural light regime (L 58), and they prefer their rearing light regime. Why not simply state that
you will test if, and to what extent, genetic background and rearing regime affect habitat
preference? (And then mention the directions re. these effects).
L 68: so did you allocate entire families to treatment, or did you split families between treatments
(a stronger design)?
L 71: is the range 0-5 m the natural range? How do you expose fish to the light of a depth range?
It is in the supplement (weighting by depth use), but briefly clarify this here.
L 75: this is important, since you might then be testing for novelty avoidance (neofobia), or
novelty attraction (neofilia). OK, you discuss this later (L 144).
L 92: I was wondering why you didn´t use a binomial model, but there must be temporal
autocorrelation in your timing events, so it is hard to know how many independent time event
you would have, so the transformation seems indeed better.
L 94: activity is an interesting one. Why would activity influence habitat use by itself? More
likely, more active fish are exposed to the different environments more, and therefore can choose
better (which is probably why you demanded a minimum of four transitions). Or reverse, more
active fish move between environments more, therefore not choosing. Either way, I think it is the
interactions between activity*species, and activity*rearing environment, that are most interesting,
not the main effect of activity.
L 94: you don´t include side (“is the shallow light condition on the left or right”) as a fixed factor?
L 94: what is trial number, and why does this have replicate values (required for a random
effect)? Each trial supposedly is unique? If you refer to trial order, then this is not correct – fit it as
a fixed effect.
L 96: you mention AIC, but then give p-values, which doesn´t make much sense. And what are
minimal adecuate models – the outcome of stepwise elimination? Why not just give the results
for the full models, testing all effects via loglikelihood ratio tests?
L 105: this results sugggests you fitted trail number as a fixed effect, not as a random effect? And
you tested an interaction, but you never specified before you would test any interactions – in
“data analyses” indicate which interactions you included, and why.
L 105: 5 decimals for a p-value is way beyond its reliabilty: I think 3 decimals is precision enough.
L 116: I think this is a convoluted way to test an interaction?
L 132: genetic signatures?
L 138: and perhaps this depends also on competition? It is interesting that in the wild, the deep
fish also use shallow waters, but not the reverse, mimicking the overall preference you detected
here for shallow conditions perhaps? Might deep fish only use the deep when outcompeted by
shallow fish in shallow waters (any field data to test this density- or frequency-dependence?)? If
so, and as you already mentioned, perhaps your design was not entirely appropriate to test your
hypothesis, as reward was not included.
L 149: well, not quite – behavioural preference may depend on several factors (e.g. familiarity
versus performance), and may shift over time.
5
L 151: no hypothesis of why all fish preferred shallow light conditions?
L 154: maybe add that future experiments should try to increase the importance of relative
ecological performance across test environments, or something like that (i.e. greater
reward/punishment).
Fig. 2: there seems to be a pattern here, I´m surprised it doesn´t come out? But it actually goes
against your prediction, right? The deep species prefers shallow water more?
Supplementary materials:
L 21: there is a strong correlation between age and genetic background. Could the inclusion of
age in your models have removed the effect of genetic background?
L 60: I´m not so convinced that average difference in light intensity isn´t important because cloud
cover variation creates greater changes. Sun set creates even greater changes, but daylight
spectrum differences still matter according to you. Perhaps acknowledge in your paper that this
aspect was not manipulated, and might change the results. Someone else may try and replicate
your study (in other species perhaps), taking this into account. Just as the reward issue.
I hope these comments help to further improve an already fine paper,
Pim Edelaar.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Kristina Sefc):
Dear authors,
Your manuscript has been seen by two reviewers. The RSOS format allows you to expand the
manuscript, which will help in addressing their concerns in your revision. Reviewer 1 is
concerned that light intensity, not ony spectrum, may have played a role in the experiment, and
asks how experimental light conditions corresponded to natural conditions. Additionally, more
background on cichlid opsin gene expression may help to clarify some issues. Following reviewer
2, the discussion could delve deeper into the various factors (beyond the tested ones) that might
have influenced experimental habitat choice.
Best regards, Kristina Sefc

Comments to the Author(s)

I also was a reviewer for the previous version. The authors have responded well to the comments,
and the paper has much improved. There are a few minor things that might still need some
attention.
L 16: maybe say adaptive genetic differentiation
L 180: you still have repeat number as a random effect, so basically you are estimating a variance
based on three values (and assuming the underlying distribution is normal, for no real good
reason). This isn´t really wrong, and it should not change the results much, but it makes more
12
sense to test it as a fixed effect. Especially since you are interested in the specific effect of each
level: you later test whether repeat had a different effect for shallow-reared and deep-reared fish
(L 192). So that is similar (but less elegant and less correct) to testing for a repeat*rearing
environment effect, which you can easily include in your model if you include repeat as a fixed
effect. I mentioned this before in my review, but the authors have not picked up on it (and did
not understand the last comment about convoluted interaction testing – I hope it is clear now).
L 185: don´t start a sentence with a number: Of the 80 trials, 75 were successfull.
L 192: p=0.407? Yes, as in supplement.
L 215: perhaps also repeat that such a preference might be a contributing driver to adaptive
population divergence in the first place, to make clear why this study is very interesting.
L 226: future experiments should provide *scope for* such reward ... Of course we should not
reward the fish if they choose what we want (”predict”) them to choose, but when the
phenotype-environment match somehow affects their ecological performance (i.e. they reward
themselves). For example, if food is provided on both sides, but they only see it on one side
because of their visual capacities.

Comments to the Author(s)
I also was a reviewer for the previous version. The authors have responded well to the comments,
and the paper has much improved. There are a few minor things that might still need some
attention.
L 16: maybe say adaptive genetic differentiation
L 180: you still have repeat number as a random effect, so basically you are estimating a variance
based on three values (and assuming the underlying distribution is normal, for no real good
reason). This isn´t really wrong, and it should not change the results much, but it makes more
sense to test it as a fixed effect. Especially since you are interested in the specific effect of each
level: you later test whether repeat had a different effect for shallow-reared and deep-reared fish
(L 192). So that is similar (but less elegant and less correct) to testing for a repeat*rearing
environment effect, which you can easily include in your model if you include repeat as a fixed
effect. I mentioned this before in my review, but the authors have not picked up on it (and did
not understand the last comment about convoluted interaction testing – I hope it is clear now).
L 185: don´t start a sentence with a number: Of the 80 trials, 75 were successfull.
L 192: p=0.407? Yes, as in supplement.
L 215: perhaps also repeat that such a preference might be a contributing driver to adaptive
population divergence in the first place, to make clear why this study is very interesting.
L 226: future experiments should provide *scope for* such reward ... Of course we should not
reward the fish if they choose what we want (”predict”) them to choose, but when the
phenotype-environment match somehow affects their ecological performance (i.e. they reward
themselves). For example, if food is provided on both sides, but they only see it on one side
because of their visual capacities.

Reply letter to reviewers - RSOS manuscript submission (ref. RSOS-181876)
Dear Editorial Board and Reviewers,
We have now concluded the revision of our manuscript entitled “Visual adaptation and
microhabitat choice in Lake Victoria cichlid fish”. We have considered all comments and
suggestions by the referees, and we detail below how they were incorporated into the revision.
The main changes include adding information on opsin expression, moving supplementary
methods to the main text (particularly details on light treatments), clarifying our data analyses
and expanding our Discussion section to address specific explanations for our findings.
We believe the revised version of the manuscript has greatly improved in terms of contents and
readability, and we hope that it now meets the standards for publication in Royal Society Open
Science.
On behalf of the authors,
Daniel Mameri
REPLY TO REFEREE #1
Major concerns
Referee #1: In the wild, the species that occupies deeper water is exposed to a red-shifted
spectrum but also to an overall lower light intensity. Without knowing the intensity of the two
experimental light regimes, it is hard to conclude what aspect of the two light conditions drove
the preference to the ‘broad spectrum’ condition. For example, it might be possible that fish
actually preferred the brighter or dimmer light condition.
Reply: Indeed, the deep-water habitat is darker than the shallow-water habitat. This information
was included in the supplementary information, but we have now incorporated it in the main ms
(lines 146-150):
“At Python Islands, light intensity in the deeper P. sp. ‘nyererei-like’ habitat is about 34% of
that in the shallow P. sp. ‘pundamilia-like’ habitat (Figure 1). We did not adjust the
experimental light spectra to reproduce this difference (intensity in the deep condition was 70%
of that in the shallow condition.”
It is very well possible that the behaviour of the fish, and their preference for either environment,
was influenced by this difference light intensity. We did not address this possibility explicitly in
the text, but we have now incorporated a few sentences in the Discussion (lines 260-267):
“Our light treatments differed in both spectral composition and intensity. Therefore, we cannot
establish which of these aspects, or a combination of both, was responsible for the observed
variation in visual habitat preference. Previous studies [20,24] have recorded fish preferences
for darker or brighter environments, but these employed larger differences between habitats
(ranging from two-fold to 20-fold) than we used in the present study (light intensity in the
red-shifted condition was 70% of that in the broad-spectrum condition). Independently
manipulating both spectral composition and light intensity is feasible, and would constitute a
logical next step.”
Referee #1: What are the characteristics of the experimental light environment in terms of
spectrum and intensity? Were light intensities matched to those encountered in the natural
habitats? It would be useful to present these data relative to the lighting regimes encountered in
the wild. What were the estimated quantum catches of the various opsin types expressed in each
of the species?
Reply: Following the answer to the previous comment, we also moved to the main text the
verification of the spectra by estimating photon capture (lines 140-145; the Figure is still
presented in supplementary material, Figure S2).
Referee #1: One of the mechanisms of the presumed divergence in visual sensitivity between
the species is differential opsin gene expression. However, the authors do not provide any
evidence on whether opsin expression differed between the tested species. Is it possible that all
fish exhibited similar gene expression as a result of their exposure to the same light condition
prior to the beginning of the experiment? How fast such plasticity in opsin gene expression
could be?
The authors state (lines 55-57) that they manipulated visual development by raising the fish
under different light conditions. However, they provide no evidence for the capacity of such
manipulation. In other words, did the different light conditions actually affected the visual
sensitivity, and if so, how?
Reply: Opsin expression was not measured in the individuals used for this study. However, we
have documented changes in opsin expression in other individuals raised in these same light
treatments. We now incorporate this information in the text:
Introduction: (lines 61-63): “We have previously shown that these light treatments induce
changes in opsin expression in Pundamilia [15]. We therefore predict that the light regime
during development influences visual habitat preference as well.”
Discussion (lines 246-252): “We have previously shown that the light treatments we used here
induce changes in opsin expression in Pundamilia [15]: deep-reared fish express less
short-wavelength-sensitive opsin (SWS2a) and more long-wavelength-sensitive opsin (LWS).
Yet, we did not observe a sustained effect of the rearing environment on preference. Possibly,
the induced changes in opsin expression (5-15%) were too subtle to cause behavioural effects.
More extreme rearing environments can generate larger changes (e.g. [25]) that would
potentially influence visual habitat preference in a more persistent way.“
We do not know how fast opsin expression can change in response to altered light conditions.
We speculate that it takes longer than the 1-hour duration of the experiments, but we cannot rule
out that exposure to the experimental conditions had an effect.
We have added a section to the Discussion to address these points (lines 253-259):
“An alternative explanation for the lack of a sustained effect of the rearing light treatment, is
that the differences in opsin expression were erased during the experimental trials, as fish were
exposed to both light conditions during this time. It is unknown how quickly opsin expression
can change in response to altered light conditions. Studies in killifish [26] and cichlids [27]
suggest that changes can occur within a few days, but most studies have used much longer
exposure times (weeks to months). We expect that exposure of 1 hour is too short to induce
significant changes, but we cannot rule this out.”
Minor concerns
Referee #1: Lines 39-43 – It is not clear what are the differences between P. pundamilia and P.
sp. 'pundamilia-like'. The same is also true for P. nyererei. Please clarify.
Reply: We have expanded the text on the subject species, explaining the nomenclature and
summarising the current knowledge on their evolutionary history (lines 73-88). Specifically in
lines 83-88, we wrote:
“Here, we used laboratory-bred offspring from wild-caught fish, collected in 2010 and 2014 at
Python Islands in southern Lake Victoria [6]. Until recently, all red populations were thought
to belong to P. nyererei and all blue populations to P. pundamilia. However, the populations in
the western and southern Mwanza Gulf (including Python Islands) represent a separate
speciation event and are referred to as P. sp. ‘pundamilia-like’ & P. sp. ‘nyererei-like’ [10].”
Referee #1: Line 46 – ‘They’ presumably refers to the two species, but this isn’t clear enough.
Reply: Changed accordingly: “They” replaced with “The two species”.
Referee #1: Line 51 – Please elaborate on how the causality between visual sensitivity and
habitat preferences is being determined.
Reply: This is explained later in lines 59-61:
“(...) to assess the causal relationship between visual sensitivity and habitat preference, we
manipulate visual development by raising the fish under different light conditions.”
To further clarify this, we have now added the information that this manipulation is known to
induce changes in opsin expression (see above) and we have clarified the method of splitting
families between treatments (lines 92-97):
“To control visual development of the test fish, they were removed as eggs from
mouth-brooding females around the time of hatching (~5 days after fertilization). Each family
was then split, divided equally over two light treatments that mimicked the natural light
environments experienced by P. sp. 'pundamilia-like' (shallow water, 0-2 m) and P. sp.
'nyererei-like' (deeper water, 0-5 m) at Python Islands [6] (Figure 1; details below).”
Referee #1: Line 74 – ‘only group-level data was recorded’ should be ‘only group-level data
were recorded’.
Reply: Changed accordingly: “was” replaced by “were”.
Referee #1: Line 74-75 – What was the light regime before fish were exposed to the
experimental light regimes?
Reply: Fish were reared in the same light condtions as those used in the experiment. Thus, half
of the groups were reared in the broad-spectrum condition, and the other half was reared in the
red-shifted light condition. They remained in these conditions throughout the experimental
period, and only experienced the other condition during the experiment itself. Thus, if reared in
broad-spectrum light, fish were never exposed to the red-shifted light condition (and vice-versa).
We have added a few sentences to make this clear (lines 97-100):
“They remained in these conditions throughout the experimental period, and only experienced
the other condition during the experiment itself. Thus, fish reared in broad-spectrum light were
never exposed to the red-shifted light condition (and vice-versa), until testing.“
Referee #1: Line 86-88 – “After analysing the first two trials, we submitted P. sp.
‘pundamilia-like’ and P. sp. ‘nyererei-like’ to a third trial to increase statistical power for testing
species differences.” Why not simply say that groups were tested three times. Did the third trial
differ from the two previous ones? Actually, only when I reached Figure 2 I realized that the
third trial differed from the rest in that hybrids were not tested. It might be better to clarify this
issue up front.
Reply: Agreed and clarified in lines 168-172:
“All groups were tested twice, with approximately 2 weeks between repeats. Light environments
were switched between tank sides after the first repeat. After analysing the first two repeats, we
submitted P. sp. ‘pundamilia-like’ and P. sp. ‘nyererei-like’ groups (but not hybrid groups) to a
third repeat to increase statistical power for testing species differences.”
Referee #1: Line 99 – There is inconsistency in the use of the term ‘trial’. Line 87 says that the
species were subjected to a third trial. However, in line 99, it is indicated that ‘75 of the 80 trials
were successful’. Please clarify.
Reply: The meaning of ‘trial’ is the same, but in line 87 we are referring to a third trial from the
perspective of the test group (i.e. the 4 fish). We have clarified this by using the term ‘repeat’
instead of trial, and by inserting ‘group’ in lines 168-172.
Referee #1: Line 119 – ‘nor trials’ should probably be replaced with ‘or trials’.
Reply: Changed accordingly: “nor” replaced by “or”. We also replaced ‘trial’ with ‘repeat’ to
clarify that this is the trial number as experienced by the tested group.
REPLY TO REFEREE #2
Referee #2: The experimental design is adecuate, as are the analysis. Sample size is perhaps
somewhat small (as in many behavioural studies), which may mask small effects. It might be
worth to discuss the issue of lack of power, and whether any observed trends at least go in the
predicted direction or not. I also have a few suggestions for improvement, or clarification, of
analyses. The main predictions are mostly not confirmed. While I´m aware that conceptually
negative results are just as good as positive ones and would not want to promote a publication
bias in favour of positive results, there is always the possibility that the hypotheses are in fact
correct, but the experimental test was not. You discuss that perhaps reward for correct habitat
choice was not sufficiently in place, which is important. You discard the difference in light
intensity across habitats which was not implemented, for reasons that I didn´t find so convincing.
And then there may be another 1000 factors that are imortant for the fish, but that we are not
aware of and therefore were not (correctly) manipulated. Perhaps in your paper, mention this
possibility – that your experimental test might just not have created the ecological setting that
does play out in the field, and therefore that the results are limited. This is fine, that is how
science works, and perhaps the hypoteses are indeed wrong. But if you had achieved
confirmatory results, the ecological relevance would probably not have to be questioned to the
same extent.
Reply: We agree that the lack of a reward, and the difference in light intensity between
treatments, may have influenced the results, and we did not discuss these issues extensively in
the manuscript. We have adjusted this by moving some of the supplementary information to the
main manuscript and expanding the text in the Discussion. Please see replies below for more
details on each of these issues.
Referee #2: 32: add: and thereby increase their ecological performance
Reply: Changed accordingly.
Referee #2: L 60: is there nothing known about (co)dominance in expression?
Reply: There is no published information about this. However, our own data suggest that
heterozygotes for the LWS allele (i.e. the genotype of most hybrids) express both alleles. At this
stage, we do not think that this dataset is large enough to warrant mentioning it in this
manuscript, and we prefer to keep this conservative statement about hybrids having ‘presumably
intermediate characteristics’.
Referee #2: L 61: as written now, your predictions appear exclusive, which cannot be: they
prefer their natural light regime (L 58), and they prefer their rearing light regime. Why not
simply state that you will test if, and to what extent, genetic background and rearing regime
affect habitat preference? (And then mention the directions re. these effects).
Reply: We agree that this might have been confusing; we have rewritten this section (lines
56-63):
“If genetic differences determine visual habitat preference, we predict that individuals of either
species prefer the light regime that is closest to the one their populations are adapted to. In
addition to genetic differences however, developmental plasticity may contribute to variation in
visual sensitivity [14]. To explore this, and to assess the causal relationship between visual
sensitivity and habitat preference, we manipulate visual development by raising the fish under
different light conditions. We have previously shown that these light treatments induce changes
in opsin expression in Pundamilia [15]. We therefore predict that the light regime during
development influences visual habitat preference as well.”
Referee #2: L 68: so did you allocate entire families to treatment, or did you split families
between treatments (a stronger design)?
Reply: We did the latter; we split families between treatments. We have adjusted the text to
make this more clear (i.e. moved information from supplementary text to main text; lines
92-100):
“To control visual development of the test fish, they were removed as eggs from
mouth-brooding females around the time of hatching (~5 days after fertilization). Each family
was then split, divided equally over two light treatments that mimicked the natural light
environments experienced by P. sp. 'pundamilia-like' (shallow water, 0-2 m) and P. sp.
'nyererei-like' (deeper water, 0-5 m) at Python Islands [6] (Figure 1; details below). They
remained in these conditions throughout the experimental period, and only experienced the
other condition during the experiment itself. Thus, fish reared in broad-spectrum light were
never exposed to the red-shifted light condition (and vice-versa), until testing.”
Referee #2: L 71: is the range 0-5 m the natural range? How do you expose fish to the light of a
depth range? It is in the supplement (weighting by depth use), but briefly clarify this here.
Reply: We have moved this information to the main text (Figure 1 and lines 130-139):
“For each measurement series separately we then estimated the light environments experienced
by P. sp. 'pundamilia-like' and P. sp. 'nyererei-like', by calculating a weighted average of the
spectra at each depth, using as a weighting factor the depth distribution of each species as
reported in [6]. The average of the 4 resulting species-specific light spectra was mimicked in
the laboratory by halogen lights (Philips Halogen Masterline ES, 30 and 35W) filtered with a
green filter (#243 by LEE, Andover, UK). In the shallow light condition, blue lights (Paulmann
88090 ESL Blue Spiral 15W) were added to create a broad light spectrum. In the deep light
condition, short wavelength light was reduced by adding a yellow filter (LEE #15). The
resulting downwelling irradiance was measured with the same equipment as in the field (two
tanks for each light condition, 4 positions in each tank).”
Referee #2: L 75: this is important, since you might then be testing for novelty avoidance
(neofobia), or novelty attraction (neofilia). OK, you discuss this later (L 144).
Referee #2: L 92: I was wondering why you didn´t use a binomial model, but there must be
temporal autocorrelation in your timing events, so it is hard to know how many independent
time event you would have, so the transformation seems indeed better.
Referee #2: L 94: activity is an interesting one. Why would activity influence habitat use by
itself? More likely, more active fish are exposed to the different environments more, and
therefore can choose better (which is probably why you demanded a minimum of four
transitions). Or reverse, more active fish move between environments more, therefore not
choosing. Either way, I think it is the interactions between activity*species, and activity*rearing
environment, that are most interesting, not the main effect of activity.
Reply: The results indicate that more active fish have weaker preferences. Of course it is
difficult to establish the direction of causality here, but we think that a lack of a strong
preference promotes more frequent switching between environments. Importantly, fish activity
did not differ between species groups, rearing conditions and repeats. Also, the overall
preference for the broad-spectrum light condition, and the initial effect of the rearing condition,
were present irrespective of fish activity.
Referee #2: L 94: you don´t include side (“is the shallow light condition on the left or right”) as
a fixed factor? L 94: what is trial number, and why does this have replicate values (required for
a random effect)? Each trial supposedly is unique? If you refer to trial order, then this is not
correct – fit it as a fixed effect.
Reply: The variable “trial number” (term replaced by “repeat”) refers to the round of trials for
each fish group (varies between 1-first round, 2-second round and 3-third round, hybrids
excluded in the last one). Between trial round 1 and 2, we switched the light environment on
each side of the tank (shallow from left to right side, and deep from right to left), to account for
any side effects (though no side effects were found in preliminary studies using the same tank).
Referee #2: L 96: you mention AIC, but then give p-values, which doesn´t make much sense.
And what are minimal adecuate models – the outcome of stepwise elimination? Why not just
give the results for the full models, testing all effects via loglikelihood ratio tests?
Reply: We agree that testing all effects via loglikelihood ratio tests and other methods such as
Satterthwaite's ANOVA are more straighforward. We re-did the analyses using linear mixed
models combined with Satterthwaite's ANOVA, and re-wrote the data analyses section to better
clarify our methodology. Additionally, we added our models to the Supplementary Results
(Tables S2-S4). Please see our reply to the next comment for further details.
L 105: this results sugggests you fitted trail number as a fixed effect, not as a random effect?
And you tested an interaction, but you never specified before you would test any interactions –
in “data analyses” indicate which interactions you included, and why.
Reply: Indeed our methology for the data analyses was not clear. The linear mixed model
approach we followed, with the inclusion of ‘repeat’ as random factor, was not appropriate to
test the effect of this variable with fixed effects. Furthermore, the lack of statistical power to test
interactions should be taken into account to avoid misleading results. We clarified our data
analyses section in that sense, and applied linear mixed models (presented in Tables S2-S4) for
each of the variables we wanted to evaluate: preference for the shallow light condition (Table
S2), preference for the rearing environment (Table S3) and preference strength (Table S4). As
we were interested in seing if preference for the rearing environment would vary among repeats
in both shallow and deep-reared fish, we included ‘repeat’ as a fixed factor in the model
presented in Table S3. The section concerning data analyses was re-written as follows (lines
174-182):
“We calculated the proportion of time spent on the side of the tank with shallow light conditions
(summed for the individuals in a group) as a measure of preference, ranging from 0 to 1, and
then applied an arc-sin transformation to improve data distribution. This preference score was
fit into a linear mixed model, with the genetic group (P. sp. ‘pundamilia-like’, P. sp.
‘nyererei-like’ and hybrids), rearing environment (shallow and deep), age and activity as fixed
effects. Random effects included repeat number, nested in fish group, nested in family (some
groups came from the same family – see Table S1). Significance of each variable was tested
using Satterthwaite's ANOVA, and the minimum adequate model was obtained by removing
non-significant variables following a stepwise approach.”
Referee #2: L 105: 5 decimals for a p-value is way beyond its reliabilty: I think 3 decimals is
precision enough.
Reply: Agreed and changed accordingly (all p-values with 3 decimals).
L 116: I think this is a convoluted way to test an interaction?
Reply: We do not understand this comment. Perhaps the reviewer refers to lines 193-194,
where we test the species effect again by excluding the hybrids. This is just to show that there
really is no difference.
Referee #2: L 132: genetic signatures?
Reply: Changed accordingly: “genetic signatures of divergent selection”.
Referee #2: L 138: and perhaps this depends also on competition? It is interesting that in the
wild, the deep fish also use shallow waters, but not the reverse, mimicking the overall
preference you detected here for shallow conditions perhaps? Might deep fish only use the deep
when outcompeted by shallow fish in shallow waters (any field data to test this density- or
frequency-dependence?)? If so, and as you already mentioned, perhaps your design was not
entirely appropriate to test your hypothesis, as reward was not included.
Referee #2: L 151: no hypothesis of why all fish preferred shallow light conditions?
Reply: We have expanded the Discussion to address these comments; we now explicitly discuss
the overal preference for the shallow environment and the role of competition and predation (see
below).
Referee #2:Fig. 2: there seems to be a pattern here, I´m surprised it doesn´t come out? But it
actually goes against your prediction, right? The deep species prefers shallow water more?
Reply: Indeed, this goes against the prediction that both species would prefer their natural
habitat. We have now added a few sentences to address the overall preference for the
broad-spectrum light condition, including the role of competition and predation (lines 226-233):
“For P. sp. 'pundamilia-like', the observed preference for the broad-spectrum light condition
was expected, as it corresponds to its natural habitat. However, we expected P. sp.
'nyererei-like' to prefer the red-shifted light condition. P. sp. 'nyererei-like' also occurs in
shallow water, but it is most abundant in deeper waters [6,11]. Possibly, this depth distribution
does not reflect the preferred environment for this species, but rather emerges from ecological
interactions such as competition and predation. Predation risk by birds is higher in shallow
waters, which might affect especially the brightly coloured males of P. sp. 'nyererei-like' [23].
Both of these factors, competition and predation, were absent in our experiment.”
Referee #2: L 149: well, not quite – behavioural preference may depend on several factors (e.g.
familiarity versus performance), and may shift over time.
Reply: Adjusted accordingly (lines 268-269):
“To conclude, in this study we find evidence that Pundamilia cichlid fish exert significant
preference for visual habitat, preferring broad-spectrum over darker, red-shifted light
conditions.”
Referee #2: L 154: maybe add that future experiments should try to increase the importance of
relative ecological performance across test environments, or something like that (i.e. greater
reward/punishment).
Reply: In lines 234-236, we mention:
“Possibly, our fish did not have enough opportunity to evaluate their performance in the two
environments: while we added food cues to stimulate exploration, we did not provide an actual
reward. Matching habitat choice may be most pronounced when it generates substantial reward
[22]. Therefore, future experiments should provide such reward, in the form of e.g. food or
social interaction.”
Supplementary materials
Referee #2: L 21: there is a strong correlation between age and genetic background. Could the
inclusion of age in your models have removed the effect of genetic background?
Reply: Indeed, the different species groups differ in age, although they are all subadults.
However, the factor 'age' did not significantly affect preference (Table S2).
Referee #2: L 60: I´m not so convinced that average difference in light intensity isn´t important
because cloud cover variation creates greater changes. Sun set creates even greater changes, but
daylight spectrum differences still matter according to you. Perhaps acknowledge in your paper
that this aspect was not manipulated, and might change the results. Someone else may try and
replicate your study (in other species perhaps), taking this into account. Just as the reward issue.
Reply: Also in response to Referee 1, we have adjusted the text to address this more thoroughly,
and to make it clear how light intensities differed, both in the experiment and in nature. We
have moved the methodological information from supplementary materials to the main text.
Moreover, we agree that differences in light intensity may have influenced the findings. We did
not address this possibility explicitly in the original text, but we have now incorporated a few
sentences in the Discussion, such as in lines 260-267:
“Our light treatments differed in both spectral composition and intensity. Therefore, we cannot
establish which of these aspects, or a combination of both, was responsible for the observed
variation in visual habitat preference. Previous studies [20,24] have recorded fish preferences
for darker or brighter environments, but these employed larger differences between habitats
(ranging from two-fold to 20-fold) than we used in the present study (light intensity in the
red-shifted condition was 70% of that in the broad-spectrum condition). Independently
manipulating both spectral composition and light intensity is feasible, and would constitute a
logical next step.”
I hope these comments help to further improve an already fine paper,
Reply: Thank you!

RSOS-181876)
Dear Editorial Board and Reviewers,
We have concluded the revision of our manuscript entitled “Visual adaptation
and microhabitat choice in Lake Victoria cichlid fish”, accepted for publication
under minor revisions. We have considered the remaining comments and
suggestions by the referees, and we detail below how they were incorporated into
the manuscript.
We would like to thank all the suggestions made by the two referees during the
revision process, and also the editors involved in our manuscript submission
toRoyal Society Open Science.
On behalf of the authors,
Daniel Mameri

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have done a thorough job in addressing my concerns and applying
my suggestions. I have no further comments on the manuscript.
Reply:We thank you for all your suggestions that greatly improved the
manuscript.
Reviewer: 2
Referee #2: I also was a reviewer for the previous version. The authors have
responded well to the comments, and the paper has much improved. There are a
few minor things that might still need some attention.
Reply:We thank you for all your suggestions that greatly improved the
manuscript. We tried to address the following issues below.
Referee #2: L 16: maybe say adaptive genetic differentiation
Reply: We appreciate this suggestion, but decided to not change this. The
reason is that part of the genetic differentiation resulting from divergent
habitat choice will not be adaptive (neutral, perhaps even maladaptive). The
reduced interbreeding will affect loci all over the genome.
Referee #2: L 180: you still have repeat number as a random effect, so basically
you are estimating a variance based on three values (and assuming the underlying
distribution is normal, for no real good reason). This isn´t really wrong, and it
should not change the results much, but it makes more sense to test it as a fixed
effect. Especially since you are interested in the specific effect of each level: you
later test whether repeat had a different effect for shallow-reared and deep-reared
fish (L 192). So that is similar (but less elegant and less correct) to testing for a
repeat*rearing environment effect, which you can easily include in your model
if you include repeat as a fixed effect. I mentioned this before in my review, but
the authors have not picked up on it (and did not understand the last comment
about convoluted interaction testing ? I hope it is clear now).
Reply: We thank you for the clarification. We had three repeats in our
experimental design, and while P. pundamilia and P. nyererei groups were
tested three times, hybrids were only tested twice. Thus, we cannot
adequately assess the effect of ‘repeat’ in the full model that includes all fish.
We do need to control for it though. We therefore believe that nesting repeat
as a random effect in fish group and fish family (all random effects) for the
overall model (Table S2), in which we test our main hypothesis, seems the
best approach. We agree that the way we presented the effect of repeat for
shallow and deep-reared groups (now using ‘repeat’ as a fixed factor) in
Table S3 may be not be the most straightforward approach, but considering
the data we had, it should be suitable. Also, we believe our sample sizes are
not sufficient to explore interaction terms in a mixed model in a way that F
and p-values are fully reliable, so we preferred to present only the main
effect of ‘repeat’ in Table S3.
Referee #2: L 185: don´t start a sentence with a number: Of the 80 trials, 75 were
successfull.
Reply: Changed accordingly: “Of the 80 trials, 75 were successful.” (line 185).
L 192: p=0.407? Yes, as in supplement.
Reply: Changed accordingly: “p=0.407”, a ‘0.’ was indeed missing (line
192).
Referee #2: L 215: perhaps also repeat that such a preference might be a
contributing driver to adaptive population divergence in the first place, to make
clear why this study is very interesting.
Reply: This is a good suggestion. We added “Such preferences could
contribute to genetic differentiation between populations, particularly during
the early stages of adaptive divergence.”
Referee #2: L 226: future experiments should provide *scope for* such reward ...
Of course we should not reward the fish if they choose what we want (?predict?)
them to choose, but when the phenotype-environment match somehow affects
their ecological performance (i.e. they reward themselves). For example, if food
is provided on both sides, but they only see it on one side because of their visual
capacities.
Reply: We agree and clarified as follows (lines 226-231):
“Possibly, our fish did not have enough opportunity to evaluate their
performance in the two environments: while we added food cues to stimulate
exploration, we did not provide an actual reward that could generate vision-
dependent variation in performance. Matching habitat choice may be most
pronounced when it generates a substantial advantage [22]. Therefore, future
experiments should provide opportunity for such an advantage, in the form of
e.g. food reward or social interaction.”
Referee #2: L 272: in visual traits and habitat in the wild do not
Reply: Adjusted accordingly (lines 275-276): “Species differences in visual
traits and habitat in the wild do not translate into differences in preference.”
