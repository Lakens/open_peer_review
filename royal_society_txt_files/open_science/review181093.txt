The authors proposed a performance degradation evaluation method for turbocharger in a diesel
engine from the perspective of “gas-path diagnosis”, and the flow capacity index and the
isentropic efficiency index as two dimensionless evaluation indicators for the turbocharger health
status were firstly proposed. The case studies have illustrated that the method can accurately
isolate the degraded components, and quantify the degradation for the components. The method
proposed by the author has great potential application value for turbocharger diesel engine
industry. The manuscript is well organized and is ready for publication with modification of
written English throughout the paper to avoid grammatical errors.

The paper introduces for the first time the concept of gas-path diagnosis into the condition
monitoring of marine turbocharger, and proposes two dimensionless evaluation indicators (i.e.,
the flow capacity index and the isentropic efficiency index) as turbocharger health parameters.
The nonlinear mapping relationship between these health parameters and the gas-path
measurable parameters of the turbocharger is studied, and a performance evaluation method of
the turbocharger is developed. The proposed model is described and analyzed in detail and all
the relevant equations are explained in clear inside the paper.
The effectiveness of the proposed model is tested for three diagnostic cases for which
experimental data are available in the literature. The results are very promising and reveal the
3
capacity of the proposed model to be used in real time condition monitoring since its necessary
execution time is adequate for such applications.
The discussion and explanations provided by the authors about the findings are quite analytical
and sufficient, stand in the appropriate level and do not extend into useless details. Quality of
graphs is very good and the reader of the paper obtains easily and quickly an overview of the
findings of the investigation performed. The subject of this investigation is quite important for the
present status of technological development in the area of turbochargers and falls inside the
scope of the journal. Therefore the paper is suggested for publication without any modification.

Decision letter (RSOS-181093.R0)
27-Sep-2018
Dear Dr Yang,
The editors assigned to your paper ("A perfomance degradation evaluation method for
turbocharger in a diesel engine") have now received comments from reviewers. We would like
you to revise your paper in accordance with the referee and Associate Editor suggestions which
can be found below (not including confidential reports to the Editor). Please note this decision
does not guarantee eventual acceptance.
Please submit a copy of your revised paper before 20-Oct-2018. Please note that the revision
deadline will expire at 00.00am on this date. If we do not hear from you within this time then it
will be assumed that the paper has been withdrawn. In exceptional circumstances, extensions
may be possible if agreed with the Editorial Office in advance. We do not allow multiple rounds
of revision so we urge you to make every effort to fully address all of the comments at this stage.
If deemed necessary by the Editors, your manuscript will be sent back to one or more of the
original reviewers for assessment. If the original reviewers are not available, we may invite new
reviewers.
To revise your manuscript, log into http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision. Revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your
Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you must respond to the comments made by the
referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". Please use this to
document how you have responded to the comments, and the adjustments you have made. In
order to expedite the processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in
your response.
In addition to addressing all of the reviewers' and editor's comments please also ensure that your
revised manuscript contains the following sections as appropriate before the reference list:

If your study uses humans or animals please include details of the ethical approval received,
including the name of the committee that granted approval. For human studies please also detail
whether informed consent was obtained. For field studies on animals please include details of all
permissions, licences and/or approvals granted to carry out the fieldwork.
• Data accessibility
It is a condition of publication that all supporting data are made available either as
supplementary information or preferably in a suitable permanent repository. The data
accessibility section should state where the article's supporting data can be accessed. This section
should also include details, where possible of where to access other relevant research materials
such as statistical tools, protocols, software etc can be accessed. If the data have been deposited in
an external repository this section should list the database, accession number and link to the DOI

• Competing interests
Please declare any financial or non-financial competing interests, or state that you have no
competing interests.
• Authors’ contributions
All submissions, other than those with a single author, must include an Authors’ Contributions
section which individually lists the specific contribution of each author. The list of Authors
should meet all of the following criteria; 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, or
acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it
critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published.
All contributors who do not meet all of these criteria should be included in the
acknowledgements.
We suggest the following format:
AB carried out the molecular lab work, participated in data analysis, carried out sequence
alignments, participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript; CD carried out
the statistical analyses; EF collected field data; GH conceived of the study, designed the study,
coordinated the study and helped draft the manuscript. All authors gave final approval for
publication.
• Acknowledgements
Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship
criteria.
• Funding statement
Please list the source of funding for each author.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science charge article processing charges for all new
submissions that are accepted for publication. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to
Royal Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers
5
submitted as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry
(http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/chemistry). If your manuscript is newly submitted and
subsequently accepted for publication, you will be asked to pay the article processing charge,
unless you request a waiver and this is approved by Royal Society Publishing. You can find out
more about the charges at http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/page/charges. Should you
have any queries, please contact openscience@royalsociety.org.
