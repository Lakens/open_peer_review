The main contribution of the paper is to explore the benefits of pre-evolution (in simulation) of
robot controllers to bootstrap online evolution. Though this is not uncommon (see for example
[Cully et al. 2015 Nature], who uses a pre-evolved library of behaviour to recover from faults), the
authors propose to combines noise modelling techniques as popular in the 1990's in the
evolutionary robotics community with an online state-of-the-art optimization algorithm
(odNEAT) that can be used for both single and multiple robots. Also, experiments are conducted
with real robots (from 1 to 3, depending on the task), which is in itself a contribution to a field
where real robot implementation are too rare.
My main concern (which I think can easily be addressed) is that the scope of the contribution --
namely: the benefits of pre-evolution to seed online learning -- is not so clear from the abstract,
introduction and part of the paper because of a strong claim that I strongly disagree with and that
overshadow the true contribution:
- In the abstract, it is stated that this work "demonstrate for the first time the adaptive capabilities
of online evolution in real robotic hardware". Such demonstration have been done at least since
Watson et al. (2002) for multi-robot setups, and has been done again by many authors, incl. some
who are cited later in the paper.
- In Section Results (iii), it is stated that "this experiment is the first instance of online evolution of
collective and coordinated behaviours in a timely manner". One could argue that aggregation as a
result of phototaxis have been shown -- for example, [Bredeche et al. 2012] showed robots
aggregating around a landmark for the benefits of survival, which can be seen as phototaxis a
posteriori but which is not phototaxis defined as an objective a priori -- therefore one could argue
that it is collective decision making to aggregate to maximise survival (and phototaxis is evolved
as a proxy to do that). Also works from [Prieto et al. 2010 RAS] have shown collective decision
making with real robots to address a dual foraging tasks with competing resources, which is
collective decision making. Finally, the duration of experiments shown in earlier work are
roughly in the same order of magnitude as those shown here and/or imply many more robots, so
I am not sure with the "timely manner" argument. To sum it up: learning collective decision
making with real robots is an *important* aspect of the paper, but the fact that it is an *original*
contribution can be very controversial. Anyway, I think that the real contribution of the paper
(pre-evolution helps online evolution) is largely relevant enough to make the paper worth
reading.
OdNEAT is a very nice algorithm -- benefitting from the many useful features of NEAT is great
and its use in online evolutionary robotics is sound. In the current text, OdNEAT is, however,
never described. I would recommend to make the manuscript self-contained and suggest to add a
subsection to describe the algorithm -- something like half-a-page to a full page, providing the
basics to understand the algorithm. In particular, it was not very clear to me how OdNEAT
handles the multi-robots case (frequency of island migration, for example).
Following are comments and/or discussions (ordered wrt paper flow):
- odNEAT is always referred to as an online evolutionary algorithm, which is true. When it comes
to multi-robots, I am somewhat surprised that the authors do not make much reference to
odNEAT belonging to the class of embodied evolutionary robotics (EE). As you know, EE is but a
sub-class of online evolutionary robotics dealing with multiple robots. Actually, the multi-robot
instanciation of odNEAT is very similar to works that are explicitly defined as embodied
evolution algorithm, such as the work from [Usui and Arita 2003] when an encapsulated
evolutionary algorithm (not NEAT-related, though) in terms of hybrid/island model that mostly
rely on an internal evolutionary algorithm.

- when describing the fitness function for navigation and obstacle avoidance: please cite the
seminal 1994 paper from Floreano, or at least the 2000's book from Nolfi and Floreano, within this
section.
- Fig. 1., top is not very informative. There are keywords but it is difficult to get the idea of what
is precisely done. "post-evaluation", "online synthesis of control", "autonomous learning and
adaptation" need to be defined so that this figure is to be understood. Moreover, I wonder if this
part of the figure is really useful given it is described in the text. I would suggest to remove it as it
is more confusing that helpful compared to the description in the main text.
- Modelling sensor noise is a good idea, and there have been a great deal of work in the second
part of the 1990's. That said: more recent works taking different kind of approach could also be
discussed, such as transferability [Koos et al. 2013 IEEE TEC] or recent works with map-elite
(multiple papers from Mouret's group).
- Fig. 3(b) shows only 2 (not three, as stated in the Section 2.C) areas. Please ensure consistency (a
top view of the arena?).
- could you elaborate on the "varying condition" for evaluations?
- about "the top controller of each generation" when selecting controller for the 100 post-evolution
evaluations. Do you mean the best from each run at the last generation (meaning 30 individuals),
or the best for each generation for each run (meaning 100*30 individuals)?
- Section 3.a.i: "four setups of the navigation/obstacle avoidance...?". I may have missed
something here. Does this allude to the noise conditions? or typo and meant the four
setups/tasks? or most probably: preevolve-nonoise, preevolve-noise1, preevolve-noise2, no-
preevolve. Please clarify in the text
- on the fault injection tests: (1) only the base is specified, why not preevolved+online? (2) results
for faulty behaviours are low, and do not seem to be comparable to one another -- can you
elaborate? (3) adding an additional experience that show the results with robots with a simple
hand-coded wandering behaviour would be useful to estimate what you can expect from a
"dumb" baseline.
- you use the expression "timely manner" a lot, which not very precise... I would recommend to
give numbers rather than opinion/interpretation (e.g. time in minutes).
- I would suggest to move the robustness to noise and the ablation studies to a different section
(suggest new Section "Analysis"). Both provide additional insights into the results. In particular,
the ablation studies are not mandatory wrt to the original motivation, but provide a nice
additional contribution. Also, this part (ablation studies) should be elaborated more wrt details
and exact experimental protocol on how ablation were conducted to better support the claim
made in the last sentence.
- Discussion: can you please elaborate? there are several ideas and concepts which are difficult to
get beyond the keywords (e.g.: I did not get at all what hyper-evolution implies). Also you might
be interested in the work on novelty search [Stanley and followers] and transfer learning by
[Doncieux 2013 ICDL, Doncieux 2014 AAAI] where
concepts very close to artificial curiosity are developed to drive evolution towards interesting
behaviours.

Minor comments:
- during my first read, I missed the number of robots used for the aggregation experiment. The
fact that three robots are used is indeed mention in the text, but only once. Could you please
explicitly recall this in the results section? Thanks.
- the naming "base evolution" (= only on-line evolution) was not so clear to me. Could you come
up with a more explicit naming? (e.g.: simply "control" or "baseline")

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This paper describes experiments in which a population of small mobile robots evolve to solve
different tasks and adapt to changes. Contrary to most published work on this topic, the authors
use physical robots. More specifically, they ask how they could accelerate evolution on physical
robots using results obtained in simulation. To do so, they investigate three approaches to evolve
in simulation (without noise, with noise added to sensors, and with noise that corresponds to the
noise measured on real robots) and 3 classic tasks (obstacle avoidance, homing, and aggregation).
These ideas are well known, but they have not been much investigated in a distributed system.
The controllers are evolved using odNEAT, a variant of NEAT proposed by the authors in a
previous article. As far as I understand, the main contribution is the extension of the experiments
with odNEAT from simulation (in the previous paper) to real robots (this paper). The authors
conclude that odNEAT can find working controllers for these three tasks.
Overall, I am happy to see experiments about evolution in physical systems; however, I have two
important concerns with this article: one about the description of the methods, and one about the
so-called success of their approach.
First, the conclusion is that 'one the key enabler is odNEAT'... but odNEAT is never really
described. Actually, the authors do not even say explicitely how distributed their system is. Put
differently, nobody can understand the article in its current form if she/he does not know the
5
previous work of the authors. This would be easy to fix by adding a description of odNEAT in
the method section.
Second, the way used by the authors to measure success is hard to understand: this makes me
question if I understood anything from their results. Given the introduction, the reader expects
box-plots that show that solutions found by seeding the population perform better (or worse)
than solutions found with direct evolution on the physical robots. There is nothing like this in the
paper. Instead, we find _in the supplementary text_ (Text S3) some numbers about 'the mean
percentage of successful controllers' which, I suppose, is linked to the performance of each
replicate. However, I expected something like 'the number of runs that succeed in finding
working solutions for the task' or something like the median fitness after one hour of evolution.
And I expected this result in the main text. In this supplementary text, we discover that (1)
seeding makes a difference in the first task, but no difference in the other tasks (homing,
aggregation, and task adaptation experiment) and (2) in all the tasks except the first (obstacle
avoidance), the percentage of successful behavior is quite small (e.g. 3-4%).
Why is this critical information hidden in the supplementaries? This should be the main result of
the paper (at least according to the introduction). And, if I understood well, this also suggests
that the approach proposed by the authors is not working as well as what they try to suggest it. I
think this information should be in the main text and commented; in addition, the authors should
explain why they compute this 'mean percentage of successful controllers' (and not a more classic
metric). Instead of having results that are easy to understand, the main text focuses on the
performance of the (few) 'successful controllers' (Fig.4) but the differences do not appear to be
very significant and I did not manage to understand why it was more relevant than the success
rate / fitness at the end of each replicate.
In summary, I cannot conclude from the current text if the approach proposed by the author
'works' or 'does not work', and I cannot conclude if their initial proposition of seeding evolution
with simulation results helps or not.
A third concern is that the authors do not compare their approach to anything else, therefore I
cannot understand how they can write (in the conclusion and in the abstract) that 'we showed
that one key enabler of the robots' ability to effectively learn and adapt is the underlying
evolutionary algorithm odNEAT'. As far as I understand, they only showed that all the
components of odNEAT (which are actually the components of NEAT, published in 2002) are
helping (in the 'ablation' experiment). They did not show that a similar result could not be
obtained with a different algorithm.
Minor remarks:
- In the introduction, the authors claim that almost no experience have been carried out with
evolving robots that can adapt to changes. References [1] and [2] are missing.
- the term 'behavior-fitness map' was first employed in [3], but with a slightly different meaning:
the authors should choose a different term or at least describe the differences;
- there are statistical tests for the results reported in the supplementaries, but none in the results
described in the main text (Fig.4 and Fig.5)

label_comment_3
This is a very good paper. It addresses some very interesting research questions in evolutionary
robotics, which are very well formulated. The paper is very clear, well structured and the
standard of English is very high. Thus I have only minor comments.
1. On pages 4 and 5, section headed Evolution in Simulation: why specifically 30 independent
runs? In the explanation that follows it is not clear what the exact relationship is between setup,
run, generation and simulation. What is the need for a post evolution evaluation (and why
specifically 100 simulations) given that fitness testing was presumably done during evolution?
2. On page 6 how does a robot itself measure pt?
3. On page section on fault injection experiments, I suggest you reference prior work
investigating fault tolerance in swarms, i.e. Bjerknes and Winfield (2013) On fault tolerance and
scalability of swarm robotic systems. Distributed Autonomous Robotic Systems: The 10th
International Symposium. (83) Springer, pp. 431-444.
4. On page 10, 11 section on evolution of collective behaviours, note that online evolution in
ODowd et al, (2014) The distributed co-evolution of an on-board simulator and controller for
swarm robot behaviours. Evolutionary Intelligence, 7 (2). pp. 95-106, took place in a similar
timeframe (1 hour) to the experiments of your paper.
5. Re page 14 open source data. I was disappointed that I was unable to access the data logs and
source code. I would be especially keen to check that the data is properly annotated to explain the
7
data fields and structures. Also are any videos of sample experiments included to illustrate the
different experiments?

And I expected this result in the main text. In this supplementary text, we discover that (1)
seeding makes a difference in the first task, but no difference in the other tasks (homing,
aggregation, and task adaptation experiment) and (2) in all the tasks except the first (obstacle
avoidance), the percentage of successful behavior is quite small (e.g. 3-4%).
Why is this critical information hidden in the supplementaries? This should be the main result of
the paper (at least according to the introduction). And, if I understood well, this also suggests
that the approach proposed by the authors is not working as well as what they try to suggest it. I
12
think this information should be in the main text and commented; in addition, the authors should
explain why they compute this 'mean percentage of successful controllers' (and not a more classic
metric). Instead of having results that are easy to understand, the main text focuses on the
performance of the (few) 'successful controllers' (Fig.4) but the differences do not appear to be
very significant and I did not manage to understand why it was more relevant than the success
rate / fitness at the end of each replicate.
In summary, I cannot conclude from the current text if the approach proposed by the author
'works' or 'does not work', and I cannot conclude if their initial proposition of seeding evolution
with simulation results helps or not.
A third concern is that the authors do not compare their approach to anything else, therefore I
cannot understand how they can write (in the conclusion and in the abstract) that 'we showed
that one key enabler of the robots' ability to effectively learn and adapt is the underlying
evolutionary algorithm odNEAT'. As far as I understand, they only showed that all the
components of odNEAT (which are actually the components of NEAT, published in 2002) are
helping (in the 'ablation' experiment). They did not show that a similar result could not be
obtained with a different algorithm.
Minor remarks:
- In the introduction, the authors claim that almost no experience have been carried out with
evolving robots that can adapt to changes. References [1] and [2] are missing.
- the term 'behavior-fitness map' was first employed in [3], but with a slightly different meaning:
the authors should choose a different term or at least describe the differences;
- there are statistical tests for the results reported in the supplementaries, but none in the results
described in the main text (Fig.4 and Fig.5)

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a very good paper. It addresses some very interesting research questions in evolutionary
robotics, which are very well formulated. The paper is very clear, well structured and the
standard of English is very high. Thus I have only minor comments.
1. On pages 4 and 5, section headed Evolution in Simulation: why specifically 30 independent
runs? In the explanation that follows it is not clear what the exact relationship is between setup,
run, generation and simulation. What is the need for a post evolution evaluation (and why
specifically 100 simulations) given that fitness testing was presumably done during evolution?
13
2. On page 6 how does a robot itself measure pt?
3. On page section on fault injection experiments, I suggest you reference prior work
investigating fault tolerance in swarms, i.e. Bjerknes and Winfield (2013) On fault tolerance and
scalability of swarm robotic systems. Distributed Autonomous Robotic Systems: The 10th
International Symposium. (83) Springer, pp. 431-444.
4. On page 10, 11 section on evolution of collective behaviours, note that online evolution in
ODowd et al, (2014) The distributed co-evolution of an on-board simulator and controller for
swarm robot behaviours. Evolutionary Intelligence, 7 (2). pp. 95-106, took place in a similar
timeframe (1 hour) to the experiments of your paper.
5. Re page 14 open source data. I was disappointed that I was unable to access the data logs and
source code. I would be especially keen to check that the data is properly annotated to explain the
data fields and structures. Also are any videos of sample experiments included to illustrate the
different experiments?

Thank you for the changes. The paper has been significantly improved, but I still have a few
requests.
14
First, I still do not understand why the results are presented as "percentage of successful
evaluations in one hour": once we have a successful controller, the adaptation is done and we can
use this good controller. As a consequence, what matters more is "how much time (how many
evaluations) do I need to solve the task?" Moreover, I do not understand why the "real samples"
treatment seems to perform well in Fig.S1, but in the text the differences between the three
treatments are not significant (3.a.ii, line 43). In addition, the success rates should be presented in
a table or a figure.
Second, it should be clear in the abstract and conclusion if seeding from simulation is helping or
not. It seems to be useful for the first task, I do not know for the second task, and useless for the
third task.
Last, I still disagree with the sentence (in abstract and conclusion): "... one key enabler [...] is a
high-performance approach called odNEAT". It should be something like "all the components of
the evolutionary algorithm used in this study (odNEAT) contribute to the performance of the
algorithm" (or something along this line: the author do not show that odNEAT is superior to any
competing approach, even if odNEAT without some components is close to some alternative
approaches.
Minor requests:
- the link to the source code is missing
- I did not find the parameters of odNEAT (in particular, the number of robots and all the NEAT
parameters)
- In the supplementaries, the authors should not use means (table S1) but medians, to be
consistent with the Mann-Whitney test and the boxplots.
- Fig S1(A) and S1(B) have inconsistent colors

Response to the reviews for
Evolutionary Online Behaviour Learning and
Adaptation in Real Robots
by Fernando Silva, Luís Correia, and Anders Lyhne Christensen
Manuscript id: <U+200B>RSOS-160938<U+200B>, <U+200B>date: April 12, 2017
We would like to thank the reviewers for their thorough <U+200B>reviews. We have addressed
the comments made by the reviewers to strengthen our paper. Below, we respond to
the reviewers comments individually.
Detailed replies to the reviewers comments
__________________________________________________________________
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The main contribution of the paper is to explore the benefits of pre-evolution (in simulation)
of robot controllers to bootstrap online evolution. Though this is not uncommon (see for
example [Cully et al. 2015 Nature], who uses a pre-evolved library of behaviour to recover
from faults), the authors propose to combines noise modelling techniques as popular in the
1990's in the evolutionary robotics community with an online state-of-the-art optimization
algorithm (odNEAT) that can be used for both single and multiple robots. Also, experiments
are conducted with real robots (from 1 to 3, depending on the task), which is in itself a
contribution to a field where real robot implementation are too rare.
My main concern (which I think can easily be addressed) is that the scope of the contribution
-- namely: the benefits of pre-evolution to seed online learning -- is not so clear from the
abstract, introduction and part of the paper because of a strong claim that I strongly disagree
with and that overshadow the true contribution:
- In the abstract, it is stated that this work "demonstrate for the first time the adaptive
capabilities of online evolution in real robotic hardware". Such demonstration have been
done at least since Watson et al. (2002) for multi-robot setups, and has been done again by
many authors, incl. some who are cited later in the paper.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>We have rephrased the abstract to improve clarity (emphasis added below to
indicate changes to text). Contributions such as that of Watson et al. (2002) show
real robots learning how to solve a given task online. However, real-robot
demonstrations of the ability to overcome faults and adapt to changes in
environmental conditions have not previously been shown in the context of online
evolution.
[...] We furthermore demonstrate for the first time the adaptive capabilities of online
evolution in real robotic hardware, <U+200B>including robots able to overcome faults
injected in the motors of multiple units simultaneously, and to modify their
behaviour in response to changes in the task requirements<U+200B>.<U+200B> <U+200B>[...]
- In Section Results (iii), it is stated that "this experiment is the first instance of online
evolution of collective and coordinated behaviours in a timely manner". One could argue that
aggregation as a result of phototaxis have been shown -- for example, [Bredeche et al. 2012]
showed robots aggregating around a landmark for the benefits of survival, which can be
seen as phototaxis a posteriori but which is not phototaxis defined as an objective a priori --
therefore one could argue that it is collective decision making to aggregate to maximise
survival (and phototaxis is evolved as a proxy to do that). Also works from [Prieto et al. 2010
RAS] have shown collective decision making with real robots to address a dual foraging
tasks with competing resources, which is collective decision making. Finally, the duration of
experiments shown in earlier work are roughly in the same order of magnitude as those
shown here and/or imply many more robots, so I am not sure with the "timely manner"
argument. To sum it up: learning collective decision making with real robots is an *important*
aspect of the paper, but the fact that it is an *original* contribution can be very controversial.
Anyway, I think that the real contribution of the paper (pre-evolution helps online evolution) is
argely relevant enough to make the paper worth reading.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>Phototaxis/aggregation around a landmark, as in Bredeche et al. (2012), does
not require coordinated movement or cooperation and, in that sense, it is a task of an
individual nature being performed by multiple robots in parallel. On the other hand,
aggregation without a landmark, as our version of the aggregation task, requires
collectively coordinated behaviours so that dispersed robots move close to one
another, and then form and remain in a single group.
We have rephrased the second paragraph of Section 3 (a) (iii) <U+200B>to clarify that the focus
is on the evolution of collectively coordinated behaviours (emphasis added here to
indicate changes to text). We additionally removed the timely manner argument, as
suggested by the reviewer.
[...] To the best of our knowledge, this experiment is the first instance of online
evolution of <U+200B>collectively coordinated behaviours with real robots<U+200B>. Previous
studies involving multiple robots have been limited to individual tasks such as
phototaxis [25], dynamic phototaxis [3], foraging [26], and a combination of foraging
and phototaxis (robots can use a moving light source as an environmental aid) in
which controllers are evolved in an onboard simulator [27].
OdNEAT is a very nice algorithm -- benefitting from the many useful features of NEAT is
great and its use in online evolutionary robotics is sound. In the current text, OdNEAT is,
however, never described. I would recommend to make the manuscript self-contained and
suggest to add a subsection to describe the algorithm -- something like half-a-page to a full
page, providing the basics to understand the algorithm. In particular, it was not very clear to
me how OdNEAT handles the multi-robots case (frequency of island migration, for example).
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>We have added a new section called Online Evolution of Control with
odNEAT [Section 2(a)], in which we describe the main features of odNEAT,
including how the algorithm operates when multiple robots are considered. As
suggested by the reviewer, the section is approximately half a page long.
Following are comments and/or discussions (ordered wrt paper flow):
- odNEAT is always referred to as an online evolutionary algorithm, which is true. When it
comes to multi-robots, I am somewhat surprised that the authors do not make much
reference to odNEAT belonging to the class of embodied evolutionary robotics (EE). As you
know, EE is but a sub-class of online evolutionary robotics dealing with multiple robots.
Actually, the multi-robot instanciation of odNEAT is very similar to works that are explicitly
defined as embodied evolution algorithm, such as the work from [Usui and Arita 2003] when
an encapsulated evolutionary algorithm (not NEAT-related, though) in terms of hybrid/island
model that mostly rely on an internal evolutionary algorithm.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>In online evolutionary robotics, terms such as embodied evolution are often
used inconsistently. For example, the original definition of embodied evolution by
Watson et al. (2002) described a single genome/controller per robot. Usui and Aritas
(2003) algorithm, and several others such as odNEAT, employ one *population* of
candidate controllers per robot.
Given the lack of a precise and consistent use of terminology in online evolution
research, we avoid stating that odNEAT belongs to any particular class of algorithms,
but instead provide details on how the algorithm operates, including in the new
section called Online Evolution of Control with odNEAT, as follows (emphasis
added here):
odNEAT is distributed across multiple robots that exchange candidate solutions to
the task. Specifically, the evolutionary process is implemented according to a
physically distributed island model. <U+200B>Each robot optimises an internal population
of genomes <U+200B>(directly encoded artificial neural networks) through intra-island
variation, and genetic <U+200B>information between two or more robots is exchanged
through inter-island migration<U+200B>. [...]
- when describing the fitness function for navigation and obstacle avoidance: please cite the
seminal 1994 paper from Floreano, or at least the 2000's book from Nolfi and Floreano,
within this section.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>As suggested by the reviewer, we now cite the seminal paper from Floreano
and Mondada (1994) when describing the fitness function for the navigation and
obstacle avoidance task.
- Fig. 1., top is not very informative. There are keywords but it is difficult to get the idea of
what is precisely done. "post-evaluation", "online synthesis of control", "autonomous learning
and adaptation" need to be defined so that this figure is to be understood. Moreover, I
wonder if this part of the figure is really useful given it is described in the text. I would
suggest to remove it as it is more confusing that helpful compared to the description in the
main text.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>As suggested by the reviewer, we have removed Fig. 1 (A).
- Modelling sensor noise is a good idea, and there have been a great deal of work in the
second part of the 1990's. That said: more recent works taking different kind of approach
could also be discussed, such as transferability [Koos et al. 2013 IEEE TEC] or recent works
with map-elite (multiple papers from Mouret's group).
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>In Section 2<U+200B>, <U+200B>we have included a discussion on how different approaches
could be used in the modelling of robot sensors and actuators (end of page 3,
beginning of page 4; emphasis added here):
[...] It should be noted that our approach to modelling robot sensors and
actuators in simulation does not preclude the use of more elaborate
methodologies, such as the <U+200B>transferability approach [13]. <U+200B>The transferability
approach relies on multiobjective optimisation in which controllers are evaluated
based on their performance in simulation and on the real robots; it uses a surrogate
model that is updated periodically by evaluating candidate solutions in real hardware.
The goal is to learn the discrepancies between simulation and reality, and to
constrain evolution in order to avoid behaviours that may not transfer effectively from
simulation to reality.
- Fig. 3(b) shows only 2 (not three, as stated in the Section 2.C) areas. Please ensure
consistency (a top view of the arena?).
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>Fig. 2 (B) (page 6; real environment for the aggregation and adaptation
experiments) actually shows three areas, namely: a white area, a gray area, and a
black area. We have improved the caption of the figure to aid in clarity (emphasis
added here):
Real environment for the homing experiments <U+200B>(A)<U+200B>, and for the aggregation and
adaptation experiments <U+200B>(B)<U+200B>. <U+200B>The environment for the aggregation and adaptation
experiments is composed of three areas, namely a black area (top), a grey area
(middle), and a white area (bottom).<U+200B>
- could you elaborate on the "varying condition" for evaluations?
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>As suggested by the reviewer, we have elaborated on the varying conditions
for evaluations (page 4, Evolution in simulation):
[...] simulations with varying conditions (e.g. randomised initial position and
orientation, amount of noise injected at every simulation step in sensors and/or
actuators).[...]
- about "the top controller of each generation" when selecting controller for the 100
post-evolution evaluations. Do you mean the best from each run at the last generation
(meaning 30 individuals), or the best for each generation for each run (meaning 100*30
ndividuals)?
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>We mean the best controller of each generation, for each individual run. We
now explicitly state the number of controllers evaluated to improve clarity (page 4,
Evolution in simulation):
[...] The top controller of each generation was evaluated in 100 simulations (total of
3,000 controllers evaluated without evolution) to obtain a more precise estimate of
the performance.[...]
- Section 3.a.i: "four setups of the navigation/obstacle avoidance...?". I may have missed
something here. Does this allude to the noise conditions? or typo and meant the four
setups/tasks? or most probably: preevolve-nonoise, preevolve-noise1, preevolve-noise2,
no-preevolve. Please clarify in the text
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>We refer precisely to the baseline, no noise, conservative noise, and
real samples. We now explicitly list the setups in the text to aid in clarity, see
Section 3 (a) (i), pages 9 and 10:
Figure 3 shows two-dimensional behaviour-fitness maps<U+200B>, which relate behaviour
distance with task performance, for the four setups of the navigation and obstacle
avoidance task (baseline, controllers pre-evolved in simulations using perfect sensor
readings, a conservative form of noise in simulated sensors, and samples from real
robots) [...].
- on the fault injection tests: (1) only the base is specified, why not preevolved+online? (2)
results for faulty behaviours are low, and do not seem to be comparable to one another --
can you elaborate? (3) adding an additional experience that show the results with robots with
a simple hand-coded wandering behaviour would be useful to estimate what you can expect
from a "dumb" baseline.
<U+25CF> Reply:
<U+25CB> (1) <U+200B>In the fault-injection experiments, robots first evolve for one hour to solve
the initial version of the aggregation task. We have selected robots from the
baseline setup for simplicity. Specifically, we selected the best group of robots
(highest fitness on average), which were able to efficiently solve the
aggregation task. However, as we have added in the first paragraph of
Section 4. Discussion, it may be interesting to actively investigate such biases
in a future study, that is, how pre-evolution in simulation can influence not
only learning to solve a task (as in our first set of experiments), but also
re-adaptation in the case of changes in environmental conditions and faults
(as in our second set of experiments).
<U+25CB> (2) <U+200B>As indicated in the second paragraph of Section 3 (b) (ii), page 13, the
amount of time aggregated is expected to be lower because: [...] faulty
robots, even after they learn to cope with a faulty wheel, are still limited in the
speed they can achieve (from 50% to 75% of the maximum speed). As a
result, robots require more time to find one another and aggregate [...].
In addition, the different configurations cause robots to be in different
situations. For example, in the one-fault setup [...] only one robot is in a faulty
state. The faulty robot has to learn to overcome the fault by itself, as
controllers evolved by the other two robots in the group are optimised for
non-faulty wheels, and cause the faulty robot to move in circles. [...], hence
the differences in the results.
<U+25CB> (3) <U+200B>We are not sure if and how a simple hand-coded wandering behaviour
would constitute a meaningful baseline, and we have therefore chosen not to
include such experiments in our study.
- you use the expression "timely manner" a lot, which not very precise... I would recommend
to give numbers rather than opinion/interpretation (e.g. time in minutes).
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>We have reviewed the paper and rephrased the sentences in which we
previously used the expression timely manner (removed from the sentence or
replaced with the time-frame of our experiments -- one hour). The expression timely
manner is now used only in the abstract, in conjunction with the time-frame of the
experiments:
[...] In all cases, capable solutions are found in a timely manner (one hour or less).
- I would suggest to move the robustness to noise and the ablation studies to a different
section (suggest new Section "Analysis"). Both provide additional insights into the results. In
particular, the ablation studies are not mandatory wrt to the original motivation, but provide a
nice additional contribution. Also, this part (ablation studies) should be elaborated more wrt
details and exact experimental protocol on how ablation were conducted to better support
the claim made in the last sentence.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>We tried the reviewers suggestion of dividing the results section, which is
approximately five-pages long, into two sections. We found that this alternative
structure broke the flow of the paper. We thus reverted back to the original structure,
in which the presentation of the experimental results is divided into three
subsections. In the first subsection, we report on how to best seed online evolution in
real hardware. In the second subsection, we describe if and how online evolution can
enable adaptation to unforeseen circumstances. In the third subsection, we detail
and discuss how the properties and different algorithm components of odNEAT
influence controller synthesis.
Regarding the ablation studies, we agree with the reviewers comment that more
details were needed. We therefore moved explanatory information from the
supplementary material (section previously called Text S2 - Ablation Experiments)
to the corresponding section of the main paper.
- Discussion: can you please elaborate? there are several ideas and concepts which are
difficult to get beyond the keywords (e.g.: I did not get at all what hyper-evolution implies).
Also you might be interested in the work on novelty search [Stanley and followers] and
transfer learning by [Doncieux 2013 ICDL, Doncieux 2014 AAAI] where concepts very close
to artificial curiosity are developed to drive evolution towards interesting behaviours.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>We have revised the first part of the discussion, namely Section 4 (a), page
15, including the description of the principles underlying online hyper-evolution
(which can make use of techniques such as novelty search):
[...] a novel paradigm called online hyper-evolution [30, 31], which can both combine
the benefits of different algorithms for controller generation over time, and <U+200B>construct
algorithms by selecting which algorithmic components should be employed for
controller generation (e.g. mutation, crossover, among others). Similarly to traditional
evolutionary robotics approaches, online hyper-evolution can employ fitness-based
search, behaviour-based search (novelty and/or diversity), and combinations of the
two. Future work should assess how such techniques fare in real-robot online
evolution of control.
Minor comments:
- during my first read, I missed the number of robots used for the aggregation experiment.
The fact that three robots are used is indeed mention in the text, but only once. Could you
please explicitly recall this in the results section? Thanks.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>As suggested by the reviewer, we have added this information to the
corresponding section of the results, see Section 3 (a) (iii), in order to remind the
reader of the number of robots employed.
- the naming "base evolution" (= only on-line evolution) was not so clear to me. Could you
come up with a more explicit naming? (e.g.: simply "control" or "baseline")
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>As suggested by the reviewer, we now use the term baseline to denote the
experiments in which only online evolution is employed.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper describes experiments in which a population of small mobile robots evolve to
solve different tasks and adapt to changes. Contrary to most published work on this topic,
the authors use physical robots. More specifically, they ask how they could accelerate
evolution on physical robots using results obtained in simulation. To do so, they investigate
three approaches to evolve in simulation (without noise, with noise added to sensors, and
with noise that corresponds to the noise measured on real robots) and 3 classic tasks
(obstacle avoidance, homing, and aggregation). These ideas are well known, but they have
not been much investigated in a distributed system. The controllers are evolved using
odNEAT, a variant of NEAT proposed by the authors in a previous article. As far as I
understand, the main contribution is the extension of the experiments with odNEAT from
simulation (in the previous paper) to real robots (this paper). The authors conclude that
odNEAT can find working controllers for these three tasks.
Overall, I am happy to see experiments about evolution in physical systems; however, I have
two important concerns with this article: one about the description of the methods, and one
about the so-called success of their approach.
First, the conclusion is that 'one the key enabler is odNEAT'... but odNEAT is never really
described. Actually, the authors do not even say explicitely how distributed their system is.
Put differently, nobody can understand the article in its current form if she/he does not know
the previous work of the authors. This would be easy to fix by adding a description of
odNEAT in the method section.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>We have added a new section called Online Evolution of Control with
odNEAT [Section 2 (a), page 5], in which we describe the main features of odNEAT,
including how the algorithm operates when multiple robots are considered.
Second, the way used by the authors to measure success is hard to understand: this makes
me question if I understood anything from their results. Given the introduction, the reader
expects box-plots that show that solutions found by seeding the population perform better (or
worse) than solutions found with direct evolution on the physical robots. There is nothing like
this in the paper.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>The main paper contains multiple behaviour-fitness maps that relate task
performance with behaviour (Figure 3, composed of four maps), and boxplots
comparing different approaches in the different tasks (Figure 4, composed of two
plots, and Figure 5, composed of one plot). We have reviewed the references to the
figures in the text to ensure that they are clear.
Please note that we also included extensive results as part of the supplementary
material (e.g. additional behaviour-fitness maps, and analysis of how the
highest-performing controllers found in simulation transferred to real robots).
Instead, we find _in the supplementary text_ (Text S3) some numbers about 'the mean
percentage of successful controllers' which, I suppose, is linked to the performance of each
replicate. However, I expected something like 'the number of runs that succeed in finding
working solutions for the task' or something like the median fitness after one hour of
evolution. And I expected this result in the main text. In this supplementary text, we discover
that (1) seeding makes a difference in the first task, but no difference in the other tasks
(homing, aggregation, and task adaptation experiment) and (2) in all the tasks except the
first (obstacle avoidance), the percentage of successful behavior is quite small (e.g. 3-4%).
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>In the main paper, we now provide a more detailed analysis of the results, as
we have moved the information on the successful controller evaluations from the
supplementary material to the main paper. Please note that seeding does, in fact,
impose different constraints on the online evolutionary and re-adaptation process in
the three tasks (see text for details), and that the mean percentage of successful
controller evaluations for all tasks but the first (navigation and obstacle avoidance) is
on average:
- from 3.7% to 6.3% in the homing task, which amounts to 4 to 8 solutions to the task
per one-hour experiment,
- from 8.7% to 14.8% in the aggregation task (10 to 18 <U+200B>groups of successful
controllers per one-hour experiment),
- 11.7% in the task adaptation experiments (14 groups of successful controllers per
one-hour experiment),
- from 3.0% to 14.7% in the fault injection experiments (4 to 18 groups of successful
controllers) , and
- from 1.5% to 11.5% in the ablation experiments (2 to 14 groups of successful
controllers).
Because every run typically produces controllers that solve the task, 'the number of
runs that succeed in finding working solutions for the task' provides little information.
We therefore complemented our results with an analysis of the successful controller
evaluations per robot/run The definition of successful controller evaluations was
originally detailed in the supplementary material (beginning of Text S3, which no
longer exists), and has now been moved to the main paper [Section 2 (f)].
Why is this critical information hidden in the supplementaries? This should be the main result
of the paper (at least according to the introduction). And, if I understood well, this also
suggests that the approach proposed by the authors is not working as well as what they try
to suggest it. I think this information should be in the main text and commented; in addition,
the authors should explain why they compute this 'mean percentage of successful
controllers' (and not a more classic metric). Instead of having results that are easy to
understand, the main text focuses on the performance of the (few) 'successful controllers'
(Fig.4) but the differences do not appear to be very significant and I did not manage to
understand why it was more relevant than the success rate / fitness at the end of each
replicate.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>We have moved the information on the mean percentage of successful
controller evaluations from the supplementary material to the main paper.
Regarding the comment on more classic metrics: it should be noted that we have
analysed the fitness score of all solutions evolved (see, for example, the
behaviour-fitness maps in the main paper and in the supplementary material). We
have additionally complemented our analysis of fitness with metrics that could be
considered more intuitive to the reader, namely the amount of time that robot spent in
the target area (homing task), and the amount of time that robots spent aggregated
(aggregation task). We have now improved the presentation and analysis of the
results to make the above points clear.
In summary, I cannot conclude from the current text if the approach proposed by the author
works' or 'does not work', and I cannot conclude if their initial proposition of seeding
evolution with simulation results helps or not.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>As indicated above, we have addressed the reviewers comments in order to
improve the presentation of results and strengthen our contribution.
A third concern is that the authors do not compare their approach to anything else, therefore
I cannot understand how they can write (in the conclusion and in the abstract) that 'we
showed that one key enabler of the robots' ability to effectively learn and adapt is the
underlying evolutionary algorithm odNEAT'. As far as I understand, they only showed that all
the components of odNEAT (which are actually the components of NEAT, published in 2002)
are helping (in the 'ablation' experiment). They did not show that a similar result could not be
obtained with a different algorithm.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>odNEAT represents a state of the art algorithm that efficiently optimises both
the parameters and the topological structure of artificial neural networks; see, for
example, <U+200B>Silva, F., Urbano, P., Correia, L., & Christensen, A. L. (2015). odNEAT: An
algorithm for decentralised online evolution of robotic controllers. Evolutionary
Computation, 23(3), 421-449 <U+200B>in which it is compared to two different state of the art
algorithms.
The set of algorithmic components employed by odNEAT, be them inherited from NEAT or
exclusive to odNEAT, all contribute to the algorithms performance as an efficient online
evolution algorithm. This research question is investigated in the ablation studies, in which
we assess the contribution of the main components of odNEAT on performance, and even
disable the algorithms main features. We extended the section on the ablation studies to
clarify that, for example, disabling odNEATs main features transforms the algorithm into:
[...] a variation of the (1+1)-online algorithm [23], which was proposed after the
classic (1+1) evolutionary strategy, and upon which multiple online evolution
algorithms are based [3,4].
Minor remarks:
- In the introduction, the authors claim that almost no experience have been carried out with
evolving robots that can adapt to changes. References [1] and [2] are missing.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>We have added the two references suggested by the reviewer to the list of
examples in the introduction.
- the term 'behavior-fitness map' was first employed in [3], but with a slightly different
meaning: the authors should choose a different term or at least describe the differences;
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>When describing our concept of behaviour-fitness map, we now describe the
differences with respect to the concept of behaviour-performance map in [3]
(emphasis added here):
[...] To understand how the evolutionary process proceeds, we construct
two-dimensional <U+200B>behaviour-fitness maps<U+200B>, which relate behaviour distance with task
performance. It should be noted that our concept of behaviour-fitness map
differs from the concept of <U+200B>behaviour-performance map presented in [22],
which is used to record the highest-performing individual found during evolution for
each point in a discretised version of the behaviour space.
- there are statistical tests for the results reported in the supplementaries, but none in the
results described in the main text (Fig.4 and Fig.5)
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>We have moved the statistical tests from the supplementary material to the
main paper [see, for instance, the first paragraph of Sections 3 (a) (i), (ii) and (iii)].

Reviewer: 3
This is a very good paper. It addresses some very interesting research questions in
evolutionary robotics, which are very well formulated. The paper is very clear, well structured
and the standard of English is very high. Thus I have only minor comments.
1. On pages 4 and 5, section headed Evolution in Simulation: why specifically 30
ndependent runs? In the explanation that follows it is not clear what the exact relationship is
between setup, run, generation and simulation. What is the need for a post evolution
evaluation (and why specifically 100 simulations) given that fitness testing was presumably
done during evolution?
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>The number of independent runs was chosen to facilitate a sound statistical
analysis. We have reviewed the description of Evolution in simulation to improve
clarity:
[...] We conducted experiments in nine evolutionary setups (three complementary
methods to model sensory inputs for each of the three tasks). Each evolutionary
setup consisted of 30 independent evolutionary runs conducted in simulation. In each
simulation-based run, the evolutionary process optimised a population of 100
controllers for 100 generations. At each generation, a controllers performance was
given by the mean fitness of 10 simulations with varying conditions (e.g. randomised
initial position and orientation, amount of noise injected at every simulation step in
sensors and/or actuators). [...]
The post-evolution evaluation allows to obtain a more precise estimate of the relative
performance of the top controllers by evaluating them in a larger number of
simulations, and then to identify the highest-performing controller of each setup (to
be transferred to real robots) with potentially lower error margin.
2. On page 6 how does a robot itself measure pt?
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>The robot itself measures the p_t component of Equation 2.2 based on a
built-in procedure that maps the ground sensors readings to a value between zero
(target area not in range) and one (robot is in the target area), as described in the
first paragraph of Section 2 (c).
3. On page section on fault injection experiments, I suggest you reference prior work
nvestigating fault tolerance in swarms, i.e. Bjerknes and Winfield (2013) On fault tolerance
and scalability of swarm robotic systems. Distributed Autonomous Robotic Systems: The
10th International Symposium. (83) Springer, pp. 431-444.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>As suggested by the reviewer, we now reference the contribution of Bjerknes
and Winfield (2013) when presenting the fault-injection experiments [Section 2 (e),
second paragraph]:
The ability to tolerate and/or actively overcome faults is essential for improving the
reliability of robot systems [18]. In the fault injection experiments, we [...]
4. On page 10, 11 section on evolution of collective behaviours, note that online evolution in
ODowd et al, (2014) The distributed co-evolution of an on-board simulator and controller for
swarm robot behaviours. Evolutionary Intelligence, 7 (2). pp. 95-106, took place in a similar
timeframe (1 hour) to the experiments of your paper.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>As suggested by the reviewer, we added the contribution of ODowd et al.
(2014) to the list of studies referenced in Section 3 (a) (iii):
[...] Previous studies involving multiple robots have been limited to individual tasks
such as phototaxis [25], dynamic phototaxis [3], foraging [26], <U+200B>and a combination of
foraging and phototaxis (robots can use a moving light source as an
environmental aid) in which controllers are evolved in an onboard simulator
[27].<U+200B>
It should also be noted that we have revised the section according to the suggestions
put forth by the other reviewers to clarify that the focus of the section is on the
evolution of collectively coordinated behaviours, instead of the time-frame.
5. Re page 14 open source data. I was disappointed that I was unable to access the data
ogs and source code. I would be especially keen to check that the data is properly
annotated to explain the data fields and structures. Also are any videos of sample
experiments included to illustrate the different experiments?
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>When we submitted the paper, we did not have access to a Dryad account.
We were then asked to submit the data to Dryad (which we submitted along with the
code), and received via email the information that reviewers would be given access
to a temporary url for reviewing the submission data.
We have now included videos in the material submitted to Dryad.

Reviewer #2
Comments to the Author(s)
Thank you for the changes. The paper has been significantly improved, but I still
have a few requests.
First, I still do not understand why the results are presented as "percentage of
successful evaluations in one hour": once we have a successful controller, the
adaptation is done and we can use this good controller. As a consequence, what
matters more is "how much time (how many evaluations) do I need to solve the
task?"
<U+25CF> Reply: One of the aspects we have studied in our contribution is whether or not
robots can learn to solve different classes of tasks within a time-frame of one hour or
less. While the number of evaluations required to synthesise <U+200B>one <U+200B>instance of
collective behaviour, as suggested by the reviewer, is an interesting metric, the
percentage of successful evaluations in a given run provides a more consistent
metric regarding the robots ability to learn and adapt. We have improved the first
paragraph of Section 2(f) to address the reviewers comment (emphasis added):
We compare results along three dimensions: (i) fitness, that is, the performance or
quality of a controller, <U+200B>(ii) percentage of successful controller evaluations per
experiment<U+200B>, and (iii) behaviour distance, that is, how distinct the actions performed
during task execution by one or more reference controllers are with respect to the
actions performed by other controllers. <U+200B>As robots are repositioned from one
evaluation to the next, the percentage of successful evaluations is a more
consistent metric than the traditional number of evaluations until the first
successful controller evaluation, thus providing more accurate indications of
the ability of robots to learn and adapt.<U+200B>
Moreover, I do not understand why the "real samples" treatment seems to perform
well in Fig.S1, but in the text the differences between the three treatments are not
significant (3.a.ii, line 43). In addition, the success rates should be presented in a
table or a figure.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>Please note that the results presented in Fig. S1 refer to the
performance of the controllers <U+200B>in simulation<U+200B>, before online evolution in real
robots is conducted. In the main article, the portion of the article indicated by
the reviewer (Section 3.a.ii, line 43) refers to real-robot experiments. The fact
that a given method leads to higher-performing controllers in simulation does
not necessarily mean that such controllers will: (a) maintain similar
performance levels in real robotic hardware, and (ii) enable evolution to
synthesise higher-performing controllers in real robotic hardware.
We have rephrased the second paragraph of Text S1 to clarify the point
above (emphasis added):
<U+200B>The results of the simulation-based experiments, namely the fitness
trajectories and the post-evolution evaluation fitness scores are shown in Fig.
S1.[...]
Second, it should be clear in the abstract and conclusion if seeding from simulation
is helping or not. It seems to be useful for the first task, I do not know for the second
task, and useless for the third task.
<U+25CF> Reply: I<U+200B> n the abstract and conclusions, we now clarify that:
[...] Results show that more accurate simulations may lead to higher-performing
controllers, and that completing the optimisation process in real robots is meaningful,
even if solutions found in simulation differ from solutions in reality. [...] (abstract),
and that
[...] Results showed (i) that the fidelity of the simulation imposes different types of
constraints on online evolution in real robots, (ii) that more accurate simulations may
lead to higher-performing controllers, and that (iii) completing the optimisation
process in real robots is an effective approach, even if solutions found in simulation
differ from solutions in reality. [...] (conclusions)
Last, I still disagree with the sentence (in abstract and conclusion): "... one key
enabler [...] is a high-performance approach called odNEAT". It should be something
like "all the components of the evolutionary algorithm used in this study (odNEAT)
contribute to the performance of the algorithm" (or something along this line: the
author do not show that odNEAT is superior to any competing approach, even if
odNEAT without some components is close to some alternative approaches.
<U+25CF> Reply: We have rephrased the abstract and the conclusions to address
the reviewers comments:
In the abstract: <U+200B>[...] We conclude by assessing the contribution of each
algorithmic component on the performance of the underlying evolutionary
algorithm.
In the conclusions: <U+200B>[...] To conclude, we showed that each of the main
algorithmic components of odNEAT contributes to the algorithm's performance.
Minor requests:

<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>The source code of the experiments is available on Dryad, see the
Data accessibility section of the article (emphasis added):

- I did not find the parameters of odNEAT (in particular, the number of robots and all
the NEAT parameters)
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>The number of robots in listed in the introduction and in the
experiments section. In the supplementary material, we have added a new
section called Configuration of odNEAT that includes the main parameters of
odNEAT. The parameters can additionally be found in the source code.
- In the supplementaries, the authors should not use means (table S1) but medians,
to be consistent with the Mann-Whitney test and the boxplots.
<U+25CF> Reply: <U+200B>We have added a new column to Table S1 in which we report the
median performance of controllers when transferred from simulation to real
robots.
- Fig S1(A) and S1(B) have inconsistent colors
