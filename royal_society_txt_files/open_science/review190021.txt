This manuscript presents a nice common garden experiment involving salmon of three see-ages,
which allows testing the effect of strain and age on a male secondary sexual trait: kype. The
experimental setup is adapted, although several domesticated strains would have increased its
power and biological significance. The manuscript is concise and easy to read, and the
illustrations are nice. I have concerns about neither ethics nor sharing of data and analysis code.
However, I have the feeling that the statistical analysis, although quite sound as it is, could be
improved, to fit the goal of the manuscript more closely, and to strengthen the discussion.
Especially, since the main scope (according to the title) is to test the effect of age and
domestication, why not include strain type (wild, domesticated or hybrid) in the mixed model,
with strain nested in it? Instead, you performed all pairwise comparisons, a few of which actually
making sense for your initial question.
For AKL, two significant contrasts go in the unexpected direction (Arna<Domesticated and
Arna<MF). You discuss this as being a possible artefact due to the correlation of kype length with
fork length, which your adjustment method may have failed to remove. This made me look for
possibly better ways to account for allometry in your data. I guess you pooled all individuals
from all groups in the log-log linear regressions of fork length and kype length (height), from
which you take the residuals as adjusted kype length (height). However, the factors included in
the subsequent LME (strain, age…) could affect fork length, kype length(height), and the
allometric coefficient between both. Wouldn’t it be interesting to use the approach proposed by
Nakagawa et al.(https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-017-0448-5), and include fork length as a
covariable in the LME? Using a model like their Eqn. 8, you would be able to account for different
slopes of log(FL) on log(KL) for the different groups (strains, age…). But maybe this suggestion,
in addition to the previous one, would result in an overparametrized model.
More specific comments.
- Could you tell what criteria are used to select spawners in salmon farming? Could they be
selected on traits that are indirectly linked to kype length or height?
- L110, 126: the fish matured at sea and were sampled there, right? You sampled them at the end
of the spawning season, but they haven't spawned. Is it possible that some of them started then to
resorb their kype, as it has been documented in kelts (doi: 10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00239.x)?
- L131: I guess you measured fork length from the tip of the maxillary (not the mandible). Please
make this explicit, so that readers understand fork length does not include kype.
L177: is there a prediction for the relationship between GSR and kype characteristics?
L270: the "1" after "haplotype" has disappeared.
L279: write "in addition" instead of "in additional".

Perry et al- evolutionary drivers of kype size
Perry et al have conducted an elegant experiment that takes advantage of time gone by since
selection of specific stocks for Atlantic salmon aquaculture. Given that modern aquaculture
breeding practices likely have relaxed specific selection for secondary sexual characteristics, they
test whether male kype size (height and length) have diminished over ~12 generations. The
work is really quite similar in concept to female selection for male tail length in swordfish and
widowbirds- but more difficult to test experimentally since unlike tails- it is harder to
manipulate the size of the kype. They provide some discussion as to the function of the kype-
whether it provides some mechanical value in formal male-male conflict or is purely ornamental
driven by female choice remains uncertain.
For the experiment- they make an effort to compare the stocks from the same historical rivers to
minimize selection that might happen from breeding in different rivers and habitat types-
something that is well established in pacific salmon- particularly sockeye. I have minimal
concerns with the manuscript. The results are fairly unsurprising (to my preconceived opinions
at least). I suspect some reviewers would argue for large family groups to better control for
strong family bias’s or traits but I have little doubt results would differ. For the discussion
section ‘ecological implications and further research’- I agree with the literature that given a
range of mate choices- kype height does seem to play a role in male selection for salmon and
influences success at a behavioral level. However from a management perspective focused on
recovering natural populations of Atlantic salmon- I do not see evidence that kype size is directly
linked to population viability- and that, at least for this trait if a bunch of small kyped males
were used to recover a population- mate choice would likely ‘re-evolve’ increased kype heights
over multiple generations. An implied point of the authors is that likely other traits that might be
affecting population recovery might also be ‘degrading’ through artificial selection and these
characteristics when interbred into wild populations could have negative effects. It is identifying
these critical traits where I propose future research should be directed.
I have a few minor comments for various sections and will detail them below relative to specific
line numbers in the paper.

115- please provide additional details to methods- a) the reader presumes that for the wild
breedings in this experiment- the wild fish were not allowed to ‘mate select’ themselves, but
rather were subjected to same eggs and sperm in a cup and selected by humans? B) how was
selection of wild fish controlled for to prevent any bias such for particularly large kypes either in
the field or by human choice in the hatchery?
209-212- I follow your logic in assigning these fish to ‘female’ but it would seem that if they are
expressing milt- that is a primary sex characteristic- not a secondary one- and as such one might
be inclined to identify them as males instead? Given it was equal across all three groups I doubt
the assignment to either sex effects the results.
253-255- are you basically arguing that kype length is not relevant to the differences in male and
female head morphology?
279- change additional to addition?
314-315- I suspect you are correct but could a third potential (and less likely) explanation be that
insufficient variation of this trait existed in the original brood stock for relaxed selection to show
a measureable change over only 12 generations?
315-316- again- I am inclined to agree with your argument- but can you fully rule out that kype
length and forklength correlation is not a function of some form of genetic linkage?
345-347- would another way of saying this be that kype height is of secondary importance in
female mate choice compared to total body size?
361-363- Im a little unsure the authors mean by ‘but also the size of their kype’. I only see
evidence in the literature for kype size just having behavioral shifts in selection preference?
366-367- So.. wild females really select for total male size potentially as a highest priority?

RSOS-190021 – Evolutionary drivers of kype size in Atlantic
salmon (Salmo salar): domestication, age and genetics
Comments to authors
This paper investigates changes in a secondary sex characteristic
(kype) associated with domestication in Atlantic salmon. The study
compares kype traits (length and height) in wild, domestic, and hybrid
strains of salmon reared under common garden conditions. The study
finds differences between strains and age-at-maturity in kype traits.
Specifically, the study finds that adjusted kype height is significantly
lower in domestic salmon, suggesting a role for relaxed sexual
selection associated with domestication. The study identifies some loci
that are possibly associated with kype traits. In addition, the study also
compares head morphology using geometric morphometrics, and
generally finds differences between sexes and ages that are not
associated with domestication. This last point (Geometric
morphometrics analysis) is not addressed in the Discussion and
warrants at least a sentence or two. The study should also better define
the purpose/objective of this analysis in the paper.
Overall the paper reads well and addresses some important issues
relating to domestication. My primary concern is the difference found
between adjusted kype height (AKH) and adjusted kype length (AKL).
AKH is significantly lower in domestic fish relative to wild,
supporting the conclusion “that the relaxation of sexual-selection
during nearly fifty years selective breeding has driven shifts in kype
structure in domesticated Atlantic salmon” (Lines 288-289). However,
the paper also finds that AKL is different between strains (p < 0.01),
where domestic fish have the greater AKL (albeit posthoc pairwise
comparisons were not significant). This is not clearly explained in the
same part of the discussion (Line 288-289) or in the Abstract (Line
30). The authors suggest that AKL is “is not important in sexual
selection, or it is indirectly selected for in the domestication process”
(Line 314-315). The authors also suggest there is little genetic
variation for AKL trait because kype length is highly correlated with
body length (more so than KH); but R2 for both traits with body length
is very high (R2 = 0.87 and 0.81). However, the authors find the
“presence of loci that control kype length independently from fork
length” (Line 325-326). This seems to suggest that there is genetic
variation associated with kype length, and more so than AKH (where
no QTLs were found). I think this part of the paper needs some
revising to provide better interpretation of the results. Is it also
possible that this trait AKL is not really representative of the kype but
rather just the length of the lower jaw, regardless of whether the
individual has a kype or not. This is an important consideration that
should be addressed. This would allow future mate choice or other
studies to focus on the important trait.
In addition, would it be possible to score individuals in a more binary
way for presence or absence of a kype? Or potentially a “kype index”
ranging from 0 (no kype) to 5 (full kype) and allowing for
intermediates? From the photographs provided, it seems that
something like that may be possible and it would be interesting to
explore this relationship, particularly for the genetic analyses.
Aside from these concerns, my only other major comment is that more
information is needed for the QTL results. A Manhattan plot or table
would be useful. If other studies examine QTLs for kype traits in the
future, then it is important to know where these QTLs are located for
comparison. Further, it would be helpful to know how much variation
can be explained by the QTL.
Specific comments:
Abstract
Lines 22-25 – This sentence should be revised. Not clear.
Line 30 – Worth mentioning that the same relationship was not found
for AKL, in fact, AKL was greater in domestic strain compared to the
wild strain.
Introduction - Overall the introduction provides great context for the
study and reads well.
Line 52 – include (i.e., nests) for non-salmonid readers.
Lines 96-100 – No mention of genetic analyses in this section?
Methods - The methods are generally clear and analyses outlined
appear to be appropriate and statically sound.
Line 109 – If strains are mixed at the eyed-egg stage, how is their
origin known?
Line 126 – Was this the first time that each male matured? Could they
have spawned previously provided that Atlantic salmon are
iteroparous?
Line 140 – What was the origin of the females? What were their ages?
Line 196-198 – There are many factors in the model. Could the model
be over correcting (accounting for) for real variation associated with
the trait, thus reducing the power to detect true QTL?
Line 227 – Authors should make it clear that AKL is actually larger in
domestic strain. Reword to indicate that AKL was greater in
domesticated compared to Arna (similar to wording indicated in the
AKH comparison; Line 238)
Line 255 – Is this worded correctly? Should it say “does not constitute
female head morphology”?
Line 257 – What is causing the separation between 1/2SW and 3SW
fish?
Lines 261-272 – Please include figure (Manhattan plot) for these QTL
analyses. Or at least a table of genomic position of these SNPs. How
much variation can be explained by genotype?
Line 270 – Missing haplotype “1” here?
Line 288 – It may be appropriate to indicate that adjusted kype length
was actually larger in domestic strain here. Or to provide some
information about the lack of difference in AKL.
Line 305-306 - This sentence is a bit misleading. Perhaps it would be
more appropriate to end this section (at the end of these few
paragraphs) with this sentence/thought, and to indicate specifically that
it is AKH (not AKL) that is important for sexual selection.
Line 311-312 – This is a bit confusing, as AKL was significantly
different between strains (p < 0.01) (Domestic and Arna, p =
0.02)(Arna and hybrid MF, p = 0.03)? I think the posthoc pairwise
comparisons were not significant, but if that is true, these p-values
associated with pairwise comparisons are not useful. Please clarify.
Line 314-315 – Why might these traits be under different selective
pressure? Are there potential reasons why kype height may be more
important for sexual selection? I think this would be interesting to
consider.
Line 325 – Maybe I have missed something, but the authors argue that
there is little genetic variation for kype length (line 316-317), but then
show that there are loci that control kype length independent of fork
length (Line 325-326). This is confusing and this part of the discussion
should be revised. It would also be useful as indicated in the Results to
know how much variation can be explained by these loci.
Line 339-352 – It would be useful here to review the evidence on kype
characteristics and sexual selection. What has been found previously?

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript presents a nice common garden experiment involving salmon of three see-
ages, which allows testing the effect of strain and age on a male secondary sexual trait: kype.
The experimental setup is adapted, although several domesticated strains would have
increased its power and biological significance. The manuscript is concise and easy to read,
and the illustrations are nice. I have concerns about neither ethics nor sharing of data and
analysis code.
However, I have the feeling that the statistical analysis, although quite sound as it is, could be
improved, to fit the goal of the manuscript more closely, and to strengthen the discussion.
Especially, since the main scope (according to the title) is to test the effect of age and
domestication, why not include strain type (wild, domesticated or hybrid) in the mixed
model, with strain nested in it? Instead, you performed all pairwise comparisons, a few of
which actually making sense for your initial question.
For AKL, two significant contrasts go in the unexpected direction (Arna<Domesticated and
Arna<MF). You discuss this as being a possible artefact due to the correlation of kype length
with fork length, which your adjustment method may have failed to remove. This made me
look for possibly better ways to account for allometry in your data. I guess you pooled all
individuals from all groups in the log-log linear regressions of fork length and kype length
(height), from which you take the residuals as adjusted kype length (height). However, the
factors included in the subsequent LME (strain, age…) could affect fork length, kype
length(height), and the allometric coefficient between both. Wouldn’t it be interesting to use
the approach proposed by Nakagawa et al.(https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-017-0448-5), and
include fork length as a covariable in the LME? Using a model like their Eqn. 8, you would
be able to account for different slopes of log(FL) on log(KL) for the different groups (strains,
age…). But maybe this suggestion, in addition to the previous one, would result in an
overparametrized model.
Response: Thank you very much for your insightful comments, and constructive
feedback. Please find my response to your main points:
1. Using type (wild, farmed, hybrid) with strain nested – This is a very good point,
and it is something that I had included in the first models, and unsurprisingly, it
showed that there was a difference between the types. However, after some
discussion, we decided that it would be more honest to simply show strain, as not
to whitewash over the ‘non-significant to P < 0.05’ difference between the
domesticated strain and Vosso.
2. Controlling for allometry was probably one of the biggest challenges we had in
the analysis, with us finally settling (like you describe) with a log regression
between the kype length and fork length among all individuals, avoiding
divisions due to the statistical problems highlighted by Nakagawa et al. As for
including fork length as a covariate in the model, I think you are also right about
the overparameterization. I have consulted the authors Alain F. Zuur and Elena
N. Ieno of the book ‘Mixed Effects Models and Extensions in Ecology with R’
(DOI: 10.1007/978-0-387-87458-6). They too suggested that feeding an
appropriate size adjusted metric for kype length, like residuals from a regression
would be the best way forward, as mixed effect models do not deal well with
strongly correlated covariates. The paper by Nakagawa et al. is very informative,
however, and I will certainly bear this in mind for future work.
More specific comments.
- Could you tell what criteria are used to select spawners in salmon farming? Could they be
selected on traits that are indirectly linked to kype length or height?
Response: Breeding programs will select for things such as body size, delayed
maturation, high survival, and tempered stress response. I would say that there might
be an indirect link between kype length and body size, but I think if we were to see that
there was an indirect link here with kype height, we would not be seeing a reduction in
the domesticated individuals.
- L110, 126: the fish matured at sea and were sampled there, right? You sampled them at the
end of the spawning season, but they haven't spawned. Is it possible that some of them started
then to resorb their kype, as it has been documented in kelts (doi: 10.1046/j.1469-
7580.2003.00239.x)?
Response: Although there are observations of kype resorption of the kype in Atlantic
salmon, the extent of this is unknown. The study by Witten at el. (2003) you refer to
summarises that from their work: “our present observations neither support
suggestions of periodic return of the lower jaw to its previous shape”. Even though
there may be evidence for demineralisation, this may not equate to a change in size. As
we looked at the kype in a common garden setting, resorption, if it were to happen,
should have occurred at the same time across strains. The males from different sea
winters were also terminated at roughly the same time each year (10 days apart, max). I
should also imagine that there are a variety of cues that would trigger reabsorption
other than time of year, such as a move to freshwater, which was not present in the
conditions these fish were reared in.
- L131: I guess you measured fork length from the tip of the maxillary (not the mandible).
Please make this explicit, so that readers understand fork length does not include kype.
Response: Addition of “most anterior point of the head to the of the middle caudal fin
rays”
L177: is there a prediction for the relationship between GSR and kype characteristics?
Response: GSR was not a significant term in the model. We did see a positive
relationship between AKH and gonadosomatic index (GSI - GSI = [gonad weight / total
tissue weight] × 100), but this was likely due to the fact that allometry was not properly
adjusted for by this metric.
L270: the "1" after "haplotype" has disappeared.
Response: Fixed
L279: write "in addition" instead of "in additional".
Response: Fixed

Comments to the Author(s)
Perry et al- evolutionary drivers of kype size
Perry et al have conducted an elegant experiment that takes advantage of time gone by since
selection of specific stocks for Atlantic salmon aquaculture. Given that modern aquaculture
breeding practices likely have relaxed specific selection for secondary sexual characteristics,
they test whether male kype size (height and length) have diminished over ~12 generations.
The work is really quite similar in concept to female selection for male tail length in
swordfish and widowbirds- but more difficult to test experimentally since unlike tails- it is
harder to manipulate the size of the kype. They provide some discussion as to the function
of the kype- whether it provides some mechanical value in formal male-male conflict or is
purely ornamental driven by female choice remains uncertain.
For the experiment- they make an effort to compare the stocks from the same historical rivers
to minimize selection that might happen from breeding in different rivers and habitat types-
something that is well established in pacific salmon- particularly sockeye. I have minimal
concerns with the manuscript. The results are fairly unsurprising (to my preconceived
opinions at least). I suspect some reviewers would argue for large family groups to better
control for strong family bias’s or traits but I have little doubt results would differ. For the
discussion section ‘ecological implications and further research’- I agree with the literature
that given a range of mate choices- kype height does seem to play a role in male selection for
salmon and influences success at a behavioral level. However from a management
perspective focused on recovering natural populations of Atlantic salmon- I do not see
evidence that kype size is directly linked to population viability- and that, at least for this trait
if a bunch of small kyped males were used to recover a population- mate choice would likely
‘re-evolve’ increased kype heights over multiple generations. An implied point of the authors
is that likely other traits that might be affecting population recovery might also be
‘degrading’ through artificial selection and these characteristics when interbred into wild
populations could have negative effects. It is identifying these critical traits where I propose
future research should be directed.
I have a few minor comments for various sections and will detail them below relative to
specific line numbers in the paper.
Response: Thank you for your kind comments and constructive feedback. Please find
my response to your main points:
I would agree that kype size is not going to be the key determinant of the viability of a
river. I also agree that if a haplotype for a small kype were to spread through the
population, if all of that population then had small kypes, mate choice would just ‘re-
evolve’.
I do think, however, that the kype could be part of why we see farmed escapees being
less competitive, and because we see an intermediate kype phenotype in hybrids, this
could also be related to their fitness. As salmon populations are highly structured
genetically and physically, it would not be un-thinkable that unfavourable haplotypes,
such as those for smaller kype size, could build up in areas of high escapees, perhaps
causing isolation from larger populations, and contributing to a spiral of decline
(associated with a myriad of other typically introgressed phenotypes, and human
pressures).
Line #-comment
43- I suspect this might be a US English for GB English issue- but should manifest have ED
on the end?
Response: Fixed
49- similarly- varied to- variation?
Response: Fixed
115- please provide additional details to methods- a) the reader presumes that for the wild
breedings in this experiment- the wild fish were not allowed to ‘mate select’ themselves, but
rather were subjected to same eggs and sperm in a cup and selected by humans? B) how was
selection of wild fish controlled for to prevent any bias such for particularly large kypes
either in the field or by human choice in the hatchery?
Response to A: Addition of “Artificial fertilisation of gametes took place on arrival at
the IMR Matre Research station”
Response to B: Wild parents were caught by angling (Figgjo, Vosso), nets (Vosso) or
salmon trap. Farmed parents were chosen at ‘random’ from the breeding station at
Askøy. This information is included in “Solberg et al. (2014) (information on the cohort
produced in 2012)”. I have tried to highlight what information can be found in Solberg
et al. (2014) a bit better in the methods.
209-212- I follow your logic in assigning these fish to ‘female’ but it would seem that if
they are expressing milt- that is a primary sex characteristic- not a secondary one- and as
such one might be inclined to identify them as males instead? Given it was equal across all
three groups I doubt the assignment to either sex effects the results.
Response: I did run the analysis both with and without these individuals, and like you
say, it made no difference.
253-255- are you basically arguing that kype length is not relevant to the differences in male
and female head morphology?
Response: Apologies – should read does NOT constitute!
279- change additional to addition?
Response: Fixed
314-315- I suspect you are correct but could a third potential (and less likely) explanation be
that insufficient variation of this trait existed in the original brood stock for relaxed selection
to show a measureable change over only 12 generations?
Response: Fish from many rivers were used in the origin of the Mowi strain, so I should
think that there would have been variation in this trait.
315-316- again- I am inclined to agree with your argument- but can you fully rule out that
kype length and forklength correlation is not a function of some form of genetic linkage?
Response: Addition of “Additionally, there could also be possible genetic linkage
between traits under selection (e.g. fork length) and kype length”.
345-347- would another way of saying this be that kype height is of secondary importance in
female mate choice compared to total body size?
Response: Yes, see addition of “; this would assume that kype size is of secondary
importance, after body size, in competing for females, if the males are an order of
magnitude larger than their conspecifics.”
361-363- Im a little unsure the authors mean by ‘but also the size of their kype’. I only see
evidence in the literature for kype size just having behavioral shifts in selection preference?
Response: Sentence clarified
366-367- So.. wild females really select for total male size potentially as a highest priority?
Response: Quite possibly. Jarvi (1990) did show that males with a larger body size also
increased in dominance rank. One experimental problem that I think Javi had was
separating the effects of body size and kype size, due to allometry – this is why I think
experiments in manipulating kype size might be of interest in getting to the bottom of
which is more important. Like you say in your comments about swordfish and
widowbirds studies, however, trying to manipulate the kype would be a bit of a battle!
Reviewer 3:
This paper investigates changes in a secondary sex characteristic (kype) associated with
domestication in Atlantic salmon. The study compares kype traits (length and height) in
wild, domestic, and hybrid strains of salmon reared under common garden conditions.
The study finds differences between strains and age-at-maturity in kype traits.
Specifically, the study finds that adjusted kype height is significantly lower in domestic
salmon, suggesting a role for relaxed sexual selection associated with domestication. The
study identifies some loci that are possibly associated with kype traits. In addition, the
study also compares head morphology using geometric morphometrics, and generally
finds differences between sexes and ages that are not associated with domestication. This
last point (Geometric morphometrics analysis) is not addressed in the Discussion and
warrants at least a sentence or two. The study should also better define the
purpose/objective of this analysis in the paper.
Overall the paper reads well and addresses some important issues relating to
domestication. My primary concern is the difference found between adjusted kype height
(AKH) and adjusted kype length (AKL). AKH is significantly lower in domestic fish
relative to wild, supporting the conclusion “that the relaxation of sexual-selection during
nearly fifty years selective breeding has driven shifts in kype structure in domesticated
Atlantic salmon” (Lines 288-289). However, the paper also finds that AKL is different
between strains (p < 0.01), where domestic fish have the greater AKL (albeit posthoc
pairwise comparisons were not significant). This is not clearly explained in the same part
of the discussion (Line 288-289) or in the Abstract (Line 30). The authors suggest that
AKL is “is not important in sexual selection, or it is indirectly selected for in the
domestication process” (Line 314-315). The authors also suggest there is little genetic
variation for AKL trait because kype length is highly correlated with body length (more
so than KH); but R2 for both traits with body length is very high (R2 = 0.87 and 0.81).
However, the authors find the “presence of loci that control kype length independently
from fork length” (Line 325-326). This seems to suggest that there is genetic variation
associated with kype length, and more so than AKH (where no QTLs were found). I think
this part of the paper needs some revising to provide better interpretation of the results. Is
it also possible that this trait AKL is not really representative of the kype but rather just
the length of the lower jaw, regardless of whether the individual has a kype or not. This is
an important consideration that should be addressed. This would allow future mate choice
or other studies to focus on the important trait.
In addition, would it be possible to score individuals in a more binary way for presence or
absence of a kype? Or potentially a “kype index” ranging from 0 (no kype) to 5 (full
kype) and allowing for intermediates? From the photographs provided, it seems that
something like that may be possible and it would be interesting to explore this
relationship, particularly for the genetic analyses.
Aside from these concerns, my only other major comment is that more information is
needed for the QTL results. A Manhattan plot or table would be useful. If other studies
examine QTLs for kype traits in the future, then it is important to know where these
QTLs are located for comparison. Further, it would be helpful to know how much
variation can be explained by the QTL.
Response:
Thank you very much for your comprehensive engagement with all aspects of the
paper, your clear suggestions and constructive feedback. Please find my responses to
the themes you showed concern over:
1. No mention of geometric morphometrics in the discussion: This is a good point,
addition of “The reduced kype height trait identified here was not female
mimicry, as highlighted by the geometric morphometric analysis, which showed
clear head shape separation between female and male fish of all ages and
strains”
2. Scoring individuals on kype size: We did try to sort individuals into a kype index
(0-5) like you suggest, and even into groups such as ‘kype’ and ‘no kype’.
However, after looking through a number of individuals, it was clear that this
was quite an ambiguous task, because of the continuum of sizes you encounter.
We decided not to try and plough on ahead doing this for all 528 fish, and
instead focused on kype height and kype length.
3. Increased AKL in domesticated individuals: I agree that the results surrounding
AKL are a bit confused, and I think it reflects the confusion we had when first
interpreting he results. I agree that both kype height and kype length are highly
correlated with fork length. I also agree that the results from the QTL are also
the opposite of what you might find with the argument we made regarding little
genetic variation for kype length. I have reconstructed this section of the
discussion, further talking about biological processes that may have caused the
results we see, but also including the methodological artefacts that could have
also contributed (removing the little genetic variation comments). Finally ending,
in what I think is the real take home message, that kype length is not important
in sexual selection. I have emphasised the results of the AKL in the abstract. I
have also added that future studies should focus on kype height rather than kype
length in the ‘future research’ section. I hope this makes everything a bit clearer.
4. More information needed on QTL: Manhattan plot included in the
supplementary materials, and variation explained by QTL for AKH and AKL
was added to the results.
Specific comments:
Abstract
Lines 22-25 – This sentence should be revised. Not clear.
Response: Fixed
Line 30 – Worth mentioning that the same relationship was not found for AKL, in fact,
AKL was greater in domestic strain compared to the wild strain.
Response: Addition of “Fork length-adjusted kype length showed an increase in
domesticated individuals, highlighting that kype length, as it is defined here, may not be
an important in cue mate choice.”
Line 52 – include (i.e., nests) for non-salmonid readers.
Response: Fixed
Lines 96-100 – No mention of genetic analyses in this section?
Response: Addition of “alongside a quantitative trait loci analysis”
Line 109 – If strains are mixed at the eyed-egg stage, how is their origin known?
Response: A fin clip is taken from the fish and a pit tag is inserted, the PIT tag is then
scanned when the fish has been terminated, allowing us to match the fish with the
results from the parentage analysis performed on DNA from the finclip: “Procedures
included DNA identification and subsequent PIT tagging of all individuals for
identification.”
Line 126 – Was this the first time that each male matured? Could they have spawned
previously provided that Atlantic salmon are iteroparous?
Response:
Line 140 – What was the origin of the females? What were their ages?
Response: Please see table 1
Line 196-198 – There are many factors in the model. Could the model be over correcting
(accounting for) for real variation associated with the trait, thus reducing the power to
detect true QTL?
Response: The covariates included in the model only account for about 12% of the
phenotype variation (Adjusted kype length) which means the 88% of the variation is
still available in the model to fit QTL effects. The covariates in the model do not seem to
be an obstacle to the detection of QTL due to soaking the available phenotypic
variance.
Line 227 – Authors should make it clear that AKL is actually larger in domestic strain.
Reword to indicate that AKL was greater in domesticated compared to Arna (similar to
wording indicated in the AKH comparison; Line 238)
Response: Addition of “The difference in AKL among strains was driven by the
significantly larger AKL in the domesticated strain (estimated mean = 0.012) when
compared to Arna (estimated mean = - 0.022)”
Line 255 – Is this worded correctly? Should it say “does not constitute female head
morphology”?
Response: Fixed
Line 257 – What is causing the separation between 1/2SW and 3SW fish?
Response: Addition of “The differences in male head shape between sea winters was
summarised along PC1 (Proportion of variance = 46.5 %) and was characterised by a
dorsal shift of features such as the eye, posterior point of the gill plate and the maxillary
bone (supplementary figure 3).” And addition analysis which is contained in
supplementary materials.
Lines 261-272 – Please include figure (Manhattan plot) for these QTL analyses. Or at
least a table of genomic position of these SNPs. How much variation can be explained by
genotype?
Response: Please see the addition of QTL plot in the supplementary materials, and
references within the QTL results. Also, the addition of “Estimated relative proportion
of QTL variance attributed to AKL from the Hierarchical Generalized Linear Model
(HGLM) was 5.0 %.” and “Estimated relative proportion of QTL variance attributed to
KH from the HGLM was 6.6 %.”
Line 270 – Missing haplotype “1” here?
Response: Fixed
Line 288 – It may be appropriate to indicate that adjusted kype length was actually larger
in domestic strain here. Or to provide some information about the lack of difference in
AKL.
Response: Addition of “We also found a significant increase in fork-length adjusted
kype length in the domesticated and hybrid MF strain when compared to the wild Arna
strain, suggesting that the length of the lower jaw, or kype length here, is not an
important feature in sexual selection.”
Line 305-306 - This sentence is a bit misleading. Perhaps it would be more appropriate
to end this section (at the end of these few paragraphs) with this sentence/thought, and to
indicate specifically that it is AKH (not AKL) that is important for sexual selection.
Response: Sentence clarified “It also provides further evidence of the kype’s importance
in sexual selection, specifically kype height, and the likely energetic cost of producing a
larger kype heights [2,37], which has resulted in its reduction within an aquaculture
setting”
Line 311-312 – This is a bit confusing, as AKL was significantly different between
strains (p < 0.01) (Domestic and Arna, p = 0.02)(Arna and hybrid MF, p = 0.03)? I think
the posthoc pairwise comparisons were not significant, but if that is true, these p-values
associated with pairwise comparisons are not useful. Please clarify.
Response: Amended, confused sentence removed.
Line 314-315 – Why might these traits be under different selective pressure? Are there
potential reasons why kype height may be more important for sexual selection? I think
this would be interesting to consider.
Response: Addition of “For example, kype length could be more important in male-
male competition, rather than in direct female mate choice. Male-male competition may
still be present in aquaculture with individuals competing for feed [46] instead of
females; therefore, kype length could still be selected for, while kype height would not.
Additionally, there could also be possible genetic linkage between traits under selection
(e.g. fork length) and kype length. What must also be highlighted, however, is that the
prediction of significantly smaller AKL in wild strains was only seen in Arna, and not
Vosso or Figgjo when compared to the domesticated strain.”
Line 325 – Maybe I have missed something, but the authors argue that there is little
genetic variation for kype length (line 316-317), but then show that there are loci that
control kype length independent of fork length (Line 325-326). This is confusing and this
part of the discussion should be revised. It would also be useful as indicated in the
Results to know how much variation can be explained by these loci.
Response: The correlation between genotype and phenotype is only significant in one or
two families which is where the QTL signal comes from.
Line 339-352 – It would be useful here to review the evidence on kype characteristics
and sexual selection. What has been found previously?
Response: Addition of “ Finally, integrating measures of sexually selected traits, such as
the kype, into life-history and survival datasets would provide further insights into how
sexual selection operates in Atlantic salmon. What is clear, however, is that there is very
little empirical evidence regarding the kype’s role in sexual selection, and there are a
multitude of ways in which we can build on the previous literature that has tried to
elucidate its role [12].” – there is not much out there on Atlantic salmon kypes past that
1990 study conducted by Javi. The other studies on the kype focus on it structure.
