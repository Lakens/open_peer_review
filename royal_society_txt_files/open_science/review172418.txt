The authors use four populations of the variable Zn hyperaccumulator N. caerulescens. They
grow these at different Zn concentrations and measure a number of parameters connected to
bacterial disease resistance. They include some mutant disease strains so they can evaluate the
importance of Zn sensitivity to the ability of bacteria to attack these plants. The authors find a
fairly complex story, in which the plants vary in several traits that relate to disease resistance.
I think the research is well done and the manuscript is well written. The authors do a good job
with experimental design and execution, and provide reasonable explanations for their results. I
particularly like their flow-chart model of the factors involved (Fig. 5) and think it helps to
provide a big picture summary of their findings. I found only a few minor items that might be
modified in revision:
1) Lines 59-60: El Mehdawi et al. 2014 is cited in a sentence about the variability of N.
caerulescens from Europe. I don’t understand why, because the El Mehdawi paper deals with Se
hyperaccumulators from the western United States. Thus citing it seems out of place.
2) Lines 273-275: This single sentence paragraph reports a lack of correlation between
glucosinolates and bacterial inhibition. The reader is wondering what data are leading the
authors to that conclusion, as they do not refer us to any reported results. Was a correlation
analysis done?
3) Line 574: Delete “at.”
4) Line 643: Replace “replica” with “replicate.”

SUMMARY
The results are doubtful; their interpretation is incomplete, questionable and partial.
SPECIFIC COMMENTS
L10-11. “The metal hyperaccumulator plant Noccaea caerulescens uses metals as a defence
against pathogens”. This is not well established, in general, and in particular in this manuscript.
This is a hypothesis and should be presented as so.
L36. Ma et al, 2011 is not in the reference list.
L43-45. “Previously, we have shown that zinc hyperaccumulation by N. caerulescens is able to
restrict the growth of the common bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola
(Psm) through direct toxicity of the metal ion itself (Fones et al., 2010). We confirmed this by
using mutants of Psm with altered zinc tolerance, which showed corresponding changes in their
ability to grow in high-zinc plants.” It is not because Zn in plant is toxic to a bacteria (and in
particular to a Zn sensitive bacteria) put on the plant that the plant uses the metal for defence, i.e.
that Zn hyperaccumulation is an adaptive trait, with a defence role against bacteria, that is
maintained and has been evolved by natural selection.
L57-60. “N. caerulescens is a variable species (Escarré et al., 2000; Reeves et al., 2001) whose
European populations differ both in morphological and physiological features, including metal
hyperaccumulation (Lombi et al., 2000; Meerts et al., 2003; Dechamps et al., 2005, 2007, 2011; El
Mehdawi et al. 2014).” I am not sure that the reference to El Mehdawi, dealing with
“Symphyotrichum ericoides populations from seleniferous and nonseleniferous soil display
striking variation in selenium accumulation.” is relevant to a statement about N. caerulescens
phenotypical variability.
L61. Macnair et al. 1999 is not in the reference list.
L100-110. The aim of the article is not clear. Some phenomenon and variables are announced to
be investigated or studied, but the tested hypotheses are not clearly presented.
L114.121. Plants. The populations tested were not representative of the existing so-called ecotypes
and populations. The vast majority of N. caerulescens populations are non metallicolous (Besnard
et al. 2009; Gonneau et al. 2017). In this work, three metallicolous, i.e. calamine populations were
tested among four, that is only one non-metallicolous population was used.
L131. What is a technical replicate? Why measuring 6 of those for each sample? Have the authors
used certified reference materials?
Bacteria. What is the number of replicates?
I do not clearly see if the different experiments (bacteria, growth essay, cell death, glucosinolate
extraction) were carried on the same plant sets or on sets specific to each experiment.
L176-177. “Hartley, 1950; David, 1952” are not in the reference list.
L189-192. “At 30 and 300 µM zinc, Prayon plants accumulated the highest foliar concentrations
of zinc, whereas plants from Ganges (one of the most metal-tolerant populations of this species)
accumulated significantly less zinc than Prayon at these two treatment concentrations.” This
presentation of the results in Figure 1 is incomplete. It should also be said that at 30 and 300 µM
zinc, there is no difference between Ganges, Viviez and Wilwerwitz. It should also be said that at
10 µM there is no difference between the populations and that at 0.04 µM Prayon is similar to
Viviez and Ganges to Wilwerwitz.
Moreover, the ranking of the populations according to Zn accumulation was completely different
to that found by Sterckeman et al. (2017) who grew 60 populations in a soil containing nearly
4
1000 mg Zn kg-1. In their case, non-metallicolous populations generally concentrated much more
Zn than the calamine ones. In particular, they found 12908 mg Zn kg-1 in Wilwerwitz, 2871 mg
Zn kg-1 in Ganges, 2865 mg Zn kg-1 in Prayon and 2380 mg Zn kg-1 in Viviez (see their
supplementary material, Table S6). I wonder which of the rankings is the more representative of
the plants in the field. I would suggest that soil cultivation is closer to in situ conditions than
hydroponics carried out in this work.
L192-193. “In all four populations, treatment with up to 300 µM zinc caused no visible stress or
stunting, with plants showing neither visible chlorosis nor anthocyanin production”. Apparent
aspect is not sufficient to evaluate stress. At least root and shoot biomass, as well as root length
should have been measured.
L195-208. As far as I understand, the methods for the measurement of ROS, H2O2, superoxyde
were not presented in the Materials and Methods section. Why? I think they should be, even if
the figures are presented in supplementary materials.
L212. “Plants of the Prayon population showed little or no trypan blue staining if uninoculated,
and no significant response to mock inoculation, with small but significant levels of cell death in
response to Psm, particularly at low zinc concentrations.” It should be pointed out that there was
no significant response to Psm at 300 µM.
Figure 2: How to explain the significant effect of mock treatment for Viviez at 300 µM, while
control and Psm showed significantly less cell death?
L216-220. “By contrast, both Ganges and Wilwerwiltz plants showed high levels of cell death,
even in the absence of inoculation, if grown on low zinc. This is suggestive of a highly sensitive or
spontaneous cell-death response, which is suppressed when the plants are grown on high zinc. In
response to both mock and Psm inoculation, these plants showed extensive cell death, leading to
45- 50% of the leaf area being stained by trypan blue. Unlike the cell death response in Prayon
and Viviez plants, this response was not suppressed by zinc.”
Looking quickly at Figure 2, I could differentiate Ganges from Wilwerwitz as the latter shows a
higher response to Psm. However, I have several concerns about these results. Concerning
Ganges: Why is the response to the mock treatment similar or much higher to that of Psm at 0.04,
10, 30 and 300 µM? Why is the response to Psm so low to 30 µM while it is so higher at 10 µM and
at 300 µM? Concerning Wilwerwitz: Why is there a response to mock treatment at 0.04 µM
significantly higher than those of untreated and Psm? The standard errors in Figure 2 are often
very high. These remarks make me consider that the results in Figure 2 are not reliable enough.
L266. “The Ganges (Figure 4b) and Wilwerwiltz (Figure 4d) populations gave similar results to
each other.” I disagree with this statement. The maximum response in Wilwerwitz is around 1.6,
while it is around 12 in Ganges. There is roughly 5 times more bacterial cells in leaves of Ganges
than in those of Wilwerwitz.
L285-290. “Both of these possibilities are exemplified by the Prayon population, in which metal
hyperaccumulation has led to a constitutive loss of ROS-based defences (Fones et al., 2013), and
where high metal availability lessens the inducible glucosinolate and cell death responses. It may
not be coincidental that these trade-offs are most evident in the Prayon population, which
accumulates significantly higher concentrations of foliar zinc than the other populations in this
work.”
This argument is not convincing, as the difference in Zn accumulation between Prayon and the
other populations is not so pronounced: there is no significant difference at 0.04 µM and 10 µM
exposures; at 10 µM, Prayon is around 3000 mg kg-1 when the other populations are 2000 mg kg-
1; at 300 µM, Prayon is 7000 mg kg-1 when the other populations are 6000 mg kg-1. I am not
convinced that this difference in Zn accumulation would justify a trade-off to exist in Prayon and
not in the other populations. My doubt is reinforced by the fact that in soil cultivation, Prayon is
not the population which the more accumulates Zn.
L313-315. “The Viviez population, like Prayon, shows an apparent defensive trade-off between
zinc and pathogen-induced cell death (Figure 2). However, in this population, zinc and
glucosinolate concentrations are positively correlated (Figure 3).” It is not true, when looking at
Figure 3 (and at Figure 1), that Zn and glucosinolate concentrations are positively correlated in
5
the Viviez population, as there is no difference in glucosinolate content for 0.04, 10 and 300 µM
Zn exposures.
L331-332. “Both [Ganges and Wilwerwitz] populations show high glucosinolate concentrations,
particularly at high zinc, and a cell-death response that is positively correlated with zinc
accumulation.” From Figure 3, I cannot see more glucosinolate in Ganges and Wilwerwitz than in
Viviez. Taking each treatment separately, I do not see any positive correlation of cell death level
with Zn concentration, except may-be for mock treatment in Ganges, which is rather odd.
L334. “In these plants at high zinc, cell death may increase the release of both vacuolar zinc and
glucosinolate breakdown products, explaining the poor growth of all Psm strains”. As I wrote
above, the bacteria growth is nearly 5 times higher in Ganges than in Wilwerwitz (Figure 4). The
number of bacterial cells in Ganges is roughly two times higher than in Prayon and 6 times
higher than in Viviez. So, 1) I would not put Ganges in the same group than Wilwerwitz from
this point of view and 2) Instead of speaking of all Psm strains, I would speak only of SnC and
SnB.
L345-347. “In the Ganges and Wilwerwiltz populations, therefore, the conclusion of Noret et al.
(2007), that glucosinolates are more important for defence in N. caerulescens than zinc, may be
confounded by the interrelation of these defensive factors.” Noret et al studied the defence
against gastropods (slugs and snails). How can the authors contradict Noret’s conclusions with
results concerning a bacteria? How can the authors combine such different pest types when on
the other side, they make so much distinctions between the populations of one plant species (N.
caerulescens)?
L347-348. “At low zinc, however, the Ganges and Wilwerwiltz plants are, like the Prayon plants,
susceptible to Psm.” This is not what I see in Figure 2: at 0.04 µM, psm causes less cell death in
Ganges than in all the other populations.
L349-351. “Notably, Psm is much more successful in Ganges and Wilwerwiltz plants grown at
0.04 µM zinc than in Prayon plants grown at this zinc concentration.” This is not what I see in
Figure 5: Ganges is around 5.2, Wilwerwitz is around 0.9, and Prayon around 5 bacterial cells cm-
2. So Ganges and Prayon are similar and very different from Wilwerwitz.
General remark on the discussion: Based on an incomplete and partial analysis of doubtful
results, it gives three theories to explain the defence mechanisms of four populations of one plant
species. Is this really science?

label_comment_3
This manuscripts describes the potential protective effects that high zinc accumulation has
against Pseudomonas and tests the hypothesis that Zn-hyperaccumulation is part of the plants
defense strategy against pathogens. This is a well written manuscript and the experimental work
has been carried out appropriately. I do have a comment regarding glucosinolate work.
The glucosinolate assay does not seem very selective. Did the authors do some form of validation
to determine the accuracy of this method? Can the authors say what type of glucosinolates are
produced? Also, the variability in the glucosinolate results and the subsequent study with the
sinigrin do not provide convincing evidence for a role of the unknown glucosinolates that are
produced, the concentrations required to elicit inhibition of Psm also seem very large. It isn’t
know if they are the same compounds detected in the different ecotypes. Saying this the data is
still worth reporting however I believe the shortfalls should be acknowledged. If possible
targeted glucosinolate analysis would improve this part of the work. I also note that possible i.d.s
are mentioned in the discussion.

L266. “The Ganges (Figure 4b) and Wilwerwiltz (Figure 4d) populations gave similar results to
each other.” I disagree with this statement. The maximum response in Wilwerwitz is around 1.6,
while it is around 12 in Ganges. There is roughly 5 times more bacterial cells in leaves of Ganges
than in those of Wilwerwitz.
L285-290. “Both of these possibilities are exemplified by the Prayon population, in which metal
hyperaccumulation has led to a constitutive loss of ROS-based defences (Fones et al., 2013), and
where high metal availability lessens the inducible glucosinolate and cell death responses. It may
not be coincidental that these trade-offs are most evident in the Prayon population, which
accumulates significantly higher concentrations of foliar zinc than the other populations in this
work.”
This argument is not convincing, as the difference in Zn accumulation between Prayon and the
other populations is not so pronounced: there is no significant difference at 0.04 µM and 10 µM
exposures; at 10 µM, Prayon is around 3000 mg kg-1 when the other populations are 2000 mg kg-
1; at 300 µM, Prayon is 7000 mg kg-1 when the other populations are 6000 mg kg-1. I am not
convinced that this difference in Zn accumulation would justify a trade-off to exist in Prayon and
not in the other populations. My doubt is reinforced by the fact that in soil cultivation, Prayon is
not the population which the more accumulates Zn.
L313-315. “The Viviez population, like Prayon, shows an apparent defensive trade-off between
zinc and pathogen-induced cell death (Figure 2). However, in this population, zinc and
glucosinolate concentrations are positively correlated (Figure 3).” It is not true, when looking at
Figure 3 (and at Figure 1), that Zn and glucosinolate concentrations are positively correlated in
the Viviez population, as there is no difference in glucosinolate content for 0.04, 10 and 300 µM
Zn exposures.
L331-332. “Both [Ganges and Wilwerwitz] populations show high glucosinolate concentrations,
particularly at high zinc, and a cell-death response that is positively correlated with zinc
accumulation.” From Figure 3, I cannot see more glucosinolate in Ganges and Wilwerwitz than in
Viviez. Taking each treatment separately, I do not see any positive correlation of cell death level
with Zn concentration, except may-be for mock treatment in Ganges, which is rather odd.
L334. “In these plants at high zinc, cell death may increase the release of both vacuolar zinc and
glucosinolate breakdown products, explaining the poor growth of all Psm strains”. As I wrote
above, the bacteria growth is nearly 5 times higher in Ganges than in Wilwerwitz (Figure 4). The
number of bacterial cells in Ganges is roughly two times higher than in Prayon and 6 times
higher than in Viviez. So, 1) I would not put Ganges in the same group than Wilwerwitz from
this point of view and 2) Instead of speaking of all Psm strains, I would speak only of SnC and
SnB.
L345-347. “In the Ganges and Wilwerwiltz populations, therefore, the conclusion of Noret et al.
(2007), that glucosinolates are more important for defence in N. caerulescens than zinc, may be
confounded by the interrelation of these defensive factors.” Noret et al studied the defence
against gastropods (slugs and snails). How can the authors contradict Noret’s conclusions with
results concerning a bacteria? How can the authors combine such different pest types when on
the other side, they make so much distinctions between the populations of one plant species (N.
caerulescens)?
12
L347-348. “At low zinc, however, the Ganges and Wilwerwiltz plants are, like the Prayon plants,
susceptible to Psm.” This is not what I see in Figure 2: at 0.04 µM, psm causes less cell death in
Ganges than in all the other populations.
L349-351. “Notably, Psm is much more successful in Ganges and Wilwerwiltz plants grown at
0.04 µM zinc than in Prayon plants grown at this zinc concentration.” This is not what I see in
Figure 5: Ganges is around 5.2, Wilwerwitz is around 0.9, and Prayon around 5 bacterial cells cm-
2. So Ganges and Prayon are similar and very different from Wilwerwitz.
General remark on the discussion: Based on an incomplete and partial analysis of doubtful
results, it gives three theories to explain the defence mechanisms of four populations of one plant
species. Is this really science?

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscripts describes the potential protective effects that high zinc accumulation has
against Pseudomonas and tests the hypothesis that Zn-hyperaccumulation is part of the plants
defense strategy against pathogens. This is a well written manuscript and the experimental work
has been carried out appropriately. I do have a comment regarding glucosinolate work.
The glucosinolate assay does not seem very selective. Did the authors do some form of validation
to determine the accuracy of this method? Can the authors say what type of glucosinolates are
produced? Also, the variability in the glucosinolate results and the subsequent study with the
sinigrin do not provide convincing evidence for a role of the unknown glucosinolates that are
produced, the concentrations required to elicit inhibition of Psm also seem very large. It isn’t
know if they are the same compounds detected in the different ecotypes. Saying this the data is
still worth reporting however I believe the shortfalls should be acknowledged. If possible
targeted glucosinolate analysis would improve this part of the work. I also note that possible i.d.s
are mentioned in the discussion.

This manuscript addresses the relationships among heavy metal tolerance, cell death responses,
and bacterial growth in four populations of a wild mustard. The Prayon population is shown
here to have significantly higher leaf concentrations of Zinc following zinc application and
significantly lower leaves of cell death than are present in the other populations. Glucosinolate
levels in the Prayon population are higher than the other populations at low levels of zinc
application, but lower than the other populations at higher levels of zinc application. Bacterial
titers are shown in Fig. 4 with different units on different graphs in a way that defies explanation.
I have rarely in my 20+ years in the field looked at a figure this many times and had so little that I
could offer in summary. Given that the emphasis in the paper is on population comparisons,
rather than the strain comparisons, it is necessary to use the same Y axis units in all of four of
these subplots (Fig. 4a - d). I don't think it is fair to your readers to put them through such an

The authors analysed four populations of the Zn hyperaccumulator N. caerulescens which are
known to accumulate different levels of Zn in their tissues. They grow these at different Zn
concentrations and measure a number of parameters connected to bacterial disease resistance.
They include some bacterial mutant disease strains so they can evaluate the importance of Zn
sensitivity to the ability of bacteria to attack these plants. The research is interesting and the
manuscript is well written. I also read the reply to the answers of the three previous referees and
I agree with referee 3 about the fact that It could be important to understand which type of
glucosinolates are produced. In a previous work de Graaf et al 2014 Phytochemistry 110 (2015)
166–171 different Noccaea caeurulescens populations accumulating and non accumulating also
different metals (Zn, Cd, Ni) were analysed by NMR and MS as far as the concentration of
different glucosinolates are concerned. Among those there are also the populations used in this
study. The authors concluded that there was no apparent relation between the level of soil
pollution at the location of origin, and the presence of glucomoringin. So this work needs at least
to be commented in light also of your findings in the discussion section. Minor points: line 56

Dear Editors,
The authors of the manuscript detailed above would like to thank the three
reviewers for their comments. We are very pleased that Reviewers 1 and 3 took
such a favourable view of the work that we presented. We will address their few
comments first in this response, and then turn to the more detailed critique
provided by Reviewer 2, for whose thorough approach we are also grateful. We will
address the Reviewers’ comments point by point, beginning with a quotation from
their comments (in italics), and, where necessary, quoting portions of our
manuscript (indented) with alterations made shown in red. We give line numbers
for these quotations, which refer to line numbers in the revised manuscript, while
line numbers quoted from Reviewers will, of course, refer to the original
submission.
We believe that we have addressed all points raised appropriately and hope that
our changes and arguments will prove persuasive to you as Editors. We look
forward to hearing from you in due course.
Yours Faithfully,
Dr Helen Fones, Prof Andrew Smith, and Prof Gail Preston.
Reviewer: 1
• The authors use four populations of the variable Zn hyperaccumulator N.
caerulescens. They grow these at different Zn concentrations and measure a number
of parameters connected to bacterial disease resistance. They include some mutant
disease strains so they can evaluate the importance of Zn sensitivity to the ability of
bacteria to attack these plants. The authors find a fairly complex story, in which the
plants vary in several traits that relate to disease resistance.
I think the research is well done and the manuscript is well written. The authors do a
good job with experimental design and execution, and provide reasonable
explanations for their results. I particularly like their flow-chart model of the factors
involved (Fig. 5) and think it helps to provide a big picture summary of their findings.
<U+F0E8> We thank the reviewer for this incisive summary of the work presented and for
these positive remarks.
• I found only a few minor items that might be modified in revision:
1) Lines 59-60: El Mehdawi et al. 2014 is cited in a sentence about the variability of
N. caerulescens from Europe. I don’t understand why, because the El Mehdawi paper
deals with Se hyperaccumulators from the western United States. Thus citing it
seems out of place.
<U+F0E8> We agree that this citation is not helpful here, and have removed it.
• 2) Lines 273-275: This single sentence paragraph reports a lack of correlation
between glucosinolates and bacterial inhibition. The reader is wondering what data
are leading the authors to that conclusion, as they do not refer us to any reported
results. Was a correlation analysis done?
<U+F0E8> We thank the Reviewer for noting this omission and have included a
description of the statistical analysis upon which this statement is based.
The relevant passage now reads:
“No correlation was detected between the level of glucosinolates in plants and
inhibition of bacterial growth, even when the presence or absence of cell death,
as detected using trypan blue staining, was taken into account (multiple
regression analyses, within populations: Prayon - P = 0.05, R2 = 0.20; Ganges - P
= 0.07, R2 = 0.16; Viviez - 0.23, R2 = 0.08; Wilwerwiltz – P= 0.09, R2 = 0.15; across
populations, all: P = 0.24, R2 = 0.25; across populations, including only
treatments with trypan blue staining % responses greater than those seen in
Arabidopsis controls (mock inoculation, 10% or Psm, 20%): P = 0.15, R2 = 0.58).”
(Lines 284-288).
•3) Line 574: Delete “at.”
<U+F0E8> Done; thanks.
•4) Line 643: Replace “replica” with “replicate.”
<U+F0E8> Done; thanks.
Reviewer: 3
•This manuscripts describes the potential protective effects that high zinc
accumulation has against Pseudomonas and tests the hypothesis that Zn-
hyperaccumulation is part of the plants’ defense strategy against pathogens. This is
a well written manuscript and the experimental work has been carried out
appropriately.
<U+F0E8> We thank the reviewer for these positive remarks.
•I do have a comment regarding glucosinolate work. The glucosinolate assay does
not seem very selective.
<U+F0E8> We acknowledge this caveat, and have added a few words to the discussion to
emphasise this limitation, which must be taken into account in interpretation of
our results:
“Although it must be remembered that the assay used in this work does not
distinguish between different types of glucosinolate, we demonstrate that Psm
is sensitive to inhibition by allyl isothiocyanate, the product of sinigrin
hydrolysis…” (Lines 347-348)
•Did the authors do some form of validation to determine the accuracy of this
method?
<U+F0E8> The method was validated by spiking samples with sinigrin at known
concentrations and making sure that at least this concentration of glucosinolate
was recovered by the extraction and estimated by the methods used. On
reviewing the manuscript we find that these details are omitted, and have
therefore added the following to the methods:
“To validate the method, small quantities (0.25 or 0.5 mg in aqueous solution)
of the commercially available glucosinolate, sinigrin, were added to 3 samples
each of ground leaves (0.005 g, Prayon, 10 <U+F06D>M Zn) prior to extraction. These
spiked samples were then treated the same as the experimental samples, and
concentration estimates of > 50 or 100 g of sinigrin per g dried leaf were
confirmed, respectively.” (Lines 176-177).
•Can the authors say what type of glucosinolates are produced? Also, the variability
in the glucosinolate results and the subsequent study with the sinigrin do not provide
convincing evidence for a role of the unknown glucosinolates that are produced, the
concentrations required to elicit inhibition of Psm also seem very large. It isn’t know
if they are the same compounds detected in the different ecotypes. Saying this the
data is still worth reporting however I believe the shortfalls should be acknowledged.
If possible targeted glucosinolate analysis would improve this part of the work. I also
note that possible i.d.s are mentioned in the discussion.
<U+F0E8> As noted above, our assay did not allow the different types of glucosinolate to
be differentiated, and our results reflect only the total glucosinolate
concentrations. We discuss the possible differences in glucosinolate profiles of
different ecotypes and their different toxicities to bacteria (Discussion, Lines
347-355) and acknowledge that further work to investigate this would be of
value in the future, although we believe this to be beyond the scope of the
current work. We are glad that the Reviewer considers the data to be worth
reporting as they stand, and hope that the additions to that we have made to
the discussion are sufficient acknowledgement of their limitations.
Reviewer: 2
•SUMMARY
The results are doubtful; their interpretation is incomplete, questionable and partial.
<U+F0E8> We regret that the Reviewer holds this view and that this critical summary is not
susceptible of a response; we hope that our responses to specific points (please
see below) may be sufficient to demonstrate the appropriateness of our
conviction that this critique is excessive. In support of this as a general point of
view, we of course refer the Editors to the opposed remarks of Reviewer 1:“I
think the research is well done and the manuscript is well written. The authors
do a good job with experimental design and execution, and provide reasonable
explanations for their results.” and Reviewer 3: “This is a well written manuscript
and the experimental work has been carried out appropriately.”
SPECIFIC COMMENTS
•L10-11. “The metal hyperaccumulator plant Noccaea caerulescens uses metals as a
defence against pathogens”. This is not well established, in general, and in particular
in this manuscript. This is a hypothesis and should be presented as so.
<U+F0E8> We have previously published strong evidence that the growth of the bacterial
pathogen, Psm, is restricted in N. caerulescens through direct zinc toxicity
(Fones et al., PLoS Pathogens, 2010). Although the Reviewer is here critiquing
the abstract, in which of necessity details are brief, we discuss these findings in
more detail in the introduction (Lines 42-45). We believe that the ability of
hyperaccumulated zinc to restrict pathogen growth is well established, both in
our work and elsewhere. We refer the Reviewer to the systematic review by
Boyd, 2007, which includes several studies involving pathogens, and to the work
of Hörger et al. (2013). Front Plant Sci 4: 395, which discusses these ideas in
detail (both cited in the part of the Introduction mentioned). We accept that
the idea that metal hyperaccumulation evolved through selection for defence
against pathogens remains an unproven hypothesis, but this is not the claim
that we are making: only that defence against pathogens is a result of metal
hyperaccumulation today. In order to clarify this, we have reworded the
opening sentences of the abstract, as we feel that perhaps our original wording
was inappropriate and potentially misleading, and thus we have inadvertently
misled the Reviewer. The opening sentences now read:
<U+F0E8> “In the metal hyperaccumulator plant Noccaea caerulescens, zinc may provide a
defence against pathogens. However, zinc accumulation is a variable trait in this
species. We hypothesise that this variability affects the outcome of interactions
between metals, and the various constitutive and inducible defences that N.
caerulescens shares with non-accumulator plants.” (Lines 10-13)
<U+F0E8> We have also made the following change to the abstract, to further clarify the
distinction between speculation concerning ‘plausible’ hypotheses for the
evolution of metal hyperaccumulation, and the interpretation of our data
regarding how the plants respond to pathogen challenge in the present day.
The passage:
“These data indicate that defensive enhancement, joint effects and trade-offs
between different forms of defence are all plausible explanations for the
evolution of metal-based defences, with factors including metal availability and
pressures from metal-tolerant pathogens likely shaping the current strategy of
each population.”
Now reads:
“These data indicate that defensive enhancement, joint effects and trade-offs
between different forms of defence are all plausible explanations for the
variation we observe between populations, with factors including metal
availability and metal-tolerant pathogen load, likely shaping the response of
each population to infection.” (lines 21-25)
<U+F0E8> From the general tenor of the Reviewer’s remarks, including this one, we took
the idea that we have, in places, perhaps appeared to draw conclusions about
evolution not necessarily supported by our data. We would not wish to over-
interpret our work nor to mislead the reader, and, with that in mind, we have
made the following additional alterations to the text:
1. ...the hypothesis that metal hyperaccumulation evolved because the metals
provided an effective defence against herbivores or pathogens (lines 40-41)
2. It is possible that metal accumulation evolved as a result of compensates for
deficiencies in other defences (lines 306-307)
3. However, both the retention of cell death response and glucosinolate production
remain possible in Prayon plants, and their deployment are deployed when zinc is
not available suggests that this was not the evolutionary pathway followed in this
case. (lines 311-312).
4. Both of these possibilities are exemplified by the Prayon population, in which
metal hyperaccumulation has led to occurs in conjunction with the constitutive loss
of ROS-based defences. (lines 298-300)
5. The precise strategy used appears to depend both on evolutionary factors which
vary between populations and ecotypes of N. caerulescens… (lines 400-402).
6. Such pathogens might be expected to arise if coevolution with metal
hyperaccumulators local adaptation to a high-metal environment is permitted by
the existence of long-standing populations of these plants metal hyperaccumulator
hosts in metal-rich environments. (lines 392-393).
•L36. Ma et al, 2011 is not in the reference list.
<U+F0E8> We apologise for this omission, which we have now remedied.
•L43-45. “Previously, we have shown that zinc hyperaccumulation by N.
caerulescens is able to restrict the growth of the common bacterial pathogen
Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola (Psm) through direct toxicity of the metal ion
itself (Fones et al., 2010). We confirmed this by using mutants of Psm with altered
zinc tolerance, which showed corresponding changes in their ability to grow in high-
zinc plants.”
It is not because Zn in plant is toxic to a bacteria (and in particular to a Zn sensitive
bacteria) put on the plant that the plant uses the metal for defence, i.e. that Zn
hyperaccumulation is an adaptive trait, with a defence role against bacteria, that is
maintained and has been evolved by natural selection.
<U+F0E8> Unfortunately, we do not find this comment easy to interpret. The findings
under discussion in this part of the Introduction are published in peer-reviewed
journals and have not been refuted by subsequent publications. The gist of the
Reviewer’s comment seems to be an objection to a presumed statement on our
part that Zn hyperaccumulation is an adaptive trait, which has evolved for
defence against pathogens. However, in this passage, we make no claim about
whether zinc hyperaccumulation is, or is not, an adaptive trait, nor about
whether it is currently maintained or has previously arisen through selection for
defence against pathogens – for information on this point we again refer the
Reviewer to the cited reviews of this topic. We merely introduce the fact that,
when zinc hyperaccumulation occurs, it creates an environment within plant
tissues that imposes a requirement for endophyte microorganisms to be zinc
tolerant in order to thrive, and therefore does provide a defence against zinc
sensitive bacterial pathogens, as demonstrated in the work cited.
•L57-60. “N. caerulescens is a variable species (Escarré et al., 2000; Reeves et al.,
2001) whose European populations differ both in morphological and physiological
features, including metal hyperaccumulation (Lombi et al., 2000; Meerts et al., 2003;
Dechamps et al., 2005, 2007, 2011; El Mehdawi et al. 2014).” I am not sure that the
reference to El Mehdawi, dealing with “Symphyotrichum ericoides populations from
seleniferous and nonseleniferous soil display striking variation in selenium
accumulation.” is relevant to a statement about N. caerulescens phenotypical
variability.
<U+F0E8> We agree, and have removed this reference in response to Reviewer 1.
•L61. Macnair et al. 1999 is not in the reference list.
<U+F0E8> We apologise for this omission, which we have now remedied.
•L100-110. The aim of the article is not clear. Some phenomenon and variables are
announced to be investigated or studied, but the tested hypotheses are not clearly
presented.
<U+F0E8> In response to this comment, we have altered the wording of the introduction.
It now reads:
“We test the hypotheses that i) inter-population differences in zinc accumulation
are reflected in differences in vulnerability to pathogens, or in ii) differences in non-
metal based, inducible and non-inducible defences (16). To address the first of
these hypotheses, we study the growth of Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola M4
(Psm)... To address the second hypothesis, we investigate glucosinolate
concentrations, and two inducible stress responses previously found to be altered in
N. caerulescens, when compared to non-hyperaccumulating species – ROS
production and cell death (16).” (Lines 94-102).
•L114.121. Plants. The populations tested were not representative of the existing so-
called ecotypes and populations. The vast majority of N. caerulescens populations
are non metallicolous (Besnard et al. 2009; Gonneau et al. 2017). In this work, three
metallicolous, i.e. calamine populations were tested among four, that is only one
non-metallicolous population was used.
<U+F0E8> We do not argue that the choice of populations represents the species as a
whole, but rather the range of phenotypes that exist within it. We chose Prayon
in previous work as it is a widely studied, well characterized population, showing
typical hyperaccumulation behaviour; obviously this population remains of
interest, at the very least as a benchmark, as we extend our previous work into
more populations. The two populations from the South of France are indeed
calamine populations, which represent the extreme of metal tolerance found in
this species. Of these, Ganges originates from a site with soil rich in zinc and
cadmium, while Prayon and Viviez are from sites where the soil also contains
elevated lead. The Ganges plants, from Zn/Cd soil, are remarkable for their
tolerance and accumulation of cadmium, and as such could be hypothesised to
have different responses to zinc, which may not be their ‘preferred’ metal to
accumulate (zinc inhibits Cd uptake in Prayon, but not in Ganges; Lombi et al.,
2002¸Plant Phys.). Wilwerwiltz was included as an example of a non-
metalliferous ecotype, again likely to display a different relationship with zinc.
Therefore, our choice of ecotypes does not conform to that which would be
expected from a ‘proportional representation’ approach, as the Reviewer seems
to expect, but rather is a selection designed to be scientifically interesting in
testing our hypotheses. To prevent other readers suffering the same
misconception as this Reviewer, we have added the following to the Methods
section, to clarify the reasons for our choice of populations:
“The four populations of N. caerulescens were chosen to represent the
range of metal hyperaccumulation phenotypes seen in this species. Prayon
is a well-characterised accession, with a hyperaccumulation phenotype that
might be considered typical for metalliferous N. caerulescens, and has been
used by us in previous studies (Fones et al., 2010; 2013; 2016). Viviez and
Ganges are both metalliferous accessions with high tolerance to zinc, but
Ganges is also remarkable in its tolerance and accumulation of Cadmium
(Reeves et al., 2001; Lombi et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2002). Wilwerwiltz,
meanwhile, represents a non-metalliferous ecotype of N. caerulescens
(Reeves et al., 2001).” (Lines 111-117).
•L131. What is a technical replicate? Why measuring 6 of those for each sample?
Have the authors used certified reference materials?
<U+F0E8> A technical replicate is a repeated measurement of the same sample, as
opposed to a biological replicate which represents a sample from, in the case
discussed here, a different pool of plant material (from an independent set of
plants). Technical replicates are carried out to allow the researcher to account
for error in the data at the technical level – variation between measurements of
the same sample represents machine or operator error. In the case of Atomic
Absorption Spectrophotometry, the instrument is a delicate and sensitive one.
Several technical replicates are taken to ensure that there is – as should be the
case – almost no noise in the readings. We carried out six technical replicates as
this was the most reasonable balance between the ideal (measure the entire
sample, maximum technical replication) and the practical (limitations of time,
cost, and so on). To ensure that these details are clear in the manuscript, we
have altered the wording of this section slightly. It now reads:
“For each treatment / population combination, three biological replicates, each
consisting of pooled leaf tissue from 5–10 plants, were used; for each of these
biological replicates, six technical replicates were measured.” (lines 127-129).
<U+F0E8> Certified reference material was used, of course; this is described in the work to
which the reader is referred for more details (Fones et al., 2010) - Certified
Reference Material LGC7162 (strawberry leaves; LGC Standards, Teddington,
UK).
•Bacteria. What is the number of replicates?
<U+F0E8> This question apparently pertains to the section of the Materials and Methods
in which the bacterial strains used in the work are described. This does not
describe an experiment per se and thus replication is not a relevant detail at this
point – we are therefore puzzled as to what the Reviewer is really asking here.
For the experiments using bacteria, the replication levels are described in the
relevant Materials and Methods sections, as well as in the figure legends.
•L176-177. “Hartley, 1950; David, 1952” are not in the reference list.
<U+F0E8> We thank the Reviewer for their diligence and have corrected this omission.
•L189-192. “At 30 and 300 µM zinc, Prayon plants accumulated the highest foliar
concentrations of zinc, whereas plants from Ganges (one of the most metal-tolerant
populations of this species) accumulated significantly less zinc than Prayon at these
two treatment concentrations.” This presentation of the results in Figure 1 is
incomplete. It should also be said that at 30 and 300 µM zinc, there is no difference
between Ganges, Viviez and Wilwerwitz. It should also be said that at 10 µM there is
no difference between the populations and that at 0.04 µM Prayon is similar to
Viviez and Ganges to Wilwerwitz.
<U+F0E8> It would not be correct to say that there are no differences at 10 µM; this is
shown in the letters above the bars, which indicate which populations showed
statistically significant differences in zinc concentrations. The information that
the Reviewer wishes to see in the text regarding the zinc concentrations at 0.04
µM is also conveyed clearly in the figure. Since we would not wish to mislead,
we have expanded our description of the data for 30 and 300 µM by adding the
following:
“…whereas plants from Ganges (one of the most metal-tolerant populations
of this species) accumulated significantly less zinc than Prayon at these two
treatment concentrations, showing no significant difference in zinc
concentration from the Viviez and Wilwerwiltz plants.” (Lines 200-202).
•Moreover, the ranking of the populations according to Zn accumulation was
completely different to that found by Sterckeman et al. (2017) who grew 60
populations in a soil containing nearly 1000 mg Zn kg-1. In their case, non-
metallicolous populations generally concentrated much more Zn than the calamine
ones. In particular, they found 12908 mg Zn kg-1 in Wilwerwitz, 2871 mg Zn kg-1 in
Ganges, 2865 mg Zn kg-1 in Prayon and 2380 mg Zn kg-1 in Viviez (see their
supplementary material, Table S6). I wonder which of the rankings is the more
representative of the plants in the field. I would suggest that soil cultivation is closer
to in situ conditions than hydroponics carried out in this work.
<U+F0E8> This difference is indeed very interesting and it is possible that the Reviewer’s
suggestion is correct. Nevertheless, we do not consider this a cause for concern
in assessing the value of the work we present here, for these reasons:
o Firstly, the data we present here concern the zinc accumulated by
the plants in our experiments. Although plants may accumulate zinc
to differing extents under differing conditions, the zinc
concentrations we report are those that apply to the plants in our
experiments. Thus, when we conclude, for example, that there is a
particular correlation between zinc concentrations and
glucosinolate concentrations, this is true for the plants with which
we worked under the range of zinc treatments to which they were
exposed. Thus, in attributing a lack of bacterial growth to zinc,
glucosinolates or their combinatory effect (again for example), we
base our conclusions on the conditions that we know the bacteria to
have experienced in these experiments.
o Secondly, the Reviewer is here comparing our results to those
obtained with more zinc than in our highest zinc treatment. We
would not wish to extrapolate beyond our treatments, and make no
claim within the manuscript that the zinc accumulation rankings we
report would be unchanged under this regime.
o Thirdly, while we indeed acknowledge that the Reviewer may be
correct in attributing the difference between our results and the
findings of Sterckeman et al. (2017) to the matter of soil vs.
hydroponic growth, these differences are susceptible of other
interpretations. It is known, for example, that zinc uptake can be
affected by bioavailable iron, soil microbes, and other factors. Just
as the uptake of cadmium by N. caerulescens is inhibited by zinc in
many populations, but not in Ganges plants, so may these factors
differentially affect the various populations in these studies.
Therefore, the differences in population zinc accumulation
‘rankings’ may be due to one or more variables outside the scope of
both studies, which, while constant in each study, may differ
between them.
o Fourthly, it has been reported (see for e.g. Escarré et al., 2013) that
there is significant intrapopulation variability in zinc
hyperaccumulation. While we believe our results to be
representative, it is possible that one or both studies does not
reflect the ‘average’ of the population. If it were to be shown that
this was in fact the case for our plants, we would, of course, refer
the Reviewer to the first point in this list: the data represent the
plants that we worked with and to which our other results relate.
•L192-193. “In all four populations, treatment with up to 300 µM zinc caused no
visible stress or stunting, with plants showing neither visible chlorosis nor
anthocyanin production”. Apparent aspect is not sufficient to evaluate stress. At
least root and shoot biomass, as well as root length should have been measured.
<U+F0E8> We agree with this point, but, in the current work, we did not consider it to be
essential for our conclusions that no plants were stressed, and have thus not
conducted these measurements. We merely mention the observation that
there were no visible signs of stress.
•L195-208. As far as I understand, the methods for the measurement of ROS, H2O2,
superoxyde were not presented in the Materials and Methods section. Why? I think
they should be, even if the figures are presented in supplementary materials.
<U+F0E8> We have added the following to the methods section:
“Staining for hydrogen peroxide and superoxide: N. caerulescens plants
were treated with 0.04, 10, 30, or 300 <U+F06D>M zinc. Three leaves of each of six
plants were infiltrated with P. syringae pv. maculicola M4 at 107 cfu/ml in 10
mM MgCl2, with 10 mM MgCl2, or left untreated. Arabidopsis thaliana
plants were inoculated with Psm at 105 cfu/ml. After 1, 2, or 6 h, leaves
were excised and stained overnight in 0.01% (w/v) DAB (3,3-
diaminobenzidine, for H2O2) or NBT (Nitrobluetetrazolium, for O2<U+25AA>–) solution
before decolouring in 100% methanol. Decoloured leaves were
photographed and images were analysed for percentage area coloured
brown (DAB) or blue (NBT) using specifically written software as described
in Fones et al. (2013).” (Lines 156-163)
•L212. “Plants of the Prayon population showed little or no trypan blue staining if
uninoculated, and no significant response to mock inoculation, with small but
significant levels of cell death in response to Psm, particularly at low zinc
concentrations.” It should be pointed out that there was no significant response to
Psm at 300 µM.
<U+F0E8> We have made the following addition:
“…with small but significant levels of cell death in response to Psm at low
zinc concentrations, and no cell death in response to Psm at 300 µM zinc.”
(Line 221-223).
•L216-220. “By contrast, both Ganges and Wilwerwiltz plants showed high levels of
cell death, even in the absence of inoculation, if grown on low zinc. This is suggestive
of a highly sensitive or spontaneous cell-death response, which is suppressed when
the plants are grown on high zinc. In response to both mock and Psm inoculation,
these plants showed extensive cell death, leading to 45- 50% of the leaf area being
stained by trypan blue. Unlike the cell death response in Prayon and Viviez plants,
this response was not suppressed by zinc.”
•Looking quickly at Figure 2, I could differentiate Ganges from Wilwerwitz as the
latter shows a higher response to Psm.
<U+F0E8> This is true, but does not invalidate the points raised in the quoted section. The
statistical significance of this difference was not tested and so the difference
was not explicitly pointed out. We have, in this work, confined our statistical
comparisons to within-population responses, where the only variable is the
treatment(s) under consideration. We then compare more broadly the patterns
of response (e.g. a positive correlation between zinc and cell death vs no
correlation) between the populations. We stand by this approach, and hope
that the Reviewer can see that it is not inappropriate.
•However, I have several concerns about these results. Concerning Ganges: Why is
the response to the mock treatment similar or much higher to that of Psm at 0.04,
10, 30 and 300 µM?
<U+F0E8> There may be a number of reasons for these results, and to discuss them in a
manuscript in which they have not been investigated would be merely to
speculate. However, in our opinion, one plausible reason is that, while Ganges
has a very sensitive cell death response, triggered by even the minor stress of
mock inoculation, this population is susceptible to effectors in Psm which
suppress the cell death response. This is a common strategy for biotrophic and
hemibiotrophic plant pathogens and is certainly within the repertoire of Psm.
This hypothesis is consistent with our results, despite the poor growth of Psm in
high zinc Ganges plants, as effectors can affect the plant very rapidly (within
minutes in some cases) and thus cell death suppression would not be
dependent on bacterial population growth. To test this hypothesis, one would
need to study mutants of Psm deficient in effector delivery (e.g. mutants lacking
a functional type three secretion system) in Ganges, which is beyond the scope
of the current work, although certainly of interest in the future.
•Why is the response to Psm so low to 30 µM while it is so higher at 10 µM and at
300 µM?
•Concerning Wilwerwitz: Why is there a response to mock treatment at 0.04 µM
significantly higher than those of untreated and Psm?
•The standard errors in Figure 2 are often very high. These remarks make me
consider that the results in Figure 2 are not reliable enough.
<U+F0E8> Again, these specific questions can only be answered through speculation.
Concerning the more general criticism here: we are happy to acknowledge that
this is a variable system with a good deal of noise in the data. This, however, is
expected of a system composed of two inherently variable biological organisms
interacting, and where the interaction itself may have some variability
associated with it. For instance, it is known that there is intrapopulation
variability in the responses of some populations of N. caerulescens to metals.
We accept that some apparently significant results may therefore reflect Type II
error – specifically, of course, those examples that the Reviewer has highlighted
as surprising. If the experiment were replicated sufficient times, perhaps these
possible errors would disappear. If they did not, they would merit further
investigation, but our acceptance of the truth of this variability is precisely why
we have not dwelt in detail on each individual bar in this figure. What is
important, we believe, is that these data are the unadulterated results of a
replicated experiment. The data are clearly robust enough to demonstrate
patterns in each population – there can be little doubt, for instance, that
Wilwerwiltz plants display an exaggerated cell death response to Psm at all zinc
concentrations except 0.04 µM, in striking contrast to Viviez plants, which
display such a response only at the lowest concentration of zinc. We have
particular confidence in these results because they show a large effect, which is
repeated and is significant despite the large standard errors noted by the
reviewer. This is, then, not a chance difference in the relationship between zinc,
Psm and cell death in these two populations. We would like to add that it is
precisely for the reasons raised by the Reviewer that we have confined our
discussion to this broader level of identification of patterns and correlations,
rather than the in-depth dissection of every bar in the figure that this Reviewer
seems to advocate: we feel that the latter would constitute over-analysis of
necessarily limited data. Being thus aware of the limitations in our data, we
nevertheless stand by the conclusions drawn with respect to interpopulation
differences in response patterns.
•L266. “The Ganges (Figure 4b) and Wilwerwiltz (Figure 4d) populations gave similar
results to each other.” I disagree with this statement. The maximum response in
Wilwerwitz is around 1.6, while it is around 12 in Ganges. There is roughly 5 times
more bacterial cells in leaves of Ganges than in those of Wilwerwitz.
<U+F0E8> The Reviewer is correct to note the differences in the axes of the panels of Fig 4.
We make no attempt to hide these differences in overall bacterial growth in the
four populations, and it is addressed in the Discussion (e.g. “Notably, Psm is
much more successful in Ganges and Wilwerwiltz plants grown at 0.04 <U+F06D>M zinc
than in Prayon plants grown at this zinc concentration. This may be in part
because Prayon plants do not rely upon zinc to promote glucosinolate
production.” Lines 366-368).
<U+F0E8> Once again, however, we must protest that in our opinion, in focussing so
heavily on such details, the Reviewer fails to recognise the main conclusion to
be drawn from this figure. A cursory glance at Fig 4 shows the striking similarity
between the patterns of bacterial growth in panels b and d (Ganges and
Wilwerwiltz). We stand by our decision to call the reader’s attention to this
similarity.
•L285-290. “Both of these possibilities are exemplified by the Prayon population, in
which metal hyperaccumulation has led to a constitutive loss of ROS-based defences
(Fones et al., 2013), and where high metal availability lessens the inducible
glucosinolate and cell death responses. It may not be coincidental that these trade-
offs are most evident in the Prayon population, which accumulates significantly
higher concentrations of foliar zinc than the other populations in this work.”
This argument is not convincing, as the difference in Zn accumulation between
Prayon and the other populations is not so pronounced: there is no significant
difference at 0.04 µM and 10 µM exposures; at 10 µM, Prayon is around 3000 mg
kg-1 when the other populations are 2000 mg kg-1; at 300 µM, Prayon is 7000 mg
kg-1 when the other populations are 6000 mg kg-1. I am not convinced that this
difference in Zn accumulation would justify a trade-off to exist in Prayon and not in
the other populations. My doubt is reinforced by the fact that in soil cultivation,
Prayon is not the population which the more accumulates Zn.
<U+F0E8> We agree that this line of argument would require further investigation to be
considered as fact, and we do not attempt to claim it as such. We state only
that it may not be coincidence.
<U+F0E8> However, in support of this idea, we would like to remind the Reviewer that:
o Differences in zinc accumulation are naturally less pronounced at
low zinc concentrations, and that the 0.04 µM treatment used in
this work is the closest to no zinc at all that it is possible to grow
these plants successfully (Fones et al. 2010). Thus the lack of
differences between the populations at 0.04 µM zinc is entirely as
expected. The lack of differences at 10 µM zinc are also
unsurprising, and say little about the capacity of these populations
to accumulate zinc – these low concentrations are, however,
necessary to see the response of the plants to zinc with respect to
glucosinolates, cell death, bacterial growth etc – we could not
attribute an effect to zinc without studying multiple zinc
treatments;
o The trade-off that occurs in the Prayon plants was first established
in another publication (Fones et al., 2013);
o Prayon is known to be among the most zinc tolerant accessions of
N. caerulescens, and to show a foraging response for zinc in root
growth (Assunçaõ et al., 2003), consistent with the concept that it
may be more reliant on zinc, in some way, than other populations;
o We are not suggesting that our data would “justify a trade-off to
exist” – we make no such argument. Merely, we propose that, since
Prayon is known to show a trade-off between metal
hyperaccumulation and defence responses, and is seen here to lack
glucosinolates and Psm-inducible cell death at high zinc, it is
possible this reflects an extension of the same trade-off.
•L313-315. “The Viviez population, like Prayon, shows an apparent defensive trade-
off between zinc and pathogen-induced cell death (Figure 2). However, in this
population, zinc and glucosinolate concentrations are positively correlated (Figure
3).” It is not true, when looking at Figure 3 (and at Figure 1), that Zn and
glucosinolate concentrations are positively correlated in the Viviez population, as
there is no difference in glucosinolate content for 0.04, 10 and 300 µM Zn
exposures.
<U+F0E8> This is incorrect. Figure 3 shows clearly that the Viviez population has very low
glucosinolate at 0.04 <U+F06D>M zinc, and much higher glucosinolate concentrations at
all other zinc concentrations. The positive correlation is admittedly essentially a
step-change at zinc treatments of 10 <U+F06D>M and above, but despite this a quick
correlation analysis of log[zinc] vs [glucosinolate] gives a linear fit with slope 7.3
(positive correlation) and adjusted R2 of 0.79.
•L331-332. “Both [Ganges and Wilwerwitz] populations show high glucosinolate
concentrations, particularly at high zinc, and a cell-death response that is positively
correlated with zinc accumulation.” From Figure 3, I cannot see more glucosinolate
in Ganges and Wilwerwitz than in Viviez. Taking each treatment separately, I do not
see any positive correlation of cell death level with Zn concentration, except may-be
for mock treatment in Ganges, which is rather odd.
<U+F0E8> We agree; we are not claiming that these populations have more glucosinolate
than Viviez. No comparison between these populations and Viviez is drawn
here; Viviez is discussed elsewhere. Neither is any correlation between
glucosinolate levels and cell death claimed. We only state, as quoted, that both
these populations have high glucosinolate at high zinc, and, separately, that
both have a positive correlation between cell death and zinc accumulation.
Both of these claims are true – see Fig 2 and Fig 3. If we were to seek such a
(direct) correlation, then, comparing Figs 2 and 3, it is not the mock treatment
response of Ganges that should be singled out as exemplifying this (it is indeed
high at 300 <U+F06D>M Zn, when glucosinolates are high, but is considerably lower at 30
<U+F06D>M Zn, while glucosinolates remain high), but rather the Psm response of
Wilwerwiltz, for which cell death levels, seem to follow glucosinolate
concentrations very neatly. However, we stress that we have not made such a
comparison formally, nor would we wish to, as there is at least one obvious
confounding factor in such correlations (zinc).
•L334. “In these plants at high zinc, cell death may increase the release of both
vacuolar zinc and glucosinolate breakdown products, explaining the poor growth of
all Psm strains”. As I wrote above, the bacteria growth is nearly 5 times higher in
Ganges than in Wilwerwitz (Figure 4). The number of bacterial cells in Ganges is
roughly two times higher than in Prayon and 6 times higher than in Viviez. So, 1) I
would not put Ganges in the same group than Wilwerwitz from this point of view
and 2) Instead of speaking of all Psm strains, I would speak only of SnC and SnB.
<U+F0E8> As we have already remarked, inducible cell death responses to pathogen
detected can occur very rapidly and are neither dependent on, nor a measure
of, bacterial population growth. They are instead a response to the detection of
a stressor. Indeed, the fact that such responses can in some cases be induced
by abiotic stresses (e.g. mock inoculation in Ganges plants) exemplifies this.
<U+F0E8> In response to 1), we must reiterate the earlier point that Ganges and
Wilwerwiltz have similar overall patterns of bacterial growth, and this is why
they are frequently discussed together (we also remark on their differences).
<U+F0E8> In response to 2) we are afraid that we do not understand this remark. The Psm
strains are Psm and its mutants 9A6 and 10C1. SnC10 and SnB11 are naturally
occurring endophytic Pseudomonas from N. caerulescens, but they are not Psm
strains. This is explained in Materials and Methods, under bacteria, and for
more details the Reviewer is referred to Fones et al., 2010 and 2013. At any
rate, the point we are making here concerns the poor growth of Psm and its zinc
tolerance mutants – including strain 9A6, which has increased zinc tolerance – in
Ganges and Wilwerwiltz plants at high zinc. We are not, in the sentence quoted,
discussing the endophytic strains SnC10 and SnB11 at all. These strains in
Ganges and Wilwerwiltz are the subject of lines 371-386.
•L345-347. “In the Ganges and Wilwerwiltz populations, therefore, the conclusion of
Noret et al. (2007), that glucosinolates are more important for defence in N.
caerulescens than zinc, may be confounded by the interrelation of these defensive
factors.” Noret et al studied the defence against gastropods (slugs and snails). How
can the authors contradict Noret’s conclusions with results concerning a bacteria?
How can the authors combine such different pest types when on the other side, they
make so much distinctions between the populations of one plant species (N.
caerulescens)?
<U+F0E8> The Reviewer appears to have, unfortunately, misconstrued this sentence. We
do not contradict the work of Noret et al. (2007), who used neither Ganges nor
Wilwerwiltz in their study, as far as are aware. We are suggesting, instead, that
the interrelation of these defensive factors makes the extrapolation of their
work to other populations impossible. We have edited this passage for clarity:
“These findings in the Ganges and Wilwerwiltz populations suggest that extreme
caution is needed when extrapolating information concerning
hyperaccumulator defence to populations beyond those it originates from. For
example, Noret et al. (2007) found that glucosinolates are more important for
defence in N. caerulescens than zinc, but did not use Ganges or Wilwerwiltz in
their work; were their results to be applied to these populations, they may be
confounded by the interrelation of defensive factors that we have uncovered in
those plants.” (Lines 357-362).
•L347-348. “At low zinc, however, the Ganges and Wilwerwiltz plants are, like the
Prayon plants, susceptible to Psm.” This is not what I see in Figure 2: at 0.04 µM,
psm causes less cell death in Ganges than in all the other populations.
<U+F0E8> The quoted statement relates to susceptibility to Psm, that is, to Psm growth in
planta, not to cell death, which is often related to the plant defence response
and is thus not a measure of susceptibility. Thus, we refer the Reviewer to
Figure 4 instead of Figure 2.
•L349-351. “Notably, Psm is much more successful in Ganges and Wilwerwiltz plants
grown at 0.04 µM zinc than in Prayon plants grown at this zinc concentration.” This
is not what I see in Figure 5: Ganges is around 5.2, Wilwerwitz is around 0.9, and
Prayon around 5 bacterial cells cm-2. So Ganges and Prayon are similar and very
different from Wilwerwitz.
<U+F0E8> This is incorrect, and a surprising remark given that the Reviewer previously
noted the different y-axes on the panels of Figure 4 (we assume the Reviewer
means to refer to Figure 4, which shows bacterial growth, and not Figure 5, the
model). The correct numbers of bacteria per cm2 leaf are: Ganges ~5x106 (5
Million), Wilwerwitz ~0.9x106 (approx. 1 Million), and Prayon ~5x105 (half a
Million). Thus the Psm population in Ganges is approximately an order of
magnitude higher than in Prayon, while in Wilwerwiltz it is roughly double that
in Prayon.
•General remark on the discussion: Based on an incomplete and partial analysis of
doubtful results, it gives three theories to explain the defence mechanisms of four
populations of one plant species. Is this really science?
We hope that we have successfully argued against this destructive criticism in our
response to the more useful, specific comments. To respond directly to this remark
is difficult, as it contains no substantive point. However, as to whether our results
are doubtful, our analysis partial, and our conclusion that there are different
defensives strategies at play in different populations of N. caerulescens from
different edaphic environments unscientific, we would like to take this opportunity
to quote from Reviewer 1: “I think the research is well done and the manuscript is
well written. The authors do a good job with experimental design and execution, and
provide reasonable explanations for their results” and Reviewer 3: “This is a well
written manuscript and the experimental work has been carried out appropriately.”
We will let their views speak for us on these points.
•References: Alfano, Asad et al (2015), Hogenhout, Pollard (2000) are not cited in

<U+F0E8> We thank the Reviewer for their diligence in checking. The references Alfano et
al., (2004); Hogenhout et al., (2009) and Pollard (2000) have been added to the

Reviewer for drawing these to our attention (line 54).
•Figure 4: Statistical test letters are missing in Wilwerwitz.
<U+F0E8> This is incorrect. Bonferroni simultaneous comparisons (from which these
letters are generated – see ‘Statistical Analyses’, lines 184-186) are only
appropriate where the underlying ANOVA shows a significant result. The results
for Wilwerwiltz show no such significance, so Bonferroni comparisons cannot be
carried out, and no letters can be applied.
•Figure 5. This model is complicated. It has not been clearly demonstrated by this
work. May be the model could be presented in the introduction, to justify which part
of it is going to be demonstrated.
<U+F0E8> We disagree, as the model is dependent on experimental observations made in
this study, which include observations that could not have been inferred from
prior work, and will refute this comment by quoting from Reviewer 1 again: “I
particularly like their flow-chart model of the factors involved (Fig. 5) and think it
helps to provide a big picture summary of their findings.”

Reviewer: 4
This manuscript addresses the relationships among heavy metal tolerance, cell death
responses, and bacterial growth in four populations of a wild mustard. The Prayon
population is shown here to have significantly higher leaf concentrations of Zinc
following zinc application and significantly lower leaves of cell death than are
present in the other populations. Glucosinolate levels in the Prayon population are
higher than the other populations at low levels of zinc application, but lower than
the other populations at higher levels of zinc application. Bacterial titers are shown
in Fig. 4 with different units on different graphs in a way that defies explanation. I
have rarely in my 20+ years in the field looked at a figure this many times and had so
little that I could offer in summary. Given that the emphasis in the paper is on
population comparisons, rather than the strain comparisons, it is necessary to use
the same Y axis units in all of four of these subplots (Fig. 4a - d). I don't think it is fair
to your readers to put them through such an effort to see your pattern.
<U+F0B7> We apologise for this lack of clarity concerning Figure 4; we accept that it
was necessary to look carefully at the y-axis labels on the submitted version
of the Figure. This figure shows bacterial numbers in N. caerulescens leaves
at 0 and 5 days post inoculation. Panels a-d refer to bacterial numbers in N.
caerulescens plants from Prayon, Ganges, Viviez and Wilwerwiltz,
respectively. Each of these populations of N. caerulescens plants was grown
at 4 zinc concentrations, shown by the colours of the bars. Finally, in each
panel, we see results for each of five different bacterial strains: Psm and two
of its zinc-tolerance mutants, and two field Pseudomonas syringae isolates.
In discussing our results, we compared the performance of the same
bacterial strain in one N. caerulescens population across the four zinc
treatments, allowing us to draw conclusions about the effect of zinc on each
bacterial strain, in each population (Discussion, lines 254-283). We also
compare the growth of the different bacteria within each population –
particularly concerning Psm and the Psm mutants, but also the field isolates.
We are thus able to discuss whether or not differences in zinc tolerance can
explain differences in bacterial performance within each N. caerulescens
population (Discussion, lines 254-283). Thus we cannot entirely agree with
the Reviewer’s dismissal of the importance of strain comparisons in this
work
<U+F0B7> Given the above, and the fact that bacterial population sizes range from
500,000 to 12,000,000 - to present each panel with the same y-axis would
obscure the significant differences observed among some of the smaller
bacterial populations. The similar patterns (with different absolute values)
seen among bacterial populations in Ganges and Wilwerwiltz would also be
obscured, because everything in Wilwerwiltz would simply appear ‘small’.
<U+F0B7> To best retain the legibility of the graphs while improving the immediacy of
the information concerning absolute bacterial numbers and how these
differ between populations of N. caerulescens, we have changed the y-axes
on panels b & d so that the numbers are expressed in cfu/ml x 10^5 in all
panels. This leads to the rather unconventional result that panel b’s y-axis
now reaches 160x10^5. We hope, however, that under the circumstances,
this will be considered acceptable, as it has the effect of making the
differences in absolute bacterial numbers immediately obvious without
obscuring between strain or between-zinc treatment differences in bacterial
growth.
Please make sure that the statistical values are shown for all bars. In my version,
some bars have letters above them and some don't for both Fig. 4 and Fig. 3.
<U+F0B7> Details of the statistical tests undertaken are given in the methods section:
“Statistical Analyses: Datasets were analysed using analysis of
variance (ANOVA) with simultaneous Bonferroni comparisons,
carried out in Minitab (Minitab Inc., Coventry, UK). In figures, the
data points whose means were found to be significantly different in
Bonferroni comparisons are marked with different letters.”
(Methods, Statistical Analyses, lines 184-187)
<U+F0B7> It is not appropriate to carry our Bonferroni simultaneous comparisons –
whose role is to determine which data points lead to significance in an
ANOVA – when the underlying ANOVA is non-significant. Thus, where a
figure displays multiple independent datasets (such as different bacterial
strains), which have been analysed independently, it is possible that some
bars do not, and should not, have letters above them. The precise
groupings include in each ANOVA and related information is provided in the
Figure legends:
“Growth of each bacterial strain at different zinc concentrations was
compared using ANOVA with Bonferroni simultaneous comparisons;
data were square-root transformed for analysis to meet the
assumptions of the method. Significant differences are indicated by
different letters shown above the graphs; letters apply only within
the group compared by each ANOVA, i.e. within bacterial strains.
No letters are shown where ANOVAs indicated no significant
differences in growth at different zinc concentrations.” – Legend,
Figure 4 (lines 662-667). Emphasis added.
“ANOVAs were used to test for significant effects of zinc on
glucosinolate concentration within each population. Where zinc
significantly (a = 0.05) affects glucosinolate concentrations,
Bonferroni simultaneous comparisons were carried out and
significantly different means are indicated with different letters.”
Legend, Figure 3 (lines 644-647). Emphasis added.
<U+F0B7> We hope this provides clarification on the reasons behind the absence of
numbers on some bars.
If those issues can be fixed, this study will make a good contribution.
<U+F0B7> We are grateful to the Reviewer for this overall positive summary of the
importance of our work, and hope that the fixes are satisfactory.
Reviewer 5
The authors analysed four populations of the Zn hyperaccumulator N. caerulescens
which are known to accumulate different levels of Zn in their tissues. They grow
these at different Zn concentrations and measure a number of parameters
connected to bacterial disease resistance. They include some bacterial mutant
disease strains so they can evaluate the importance of Zn sensitivity to the ability of
bacteria to attack these plants. The research is interesting and the manuscript is well
written.
<U+F0B7> We thank the Reviewer for these positive remarks.
I also read the reply to the answers of the three previous referees and I agree with
referee 3 about the fact that it could be important to understand which type of
glucosinolates are produced. In a previous work de Graaf et al 2014 Phytochemistry
110 (2015) 166–171 different Noccaea caeurulescens populations accumulating and
non-accumulating also different metals (Zn, Cd, Ni) were analysed by NMR and MS
as far as the concentration of different glucosinolates are concerned. Among those
there are also the populations used in this study. The authors concluded that there
was no apparent relation between the level of soil pollution at the location of origin,
and the presence of glucomoringin. So this work needs at least to be commented in
light also of your findings in the discussion section.
<U+F0B7> We agree that investigation of the types of glucosinolates produced by the
different populations would be of interest in future work. It is not within the
scope & timeframe of the current revision to carry out HPLC and NMR
experiments, so we agree that this point should be considered in the
Discussion section of our MS. Although we have already cited and discussed
the paper mentioned, we have now expanded our remarks on this topic, as
follows:
“Although it must be remembered that the assay used in this work
does not distinguish between different types of glucosinolate, we
demonstrate that Psm is sensitive to inhibition by allyl
isothiocyanate, the product of sinigrin hydrolysis, as previously
reported (64). This supports the idea that release of glucosinolates
through cell death contributes to inhibition of Psm growth. Sinigrin
is known to be produced by N. caerulescens, albeit in relatively low
quantities compared to sinalbin, which is less toxic to Psm (64, 65).
However, certain accessions of N. caerulescens, including Ganges,
produce glucomoringin as a major glucosinolate, the isothiocyanate
of which has been reported to have potent anti-microbial activity
(65). De Graaf et al. (65) found that the Prayon population was one
of only three accessions studied in which sinalbin, rather than
glucomoringin, was the main glucosinolate present. These three
populations were linked not by metal accumulation phenotype or
soil type, but only by geographic closeness, and it is proposed that
the dominance of sinalbin reflects a regional genetic difference
shared by these populations (65). Although Viviez and Wilwerwiltz
plants were not included in the study, they are not from the same
geographic region as Prayon, and so are likely to more closely
resemble Ganges plants, in which glucomoringin dominates. If it is
true that Prayon plants are distinct among the four populations in
the current work in lacking glucomoringin, this could explain why
they are also the most dependent on metal-based defences. Thus
it would be interesting to study the glucosinolate profiles of all four
populations to confirm the hypothesis that Prayon is an outlier in
lacking glucomoringin, and to determine the effect of
glucomoringin-derived isothiocyanates on Psm.” (Discussion, lines
356-367)
