General comments
Social learning has seen a vast increase in interest over the past decade. Previous work has shown
that social learning is widespread in the animal kingdom. Studies that increase our knowledge
about the variability and diversity of social learning in different species will help us better
understand how social learning evolves, what costs and benefits it incurs, and how it might help
to generate, establish, and maintain traditions and culture. In the present study, the authors used
a novel extractive foraging task to investigate the capacity of social learning in otter species. They
also tested whether the otters used one of two different social learning strategies (the conditional
use of social learning), i.e. ‘copy when asocial learning is costly’ and ‘copy when young.’ In an
effort to overcome the difficulties in observing social learning events in otters the authors use
recently developed statistical tools (namely, Network-based diffusion analysis).
While the idea of the present paper is very interesting it is not ready for publication. The largest
problems regard the sample size and the different experimental designs between the tested
species. These problems cast doubt upon the overall findings of this study. This will require that
the authors revise their manuscript and potentially collect more data. At the current stage,
however, the manuscript does not meet the criteria for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Detailed comments
Behavioural experiments are always difficult to conduct, as experimental days might differ in
conditions and individuals in their motivation to participate. These problems can usually be
overcome by increasing the sample size of the study. This is the first criticism of the present
study. For one of the two tested species (L. perspicillata), there exists effectively only one
repetition (only one family group). Given the individual variability that might exist between
groups, it is difficult to see that this group provides enough evidence to support the general
claims made about the species’ use of social learning. Also, the presented data are not sufficient to
show that L. perspicillata uses a ‘copy when young’ strategy. The single group of L. perspicillata
consists of two parents and five offspring, which are also adult and young respectively. It is not
clear whether there might be a general difference in motivation in participating in the experiment
between parents and offspring, with age being less important. With the current results of only a
single group (ll. 220), this cannot be separated.
However, what is more troubling is the fact that the authors used two different experimental
designs for L. perspicillata and A. cinereus (different boxes with potentially different difficulty
used; different number of tasks). The authors state that they changed the experimental design for
A. cinereus because the order the tasks were presented to L. perspicillata might have confounded
the results (ll. 313). While the authors claim that initial experimental design gave evidence for
social learning in L. perspicillata, the altered experimental design for A. cinereus did not. For this
to be acceptable the authors need to provide a solid justification that the results from the changed
experimental design are comparable with the results from the initial setup.
Further comments
Introduction
ll. 39: This sentence needs rephrasing.
l. 55: The authors refer to ‘theory’, but reference an overview article that refers both to theoretical
and empirical studies. While this article discusses original theoretical work, it might be useful to
cite common primary sources here, e.g. Boyd and Richerson, Feldman, Aoki, etc.
ll. 56: It is not clear why the authors refer to ‘copy when uncertain’ strategy for situations where a
social learning individual is in an unknown environment. This might be better described by the
‘copy when no prior knowledge exists’ strategy.
ll. 64: This sentence needs rephrasing. Is it saying that social learning strategies depend on
different factors, or that they might be present in the tested species?
3
ll. 65: It would be generally advisable to reference studies showing social learning in the named
groups. Also, while the authors rightly pointed out that otters have been neglected in social
learning research they neglected a considerable number of studies on social learning research in
invertebrates.
ll. 76: The authors state that a wide variety of foraging techniques exist in otter populations but
do not reference any primary sources to back up this claim.
ll. 83-88: Like the comment under ll. 282–292 the life history information seems out of place and
unconnected to the rest of the paragraph.
Methods
While there is information about the individual tasks given in the figure captions, there is no
information about the dimensions of the containers and the amount of food given. Also, there is
no information whether the tasks were presented additional to the normal feeding of the otter
groups, or whether individuals were kept hungry to increase motivation to participate and solve
the tasks. Detailed information about the tasks (they are central to the entire study) should be
clearly presented in the methods. From the provided images it appears that L. perspicillata
opened empty boxes whereas A. cinereus opened boxes containing food items.
ll. 120: While additional information can be found in the SI there are no information about the
time of year (dates) stated when the experiments were conducted.
ll. 131: The calculation of the association index is not clear enough presented.
ll. 173: How is the data coded? I.e. parent=1, offspring=0; female=1, male=0?
Results
ll. 213: It is not clear where this result is documented in the results (tables?).
ll. 266: This description is less precise and too generalising. The description in ll. 244 is much
better and more precise.
ll. 270: This sentence needs to be rephrased.
Discussion
l. 279: This sentence is not informative, nor does it give any support for why otters are an
important and understudied species in the context of social learning. The argument can be found
scattered throughout the discussion, but with the current structure, it is hard to follow it.
ll. 282–292: Again, with the current structure the life history information are out of place here.
They are discussed much later starting in l. 340.
ll. 299: The argument made here that V-shaped formations require per definition social
information transmission is not intuitively plausible. Migrating birds also fly in V-shaped
formations but do so based on experienced air resistance.
ll. 301–309: The authors state that L. perspicillata do not require extensive extractive foraging
behaviours whereas A. cinereus do require extensive foraging techniques. Would it not be more
plausible to assume that the latter is more likely to acquire these techniques through social
learning?
l. 312: There is no information provided on the individual or group performance for the
increasing task difficulty. Though, it would certainly be interesting.
l. 346: Given that all individuals from these groups already reached sexual maturity, how do the
authors justify that their data shows that this species does not use ‘copy when young’?
ll. 356: This statement directly contradicts the previous line of argument where the authors claim
that only one of the two tested species uses social learning (‘learning from each other’) to exploit
novel food sources.
Supplementary information
It is great that the authors supplied the R code for their data analysis. However, in its current
form the code cannot be executed because dependencies (which packages are used?) are missing
from the code. Furthermore, the code loads the file ‘AICsmoothinput.csv’, which is not provided.

Surprisingly, there is little known about social learning capacities in otter species, making this
study a useful contribution to the behavioral ecology and comparative psychology literature.
The authors’ investigation will be of interest a broad audience, including wildlife management
practitioners. Their methodology, NBDA, represents rigorous(and well documented) approach
for assessing the transmission of novel behaviors. I felt the evidence provided support the
conclusions drawn, and writing style is accessible for a wide audience. While the authors were
clear in laying out their aims: testing for the presence of social transmission in a novel foraging
task and which strategy was used, my only criticism is that the manuscript would benefit from
a more thorough discussion of how this knowledge of social transmission capacities can be
applied. I think the manuscript would benefit from a more thorough exploration potential
applications for reintroduction given otters’ vulnerable status. I think both the introduction
and discussion could be bolstered with a more in depth information on specific vulnerable
status of the otters, the role that social learning may have with reintroduction programs, and
how the social learning strategies have implications for reintroduction.
Comments
Line 32: I think it may be more appropriate for new readers to describe how animals can use
individual learning mechanisms(like trial and error learning) or socially mediated mechanisms to
guide their daily decisions.
Line 92: See work by Estes on Pacific Evol Ecol Res 11: 841-869 (2009) but their study may not
directly test social transmission.
Line 95: How could their learning tendencies be applied. Can we seed experienced foragers, and
if so should it be a certain age/sex class? Questions like this can be directly applied and of
interest to wildlife managers/conservation biologists.
Line 164: I can see the value of transparency for listing you used OADA first, but it may be more
streamlined to just go right to TADA
5
Line 356: I found this paragraph interesting and could potentially have more details on the types
of foraging tasks that may enhance wild survival. Or other practical tips for practitioners.

Comments to the Author:
As reviewer 2 highlights, there is little information about social learning in this taxa, which makes
this study potentially interesting. However, there are a number of issues with the current version
6
as highlighted by reviewer 2. Moreover, there needs to be considerably more attention to the
methods and results to provide adequate information about the study design and the analyses.
For example, the association matrices appear to be constructed from 5 minute observation
intervals. These observations are not independent and likely result in pseudo-replication. The
authors need to be able to demonstrate that they have adequately sampled the network. It is not
clear whether only a single 'task' was presented to the group each day- and if so then it is not
clear how multiple individuals engaged (or could engage) with the task. Figure 4 needs improved
formatting (particularly the clarity of the axes). Descriptive data about time to solve in both
species would be useful (i.e. if the short-clawed otters are learning sociality, it should take them
longer to solve the task). The clarity of the language needs to be improved throughout the
manuscript but this is particularly germane in the results section as it is very difficult to follow.

This is an interesting manuscript that extends research into social learning strategies—i.e., the
conditional use of social learning in ways predicted to be adaptive—into a previously neglected
taxon: otters. Beyond highlighting otters as a potentially valuable group in which to perform
comparative studies on the evolution of social learning strategies, the approaches used in this
work likely have broad relevance for conservation efforts in these and other threatened species.
While the manuscript is well-organized and generally well-written, there are a few topics I would
like to see handled more carefully and a couple additional analyses I believe may be valuable to
perform.
First, species-level comparisons should be done very cautiously here, especially given that these
results are based on only one data point for one species and three for the other. The authors
generally acknowledge the limitations of their data (e.g., lines 333-334; 362-365; 374-378), but I
believe additional caution may be warranted. For example, the strong effect of social transmission
identified in the smooth-coated otters (SC) was explained as fitting their natural history as
cooperative hunters that likely need to attend closely to social cues (lines 335-346). However, had
the Asian small-clawed otter (ASC) groups had stronger evidence of social transmission, it seems
an equivalent post-hoc justification could have been crafted. The prey of ASC includes crabs and
shellfish that require extractive foraging behaviors, and the potential importance of social
learning in the development of such behaviors, particularly in juveniles, has been documented in
several species, including black rats (Terkel, 1996, In: Social Learning in Animals), meerkats
(Thornton & McAuliffe, 2006, Science), and chimpanzees (Biro et al., 2006, In: Cognitive
10
Development in Chimpanzees). It remains plausible that if groups of ASC had included otters
aged 1-2 years old, a similarly strong social transmission effect relative to the SC group may have
been identified. This emphasizes further need to be cautious with species-level comparisons, as
species here is confounded with age. Again, the authors acknowledge this (lines 387-390), but this
element of the data greatly limits the extent to which inferences about species differences can be
drawn. Given the above limitations, I would like to see more emphasis on alternative
explanations with the intent to generate hypotheses for future studies.
Regarding the analysis, I have two major comments. First, rather than make broad, qualitative
statements regarding differences in network structure between SC and ASC groups (lines 214-
217; 258-261), it would seem preferable to conduct randomizations tests to quantitatively assess
whether observed network structures differ from null expectations. Another possibility would be
to include a measure of social differentiation for each network as a quantitative estimate of how
structured (or homogeneous) it is (see Heathcote et al., 2017, Scientific Reports for a recent
example of this measure being used).
Second, I would like to see some justification for how task difficulties were ranked. For example,
it’s not clear to me why task 5 is presumed more difficult than task 4 for the SC group (Figure 1).
Would it be possible to use NBDA to provide a more objective means of assessing task difficulty?
Presumably, more difficult tasks would have lower baseline solving rates than less difficult tasks.
In the description of the dTADA in the supplementary material, the authors even state that task
was included as an individual-level variable to account for variation in task difficulty. Can the
estimated baseline acquisition rates for each task be presented and compared?
Beyond the larger points discussed above, I had a variety of minor comments and suggestions
about elements of the manuscript, which I address below.
Lines 19-20: “more complex prey” is a vague phrase. Perhaps change to something like “prey
requiring more extractive foraging behaviors”
Lines 22-23: “and [may] adopt a ‘copy when young’ strategy”
At the end of the first paragraph in the Introduction, it may be helpful to point out why social
learning strategies are an important focus of current social learning research (e.g., indiscriminate
social learning may often be not adaptive).
Lines 39-42: This sentence reads very awkwardly, given the inclusion of two semi-colons. Please
rewrite.
Lines 48-52: Another example of ‘copy-older-individuals’ is nine-spined sticklebacks copying
patch choices (Duffy et al., 2009, Animal Behaviour).
Lines 63-67: The Dugatkin & Godin (1993) reference cited earlier fits nicely as an example here as
well.
Lines 68-70: It may be helpful to clarify why species are expected to differ in the social learning
strategies they employ.
Lines 91-93: Is there any information on how ASC otters develop their foraging techniques? As
discussed above, might it be plausible that extractive foraging techniques used on crabs and
shellfish may be socially transmitted from adults to young ASC otters?
Lines 94-103: I really like this paragraph! It provides a nice justification for this work and future
studies in this vein.
11
Lines 104-107: It seems doubtful to me that the lack of research on otter social learning is because
keepers couldn’t (or didn’t wish to) separate their animals for training and demonstration
sessions. NBDA has been fairly well-established at this point as a useful method for inferring
social transmission in freely-interacting groups, so perhaps it’s enough to simply state that the
possibility of social learning in these groups was investigated here via NBDA.
Line 126: Clarify that N here means the number of individuals per group (and not the number of
groups).
Lines 133-134: Is there justification for one body-length as the measure of association? Is social
transmission plausible over farther distances? Was a chain-rule employed?
Lines 137-140: The denominator for the simple ratio index should be the number of samples
individuals were observed apart plus the number of samples in which they were associating.
Currently, only the former is included in the manuscript.
Lines 160-163: As mentioned earlier, could baseline rates in the NBDA be used to assess how
difficult the tasks actually were for the otters, rather than subjectively assigning ‘difficulty’? If
not, could more justification be provided for the difficulty rankings?
Lines 180-200: For readers unfamiliar with NBDA, it may be helpful to include a brief discussion
of how NBDA estimates the effect of social transmission.
Lines 214-217: As mentioned earlier, carrying out a randomization test or including an estimate of
social differentiation would allow for a more quantitative assessment of whether “individuals
differed greatly in how much they associated with each other”.
Lines 221-223: Please clarify whether these weights are for the top social and asocial models or
whether they are summed across all of the multiplicative social transmission models and asocial
models respectively?
Lines 226-227: How can 100% of the task solves occur through social transmission, given that the
initial solves occurred via asocial learning? Or do these estimates only include solving events that
occurred after the first solve within each diffusion? Please clarify.
Lines 258-261: Again, I think randomization tests/social differentiation estimates would be
valuable here.
Lines 294-295; 299: Again, please clarify whether the initial solvers were included in the estimated
% of solves that occurred via social transmission.
Lines 314-317: It is stated by the authors later on (lines 388-391), but the caveat that ‘young’ otters
in the ASC groups were quite a bit older than those in the SC group makes me question the
validity of this comparison.
Line 331: ...smooth-coated otters [can?] learn from each other...
Line 334: ‘unprecedented’ seems a tad strong. Perhaps ‘novel insights’ instead?
Lines 341-346: As discussed earlier, it seems plausible that an argument could be made that
complex extractive foraging tasks might be predicted to promote reliance on social information,
especially in juveniles.
Lines 364-365: In addition to a randomized task order, testing several groups of both species
would be necessary to truly provide good support for such a conclusion.
12
Lines 371-378: These results are consistent with ‘copy-when-young’, but provide only weak
support for this strategy. It would be better to compare social transmission rates per unit of
network connection within and between classes of individuals within a network (e.g., Farine et
al., 2015, Current Biology). I would like to see more discussion of alternative explanations for
why young individuals had a higher solving rate. As mentioned, younger individuals might be
more motivated to contact the tasks, particularly given that the first solver was always a young
individual in the SC group. Is it plausible that younger individuals exhibited less neophobia than
older individuals or were more likely to engage in play behavior? Could older individuals have
experienced little positive reinforcement over their lifespan that promoted engagement with
novel elements of their enclosures?
Lines 390-392: Additional studies on both species—not just ASC otters—would be needed.
Lines 590-593: The text and image for figure 1, items 5 & 6, don’t match.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
The manuscript was sent to one of the original reviewers. They still have some concerns,
particularly with the inferences drawn from a limited samples size. The authors need to explicitly
acknowledge that the demography, history and composition of captive groups may or may not
reflect the range of groups in the wild- and that the demographic composition may affect the
behaviours of the group. To address this concern, the species level inferences need to be toned
down to clarify that there are differences in these groups, which may or may not reflect species
differences.

Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting manuscript that extends research into social learning strategies—i.e., the
conditional use of social learning in ways predicted to be adaptive—into a previously neglected
taxon: otters. Beyond highlighting otters as a potentially valuable group in which to perform
comparative studies on the evolution of social learning strategies, the approaches used in this
work likely have broad relevance for conservation efforts in these and other threatened species.
While the manuscript is well-organized and generally well-written, there are a few topics I would
like to see handled more carefully and a couple additional analyses I believe may be valuable to
perform.
First, species-level comparisons should be done very cautiously here, especially given that these
results are based on only one data point for one species and three for the other. The authors
15
generally acknowledge the limitations of their data (e.g., lines 333-334; 362-365; 374-378), but I
believe additional caution may be warranted. For example, the strong effect of social transmission
identified in the smooth-coated otters (SC) was explained as fitting their natural history as
cooperative hunters that likely need to attend closely to social cues (lines 335-346). However, had
the Asian small-clawed otter (ASC) groups had stronger evidence of social transmission, it seems
an equivalent post-hoc justification could have been crafted. The prey of ASC includes crabs and
shellfish that require extractive foraging behaviors, and the potential importance of social
learning in the development of such behaviors, particularly in juveniles, has been documented in
several species, including black rats (Terkel, 1996, In: Social Learning in Animals), meerkats
(Thornton & McAuliffe, 2006, Science), and chimpanzees (Biro et al., 2006, In: Cognitive
Development in Chimpanzees). It remains plausible that if groups of ASC had included otters
aged 1-2 years old, a similarly strong social transmission effect relative to the SC group may have
been identified. This emphasizes further need to be cautious with species-level comparisons, as
species here is confounded with age. Again, the authors acknowledge this (lines 387-390), but this
element of the data greatly limits the extent to which inferences about species differences can be
drawn. Given the above limitations, I would like to see more emphasis on alternative
explanations with the intent to generate hypotheses for future studies.
Regarding the analysis, I have two major comments. First, rather than make broad, qualitative
statements regarding differences in network structure between SC and ASC groups (lines 214-
217; 258-261), it would seem preferable to conduct randomizations tests to quantitatively assess
whether observed network structures differ from null expectations. Another possibility would be
to include a measure of social differentiation for each network as a quantitative estimate of how
structured (or homogeneous) it is (see Heathcote et al., 2017, Scientific Reports for a recent
example of this measure being used).
Second, I would like to see some justification for how task difficulties were ranked. For example,
it’s not clear to me why task 5 is presumed more difficult than task 4 for the SC group (Figure 1).
Would it be possible to use NBDA to provide a more objective means of assessing task difficulty?
Presumably, more difficult tasks would have lower baseline solving rates than less difficult tasks.
In the description of the dTADA in the supplementary material, the authors even state that task
was included as an individual-level variable to account for variation in task difficulty. Can the
estimated baseline acquisition rates for each task be presented and compared?
Beyond the larger points discussed above, I had a variety of minor comments and suggestions
about elements of the manuscript, which I address below.
Lines 19-20: “more complex prey” is a vague phrase. Perhaps change to something like “prey
requiring more extractive foraging behaviors”
Lines 22-23: “and [may] adopt a ‘copy when young’ strategy”
At the end of the first paragraph in the Introduction, it may be helpful to point out why social
learning strategies are an important focus of current social learning research (e.g., indiscriminate
social learning may often be not adaptive).
Lines 39-42: This sentence reads very awkwardly, given the inclusion of two semi-colons. Please
rewrite.
Lines 48-52: Another example of ‘copy-older-individuals’ is nine-spined sticklebacks copying
patch choices (Duffy et al., 2009, Animal Behaviour).
Lines 63-67: The Dugatkin & Godin (1993) reference cited earlier fits nicely as an example here as
well.
16
Lines 68-70: It may be helpful to clarify why species are expected to differ in the social learning
strategies they employ.
Lines 91-93: Is there any information on how ASC otters develop their foraging techniques? As
discussed above, might it be plausible that extractive foraging techniques used on crabs and
shellfish may be socially transmitted from adults to young ASC otters?
Lines 94-103: I really like this paragraph! It provides a nice justification for this work and future
studies in this vein.
Lines 104-107: It seems doubtful to me that the lack of research on otter social learning is because
keepers couldn’t (or didn’t wish to) separate their animals for training and demonstration
sessions. NBDA has been fairly well-established at this point as a useful method for inferring
social transmission in freely-interacting groups, so perhaps it’s enough to simply state that the
possibility of social learning in these groups was investigated here via NBDA.
Line 126: Clarify that N here means the number of individuals per group (and not the number of
groups).
Lines 133-134: Is there justification for one body-length as the measure of association? Is social
transmission plausible over farther distances? Was a chain-rule employed?
Lines 137-140: The denominator for the simple ratio index should be the number of samples
individuals were observed apart plus the number of samples in which they were associating.
Currently, only the former is included in the manuscript.
Lines 160-163: As mentioned earlier, could baseline rates in the NBDA be used to assess how
difficult the tasks actually were for the otters, rather than subjectively assigning ‘difficulty’? If
not, could more justification be provided for the difficulty rankings?
Lines 180-200: For readers unfamiliar with NBDA, it may be helpful to include a brief discussion
of how NBDA estimates the effect of social transmission.
Lines 214-217: As mentioned earlier, carrying out a randomization test or including an estimate of
social differentiation would allow for a more quantitative assessment of whether “individuals
differed greatly in how much they associated with each other”.
Lines 221-223: Please clarify whether these weights are for the top social and asocial models or
whether they are summed across all of the multiplicative social transmission models and asocial
models respectively?
Lines 226-227: How can 100% of the task solves occur through social transmission, given that the
initial solves occurred via asocial learning? Or do these estimates only include solving events that
occurred after the first solve within each diffusion? Please clarify.
Lines 258-261: Again, I think randomization tests/social differentiation estimates would be
valuable here.
Lines 294-295; 299: Again, please clarify whether the initial solvers were included in the estimated
% of solves that occurred via social transmission.
Lines 314-317: It is stated by the authors later on (lines 388-391), but the caveat that ‘young’ otters
in the ASC groups were quite a bit older than those in the SC group makes me question the
validity of this comparison.
Line 331: ...smooth-coated otters [can?] learn from each other...
17
Line 334: ‘unprecedented’ seems a tad strong. Perhaps ‘novel insights’ instead?
Lines 341-346: As discussed earlier, it seems plausible that an argument could be made that
complex extractive foraging tasks might be predicted to promote reliance on social information,
especially in juveniles.
Lines 364-365: In addition to a randomized task order, testing several groups of both species
would be necessary to truly provide good support for such a conclusion.
Lines 371-378: These results are consistent with ‘copy-when-young’, but provide only weak
support for this strategy. It would be better to compare social transmission rates per unit of
network connection within and between classes of individuals within a network (e.g., Farine et
al., 2015, Current Biology). I would like to see more discussion of alternative explanations for
why young individuals had a higher solving rate. As mentioned, younger individuals might be
more motivated to contact the tasks, particularly given that the first solver was always a young
individual in the SC group. Is it plausible that younger individuals exhibited less neophobia than
older individuals or were more likely to engage in play behavior? Could older individuals have
experienced little positive reinforcement over their lifespan that promoted engagement with
novel elements of their enclosures?
Lines 390-392: Additional studies on both species—not just ASC otters—would be needed.
Lines 590-593: The text and image for figure 1, items 5 & 6, don’t match.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
Comments to the Author:
As reviewer 2 highlights, there is little information about social learning in this taxa, which makes
this study potentially interesting. However, there are a number of issues with the current version as
highlighted by reviewer 1. Moreover, there needs to be considerably more attention to the methods
and results to provide adequate information about the study design and the analyses.
We thank the Associate Editor for their interest in our study and for their constructive comments.
We have now modified the manuscript to solve the above mentioned issues, particularly with
regards to the Methods and Results sections, as outlined below.
For example, the association matrices appear to be constructed from 5 minute observation intervals.
These observations are not independent and likely result in pseudo-replication. The authors need to
be able to demonstrate that they have adequately sampled the network.
The number of sampling periods used does not enter into the Network-Based Diffusion Analysis
(NBDA), so there is no way in which use of non-independent points to create the social network
would result in a pseudo-replication effect due to somehow artificially inflating sample size. There
is also no possibility that collecting data “too often” could bias the social network. Collection of
social network data using instantaneous sampling is just the same as any other use of
instantaneous sampling. It is well established that the shorter the sampling period, the better your
estimates of time spent in a given state will be (see Martin & Bateson (1993) Measuring
Behaviour: An Introductory Guide. Cambridge University Press). The non-independence just means
that it is a waste of effort to collect data too often- and 5 mins was a compromise that allowed
time for otters to be identified accurately.
Admittedly, frequent sampling could result in standard errors that are too small, if these
are calculated naively assuming that data points are independent- but we do not require standard
errors on network connections for our NBDA (nor are these routinely provided in animal Social
Network Analysis).
A valid concern here is that the data were collected over a long enough period to be
representative of the otters’ social network connections at the time of the diffusion experiments.
We argue that this was the case for our study, with data being collected over five days with three
separate periods of one hour per day, summing to a total of fifteen hours of observation per otter
group. Thus the measured network is likely to have been a good measure of the social network at
the time the diffusion studies were run.
Furthermore, it is worth noting that if not enough data were collected, then this would
result in noise in the social network. Simulations run by Hoppitt (paper submitted to Phil Trans R
Soc B) show that NBDA is robust to noise in the social network, that noise acts to slightly reduce
power to detect social learning and results in a slightly conservative estimate of the importance of
social learning. Thus, even if, contrary to our claim, the social network we used was not an
accurate depiction of the real social network, this cannot have resulted in a spurious social
learning effect in the smooth-coated otters.
We now explain why some non-independence in the association data do not bias the
Network-Based Diffusion Analysis (NBDA) results in lines 141-148.
It is not clear whether only a single 'task' was presented to the group each day- and if so then it is
not clear how multiple individuals engaged (or could engage) with the task.
To further clarify this, we now use “task type” to refer to the different tasks (i.e. as depicted in
Figures 1 and 2), and “task apparatus” to refer to identical replicas of the same task; please see
revised lines 153-178.
Figure 4 needs improved formatting (particularly the clarity of the axes).
We have now re-drawn this figure to improve the formatting and clarify the axes. We have also
modified it to facilitate interpretation: we have added a blue dotted line showing the AVERAGE
(rather than TOTAL) social network connection to informed individuals among the offspring – so
the route we would expect the red line to take if learning were asocial, and assuming the young to
be faster at individual learning. If learning is social, we would expect the red line to be clearly
above the blue dotted line. This is the case for tasks 1-4, but not for tasks 5-6, thus suggesting that
the first were solved through social learning while the latter were solved through individual
learning.
Descriptive data about time to solve in both species would be useful (i.e. if the short-clawed otters
are learning sociality, it should take them longer to solve the task).
All the raw data are provided in the Supplementary Materials. Unfortunately, time to solve is not
informative regarding the underlying learning mechanism: faster solving could result from faster
individual trial-and-error learning or from faster social learning (e.g. see Reader, S. M. (2004).
Distinguishing social and asocial learning using diffusion dynamics. Animal Learning & Behavior,
32(1), 90-104). We can only infer social learning from the spread of the task solutions through the
otter groups following the groups’ different social network structures.
The clarity of the language needs to be improved throughout the manuscript but this is particularly
germane in the results section as it is very difficult to follow.
We apologize for having caused confusion, especially in the overly-technical Results section. We
have re-written the entire Results section and edited the rest of the manuscript to improve the
clarity of the language.
Reviewers' Comments to Authors

Comments to the Author(s)
General comments
Social learning has seen a vast increase in interest over the past decade. Previous work has shown
that social learning is widespread in the animal kingdom. Studies that increase our knowledge about
the variability and diversity of social learning in different species will help us better understand how
social learning evolves, what costs and benefits it incurs, and how it might help to generate,
establish, and maintain traditions and culture. In the present study, the authors used a novel
extractive foraging task to investigate the capacity of social learning in otter species. They also
tested whether the otters used one of two different social learning strategies (the conditional use of
social learning), i.e. ‘copy when asocial learning is costly’ and ‘copy when young.’ In an effort to
overcome the difficulties in observing social learning events in otters the authors use recently
developed statistical tools (namely, Network-based diffusion analysis).
While the idea of the present paper is very interesting it is not ready for publication. The largest
problems regard the sample size and the different experimental designs between the tested species.
These problems cast doubt upon the overall findings of this study. This will require that the authors
revise their manuscript and potentially collect more data. At the current stage, however, the
manuscript does not meet the criteria for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
We thank the reviewer for their interest in our work. We acknowledge the potential issues
regarding experimental design, and now describe additional analyses and results to show that the
difference in task order and task number between the two otter species does not change the
results qualitatively (please see below for details). We hope that these results and the revised
Results section meet the reviewer’s request for manuscript revisions and reassure the reviewer of
the robustness of our results.
Detailed comments
Behavioural experiments are always difficult to conduct, as experimental days might differ in
conditions and individuals in their motivation to participate. These problems can usually be
overcome by increasing the sample size of the study. This is the first criticism of the present study.
For one of the two tested species (L. perspicillata), there exists effectively only one repetition (only
one family group). Given the individual variability that might exist between groups, it is difficult to
see that this group provides enough evidence to support the general claims made about the species’
use of social learning.
Showing evidence of social learning in one group is sufficient to provide evidence that this species
is capable of social learning, even if it does not show how common it is across the species as a
whole. The results of our Network-Based Diffusion Analysis show that the pattern within this
group is unlikely to have arisen by asocial learning and chance alone despite the limited sample
size. We also emphasize throughout the manuscript that our study requires replication in a larger
sample to assess the generality of our findings – please see e.g. lines 305-307, 333-334, 374-378
and 391-392.
Also, the presented data are not sufficient to show that L. perspicillata uses a ‘copy when young’
strategy. The single group of L. perspicillata consists of two parents and five offspring, which are also
adult and young respectively. It is not clear whether there might be a general difference in
motivation in participating in the experiment between parents and offspring, with age being less
important. With the current results of only a single group (ll. 220), this cannot be separated.
The reviewer makes a fair point in identifying that this pattern may be a property of the single
group studied, and that further work is required to show that L. perspicillata generally adopts a
‘copy when young’ strategy. We have edited our text to make it clear that the (statistically
significant) result in our group suggests that such a strategy may be in operation, but that further
work is required to investigate whether this is a strategy generally adopted in this species, or
whether our finding is due to a potential confound (e.g. differences in motivation, that happen to
map onto age in this particular group); please see lines 374-378.
However, what is more troubling is the fact that the authors used two different experimental
designs for L. perspicillata and A. cinereus (different boxes with potentially different difficulty used;
different number of tasks). The authors state that they changed the experimental design for A.
cinereus because the order the tasks were presented to L. perspicillata might have confounded the
results (ll. 313). While the authors claim that initial experimental design gave evidence for social
learning in L. perspicillata, the altered experimental design for A. cinereus did not. For this to be
acceptable the authors need to provide a solid justification that the results from the changed
experimental design are comparable with the results from the initial setup.
We have now re-run the analyses comparing the strength of social transmission in the two species,
but using only data from the tasks that required the same actions to be solved: smooth-coated
otters: tasks 1, 3, 4 (Fig. 1) and Asian short-clawed otters: tasks 1, 2, 3 (Fig. 2). These new analyses,
described in lines 290-307, replicate the original results that smooth-coated otters relied on social
transmission in virtually all of their task solves while Asian-short clawed otters virtually never did
so (see Table 2). This is still the case when we remove the screw-top task where smooth-coated
otters were given an opaque version while Asian short-clawed otters were presented with a
transparent one (please see lines 296 –303). We hope that these more stringent and conservative
analyses alleviate the reviewer’s concerns regarding the different (numbers of) tasks presented to
the two species. With regards to the species difference in the order in which tasks were presented,
we struggle to imagine a scenario where this would have altered the evidence for social learning
across all task types, which is what the Network-Based Diffusion Analysis tests for.
Further comments
Introduction
ll. 39: This sentence needs rephrasing.
We have rephrased this to improve clarity: please see revised lines 39-42.
l. 55: The authors refer to ‘theory’, but reference an overview article that refers both to theoretical
and empirical studies. While this article discusses original theoretical work, it might be useful to cite
common primary sources here, e.g. Boyd and Richerson, Feldman, Aoki, etc.
We have changed the reference accordingly (line 57).
ll. 56: It is not clear why the authors refer to ‘copy when uncertain’ strategy for situations where a
social learning individual is in an unknown environment. This might be better described by the ‘copy
when no prior knowledge exists’ strategy.
Although we agree that this strategy could also be called a ‘copy in the absence of relevant prior
knowledge’ strategy, we prefer to follow the established literature here, where this strategy is
referred to as the ‘copy when uncertain’ strategy (see Laland (2004) Social Learning Strategies.
Learning & Behavior 32 (1), 4-14).
ll. 64: This sentence needs rephrasing. Is it saying that social learning strategies depend on different
factors, or that they might be present in the tested species?
We were trying to make the point that the specific ‘who’ and ‘when’ social learning strategies
employed depend on various factors, and that these factors may differ between species. We hope
the revised sentence has clarified this (lines 69-70).
ll. 65: It would be generally advisable to reference studies showing social learning in the named
groups. Also, while the authors rightly pointed out that otters have been neglected in social learning
research they neglected a considerable number of studies on social learning research in
invertebrates.
We have added four review articles (references 23-26; please see lines 71-72) that describe social
learning strategies in each of the named groups, now including insects (reviewed by Grüter &
Leadbeater (2014) in TREE: ref 26).
ll. 76: The authors state that a wide variety of foraging techniques exist in otter populations but do
not reference any primary sources to back up this claim.
We have now revised this sentence to state: “Given the variety of dietary and foraging
specializations observed in different otter populations (28), it seems plausible that they may be
socially transmitted between individuals (29).” and added the following two references to back up
this claim:
28. Tinker MT, Bentall G, Estes JA. 2008 Food limitation leads to behavioral diversification and
dietary specialization in sea otters. PNAS 105, 560–5.
29. Tinker MT, Mangel M, Estes JA. 2009 Learning to be different: Acquired skills, social
learning, frequency dependence, and environmental variation can cause behaviourally
mediated foraging specializations. Evol Ecol Res. 11, 841–69.
ll. 83-88: Like the comment under ll. 282–292 the life history information seems out of place and
unconnected to the rest of the paragraph.
We have removed the life history information from this section.
Methods
While there is information about the individual tasks given in the figure captions, there is no
information about the dimensions of the containers and the amount of food given.
This information is now provided in the Figure Legends.
Also, there is no information whether the tasks were presented additional to the normal feeding of
the otter groups, or whether individuals were kept hungry to increase motivation to participate and
solve the tasks.
This information is now provided in lines 165-166.
Detailed information about the tasks (they are central to the entire study) should be clearly
presented in the methods. From the provided images it appears that L. perspicillata opened empty
boxes whereas A. cinereus opened boxes containing food items.
The food rewards contained in each task type, and the task apparatus dimensions, are described in
the Figure Legends.
ll. 120: While additional information can be found in the SI there are no information about the time
of year (dates) stated when the experiments were conducted.
We have now added the dates and times at which the tasks were presented to Tables S2 and S3 in
the Supplementary Materials.
ll. 131: The calculation of the association index is not clear enough presented.
We have now clarified this by stating: “where each otter dyad’s ‘association index’ was computed
as the simple ratio of the total number of five-minute samples that the two otters were observed
within one body length of each other, divided by the total number of five-minute samples those
individuals were observed apart (the ‘Simple Ratio Index’; (37)).” (lines 137-140).
ll. 173: How is the data coded? I.e. parent=1, offspring=0; female=1, male=0?
Yes this is correct – we have now added this information to the main text (line 192-193).
Results
ll. 213: It is not clear where this result is documented in the results (tables?).
This result is based on an “ad hoc visual examination” of the graphs presented in Figure 4, as well
as fitting a model without social transmission to the solving data for tasks 5 and 6. We have now
modified Figure 4 to clarify these patterns, and clarified the Figure legend as well as the text in
accompanying lines 232-242.
ll. 266: This description is less precise and too generalising. The description in ll. 244 is much better
and more precise.
We have now changed this to: “Therefore, overall our results strongly suggest that social
transmission was less likely to be an important factor in the spread of task solutions in Asian short-
clawed otters than in smooth-coated otters” (lines 303-305).
ll. 270: This sentence needs to be rephrased.
We have changed this to: “Although males and females differed in task solving rates only in Asian
short-clawed otters,” (line 309)
Discussion
l. 279: This sentence is not informative, nor does it give any support for why otters are an important
and understudied species in the context of social learning. The argument can be found scattered
throughout the discussion, but with the current structure, it is hard to follow it.
We have added a summarized justification; please see lines 320-323.
ll. 282–292: Again, with the current structure the life history information are out of place here. They
are discussed much later starting in l. 340.
We have removed this section from the main text and have added the relevant information on age
at first reproduction to the later section (lines 381-382).
ll. 299: The argument made here that V-shaped formations require per definition social information
transmission is not intuitively plausible. Migrating birds also fly in V-shaped formations but do so
based on experienced air resistance.
We have changed “V-shaped swimming patterns” into “creek-wide aligned swimming patterns”
(line 337) to more accurately reflect the empirical report of this observation, and have removed
“which by definition would require social information transmission” in agreement with the
reviewer that the mechanism underlying this behaviour is unknown.
ll. 301–309: The authors state that L. perspicillata do not require extensive extractive foraging
behaviours whereas A. cinereus do require extensive foraging techniques. Would it not be more
plausible to assume that the latter is more likely to acquire these techniques through social
learning?
We describe in the Discussion (lines 342-346) that A. cinereus are not known to show group
foraging behaviours, and there would thus be few opportunities for individuals of this species to
learn from each other. There are various cases of animals performing complex extractive foraging
behaviours in nature that are not acquired through social learning; the woodpecker finch of the
Galapagos is a famous example (please see Tebbich, S., Taborsky, M., Fessl, B., & Blomqvist, D.
(2001). Do woodpecker finches acquire tool-use by social learning? Proc Roy Soc B 268, 2189-
2193).
l. 312: There is no information provided on the individual or group performance for the increasing
task difficulty. Though, it would certainly be interesting.
We describe in the Results section that the otters’ solving data provide no evidence in either
species for the social learning rate (s) to differ between tasks. We have now made this more
explicit – please see lines 229-232 and 271-274. The raw solving latencies can be found in the
Supplementary Materials.
l. 346: Given that all individuals from these groups already reached sexual maturity, how do the
authors justify that their data shows that this species does not use ‘copy when young’?
The ‘copy when young’ social learning strategy can be interpreted both in absolute terms (i.e.
biological age) or in relative terms (i.e. younger than older, and thus more experienced, group
mates). We are not claiming that our results are conclusive by any means – please see Discussion
lines 388-392: “A valid criticism of our interpretation..”
ll. 356: This statement directly contradicts the previous line of argument where the authors claim
that only one of the two tested species uses social learning (‘learning from each other’) to exploit
novel food sources.
We were referring to “otters” in the general sense of the word, but have now added “smooth-
coated” to avoid confusion (line 396).
Supplementary information
It is great that the authors supplied the R code for their data analysis. However, in its current form
the code cannot be executed because dependencies (which packages are used?) are missing from
the code. Furthermore, the code loads the file ‘AICsmoothinput.csv’, which is not provided.
Many thanks to the reviewer for pointing out this issue. We have now fixed these issues in the R
code and have also added comments to provide more guidance about the function of the different
parts of the code. We have uploaded the new R code as well as the AICsmoothinput.csv file as
supplementary materials.

Comments to the Author(s)
Surprisingly, there is little known about social learning capacities in otter species, making this
study a useful contribution to the behavioral ecology and comparative psychology literature. The
authors’ investigation will be of interest to a broad audience, including wildlife management
practitioners. Their methodology, NBDA, represents a rigorous (and well documented) approach for
assessing the transmission of novel behaviors. I felt the evidence provided support for the
conclusions drawn, and the writing style is accessible for a wide audience. While the authors were
clear in laying out their aims: testing for the presence of social transmission in a novel foraging task
and which strategy was used, my only criticism is that the manuscript would benefit from a more
thorough discussion of how this knowledge of social transmission capacities can be applied. I think
the manuscript would benefit from a more thorough exploration of potential applications for
reintroduction given otters’ vulnerable status. I think both the introduction and discussion could be
bolstered with a more in depth information on specific vulnerable status of the otters, the role that
social learning may have with reintroduction programs, and how the social learning strategies have
implications for reintroduction.
We thank the reviewer for his interest in, and positive assessment of, our manuscript. We agree
that the conservation implications are very important. However, we are hesitant to speculate too
much out of fear of misinforming conservation practitioners based on our still very limited
understanding of otter social learning. We see this study as a first glimpse into otter social
learning, and we are planning to conduct many more studies to fill in all the gaps in our current
understanding. However, in an attempt to provide a bit more information to meet the reviewer’s
request, we have added lines 98-103 and 406-417.
Comments
Line 32: I think it may be more appropriate for new readers to describe how animals can use
individual learning mechanisms(like trial and error learning) or socially mediated mechanisms to
guide their daily decisions.
We have changed this sentence accordingly; please see revised lines 31-33.
Line 92: See work by Estes on Pacific Otters (Evol Ecol Res 11: 841-869 (2009)) but their study may
not directly test social transmission.
We thank the reviewer for the reference! Unfortunately the cited paper only reports on theoretical
models suggesting that sea otters are likely to learn foraging skills from their mothers, but it
presents no empirical tests of this theoretical prediction. However, we have integrated the citation
in line 83.
Line 95: How could their learning tendencies be applied. Can we seed experienced foragers, and if so
should it be a certain age/sex class? Questions like this can be directly applied and of interest to
wildlife managers/conservation biologists.
There is, as far as we know, no information available to answer these questions, but we now
describe how knowledge of otter social learning tendencies may theoretically be useful for
conservation reintroduction practices in lines 98-103.
Line 164: I can see the value of transparency for listing you used OADA first, but it may be more
streamlined to just go right to TADA
We completely agree, and have revised the Results section accordingly. We still use OADA for
parts of the analyses though and so it does need to be described here.
Line 356: I found this paragraph interesting and could potentially have more details on the types of
foraging tasks that may enhance wild survival. Or other practical tips for practitioners.
We have attempted to add some practical tips to lines 406-417 without straying too far from our
actual findings – we would not want to misinform conservation practices so are hesitant to
speculate too much. We hope this makes sense!
Appendix B
Dear Associate Editor of Royal Society Open Science,
We would like to thank you and the anonymous reviewer for your detailed comments on our manuscript.
We have revised the manuscript accordingly, as outlined below in bold italics.
We hope that you will now find our manuscript suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Sincerely yours,
Neeltje Boogert, on behalf of Zosia Ladds and Will Hoppitt
Associate Editor Comments to Author:
The manuscript was sent to one of the original reviewers. They still have some concerns, particularly with the
inferences drawn from a limited samples size. The authors need to explicitly acknowledge that the
demography, history and composition of captive groups may or may not reflect the range of groups in the
wild- and that the demographic composition may affect the behaviours of the group. To address this concern,
the species level inferences need to be toned down to clarify that there are differences in these groups, which
may or may not reflect species differences.
Thank you for pointing out that additional caution is warranted to avoid over-interpretation of our
preliminary findings. We have now added three new sections to explicitly acknowledge the limits of our
inferences: please see Results lines 323-326, Discussion lines 342-347 and lines 360-371. We hope that these
cautionary notes meet the Reviewer’s and Editors’ requirements.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting manuscript that extends research into social learning strategies—i.e., the conditional use
of social learning in ways predicted to be adaptive—into a previously neglected taxon: otters. Beyond
highlighting otters as a potentially valuable group in which to perform comparative studies on the evolution of
social learning strategies, the approaches used in this work likely have broad relevance for conservation efforts
in these and other threatened species. While the manuscript is well-organized and generally well-written,
there are a few topics I would like to see handled more carefully and a couple additional analyses I believe may
be valuable to perform.
First, species-level comparisons should be done very cautiously here, especially given that these results are
based on only one data point for one species and three for the other. The authors generally acknowledge the
limitations of their data (e.g., lines 333-334; 362-365; 374-378), but I believe additional caution may be
warranted. For example, the strong effect of social transmission identified in the smooth-coated otters (SC)
was explained as fitting their natural history as cooperative hunters that likely need to attend closely to social
cues (lines 335-346). However, had the Asian small-clawed otter (ASC) groups had stronger evidence of social
transmission, it seems an equivalent post-hoc justification could have been crafted. The prey of ASC includes
crabs and shellfish that require extractive foraging behaviors, and the potential importance of social learning
in the development of such behaviors, particularly in juveniles, has been documented in several species,
including black rats (Terkel, 1996, In: Social Learning in Animals), meerkats (Thornton & McAuliffe, 2006,
Science), and chimpanzees (Biro et al., 2006, In: Cognitive Development in Chimpanzees). It remains plausible
that if groups of ASC had included otters aged 1-2 years old, a similarly strong social transmission effect
relative to the SC group may have been identified. This emphasizes further need to be cautious with species-
level comparisons, as species here is confounded with age. Again, the authors acknowledge this (lines 387-
390), but this element of the data greatly limits the extent to which inferences about species differences can
be drawn. Given the above limitations, I would like to see more emphasis on alternative explanations with the
intent to generate hypotheses for future studies.
These are fair points, and we agree that additional caution is helpful. We have therefore added an explicit
caveat to our interpretation of the species difference in the extent to which juveniles rely on social
information to the Results section (lines 323-326). We have also added two new paragraphs to the
Discussion: in the first (lines 342-347) we explicitly acknowledge the limitations of our inferences given our
limited sample size and limited understanding of these species in nature. In the second new paragraph (lines
360-371), we now describe the lack of information on how wild ASC otters acquire their extractive foraging
behaviours, mention the previous studies on other mammal species showing juveniles’ reliance on social
information to acquire extractive foraging behaviours (as kindly pointed out by the reviewer), further
emphasize the preliminary nature of the species difference we describe, and describe our plan to study
younger ASC offspring and more smooth-coated otter groups to either replicate or reject our preliminary
findings.
Regarding the analysis, I have two major comments. First, rather than make broad, qualitative statements
regarding differences in network structure between SC and ASC groups (lines 214-217; 258-261), it would
seem preferable to conduct randomizations tests to quantitatively assess whether observed network
structures differ from null expectations. Another possibility would be to include a measure of social
differentiation for each network as a quantitative estimate of how structured (or homogeneous) it is (see
Heathcote et al., 2017, Scientific Reports for a recent example of this measure being used).
We considered the reviewer’s suggestions carefully and decided to go with their second suggestion. Both
real underlying networks will almost certainly be non-random to some extent, even if in some cases (as we
argue for the ASC otters) these differences from randomness/homogeneity are small. Thus, having a
significant result in a hypothesis test against randomness merely shows that we have enough data to detect
the patterns that are there, not that deviations from randomness are large or meaningful. Our claim here is
that the smooth-coated otter network deviated from random/homogeneity more than the Asian short-
clawed otter networks, so we used the suggested social differentiation coefficient to quantify how
structured each network is (now mentioned in Methods lines 138-139), and report this in the Results (lines
221 and 264-265).
Second, I would like to see some justification for how task difficulties were ranked. For example, it’s not clear
to me why task 5 is presumed more difficult than task 4 for the SC group (Figure 1). Would it be possible to use
NBDA to provide a more objective means of assessing task difficulty? Presumably, more difficult tasks would
have lower baseline solving rates than less difficult tasks. In the description of the dTADA in the supplementary
material, the authors even state that task was included as an individual-level variable to account for variation
in task difficulty. Can the estimated baseline acquisition rates for each task be presented and compared?
Yes, these can indeed be estimated from the dTADA (but not the OADA), so we are able to provide these
estimates for the Asian short-clawed otter tasks (where we had Time of Acquisition data) but not for the
smooth-coated otter tasks (for which we only had Order of Acquisition data). The times of solving were not
measured accurately enough to allow us to get very precise estimates here but they are sufficient to show
that tasks 3 and 4 are the more difficult ones. This is now reported in the Methods lines 193-194 and Results
lines 268-270.
Beyond the larger points discussed above, I had a variety of minor comments and suggestions about elements
of the manuscript, which I address below.
Lines 19-20: “more complex prey” is a vague phrase. Perhaps change to something like “prey requiring more
extractive foraging behaviors”
We have changed this accordingly.
Lines 22-23: “and [may] adopt a ‘copy when young’ strategy”
We have changed this accordingly.
At the end of the first paragraph in the Introduction, it may be helpful to point out why social learning
strategies are an important focus of current social learning research (e.g., indiscriminate social learning may
often be not adaptive).
We have revised lines 35-37 accordingly.
Lines 39-42: This sentence reads very awkwardly, given the inclusion of two semi-colons. Please rewrite.
We have rewritten this sentence (lines 40-43).
Lines 48-52: Another example of ‘copy-older-individuals’ is nine-spined sticklebacks copying patch choices
(Duffy et al., 2009, Animal Behaviour).
We have added this reference (lines 52-53).
Lines 63-67: The Dugatkin & Godin (1993) reference cited earlier fits nicely as an example here as well.
We have added this example.
Lines 68-70: It may be helpful to clarify why species are expected to differ in the social learning strategies they
employ.
We have added the following (lines 72-75): “These determinants and resulting social learning strategies may
differ between species, depending on, for example, opportunities for social interaction, the extent to which
behaviour needs to be adjusted to changing spatial and/or temporal environments, and how risky or costly
it is to obtain personal information (24).”
Lines 91-93: Is there any information on how ASC otters develop their foraging techniques? As discussed
above, might it be plausible that extractive foraging techniques used on crabs and shellfish may be socially
transmitted from adults to young ASC otters?
Unfortunately we have not been able to locate any further information regarding the development of their
extractive foraging techniques. We are about to start a new study on parent-offspring interactions in the
ASC otters in captivity in the hopes of gaining a better understanding of their behavioural development. We
now describe these points in lines 360-371 of the Discussion.
Lines 94-103: I really like this paragraph! It provides a nice justification for this work and future studies in this
vein.
Thank you!
Lines 104-107: It seems doubtful to me that the lack of research on otter social learning is because keepers
couldn’t (or didn’t wish to) separate their animals for training and demonstration sessions. NBDA has been
fairly well-established at this point as a useful method for inferring social transmission in freely-interacting
groups, so perhaps it’s enough to simply state that the possibility of social learning in these groups was
investigated here via NBDA.
We have removed this paragraph.
Line 126: Clarify that N here means the number of individuals per group (and not the number of groups).
We have clarified this.
Lines 133-134: Is there justification for one body-length as the measure of association? Is social transmission
plausible over farther distances? Was a chain-rule employed?
The one body-length association measure is suggested in Croft et al (2008), as we now clarify in line 131. It is
not known whether social transmission in otters is plausible over father distances. We did not employ a
chain-rule.
Lines 137-140: The denominator for the simple ratio index should be the number of samples individuals were
observed apart plus the number of samples in which they were associating. Currently, only the former is
included in the manuscript.
We thank the reviewer for pointing out this mistake in the text – we have modified the text accordingly
(lines 137-138).
Lines 160-163: As mentioned earlier, could baseline rates in the NBDA be used to assess how difficult the tasks
actually were for the otters, rather than subjectively assigning ‘difficulty’? If not, could more justification be
provided for the difficulty rankings?
We assessed task difficulty from our personal experience opening the tasks (now described in line 160). We
have now also added NBDA baseline rates of solving for the ASC tasks as described above.
Lines 180-200: For readers unfamiliar with NBDA, it may be helpful to include a brief discussion of how NBDA
estimates the effect of social transmission.
We have added a brief description of NBDA to lines 179-185.
Lines 214-217: As mentioned earlier, carrying out a randomization test or including an estimate of social
differentiation would allow for a more quantitative assessment of whether “individuals differed greatly in how
much they associated with each other”.
We have now added social differentiation coefficients for each network, as described above.
Lines 221-223: Please clarify whether these weights are for the top social and asocial models or whether they
are summed across all of the multiplicative social transmission models and asocial models respectively?
Line 225 states: “for the best of the social transmission models”. There was only one asocial learning model
per species, as shown in Table 1.
Lines 226-227: How can 100% of the task solves occur through social transmission, given that the initial solves
occurred via asocial learning? Or do these estimates only include solving events that occurred after the first
solve within each diffusion? Please clarify.
Yes these estimates only include solving events that occurred after the first solve (i.e. “innovation”) within
each diffusion, as described in the header of Table 2: “% of events by social transmission (excluding
innovation)”, and the comment below Table 2: “Note that it is common for OADA to fail to put an upper limit
on the strength of social transmission when the order of learning follows the network closely. This simply
means it is plausible that all individuals learned by social transmission, except the innovator.” To further
clarify this we have added “(except for the first solver or ‘innovator’ in the group)” to lines 230-231.
Lines 258-261: Again, I think randomization tests/social differentiation estimates would be valuable here.
We have added social differentiation coefficients for each network, as described above.
Lines 294-295; 299: Again, please clarify whether the initial solvers were included in the estimated % of solves
that occurred via social transmission.
We now state that innovators were excluded from these estimates.
Lines 314-317: It is stated by the authors later on (lines 388-391), but the caveat that ‘young’ otters in the ASC
groups were quite a bit older than those in the SC group makes me question the validity of this comparison.
We agree, and have added: “A caveat here is that the offspring in the smooth-coated otter group were 1-2
years old, while the offspring in the Asian short-clawed otter groups were 4-10 years old. Whether younger
Asian short-clawed otter offspring would have outperformed their parents as observed in the smooth-coated
otters thus remains to be investigated.” (lines 323-326).
Line 331: ...smooth-coated otters [can?] learn from each other...
We have added “can”
Line 334: ‘unprecedented’ seems a tad strong. Perhaps ‘novel insights’ instead?
We have changed this accordingly.
Lines 341-346: As discussed earlier, it seems plausible that an argument could be made that complex
extractive foraging tasks might be predicted to promote reliance on social information, especially in juveniles.
We now address this point in a new section in the Discussion: please see lines 360-371.
Lines 364-365: In addition to a randomized task order, testing several groups of both species would be
necessary to truly provide good support for such a conclusion.
We agree and have now added “in several additional groups of both smooth-coated and Asian short-clawed
otters” (lines 389-390).
Lines 371-378: These results are consistent with ‘copy-when-young’, but provide only weak support for this
strategy. It would be better to compare social transmission rates per unit of network connection within and
between classes of individuals within a network (e.g., Farine et al., 2015, Current Biology). I would like to see
more discussion of alternative explanations for why young individuals had a higher solving rate. As mentioned,
younger individuals might be more motivated to contact the tasks, particularly given that the first solver was
always a young individual in the SC group. Is it plausible that younger individuals exhibited less neophobia than
older individuals or were more likely to engage in play behavior? Could older individuals have experienced
little positive reinforcement over their lifespan that promoted engagement with novel elements of their
enclosures?
The Discussion section of our manuscript is becoming prohibitively extensive. We have added these potential
explanatory factors in between brackets to lines 402-403, but prefer not to speculate further to avoid
extending the Discussion even more. We would be happy to elaborate if requested by the Editor.
Lines 390-392: Additional studies on both species—not just ASC otters—would be needed.
We have added “and additional smooth-coated otter groups” to line 417.
Lines 590-593: The text and image for figure 1, items 5 & 6, don’t match.
Apologies for this oversight – we have fixed this now.
