Toelch et al. investigated how social pressures influence the perceptual decisions of subjects.
They asked subjects to complete a moving dots task in several different contexts that manipulated
various social pressures on subjects’ decisions. The basic finding was that social pressures did
influenced subjects’ decisions. The authors report on two experiments each with a large sample
size (relative to experiments within the perceptual decision making literature) and provide all of
their materials. However, the writing and presentation of the results made it extremely difficult
to understand the subtleties of the design and to fully follow the results despite constant flipping
back and forth. Therefore, while this study is of potential interest, it requires a complete re-write
in order to allow the reader to understand what has actually been done and found.
Detailed comments
1. I was confused by the authors’ use of the word “normative”. Typically, in perceptual decision
making papers, “normative” means “optimal”. However, this is not how the authors seem to be
using the word. Instead, they appear to use it to refer to social influences such that “normative”
can be substituted with “social.” I don’t know if this is indeed the case and assume that there is
some additional subtlety intended by the word normative. It would be very helpful to define
precisely from the onset what exactly is the intended meaning of the terminology used.
2. Related to the above, the authors use “informational influence” seemingly to refer to the
perceptual information. However, outside of clear context, I often thought the informational
refers to the social influence. Again, clearer terminology would go a long way to improve the
readability of the document. Maybe the confusion comes from using terms from the social
psychology literature that I’m unfamiliar with. If this is the case, and these terms need to be used
even though they’d confuse the rest of us, then they should be repeatedly defined in each section.
3. Despite spending several minutes on it, I can’t understand what exactly is being plotted in
Figure 2 and how to interpret it. Presumably, panel B is based on panel A but I don’t know how.
Please, use a more intuitive way of displaying the results.
4. There was so little information about the drift diffusion analyses, that it is close to very difficult
to comment on them.
5. The title of the paper suggests that the results imply a specific mechanism that was discovered
(e.g., social decision influence our perceptual decisions “through modulation of a response bias”).
Response bias, however, is a general term that could encompass any modulation of one’s
decisions, thus making that second part completely redundant. If something more specific is
intended (that is not already implied by the main finding itself), then it should be stated clearly.
6. It was very difficult to follow the exact payoff structure for each condition based on what is
provided in Figure 1 and the Methods. I’d suggest including a table and streamlining the
explanations even more to help the reader. Some additional questions here: Did one subjects’
choices actually affect the payoff of other subjects? If 4 participants were present in a session, then
what were subjects told about why are only shown two responses at a time? Given that phase 2
was longer than phase 1, were subjects told that some of the same trials that other subjects saw
will appear to them multiple times during phase 2? Did you inform subjects that “pay-off
matrices were designed such that selecting the correct option (independent of norms) would
result in a maximisation of pay-off”?
7. Was the coherence adjustment done for each subject individually or for the group as a whole?
8. Please report the precise ANOVAs being run in the Results section. For many of them, it is not
clear what all of the factors are.
9. The following sentence from the abstract needs to be edited: “In a direction-of-motion
3
discrimination task where participants combined their individual information (i.e. perceptual)
with social information (i.e. other players’ choices).”
10. It may be helpful to provide subjects’ age and payment ranges.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
So this is a very nice manuscript. It presents some interesting results on how social information
(which was actually fake, but not known to the participants) is used in conjunction with noisy
sensory evidence. I think that this is a very interesting study which combines strands from
perceptual decision making as well as use of social information. The literature covered is wide
ranging and appropriate, although I think there is scope to acknowledge Morgan et al (2012) and
Koriat (2012). I certainly think the results presented in this manuscript would be of broad interest.
The manuscript is well written, but the compact nature of the paper means that sometimes it is
difficult for the reader to follow along with the logic and rationale of some aspects of the
experiment design.
MAJOR POINT 1
I strongly urge the authors to consider adding one other analysis. There is evidence to suggest
that there may well be differences in how the sexes are influenced by social information. In the
present paper we don’t have sex of the people providing the social cues (as these are simulated)
but we do have sex of the participant. So it would be possible, and very interesting, to see to what
extent men vs women behave differently with the social information. This additional analysis
would unlikely be sufficient for a paper it’s own right, but it could potentially add quite a bit to
the present paper, linking it with an existing strand of literature on sex differences in group
conformity. I point the authors to the nice paper by Cross et al (2017)
4
MAJOR POINT 2
This might sound subtle, but it is an important point. The outcome of a perceptual decision is
often assumed to be an actual percept. So in the context of this paper, it sounds as if the authors
are claiming that social information changes percepts of the world. However, I don’t think this is
what the authors are claiming. If instead that the claim is that the participant’s perceptual
decision is integrated with the social information to influence the participant’s _response_ (not
percept) then this needs to be made clearer in a few places. Eg title/abstract/start of discussion,
but there may be more places.
MAJOR POINT 3
I found it a bit difficult to extract some of what was done in the paper, particularly relating to the
experiment structure and conditions. Some of this might be the frustrating format of the
publisher with text, figures, and figure legends in 3 different places. However there is actually
quite a lot going on in this experiment, and I think the compactness of the paper makes it a bit
tricky to follow along.
I think the clarity of the manuscript would be much increased by providing a but more
contextual information about the task design (eg main paragraph starting on page 4). There is a
lot of information here which is introduced, and it is not really clear why a complex reward
structure to self vs other was used. I think this needs to be expanded somewhat so that the reader
can follow along the logic of why these things were done. Could perhaps consider a clear
enumerated list of precise questions in order to better understand the motivation for the various
aspects of the experimental tasks (particularly the payoff structures).
Along these lines there is possible confusing wording. At the start of the discussion we have
“normative and informational influences” which I find a bit vague then in the next sentence
“perceptual with social information” which I find unambiguous and clear. So it might be best to
do away with the normative and informational terminology?
Edit. Normative is often used to describe “normative rationality” but it took me a while to realise
we are talking about social norms. So maybe disambiguate by always saying “social norms”.
I found Figure 1, bottom very difficult to understand
MINOR POINTS
Models: I found the description of the 6 model variants went by pretty quickly and could do with
a bit more overview or detail to help the reader digest this.
Model fitting: Need to include a small bit of information about the MCMC fitting. How many
chains, how many samples, what was done to confirm the MCMC chains converged? Without the
latter information in particular, we do not have certainty that the generated MCMC samples (thus
estimated parameters) are reflective of the true posterior distribution.
Equation 1
At the moment the information around Equation 1 is insufficient to be useful. So we should either
remove all this to the Supplementary Material, or do a small bit of clarification.
- shouldn’t be a gap between “W” and “AIC”
- I think we have a missing “i=1” under the Sum symbol
- the “R” defined above Equation 1 needs to be an italic math variable. Same for \theta_i
- I don’t see a definition for “w”
- We need some clarification of what the two slightly different theta symbols are.

The terminology is now tightened, which improves the clarity and readability of the manuscript.
The updated title is clearer, however it still refers to “norm” which was removed in the
terminology update. So perhaps “Norm compliance” needs to be changed to “Social norm
compliance” in the title? Although I realise this is different from the change in the "normative"
terminology. Happy either way.
I appreciate the author’s consideration of my Major point 1 to explore whether there were any sex
differences in social norm compliance, even though it was not central to the aims of the
manuscript. This supplementary analysis and consideration is entirely satisfactory.
I am also entirely happy with the clarification (Major point 2, re perceptual vs decision effects)
that the author’s have provided. The changes made in the text again make the manuscript much
clearer.
I’m happy that my minor concerns were also addressed satisfactorily. I was also happy to see the
addition of more details in the Supplementary Materials.
I re-read the entire paper and think that it is much improved. The authors have responded well to
the initial concerns of myself and the other reviewer, and the current manuscript is much clearer.
I think this is interesting work that looks at an interesting issue with a nice experimental
paradigm. The work is done with rigour and deserves to be put out there.

paradigm. The work is done with rigour and deserves to be put out there.

Appendix A
Reply to reviewers:
We thank both reviewers for their helpful and constructive comments. Both reviewers made
critical remarks regarding the terminology as well as the presentation of methods and results.
n response to those comments, we restructured and rewrote several parts of the manuscript
and give a detailed account on how we dealt with each point below. We also extended the
supplements to give a more in detail description of our modelling results. Reviewers’ original
comments are given in italics.

Detailed comments
1. I was confused by the authors’ use of the word “normative”. Typically, in perceptual
decision making papers, “normative” means “optimal”. However, this is not how the authors
seem to be using the word. Instead, they appear to use it to refer to social influences such that
“normative” can be substituted with “social.” I don’t know if this is indeed the case and
assume that there is some additional subtlety intended by the word normative. It would be
very helpful to define precisely from the onset what exactly is the intended meaning of the
erminology used.
2. Related to the above, the authors use “informational influence” seemingly to refer to the
perceptual information. However, outside of clear context, I often thought the informational
refers to the social influence. Again, clearer terminology would go a long way to improve the
readability of the document. Maybe the confusion comes from using terms from the social
psychology literature that I’m unfamiliar with. If this is the case, and these terms need to be
used even though they’d confuse the rest of us, then they should be repeatedly defined in each
section.
Ad 1,2) Both reviewers were critical on our terminology how to phrase the different types of
nformation and the norms. Indeed, we derived our terminology from a classic social
psychology paper (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955). We agree, however, that this may cause some
confusion with readers not familiar with this social psychology terminology (which is even
not consistently used in the social psychology literature see for example the distinction of
descriptive and injunctive norms (Cialdini & Goldstein, 2004)). We thus changed our
erminology throughout the paper. We now use the terms perceptual information for the
andom dots, social information for the arrows on top, and in line with the suggestion of
eviewer 1 and 2, now use the term social norm and omit the word normative.
3. Despite spending several minutes on it, I can’t understand what exactly is being plotted
n Figure 2 and how to interpret it. Presumably, panel B is based on panel A but I don’t know
how. Please, use a more intuitive way of displaying the results.
Both panels are two measures of players’ behavior during the game that do not necessarily
ollow from each other. Whereas panel A describes the change in correct choices, panel B
gives how often participants follow social information (conform to the majority). We tried to
clarify this in the Figure caption and in the results section. We did not change the Figure itself
as we think the added information should be sufficient to understand this difference.
4. There was so little information about the drift diffusion analyses, that it is close to very
difficult to comment on them.
We now added additional information on the drift diffusion models (Figure S3), the models
hat we compare (Table S6) and also added tables with the full linear mixed models to the
supplements (Table S4, S5).
5. The title of the paper suggests that the results imply a specific mechanism that was
discovered (e.g., social decision influence our perceptual decisions “through modulation of a
response bias”). Response bias, however, is a general term that could encompass any
modulation of one’s decisions, thus making that second part completely redundant. If
something more specific is intended (that is not already implied by the main finding itself),
hen it should be stated clearly.
We now specifically address our main finding, the modulation of the starting point bias in the
itle. The change of the drift rate was specific to a particular condition. The initial idea was to
summarize both findings as a response bias. We agree however with reviewer 1 and changed
he title accordingly to the more specific finding.
6. It was very difficult to follow the exact payoff structure for each condition based on
what is provided in Figure 1 and the Methods. I’d suggest including a table and streamlining
he explanations even more to help the reader.
We added the table and omitted the bottom panel in Figure 1. We also added information on
he exact methods in several places:
Did one subjects’ choices actually affect the payoff of other subjects?
We give this information in the abstract (ll.26-28)
“In addition, we created conflict scenarios where players’ choices affected other participants’
monetary rewards dependent on whether their choices were in line or against the opinion of
he other players.”
Additionally, in the introduction (ll. 87,88)
“To ensure that norm compliance had consequences on a social level, norm compliance
affected the remuneration of the other players.“
And in the methods section (e.g. Table 1).
f 4 participants were present in a session, then what were subjects told about why are only
shown two responses at a time?
We clarify this now in the Methods (ll. 161,162)
“In case four participants were present, we told them explicitly which two players’ decisions
hey would see.”
Given that phase 2 was longer than phase 1, were subjects told that some of the same trials
hat other subjects saw will appear to them multiple times during phase 2?
This information is now given in the Methods (ll. 159-161)
“We informed participants that we had collected their decisions during phase one and that
andomly drawn decisions (with replacement) of two other participants would be displayed as
arrows on top of the RDK.”
Did you inform subjects that “pay-off matrices were designed such that selecting the correct
option (independent of norms) would result in a maximisation of pay-off”?
No we did not reveal the pay off structure to participants as is common in social psychology
experiments. We informed players in instructions that the only way to gather points would be
o give the correct answer though. We clarify this now in ll. 190-192).
“The pay-off matrix was not revealed to players prior to the experiment. Instructions made it
clear, however, that the only way to score points was to select the correct option.”
7. Was the coherence adjustment done for each subject individually or for the group as a
whole?
This was done individually, now clarified at ll. 147-149.
“In this first phase, difficulty was systematically varied by changing the dot coherence level to
estimate at which level participants had approximately 70% correct choices. This was done
or each participant individually.”
8. Please report the precise ANOVAs being run in the Results section. For many of them, it
s not clear what all of the factors are.
We rewrote this section slightly and added more details on the linear mixed models and
associated F-tests. We also provide full models in the supplements as tables (Table S1-S5).
9. The following sentence from the abstract needs to be edited: “In a direction-of-motion
discrimination task where participants combined their individual information (i.e. perceptual)
with social information (i.e. other players’ choices).”
We rewrote the abstract to accommodate the new terminology (see points 1,2) and also fixed
his incomplete sentence.
“In a direction-of-motion discrimination task, participants received perceptual information
alongside information on other players’ choices.”
10. It may be helpful to provide subjects’ age and payment ranges.
We now provide this information at p.4 ll. 111-116

MAJOR POINT 1
strongly urge the authors to consider adding one other analysis. There is evidence to
suggest that there may well be differences in how the sexes are influenced by social
nformation. In the present paper we don’t have sex of the people providing the social cues
as these are simulated) but we do have sex of the participant. So it would be possible, and
very interesting, to see to what extent men vs women behave differently with the social
nformation. This additional analysis would unlikely be sufficient for a paper it’s own right,
but it could potentially add quite a bit to the present paper, linking it with an existing strand
of literature on sex differences in group conformity. I point the authors to the nice paper by
Cross et al (2017)
We added an exploratory analysis in the supplements. The results do not show a consistent
pattern of sex differences for perceptual decisions in percentage correct choices and
particularly not in following social information. Our study was not explicitly designed to test
or gender differences and lacks the statistical power of the Cross study with less participants
per group (our study: ~35 per group, Cross study: ~80 per group). This could be one reason
or the lack of an effect. However, one take home message from our study is that conformity
changes the amount of evidence that is needed to elicit a response. Whether confidence is a
direct read out of this decision variable is still up to debate (Fleming & Daw, 2017; Kvam &
Pleskac, 2016; Sanders, Hangya, & Kepecs, 2016). One possibility is that decision thresholds
are different between tasks for men and women and that confidence could be a readout of the
difference between accumulated evidence and initial decision threshold. The decision to
change one’s mind could then be determined after the decision where the full process of
eaching this decision is no longer represented, but only derived variables (e.g. time to reach
decision). Alternatively, the process of post decision evidence computation could be different
between sexes (see e.g. (Berg et al., 2016)). These are certainly important questions when the
goal is to answer how metacognition is linked to decisions. Because the focus of the present
manuscript is on social norms rather than confidence, we consider this aspect beyond the
scope of this manuscript.
MAJOR POINT 2
This might sound subtle, but it is an important point. The outcome of a perceptual decision is
often assumed to be an actual percept. So in the context of this paper, it sounds as if the
authors are claiming that social information changes percepts of the world. However, I don’t
hink this is what the authors are claiming. If instead that the claim is that the participant’s
perceptual decision is integrated with the social information to influence the participant’s
_response_ (not percept) then this needs to be made clearer in a few places. Eg
itle/abstract/start of discussion, but there may be more places.
As outlined above we do not think that the percept is changed but rather the amount of
evidence needed to elicit a decision. That is, the amount of perceptual information that is
acquired during sampling of the random dots is changed based on the current context. This is
n line with previous findings that prior information will change a starting point bias
Forstmann, Brown, Dutilh, Neumann, & Wagenmakers, 2010; Mulder, Wagenmakers,
Ratcliff, Boekel, & Forstmann, 2012). We went over the manuscript to clarify this at several
occasions (e.g. ll. 108-111, ll. 346-348, ll. 371-373).
MAJOR POINT 3
found it a bit difficult to extract some of what was done in the paper, particularly relating to
he experiment structure and conditions. Some of this might be the frustrating format of the
publisher with text, figures, and figure legends in 3 different places. However there is actually
quite a lot going on in this experiment, and I think the compactness of the paper makes it a bit
ricky to follow along.
think the clarity of the manuscript would be much increased by providing a but more
contextual information about the task design (eg main paragraph starting on page 4). There
s a lot of information here which is introduced, and it is not really clear why a complex
reward structure to self vs other was used. I think this needs to be expanded somewhat so that
he reader can follow along the logic of why these things were done. Could perhaps consider
a clear enumerated list of precise questions in order to better understand the motivation for
he various aspects of the experimental tasks (particularly the payoff structures).
Along these lines there is possible confusing wording. At the start of the discussion we have
“normative and informational influences” which I find a bit vague then in the next sentence
“perceptual with social information” which I find unambiguous and clear. So it might be best
o do away with the normative and informational terminology?
Edit. Normative is often used to describe “normative rationality” but it took me a while to
realise we are talking about social norms. So maybe disambiguate by always saying “social
norms”.
We added more information on the pay-off structure (Table 1) and experimental detail in the
methods section. We also changed the terminology in the paper to follow suggestions by
eviewer 1 and 2.
Reply to reviewer 1:

found Figure 1, bottom very difficult to understand
We removed this and added a table (Table 1) with a full representation of the pay-off matrix.
MINOR POINTS
Models: I found the description of the 6 model variants went by pretty quickly and could do
with a bit more overview or detail to help the reader digest this.
We added more detail particularly in the supplements to make it clearer for readers that need a
more in depth understanding of the DDMs and the modelling process. This is particularly
captured in the newly introduced Figure S3 (depicting the Drift Diffusion Process with the
wo parameters of interest) and Table S6 (including the models and how they differ in their
exact parametrization).
Model fitting: Need to include a small bit of information about the MCMC fitting. How many
chains, how many samples, what was done to confirm the MCMC chains converged? Without
he latter information in particular, we do not have certainty that the generated MCMC
samples (thus estimated parameters) are reflective of the true posterior distribution.
This was already done in the previous manuscript in the supplements. We now refer directly
o the supplements that give full details on priors and MCMC sampling as well as chain
convergence.
Equation 1
At the moment the information around Equation 1 is insufficient to be useful. So we should
either remove all this to the Supplementary Material, or do a small bit of clarification.
shouldn’t be a gap between “W” and “AIC”
I think we have a missing “i=1” under the Sum symbol
the “R” defined above Equation 1 needs to be an italic math variable. Same for \theta_i
I don’t see a definition for “w”
We need some clarification of what the two slightly different theta symbols are.
We corrected Equation 1 but nonetheless moved the whole paragraph on model averaging to
he supplements as suggested by reviewer 2.
p. 9. “Malus points”?
Meant as the opposite of bonus points but now changed to negative points.
