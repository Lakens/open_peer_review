This study uses an impressive dataset to address interesting questions. Unfortunately the
methods are not very clear nor are the chosen methods of analysis well-justified. The introduction
is poorly referenced, and despite its substantial length, a couple of key concepts are not brought
up until the predictions part at the end of the intro or even not until the discussion (see comments
below). I have a number of specific comments:
L 16-17. “I demonstrate that a parent’s impact on offspring’s fitness most likely results from
parental investment rather than genetic contribution. “ The naïve assumption would be that it
would be a mix of the two, with parents being more important than genetics for traits like fitness,
so this is not surprising.
L52-63. This whole section is confusingly written:
L52-57. You contrast predictive with volatile environments, but state that they can result in the
same prediction, ie quantity over quality. High mortality is also mentioned in two places,
seemingly contrasting adult and child mortality, but again stating that they result in the same
prediction. The argument could be clarified by instead stressing how (and why) these diverse
environmental variables all can lead to the same predictions regarding qq/trade-offs.
L55-59
L 57. Grammar: You cannot have an ‘on the other hand’ without first having an ‘on the one hand’.
Also, ‘low mortality’ presumably means ‘low child mortality’, ie this and the preceding sentence
are contrasting low and high child mortality and stating opposite predictions? If so, this could be
written more clearly.
L71. ‘Ones;’, I guess you mean ‘individual’.
L73. Unclear what ‘primed by’ means, primed how? In a controlled experiment?
L77. May want to cite ‘Nettle, Phil Trans, 2011. Flexibility in reproductive timing in human
females: integrating ultimate and proximate explanations’
L82. These 4 references are all on the !Kung, there are plenty of studies on other societies, see e.g.
Walker et al. Am J Hum Biol. 2006. ‘Growth Rates and Life Histories in Twenty-Two Small-Scale
Societies’
L595-625. References are numbered 39 to 43 two times!
L92-94. Need a citation here, who are ‘some researchers’?
L107-108. ‘Have led some to argue’, Kaplan is cited at the endof this argument, are there no other
proponents of this view?
L127-140. The questions and predictions section is the very first mention of genetic vs
environmental contributions to variation in LRS. Would be nice with some theoretical
background and justification for prediction 3, especially since this is an important part of the
results.
3
L174 make sure that tables and figures are labelled according to the order in which they appear in
the text. For example, I think that table 1 has not yet been mentioned, so table 2 should be table 1
etc.
L198. In addition, dominance and maternal effects will inflate h2 estimates to different extents for
full-sib and parent-offspring regressions.
L208. I can’t find this footnote.
L220-224 and table 1. The table captions informs me that this is obtained from Pearson
correlations and that “Full sibling and parent offspring correlation analyses were carried out with
equal weight to nuclear families.” Please clarify what the latter statement means. How was
pseudoreplication controlled for in the models? A partial correlation was used to control for
interbirth intervals, perhaps a regression approach would be preferable because it would allow to
control for multiple random effects such as individual identity of parents.
L233-240. Does lifespan include infant and child mortality? If so, is the relationship between
number of siblings and lifespan driven by high numbers of infant deaths in families with many
children? If so, there may in fact be no difference in adult lifespan between individuals from
small and big families. The same effect would apply to LRS, if it includes values of 0 for
individuals that died before reproductive age.
L282-288. This sections mentions the use of first cousins, implying that the data is organised in
such a way that it would be possible to extract full pedigree data and use an animal model that
could make use of all levels of relatedness, rather than focussing on full-sibling and parent-
offspring regressions. This would help to some extent with the problem of shared environments,
because a full pedigree contains several levels of relatives that do not share a common household.
An animal model is already implemented for the SNP data, so it should be straightforward to use
one on the full dataset as well. The animal model would also allow to control for variation due to
geographic area (which is currently investigated by comparing full-sib to first cousin regressions)
and any other pertinent effects that have been measured.
L312-313. I had to read this sentence several times to understand what you wanted to say.
L317. I assume you mean to say which environmental factors that bias the heritability estimates
upwards, and how these factors differs between parent-offspring and full-sibling estimates. The
use of heritability estimates to mean parental investment becomes quite confusing in the
discussion, eg L 394-395 and other places).
L317-320. Full-sib regressions are theoretically expected to be higher than parent-offspring
regressions due to dominance, common environment and maternal effects, so this is not a
surprising result.
L322-326. I don’t understand this argument. If children are expensive to produce, and the costs of
siblings are higher, surely this leads to a high, not low (L324), qq-trade-off (each offspring is very
costly, so you have few costly offspring rather than many cheap offspring)?
L335. Is there a statistical test of this that I missed? Looking at figure 1, it does not appear very
convincing to me that fertility trends precede longevity changes. They’re negatively correlated,
but that does not mean that one is driving the other. Given that this result is discussed at length,
there should be some stats to support it.
4
L341-343. This could be tested in your data, given you have data on both fertility rates and
lifespans.
L380-397. This paragraph is the background, methods and results of a previously completely
unmentioned question. The discussion of this results starts only on L397.

Summary
This paper makes use of an unusual dataset from Iceland to test predictions from life-history
theory, and as such, is interesting to evolutionary anthropologists and biologists. In particular,
the dataset contains genetic data that enable the author to conduct advanced statistical analyses
to tease apart genetic and environmental effects. It is rich, to say the least, and the author has
done considerable work. As a consequence, however, the paper is dense and hard to follow in
some places. It is very long and is testing (too) many hypotheses. I am also not really convinced
by some of the interpretations, which is likely due to the fact that there are so many analyses and
abstractions (e.g. transformations) that one is left uncertain about the empirical validity of the
conclusions. To simplify/clarify the paper, it may be helpful to organize the result section by
research questions/predictions (those made by the end of the introduction). It may also help to
narrow down the number of research questions/findings.
General comments
1. About the findings
There are interesting findings, for instance that decline in fertility precedes decline in mortality,
and that “harsh conditions may trigger an increase in reproductive effort and a decrease in PI per
offspring”. There are also counter-intuitive findings, i.e. “individuals reduce their reproductive
5
effort when offspring are cheap to produce”. Here, however, I fail to understand how this
validates life-history theory, as argued elsewhere in the paper. This needs to be clarified.
2. About the evidence of a quantity/quality tradeoff
Each additional sibling reduces an individual’s LRS by 0.07 children. Given family size tends to
be <5, I would argue that the effect (max = 5*0.07= 0.35 child) is negligible and that individuals
do not face a substantial trade-off. It would help to comment on the size of effects.
3. Little is known about the Icelandic Ecology
What is the marriage system, socially imposed monogamy? Do men remarry more than women?
The whole paper does not consider sex differences in the cost of reproduction but if remarriage is
more frequent for men than for women, for instance if women die in child birth leaving men free
to reproduce with other women, than the cost of reproduction is likely lower for men. Also, what
was the main mode of subsistence? It would be helpful to comment on the level of resource
inequality given the dataset does not contain data on social status and resources.
4. About the inference on the amount of parental investment given the heritability of LHT
If a LHT shows a low heritability, then it is assumed that there has been little parental
investment. This is because parental contribution makes little difference to the LHT. Yet this
could be better phrased, as it is not known whether or not there has been a lot, or little, parental
investment. What is known is that whatever the level of PI, it had little effect on LHT. This is
important for improving the clarity of the two following points:
a) when siblings reproduce alike, parental investment is assumed to be high. But consider this: if
siblings don’t have children, they reproduce similarly, however it can hardly be said that it
results from high parental investment. Statement about amount of parental investment
(low/high) should be rephrased in terms of contribution of parental investment to offspring
fitness (low/high).
b) L324: “the costs of siblings are higher and the quantity-quality trade-off is low”. That sounds
contradictory. I am not sure I follow the reasoning behind the idea that if parent-offspring
correlations are low, thus heritability is low, the quantity-quality trade-off is high. I would have
expected the quantity/quality trade-off to be low too, as PI has little effect on offspring fitness.
5. About the idea that shared environment inform on shared resources.
L 301: “the findings support the hypothesis that resources …have had important influences”. But
the dataset does not contain data on social status. In addition, shared family factors may
encompass more than resources, those could be fertility preferences. Shared environment shapes
several dimensions, socio-economic but also cultural.
Specific comments
L 32: the Refs on trade-offs should concern humans (rather than non-human animals only) or it
should be said which species they refer to.
L45-46: requires an explanation, as the length of the IBI is the trade-off itself.
L52: typo “mortality”
L54: why “In contrast”?
L56: the Ref concerns birds and mammals; thus one should talk about offspring rather than
children.
6
L61: Why “however”?
The paragraph starting line 64 is confusing. What matters is variation in socio-economic status
within high/low extrinsic mortality rates.
L71: “mechanisms behind the interaction between ones” should be rephrased
L79: mortality; extrinsic? Should be consistent throughout
P14 “Also” is repeated at length and the paragraph reads like a list. To improve the clarity of the
paper, it would help that each paper makes (and demonstrates) one specific point only.
L83: why “however”
L87: “Also” again
L94: Would account FOR
L106-111: you could cite Alvergne, A. & Lummaa, V. Ecological variation in wealth–fertility
relationships in Mongolia: the “central theoretical problem of sociobiology” not a problem after
all? Proc. R. Soc. London B Biol. Sci. 281, (2014).
The introduction is too long: it is not clear enough what is not known and what the paper will
address.
L149: typo “frequency”; L151 “Icelandic”, 153 “census”
L174-177: not clear why this transformation was applied. More explanation?
L180: heritability does not only concern genetic traits (or one would talk of heredity) but also
cultural traits.
L203: Reproductive effort as a population parameter; I find this confusing, reproductive effort
usually refers to individual parameters.
L231: why controlling for birth interval (trade-offs) between siblings when looking for trade-offs?
L265: typo “mortality”

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
I find this paper interesting but fear it is over-interpreting the results. The author looks in detail
at the relationship between fertility and mortality in Iceland over two centuries. If I understand it
correctly, two periods of exceptionally high mortality (one from disease and one from a volcano)
seem to be associated with density indendent mortality (when parent offspring correlations with
fertility or lifespan collapse ie mortality could be almost random). at other times next generaiton
fertility is related to parents family size, although as Iceland enters the demographic transition
the relatioship also weakens, presumably because variance in reproductive success goes down.
Heritability is due to inheritance of the family environment (family farm?) rather than genes or
other maternal effects. HOwever the presentation of the graphs does not make this that easy to
follow (so I may have got some of that a bit wrong).
I am aware that this paper has already been reviewed by others, and hate to contradict them, but
I think the interpretation of all these trends in terms of parental investment is over-extending the
results to things that have not necessarily been found. I think we already know that there is
usually some kind of quantity quality tradeoff in human reproduction. A number of papers
show that small sibships tend to have better outcomes. However this is being used
synonymously with PI, which I dont think it is - it might just be reduced competition for parental
resources, which is less specific.
Some points to make clearer are
13
- there are parent offspring correlations in fertiltiy but the graphs make it appear that at some
points in history that parent/offspring correlations disappear during crises?
- In order to make some of these results clearers, the figures should include on that shows all the
trends over time, but then others that show the relevant correlations (rather than just reporting
them on top of the figures - which in any case is not a good way to report them).
Overall I dont think this paper says much about parental investment. The ecological effects of
disaster, recovery and demogarphic transition are interesting however, so much of the analysis is
interesting and publishable. But I think they need to be discussed without equating every
change to active changes in parental investment. Ecological trends influence competition
between siblings, and the food supply, which could cause most of these effects wtihout parents
greatly changing their behaviour. I would prefer a simpler presentation, more graphs of the
relevant correlations, and less elaborate interpretation. The paper needs to be shortened,
especially the discussion and i think more focused on the facts, not extrapolations. Much of what
is described as PI I would simply describe more broadly as changes in competition for resources.

This is a resubmission of a paper that has already been through one round of peer review, and it
is clear that the author has made every effort to deal with the reviewers' comments. I think, in the
main, it is editor's job to decide if the comments have been addressed adequately, and not mine,
so I won't comment specifically on this.
My own views of the paper are that it represents a very interesting data set, of unprecedented
detail for a modern human population. The questions asked are interesting, and found the
analysis and interpretation thought-provoking. I have tried to keep my comments here to a
minimum as I know how annoying it is to suddenly have a whole new set of comments to deal
with, that differ from the first.

I did have some comments regarding the way the hypotheses are set up, and some queries about
the data analyses, however. These are detailed below:
L126-27 "Because each successive sibling is expected to reduce the total amount of PI available
there will be an overall fitness cost of siblings."
I think I understand what is meant here, but the wording is slightly ambiguous. Presumably you
mean that siblings will reduce each other's fitness? Presumably if parents are optimising costs
and benefits they should produce the number of offspring that will maximise their fitness, i.e., the
number that will ensure their offspring maximise their fitness too, or not? I'm not sure how
sibling and parental fitness come together here.
L131-132 "Because individuals are expected to accelerate life histories when the risk of mortality
132 is higher, lifespan and fertility rates will be negatively correlated."
I have a concern about reverse causality and "endogenity" with this prediction. Producing more
offspring more quickly may well shorten the lifespan, i.e., high fertility may itself represent an
increased mortality risk. So presumably this prediction is made with respect to variation in some
kind of external mortality risk? If so, what is it? Also LHT predictions with respect to mortality
risk depend on where mortality exerts its effects, i.e, on infant/juvenile mortality or on adults. So
perhaps this prediction needs to be specified with a little more precision?
L133-136 "Because both reproduction and investment in offspring are costs that parents are
expected to balance, fertility rates will be negatively correlated with parental investment while
mortality rates will be positively correlated with parental investment."
Again, whose mortality rates? Offspring or adult mortality rates? And are these extrinsic or
intrinsic mortality?
L155.The concept of natural fertility is that it represents fertility where there is no parity-specific
control of births, i.e, no stopping or spacing patterns after a certain number. Is this actually the
case for Iceland? Their fertility is entirely controlled by physiological means? What about age of
marriage does this vary in a way that suggests some form of fertility control. Is there any
evidence that people were stopping after a certain number of children? If you simply mean in the
absence of modern contraception, perhaps it could be reworded. Again, perhaps a bit more
precision would be good here.
L267-269 "(Question3/ prediction 3): Unsurprisingly, an individual’s lifespan was a positive and
significant predictor of his/her reproduction (r= 0.449, N= 138,213, p<0.001). Across the
population, however, mean lifespan was a significant and negative predictor of mean
reproduction (r= -0.45, p=0.013) (see Figure 1)."
Isn't this simply an example of the ecological fallacy, or rather Simpson's paradox? You find one
relationship at the individual level, and the opposite at the population level, where you used
aggregate data. This can come about simply because of differences in the variance at these two
levels of analysis. You then go onto use the results at the aggregate level to make inferences about
individuals, which is make be inaccurate as a consequence.
More generally with respect to the analyses, I was surprised that you didn't make more use of
multilevel modelling techniques. Some analyses are based on simple correlations (which often
involve aggregate data, which represents a loss of information). Is this because the dataset was
15
simply too big to run more complex models ? You suggest with respect to some of the analyses,
so is that true here for some reason?

Comments to the Author(s)
I find this paper interesting but fear it is over-interpreting the results. The author looks in detail
at the relationship between fertility and mortality in Iceland over two centuries. If I understand it
correctly, two periods of exceptionally high mortality (one from disease and one from a volcano)
seem to be associated with density indendent mortality (when parent offspring correlations with
fertility or lifespan collapse ie mortality could be almost random). at other times next generaiton
fertility is related to parents family size, although as Iceland enters the demographic transition
the relatioship also weakens, presumably because variance in reproductive success goes down.
Heritability is due to inheritance of the family environment (family farm?) rather than genes or
other maternal effects. HOwever the presentation of the graphs does not make this that easy to
follow (so I may have got some of that a bit wrong).
I am aware that this paper has already been reviewed by others, and hate to contradict them, but
I think the interpretation of all these trends in terms of parental investment is over-extending the
results to things that have not necessarily been found. I think we already know that there is
usually some kind of quantity quality tradeoff in human reproduction. A number of papers
show that small sibships tend to have better outcomes. However this is being used
synonymously with PI, which I dont think it is - it might just be reduced competition for parental
resources, which is less specific.
Some points to make clearer are
- there are parent offspring correlations in fertiltiy but the graphs make it appear that at some
points in history that parent/offspring correlations disappear during crises?
- In order to make some of these results clearers, the figures should include on that shows all the
trends over time, but then others that show the relevant correlations (rather than just reporting
them on top of the figures - which in any case is not a good way to report them).
Overall I dont think this paper says much about parental investment. The ecological effects of
disaster, recovery and demogarphic transition are interesting however, so much of the analysis is
interesting and publishable. But I think they need to be discussed without equating every
change to active changes in parental investment. Ecological trends influence competition
between siblings, and the food supply, which could cause most of these effects wtihout parents
greatly changing their behaviour. I would prefer a simpler presentation, more graphs of the
relevant correlations, and less elaborate interpretation. The paper needs to be shortened,
especially the discussion and i think more focused on the facts, not extrapolations. Much of what
is described as PI I would simply describe more broadly as changes in competition for resources.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a resubmission of a paper that has already been through one round of peer review, and it
is clear that the author has made every effort to deal with the reviewers' comments. I think, in the
main, it is editor's job to decide if the comments have been addressed adequately, and not mine,
so I won't comment specifically on this.
My own views of the paper are that it represents a very interesting data set, of unprecedented
detail for a modern human population. The questions asked are interesting, and found the
analysis and interpretation thought-provoking. I have tried to keep my comments here to a

mments to the Author(s)
s study uses an impressive dataset to address interesting questions. Unfortunately the
hods are not very clear nor are the chosen methods of analysis well-justified. The
oduction is poorly referenced, and despite its substantial length, a couple of key concepts are
brought up until the predictions part at the end of the intro or even not until the discussion
e comments below). I have a number of specific comments:
6-17. “I demonstrate that a parent’s impact on offspring’s fitness most likely results from
ental investment rather than genetic contribution“ The naïve assumption would be that it
uld be a mix of the two, with parents being more important than genetics for traits like fitness,
his is not surprising.
ree, but this still needs to be quantitatively and scientifically supported. This is especially
because heritability estimates for most traits, especially those less tied to fitness, tend to
ume the opposite (e.g. that parents have no environmental influence on offspring). I have
nged this sentence to “I demonstrate that the primary impact of parents on the fitness of their
dren is the result of resources and or investment but not genes” (lines 16-17) in order to
phasize that the key results are in the next two sentences (lines 17-20).
pe here]
-63. This whole section is confusingly written:
ve clarified and simplified this paragraph and the next one (lines 46-66).
-57. You contrast predictive with volatile environments, but state that they can result in the
e prediction, ie quantity over quality. High mortality is also mentioned in two places,
mingly contrasting adult and child mortality, but again stating that they result in the same
diction. The argument could be clarified by instead stressing how (and why) these diverse
ironmental variables all can lead to the same predictions regarding qq/trade-offs.
purpose of this paragraph was to introduce the idea that environment predictability and
rtality rates (both adult and child) can interact to generate complex, and sometimes surprising
eoffs. The distinction between child and adult mortality has been clarified (lines 55-58). I
e also taken this reviewer’s suggestion and added two sentences to “stress how (and why)
se diverse environmental variables can lead to the same predictions” to organize my argument
es 61-66).
-59
7. Grammar: You cannot have an ‘on the other hand’ without first having an ‘on the one
d’. Also, ‘low mortality’ presumably means ‘low child mortality’, ie this and the preceding
tence are contrasting low and high child mortality and stating opposite predictions? If so,
could be written more clearly.
n the other hand” has been eliminated. “Low mortality” refers to both adult and child
rtality rates so I have clarified this (lines 60-61). I also restructured the paragraph to better
lain this idea (lines 55-66).
. ‘Ones;’, I guess you mean ‘individual’.
s error (lines 63-66) was deleted when I revised the paragraph.
. Unclear what ‘primed by’ means, primed how? In a controlled experiment?
details of this experiment has been truncated and is now just alluded to in a sentence (line
“experimental support”).
pe here]
. May want to cite ‘Nettle, Phil Trans, 2011. Flexibility in reproductive timing in human
ales: integrating ultimate and proximate explanations’
s reference has been added (Lines 72-73).
. These 4 references are all on the !Kung, there are plenty of studies on other societies, see
Walker et al. Am J Hum Biol. 2006. ‘Growth Rates and Life Histories in Twenty-Two Small-
le Societies’
function of my references to the !Kung papers are to demonstrate how cultural changes (e.g.
er backload constraints) can alter birth spacing and, in turn, change optimal reproductive –
estment tradeoffs. But I take the point that this is not clear from the preceding sentence so I
e edited the text (lines 85-86) and the paragraph (lines 74-86) to make this point more clearly.
ve also added the Walker et. al. reference because, as the reviewer suggests, this point could
be emphasized through cross-cultural comparisons (line 86).
5-625. References are numbered 39 to 43 two times!
numbering has been fixed (lines 90-97).
-94. Need a citation here, who are ‘some researchers’?
ve now added Hobcraft et. al. 1986 and Palloni et. al. 1986 as citations for this ‘replacement’
othesis (lines 78-80).
7-108. ‘Have led some to argue’, Kaplan is cited at the end of this argument, are there no
er proponents of this view?
, and I have moved this section to the discussion section and have added four additional
rences (lines 405-407).
7-140. The questions and predictions section is the very first mention of genetic vs
ironmental contributions to variation in LRS. Would be nice with some theoretical
kground and justification for prediction 3, especially since this is an important part of the
ults.
ve edited the introduction in a few places to better organize and introduce the idea that both
es and environments can affect q-q tradeoffs. Prediction 3 is now prediction 2. (lines 128-
pe here]
) and I have added a paragraph (lines 87-104) which introduces heritability and discusses
genetics can influence life history tradeoffs.
4 make sure that tables and figures are labelled according to the order in which they appear
he text. For example, I think that table 1 has not yet been mentioned, so table 2 should be
le 1 etc.
ve fixed this problem by changing the order of the paragraphs in the methods section.
8. In addition, dominance and maternal effects will inflate h2 estimates to different extents
full-sib and parent-offspring regressions.
s is a good and important point. The footnote after line 183 (bottom of page 9) has been
ed (and a reference has been added) to read: “Assuming random mating, and no dominance,
ernal or interaction effects and negligible covariance between phenotypic values and
ironmental deviation, narrow sense heritability49 for parents and offspring and full siblings
be estimated as twice the Pearson’s correlation: h2=2 r.” Now it should be clearer that these
mates are for narrow sense heritability (additive genetic effects only) and that I assumed no
minance or maternal effects.
8. I can’t find this footnote.
s was an error. There is no footnote here.
0-224 and table 1. The table captions informs me that this is obtained from Pearson
relations and that “Full sibling and parent offspring correlation analyses were carried out
h equal weight to nuclear families.” Please clarify what the latter statement means. How was
udoreplication controlled for in the models? A partial correlation was used to control for
rbirth intervals, perhaps a regression approach would be preferable because it would allow
ontrol for multiple random effects such as individual identity of parents.
, to control for family size all correlations were weighted by number of siblings, sisters,
thers or offspring (e.g. a full sib pair in which the individuals have 4 full siblings is weighted
s much as a single full sib pair). I have added this explanation to the table 1 caption (lines
-672). Not weighting the data had no discernible impact on the correlations, however.
hough regressions controlling for some of the random effects would have provided additional
pe here]
rmation, I have not seen heritability estimates generated in this way and would therefore
e been unsure of how to interpret them. I also want readers to be able to compare the tables
wing overall correlations with the figures and supplementary material (table S1) showing the
relations across time.
3-240. Does lifespan include infant and child mortality? If so, is the relationship between
ber of siblings and lifespan driven by high numbers of infant deaths in families with many
dren? If so, there may in fact be no difference in adult lifespan between individuals from
ll and big families. The same effect would apply to LRS, if it includes values of 0 for
ividuals that died before reproductive age.
espan and reproductive estimates are for all individuals in the genealogy and include infants
children who died young as long as they were recorded. So, yes, it is possible that parents
simply replacing dead kids. I have revised lines 439-457 acknowledging this possibility but
ress reasons why I am dubious of this explanation.
2-288. This sections mentions the use of first cousins, implying that the data is organised in
h a way that it would be possible to extract full pedigree data and use an animal model that
ld make use of all levels of relatedness, rather than focussing on full-sibling and parent-
pring regressions. This would help to some extent with the problem of shared environments,
ause a full pedigree contains several levels of relatives that do not share a common
sehold. An animal model is already implemented for the SNP data, so it should be
ightforward to use one on the full dataset as well. The animal model would also allow to
trol for variation due to geographic area (which is currently investigated by comparing full-
to first cousin regressions) and any other pertinent effects that have been measured.
, this is true and, in retrospect, I wish that I had run a GLMM Animal model in addition to
full sib correlations and parent offspring regressions. I did so for the genetic data because
re were only 8,456 sibling pairs at the time (2012). Also, the computing power was such that
stricted maximum likelihood model run on the entire dataset caused the network at deCode to
sh (approximately 27 billion pairwise comparisons) and the computer ‘cluster’ that they used
genetic analysis was not available to me for non-genetic analysis. I could, however, have
e it by decade to minimize the number of comparisons in an animal model but first I would
e to have written code to extract a coefficient of relatedness between all individuals in the
pe here]
abase. In the end, I restricted my analysis to first cousins (and higher degrees of relatedness)
ause of my interest in the social relationships between relatives. I would still, however, have
n interested in comparing relationship amongst full siblings with parent and offspring
ociations to parse environmental effects.
2-313. I had to read this sentence several times to understand what you wanted to say.
ve edited these lines (316-319) to read “There are important differences between the
ironments we share with full siblings and those we share with parents. First, only full
ings share parents; and second only full siblings share a household before they are sexually
ure. Therefore, shared environments and resources are expected to impact full siblings and
ents in different ways“. I hope this helps to clarify.
7. I assume you mean to say which environmental factors that bias the heritability estimates
ards, and how these factors differ between parent-offspring and full-sibling estimates. The
of heritability estimates to mean parental investment becomes quite confusing in the
cussion, eg L 394-395 and other places).
ve edited the text to read (lines 320-332): “the observation that the relationship amongst full
ings is positively correlated with the relationship between parents and offspring suggests that
y are related and may be measuring similar things (see Figures 2a-2d).1 The estimates
ained from the correlations between parents and offspring may be interpreted as the quantity-
lity tradeoff faced by parents but may also provide insight into levels of PI. When the LHT
relations between parents and offspring are lower, full siblings are costly and PI may
refore also be low, but when parent-offspring correlations are higher, additional full siblings
not negatively affect one’s fitness, and we may expect that levels of PI are higher.
anwhile the heritability estimates obtained from the correlations among full siblings can also
e correlation amongst full siblings may be higher than between parents and offspring due to a shared
ronment (e.g. PI), but could also result from dominance, epistatic or maternal effects. Meanwhile the SNP
amongst full siblings is only measuring additive genetic variance which does not include epistatic, dominance
aternal effects. I suggest that the shared environment amongst siblings is the most likely reason for the
er correlation because the other genetic effects (epistasis and dominance) are less likely to be so volatile
ss decades (Figures 2a-d). Maternal effects, on the other hand, may be an important cause of the difference,
these effects are subsumed under PI. Finally, trait similarity between relatives is expected to be mostly driven

itive genetic variance.

nterpreted as a proxy for the effect that parental investment has on offspring fitness.2 When
ings reproduce alike and have similar lifespans, the effect of PI tends to be high but when
se traits are less similar, its’ effect may be lower. This interpretation is reasonable as long as
assume that part of the non-genetic similarity among full siblings is due to their parents.3”
s simpler interpretation (e.g. both parent offspring and full sib correlation may be considered
xies for PI) is now used here (Line 391-396) and everywhere else in the discussion section
ere I use the full sibling’s heritability estimate as a proxy for PI (after lines 320-332 where I
oduce the argument).
so added the following footnote (bottom of page 17) to help clarify this interpretation:
hroughout the rest of the discussion section the correlation amongst the reproduction or
spans of full siblings and the parent offspring correlations are interpreted broadly as a proxy
the impact of parents on offspring fitness, and sometimes more specifically as the effect that
has on offspring fitness.“
7-320. Full-sib regressions are theoretically expected to be higher than parent-offspring
ressions due to dominance, common environment and maternal effects, so this is not a
prising result.
s is an excellent point. Results from the full sibling’s SNP data (which estimate additive
etic variance only) revealed that the high similarity amongst full siblings was not due to
itive genetic variance, but may be driven by dominance, epistatic effects, maternal effects or
mon environments. I had suggested in this paper that the common environment shared by
siblings (or, as I have defined it in this paper (PI)) is the most crucial factor is because: 1) of
strong, positive relationship to the parent offspring correlation across time (i.e. similar
ironmental factors are affecting both relationships); and 2) both LHT values (lifespan and
S) fluctuate so much across time. Epistatic interactions and especially dominance effects are
likely to be this volatile across decades. While maternal effects may be an important cause
he difference, this variable is subsumed under PI. Also, trait similarity between relatives is
ected to be mostly driven by additive genetic variance (narrow sense heritability estimates-
hough we do not know whether actual PI was high or low, the impact of PI on offspring fitness may be
mated from the correlations amongst full siblings.
pe here]
and response to selection also depends on additive genetic variance (Hill et. al, 2008, Data
theory point to mainly additive genetic variance for complex traits). I have clarified this in a
tnote (bottom of page 16) (line 322).
2-326. I don’t understand this argument. If children are expensive to produce, and the costs
iblings are higher, surely this leads to a high, not low (L324), qq-trade-off (each offspring is
y costly, so you have few costly offspring rather than many cheap offspring)?
, this was a mistake. This section has been simplified so that both the full sibling LHT
tionships and the parent offspring correlations are interpreted as proxy’s for PI now so this
tence has been deleted.
5. Is there a statistical test of this that I missed? Looking at figure 1, it does not appear very
vincing to me that fertility trends precede longevity changes. They’re negatively correlated,
that does not mean that one is driving the other. Given that this result is discussed at length,
re should be some stats to support it.
, I did conduct a test. Lines 269-272 in the results section are: “A Granger causality test54
conducted to determine if there was a predictable time lag between fertility and mortality
s. Results revealed that average fertility rate was a significant predictor of average lifespan
. morality) one decade later (F=10.85, p=0.004) and two decades later (F=4.48, p=0.02).”
ve also changed the text in the discussion section to refer back to this section to
rthermore, results of a Granger test of causality suggest that the changes in fertility precede
nges in mortality“ (Lines 336-337).
1-343. This could be tested in your data, given you have data on both fertility rates and
spans.
, the question of whether or not parents, and particularly mothers, who have higher fertility
e reduced lifespans could have been tested with the full dataset (lines 343-345).
fortunately, however, even with the extensive summary data I retained off site, I am not able
o so.. I plan to do this in a future analysis, though.

ree. After further consideration, I have dropped this explanation/ interpretation of the data.
the paragraph prior to line 397 (in the original draft) was referring to prediction 5 in the
oduction. I have also deleted this prediction from the introduction because I do not test it
istically. I have also deleted this paragraph from the discussion and revised this section for
plicity and clarity. Now this much reduced section should just read as an observation that is
sistent with some of the other predictions (lines 385-396).

mments to the Author(s)
mary
s paper makes use of an unusual dataset from Iceland to test predictions from life-history
ory, and as such, is interesting to evolutionary anthropologists and biologists. In particular,
dataset contains genetic data that enable the author to conduct advanced statistical analyses
ease apart genetic and environmental effects. It is rich, to say the least, and the author has
e considerable work. As a consequence, however, the paper is dense and hard to follow in
e places. It is very long and is testing (too) many hypotheses. I am also not really convinced
some of the interpretations, which is likely due to the fact that there are so many analyses and
tractions (e.g. transformations) that one is left uncertain about the empirical validity of the
clusions. To simplify/clarify the paper, it may be helpful to organize the result section by
earch questions/predictions (those made by the end of the introduction). It may also help to
row down the number of research questions/findings.
ve reduced the number of predictions and edited both predictions and questions to make them
arer, more specific, and the results section is now organized and labeled with italicized
headings by prediction and question numbers to make the results easier to follow.
diction 5 has been eliminated and is now only included very briefly in the discussion section
n observation that is also consistent with the results (e.g. catastrophic events affect the
itability estimates in ways consistent with the other predictions). I have also eliminated some
he less substantiated interpretations of these results, such as the observed relationship
ween catastrophic events (e.g. volcanoes) and the age at which tradeoffs between investment
reproduction are calculated.

neral comments
bout the findings
re are interesting findings, for instance that decline in fertility precedes decline in mortality,
that “harsh conditions may trigger an increase in reproductive effort and a decrease in PI
offspring”. There are also counter-intuitive findings, i.e. “individuals reduce their
roductive effort when offspring are cheap to produce”. Here, however, I fail to understand
this validates life-history theory, as argued elsewhere in the paper. This needs to be
rified.
lieve that this comment refers to the apparent negative relationship between the parent-
pring correlation (for both lifespan and lifetime reproductive success and reproduction) and
an reproduction and or reproductive effort (figures 2a and 2b).
ve rewritten the entire section: “Evolutionary theory and implications for understanding the
ographic transition” (lines 398-419) where I speculate on why this may be the case. The
rpretation is now much simpler and I think clearer.
ve also eliminated the argument that “individuals reduce their reproductive effort when
pring are cheap to produce” because it was too complicated and was likely confounded by
her PI when fertility rates were low. It also just seemed to detract from the main results. This
tion now focuses on the implications that these results have for understanding the
ographic transition. I don’t know if these results validate life history theory, but they do
vide an explanation for the counter-intuitive observations of low fertility and mortality rates
ng with higher PI seen in post DT nations and is consistent with some evolutionary
rpretations of these observations (e.g. lower fertility associated with lower q-q tradeoffs)
es 398-419).
About the evidence of a quantity/quality tradeoff
h additional sibling reduces an individual’s LRS by 0.07 children. Given family size tends to
<5, I would argue that the effect (max = 5*0.07= 0.35 child) is negligible and that
ividuals do not face a substantial trade-off. It would help to comment on the size of effects.
pe here]
ve edited the MS and added the following footnote to line number 423 (footnote is at bottom
age 21) to discuss the effect size: “Although a reduction of almost a year in lifespan may
gest a reasonably impactful effect size, it may be argued that a reduction of .07 children per
ing is not particularly strong. This may be especially true because average family sizes in
and were relatively small (e.g. <5). However, due to the high number and complexity of the
ors (e.g. resources, PI and countless others) that contribute to LRS, I would argue that an
ct size of 0.07 children per siblings is actually quite high. This may be particularly true if, as
gested by researchers and historians, wealth and family size in 18th and 19th century Iceland
positively correlated.”
ittle is known about the Icelandic Ecology
at is the marriage system, socially imposed monogamy? Do men remarry more than women?
whole paper does not consider sex differences in the cost of reproduction but if remarriage
ore frequent for men than for women, for instance if women die in child birth leaving men
to reproduce with other women, than the cost of reproduction is likely lower for men.
ve added the following to the methods section and added a reference (lines 145-149):
though Íslendingabók does not have marriage records, the population is almost exclusively
nogamous, especially prior to1920, with extremely low divorce rates such that less than 5% of
ividuals in the genealogy have any half siblings and most of these involved the death of a
use.56 “
o, what was the main mode of subsistence? It would be helpful to comment on the level of
ource inequality given the dataset does not contain data on social status and resources.
ial inequality is expected to be quite low. I have added the following to the methods section
h references (lines 158-162): “Although, no data were available on material wealth,
upation or income for any individuals in the genealogy, Iceland is one of the most
ioeconomically and culturally homogeneous societies in the world and throughout the 18th
19th centuries the two major modes of subsistence available to Icelanders were fishing and
ep herding “
bout the inference on the amount of parental investment given the heritability of LHT
pe here]
LHT shows a low heritability, then it is assumed that there has been little parental
estment. This is because parental contribution makes little difference to the LHT. Yet this
ld be better phrased, as it is not known whether or not there has been a lot, or little, parental
estment. What is known is that whatever the level of PI, it had little effect on LHT. This is
ortant for improving the clarity of the two following points:
when siblings reproduce alike, parental investment is assumed to be high. But consider this: if
ings don’t have children, they reproduce similarly, however it can hardly be said that it
ults from high parental investment. Statement about amount of parental investment (low/high)
uld be rephrased in terms of contribution of parental investment to offspring fitness
w/high).
, this is an important distinction. It took me a minute to appreciate the difference and this is
bably why I overlooked it in the first draft. I have revised the entire first section of the
cussion section where I consider this (lines 316-332) and have changed any mention or
rence to interpreting the full sibling correlation as parental investment to ‘effect of PI on
ess”. Specifically, (lines 327-329) now read “Meanwhile the heritability estimates obtained
m the correlations among full siblings can also be interpreted as a proxy for the effect that
ental investment has on offspring fitness.4 and the footnote at the bottom of page 17 reads
though we do not know whether actual PI was high or low, the impact of PI on offspring
ess may be estimated from the correlations amongst full siblings.”
s error is also corrected by edits in the new MS that now include the possibility that the
ilarity amongst full siblings LHT’s may also be due to: 1) social and cultural influences such
ertility preferences AND/OR 2) maternal effects or non-additive genetic effects, such as
minance and epistasis.
324: “the costs of siblings are higher and the quantity-quality trade-off is low”. That sounds
tradictory. I am not sure I follow the reasoning behind the idea that if parent-offspring
relations are low, thus heritability is low, the quantity-quality trade-off is high. I would have
ected the quantity/quality trade-off to be low too, as PI has little effect on offspring fitness.
pe here]
, this was a typo. I have changed the text to “high” and in the next sentence to “low” (and
e also reviewed the entire MS for similar errors (lines 324-327).
bout the idea that shared environment inform on shared resources.
01: “the findings support the hypothesis that resources …have had important influences”.
the dataset does not contain data on social status. In addition, shared family factors may
ompass more than resources, those could be fertility preferences. Shared environment shapes
eral dimensions, socio-economic but also cultural.
s has been clarified in a new footnote (line 306, footnote bottom of page 15):
esources refer to parental resources distributed amongst offspring but the environments
red by full siblings may consist of several factors other than direct PI and resource
ribution which social and cultural influences such as fertility preferences.”

roduction and ‘average lifespan’ values in Table 2. This was done to provide a reasonable
pe here]
roximation of the average number of years, or children, one loses with the addition of each
sibling.5 “(lines 196-202)
ve also added a footnote (bottom of page 10) that reads:
his transformation was necessary to control for fluctuating lifespans and fertility across
ades. For example, it the negative relationship between one’s number of siblings (i.e. larger
ily sizes) and one’s fitness may be spurious because mortality was higher (e.g. shorter
spans) in decades when families were smaller (mean reproduction was lower). Converting
se residuals back into a real number just provides a rough idea of how many years, or
dren, are lost (on average) for each sibling gained.”
3: Reproductive effort as a population parameter; I find this confusing, reproductive effort
ally refers to individual parameters.
, reproductive effort does usually refer to individuals and has been defined as that proportion
he total energy budget of an organism that is devoted to reproductive processes. But I wanted
opulation wide variable that assessed reproduction while controlling for average mortality
s in the population.
ve changed the text to read:
also calculated the average fertility rate of the population per year of life which I have called
roductive effort’. This was the mean population wide fertility rate based on the mean lifespan
decade and was a way to determine reproductive rates while controlling for lifespan.” (line
-209). And added a footnote reading (bottom of page 11): “Although, reproductive effort is
ically used to assess the amount of energy an individual organism devotes towards
roduction, I have used it here as a population wide estimate to determine fertility rates that are
ependent of mortality rates (lifespans) across decades.”
1: why controlling for birth interval (trade-offs) between siblings when looking for trade-
?
s was done to determine if parents were responding to mortality rates in the population at
e or simply responding to local conditions (i.e., replacing their own dead children). In the
pe here]
cussion section (Lines 448-451), I write that if the latter were true, “If parents were simply
lacing their own children, especially infants, we would expect to see shorter birth intervals in
er families. Instead the partial correlations increase, which indicates that the observed
ilarities between the lifespans and LRS of full siblings are not due to differences in birth
rvals.”

ments to the Author(s)
d this paper interesting but fear it is over-interpreting the results. The author looks in detail at the
tionship between fertility and mortality in Iceland over two centuries. If I understand it correctly, two
ods of exceptionally high mortality (one from disease and one from a volcano) seem to be associated
density independent mortality (when parent offspring correlations with fertility or lifespan collapse ie
tality could be almost random). at other times next generation fertility is related to parents family size,
ough as Iceland enters the demographic transition the relationship also weakens, presumably because
ance in reproductive success goes down. Heritability is due to inheritance of the family environment
ily farm?) rather than genes or other maternal effects. However the presentation of the graphs does not
e this that easy to follow (so I may have got some of that a bit wrong).
ve simplified the figures and hope this helps to clarify (see below). Iceland does not enter
demographic transition until well into the 21st century (after World War 2) so the graphs
ich only represent data before1920) are all prior to the demographic transition in Iceland.
aware that this paper has already been reviewed by others, and hate to contradict them, but I think
interpretation of all these trends in terms of parental investment is over-extending the results to things
have not necessarily been found. I think we already know that there is usually some kind of quantity
lity tradeoff in human reproduction. A number of papers show that small sibships tend to have better
omes. However this is being used synonymously with PI, which I dont think it is - it might just be
uced competition for parental resources, which is less specific.
, PI may not be the only factor driving these relationships amongst family members. This is
important point and was also brought up by a previous reviewer. Several changes were made
orrect this problem. Some of these efforts include:
1) a footnote referenced on line 306 - “Resources refer to parental resources distributed
amongst offspring but the environments shared by full siblings may consist of several
factors other than direct PI and resource distribution which social and cultural influences
such as fertility preferences.”
2) A more detailed explanation of some of the other possible reasons for a higher
correlation, referenced on line 322- “1 The correlation amongst full siblings may be
higher than between parents and offspring due to a shared environment (e.g. PI), but
could also result from dominance, epistatic or maternal effects. Meanwhile the SNP data
amongst full siblings is only measuring additive genetic variance which does not include
epistatic, dominance or maternal effects. I suggest that the shared environment amongst
siblings is the most likely reason for the higher correlation because the other genetic
effects (epistasis and dominance) are less likely to be so volatile across decades (Figures
2a-d). Maternal effects, on the other hand, may be an important cause of the difference,
but these effects are subsumed under PI. Finally, trait similarity between relatives is
expected to be mostly driven by additive genetic variance (narrow sense heritability
estimates- h2) while response to selection also depends on additive genetic variance.60”.
3) Another footnote addressing this issue is also referenced on line 332- “ Throughout the
rest of the discussion section the correlation amongst the reproduction or lifespans of full
siblings and the parent offspring correlations are interpreted broadly as a proxy for the
impact of parents on offspring fitness, and sometimes more specifically as the effect that
PI has on offspring fitness.”
ould, however, place sibling competition for parental resources under the common umbrella
ompetition for PI because, as defined by Trivers (1972): ”any investment by the parent in an
ividual offspring that increases the offspring's chance of surviving (and hence reproductive
cess) at the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other offspring.”.
vertheless, this comment suggests that I need to make this point clearer. Therefore, I have
nged PI to the impact or effect of parents in several places (e.g. line 330, 350, 353)
phasizing the fact that PI is not the only possible influence. I have also added: “higher PI or
her competition for parental resources” (lines 371-372) and replaced PI with ‘resources and
estment’ in line 430 to further indicate that this may be the result of sibling competition.
ally, I have also lessened my focus on PI as the crucial factor in the discussion (this result is
ressed in a separate manuscript).
e points to make clearer are
ere are parent offspring correlations in fertiltiy but the graphs make it appear that at some points in
ory that parent/offspring correlations disappear during crises?
, this is correct (figure 2a and 2c). The parent to offspring correlations (and those among full
ings) BOTH seem to decline after the mortality shocks of the smallpox epidemic 1707-1709
the Laki volcanic eruption in 1783. I discuss why this might be the case in lines 374-388.
order to make some of these results clearers, the figures should include on that shows all the trends
r time, but then others that show the relevant correlations (rather than just reporting them on top of the
res - which in any case is not a good way to report them).
ve reconstructed the figures to simplify them. Hopefully they are now clearer and I have
ten rid of the correlation coefficients on the figures. I have now put all of these results in the
tions. I think this makes the figures easier to read. The interpretation is in the discussion.
rall I dont think this paper says much about parental investment. The ecological effects of disaster,
very and demogarphic transition are interesting however, so much of the analysis is interesting and
lishable. But I think they need to be discussed without equating every change to active changes in
ental investment. Ecological trends influence competition between siblings, and the food supply, which
d cause most of these effects wtihout parents greatly changing their behaviour. I would prefer a simpler
entation, more graphs of the relevant correlations, and less elaborate interpretation. The paper needs to
hortened, especially the discussion and i think more focused on the facts, not extrapolations. Much of
t is described as PI I would simply describe more broadly as changes in competition for resources.
, the discussion has been changed and shortened significantly. I removed a paragraph (lines
-357 in old version) discussing how the way contagious diseases are spread through
seholds could help to explain the relationship between family size and mortality. The figures
e been altered, and I have removed some of the more speculative interpretations. I agree that
ing competition does not necessarily mean competition only over PI or parental resources.
s is a valid point and I have sought to address this in lines 450-452: “Nevertheless, it may
be the case that some of these relationships between the LHT’s of close relatives results
m competition between siblings irrespective of parental resources or investment.”
iewer: 4
ments to the Author(s)
is a resubmission of a paper that has already been through one round of peer review, and it is clear
the author has made every effort to deal with the reviewers' comments. I think, in the main, it is
or's job to decide if the comments have been addressed adequately, and not mine, so I won't comment
cifically on this.
own views of the paper are that it represents a very interesting data set, of unprecedented detail for a
ern human population. The questions asked are interesting, and found the analysis and interpretation
ught-provoking. I have tried to keep my comments here to a minimum as I know how annoying it is to
denly have a whole new set of comments to deal with, that differ from the first.
d have some comments regarding the way the hypotheses are set up, and some queries about the data
lyses, however. These are detailed below:
6-27 "Because each successive sibling is expected to reduce the total amount of PI available
e will be an overall fitness cost of siblings."
ink I understand what is meant here, but the wording is slightly ambiguous. Presumably you mean that
ngs will reduce each other's fitness? Presumably if parents are optimising costs and benefits they should
duce the number of offspring that will maximise their fitness, i.e., the number that will ensure their
pring maximise their fitness too, or not? I'm not sure how sibling and parental fitness come together
e.
, this was meant to be an individual’s siblings – not children. Lines 126-127 have been
ified to read: “1) Because each successive child is expected to reduce the total amount of PI
ilable, offspring will incur a fitness cost for each additional sibling they attain.“
1-132 "Because individuals are expected to accelerate life histories when the risk of mortality
is higher, lifespan and fertility rates will be negatively correlated."
ve a concern about reverse causality and "endogenity" with this prediction. Producing more offspring
e quickly may well shorten the lifespan, i.e., high fertility may itself represent an increased mortality
. So presumably this prediction is made with respect to variation in some kind of external mortality risk?
o, what is it? Also LHT predictions with respect to mortality risk depend on where mortality exerts its
cts, i.e, on infant/juvenile mortality or on adults. So perhaps this prediction needs to be specified with a
more precision?
, this is a good point. I have added ‘extrinsic mortality’ on line 131. There is some
flicting evidence that increased reproduction shortens maternal longevity (see Jasienska,
9; Dribe, 2004; Lycett, et. al., 2000). I refer to this in the discussion (lines 343-345; and see
w et. al., 2008). Although this was not an a priori prediction, I show that fertility reductions
cede mortality reductions by 20 years or so (about a generation), which is not consistent with
possibility. (see lines 269-272 and 343-355) I do not, however, specify the developmental
e most at risk in the predictions (e.g. infant, juvenile, adult) because I was unsure when I
ducted these analyses which specific prediction(s) (due to the complicated ways in which
se variables are known to interact). I describe some of these complications that informed my
soning in the introduction (lines 46-65). I have also added a sentence in the discussion (lines
-356) to clarify that even though this was not an a priori prediction the data do suggest that
=reproductive mortality is the key factor: “The timing and direction of the changes in fertility
mortality rates in Iceland, seem to suggest that reduced fertility if likely lowering infant or
enile mortality rates. “
3-136 "Because both reproduction and investment in offspring are costs that parents are expected to
nce, fertility rates will be negatively correlated with parental investment while mortality rates will be
tively correlated with parental investment."
in, whose mortality rates? Offspring or adult mortality rates? And are these extrinsic or intrinsic
tality?
ve clarified this with ‘offspring mortality’ (line 155). I did not differentiate between intrinsic
extrinsic mortality because I was unable to distinguish between the causes of deaths (i.e.
insic such as those related to reproductive effort like child birth vs extrinsic like volcanoes)
ause there is no cause of death listed for individuals in the historic Íslendingabók database.
5.The concept of natural fertility is that it represents fertility where there is no parity-specific control of
hs, i.e, no stopping or spacing patterns after a certain number. Is this actually the case for Iceland? Their
lity is entirely controlled by physiological means? What about age of marriage does this vary in a way
suggests some form of fertility control. Is there any evidence that people were stopping after a certain
ber of children? If you simply mean in the absence of modern contraception, perhaps it could be
orded. Again, perhaps a bit more precision would be good here.
s is a good point. No, I do not mean for natural fertility to be interpreted in this way. What I
ant to suggest was the absence of modern contraception. I have changed the sentence (line
) to make this clear.
7-269 "(Question3/ prediction 3): Unsurprisingly, an individual’s lifespan was a positive and
ificant predictor of his/her reproduction (r= 0.449, N= 138,213, p<0.001). Across the
ulation, however, mean lifespan was a significant and negative predictor of mean
oduction (r= -0.45, p=0.013) (see Figure 1)."
t this simply an example of the ecological fallacy, or rather Simpson's paradox? You find one relationship
he individual level, and the opposite at the population level, where you used aggregate data. This can
e about simply because of differences in the variance at these two levels of analysis. You then go onto
the results at the aggregate level to make inferences about individuals, which is make be inaccurate as
nsequence.
that this means is that the longer individuals live the more kids they are likely to have but
average mortality rates (here assessed using mean lifespans) are predictive of individuals
ing more children (higher fertility rates). I do not think that this is an example of the
psons paradox because these are very different tests. The first relationship is obvious (e.g.
dren who die before reproductive age will not have any kids) and the second one simply
icates that average fertility rates are lower when overall (population wide) mortality rates are
h. The latter is the only interesting finding. I have deleted the first sentence/finding to
minate an intuitively obvious statement and have edited the text to clarify (lines 267-269):
cross decades the mean lifespan of the population was a significant and negative predictor of
mean reproduction of the population (r= -0.45, p=0.013) (see Figure 1).“
e generally with respect to the analyses, I was surprised that you didn't make more use of multilevel
elling techniques. Some analyses are based on simple correlations (which often involve aggregate data,
ch represents a loss of information). Is this because the dataset was simply too big to run more complex
els ? You suggest with respect to some of the analyses, so is that true here for some reason?
genetic analyses (lines 248-266) were meant to provide this type of Mixed Animal model
ML) but running a 8,456 X 8456 matrix required a substantial cluster of computing power
ch I had limited access to in 2011 when I conducted these analyses. To run mixed models for
historic data would have required a 153,000 X 153,000 individual matrix and I did not have
ugh access to the cluster to do this. But more importantly perhaps, it was always my
ntion to parse heritability estimates between different classes of close relatives using
relations and regressions. This was done so that I could compare and contrast these
erences in order to triangulate environmental differences (environments shared and not
red by different categories of relatives). Although multi-level mixed models would provide
re accurate historical heritability estimates (using SNP data is the best and least biased way to
this), my understanding is that these types of analyses would not produce the simple types of
parisons that correlations and regression allow.
