This paper discussed DNA extraction based on iron nanoparticles functionalized with
polyethyleneimine. The magnetic separation for DNA is a simple and efficient method.
However,some results should be explained more clearly. Therefore, I recommend that this
paper will be accepted for publication only after major revision.
1. The STEM image of Fe3O4 should be added in Fig. 1 and compared with PEI coated iron oxide
nanoparticles. Also, the size of nanoparticles should be explained in detail.
2. The VSM characterization should be performed and added to verify the magnetic property.
3. In the powder XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2, it is barely possible to distinguish the Fe3O4
peaks above the background noise. Perhaps the authors can replace the XRD patterns with
clearer patterns or at least explain why such noisy XRD patterns are presented?
4. The cytotoxicity study of synthesized nanoparticles may be evaluated, since the transfection
procedure was carried out.
5. The usage of capital and lower case in the paragraph should be corrected.
6. It would have been of interest to compare the adsorption capacity with commercial kits already
used in molecular biology labs

In this article, Adheesha N. Danthanarayana et al. reported a DNA isolation method using
polyethyleneimine functionalized magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. However, the idea of using
magnetic beads to isolate DNA is not new. There have been a lot of commercially available kits,
such as MagJET, Mag-BIND, MagMax. The novelty and advance of the method presented here is
not clear. It seems that the work presented here has less new contribution to this field. Thus, I
don’t recommend this work to be published in Royal Society Open Science from the view of
scientific contributions. However, the paper is well written, and the data are efficient to support
their conclusion. It could be published after minor revision.

The authors have addressed all of the concerns raised by the previous review. Given the
increased binding DNA capacity of the the materials presented here, this work may generate
interest by others in the community.

Response to Reviewers
Reviewer # 1
We would like to thank the reviewer 1 for providing us with constructive
comments. All responses are given in red color font.
Comment:
1. The STEM image of Fe3O4 should be added in Fig. 1 and compared with PEI
coated iron oxide nanoparticles. Also, the size of nanoparticles should be
explained in detail-
Response:
When compared with the neat IONPs (Figure 1) it is clearly understood that
the size of the particles has increased with the polymer coating. PEI is a very
sticky and a bulky polymer and when it interacted with IONPs would create a
cross-linked network of particles. The exact size was hard to determine as the
particles were embedded in a mesh of the polymer PEI and they seem to have
a diameter of 20 nm.
Comment:
2. The VSM characterization should be performed and added to verify the
magnetic property.
Response:
There are plenty of previous work in which the magnetic property of PEI
coated IONPs has been measured. Since we have followed a similar method of
preparation, we have not characterized the magnetic property via VSM [1], [2]
as it has already been reported. We have included references for VSM studies
of IONPs.
Comment:
3. In the powder XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2, it is barely possible to
distinguish the Fe3O4 peaks above the background noise. Perhaps the authors
can replace the XRD patterns with clearer patterns or at least explain why such
noisy XRD patterns are presented?
Response:
The image reported in the paper was captured with our old detector system
which produced noise. Recently we replaced the old detector with multistrip
Si detector with low angle capability. This has improved the quality of the
image with very low background noise. We have included this in the figure 2.
Comment:
4. The cytotoxicity study of synthesized nanoparticles may be evaluated,
since the transfection procedure was carried out.
Response:
There are lot of work carried out regarding the assessment of the cytotoxicity
of the PEI coated IONPs. [3], [4]. And it has been observed that the cytotoxic
effects of PEI IONPs are concentration dependent and only at high
concentration (more than 0.2 mg/mL) they induce a cytotoxicity [4]. As the
data is reported in the literature we have cited the references in the
manuscript.
Comment:
5. The usage of capital and lower case in the paragraph should be corrected-
Response:
Corrected
Comment:
6. It would have been of interest to compare the adsorption capacity with
commercial kits already used in molecular biology labs.
Response:
When compare with the commercially available kits [5], [6] showing
adsorption capacities such as 1.5 ug/100 ul (Mag Bind) and 5 ug/1 mL (Mag
JET), our system has given rise to very high adsorption capacities such as
27ug/100 uL for plasmid DNA and 42 ug/100 uL for genomic DNA.
