Revision of the manuscript titled: Emission characteristics and vapor/particulate phases
distributions of PCDD/F in a hazardous waste incinerator under transient conditions Ref. RSOS-
171079.
The manuscript seems to be in the scope of the journal and the topic studied is interesting and
timely. Authors focused the work on pollutants emissions produced by a hazardous waste
incinerator under transient operation.
In my opinion the manuscript is not completed. Authors have written in abstract section the
following:
PCDD/F emission characteristics and vapor/particulate phases partitions under three continued
operation conditions, i.e., shut-down, start-up and after start-up, were investigated by sampling
stack gas.
However, after revision I have not seen any figure representing the whole process in the same
figure: start up + stationary conditions + shut down for having an idea about the time evolution
of the whole process in order to distinguish each phase and then studied them separately.
In my opinion, authors have to explain the transient process graphically, for example, using some
parameters as temperature vs time and, on this Figure, to identify the transient processes studied.
I suggest to consult the following reference in order to see a way for representing transient
processes studied: Measurement Science and Technology, 23(4), 045302, 2012.
I have understood authors sampled in different points under several transient processes, for
example, shut down 1, 2, 3 and 4. However, it is not clear how similar these processes are second
by second or minute by minute. If these shut down processes have similar time evolution
profiles, then they are comparable. If not, then conclusions from samples registered at each point
can be wrong or it is very difficult to explain. Between transitions, there are different interactions
between precedent process (for example; after start up) with current process or between gas and
walls of the incinerator, etc.
The statement of the study is interesting but need to be better explained and justified.
If authors do that, then I can analyze presented results. In current form it could have some
uncertainties not analyzed.
I think, for that reason, conclusions are very simple. Now, conclusion section is a description of
results but, why these results are obtained compared to the operation conditions of the
incinerator is not explained.
Please, check this statement and take it to account along the text. If authors do not describe the
whole process as suggested then I decline to revise again this manuscript.

Response to reviewers
Dear Editor and Reviewers,
Thank you for your excellent review and for the numerous constructive comments and criticisms
concerning our manuscript (RSOS-171079). We are extremely grateful to the reviewers for their
hard work and for the resulting pertinent comments. Those comments are valuable and very helpful
for revising and further improving our paper. We have studied these comments carefully and have
made a large number of corrections, which we hope to meet with your approval. The revised part is
marked in red in the revised manuscript for your easy retrieval. The detailed corrections and
improvements marked in the manuscript and the responds to the reviewers comments are now
summarised as follows:
Reviewer 1: The manuscript seems to be in the scope of the journal and the topic studied is
interesting and timely. Authors focused the work on pollutants emissions produced by a hazardous
waste incinerator under transient operation.
Response: We greatly appreciate Reviewer 1 for his kind and judicious comments. His remarks
are always well taken.
1. In my opinion the manuscript is not completed. Authors have written in abstract section the
following:
PCDD/F emission characteristics and vapor/particulate phases partitions under three continued
operation conditions, i.e., shut-down, start-up and after start-up, were investigated by sampling
stack gas.
However, after revision I have not seen any figure representing the whole process in the same figure:
start up + stationary conditions + shut down for having an idea about the time evolution of the
whole process in order to distinguish each phase and then studied them separately.
In my opinion, authors have to explain the transient process graphically, for example, using some
parameters as temperature vs time and, on this Figure, to identify the transient processes studied.
I suggest to consult the following reference in order to see a way for representing transient
processes studied: Measurement Science and Technology, 23(4), 045302, 2012.
Response:This is a very helpful suggestion, and thanks for the recommend reference. The
descriptions of the three transient conditions and sampling arrangements were just in words, which
was not clear enough. The detailed description has been added to the manuscript, page 3, line 4 to
15.
As shown in Fig. 2, three continued transient operation conditions are depicted in the same figure,
temperature vs time was used to describe the whole process. The areas between the solid lines
were shut-down, start-up and after start-up conditions, respectively. And dotted lines represented
the sampling start time.

2. I have understood authors sampled in different points under several transient processes, for
example, shut down 1, 2, 3 and 4. However, it is not clear how similar these processes are second by
second or minute by minute. If these shut down processes have similar time evolution profiles, then
they are comparable. If not, then conclusions from samples registered at each point can be wrong or
it is very difficult to explain. Between transitions, there are different interactions between precedent
process (for example; after start up) with current process or between gas and walls of the
incinerator, etc.
The statement of the study is interesting but need to be better explained and justified.
If authors do that, then I can analyze presented results. In current form it could have some
uncertainties not analyzed.
Response: Thanks for the question. First of all, the flue gas samples were collected at the stack
under three transient conditions, just sampling at one point. The flue gas in shut-down 1,
shut-down 2, shut-down 3 and shut-down 4 were collected at the stack as the shut-down process
going, and representing four different conditions of shut-down process. And those four processes
were not similar second by second, the temperature evolution and combustion conditions during
those four processes were different from each other. We compared the PCDD/F concentrations and
congener profiles between four shut-down processes, aimed to study the temporal variations of
PCDD/F concentration and profile as the shut-down process going. Considering all the samples
were collected at the stack, so its not difficult to explain. Same as start-up and after start-up
processes.
3. I think, for that reason, conclusions are very simple. Now, conclusion section is a description of
results but, why these results are obtained compared to the operation conditions of the incinerator is
not explained.
Please, check this statement and take it to account along the text. If authors do not describe the
whole process as suggested then I decline to revise again this manuscript. .
Response: Thanks for this question. The results in conclusion section included the key findings in
this manuscript, and some related words have been added into the paper, page 18, line 7 to 9. And
other conclusions obtained compared to the operation conditions of the incinerator have explained
in the results and analysis section.
Reviewer: 2
1. In part 2, Measurements and materials (page 2), what kinds of materials were used in this
work? Municipal solid wastes, hospital wastes or any other materials? Authors should give the
properties of the material.
Response: Thanks for your kind reminding. The detailed information has been added into
manuscript, page 3, line 38 to 42.
The waste disposed in this incinerator are mainly industry hazardous waste with high thermal
value and toxicity, such as, waste organic solvents, pesticide waste, medical waste, waste mineral
oil, phenol waste, organic phosphides, etc. Due to the wide range and complex composition, the
composition of various types of wastes fluctuates significantly. The main chemical compositions
of hazardous waste are C (12%-45%), H (1%-9%), O (2%-13%), S (0.1%-0.3%), Cl (0.1%-4%), F
(0.1%-3%), P (0-3%), Si (0-15%), K (0-3%), Na (0-4%), etc. Before fed into the furnace,
hazardous wastes are usually matched together according to their compositions, calorific values
and other parameters. Generally, calorific value of the waste was approximately 3500 kcal kg-1,
chlorine content is below 4%.
2.In fig 11, the Correlation seems not good. The three data seems different with the fourth one.
Response: Thanks for the question. The related explanation has been added into the manuscript,
page 16, line 30 to 40.
Regression analysis was used to investigate the concentration correlation between PCDD/Fs with
PCB congeners, as shown in Fig. 11. R2 is coefficient of determination, which ranges from 0-1.
And the closer the value of R2 is to 1, the stronger the association between PCDD/F with PCB
congener. Most of the R2 values were above 0.99 in Fig.11, very close to 1, which means the
correlation seems good between PCDD/F and PCB congeners. And less-chlorinated PCB
congeners such as M1CB, D2CB were more strongly correlated with 2,3,7,8-PCDD/F
concentrations. As shown is Fig.11, a point stayed far away from the other three points, which
belonged to start-up 2. Because the PCDD/F and PCB concentrations in start-up 2 were higher
than those in shut-down 1, shut-down 3 and after start-up 2 processes.
3.In conclusion, authors indicated during the shut-down and start-up processes, the temperature
at the second combustion chamber should be quickly decreased or increased to avoid this
temperature region. In the engineering, how to control the temperature?
Response: Thanks for the question.
In engineering, the temperature at the second combustion chamber is monitored in real time. The
temperature in second combustion chamber is approximately 1100 °C under normal operation
condition. But in shut-down and start-up processes, the temperature region cannot be avoided. The
most common way to quickly decrease the temperature in second combustion chamber is using
high induced-draught fan. And the most common way to quickly increase the temperature in
second combustion chamber is using auxiliary burners with auxiliary fuels, such as light diesel.
Thank you so much for your questions and suggestions.
