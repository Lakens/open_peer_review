This is an excellent paper. The analysis is clear and in-depth.
There are some very minor comments which the authors may wish to consider:
- Figure 7 is difficult to read in colour, and impossible in Black & White.
- The reason why the median (P50) is used in wind energy to provide energy output estimates is
because it is invariant under monotonic non-linear transformations, while the mean, as you point
out, is not.

This paper analyses the effect of uncertainty of bed friction factor on power generation from tidal
turbines based on three idealised models: Garrett and Cummins (2005,2013) and Vennell(2010).
These models assume that flow is straight, parallel with fully developed boundary layer across
the depth. There appears to have been some comparisons with depth-averaged models which
require the input of a bed friction coefficient. The depth-averaged assumption is inherent in the
three idealised models. There is discussion on the magnitude of bed friction factor and its relation
to bed roughness. There is no discussion on whether the boundary layer is fully developed. An
estimate of boundary layer thickness d for oscillatory flows is given by d/k_N =0.09 (a/k_N
)^0.82 where a is particle oscillation amplitude and kN is Nikuradse roughness (about twice
3
roughness height), see Fredsoe and Deigaard (1994). For velocity amplitude of 3 m/s and tidal
period of 12 hours d is 61 m for kN=0.0001 m (silt in table 2 which is lower limit). Flow velocity
magnitude is not actually mentioned but I understand velocities need to be at least 3 m/s for tidal
turbines to be effective. d is thus likely to be greater than depth (50 m for deep channels) but it is
worth checking. More important flow curvature affects bed friction generally increasing its
magnitude. For wakes (of both headlands and islands) this may be by an order of magnitude, e.g.
Stansby et al (2016). I understand the Pentland Firth comprises headlands and islands. Curvature
can also cause significant secondary flows which affect dispersion and hence mixing. Curvature
may be due to bathymetry or wakes resulting from turbine interaction. Oceanographers use 3-D
models with hydrostatic pressure as a matter of practice. In the local wake region bed friction
coefficient is also likely to be increased due to enhanced turbulence mixing but this may be
regarded as part of the uncertainty in turbine induced drag. (In isolation thrust coefficient does
not give a good wake representation in a depth-averaged model.) The point is that the analysis
presented is valid for boundary layers developed through the depth and almost parallel flows
(implying widely spaced turbines). There is the question whether the idealised models have been
compared with physical experiments or detailed 3-D models as this would help the justification
of this analysis. I do not see this mentioned although the models are widely quoted; there is
certainly data available to do this. Assuming this can be addressed there is a case for publication.
The analysis seems quite sound and novel albeit quite dense and some figures can take a little
time to follow. However the conditions for which this analysis might apply in practice need to be
addressed.
Finally, what is Jensen’s inequality?

The reviewer would like to congratulate the authors for a very good paper. The following
comments, particularly comments 8, 9 and 11, could improve the paper in my opinion:
1- Sentence starting at page 3 line 32 is not clear.
2- Page 3 Line 49, It will be useful to highlight more clearly why these scenarios have been
selected in the introduction. One may think that more realistic scenarios, particularly in terms of
scenarios 1 and 2, could be more meaningful.
3- Sentence in page 5 line 20 is not clear.
4- Statement in Page 6 line 36 seems to be the case for only small turbine drag parameter. Could
you clarify please?
5- sentence in Page 6 line 46 needs more explanation.
6- Page 8 line 35 what is Q’.
7- Page 9 line 37. Is derivation of an expression for the expected power in V10, namely E[PV10],
published anywhere like a thesis? it might be helpful for the readers to have reference or include
them as an appendix.
8- Page 15 line 53. In reviewer's opinion, the values reported in Table 2 are not the only correct
values of roughness for different bed materials. Even if the bed roughness is known and constant
across the domain, the standard deviation could vary significantly comparing to the values
calculated here based on the Table 2. This is further highlighted by limited availability for some
cases such as Mud and Silt/sand in the table. Therefore, considering two different scenarios and
particularly one scenario where the values are considered as known is not accurate and should
change to highlight wide range of uncertainty in roughness if the writers keep two scenarios.
9- Page 18 line 34. It is useful to discuss various assumptions made and to what level these
assumptions could impact the results to avoid misunderstanding by various stakeholders.
10- Page 20 line 10. range of predictions of what?
11- Page 20 line 54 (last line of page 20). There are other sources of uncertainty and it might not be
accurate to associate big part of the variation in reported values to bed roughness uncertainty. It
is suggested that the author's look into the models used in these references and make sure that
the values used for roughness correspond to these extremes before associating major part of
uncertainty on these numbers.

The comments have been answered well, with one exception below, and the response to other
referees has also enhanced the paper. The contribution is well defined and original. However one
important condition for the analysis is that oscillatory tidal flow corresponds to fully developed
steady channel flow with an associated friction coefficient. A reader may get the idea from this
paper that this is universally valid and of course oscillatory boundary layers are different from
steady boundary layers. Some justification based on the boundary layer thickness, e.g. Fredsoe
and Deigaard (1994), being greater than the water depth should be included in my opinion.
In the response the authors give an analysis of the effect of a power law velocity profile on the
depth-averaged quantities. Incidentally the analysis looks rather similar to that in Liggett’s classic
text book. The power law relates to fully developed steady channel flow and that this occurs
requires some justification.

Authors’ Response
Associate Editor's Comments:
The referees see much of merit in your work, but they each have some concerns (ranging
from minor to major issues) that need to be addressed prior to further consideration. Most
notably, concerns were raised that key code for the models is lacking. As the journal
requires that authors submit their data, code or other digital research materials
(http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/author-information#Open_data), you must
provide this in any revision.
Response: Thank you for your kind comments regarding the paper, which are much
appreciated. The only part of our results that cannot be explicitly computed from the
equations given in the paper, and required solving using numerical methods, is the
optimum value of turbine drag parameter for the model of Vennell (2010). We have
appended the methodology for finding this as Appendix A to the document, along with
the explicit equations for expected power and variance to make the derivations clearer.
We have also added our Matlab scripts (written by the first author) to Dryad, as requested.
The DOI for the code is 10.5061/dryad.cp7v85c. Finally, we have addressed each concern
raised by the referees, as indicated below.
Reviewer #1 Comments
This is an excellent paper. The analysis is clear and in-depth.
Response: Thank you for your comments regarding the paper, which are much
appreciated.
There are some very minor comments which the authors may wish to consider:
- Figure 7 is difficult to read in colour, and impossible in Black & White.
Response: We agree with the reviewer that the figure was difficult to read and decided to
remove the coloured curves in Figure 7, moving them to a new figure 11 in Appendix B
alongside the information used to produce the figure. We hope this has made the figures
easier to follow.
- The reason why the median (P50) is used in wind energy to provide energy output
estimates is because it is invariant under monotonic non-linear transformations, while the
mean, as you point out, is not.
Response: This is a very useful comment. We have now included a brief comment on this
in the second paragraph of the Conclusion section which reads
“A similar issue is encountered in wind energy assessment, where the median is used
as a measure of power under uncertainty because it is invariant under monotonic
nonlinear transformations.”
Reviewer #2 Comments
This paper analyses the effect of uncertainty of bed friction factor on power generation
from tidal turbines based on three idealised models: Garrett and Cummins (2005,2013)
and Vennell(2010). These models assume that flow is straight, parallel with fully
developed boundary layer across the depth. There appears to have been some comparisons
with depth-averaged models which require the input of a bed friction coefficient. The
depth-averaged assumption is inherent in the three idealised models. There is discussion
on the magnitude of bed friction factor and its relation to bed roughness. There is no
discussion on whether the boundary layer is fully developed. An estimate of boundary
layer thickness d for oscillatory flows is given by d/k_N =0.09 (a/k_N)^0.82 where a is
particle oscillation amplitude and kN is Nikuradse roughness (about twice roughness
height), see Fredsoe and Deigaard (1994). For velocity amplitude of 3 m/s and tidal period
of 12 hours d is 61 m for kN=0.0001 m (silt in table 2 which is lower limit). Flow velocity
magnitude is not actually mentioned but I understand velocities need to be at least 3 m/s
for tidal turbines to be effective. d is thus likely to be greater than depth (50 m for deep
channels) but it is worth checking.
Response: We are grateful to the reviewer for this insightful comment. Using the
empirical formula provided by Fredsøe and Deigaard, and noting that <U+0001D458><U+0001D441> ˜ 30<U+0001D467>0 where
<U+0001D467>0 is the roughness height (taken to be 0.05 mm), we obtain a very similar result that <U+0001D6FF>
is 99 m for typical conditions. For a typical deep channel, the boundary layer is larger
than the water depth.
We would like to point out that the governing equations used in GC05, V10, and
GC13 are based on the one-dimensional depth-averaged shallow water equations, which
are essentially the same as the St Venant equations used in river flow modelling but with
the effect of the side walls of the domain neglected – a reasonable assumption in wide
channels. During the depth-averaging process, the non-uniform velocity profile through
the boundary layer can be accounted for, and appears as a correction to the uniform (rather
than boundary layer) flow momentum exchange. Amongst others, Falconer (1985)
provides a detailed derivation which highlights this aspect and may be outlined as follows.
The <U+0001D465>-momentum equation after depth integration (neglecting shear stress terms, though
this is not necessary for the derivation) can be written as
<U+0001D701>
<U+0001D715><U+0001D462>¯ <U+0001D715><U+0001D462>¯2 <U+0001D715><U+0001D701>

where <U+0001D462>¯(<U+0001D465>, <U+0001D467>, <U+0001D461>) is the local horizontal velocity component as a function of the vertical
elevation <U+0001D467> and time <U+0001D461>. Expanding the integrals using Leibnitz’ rule, defining the depth-
averaged velocity component as
1 <U+0001D701>
<U+0001D448>= <U+222B> <U+0001D462>¯ <U+0001D451><U+0001D467>, (2)
h -h<U+0001D460>
where h = h<U+0001D460> + <U+0001D701>, and substituting for <U+0001D462>¯ in terms of the depth-averaged velocity in the
convective acceleration term as <U+0001D462>¯ = <U+0001D448> + (<U+0001D462>¯ - <U+0001D448>), we obtain
<U+0001D715><U+0001D448> 1 <U+0001D715>(h<U+0001D448> 2 ) <U+0001D715><U+0001D701> 1 <U+0001D715> <U+0001D701>

Assuming a 1/7th power law,

giving

Rearranging (3) we have

This can be written as
<U+0001D715><U+0001D448> 1 <U+0001D715>(<U+0001D6FD>h<U+0001D448> 2 ) <U+0001D715><U+0001D701>

where <U+0001D6FD> is the momentum exchange correction for non-uniform depth profile. For a
turbulent boundary layer flow over rough bed, <U+0001D6FD> = 1.016. Thus, <U+0001D6FD> may be assumed to
be unity. We have amended the paper to include some discussion about this (see below).

More important flow curvature affects bed friction generally increasing its magnitude.
For wakes (of both headlands and islands) this may be by an order of magnitude, e.g.
Stansby et al (2016). I understand the Pentland Firth comprises headlands and islands.
Curvature can also cause significant secondary flows which affect dispersion and hence
mixing. Curvature may be due to bathymetry or wakes resulting from turbine interaction.
Oceanographers use 3-D models with hydrostatic pressure as a matter of practice. In the
local wake region bed friction coefficient is also likely to be increased due to enhanced
turbulence mixing but this may be regarded as part of the uncertainty in turbine induced
drag. (In isolation thrust coefficient does not give a good wake representation in a depth-
averaged model.) The point is that the analysis presented is valid for boundary layers
developed through the depth and almost parallel flows (implying widely spaced turbines).
There is the question whether the idealised models have been compared with physical
experiments or detailed 3-D models as this would help the justification of this analysis. I
do not see this mentioned although the models are widely quoted; there is certainly data
available to do this. Assuming this can be addressed there is a case for publication. The
analysis seems quite sound and novel albeit quite dense and some figures can take a little
time to follow. However the conditions for which this analysis might apply in practice
need to be addressed.

Response: Thank you for your perceptive comments. We agree that the tidal energy
models of Garrett & Cummins (2005, 2013) and Vennell (2010) are highly idealised and
assume uniform and parallel flow. However, they nevertheless provide insight into the
underlying physics of tidal energy extraction at regional scales. The prediction of GC05
for the maximum power from a channel is in broad agreement with numerical models
(see Sutherland et al. (2007), Karsten et al. (2008), and Adcock et al. (2013) who
modelled the Pentland Firth), though the other two models do not have similar validation.
For large turbine arrays and at large spatial scales, depth-averaged models provide a good
estimate of power potential because the bulk flow is adequately captured (see Adcock et
al., 2015). We use the models to develop rules of thumb which act as first-order
approximations lending insight into how uncertainty propagates through a simple system.
Insight into how changing the physical assumptions in the power models affects
uncertainty propagation is developed by considering each of the models in turn. We have
added the following text to the Introduction section to make these aims clearer.
“Insight into the effect of the underlying physical assumptions on uncertainty
propagation is developed by considering closed-form solutions for power dissipated
as predicted by three analytic models of power tidal power assessment. The first
model is that of Garrett & Cummins (2005) (henceforth GC05), who derive an
analytic solution for quasi-steady flow in a channel spanned completely by tidal
turbines. Second, we explore the impact of retaining inertia by examining the solution
to the same governing equation by Vennell (2010) (henceforth V10). V10 is able to
include inertia in a closed-form solution by making further approximations (see
appendix of V10). Third and finally, we examine the effect of flow diversion around
the turbines by considering Garrett & Cummins (2013) (henceforth GC13), who
consider a circular turbine farm in laterally unconfined flow.”
Furthermore, to clarify the limitations of the tidal models used, and to address the
comments on the depth of the boundary layer and flow curvature, we have added the
following text to the last paragraph of the Conclusion section
“There are a number of limitations to these findings. First, the models considered
herein are idealised and do not take into account the complex bathymetry of actual
tidal sites and associated flow curvature, the complexity of the tidal forcing
components, or deformation of the free surface. This limits the extent to which the
findings from the models may be applied to real sites that exhibit such features.
Furthermore, the models used are depth-averaged and so provide suitable power
estimates only for regional scale energy extraction by large turbine deployments
(Adcock et al., 2015). "
Finally, we agree that, in practice, a more accurate procedure to assess the impact of
uncertainty would be to use two or three-dimensional numerical models to determine how
uncertainty propagates from the model input through to the extractable (or indeed
available) power. This procedure would take the form of
<U+F0B7> Setting up the two or three-dimensional numerical model for a particular site and
given bathymetric data.
<U+F0B7> Running the model for a set of bed roughness coefficients and turbine drag values
to populate a power surface in these two variables.
<U+F0B7> Define a probability density function for the bed roughness coefficient and
transform this through the developed surface to obtain expected power, standard
deviation for power, and optimal turbine drag as a function of the turbine drag
parameter, mean bed roughness coefficient, and standard deviation.
The work suggested is outwith the scope of the present paper and represents a different
study than the one undertaken herein. However, the authors are currently in the process
of writing a companion paper where a two-dimensional numerical model of the Pentland
Firth is being used to investigate the ability of the rules of thumb to capture the effect of
uncertainty in bed roughness coefficient on power dissipated, utilising the above
methodology. To address this, we include a sentence in the last paragraph of the
Conclusion section stating “Future work, using a numerical model applied to a real site
such as the Pentland Firth (e.g. that of Adcock et al. (2013)), would take these [effects]
into account and could thus be used to validate the predictions made in this paper.”

Finally, what is Jensen’s inequality?
Response: Jensen’s inequality is a result from probability theory and, within the context
of the discussion in the paper, states that the transformation of a mean through a convex
function is less than or equal to the mean applied after the convex transformation. We
have added commentary on Jensen’s inequality in section 2.a.i reading
“This convexity results in an asymmetric power dissipation for symmetric
perturbations in <U+0001D706>0 and thus an increase in the expected power (cf. Jensen's inequality,
which states that a convex transformation of the mean of a random variable is less than
the mean of the convex transformation of the variable).”
We hope this makes the reference in the discussion more accessible. See, for example:

Reviewer #3 Comments
The reviewer would like to congratulate the authors for a very good paper.
Response: Thank you for your kind remarks concerning the paper.
The following comments, particularly comments 8, 9 and 11, could improve the paper in
my opinion:
1 - Sentence starting at page 3 line 32 is not clear.
Response: We believe this comment refers to page 2, line 32. Based on subsequent
references made in this review, all references to pages appear to be shifted in page number
by +1. The sentence previously reading
“Adcock et al. also found that no single value of C0 produced results in full agreement
with observations, and settled on a value of C0 = 0.005 in a compromise between
matching model predictions and field measurements of the tidal phase and the current
magnitude for the Pentland Firth.”
has been amended to read
“In addition, Adcock et al. found that no single value of C0 applied throughout the
modelled domain produced results which matched the field measurements of both
tidal phase and current magnitude for the Pentland Firth, and settled on a value of C0
= 0.005 in a compromise.”
In addition, we have also changed the sentence ending on page 3, line 32 to read
“Using our best estimate for the magnitude of the uncertainty in background
roughness coefficient, we provide quantitative estimates of the effects of uncertainty
on expected power dissipated and optimal channel design.”
2 - Page 3 Line 49 (we believe this refers to page 2, line 49). It will be useful to highlight
more clearly why these scenarios have been selected in the introduction. One may think
that more realistic scenarios, particularly in terms of scenarios 1 and 2, could be more
meaningful.
Response: This is a good point. The aim of the paper is to develop an intuitive
understanding of the propagation of uncertainty from the bed roughness coefficient
through to the power estimates. The models introduced in the paper were chosen for
analysis because they provide closed-form solutions for power in terms of natural bed
roughness and turbine drag parameters. This offers a simple way to capture the key
physics and to understand how the effect of uncertainty is affected by changing model
assumptions.
To make this clearer, we have changed the text of the last paragraph of the introduction
to include the text:
“Insight into the effect of the underlying physical assumptions on uncertainty
propagation is developed by considering closed-form solutions for power dissipated
as predicted by three analytic models of power tidal power assessment. The first
model is that of Garrett & Cummins (2005) (henceforth GC05), who derive an
analytic solution for quasi-steady flow in a channel spanned completely by tidal
turbines. Second, we explore the impact of retaining inertia by examining the solution
to the same governing equation by Vennell (2010) (henceforth V10). V10 is able to
include inertia in a closed-form solution by making further approximations (see
appendix of V10). Third and finally, we examine the effect of flow diversion around
the turbines by considering Garrett & Cummins (2013) (henceforth GC13), who
consider a circular turbine farm in laterally unconfined flow.”
3 - Sentence in page 5 line 20 is not clear.
Response: We believe this comment refers to the sentence beginning with “The average
power produced by the turbines…” We have changed the sentence to make clearer the
calculation of power dissipated by the turbines by replacing it with
“The power dissipated by the turbines is given by multiplication of the turbine drag
term by the mass flow rate, i.e. <U+0001D443> = <U+0001D70C><U+0001D6FF><U+0001D447> |<U+0001D444>|<U+0001D444>2 , where <U+0001D70C> is the fluid density. The
average power extracted by the turbines over a tidal cycle is then <U+0001D443>¯ = <U+0001D70C><U+0001D6FF><U+0001D447> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
|<U+0001D444>|<U+0001D444>2 =
<U+0001D70C>(<U+0001D454><U+0001D44E>)2 (<U+0001D6FE><U+0001D714>)-1 <U+0001D706> <U+0001D447> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
|<U+0001D444>'|<U+0001D444>'2 , where the overline notation indicates time-averaging over
the tidal period.”
4 - Statement in Page 6 line 36 (page 5, line 36) seems to be the case for only small turbine
drag parameter. Could you clarify please?
Response: As may be seen in Figure 2, for both values of mean bed roughness parameter
(i.e. large and small channels), the dashed ‘uncertain’ lines lie above the continuous ones.
While the effect is greatest for small turbine drag parameters, it is still exhibited as the
value increases. We have amended the text of the paragraph indicated to read:
“This effect is greatest for <U+0001D706> <U+0001D447> = 2<U+0001D707><U+0001D706>0 /5, which maximises the second term in (2.5),
but remains positive for all values of <U+0001D706> <U+0001D447> , reducing in strength as <U+0001D706> <U+0001D447> increases (and
the effect of background roughness becomes less important).”
5 - Sentence in Page 6 line 46 (page 5, line 46) needs more explanation.
Response: This section was intended to be a pedagogical explanation of Jensen’s
inequality which we have made explicit by adding the following sentence at the end of
the paragraph.
“This convexity results in an asymmetric power dissipation for symmetric
perturbations in <U+0001D706>0 and thus an increase in the expected power (cf. Jensen's inequality,
which states that a convex transformation of the mean of a random variable is less than
the mean of the convex transformation of the variable).”
6 - Page 8 line 35 (page 7, line 35) what is Q’.
Response: Primed variables refer to non-dimensional variables which were introduced to
obtain equation (2.2). To clarify this, reference to (2.2) has now been added in line 35 as
well as the statement:
“… where <U+0001D444>’ is the non-dimensional flow rate…”
7 - Page 9 line 37. (Page 8, line 37.) Is derivation of an expression for the expected power
in V10, namely E[PV10], published anywhere like a thesis? It might be helpful for the
readers to have reference or include them as an appendix.
Response: We have added a detailed derivation of the expected power, variance and
optimum turbine drag for V10 as an appendix. The derivation will also appear in the first-
author’s PhD thesis, which is due to be submitted by the end of 2018.
8 - Page 15 line 53. (Refers to page 14, line 53.) In reviewer's opinion, the values reported
in Table 2 are not the only correct values of roughness for different bed materials. Even
if the bed roughness is known and constant across the domain, the standard deviation
could vary significantly comparing to the values calculated here based on the Table 2.
This is further highlighted by limited availability for some cases such as Mud and
Silt/sand in the table. Therefore, considering two different scenarios and particularly
one scenario where the values are considered as known is not accurate and should
change to highlight wide range of uncertainty in roughness if the writers keep two
scenarios.
Response: We agree with the reviewer that the data quoted in Table 2 is by no means
exhaustive and, as such, sets a limit on the accuracy of the quantitative estimates.
However, we are mainly interested in the variation factors given in Table 2 to obtain a
sense of the spread of possible <U+0001D436>0 values at a site. A better way of describing the two
scenarios in this section might be “limiting scenarios” for the given data, rather than
“possible” scenarios, because the scenario in which the bed conditions are known with
certainty is a lower limit. To address this source of possible confusion, we have
amended the text of the paragraph immediately preceding equation (3.1) to address
this explicitly. The text now reads
“When considering how to apply results such as those shown in Table 2 to a site,
several scenarios in terms of available information and associated uncertainty are
possible. Of these we consider two limiting scenarios. The first scenario is where
accurate knowledge of the bed conditions exists, and the relevant value of relative
standard deviation <U+0001D70E><U+0001D467>0 /<U+0001D707><U+0001D467>0 in the final column of Table 2 may be used. This we
consider a lower limit on uncertainty, identical to that of conditional model
uncertainty in subsection (c). In the second scenario, the bed conditions may be
entirely unknown or might vary across a site. Assuming this latter limit, which forms
a more realistic estimate, we proceed…”
9 - Page 18 line 34. (Refers to page 17, line 34.) It is useful to discuss various assumptions
made and to what level these assumptions could impact the results to avoid
misunderstanding by various stakeholders.
Response: We believe this is a useful addition and that it might be more appropriately
addressed in the Conclusion section. There we have added the following text at the end
of the first paragraph
“This estimate constitutes a lower limit for uncertainty in the bed roughness
coefficient at a particular site for the data presented in Table 2, because it is assumed
that the bed conditions (and their variability) are known. In reality, this knowledge is
unlikely, and so the uncertainty in <U+0001D436>0 is likely to be greater. Furthermore, spatio-
temporal variability in bed conditions, which is not discussed here, will act to
increase the value for <U+0001D70E>^<U+0001D436>0 . For a given site, the uncertainty may be constrained by
performing appropriate seabed surveys and a better estimate for bed roughness
coefficient may be found, though uncertainty will remain.”
10 - Page 20 line 10. (Page 19, line 10.) Range of predictions of what?
Response: The sentence has been amended to read “...associated with the range of
predictions for <U+0001D436>0 from the different models outlined in Table 3” to make clear what is
being referred to.
11 - Page 20 line 54 (last line of page 20) (Refers to page 19). There are other sources of
uncertainty and it might not be accurate to associate big part of the variation in reported
values to bed roughness uncertainty. It is suggested that the author's look into the
models used in these references and make sure that the values used for roughness
correspond to these extremes before associating major part of uncertainty on these
numbers.
Response: We agree with the reviewer that the large range of values reported for mean
power from the Pentland Firth is greatly affected by the choice of model, the physics
incorporated, etc., as well as uncertainty in bed friction and other physical/model
parameters. For example, the two estimates of 0.62 GW (by ABP MER (2007)) and 9
GW (by MacKay (2008)) use the undisturbed kinetic energy flux to determine the power
potential for the Pentland Firth from a given flow velocity but do not include bed
roughness in these calculations. The difference in the values reported result from
refinement of model mesh, and the use of efficiency coefficients. Given that our paper
addresses one significant source of uncertainty, bed friction, but does not deal with all
other uncertainties, we have decided to moderate our Conclusion by altering the relevant
sentence to read as follows
“For a mean power of 5 GW (the mean of the range 0.62–9 GW given in the
Introduction) then, the range of likely values for power estimates from the Pentland
Firth is 2–8 GW, spanning a significant portion of the range of reported values.
However, it must be emphasised that the reported estimates are taken from different
models, with different physical assumptions, containing sources of uncertainty other
than bed friction (the focus of the present paper) and which may contribute to a
greater extent to the range of mean power estimates reported above.”

Authors’ Response
Associate Editor Comments to Author:
While the referees consider your paper to be almost ready for publication, there are a
couple of remaining issues requiring attention. Please note reviewer 2's comments, in
particular in relation to the similarity of this work to earlier publications: please ensure
it is made clear how your work is a meaningful contribution.
Response:
We are very happy to be considered for publication and have addressed the one minor
point raised by reviewer 2, as indicated below. We feel that a change to the paper in
response to this would only confuse the readership.
We would like to note that the “similarity of this work to earlier publications” noted
by the editor in the comments of reviewer 2 refers to an analysis outlined in our
previous response to the reviewer, and not to the work in the paper. The analysis is
established theory (i.e. textbook material). If desired, we would be happy to provide
such analysis as an appendix or supplementary material.

valuable contribution to the literature.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The comments have been answered well, with one exception below, and the response to
other referees has also enhanced the paper. The contribution is well defined and
original.
Response:
Thank you for your very kind comment. We are glad our responses have improved the
paper. We address your final comment below.
However one important condition for the analysis is that oscillatory tidal flow
corresponds to fully-developed steady channel flow with an associated friction
coefficient. A reader may get the idea from this paper that this is universally valid and
of course oscillatory boundary layers are different from steady boundary layers. Some
justification based on the boundary layer thickness, e.g. Fredsoe and Deigaard (1994),
being greater than the water depth should be included in my opinion. In the response the
authors give an analysis of the effect of a power law velocity profile on the
depth-averaged quantities. Incidentally the analysis looks rather similar to that in
Liggett’s classic text book. The power law relates to fully developed steady channel
flow and that this occurs requires some justification.
Response:
We emphasise that the application of the shallow water equations to tidal flows is
standard because the period of tidal oscillations is much greater than the timescale
required for boundary layer development. In other words, the problem can be
considered steady. Indeed, this assumption is so standard that it is not motivated in the
seminal papers by Garrett & Cummins (2005), Vennell (2010), and Garrett & Cummins
(2013) upon which our paper is based. It is indeed correct that the analysis included for
completeness in our previous response can be found in many textbooks, such as
Liggett’s.
