Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
I appreciate the changes made to the manuscript in response to my previous comments and I
think that this is a valuable contribution to the field of sensory ecology, but for different reasons
than the authors pose.
The comparison between temperate and tropical birds seems to be a post-hoc decision to give the
paper a unique selling point. I don't think this is necessary and actually makes it easier for people
working on light pollution to ignore the fact that noise can be important too (by focusing mainly
on temperate birds). If a comparison between temperate and tropical birds was what the authors
were after I would have liked to see at least multiple tropical species and preferably a direct
comparison (although I understand this is logistically challenging). Now we are left with an n = 1
case. Furthermore, like I pointed out before, chaffinches, the most closely related species to
sparrows from the study by Kempenaers also don't change their timing in song in relation to light
pollution. So perhaps we're looking at a phylogenetic effect, rather than ecological effect.
I think that the authors underestimated the design of their study. They actually chose their
sampling sites carefully, allowing them to assess the independent as well as combined effects of
noise and light pollution. Also, as pointed out by Halfwerk & Slabbekoorn, we lack data on
covariance between these two pollutants. Reporting the covariance levels upfront (not as
supplementary material), reporting the stats on combined effects (not simply mentioning it in
methods) would greatly improve the importance of this paper.
The authors also present their results as counter-intuitive to what most people expect. I agree that
the fact of noise pollution on song timing is often ignored, but I also think that the authors
somewhat downplay the results from previous studies. In particular experimental work by
Arroyo-Solis et al deserves more attention. Their study does not 'suggest' that noise effects
dawnsong timing, it 'demonstrates' it.
I think the paper would be much stronger by focusing on the underestimated effects of noise on
dawnsong timing and would be cited/referred to more by people working on light pollution.
goodluck!

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors have conducted a study of noise pollution and light pollution and how they
influence the time of the first song of the morning in a wild tropical bird, the Rufous-collared
Sparrow. They studied 38 sparrows living in urban areas (n=33) and rural areas (n=5) in
Colombia. Based on the urban areas, they report no relationship between first song time and light
levels, but a significant pattern between first song time and noise levels. As the authors point out,
this has never been studied in the tropics, and there is compelling reason to think that tropical
birds will be less sensitive to light cues for influencing their behaviour in comparison to widely-
studied temperate birds. The result that noise levels do indeed influence first song time, but light
levels do not, is exciting.
But there are many challenges with this manuscript.
The sample size and sampling design is never made clear, and I think there may be a problem
with the sampling design. There authors draw a focus on their 33 urban sites. They never state
when each site was visited (this would be a good addition to the supplement, perhaps). But based
on my counts from Figure 1, the authors visited 18 of the sites in May-June and 15 DIFFERENT
sites in November through December. If my understanding is correct this means that different
sites were visited in the two seasons. (A much more powerful design would have been to visit all
the sites in the same season – preferably the breeding season -- or the same sites in the two
different seasons.) When the authors state “the relationship [between first song and noise level]
depended on the season”, in fact we don’t know if it was due to the season, or some other un-
measured variation between the sites. Season is confounded by the two different groups of sites.
When they state “there was such a marked seasonal effect”, etc., we don’t know if it is season, or
site. In any case, the sampling design needs to be presented more clearly, including the authors’
motivation for choosing the sites the way they did, and why they chose those times of year, etc.
The authors state that the breeding activities of the birds was unknown (line 287). This is
disappointing, because the start of the dawn chorus is widely known to show a strong influence
of breeding stage. Surely some information must be available to know whether birds are breeding
in May-June or November-December? This, by itself, could be the reason for the “marked
seasonal effect” reported in the manuscript. Even if it is through reference to other studies,
attempting to estimate whether the study birds were breeding or not in the two seasons would be
a welcome addition.
Why did the authors never compare the 5 rural sites to the 33 urban sites? (Or maybe just the 18
urban sites that were measured in May-June, since the rural sites were measured in June.) I
would really like to know whether there was significant variation in noise levels, light levels, and
first song time between the 5 urban sites and the 18 or 33 rural sites. Obviously this would have
to be a nonparametric test. If the story about “no effect of light but a strong effect of noise” holds
up in the urban-versus-rural comparison, this would be a compelling addition to the manuscript.
4
A map of the 33 urban sites (and probably the 5 rural sites) would be a good addition to the
manuscript, probably as a supplement. For others to be able to replicate this work, or seek to find
the other factors that are influencing the pattern reported here, they would need to be able to find
the sites.
Another compelling addition to the manuscript would be some spectrograms or power spectra of
the traffic noise at the different sites, as well as some songs of Bogota Rufous-collared Sparrows,
providing the reader with an idea of whether the noise overlaps the frequency range of this
species.
Stylistic comment
The writing in the Introduction and Discussion needs some more attention and editing. There are
longwinded sections where the writing is not quite up to journal standards. Example: “Related to
this, dawn singing would emerge earlier in the season through an earlier entry into the
reproductive stage in areas with artificial light at night. However, in addition light also directly
influences the onset time of dawn chorus in the morning.” Also, there are sections that are quite
repetitive. Also, there could be more done to keep each paragraph focused on a specific topic.
Other significant points
Line 165-168: The authors state HOW they tested for normality, but never actually report whether
their data were normal.
Lines 185-186: The authors could explain how these ranges of light levels and noise levels
correspond to descriptive terms, so that the reader can relate to these results. Does 9.4 lux
correspond to a bright parking lot, or a single lightbulb? Does 75 dB correspond to a busy multi-
lane highway, or a quiet side street?
Line 266 and elsewhere: Be careful about the language of “started singing later” versus “started
singing later relative to sunrise”. It is worthwhile to continue to recognize that the times are
relative to sunrise.
Line 286: The authors state that there was no meteorological differences between the two
sampling seasons, and make reference (#41) to a weather website. A weather website! I guess the
author is supposed to look up the weather data for the two study periods and run their own
analyses? But when I visit the website (eltiempo.net), I see that it doesn’t even contain historical
weather data, only this week’s weather forecast (not weather data, but a forecast). This isn’t very
impressive.
Other small points
Line 107: I don’t think this species comes into the North Temperate zone.
Line 109: State the distance to the equator. (And elsewhere, I think you should report the
variation in day length over the course of the year.)
Line 139: If correct, be straightforward in saying that one site was visited per day.
Line 159: What type of sunset? Nautical?
Line 153: How did you choose peak traffic hours? What data supports the notion that these are
peak hours?

The review I was sent includes two earlier reviews of this manuscript that appear to be for
Proceedings B, and the responses of the authors to the reviewers. I’m not sure if was an
expectation that I would comment on this aspect of the manuscript or not. I would point out that
the authors haven’t taken the original two reviewers’ brief suggestions very carefully.
Example: Reviewer 1 asked you to please specify more details about the site selection, but your
new line at 124-127 doesn’t do an adequate job of this (all you say in these new sentences is that
you chose 33 sites to show a range of noise and light pollution levels, and it doesn’t mention the
rural sites).
Example: Reviewer 2 asked for the distance between sites, including rural sites, but the authors
have not provided this information. (It was a good idea.)

Comments to the Author:
Two reviewers have kindly commented on your manuscript, and their reports should be given
below. Based on these and my own reading of the manuscript, I think there is potential in the
study you present, but there is a lot in the manuscript that could be changed and clarified before
it is possible to assess the soundness of your study.
Reviewer #2 in particular notes that there are many details that are missing that make it difficult
to interpret exactly what you did, and asks why you didn't consider including location within
your model (especially since you mention that there is a ten minute difference in dawn chorus
between urban and rural areas).
I think Reviewer #1 is also justified in suggesting that you focus less on the 'tropical' story you
present: you are only discussing one species studied in a relatively small area, and should maybe
reduce some of the emphasis throughout the manuscript.
If you choose to revise your manuscript, please could you make sure that you address each of the
reviewers' comments in full.

The authors have done a commendable job with their revisions, and taken the advice of the
reviewers seriously. I am happy with the edits to their manuscript that they have made in
response to my comments, and I think they’ve taken the other reviewer’s comments seriously too,
as well as now addressing several issues from an earlier round of review that they had neglected
in the first revision. (I am Reviewer 2 in the second round of review; I was not involved in the
first round of review.)
I feel that the revised manuscript now draws conclusions that are supported by the data. This
work advances our understanding of the influence of noise pollution and light pollution, and
their effect on wild birds. It expands this area of research into the tropics, which have received
little attention from this perspective.
In keeping with the journal’s mission, it should be more clear which data will be publicly
available. The recordings? The light level measurements? The noise level measurements? All of
the above (hopefully)?
The biggest limitation of the paper, as it stands, is the English writing. There are many grammar
and spelling problems, as well as style problems. Are started noting them on the first two pages
of the manuscript (see below). They persist throughout the manuscript. More careful editing
work should be done by the authors. I won’t provide further details, because I think that it goes
beyond what is typically expected from a reviewer.
14: Cut “It is observed that” from the opening.
17: Change “song” to “vocal”?
19: Cut “reproductive”.
25: I’m glad you state “may be less sensitive”. This is appropriate.
33-35: Seems like a run-on sentence.
36: “often need” or “may need”?
11
36: Cut “whole”?
40: Change “flows” to “flow”.
43: Cut “Indeed,”.
50: Change “The reproduction of birds” to “Avian reproduction” or “Bird reproduction”.
61: Cut “suggesting its adaptive value”?
76: “has also” should be “also has”.
Apart from the stylistic problems, I think the revised work is a compelling contribution ,
expanding our understanding of noise pollution to tropical environments.

available. The recordings? The light level measurements? The noise level measurements? All of
the above (hopefully)?

The biggest limitation of the paper, as it stands, is the English writing. There are many grammar
and spelling problems, as well as style problems. Are started noting them on the first two pages
of the manuscript (see below). They persist throughout the manuscript. More careful editing
work should be done by the authors. I won’t provide further details, because I think that it goes
beyond what is typically expected from a reviewer.

Manuscript revision report "Anthropogenic noise, but not artificial
ight levels predicts song behaviour in an equatorial bird"
Reviewer: 1
appreciate the changes made to the manuscript in response to my previous comments and I think
hat this is a valuable contribution to the field of sensory ecology, but for different reasons than the
authors pose.
The comparison between temperate and tropical birds seems to be a post-hoc decision to give the
paper a unique selling point. I don't think this is necessary and actually makes it easier for people
working on light pollution to ignore the fact that noise can be important too (by focusing mainly on
emperate birds). If a comparison between temperate and tropical birds was what the authors were
after I would have liked to see at least multiple tropical species and preferably a direct comparison
although I understand this is logistically challenging). Now we are left with an n = 1 case.
Furthermore, like I pointed out before, chaffinches, the most closely related species to sparrows
rom the study by Kempenaers also don't change their timing in song in relation to light pollution. So
perhaps we're looking at a phylogenetic effect, rather than ecological effect.
Response: We fully agree with the reviewer that a focus on temperate birds is holding back progress
n this field of research. Therefore, we have deliberately studied a species in the tropics and the
comparison between temperate and tropical birds is not a post-hoc decision. However, the reviewer
s right that our study is based on only one species and that a multispecies comparison is necessary
o draw firm conclusion on general tropical/temperate differences. Therefore, we had explicitly
acknowledged the need for multi-species comparisons in the previous version of the manuscript. In
addition, we have now further toned down our wording in the abstract. However, the possibility of
an effect of latitude has far-reaching consequences for the study of bird song and urban ecology, and
aising this issue is, in our eyes, one of the strengths of our study.
Kempenaers et al. (2010 Curr Biol 20, 1735–1739) argue that the lack of light effects in chaffinches is
elated to their timing of the dawn chorus. In their study, species that start singing early in the
morning did show a response to light pollution, whereas late species, such as the chaffinch, did not
see also Da Silva et al. (2014 Beh Ecol 25, 1037-1047)). In comparison with these data, the rufous-
collared sparrow is a very early species, thus one would expect it to shift the dawn song in response
o light pollution if tropical birds behave like temperate ones.
think that the authors underestimated the design of their study. They actually chose their sampling
ites carefully, allowing them to assess the independent as well as combined effects of noise and
ight pollution. Also, as pointed out by Halfwerk & Slabbekoorn, we lack data on covariance between
hese two pollutants. Reporting the covariance levels upfront (not as supplementary material),
eporting the stats on combined effects (not simply mentioning it in methods) would greatly improve
he importance of this paper.
considered. Thus, we reported in the previous version of the manuscript that the two pollutants
were NOT correlated in our study. In the revised text, we have now also adopted the reviewer’s
uggestion to mention the specific values of the interaction between light and noise (line 196).
However, as we already mentioned in the previous submission, this interaction was NOT significant
and thus we didn’t include it in the final model. We are not sure we understand this reviewer’s
uggestion to report “the covariance levels upfront (not as supplementary material)” because we
explicitly mentioned the quantitative correlation measures in the main text. Perhaps the reviewer is
eferring to the corresponding Figure S2 here? We think this figure is better placed in the supplement
but if the editor feels it should be included in the main text, we will, of course, move it there.
The authors also present their results as counter-intuitive to what most people expect. I agree that
he fact of noise pollution on song timing is often ignored, but I also think that the authors somewhat
downplay the results from previous studies. In particular experimental work by Arroyo-Solis et al
deserves more attention. Their study does not 'suggest' that noise effects dawnsong timing, it
demonstrates' it.
Response: We didn’t mean to downplay the contributions of previous studies and therefore we
explicitly mentioned Arroyo-Solis et al.’s work in the introduction as well as the discussion and we
discuss their findings in relation to other previous work and our study. This makes us believe that our
manuscript provides a fair account of the literature, which we regard as a very important part of
cientific publications. Still, we have now extended our reference to Arroyo-Solis et al. (2013) even
more (line 245-247) and we have also changed our wording as suggested by the reviewer.
think the paper would be much stronger by focusing on the underestimated effects of noise on
dawnsong timing and would be cited/referred to more by people working on light pollution.
Response: We have generally put more emphasis on the noise effects in the revised version.
Reviewer 2:
The sample size and sampling design is never made clear, and I think there may be a problem with
he sampling design. There authors draw a focus on their 33 urban sites. They never state when each
ite was visited (this would be a good addition to the supplement, perhaps). But based on my counts
rom Figure 1, the authors visited 18 of the sites in May-June and 15 DIFFERENT sites in November
hrough December. If my understanding is correct this means that different sites were visited in the
wo seasons. (A much more powerful design would have been to visit all the sites in the same season
– preferably the breeding season -- or the same sites in the two different seasons.)…
Response: This comment made us aware that we should have been clearer about the study design.
We now give sample sizes for each subset of the data (line 122) and also mention more clearly the
ampling design (lines 126-137). In addition, we also adopted the reviewer’s suggestion to include in
he supplement when each site was visited (new Figure S3). We fully agree with the reviewer that a
paired design would have been more powerful but since it was unclear whether each site would be
However, we appreciate this comment and we eventually went back to the field November last year
and re-sampled six of the sites that we had visited in May-June. Although the actual sample size is
ower because two sites were not occupied, the results support our findings from the non-paired
comparisons (lines 206-210). We think this new, paired data makes our initial finding even stronger
and we thank the reviewer very much for pointing us in this direction.
…When the authors state “the relationship [between first song and noise level] depended on the
eason”, in fact we don’t know if it was due to the season, or some other un-measured variation
between the sites. Season is confounded by the two different groups of sites. When they state “there
was such a marked seasonal effect”, etc., we don’t know if it is season, or site. In any case, the
ampling design needs to be presented more clearly, including the authors’ motivation for choosing
he sites the way they did, and why they chose those times of year, etc.
Response: The sites we are comparing here are all urban areas of similar structure (public parks and
gardens). Of course we cannot completely rule out that the seasonal effect was biased by some
unmeasured variable. However, we included all factors known to affect the onset of dawn chorus in
our analysis (light, noise, temperature, precipitation). Moreover, the new data gathered last winter
see previous point) supports our initial result, and thanks to the reviewer’s comments, we are now
able to present an even stronger case.
The authors state that the breeding activities of the birds was unknown (line 287). This is
disappointing, because the start of the dawn chorus is widely known to show a strong influence of
breeding stage. Surely some information must be available to know whether birds are breeding in
May-June or November-December? This, by itself, could be the reason for the “marked seasonal
effect” reported in the manuscript. Even if it is through reference to other studies, attempting to
estimate whether the study birds were breeding or not in the two seasons would be a welcome
addition.
Response: We contacted a number of biologists working in Colombia and amateur ornithologists in
Bogota but unfortunately none of them could provide any quantitative data. However, according to
he naturalist Mateo Hernandez fledglings in Bogota are more common in February and June than at
other times of the year. This may hint at breeding peaks in January and May, which would fit with our
data since birds sang earlier in May-June than in November-December. We have added the available
nformation on the timing of breeding to the Introduction (lines 104-106) and discussion (lines 302-
306).
Why did the authors never compare the 5 rural sites to the 33 urban sites? (Or maybe just the 18
urban sites that were measured in May-June, since the rural sites were measured in June.) I would
eally like to know whether there was significant variation in noise levels, light levels, and first song
ime between the 5 urban sites and the 18 or 33 rural sites. Obviously this would have to be a
nonparametric test. If the story about “no effect of light but a strong effect of noise” holds up in the
urban-versus-rural comparison, this would be a compelling addition to the manuscript.
by the reviewer, we compared the urban sites measured in May-June with the rural sites measured
n the same season. Indeed, we found that the urban birds started to sing earlier in the morning than
he rural birds. Rural sites had lower noise as well as lower light levels than the urban ones but this
difference was not statically significant due to the small rural sample size.
A map of the 33 urban sites (and probably the 5 rural sites) would be a good addition to the
manuscript, probably as a supplement. For others to be able to replicate this work, or seek to find
he other factors that are influencing the pattern reported here, they would need to be able to find
he sites.
Response: We have now included a map with the 33 urban sites (Fig. S3).
Another compelling addition to the manuscript would be some spectrograms or power spectra of the
raffic noise at the different sites, as well as some songs of Bogota Rufous-collared Sparrows,
providing the reader with an idea of whether the noise overlaps the frequency range of this species.
Response: Done (Fig. S1).
Stylistic comment
The writing in the Introduction and Discussion needs some more attention and editing. There are
ongwinded sections where the writing is not quite up to journal standards. Example: “Related to
his, dawn singing would emerge earlier in the season through an earlier entry into the reproductive
tage in areas with artificial light at night. However, in addition light also directly influences the onset
ime of dawn chorus in the morning.” Also, there are sections that are quite repetitive. Also, there
could be more done to keep each paragraph focused on a specific topic.
Response: We have thoroughly edited the manuscript, including proof-reading by two native English
peakers.
Other significant points
Line 165-168: The authors state HOW they tested for normality, but never actually report whether
heir data were normal.
Response: The data were normally distributed (line 166).
Lines 185-186: The authors could explain how these ranges of light levels and noise levels correspond
o descriptive terms, so that the reader can relate to these results. Does 9.4 lux correspond to a
bright parking lot, or a single lightbulb? Does 75 dB correspond to a busy multi-lane highway, or a
quiet side street?
of light and noise pollution. (9 lux corresponds to a bicycle light at 10 m distance and 75 dB(A) to a
very busy road. However, it is difficult to pinpoint these values because the noise levels depend on
he type of cars, their speed, the road surface etc.)
Line 266 and elsewhere: Be careful about the language of “started singing later” versus “started
inging later relative to sunrise”. It is worthwhile to continue to recognize that the times are relative
o sunrise.
Response: We have changed our wording in line 266. However, we did not change this throughout
he manuscript because the phrase “started singing later relative to sunrise” is a bit cumbersome and
makes the text difficult to read. Anyway, sunrise times in our study area varied by only about 20
minutes over the course of the year, which is smaller than observed differences in dawn song times.
Therefore, the wording “started singing earlier” is not incorrect.
Line 286: The authors state that there was no meteorological differences between the two sampling
easons, and make reference (#41) to a weather website. A weather website! I guess the author is
upposed to look up the weather data for the two study periods and run their own analyses? But
when I visit the website (eltiempo.net), I see that it doesn’t even contain historical weather data,
only this week’s weather forecast (not weather data, but a forecast). This isn’t very impressive.
Response: We apologize for this mistake. When we organized the references different websites got
mixed up. Of course, we used the weather data from a meteorological data base. We rectified this
embarrassing slip in the revised version.
Other small points
Line 107: I don’t think this species comes into the North Temperate zone.
Response: We clarified this in the revised manuscript.
Line 109: State the distance to the equator. (And elsewhere, I think you should report the variation in
day length over the course of the year.)
Response: We clarified this in the manuscript (lines 120-121)
Line 139: If correct, be straightforward in saying that one site was visited per day.
Response: Up to three people collected data on the same day, therefore several sites were visited on
certain days.
Line 159: What type of sunset? Nautical?
Response: Dawn song onset was measured in relation to sunrise (i.e. end of civil twighlight).
Line 153: How did you choose peak traffic hours? What data supports the notion that these are peak
hours?
Response: We choose peak hours based on traffic census by the city authorities (Secretaria Distrital
de Mobilidad of Bogota). We clarified this in the manuscript (line 154-155).
The review I was sent includes two earlier reviews of this manuscript that appear to be for
Proceedings B, and the responses of the authors to the reviewers. I’m not sure if was an expectation
hat I would comment on this aspect of the manuscript or not. I would point out that the authors
haven’t taken the original two reviewers’ brief suggestions very carefully.
Example: Reviewer 1 asked you to please specify more details about the site selection, but your new
ine at 124-127 doesn’t do an adequate job of this (all you say in these new sentences is that you
chose 33 sites to show a range of noise and light pollution levels, and it doesn’t mention the rural
ites).
Response: We mentioned that we choose five rural sites but since the emphasis of our study is the
within-city comparison (similar to previous published papers), we mainly focused on the urban sites.
n the revised manuscript we have now included more details about the rural sites.
Example: Reviewer 2 asked for the distance between sites, including rural sites, but the authors have
not provided this information. (It was a good idea.)
Response: We have included distances between all sites in lines 135 and 137.

Both of the previous reviewers have commented on this new version, and, based on
their reponses, I think you've done a good job. Some small revisions are required
however before this can be accepted. Could you have a look at the comments from
reviewer #2 and respond to them. At the same time, please could you refer to
figures S1 and S2 in the text - these currently are not mentioned anywhere in the
main body of the manuscript.
Response: We now refer to the figures S1 and S2 in the main text.
