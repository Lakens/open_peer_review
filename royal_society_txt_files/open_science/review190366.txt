Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
In this work, Wang and colleagues present an ordinary based equation system to investigate the
relationship between the tumor response to checkpoint blockade therapy and antigen intensity,
including their individual and combined effects on the immune system.
The work is well written and the results are clearly presented. All the equations are presented
and one can be able to reproduce the work.
On the other hand, there are some critical points that need to be addressed before the manuscript
is acceptable for publications.
Major points:
1) Authors failed to discuss other methodologies that were adopted to model the complex
immune system behaviour both alone and in response to induced artificial immunity. There are a
lot of these examples, especially in tumor immunology.
Some are based on agent based modeling approaches. Others are based on complex differential
equation systems, also based on enzymatic kinetics.
See for example:
*) Induction of T cell memory by a dendritic cell vaccine: a computational model. Bioinformatics,
30(13):1884–1891, 2014. (doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu059)
*) A Dynamic Model of Immune Responses to Antigen Presentation Predicts Different Regions of
Tumor or Pathogen Elimination, Cell Systems, Volume 4, Issue 2, 2017, 231-241.
doi:10.1016/j.cels.2016.12.003
*) In silico modeling and in vivo efficacy of cancer-preventive vaccinations. Cancer Research,
70(20):7755–7763, 2010. (doi:10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0701)
*) Computational modeling reveals MAP3K8 as mediator of resistance to vemurafenib in thyroid
cancer stem cells. Bioinformatics, 2018. (doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty969)
It is useful if the authors add to the discussion session a paragraph or two reviewing these
important works in the field.
2) Authors failed to discuss the advantage and the disadvantages of their methodology. ODE
systems are good when dealing with populations. But they fail to address important aspects
when immune system is modelled. For example, specificity and immune system repertoire are
not taken into account. Moreover, different types of lymphocytes subpopulation are not
considered at all. See for example CD4(Th1, Th2, Th17), CD8.
Authors should mention these in the discussion session.

acknowledgements.
We suggest the following format:
AB carried out the molecular lab work, participated in data analysis, carried out sequence

publication.
• Acknowledgements
Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship
criteria.

Please list the source of funding for each author.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.

ponse to Reviewer 1:
thank the reviewer for the review of our paper and constructive comments. We have answered each
t below.
uthors failed to discuss other methodologies that were adopted to model the complex immune system
aviour both alone and in response to induced artificial immunity. There are a lot of these examples,
ecially in tumor immunology.
e are based on agent based modeling approaches. Others are based on complex differential
ation systems, also based on enzymatic kinetics.

cells. Bioinformatics, 2018. (doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty969)
useful if the authors add to the discussion session a paragraph or two reviewing these important
ks in the field.
ponse: We added a paragraph regarding the other model types in tumor immunology, including the
gested examples, and their potential applications in the Discussion section (please see the last
graph in Discussion, page 13).
uthors failed to discuss the advantage and the disadvantages of their methodology. ODE systems are
d when dealing with populations. But they fail to address important aspects when immune system is
elled. For example, specificity and immune system repertoire are not taken into account. Moreover,
rent types of lymphocytes subpopulation are not considered at all. See for example CD4(Th1, Th2,
7), CD8. Authors should mention these in the discussion session.
ponse: The limitations of ODE-based models are also added to the last paragraph in the Discussion
ion. Although we tried to capture the heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment by adding tumor
cies expressing different types of checkpoint ligands and receptors, the modeling of spatial distribution
the immune repertoire may require other approaches such as agent-based modeling. Also for
plicity, only the major species of interest are included in the current model (please see the last
graph in the Discussion, page 13).
