The manuscript by Brosset et al. aims at exploring reproductive trade-offs in a Mediterranean
population of two species of small pelagic fish. The topic is scientifically relevant and potentially
important from the point of view of managing species subject to intense fishing pressure. The
conclusions however are questionable because of the heterogeneous nature of the datasets and
the statistical treatment of some of the variables. Moreover the manuscript would require a
thorough review of structure and style for it to be appropriate for a general journal like Royal
Society Open Science. In particular, the introduction concentrates on “small pelagic fish” too
early (line 63), some of the methods are not properly justified, the results are mainly descriptive
(specific testing of some of the hypotheses presented is missing) and the discussion is too long
and requires focus.
A serious problem throughout the manuscript is the use of non-validated indices to normalize
data and correct for differences in body size. For example the gonadosomatic index (GSI) and
relative batch fecundity (RBF) are both presented as size-free variables simply because they
include eviscerated weight in the denominator. However, dividing by a proxy of body size
results in a new variable that can be still related to fish size, positively or negatively depending
on the kind of allometry. Unless the authors validate the ratio, i.e. show that the relationship
between gonad weight (or batch fecundity) and eviscerated weight is isometric (linear and with
an intercept of 0), the interpretation of the results is misleading. I strongly recommend the
authors to read the classic papers on the issue by Packard and Boardman (1988 The misuse of
ratios, indices, and percentages in ecophysiological research. Physiological Zoology 61[1]: 1-9,
and 1999 The use of percentages and size-specific indices to normalize physiological data for
variation in body size: wasted time, wasted effort? Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology
Part A 122: 37–44). Also Tomkins & Simmons (2002, Measuring relative investment: a case study
of testes investment in species with alternative male reproductive tactics. Animal Behaviour
63[5]: 1009-1016) explore the same issue in the context of reproductive allotment. I understand
that GSI and RBF have been traditionally used in fishery science, but that is not enough
justification to ignore the mathematical properties of the rations and their inability to remove the
effects of body size in many cases. I encourage the authors to try to validate their indices, and if
the relationships are not allometric, then use appropriate alternatives such as residuals or general
linear models (see also García-Berthou 2001 On the misuse of residuals in ecology: testing
regression residuals vs. the analysis of covariance. Journal of Animal Ecology 70: 708–711).
A smaller problem is the comparison between anchovy and sardine in their response to
environmental change (including climate and fishing pressure). When comparing two species, the
null hypothesis must be that they are different just because they are taxonomically different. A
very good analysis on this issue can be found in Garland & Adolph (1994 Why not to do two-
species comparative studies: limitations on inferring adaptation. Physiological Zoology 67[4]:
797-828).

label_comment_2
Overall this is an interesting study that is worth being published in your journal. It deals with
energetic trade-offs between growth and reproduction in two commonly studied small pelagics,
the populations of anchovy and sardine in the Gulf of Lions. Despite the huge amount of papers
on the spawning dynamics of the two species the authors managed to propose some novel
correlations between somatic reserves and reproductive potential such as the positive
relationship between body lipid content and hydrated oocytes dry mass. My major concern is
about the main working hypothesis of this paper. The whole story is centered on findings from a
recent paper that the somatic condition of both species has dramatically declined from 2008
onwards. Based on this finding the authors consider the observed changes in the reproductive
potential of both species (decrease in Lm, increase in gonad mass and duration of spawning
season) as a response to environmentally driven decrease in body condition. In my opinion the
scientific value of this paper would be preserved if it did not depend so much on the findings of
these 1-2 recent papers. For example, Van Beveren et al. (2014) show that beyond 2008 and apart
from somatic condition there is also decrease in body size for both species. But somatic indices
are known to be biased and much dependent on somatic growth. On the other hand, there are
only a few mentions that the observed shifts in reproductive potential could be linked to
increased adult mortality rates, e.g. fishing mortality (e.g. Page 16, lines 394-396 and Page 17 lines
4
419-421). In addition, I would be more cautious about linking the results of this study to the
income vs. capital breeding strategies (some sardine populations were shown to feed during the
spawning period while some anchovies rely part of their reproduction on somatic reserves) and
to the BIG recruitment theories such as the match-mismatch hypothesis.
- The authors need to better explain temporal groupings of their data, e.g. in figure-2
- In Figure 2, actively spawning fish, i.e. females at migratory nucleus or hydration stages, reach
very high fractions, ~100% for the anchovy and >75% for sardine. This practically means that at
the spawning peak anchovies spawn every day while sardines either every day or every other
day. But this is in contrast to previous spawning fraction estimates (used also from the authors in
their total egg production estimates)

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The manuscript presents novel and relevant information about the biology of anchovy and
sardine in the GoL, a region where these species are highly exploited and thus much data are
needed in order to improve the management of their fisheries.
The analyses performed in this study are adequate, and the results obtained are, in general, well
explained.
The manuscript overall is of high scientific quality and deserves to be considered for publication.
However, in my view some major concerns should be addressed before it can be published.
I have doubts about the methodology employed in the analysis of the samples from the 1970s.
This should be clearer specified in the manuscript.
5
In addition, given the high variability of the data from those years (1970s), perhaps due to the
analytical methods used, I do not understand why the information that there data reveal are of
interest in this study. The conclusions would likely have been the same without including these
"old" data. My suggestion, since they appear to me to be unnecessary, is to disregard them and
take them out of this manuscript.
My main concern is related to the conclusions that the authors extract from their results. I do not
think that some of those conclusions can be reached with the information they provide in the
manuscript. Please, read through my comment for further details in this issue, and rewrite the
Discussion in a less speculative, more sounded, manner. See Appendix A.

Comments to the Author:
The three reviewers have made a number of recommendations for improvement of the
manuscript that are required prior to further consideration for publication. These
recommendations are centred on two main areas. Firstly, there is the writing style and
organisation, which needs to be improved in order to provide better context and interpretation of
the research and data. The reviewers have made a number of points that should help with
changing the text in order to accommodate these suggestions. Secondly, all reviewers make
recommendations for changes and improvements to the analyses.
Finally, a number of suggestions are made for improvements to the written English by one of the
reviewers. The authors should make every effort to incorporate these suggestions and edit the
entire manuscript in a similar vein.

Thank you for taking the comments seriously and reviewing the manuscript accordingly. The
attempt to validate the indices is great and reveals the real problems of using traditional metrics
uncritically. The graphs provided by stages in your response suggest very biased residuals, have
you checked the normality of those residuals? some of them do not seem to be normally
distrbuted, in some cases they are related to the x variable, in others the positive residuals are
typically larger than the negative ones, which could be easily fixed using a log transformed Y

accepting methodologies from the time when modern computing techniques were unavailable.

6. “prevent individuals from”
-27. Although I understand what the authors want to say here in the context of the trade-offs
ized in this work, I believe the statement is not completely accurate. Limited resources do not
essarily always result in trade-offs, as there might be organisms that will follow a strategy in which
can optimize all their inter-related traits just in a very reduced manner, instead of giving up one or
e of the trait developments. Concurrently, it is precisely the limitation of resources what might
ger, in some cases, the optimization of all history traits in order for the individual to increase its
ess. Also, trade-offs are not always a result of environmental changes or limited resources; in fact,
etimes, even when food/energy is abundant, a trade-off is produced by a metabolic constraint or a
avioral adaptation (ex. When mating time arrives, and thus increases the energy requirements, the
vidual might decide to relocate some of the energy that would otherwise have been used for
wth/maintenance into reproduction, instead of spending more time feeding, simply because of the
s of searching for food, and/or because that way they can dedicate more time to reproduction during
season). I would suggest to modify the start of the Abstract, as this sentence somehow defines the
of this research. Same in Lines 53-54.

d shortage; however, that is a very speculative statement, and other possibilities, such as fisheries
sure, should be considered and discussed as well.

Comments to the Author:
The three reviewers have made a number of recommendations for improvement of the manuscript
hat are required prior to further consideration for publication. These recommendations are centred
on two main areas. Firstly, there is the writing style and organisation, which needs to be improved in
order to provide better context and interpretation of the research and data. The reviewers have
made a number of points that should help with changing the text in order to accommodate these
uggestions. Secondly, all reviewers make recommendations for changes and improvements to the
analyses.
Finally, a number of suggestions are made for improvements to the written English by one of the
eviewers. The authors should make every effort to incorporate these suggestions and edit the entire
manuscript in a similar vein.
REPLY: We wish to thank you, the three reviewers as well as the editorial staff, for your many helpful
comments and suggestions. According to these recommendations, the manuscript has been deeply
evised and, we believe, substantially improved.
Overall, we followed the recommendations to reorganize the manuscript, improve the writing style,
make it less descriptive and improve the quality of the discussion about reproductive performances
n the light of reviewer’s comments. We also performed new analyses as suggested by the referees
and validated the use of ratios such as gonadosomatic index and relative batch fecundity. The lack of
esting for potential fisheries effects underlined by two of the referees has now been clarified.
Recommendations not to compare the two species as well as to be cautious about linking the results
of this study to reproductive strategies have been followed. Detailed responses to the specific
eviewers’ queries are available below, and changes brought to the manuscript reported accordingly.
Note that line numbers reported in our answer correspond to lines in the revised manuscript with all
changes accepted.
We hope that the manuscript is now suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science and look
orward to hearing from you soon.
Yours sincerely,
Pablo Brosset, on behalf of all co-authors.
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
<U+F0B7> The manuscript by Brosset et al. aims at exploring reproductive trade-offs in a
Mediterranean population of two species of small pelagic fish. The topic is scientifically
relevant and potentially important from the point of view of managing species subject to
intense fishing pressure. The conclusions however are questionable because of the
heterogeneous nature of the datasets and the statistical treatment of some of the variables.
Moreover the manuscript would require a thorough review of structure and style for it to be
appropriate for a general journal like Royal Society Open Science. In particular, the
introduction concentrates on “small pelagic fish” too early (line 63), some of the methods are
not properly justified, the results are mainly descriptive (specific testing of some of the
hypotheses presented is missing) and the discussion is too long and requires focus.
REPLY: We are grateful to the referee for pointing out the relevance and importance of this
manuscript. Concerning the heterogeneous aspect of the data, we would like to underline that
despite the different sampling methods (trawling and scientific surveys) and years, the same
methodologies were applied to all samples and similar material used regardless the period or
ampling method. This has now been made clearer in the text (lines 131-136). Regarding the
tatistical aspect, please read the specific reply below.
According to the comments of all referees, we restructured and rewrote a large part of the
manuscript to better fit with Royal Society Open Science standards. The comment on the fact that we
concentrate on small pelagic fish too early in the introduction contrasts with referee 3’s comment,
who asks us to focus directly on small pelagic fish. As the Royal Society Open Science journal has a
arge readership and scope, we decided to follow the comment made by referee 1. We now start by
etting the broad ecological context in more details before introducing small pelagic fish later in the
ntroduction (see now line 62 and 84). We have also now properly justified methods and rewritten
esults to be less descriptive. The discussion was also shortened and focused on the aspects
upported by results in order to be less speculative (see all the changes in the updated manuscript).
<U+F0B7> A serious problem throughout the manuscript is the use of non-validated indices to
normalize data and correct for differences in body size. For example the gonadosomatic
index (GSI) and relative batch fecundity (RBF) are both presented as size-free variables simply
because they include eviscerated weight in the denominator. However, dividing by a proxy of
body size results in a new variable that can be still related to fish size, positively or negatively
depending on the kind of allometry. Unless the authors validate the ratio, i.e. show that the
relationship between gonad weight (or batch fecundity) and eviscerated weight is isometric
(linear and with an intercept of 0), the interpretation of the results is misleading. I strongly
recommend the authors to read the classic papers on the issue by Packard and Boardman
(1988 The misuse of ratios, indices, and percentages in ecophysiological research.
Physiological Zoology 61[1]: 1-9, and 1999 The use of percentages and size-specific indices to
normalize physiological data for variation in body size: wasted time, wasted effort?
Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A 122: 37–44). Also Tomkins & Simmons
(2002, Measuring relative investment: a case study of testes investment in species with
alternative male reproductive tactics. Animal Behaviour 63[5]: 1009-1016) explore the same
issue in the context of reproductive allotment. I understand that GSI and RBF have been
traditionally used in fishery science, but that is not enough justification to ignore the
mathematical properties of the rations and their inability to remove the effects of body size
in many cases. I encourage the authors to try to validate their indices, and if the relationships
models (see also García-Berthou 2001 On the misuse of residuals in ecology: testing
regression residuals vs. the analysis of covariance. Journal of Animal Ecology 70: 708–711).
REPLY: We read the interesting references given by the referee to have a complete idea of the
debate about ratio indices. First, we wanted to highlight that GSI and Relative Batch Fecundity are
not directly divided by the size, but with the body mass, which should be better in removing size
effect according to allometric equations. Further, as stated by the referee, GSI and RBF have been
raditionally used in fishery science, which makes these ratios helpful for comparison purposes. Yet,
we agree with the statement that this is not enough justification to ignore the mathematical
properties of the ratios and their inability to remove the effects of body size in some cases. Thus, as
equested by the referee, we investigated the relationship between gonad weight and eviscerated
weight. To do so, we studied the relationship by gonad development stage, i.e. doing one linear
model by stage (Fig. 1 of this document). We excluded stage 1, corresponding to immature individual
without visible gonads and stage 6 when gonad are empty after spawning. We obtained significant
inear relationship with an intercept of 0 for each stage (see figure and stats in the following page),
validating the use of the GSI ratio.
L167: “The use of this index was validated by confirming the isometric relationship between gonad
weight and fish eviscerated weight, preventing us to misleading interpretation.”
Regarding RBF, same test was realized, i.e. the batch fecundity in function to eviscerated weight and
ame results were obtained (see stats in the following page).
L237: “and was formerly validated following the same procedure than for the GSI.”
We also did further investigations to better answer to the referee question and see if we obtain same
esults by using GSI or residuals. Results obtained with residuals coming from nonlinear fitting of
gonad weight in function to fish size led to same results and conclusions that the use of the GSI (Fig.
2 of this document). Therefore, we think it would be better to keep these indices, which have been
commonly used and tested in fishery science, rather to uses residuals. This will allow other authors
an easier comparison of these traditional indices in future works.

<U+F0B7> A smaller problem is the comparison between anchovy and sardine in their response to
environmental change (including climate and fishing pressure). When comparing two
species, the null hypothesis must be that they are different just because they are
taxonomically different. A very good analysis on this issue can be found in Garland & Adolph
(1994 Why not to do two-species comparative studies: limitations on inferring adaptation.
Physiological Zoology 67[4]: 797-828).
REPLY: Thanks again for this useful reference. We agree with the referee and have read this really
nteresting reference. In our study, it is true that we investigated in details the reproductive
performances of two species. Both are planktivorous fish, co-occurring in the same environment, but
we do not really want to compare them in the results section as they are two different species, but
ust discuss (in the discussion section) some of the differences found (especially according to their
eproductive strategy). Thus, no comparison tests are conducted, as we are indeed aware that these
wo species are different in their response to environmental changes. Moreover, corrections made
along the text according to different referee comments have helped to better discriminate anchovy
and sardine results, preventing us to establish spurious comparisons between the two species.
Minor points
included, not all the readers know where that is.
REPLY: We apologize for the vagueness of the location. We added precision.
L90: “in the Gulf of Lions (NorthWestern Mediterranean Sea)”
<U+F0B7> Line 131 how where the fish *randomly* selected?
REPLY: We added precision to the sampling strategy.
L131: “Samples were randomly collected in trawls of scientific surveys (PELMED & MEDITS, from 2003
onwards) by successively dividing the total anchovy catch until the quantity necessary to analyses was
eached or obtain from commercial trawlers operating in the Gulf of Lions during all years.”
<U+F0B7> Lines 252-3 a reference is required here, overwinter mortality is a significant aspect of the
life history of most fish species, even in those with massive early life history mortalities.
REPLY: We apologize for not having explained our method accurately. We are only adding growth
between summer and next winter, i.e. 6 months, so fish do not overwinter during this period. This
hould minimize the effect of mortality. We have now added this information more precisely.
Furthermore, this overwinter mortality is mostly for species such as cod inhabiting colder
oceans where the long and cold winter often translates into a stressful period (temperature and lack
of sufficient food), rather than for anchovies and sardine inhabiting temperate waters of the
Mediterranean (Lloret et al., 2014).
L261: “Adult mortality was assumed to be size independent between summer and the beginning of
winter, as mortality was assumed to occur mostly in the first weeks of life or during overwintering.”
<U+F0B7> Line 374 is *adaptation* the right word here? Does it mean from an evolutionary point of
view? Involving changes in gene frequencies or just physiological adjustments (i.e.
phenotypically plastic)?
REPLY: We thank the reviewer to underline this mistake and now use “adjustments” to avoid any
confusion.
L386: “These changes could be the result of physiological adjustments to increasing sea temperatures
and changing environment.”
<U+F0B7> Line 400 is *try* the right word? It seems to suggest conscious intent.
REPLY: The referee is right, this word can be ambiguous in this case. We modified it by “seem to”.
L421: “By devoting more energy per individual to reproduction, small pelagic fish seem to favour their
eproductive output over somatic growth under unfavorable conditions”
<U+F0B7> Line 410 why is Stearns 1989 not in the same format as the rest of references? i.e. [3]
REPLY: We apologize for this typo error. This is now corrected.
<U+F0B7> Fig 1 is this necessary?
REPLY: We think that this figure helps the reader to better differentiate the different samples used in
his study. According to us, we prefer to keep this figure. However, if RSOS editors think that it is
uperficial, we will remove it.
<U+F0B7> Fig 6 just a visual assessment of the distribution of residuals indicates that these relationships
are not linear.
REPLY: The reviewer is right, but we also tested different nonlinear relationships (power and Weibull
models) and that did not improve significantly the percentage of deviance explained. This is why we
kept the simplest model in our first version. We did again the analysis and same conclusion
appeared.
Comments to the Author(s)
Overall this is an interesting study that is worth being published in your journal. It deals with
energetic trade-offs between growth and reproduction in two commonly studied small pelagics, the
populations of anchovy and sardine in the Gulf of Lions. Despite the huge amount of papers on the
pawning dynamics of the two species the authors managed to propose some novel correlations
between somatic reserves and reproductive potential such as the positive relationship between body
ipid content and hydrated oocytes dry mass. My major concern is about the main working
hypothesis of this paper. The whole story is centered on findings from a recent paper that the
omatic condition of both species has dramatically declined from 2008 onwards. Based on this
inding the authors consider the observed changes in the reproductive potential of both species
decrease in Lm, increase in gonad mass and duration of spawning season) as a response to
environmentally driven decrease in body condition. In my opinion the scientific value of this paper
would be preserved if it did not depend so much on the findings of these 1-2 recent papers. For
example, Van Beveren et al. (2014) show that beyond 2008 and apart from somatic condition there is
also decrease in body size for both species. But somatic indices are known to be biased and much
dependent on somatic growth. On the other hand, there are only a few mentions that the observed
hifts in reproductive potential could be linked to increased adult mortality rates, e.g. fishing
mortality (e.g. Page 16, lines 394-396 and Page 17 lines 419-421). In addition, I would be more
cautious about linking the results of this study to the income vs. capital breeding strategies (some
ardine populations were shown to feed during the spawning period while some anchovies rely part
of their reproduction on somatic reserves) and to the BIG recruitment theories such as the match-
mismatch hypothesis.
GENERAL REPLY:
We thank the reviewer to underline the interesting and novel aspect of our manuscript. We now try
o clarify the concerns expressed by the referee.
While the literature on small pelagic fish in the Mediterranean is rich, the paper from Van Beveren et
al., 2014, was the first to study small pelagic fish population dynamics in the Gulf of Lions and was
he beginning of a project to improve the knowledge on small pelagic fish in this area. This paper
combined all available data in order to describe the situation of the small pelagic fish in the Gulf of
Lions and set the main potential hypotheses to explain the observed changes. A number of studies
has then followed in order to test for these different hypotheses. As a consequence, we referred a lot
o this paper. Yet, a second paper focused on body condition confirmed the decrease first observed
by Van Beveren and colleagues (see Brosset et al.2015). By testing the hypothesis behind the results
presented by Van Beveren et al, our paper aims to evaluate and provide an explaination of the
mportant changes suffered by the small pelagic populations in the Gulf of Lions. Further, none of our
analyses in this new paper rely on results previously obtained. Regarding somatic indices and their
potential size dependence (i.e. the link with somatic growth), we understand the concern of the
eferee, but we do not think it applies to any of the indices used here. Indeed, the morphometric
ndex used in the paper (as in Van Beveren et al., 2014 or Brosset et al 2015) is the Le Cren’s relative
condition factor. This factor is independent of length as stated in Lloret et al., (2014) or Froese
2006). Indeed, it measures the deviation of an individual from the average weight for length in the
espective sample and is estimated using residuals so that body condition is totally size-independent.
n summary, many studies on different species have confirmed the ability of this approach to
compare the condition of fish; e.g. cod, Pardoe et al. (2008) or ell, Durif et al. ( 2006). Further, we
have now validated the use of other indices used here such as GSI or RBF in order to demonstrate
hat they are not dependent on length (see please the detailed explanation and calculations we did,
which appear in the answers to referee 1).
We apologize fully acknowledge the importance of fishing in the first draft of the manuscript. These
wo species are indeed extremely important commercial species, but although they are very
exploited, they appear not to be overexploited in the Gulf of Lions, especially in recent years (FAO,
2016). A recent study from Van Beveren et al. (2016) investigated fishing pressure and underlined
hat the maximum rate of exploitation during some years was around ~20% of the abundance of
both populations, which cannot be defined as overexploitation. Moreover, this study highlighted that
ishing pressure on small pelagic fish was really weak during the last decade, when changes in size-at-
maturity, GSI, and body condition occurred. This is why we did not test for an effect of fisheries
pressure, on the variables. Still, as different parameters could have acted in synergy, we added two
entences on the fishery pressure to have a discussion as complete as possible.
L413: “…as well as fishing pressure. As [74] underlined the relatively low exploitation of both species
during study period in the study area, we do not think that fishing could be the main factor that has
nduced the observed changes in the studied indices. However, fishing can act as a co-variable, and its
mpact might be difficult to differentiate to environmental ones. Fishing activities can largely affect
he condition and reproductive potential of exploited fish in complex ways such as reducing the food
availability or inducing physiological stress (reviewed by [15]) and therefore we cannot fully discard
hat fishing activities in the area targeting anchovy and sardine, despite being moderate, can play a
ole on the observed changes. Therefore, further investigations are needed to consider the fishing
pressure on the condition and reproductive potential of small pelagic fish populations.”
The last point recommended us to be cautious about linking the results of this study both to the
different reproductive strategies and the match-mismatch hypothesis. We agree with the referee
and have now removed the sentence about match-mismatch hypothesis which was too speculative.
The sentence related to reproductive strategies was also modified as follow:
L446: ”Nevertheless, some sardine populations were shown to feed during spawning period while
ome anchovies rely on somatic reserves for part of their reproduction [42], smoothing off the income
vs. capital strategy opposition. Even if strict income or capital strategy might not happen all the time
n the Gulf of Lions, our results still suggest potential differences in the effect of reproductive
nvestment on other life-history traits depending on breeding strategies (income/capital), which
would merit further investigation.”
Specific comments:
<U+F0B7> The authors need to better explain temporal groupings of their data, e.g. in figure-2
REPLY: We thank the referee to underline this point. Temporal grouping of data was made according
o period of successive years to obtain enough data to be representative of annual reproductive cycle
as already explained in the manuscript. To go in deeper details, we gathered years in two groups of
ame number of data, as this allowed obtaining enough data in each period. We also gathered years
n two successive periods to take into account the progressive changes highlighted in other study
Van Beveren et al., 2014; Brosset et al., 2015, this study) to avoid mixing years from different
periods that could prevent us from detecting any signal. We have added a sentence in the
manuscript to make it clearer as requested by the referee. We also improved explanation about
emporal groupings of data throughout the entire manuscript (please see the corrected version).
equal time periods (2008-2011 and 2012-2015) to increase sample sizes and representativeness (n =
50 in any given month). These breeding cycles were then compared to previously published data from
1965 [46]. Additionally, data on the mean breeding stage of sardines collected in 1959 (Lee 1961)
were also used for comparative purposes.”
<U+F0B7> In Figure 2, actively spawning fish, i.e. females at migratory nucleus or hydration stages,
reach very high fractions, ~100% for the anchovy and >75% for sardine. This practically
means that at the spawning peak anchovies spawn every day while sardines either every day
or every other day. But this is in contrast to previous spawning fraction estimates (used also
from the authors in their total egg production estimates)
REPLY: This actually contrasts with previous findings, but we think that the determining of batch
requency cannot be done with gonads classified with visual inspection. Indeed, the fifth stage group
ish with hydrated oocytes but also oocytes that are not yet hydrated. We underline that we used
CES 2008 6-stages keys (visual assessment) here and not the Brown-Peterson key which is based on
histological analyses (which were not done before 2014). So in this stage 5 of ICES key, not all
ndividuals are spawning, and it is impossible to determine spawning frequency with this type of
data. Indeed, spawning frequency in iteroparous fishes expresses the number of spawning events per
unit time, usually per day. Spawning frequency can be estimated either as an individual parameter
hrough interspawning interval, ISI, i.e. the time lag between subsequent spawning events, or as a
population parameter through the spawning fraction, S, i.e. the proportion of females spawning per
day (Ganias et al., 2014). Spawning fraction is usually estimated by the proportion per sample of
mature females with post-ovulatory follicles (POFs) pertaining to an identifiable daily spawning
cohort. Alternatively, S can also be obtained from the proportion of imminent pre-spawning females,
as detected by the presence of ovaries undergoing oocyte maturation (OM). The requisite to
estimate S is to be able to identify daily spawning classes (or cohorts) from gonadal histological
ndicators of imminent or recent spawning activity (Ganias et al., 2014). This is why this could seem
eally different from other studies, which all used histological analyses. This is also why we did not
nfer spawning frequency from this data but rather from the literature for our total egg production
estimations.
However, the referee pointed out that we are unclear on this part. To correct this point, we modified
he figure y-axis with ‘Spawning capable individuals’ and we clarified when we used the different
gonad classification keys (please see line 140 and 153 and the reply to the similar comment of the
hird referee).
Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript presents novel and relevant information about the biology of anchovy and sardine in
he GoL, a region where these species are highly exploited and thus much data are needed in order
o improve the management of their fisheries.
The analyses performed in this study are adequate, and the results obtained are, in general, well
explained.
The manuscript overall is of high scientific quality and deserves to be considered for publication.
However, in my view some major concerns should be addressed before it can be published.
have doubts about the methodology employed in the analysis of the samples from the 1970s. This
hould be clearer specified in the manuscript.
n addition, given the high variability of the data from those years (1970s), perhaps due to the
analytical methods used, I do not understand why the information that there data reveal are of
nterest in this study. The conclusions would likely have been the same without including these "old"
data. My suggestion, since they appear to me to be unnecessary, is to disregard them and take them
out of this manuscript.
My main concern is related to the conclusions that the authors extract from their results. I do not
hink that some of those conclusions can be reached with the information they provide in the
manuscript. Please, read through my comment for further details in this issue, and rewrite the
Discussion in a less speculative, more sounded, manner.
GENERAL REPLY: We want to thank the reviewer to positively receive our work. We understand that
we need to clarify when samples were used. As answered in minor comments, samples from the
1970s were used only to compute morphometric indices (GSI index, gonad weight, etc.) and not for
histological analyses. The same methodology (length and weight measurements) was applied at the
ime for these samples as for those of more recent years and we do not see why they would be less
eliable. We have now specified it in the manuscript, as you will see in the reply this specific minor
comment. Same methodology was followed in the different periods, making comparisons for all the
different analyses robust.
Although they are not the core of the study, we think that these data need to remain in the
manuscript, first because they improve the robustness of conclusions by providing some sort of
baseline and second as they had never been published before and could serve as reference points to
other studies.
We thank the reviewer for providing several specific comments to improve discussion and conclusion
see minor comments) and have amended the text according to most of his suggestions. Briefly, we
have shortened paragraphs that were too long and rewritten a big part of the discussion to make it
easier to read and clearer. Thanks to the referee comments, we also paid attention to make
conclusions less speculative, based mainly on this study results.
Please, see below the replies to the specific comments.
Abstract
<U+F0B7> L. 26. “prevent individuals from”
REPLY: The referee is right, we corrected the word ‘to’ into ‘from’.
L26: “prevent individuals from simultaneously maximising all life history traits”
<U+F0B7> L.26-27. Although I understand what the authors want to say here in the context of the
trade-offs analized in this work, I believe the statement is not completely accurate. Limited
resources do not necessarily always result in trade-offs, as there might be organisms that will
follow a strategy in which they can optimize all their inter-related traits just in a very reduced
manner, instead of giving up one or some of the trait developments. Concurrently, it is
precisely the limitation of resources what might trigger, in some cases, the optimization of all
history traits in order for the individual to increase its fitness. Also, trade-offs are not always
a result of environmental changes or limited resources; in fact, sometimes, even when
food/energy is abundant, a trade-off is produced by a metabolic constraint or a behavioral
adaptation (ex. When mating time arrives, and thus increases the energy requirements, the
individual might decide to relocate some of the energy that would otherwise have been used
for growth/maintenance into reproduction, instead of spending more time feeding, simply
because of the risks of searching for food, and/or because that way they can dedicate more
time to reproduction during that season). I would suggest to modify the start of the Abstract,
as this sentence somehow defines the core of this research. Same in Lines 53-54.
REPLY: We agree with the referee comment, because trade-offs are not always due to limited
esources, but can also depend on other potential constraints (e.g. physiological or metabolical
constraints). As we focused on a situation of food-shortage, we made the error to talk only about
imited resources. This comment is also interesting because by talking about other constraints, we
enlarge the scope of our manuscript. We corrected in the abstract by just modifying the word
optimize’ by ‘maximizing’ (see line 26) which is more accurate, but we completely changes the line
53-54 in the introduction (‘Reproduction and maintenance require important and often conflicting
energy investments in all animal species [1,2]. Further, additional constraints such as limited
esources or physiological constraints might also limit the energy available to be allocated, preventing
imultaneous maximization of all life-history traits and bringing out trade-offs [3,4].’, see now line 52-
54).
<U+F0B7> L.36. What do you mean with the opposite for egg quality? Negatively linked to fish size and
positively to lipid reserves? Or linked to lipid reserves but not to fish size? Please explain.
REPLY: The referee required precisions. With this sentence, we meant that egg quality is linked to
ipid reserves but not fish size. We clarified it.
L36: “while the egg quality was positively related to lipid reserves”
<U+F0B7> L.40-41. A more interesting question here would be whether fish can actually maintain a high
eproductive output, and that is in fact discussed in the discussion section, thus it would be worth
mentioning it at least in the Introduction.
REPLY: The referee highlighted something missing in the introduction. It is true that we only
mentioned the reproductive effort and not the reproductive outputs in the introduction (see line
113, “to assess whether small pelagic fish maintain a high reproductive effort, which could
potentially affect their maintenance, or not.”). To rectify, we added this missing aspect in the
ntroduction.
L110: “The main purpose of this study was on one hand to investigate the trade-off between the
different life-history traits and on the other hand to assess how fluctuated small pelagic fish
eproductive outputs.”
<U+F0B7> Keywords: trade-off, life history.
REPLY: Thank to the referee to point out this repetition with the title. These two keywords were
emoved.
NTRODUCTION
<U+F0B7> L.53-54. See comment about L.26-27.
REPLY: See previous answer to comment about L. 26-27.
<U+F0B7> L.65. I think that “(similar conclusions were demonstrated for turtles [11] or daphnia [12].” Is
totally unnecessary here.
REPLY: Because the first reviewer criticized the fact that we talked too early exclusively about small
pelagic in the introduction, and taking into account the large scope of the Royal Society Open Science
ournal, we would prefer to let diverse examples highlighting the large relevance to study life history
rade-offs of general species.
<U+F0B7> L.68. “the chance of survival” for the offspring.
REPLY: This was modified accordingly.
L69: “decrease the chance of survival for the offspring.”
<U+F0B7> L.63-85. This paragraph starts with SPF already, but then studies of other organisms than fish
are often referenced throughout the paragraph. Since it is already quite a long paragraph
(and Intro section), and it sounds repetitive, I’d suggest to reduce substantially the length of
this paragraph by just focusing on fish from here on. Moreover, I do not see how the capital-
income breeding aspect is properly connected to the rest of the information provided in this
paragraph.
REPLY: As for the reply to line 65, and according to the first reviewer, we think that it is preferable to
keep examples from non-fish species to appeal to the broad readership of your journal. Concerning
he capital-income breeding aspect, as we also talk about it in the following paragraph, we follow the
eferee advice and remove this aspect from this paragraph to help shortening it and make the
ntroduction clearer.
<U+F0B7> L.91. Ref #30 needs to be updated. There is a 2016 Report.
REPLY: We updated the FAO reference with the newest. (FAO, The state of world Fisheries and
Aquaculture (SOFIA) 2016).
<U+F0B7> L.106. Not sure what the authors mean here “Despite for evident socioeconomic reasons…”,
but the sentence sounds wrong.
REPLY: We apologize for this typo error, we removed this part and rewrite this sentence to make it
clearer for the reader.
L104: “While the trade-off between somatic and reproductive functions has been long considered
3,5,19,40], especially in the context of the slow-fast life-history gradient, these two species thus offer
a unique opportunity to investigate the cost of reproduction in a situation of food shortage in two
pecies sharing very similar characteristics but for their capital vs. income breeding strategies.”
<U+F0B7> L.111-113. It seems like the authors post two questions here: 1. to investigate the trade-off
between the different life-history traits, and 2. to assess whether small pelagic fish maintain
a high reproductive effort. In any case, the sentence needs to be rewritten; it is not clear
what the authors investigate exactly.
hypothesis are investigated in this study.
L110: “The main purpose of this study was on one hand to investigate the trade-off between the
different life-history traits and on the other hand to assess how fluctuated small pelagic fish
eproductive outputs.”
<U+F0B7> L.113-114 “The answer to this question could allow us to better understand the recent
fluctuations in the small pelagic fish populations of the Gulf of Lions” is not statement that
fits here. In fact, something similar is mentioned again at the end of this paragraph. I suggest
to remove this sentence.
REPLY: We agree with reviewer statement and have removed this sentence.
<U+F0B7> L.117. Why there is no mention here about the samples from the 1970s, as mentioned in
Abstract and M&M?
REPLY: The referee is right, we corrected the missing date.
L113: “We investigated their temporal changes between 2003 and 2015, a period in which drastic
hanges in body condition were observed and compared them to values in the 70s.”
<U+F0B7> L.121. Change relatively for relative.
REPLY: We changed the word according to referee.
L120: “Sampling effort and analyses were limited to females as their reproductive capacity is the main
driver of the population dynamics, caused by the high cost of egg production relative to the energy
needed for producing sperm [41,42].”
<U+F0B7> L. 125-126. could benefit THE management of their fisheries, not of the populations
themselves.
REPLY: We agree with this comment and we changed the sentence.
L125: “In turn, such understanding could benefit the management of their fisheries.”
M&M
<U+F0B7> L.131-134. So, does that mean that sardines from 1970s were captured from commercial
trawlers? If so, and they were immediately dissected once they were taken to the lab, that
would mean that those gonads have been kept in formaldehyde since then? Please clarify.
When were the measures and the maturity stages assessed for those “old” samples? Forty
year in formalin would very likely have made the maturity stage evaluation impossible, or at
least unreliable.
REPLY: We understand the referee queries. To be clear and concise, samples from the 70s were
collected on fish market immediately after landing and analyzed by scientists (length, mass, maturity,
gonad weight). No gonads were preserved in formaldehyde, so no gonad from this period was
available to histological and fecundity analyses. So no bias with conservation can be highlighted in
our data. We now clarify this aspect it the corrected new version:
L131: “Samples were randomly collected in trawls of scientific surveys (PELMED & MEDITS, from 2003
onwards) by successively dividing the total anchovy catch until the quantity necessary to analyses was
eached or obtain from commercial trawlers operating in the Gulf of Lions during all years. All
morphometric analyses were conducted following the same methodology so that data from different
years, periods, etc. would be comparable.”
<U+F0B7> L.155. Change reference format.
REPLY: The reference was formatted according to RSOS format.
<U+F0B7> L. 183. A reference is needed here.
REPLY: We added an accurate reference here as requested by the referee.
<U+F0B7> L. 188. Reproductive capacity. Again, my question is related to the 1970s samples. I assume
the authors did not perform any histological analysis on those gonads. A clarification of what
was actually done with those old samples for this study, or if the data have been already
analyzed and published, a mention of that work and a brief description of the methods
followed in it would be extremely useful.
REPLY: As says the referee, we did not perform any histological analysis on the 1970s samples. Data
were not previously published. We precised this with a complete sentence at the beginning of this
paragraph.
L196: “These analyses were made only on samples from the 2015 summer (anchovy) and the 2014-
2015 winter (sardine).”
<U+F0B7> L. 196. Brown-Peterson.
REPLY: The reference was formatted according to RSOS format.
<U+F0B7> L.196-201. Is this the same six-stage key described in L.137-141? If so, it should be clarified. If
not, only the one actually used in this study should be mentioned.
REPLY: This is not the same six-stage key used previously. This one is based only on oocyte aspect
and not on all the gonad aspect, and is used only for the reproductive capacity part, so this is why we
have two keys. We clarified it.
L203: “First, we used the terminology employed by [50] to histologically describe the developmental
tage of the oocytes”
<U+F0B7> L. 266. corresponds.
REPLY: We changed the word according to referee.
L275: “Therefore, age 1 anchovy spawning every 5.26 days corresponds to a size range…”
RESULTS
<U+F0B7> Some plots lack units in their axes.
REPLY: We added unit for GSI (%) and L50 (cm) in the corresponding plots.
<U+F0B7> Fig.3. I suggest to include error bars.
REPLY: We included error bars.
<U+F0B7> L.315-121. To follow the same order as in other sections, and in the Fig. 4, results for anchovy
should be described before sardine.
REPLY: We agree with the referee, this comment helped improving the flow and the readability of
he manuscript. We corrected this part and the following (see his comment for line 323) according to
his advice. Please, see line 309, 321, 325 334 and 353.
<U+F0B7> L.319. Anchovy GSI anomalies
REPLY: The word ‘anomalies’ was missing. This is now corrected.
L325: “Anchovy GSI anomalies exhibited significant variations between years”
<U+F0B7> Fig. 4. For anchovy is 2004-2015, not form 2003.
REPLY: We thank the referee to underline this mistake. The figure 4 caption is now corrected.
sardine results.
REPLY: As for the comment on lines 315 to 321, we have rewritten this paragraph to keep the order
with anchovy results before sardine ones. This improved the flow of the manuscript. Please, see line
309 to 369.
DISCUSSION
<U+F0B7> L. 365. “than in the past” (not “previously”).
REPLY: We thank the referee for its suggestion. We corrected the end of the sentence.
L374: “Recently, an increase of trophic overlap between small pelagic fish species was observed in the
Gulf of Lions at the same time as a decrease in fish body condition [33,61], supporting the hypothesis
hat food resources could be currently more limiting than in the past [45,61].”
<U+F0B7> L. 373-374. “starting in end April rather than May” would be better written as “starting in
late April instead of May”
REPLY: We thank the referee for its suggestion. We corrected the end of the sentence.
L385: “In particular, anchovy starts reproducing a bit earlier, now starting end of April instead of
May.”
<U+F0B7> L. 377-378. Is there any study supporting this? Please cite. Also, it should be re-written: no
totally clear what the authors mean with “plankton development” (it could be, for example,
ontogenetic development), and, in any case, it should say “occur earlier in the year”, not
“move forward”.
REPLY: As previous referee asked to be cautious with match-mismatch hypothesis, we remove this
entence to avoid too speculative discussion.
<U+F0B7> L. 383. Rejuvenation?
REPLY: Here, this word is used as we find mainly young female in the small pelagic fish population in
he Gulf of Lions. According to us, this word seems correct here, so we decided to keep it.
<U+F0B7> L. 410. Correct reference format.
REPLY: This mistake was also pointed out by the first referee, we corrected it.
<U+F0B7> L. 424. “higher resource availability”.
REPLY: We corrected it.
L438: “anchovy strategy allows them to take advantages of higher resource availability to invest in
both somatic growth and reproduction.”
<U+F0B7> L. 436-461. Why female lipid content (maternal condition) and size seem to be treated here
as if they exclude each other? It would make more sense to reason that maternal lipid
content will always be positively correlated with egg quality, regardless of the size of the
mother. Thus, the authors’ claim that smaller, younger mature females would relocate a
higher amount of energy into egg production cannot be validated with the results presented
here. Also, this paragraph is too long. I suggest to re-write the whole paragraph, eliminating
the highly speculative arguments.
REPLY: We think that the referee is underlining the fact that this sentence is too speculative (‘As a
rade-off between the number and size of offspring might emerge in situations of low resource levels
4], our results might indicate that small pelagic fish give priority to the size of their eggs and thus
heir viability’). Indeed, this sentence is unclear and confusing, as the paragraph is already too long
and this idea neither essential nor validated by results, we removed it.
factors that are not measured in the study (eg. Temperature (briefly suggested in L.374-375
as a factor affecting reproductive output), predation, food quality…), making this conclusion
purely speculative and without sound data support.
REPLY: We completely agree with the referee, this part was too speculative and just descriptive. To
horten the discussion, we removed this part.
<U+F0B7> L. 372-402 & 436-461 This are very long paragraphs.
REPLY: We entirely rewrote these paragraphs (see comment on line 436-461) to make them clearer
and shorter.
<U+F0B7> Why are not fisheries taken into consideration here? These two extremely important
commercial species and heavily exploited in the GoL, and the larger individuals are the main
target for the fisheries due to its higher market value. In fact, the authors claim that the
changes in size-at-maturity are due uniquely to a food shortage; however, that is a very
speculative statement, and other possibilities, such as fisheries pressure, should be
considered and discussed as well.
REPLY: See changes before (referee number 2).
L413: “…as well as fishing pressure. As [74] underlined the relatively low exploitation of both species
during study period in the study area, we do not think that fishing could be the main factor that has
nduced the observed changes in the studied indices. However, fishing can act as a co-variable, and its
mpact might be difficult to differentiate to environmental ones. Fishing activities can largely affect
he condition and reproductive potential of exploited fish in complex ways such as reducing the food
availability or inducing physiological stress (reviewed by [15]) and therefore we cannot fully discard
hat fishing activities in the area targeting anchovy and sardine, despite being moderate, can play a
ole on the observed changes. Therefore, further investigations are needed to consider the fishing
pressure on the condition and reproductive potential of small pelagic fish populations.”

Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
Both referees appreciate the effort that has been made to accommodate all of their previous points.
One referee, however, still has some concerns over some of the statistical analyses, as highlighted in
heir new report. It would be desirable to deal with these issues in order to make this manuscript as
trong as possible.
Reviewer: 3
The authors have fully addressed my concerns and all my comments. I congratulate the authors for
he impressive effort they made to improve the manuscript. I therefore consider that the paper is
now of high scientific quality and appropriate to be published.
Reviewer: 1
Thank you for taking the comments seriously and reviewing the manuscript accordingly. The attempt
o validate the indices is great and reveals the real problems of using traditional metrics uncritically.
The graphs provided by stages in your response suggest very biased residuals, have you checked the
normality of those residuals? some of them do not seem to be normally distributed, in some cases
hey are related to the x variable, in others the positive residuals are typically larger than the
negative ones, which could be easily fixed using a log transformed Y variable. Once again, this
departure from the assumption of isometry can potentially distort the results. I encourage you to
continue to critically approach this kind of analysis instead of accepting methodologies from the time
when modern computing techniques were unavailable.
REPLY: We wish to thank you and the two reviewers as well as the editorial staff, for your many
helpful comments and suggestions. Regarding the last concerns of the first reviewer we would like
irst to bring to light that all the assumptions of the different analyses presented in the manuscript
were validated (i.e normality of the residuals among others).
His concern is about the figure that we provided to him in the previous response to referees (see
hereafter). Among the six graphs, five have normally distributed residuals when one (i.e. the anchovy
tage 5) has normally distributed residuals after log transformation of gonad weight data (i.e. data on
he y-axis). After data transformation, the relationship is still significant, positive and does not
change results and conclusion that we can make. Furthermore, the definition of a size-free index of
esiduals were normally distributed, validating the assumption for the use of a linear model and our
conclusions. As the figure and the details of the index validation are not presented in the manuscript,
we felt that we could not add this explanation in the text.
Still, we share the reviewer’s comment on statistics and wish to emphasize again that statistical
analyses presented in the manuscript are as strong as possible, all assumptions being checked
beforehand. Therefore, we added details in one sentence (L289) “For all relationships and metrics
e.g. GSI, RBF), residuals were tested for normality and homogeneity of variance, and transformed if
necessary.”
We hope that the manuscript is now suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science and look
orward to hearing from you soon.
Yours sincerely,
Pablo Brosset, on behalf of all co-authors.
