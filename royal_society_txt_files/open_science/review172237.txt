Associate Editor Comments to Author (Professor Stephen Hesselbo):
Associate Editor
Comments to the Author:
This contribution describes experiments on the sorption of P in sediments collected from three
Chinese lakes characterised by contrasting trophic statuses. The results show differences in the
sorption behaviours of the sediments in the lakes in different seasons and at different
9
temperatures. The methods and results are clearly described and presented, and the first order
interpretations of the results are presented in a logical fashion.
The wider implications and applications of the results are not explored in detail, but the authors
argue that the results serve as a foundation for further theoretical analysis. The reviewers have
provided generalised comments on the manuscript, but both recommended publication after
revisions. The referees suggested revisions have been carried out reasonably diligently and this
manuscript may be publishable with minor further revision.
Some further points that the authors should consider are:
Comment on how representative the samples are for the studied lakes and why.
Comment on grain size and mineralogical characteristics of the sediment samples so far as these
are known as requested by Referee 2.
Make explicit reference to the method of analysis of lake water samples used.
The English language is still awkward and the annotated PDF contains suggested changes,
principally in relation to tense.
Acknowledgements and Funding sections repeat the same text. Avoid repetition.

Title: Seasonal characteristics of phosphorus sorption by
sediments from plain lakes with different trophic statuses
Royal Society Open Science
Data accessibility, Authors’ contributions, Competing interests,
and Acknowledgement , Funding, and Research Ethics were
provided at the end of the manuscript.
We have studied the valuable comments from the previous and current
reviewers carefully. We also did our best to revise the manuscript. The
manuscript was revised using blue font tags. The authors’ replies
are underlined below each of the reviewers’ comments. Our
point-by-point responses to the reviewer’s comments are listed as
follows:
In addition, the author Kun Wang and Xia Jiang contributed equally to
this article. Both of them revised the article for important intellectual
content.
Answers to Reviewer 1:
(1) The novelty/originality shall be further justified by highlighting
that the manuscript contains sufficient contributions to the new body
of knowledge. Novelty should be better explained.
Response: This study analyze the influence of the season on P sorption
characteristics in sediment from regions with different trophic status,
and study the mechanism of P sorption in sediment. The results can
identify the role of sediment of P source or pool, and it can also
provide a theoretical foundation for the control of P release in
sediments from different trophic statuses.
(2) In the linguistic description, authors should be obeyed research
paper or research manuscript style. I strongly advise that you either
seek the assistance of a native English-speaking colleague.
Response: Two reviewers and Editorial office referred the question.
We followed the reviewer’s suggestion, and carefully read the whole
manuscript again and made further correction using blue font tags. We
tried our best to make the manuscript read logically or explain
adequately. Before we submitted the manuscript, the manuscript was
also polished by a professional editing company.
(3) More contents should be added in the Discussion part.
Response: The two reviewers referred this comment. We added some
contents in Discussion. For example, we added the discussion of the
influence factors of P sorption capacity (Line 318-336), and revised
the Abstract, Discussion, and Conclusion.
Answers to Reviewer 2:
(1) Title: “ Seasonal characteristics of phosphorus sorption in
sediments of <U+3002><U+3002><U+3002>”,Where? Water?
Response: The objective of this study was to analyze the influence of
the season on P sorption characteristics in sediment from regions with
different trophic status, and study the mechanism of P sorption in
sediment (Line 84-86). We were focus on the phosphorus sorption in
sediments, and in the section of 2.1, we also referred the sampling time,
sampling sites, sampling methods, and sampling measurement.
(2) Line 17 “P sorption characteristics of sediments from three lakes”.
Language issues.
Response: We have made the correction in the revised manuscript
(Line 17).
(3) Line 24, different temperatures, Should detail, at ** temperature
Response: We have added the detailed temperature in the revised
manuscript (Line 24).
(4) Line 24-25, Language issues
Response: We have revised the sentences (Line 25).
(5) Line 32-33, should give suggestion/or general conclusion
Response: We provided the general conclusion at the end of Abstract
(Line 32-34).
(6) Line 82-90. Should focus research goals
Response: At the end of Introduction, we referred that “the objective
of this study was to analyze the influence of the season on P sorption
characteristics in sediment from regions with different trophic status,
and study the mechanism of P sorption in sediment (Line 84-86)”. The
objective is also the goals of this study, and all the experiments were
conducted around this goal.
(7) Line 96-97. Give date for sampling
Response: The date for sampling, such as sampling time, sampling
sites, sampling methods, and sampling measurement. The
physicochemical parameters of the samples were also shown in Table
1. The date for sampling has been provided in the part of Methods and
materials (Line 96-100),
(8) Line 98-99. Give thickness of sampling, how to take sample, what
is Sampler?
Response: We collected the surface sediments (0-10 cm) using grab
sediment sampler. The information has been provide in the part of
Methods and materials (Line 100-102),
(9) Line 116-117. Fresh sample, or dry sample for 0.2g
Response: The samples were freeze-dried, ground, and passed through
a 100-mesh (0.15 mm) sieve to obtain uniform size (Line 104). All the
samples used in kinetic sorption, sorption isotherm, thermodynamic
parameters, analysis of P fraction experiments were dry samples. We
also referred in the first of Methods and materials (Line 104-105).
(10) Line 145. Why at 35 °C?
Response: In this study, we chose the sediment samples from four
seasons in eastern plain of China (Line 69). The environmental
temperature of eastern plain of China in summer is usually around
35°C. Therefore, we conducted the experiments under the temperature
of 35 °C during all the experiments.
(11) Line 314- 316. It is not only related to temperature, but also to the
nature of sediments.,should give more discussion
Response: The OM content in sediment can also influence the P
sorption capacity except for temperature. We updated the sentences
and added more discussion in the revised manuscript (Line 318-331).
(12) Line 316-331. In addition to organic matter, sediment particle size
and distribution should also have an impact. Should give detail
discussion
Response: The OM content, Fe, Al, and Ca oxide were also the main
factors of P sorption capacity. We discussed the influence factors (OM,
Fe, Al, and Ca oxide) of P sorption capacity together, and adjusted the
structure of this part of Discussion (Line 318-336).
(13) Line 395. Should give general conclusion /or suggestion
Response: We revised adjusted the structure of Conclusion (Line
404-414).
