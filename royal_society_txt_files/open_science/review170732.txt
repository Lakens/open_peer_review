Authors present a fabrication of Nanoscale Ionic Materials (NIM) based on nano-CaCo3 as the
core. This has practical advantages due to abundance of CaCO3. The advantage of the used
method is the in-situ preparation of the PQAC corona, which prevents agglomeration of the
nanoparticles and a fluid nanoparticle system was obtained. This preparation method is faster
and cheaper in terms of industrial applications than the other method reported for this purpose.
Chemical grafting of these structures provided relatively high ionic electrical conductivity.
All of the main statements are supported by experiment and arguments in the manuscript are
sound.
There are a few issues that need attention:
a) P. 13, line 16. NPEP canopy is said to make 60.35 % of the weight of the system. Is this value
realistic, considering the 4-6 nm thickness on the CaCo3 nanoparticles, which are 60nm of size?
b) P. 10, lines 11-14. "...stretching vibrations of C-O bond..." is mentioned, whereas t he Figure
shows O-C-O . I am not sure if authors can state that this " confirms" the presence of calcite. It is
CONSISTENT with it. There are other bands in the spectrum that were not assigned, at ~1800 and
2500 cm-1, would these be from impurities?
c) Figs. 2 d and e are not the structures framed in Fig. 2c. Likewise Fig. 2 b is not showing the
framed section of Fig. 2a
d) There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors in the manuscript: p.2 l.ine14, p.8 line 45,
p.13 line 19 etc.

The work of Wang et al. Is dealing with the synthesis and characterization of some ionic liquid-
like NIMs based on CaCO3. Even though the materials look very interesting, I find that the
novelty of this work is rather moderate as very similar materials and their properties have been
thoroughly investigated by Giannelis and coworkers (as the authors clearly also underline). The
electrical properties study is however interesting and therefore I believe that the paper deserves
publication with major revisions (see following items).
1. From a chemical point of view Figure 1 is wrong. There is no covalent bond between the
quaternary N (exactly because it is quaternary) and the Cl anions. The Cl anions or any other
kind of anions remain intact on the nanomaterial due to electrostatic forces developed between
then and the positively charged nitrogen atoms. I.e. Any covalent bond between Cl- or R-SO3-
and the N+ atoms should be deleted.
2. I find that the analysis/characterization of the obtained materials is incomplete. Surely FTIR
indicated the sucessful ion exchange however there are other methods which could clearly be
used in addition to FTIR. I propose X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as well as solid state
NMR if the latter if possible. The material presented are quite big so I believe it will be possible to
address this item.
3. As a continuation of the previous item, could the authors also utilize TGA spectrometry
conbined with FTIR in order to analyze any decomposition products upon heating? Is the
reactions presented here selective in the authors' opinion? Are there any un-exchanged Cl- ions
coexisting with RSO3- ions after the reaction ?
4. Moreover, is there some effect of different media in the structure of the materials? In other
words is there some solvent polarity effect on the reactions presented here and furthermore on
the structure of the materials? Could the authors make use of another solvent system for the
preparation of the presented materials?

It appears, the authors satisfactorily ANSWERED the issues raised in the first review, however
they did not satisfactorily IMPLEMENT these changes in the manuscript:
a) The issue of the weight difference (DTA/TGA) should be explained in the manuscript.
b) It seems, the text regarding the spectrum was added, but the old text was not removed. This
resulted in confusing text (p.12, lines 11-22).
c) If framing is difficult to perform, it may be better not to use framing, but just describe in figure
caption that Figs 2b, 2d and 2e show the zoomed-in structure of corresponding figures.

Response to reviewers’ comments
To: Reviewer 1#
We greatly appreciate for your helpful suggestions about how to improve our article. We have
made a revision throughout toward our manuscript following with your suggestions. We have
presented all of the changes highlighted in the revised manuscript and also explained these
evisions point by point as follows.
(1) The weight percent of 60.35 wt.% for the NPEP canopy was realistic, because it was
determined by the weight loss in TGA analysis. The TEM images just presented the dispersed
NIM particles, in which the thickness of macromolecular canopy can be distinguished. However,
here are much more aggregated NIM particles which have thicker canopy layer. Moreover, the
macromolecular canopy has much higher density than the CaCO3 core, so the weight percent of
60.35 wt.% for the NPEP canopy is believable.
(2) We corrected the wrong statement in the sentence that you pointed out. The three
characteristic peaks we marked in Figure 4 are attributed to the carbonate ions as mentioned by
he reference we cited. Moreover, the calcite phase was also identified by XRD pattern. So we can
CONFIRMS the presence of calcite. The weak peaks at ~1800 and 2500 is due to the presence
of the water and CO2 absorbed by the nanoscale ionic materials, so we did not assigned these
mall peaks.
(3) Because it is very hard to give an accurate framework in the SEM scope we observed, we
has just divided approximate frameworks in Fig. 2a for Figs. 2b and in Fig. 2c for Figs. 2d and 2e.
(4) The spelling and grammatical errors have been corrected, and the English manuscript has
been polished.

point by point as follows.
(1) We corrected the mistakes about covalent bond in Figure 1 as you pointed out.
(2) We characterized the NIMs by using solid state NMR according to your suggestion, and
also presented the relevant results and discussion in the revised manuscript.
(3) We characterized the NIMs by using TG-FTIR spectroscopy according to your suggestion,
and also presented the relevant results and discussion in the revised manuscript. As we conducted
he TG-FTIR analysis, the un-exchanged Cl-ions were not found from the resulting infrared
pectra.
(4) As reported by the relevant references, only water can be used as a medium to prepare the
CaCO3-based NIMs because the Cl-ions can only be removed by an aqueous medium. By now,
we have not found any references reporting the synthesis of CaCO3-based NIMs using the other
olvents.
