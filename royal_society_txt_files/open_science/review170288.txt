Li et al's "The Victoria West: earliest prepared core technology in the Acheulean and implications
for the cognitive evolution of early hominids" is a timely and well written contribution
highlighting the seemingly early practice of prepared core technology (Victoria West) in the
South African Acheulean. The figures of the cores are clear and certainly (at least to my mind)
demonstrate preparation for the removal of large preferential flakes from a prepared core
strategy. The text is balanced, eloquent, concise and well supported throughout by reference to
relevant literature. There is little that I can (or would want to) suggest to change this paper.
Perhaps one thought I have is that the authors tackle in a little more detail the difference in
prepared core technology for the extraction of large side struck flakes to make handaxes, vs the
diversity of Levallois prepared core technology in regards to points, laminar, and radial flakes.
The authors do mention this in their discussion, but I wonder if more could be made of the
distinction between the diversity of end product seen in Levallois vs the "monotonous" large
flakes for handaxes discussed in this paper in regards to hominin behaviour and cognition. As I
have stated, this is a minor point for me as the authors do tackle this issue in the discussion
(although it would be nice to see a bit more embellishment on this theme), hence the
recommendation that it is published as is.

The study applies 3D methodology and statistical and morphological analysis to the study of an
assemblage of Victoria West (VW) cores from a single layer in Canteen Kopje (CK). I will be
straightforward – such analysis is worth doing only if it reveals new data, a new point-of-view
3
and new interpretation. Unfortunately, the analysis presented in the paper seems to invest great
effort in stating the obvious. Anyone looking at a VW core sees that the two faces are
asymmetrical. There is no need to scan the cores and run heavy statistical morphometric analysis
just to get to the conclusion that they are, indeed, asymmetrical. I feel that the researchers have
not demonstrated new observations or interpretations justifying application of the method
presented.
Below are specific notes and questions regarding the paper:
I think that the view of the Acheulian presented in the introduction is oversimplified and
incorrectly concentrates on the South African data. I think that looking at the Acheulian as a
single stage of stable technology is no longer valid: Early Acheulian, Large Flake Acheulian, Late
Acheulian, handaxe only assemblages, Achelo-Yabrudian…The Acheulian is changing and
evolving.
The description of the site and assemblage is very brief and, as a result, it is hard to evaluate the
nature of the assemblage and the observations made.
- It is unclear why the authors ignore the other Vaal river sites (Pniel 6, Pliel 7, Power’s
Site) and refer to much further sites.
- I could not understand what is the volume of the excavated layer b. From what size
come the VW cores?
- Are the cores in situ or did they result from a secondary deposit? They come from large
clast sediment – alluvial? And, in particular, when looking at the layer above layer b, layer a,
which is a mix of Late and Middle Stone Age and Fouresmith together.
- What does the lithic assemblage of layer b comprise? Are there LCT’s? Other types of
cores, small tools? What other raw materials were used? The way the core assemblage is
presented, with no context, makes is hard to evaluate.
- Local terminology is used without explanation – e.g. what are koppies (Line 131?). I am
not sure all readers are familiar with the local terminology.
As a result of these omissions, I find the claims regarding the raw material unconvincing. Claims
such as that andesite was used because it was available should be supported by data. The claim
that the original size of the core was of boulder clast size (line 133) is also unsubstantiated.
“The lateral and distal convexities are also important features of the Victoria West cores”. (line
156) – Why is that so? What can we learn from this data?
More importantly, the authors refer to “organize core” as the primary technology present in the
layer below the VW layer B. But what do they mean by this term? What is the difference between
these cores and the VW cores? Why is VW an evolution from the organized core? Many of the
claims in the paper are hard to evaluate because we do not know what organized cores are.
One of the main problems of the study is that it is focused on the cores only and ignores the LCTs
from the assemblage. As a result, I think many of the observations are misleading. This is the
emphasis in the discussion of the striking platforms – basing technological and morphological
claims about the SP from the scars remaining on the core leads to misinterpretation (in my view)
of the nature of the VW SP as well as to problematic claims about the type of hammer used etc. I
also think that the discussion misses the primary difference between VW and Levallois – the
isolation of the platform in Levallois which is nonexistent in VW.
I am surprised by the claim that VW cores show large variability in size. Is that because the VW
collections studied to date were all very selective? This could have been the primary contribution
of the paper – for the first time a study of a complete in-situ assemblage of cores and not a
selective surface collection. The claims are based on supplementary pictures, and we do not know
if the assemblage has additional core types. The cores in supplementary pictures look heavily
weathered, so I cannot judge what I think about the definition of the layer b cores as VW cores.
4
Because the discussion is focused exclusively on the cores, the fact that most LCTs from the Vaal
sites are cleavers is missed. Judging the type of the resulting tool from the shape of the scar is
dangerous.
In conclusion, I see three primary problems in the paper:
1. The application of a new method did not teach us anything new about VW cores. Using
sophisticated tools to confirm what we already know is stating the obvious.
2. The archaeological data is not presented and, as a result, the VW cores are “out of
context” making many claims and observations problematic and hard to evaluate.
3. The study of the cores alone without the rest of the assemblage, in particular the LCTs,
results in problematic observations and interpretations of the data.

Review
General comments
This is a good paper that deserves to be published. The work is well organized, well written and
well researched. The authors present data about the Victoria West knapping technology at the
Acheulian site of Canteen Kopje with an age of around 1 Ma. This is claimed as the oldest
evidence in the world for the use of this complex volumetric technology. After a brief
introduction describing, in general, the question of stasis or dynamics during the very long phase
of the Acheulian, there is an introduction to the Canteen Kopje site context and excavation. This is
followed by a presentation of the methodology used to study the VW core sample which is
clearly presented and relatively innovative. Results confirm the intentional, highly standardized
nature of the hierarchical core reduction method of VW. Although the result is not necessarily
‘new’ (Sharon and Beaumont, 2006), the methodology provides a new way to achieve objective
confirmation of the complex volumetric and hierarchical nature of these cores. The authors also
explain the similarities and differences that this highly standardized prepared core technology
5
bears with the (more diversified) Levallois core reduction methods. Finally, some remarks
concerning the implications on Acheulian cognition levels in this timeframe are made.
Specific comments and suggestions
- The name of the site could be added into the title: “Earliest Victoria West prepared core
technology at the Acheulian site of Canteen Kopje: implications for the evolution of hominin
cognition”
- We recommend the authors use the word ‘hominin’ rather than ‘hominid’.
- (Introduction) The timeframe for the duration of the Acheulian should be qualified in
accordance to its geographical distribution, with the appropriate bibliographical references.
- The paper is missing some more adequate description of the overall assemblage (15000 artifacts
from Pit 6). In the introduction the authors state that the Canteen Kopje assemblage is described
in Leader (2013), which is an un-published PhD thesis. It would, therefore, be useful to provide at
least some basic information about the rest of the assemblage of which these VW cores form a
part. Their context is certainly vital to correctly assessing the cognition levels of the hominin
artisans and also of the significance and meaning of the toolkit as a whole.
- What are the features of the basal Early Acheulian assemblage and how does it differ from the
VW core assemblage?
- Some parts of this manuscript do overlap with previous publications (Sharon and Beaumont,
2006).
- What about the flakes? Have any flakes been identified that belong to any parts of the operative
scheme of Victoria West production? Especially, are there any of the preferential flakes in the
assemblage? Have they been recognized as blanks among the handaxes and cleavers? If so, it
would be interesting to provide some photos of this material as well. If VW blanks could be
identified among the LCT supports, this would perhaps give credence the proposal that specific
flake pre-forms were intentionally made to be transformed into either cleavers of handaxes; as
claimed by the authors.
- Also, can a size range preference for cleavers and handaxes be confirmed from the preferential
flake negative measurements?
- Given the size range of these cores, it seems that the preferential flakes qualify as ‘Large Flakes’
in the strict sense (Sharon, 2009 and references). It seems therefore that at least a short
explanation of the ‘Large Flake Acheulian’ is in order (in the Introduction and/or
Discussion/Conclusion).
- Concerning the dating, it is not really made clear whether the age evaluation is reliable or not:
‘preliminary’ and ‘unpublished data’; broad comparison with a paleomagnetic date at a nearby
site… is this really reliable or perhaps more explanations are needed here? This is especially
important if the authors wish to maintain their claim of ‘oldest’ evidence for prepared core
technology.
- The VW cores are made exclusively from Andesite: are there any other raw materials available
nearby? Which ones? What is the size-range of the naturally available cobbles?
- More specifically; what are the differences between this assemblage and the older nearby site of
Rietputs? Why is this concept “…well beyond the organized core reduction strategies…” used at
Rietputs (where there are also cores with preferential removals)?
- It may be preferable to use the word ‘knapping’ instead of ‘shaping’ when speaking about core
preparation.
- Write the French “chaîne opératoire” in italics.
- Finally, does the highly standardized nature of these cores really imply a “lack of technological
flexibility” in relation to Levallois technologies or is it indicative of a strongly binding techno-
social tradition?
- Figures and table are clear and reference list is commendable.

Appendix A
Dear Dr Li
On behalf of the Editors, I am pleased to inform you that your Manuscript RSOS-170288 entitled "The
Victoria West: earliest prepared core technology in the Acheulean and implications for the cognitive
evolution of early hominids" has been accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science subject
to minor revision in accordance with the referee suggestions. Please find the referees' comments at the
end of this email.
The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript. One aspect that is raised by the critical reviewer, and one which I think warrants some
response, is the issue of whether your chosen analytical techniques simply "state the obvious". I suspect
you disagree strongly, and would urge you to articulate in a sentence or two why the CT imaging
techniques are preferable to more qualitative evaluations of flakes shapes, symmetries etc. I would also
appreciate a single sentence explaining to the interested, but inexpert, reader just what a "core" is. This
is an interdisciplinary journal and I would like articles to be accessible to a wider readership. In my
field, earth sciences, cores are something else altogether.
Response: A statement of the clear advantage of using CT scanning is added, see page 6. Our study
does not simply state the obvious, but it provides insights in understanding the preparation process of
VW cores. Calculation of the asymmetry index demonstrates quantitatively both the asymmetrical
nature of VW cores and the degree of asymmetry. The CT scanning technique also allows us to
demonstrate the intentional maintenance of lateral and distal edge convexities, which are not often
recognized in previous studies. In addition, geometric morphometric analysis of the shape of VW cores
can only be easily and accurately achieved by using the 3D models of those cores.
An explanation of “core” in the Palaeolithic archaeology is added, see page 3.

Two of the three referees are very positive about the paper, whereas the third has a number of
reservations. The addition of some more contextual information should address the suggestions of the
third referee and also go some way to mollifying the second. Please do read through and extract the
constructive comments from both reviewers as it will make the paper more accessible and readable for
non-specialists.
Response: More contextual information has been added in the text, see page 4.

Li et al's "The Victoria West: earliest prepared core technology in the Acheulean and implications for
the cognitive evolution of early hominids" is a timely and well written contribution highlighting the
seemingly early practice of prepared core technology (Victoria West) in the South African Acheulean.
The figures of the cores are clear and certainly (at least to my mind) demonstrate preparation for the
removal of large preferential flakes from a prepared core strategy. The text is balanced, eloquent,
concise and well supported throughout by reference to relevant literature. There is little that I can (or
would want to) suggest to change this paper.
Perhaps one thought I have is that the authors tackle in a little more detail the difference in prepared
core technology for the extraction of large side struck flakes to make handaxes, vs the diversity of
Levallois prepared core technology in regards to points, laminar, and radial flakes. The authors do
mention this in their discussion, but I wonder if more could be made of the distinction between the
diversity of end product seen in Levallois vs the "monotonous" large flakes for handaxes discussed in
this paper in regards to hominin behaviour and cognition. As I have stated, this is a minor point for me
as the authors do tackle this issue in the discussion (although it would be nice to see a bit more
embellishment on this theme), hence the recommendation that it is published as is.

The study applies 3D methodology and statistical and morphological analysis to the study of an
assemblage of Victoria West (VW) cores from a single layer in Canteen Kopje (CK). I will be
straightforward – such analysis is worth doing only if it reveals new data, a new point-of-view and new
interpretation. Unfortunately, the analysis presented in the paper seems to invest great effort in stating
the obvious. Anyone looking at a VW core sees that the two faces are asymmetrical. There is no need to
scan the cores and run heavy statistical morphometric analysis just to get to the conclusion that they
are, indeed, asymmetrical. I feel that the researchers have not demonstrated new observations or
interpretations justifying application of the method presented.
Response: By using the CT scanning technique, we were able to scan very large cores and not only
quantitatively confirm the asymmetrical nature of the two surfaces of VW cores, but also demonstrate
the intentional creation of lateral and distal convexities of cores. Thus, comprehensive comparisons
between VW cores and Levallois cores can be documented. In addition, 3D models of VW cores
produced by scanning allow us to conduct a geometric morphometric analysis of the shape of those
cores.
Below are specific notes and questions regarding the paper:
I think that the view of the Acheulian presented in the introduction is oversimplified and incorrectly
concentrates on the South African data. I think that looking at the Acheulian as a single stage of stable
technology is no longer valid: Early Acheulian, Large Flake Acheulian, Late Acheulian, handaxe only
assemblages, Achelo-Yabrudian…The Acheulian is changing and evolving.
Response: It is also our suggestion that the Acheulean itself changed with the time, as shown by the
evidence we listed in the second paragraph of introduction part. Our study in this paper provides
additional evidence to confirm this point.
The description of the site and assemblage is very brief and, as a result, it is hard to evaluate the nature
of the assemblage and the observations made.
- It is unclear why the authors ignore the other Vaal river sites (Pniel 6, Pliel 7, Power’s Site) and
refer to much further sites.
Response: Other Acheulean sites along the Vaal River are added in the text, see page 4.
- I could not understand what is the volume of the excavated layer b. From what size come the VW
cores?
Response: The excavated volume for layer B in Pit 6 is about 6 m3.
- Are the cores in situ or did they result from a secondary deposit? They come from large clast
sediment – alluvial? And, in particular, when looking at the layer above layer b, layer a, which is a mix
of Late and Middle Stone Age and Fouresmith together.
Response: Because all VW cores are buried in coarse alluvial deposits, it is clear that the artifacts are
deposited in a secondary context. See page 4 for the deposit description. Layer A is an Aeolian deposit
with LSA, MSA and Fauresmith artefacts that seals the unconformable surface of the VW alluvial
deposit.
- What does the lithic assemblage of layer b comprise? Are there LCT’s? Other types of cores, small
tools? What other raw materials were used? The way the core assemblage is presented, with no context,
makes is hard to evaluate.
Response: We add more contextual information for the whole assemblage from layer B, please see
pages 4 and 5.
- Local terminology is used without explanation – e.g. what are koppies (Line 131?). I am not sure
all readers are familiar with the local terminology.
Response: We add an explanation for koppies in the text, see page 4.
As a result of these omissions, I find the claims regarding the raw material unconvincing. Claims such
as that andesite was used because it was available should be supported by data. The claim that the
original size of the core was of boulder clast size (line 133) is also unsubstantiated.
Response: We have explained in the text that andesite is frequently exposed in the nearby koppies in
the form of large clasts. Stratigraphy exposed during excavation of Pit 6 also shows that the
boulder-sized andesite clasts occurred in the gravel layer. See page 5 and figure 1c.
“The lateral and distal convexities are also important features of the Victoria West cores”. (line 156) –
Why is that so? What can we learn from this data?
Response: The intentional maintenance of lateral and distal convexities of cores is used to produce a
flake with pre-planned shape, and this is regarded as a key attribute in defining the Levallois
technology. The confirmation of such an attribute on the VW cores shows the sophistication of the VW
core technology.
More importantly, the authors refer to “organize core” as the primary technology present in the layer
below the VW layer B. But what do they mean by this term? What is the difference between these cores
and the VW cores? Why is VW an evolution from the organized core? Many of the claims in the paper
are hard to evaluate because we do not know what organized cores are.
Response: We add an explanation for the organized core in the text, see page 4. In general, the
organized cores are not fully prepared, but VW cores can fit well within the strictly defined prepared
core technology.
One of the main problems of the study is that it is focused on the cores only and ignores the LCTs from
the assemblage. As a result, I think many of the observations are misleading. This is the emphasis in the
discussion of the striking platforms – basing technological and morphological claims about the SP from
the scars remaining on the core leads to misinterpretation (in my view) of the nature of the VW SP as
well as to problematic claims about the type of hammer used etc. I also think that the discussion misses
the primary difference between VW and Levallois – the isolation of the platform in Levallois which is
nonexistent in VW.
Response: It is true that our discussion of the striking platforms of VW cores is based on the negative
scars remaining on the cores. This is because the striking platforms have been removed during the final
knapping of preferential flakes, and thus we can only estimate the possible existence of platform
preparation during detaching the final removals. We note this issue on page 8.
I am surprised by the claim that VW cores show large variability in size. Is that because the VW
collections studied to date were all very selective? This could have been the primary contribution of the
paper – for the first time a study of a complete in-situ assemblage of cores and not a selective surface
collection. The claims are based on supplementary pictures, and we do not know if the assemblage has
additional core types. The cores in supplementary pictures look heavily weathered, so I cannot
judge what I think about the definition of the layer b cores as VW cores.
Response: As the reviewer mentioned, our analysis of a complete excavated assemblage provides a rare
case to reveal the size variation of VW cores. Specimens in the supplementary figure 3 did experience
a certain degree of weathering, but the outlines of flaking scars on these cores are still recognizable.
Because the discussion is focused exclusively on the cores, the fact that most LCTs from the Vaal sites
are cleavers is missed. Judging the type of the resulting tool from the shape of the scar is dangerous.
Response: In the VW assemblage we studied, the number of cleavers (n=76) is indeed larger than
handaxes (n=35) in our assemblage. However, the preferential scars on most cores suggests that
cleavers were less commonly made with the method than handaxes, because the shape of working edge
(cleaver bit) would need to be further shaped to achieve the cleaver form.
In conclusion, I see three primary problems in the paper:
1. The application of a new method did not teach us anything new about VW cores. Using
sophisticated tools to confirm what we already know is stating the obvious.
Response: Again, by using the CT scanning technique, we can not only quantitatively confirm the
asymmetrical nature of the two surfaces of VW cores, but also demonstrate the intentional keeping of
lateral and distal convexities of cores by hominids. In addition, 3D models of VW cores produced by
scanning allow us conducting a geometric morphometric analysis of the shape of VW cores. See page 6.
2. The archaeological data is not presented and, as a result, the VW cores are “out of context” making
many claims and observations problematic and hard to evaluate.
Response: Relevant information has been added in the text, see pages 4 and 5.
3. The study of the cores alone without the rest of the assemblage, in particular the LCTs, results in
problematic observations and interpretations of the data.
Response: Information regarding the LCTs in the assemblage has been added, see page 9.

Review
General comments
This is a good paper that deserves to be published. The work is well organized, well written and well
researched. The authors present data about the Victoria West knapping technology at the Acheulian site
of Canteen Kopje with an age of around 1 Ma. This is claimed as the oldest evidence in the world for
the use of this complex volumetric technology. After a brief introduction describing, in general, the
question of stasis or dynamics during the very long phase of the Acheulian, there is an introduction to
the Canteen Kopje site context and excavation. This is followed by a presentation of the methodology
used to study the VW core sample which is clearly presented and relatively innovative. Results confirm
the intentional, highly standardized nature of the hierarchical core reduction method of VW. Although
the result is not necessarily ‘new’ (Sharon and Beaumont, 2006), the methodology provides a new way
to achieve objective confirmation of the complex volumetric and hierarchical nature of these cores. The
authors also explain the similarities and differences that this highly standardized prepared core
technology bears with the (more diversified) Levallois core reduction methods. Finally, some remarks
concerning the implications on Acheulian cognition levels in this timeframe are made.
Specific comments and suggestions
- The name of the site could be added into the title: “Earliest Victoria West prepared core technology at
the Acheulian site of Canteen Kopje: implications for the evolution of hominin cognition”
Response: According to reviewer’s suggestion, we change the title to “The Victoria West: earliest
prepared core technology in the Acheulean at Canteen Kopje and implications for the cognitive
evolution of early hominids”.
- We recommend the authors use the word ‘hominin’ rather than ‘hominid’.
Response: Although this is a popular word to use nowadays, there is considerable debate on the
taxonomic implications of the term hominin, and we prefer to use the traditional terms.
- (Introduction) The timeframe for the duration of the Acheulian should be qualified in accordance to
its geographical distribution, with the appropriate bibliographical references.
Response: We now state the timeframe for the Acheulean in terms of different areas, i.e., Africa and
Eurasian continent. See page 3.
- The paper is missing some more adequate description of the overall assemblage (15000 artifacts from
Pit 6). In the introduction the authors state that the Canteen Kopje assemblage is described in Leader
(2013), which is an un-published PhD thesis. It would, therefore, be useful to provide at least some
basic information about the rest of the assemblage of which these VW cores form a part. Their context
is certainly vital to correctly assessing the cognition levels of the hominin artisans and also of the
significance and meaning of the toolkit as a whole.
Response: Information concerning the overall assemblage is added, please see page 4.
- What are the features of the basal Early Acheulian assemblage and how does it differ from the VW
core assemblage?
Response: An explanation of the differences is added in the text, please see page 4.
- Some parts of this manuscript do overlap with previous publications (Sharon and Beaumont, 2006).
Response: We do realize that some of our conclusions are consistent with the results acquired by
Sharon and Beaumont (2006), but our study focuses on a detailed quantitative analysis of VW cores
base on CT scanning technique, and the new insights about those cores that have been achieved.
- What about the flakes? Have any flakes been identified that belong to any parts of the operative
scheme of Victoria West production? Especially, are there any of the preferential flakes in the
assemblage? Have they been recognized as blanks among the handaxes and cleavers? If so, it would be
interesting to provide some photos of this material as well. If VW blanks could be identified among the
LCT supports, this would perhaps give credence the proposal that specific flake pre-forms were
intentionally made to be transformed into either cleavers of handaxes; as claimed by the authors.
Response: No such flakes have been identified at present, probably because the blanks were
transformed into LCTs. Other evidence also confirms the use of preferential flakes to make LCTs, e.g.,
handaxes and cleavers. In the Victoria West assemblage, handaxes and cleavers are mainly made on
large flake blanks, with actually only two specimens are made directly on cobbles. In addition, the sizes
of handaxes and cleavers are consistent with the sizes of the preferential flakes calculated from the
negative scars retained on cores. See page 9 for the explanation.
- Also, can a size range preference for cleavers and handaxes be confirmed from the preferential flake
negative measurements?
Response: We provide measurement data for cleavers and handaxes in this assemblage. It does confirm
the size consistency between large flakes and LCTs. See page 9.
- Given the size range of these cores, it seems that the preferential flakes qualify as ‘Large Flakes’ in
the strict sense (Sharon, 2009 and references). It seems therefore that at least a short explanation of the
‘Large Flake Acheulian’ is in order (in the Introduction and/or Discussion/Conclusion).
Response: A statement of the Large Flake Acheulean tradition for the VW core assemblage is added in
the text. See page 9.
- Concerning the dating, it is not really made clear whether the age evaluation is reliable or not:
‘preliminary’ and ‘unpublished data’; broad comparison with a paleomagnetic date at a nearby site… is
this really reliable or perhaps more explanations are needed here? This is especially important if the
authors wish to maintain their claim of ‘oldest’ evidence for prepared core technology.
Response: We believe that the cosmogenic nuclide burial method of Al26/Be10 discussed in Leader
(2013) will, with further work on the deposits in our excavations, be able to confirm the age estimate
we cite for the Victoria West core assemblage. But for now, we can only cite the Beaumont and Vogel
age published in 2006.
- The VW cores are made exclusively from Andesite: are there any other raw materials available nearby?
Which ones? What is the size-range of the naturally available cobbles?
Response: Hornfels is another raw material used at the site, but in a quite small proportion. For instance,
there is 98.2% of LCTs made on andesite. The remaining is made on hornfels. Regarding the size of
cobbles, we have said in the text that “boulder-sized clasts being the most commonly used”. See page 5.
- More specifically; what are the differences between this assemblage and the older nearby site of
Rietputs? Why is this concept “…well beyond the organized core reduction strategies…” used at
Rietputs (where there are also cores with preferential removals)?
Response: A definition for the organized cores is added in the text, which can show their differences
from the VW cores. See page 4.
- It may be preferable to use the word ‘knapping’ instead of ‘shaping’ when speaking about core
preparation.
Response: We have changed the word “shaping” to “knapping”. See pages 7 and 10.
- Write the French “chaîne opératoire” in italics.
Response: We have changed this term to the italics format. See page 12.
- Finally, does the highly standardized nature of these cores really imply a “lack of technological
flexibility” in relation to Levallois technologies or is it indicative of a strongly binding techno-social
tradition?
Response: Here, we still prefer the opinion that there is a lack of technological flexibility when we
compare the Acheulean VW cores with the MSA Levallois cores. Multiple variants of Levallois are
often coexistent in the Middle Stone Age sites, as well as in later Acheulean sites (see Wilkins et al.’s
comparisons). Levallois has been suggested as a defining feature of the MSA. The flexibility of flaking
patterns in MSA does not mean that the techno-social binding in this period was not strong, but just the
reverse. We argue that the difference is related to archaic vs. modern human behavior.
- Figures and table are clear and reference list is commendable.
