The authors aim to propose an online bearing fault diagnosis, however, the content of the paper
did not organise in that way. The content of the paper described a typical bearing faults
classification by multi-dimensional features.
1. The paper aims to solve the problem that the traditional time and frequency domain methods
are not easy to make an accurate assessment of the health status of rolling bearings. However, the
authors did not clearly describe the problems of the traditional time and frequency domain
methods. Is that difficulty in extracting useful information from a noisy or nonlinear vibration
signal? If yes, please compare/cite the renowned researches in this field.
2. Yager algorithm seems to be the main classifier in the bearing faults classification, however, the
description of the Yager algorithm is not available. Please explain how Yager algorithm was
adapted into this study.
3. Partial data was used to develop the model, and remaining data was used to test the model.
Cross-validation such as k-fold cross-validation is recommended to btain an average accuracy
instead of signle accuracy value to test the model ability in actual practical environment.
4. The paper was written in a readable English, but it is not free from grammartical or spelling
error such as healthy status vs. health status. Thus, linguistic assistance may required.

A hybrid method combining Multi-dimensional feature extraction mehtod and gray relation
algorithm (GRA) is proposed to realize rolling bearing fault diagnosis. Actually, these algorithms
have been used by previous researchers for denoising, signal decomposition and envelope
analysis, respectively, which could be found in available literature. All of the algorithms used in
the manuscript are proposed by other researchers. This reviewer could not find any novelty of
the proposed algorithm from the manuscript.

The authors of this manuscript proposed a novel rolling bearing fault diagnostic method, in
which, multi-dimensional features: entropy characteristics, Holder coefficient characteristics and
improved generalized box-counting dimension characteristics were extracted to form the
knowledge base. And secondly a gray relation algorithm was used to acquire basic belief
assignments, and at last the basic belief assignments were fused through Yager algorithm for
achieving bearing fault pattern recognition intelligently. This work has some interesting
innovations and conclusions. In my opinion, it can be accepted after minor revisions. The specific
needs to be revised are as follows:
1 The grammar and some sentences need further modification and improvement.
2 Some sentences are not concise enough.
3 The bearing data from Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Center is too old and
very easy to classify, hence, I suggest a new dataset to illustrate your model.
4 The time cost of the proposed method is 0.016 seconds. It cannot just rely on this to show that
your method is suitable for on-line bearing fault diagnosis.

In the revised manuscript, there seems to be no response to the questions raised before. The
following questions are outstanding.
1. The authors aim to propose an online bearing fault diagnosis. However, the content of the
paper did not organise in that way.
2.According to the extracted features, the good classification results can be achieved by using
Holder coefficients. As shown in Figure 5, Holder coefficients are completely separable under
different operating conditions.
3. From the characteristics of different fault level of severity, the fusion features seem
indistinguishable. Because there is a common overlap and confusion area between the 3
characteristics.

Manuscript title: Research on rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on multi-dimensional feature

Dear editor,
Thank you for your useful comments and suggestions on our manuscript. We have modified the
manuscript accordingly, and the detailed corrections are listed below:
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors aim to propose an online bearing fault diagnosis, however, the content of the paper
did not organise in that way. The content of the paper described a typical bearing faults
classification by multi-dimensional features.
1. The paper aims to solve the problem that the traditional time and frequency domain methods are
not easy to make an accurate assessment of the health status of rolling bearings. However, the
authors did not clearly describe the problems of the traditional time and frequency domain
methods. Is that difficulty in extracting useful information from a noisy or nonlinear vibration
signal? If yes, please compare/cite the renowned researches in this field.
Answer: The background introduction of the paper has been modified, thanks for your advice!
2. Yager algorithm seems to be the main classifier in the bearing faults classification, however, the
description of the Yager algorithm is not available. Please explain how Yager algorithm was
adapted into this study.
Answer: The description of the Yager algorithm has beed added in the paper, thanks for your
advice!
3. Partial data was used to develop the model, and remaining data was used to test the model.
Cross-validation such as k-fold cross-validation is recommended to obtain an average accuracy
instead of signle accuracy value to test the model ability in actual practical environment.
Answer: The modification has been made in the paper.
The diagnostic results from Table 2 show that the detecting success rate for bearing faulty
conditions can reach 100%, with the total fault pattern recognition success rate almost 99.09%
based on a small number of training samples, which shows a certain improvement in diagnostic
accuracy compared with the existing intelligent diagnostic methods from references [33], [34] and
[35]. The time cost of the proposed method through a laptop computer with a 4.0 GHz dual
processor for one Test Case is only 0.016 seconds. The time consumption of the proposed
approach is encouraging, and the proposed method may be suitable for on-line bearing fault
diagnosis. For supplementary verification, the k-fold cross validation is performed for those 550
data samples and the average success rate is 100% for 10-fold cross validation, and the average
success rate is 99.98% for 5-fold cross validation.
4. The paper was written in a readable English, but it is not free from grammartical or spelling
error such as healthy status vs. health status. Thus, linguistic assistance may required.
Answer: The linguistic modification has been made in the paper. Thanks for your advice!
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
A hybrid method combining Multi-dimensional feature extraction mehtod and gray relation
algorithm (GRA) is proposed to realize rolling bearing fault diagnosis. Actually, these algorithms
have been used by previous researchers for denoising, signal decomposition and envelope analysis,
respectively, which could be found in available literature. All of the algorithms used in the
manuscript are proposed by other researchers. This reviewer could not find any novelty of the
proposed algorithm from the manuscript.
Answer: With the development of artificial intelligence, the procedure of rolling bearing fault
diagnosis is more and more treated as a procedure of pattern recognition, and its effectiveness and
reliability mainly depend on the selection of dominant characteristic vector of the fault features. In
the paper, a novel diagnostic framework for rolling bearing faults based on multi-dimensional
feature extraction and evidence fusion theory, is proposed to fulfill the requirements for effective
assessment of different fault types and severities with real-time computational performance.
Fig.1 The diagnostic framework for rolling bearing fault diagnosis
The diagnostic results from Table 2 show that the detecting success rate for bearing faulty
conditions can reach 100%, with the total fault pattern recognition success rate almost 99.09%
based on a small number of training samples, which shows a certain improvement in diagnostic
accuracy compared with the existing intelligent diagnostic methods from references [33], [34] and
[35]. The time cost of the proposed method through a laptop computer with a 4.0 GHz dual

success rate is 99.98% for 5-fold cross validation.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors of this manuscript proposed a novel rolling bearing fault diagnostic method, in which,
multi-dimensional features: entropy characteristics, Holder coefficient characteristics and
improved generalized box-counting dimension characteristics were extracted to form the
knowledge base. And secondly a gray relation algorithm was used to acquire basic belief
assignments, and at last the basic belief assignments were fused through Yager algorithm for
achieving bearing fault pattern recognition intelligently. This work has some interesting
innovations and conclusions. In my opinion, it can be accepted after minor revisions. The specific
needs to be revised are as follows:
1 The grammar and some sentences need further modification and improvement.
Answer: The linguistic modification has been made in the paper. Thanks for your advice!
2 Some sentences are not concise enough.
Answer: The related modification has been made in the paper. Thanks for your advice!
3 The bearing data from Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Center is too old and very
easy to classify, hence, I suggest a new dataset to illustrate your model.
Answer: This bearing database from Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Center is a
classical database, which has been widely used for testing the effectiveness of the proposed
diagnostic methods by researchers, seen in Reference. And in order to comparison with the
existing intelligent diagnostic methods, we used this bearing database to test our proposed method.
Thanks for your advice!
4 The time cost of the proposed method is 0.016 seconds. It cannot just rely on this to show that
your method is suitable for on-line bearing fault diagnosis.
Answer: The expression has been modified as may be suitable for online bearing fault
diagnosis.

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
In the revised manuscript, there seems to be no response to the questions raised before.
The following questions are outstanding.
1.The authors aim to propose an online bearing fault diagnosis. However, the content
of the paper did not organise in that way.
Answer: We have modified our paper title from Research on rolling bearing on-line
fault diagnosis based on multi-dimensional feature extraction and Dempster-shafer
Evidence theory into Research on rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on multi-
dimensional feature extraction and evidence fusion theory so as to fit for the content
of the paper.
2.According to the extracted features, the good classification results can be achieved by
using Holder coefficients. As shown in Figure 5, Holder coefficients are completely
separable under different operating conditions.
Answer: From Fig.4, Fig.5 and Fig.6, the Holder coefficient characteristics show a
better inter-class separation and intra-class polymerization than entropy characteristics
and improved generalized box-counting dimension characteristics extracted from the
bearing vibration signals with different fault types. We have modified this part in paper.
3. From the characteristics of different fault level of severity, the fusion features seem
indistinguishable. Because there is a common overlap and confusion area between the
3 characteristics.
Answer: From Fig.4, Fig.5 and Fig.6, the Holder coefficient characteristics show a
better inter-class separation and intra-class polymerization than entropy characteristics
and improved generalized box-counting dimension characteristics extracted from the
bearing vibration signals with different fault types. However, from Fig.8, Fig.9 and
Fig.10, the improved generalized box-counting dimension characteristics show a better
inter-class separation than entropy characteristics and Holder coefficient characteristics
extracted from the bearing vibration signals with different severities. As entropy
characteristics, Holder coefficient characteristics and improved generalized box-
counting dimension characteristics show their strengths and weaknesses in classifying
different fault types and severities, evidence fusion theory is used to obtain the final
diagnostic results (i.e., fault types and severities) after the fusion of BBAs. We have
modified this part in paper.
Thanks a lot for your advise!
