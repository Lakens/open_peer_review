The manuscript “Optimal Random Search Using Limited Spatial Memory”, by T. Sakiyama and
Y.-P. Gunji, presents an interesting study, related to the foraging problem, that investigates on
how a switching self-avoiding walk (SAW) incremented with some memory rules can give rise to
the power-law distributions of step lengths usually found in foraging behavior by animals.
The article is interesting in part because it unveils this new mechanism (SAW + memory) to
produce the so-called Lévy search walks.
In my opinion, the article deserves publication in the Royal Society Open Science journal.
However, several points must be addressed before the final acceptance, as detailed below.
1. I have reviewed a manuscript by Y.-P. Gunji in another occasion, and noticed the very same
problem with the definition of a Lévy walk that is also found in the present work (around line
51). I therefore, once again, ask the authors not to disseminate this wrong (or, at least, incomplete)
view of this class of random walks. Indeed, the stable Lévy distribution has been long
confounded in the foraging literature with the power-law (also called Pareto) distribution.
Actually, the power-law distribution represents only the long-length asymptotic limit of the Lévy
distribution. I suggest that this point is made clear when the authors generally define the Lévy
walk.
2. The role of memory in foraging is actually one of the most important issues in recent foraging
literature. In this sense, the authors must improve their bibliographic revision. I only cite a few
papers on this matter that should appear in the references (there are, actually, many more):
- O. Olsson, J.S. Brown, The foraging benefits of information and the penalty of ignorance, Oikos
112 (2006) 260–273.

environment on Lévy random search ffficiency: fractality and memory effects, Physica A 391
(2012) 3234-3246.
3. Perhaps my main concern relates to the reality of the model assumptions. Do these
assumptions find some echo in real life? Can the authors provide some reference that justify why,
e.g., a typical foraging animal should avoid a target just visited by some memory mechanism?
Ok, we know that the variety of foraging behaviors in nature is so wide that one can eventually
find a similar rule in some species (e.g., bumblebees). But to what extent this rule represents a
usual behavior?
4. As one point also related to the item 3 above, it has been long known that the mechanism
responsible for the optimal foraging power-law exponent \mu ~ 2 in sparse environments is the
balance between the need to search for previously unvisited regions (favored by \mu ~ 1) and
the detailed scanning of the recently visited targets (favored by \mu ~ 3). In this sense, would the
imposing of the memory length (avoiding targets just found) lead to less efficient searches?
3
5. One of the most interesting mechanisms that have been proposed (in a variety of different
forms) in random searches with memory is the use of the recent memory of visited positions
precisely to remain around regions rich in targets. This can be implemented using diverse rules
(see some articles cited above). However, it seems that the use of the memory length in the
present paper goes in the opposite direction? I mean, if the walker cannot return to the, say, 10
previously visited sites in a plentiful region, would it have to head to presumably poorer faraway
regions, contrarily to the finding of previous works?
6. Some of the works cited above came to an interesting conclusion: a lot of memory not always
can be beneficial to the searcher. Here the authors use only two values of the memory length (10
and 20). If the memory length were much bigger, would they also come to a similar conclusion?
7. The study of the diffusiveness of the search walks in Figs. 3 and 5 is really interesting. I would
suggest the authors to refer to a similar and more complete study (including the analytical
viewpoint) in:
F. Bartumeus, E. P. Raposo, G. M. Viswanathan, M. G. E. da Luz, Stochastic optimal foraging:
Tuning intensive and extensive dynamics in random searches, PLoS ONE 9 (2014) e106373.
8. Finally, what was the actual difference the authors found in changing the memory length from
10 to 20? The Hurst exponent was essentially the same (H~0.7) in both cases. The authors discuss
a little bit in the paragraph of the Discussion section starting with “Next we checked…”. Could
they elaborate more on this issue? Does the change in the memory length imply some qualitative
difference?

This paper looks at how a self-avoiding walk (SAW) might be relevant in (optimal) random
searches. The main result is that if a searcher memorizes previously visited locations, then a
4
tendency to avoid previously visited sites can lead to the type of movement often seen in Levy
walks and flights, with heavy tailed move length distributions.
The idea behind the paper is quite interesting, but in its present form it should not yet be
published in RSOS.
The main weakness of this paper is that the so-called SAW model used in this paper is NOT a
SAW. This is because the model is an n-step Markov process (where it seems n has been chosen to
be proportional to 10, which is the "memory length" parameter). However, a real SAW is non-
Markovian. It makes no sense to think of the model as being inspired in a SAW. Instead, the
model should be described as self-avoiding only of recently visited locations, rather than of every
visited location.
This point is related to a second issue. Since the model is Markovian, it is theoretically impossible
for this model to generate heavy tails. Instead it can generate at most a truncated heavy tail. The
authors should carefully re-write the paper to make such issues more clear.
Once these conceptual errors are corrected, I will be happy to reconsider the paper for publication
in RSOS.
Minor points:
** The theoretical and numerically estimated scaling of the mean squared displacement in 2D
should be cited for the pure SAW.
** Some references have a period "." at the end, other don't. One gets the impression that the
paper has not been carefully proof read by the authors.
** The English can be improved. E.g., in the abstract there is incorrect grammar in the last
sentence.

The authors would like to thank Reviewers very much for the helpful, useful and
constructive comments and suggestions regarding this paper.
------------------------
First of all, I found that some mistakes in the original paper and therefore re-prepared Figure 5A and
5C (=Figure 5B in the original paper) and corrected results of diffusion (the value H in the paper). I
would like to apologize for these errors.

# Reviewer: 1
1. I have reviewed a manuscript by Y.-P. Gunji in another occasion, and noticed the very same
problem with the definition of a Lévy walk that is also found in the present work (around line 51). I
therefore, once again, ask the authors not to disseminate this wrong (or, at least, incomplete) view of

distribution represents only the long-length asymptotic limit of the Lévy distribution. I suggest that
this point is made clear when the authors generally define the Lévy walk.
Response:
I rewrote regarding the explanation of Levy walks as followings.
“A Lévy walk is defined as a process whereby an agent takes steps of length l at each time
and the probability density function of those steps decays asymptotically as a power law:
P(l) ~ l-µ ,
where 1 < µ <U+2266>3.”

Response:
Thank you for your suggestions. I cited above papers.
3. Perhaps my main concern relates to the reality of the model assumptions. Do these assumptions
find some echo in real life? Can the authors provide some reference that justify why, e.g., a typical
foraging animal should avoid a target just visited by some memory mechanism? Ok, we know that
the variety of foraging behaviors in nature is so wide that one can eventually find a similar rule in
some species (e.g., bumblebees). But to what extent this rule represents a usual behavior?
Response:
I cited a study showing animals avoided targets previously visited by them.
“Hurly, T. A. & Healy, S. D. 1996. Memory for flowers in rufous hummingbirds:
location or local visual cues? Animal Behaviour, 51, 1149e2257.”
4. As one point also related to the item 3 above, it has been long known that the mechanism
responsible for the optimal foraging power-law exponent ¥mu ~ 2 in sparse environments is the
balance between the need to search for previously unvisited regions (favored by ¥mu ~ 1) and the
detailed scanning of the recently visited targets (favored by ¥mu ~ 3). In this sense, would the
imposing of the memory length (avoiding targets just found) lead to less efficient searches?
Response:
Setting the parameter memory_length to small value (10) would not be less efficient searches
regarding above problem because the agent can sometimes return to visited targets after a while
when the agent replaced the parameter r with a small value. Please also see my answer to your
question #5.
5. One of the most interesting mechanisms that have been proposed (in a variety of different forms)
in random searches with memory is the use of the recent memory of visited positions precisely to
remain around regions rich in targets. This can be implemented using diverse rules (see some articles
cited above). However, it seems that the use of the memory length in the present paper goes in the
opposite direction? I mean, if the walker cannot return to the, say, 10 previously visited sites in a
plentiful region, would it have to head to presumably poorer faraway regions, contrarily to the
finding of previous works?
Response:
I admit that the agent sometimes heads to presumably poorer faraway regions if it sets the parameter
r to a value close to 1.00. However, the agent can return to visited sites after a while if it sets the
parameter r to a smaller value. Same behaviors occur when the current regions for the agent are
poorer regions, resulting in exploring new areas which might be richer regions. I conducted
additional analysis regarding the return visits of the agent and added Figure S1 and following
sentences to results.
“Figure S1 presents examples obtained from two different trials regarding the relationships between
the time interval of return visits and their frequency. As you can see, the agent in our model
sometimes returns to previously visited sites even though it basically avoids recently visited ones.
The agent in Figure S1A appears to return to recently visited sites whereas the agent in Figure S1B
shows different behaviors; that is, it returns to previously visited sites after a while.”.
Also, following sentences were added to Discussion.
“The important point is that the agent can effectively search wide areas because we do not allow it to
cross the areas that it recently searched. Therefore, the agent might go to new areas effectively if it is
located around regions with a dearth of targets. However, the agent can sometimes return to visited
sites after a while if it sets the parameter r to a smaller value. That is, the agent occasionally stays
around or returns to visited regions, which might provide an opportunity for it to relocate regions
rich in targets.”
6. Some of the works cited above came to an interesting conclusion: a lot of memory not always can
be beneficial to the searcher. Here the authors use only two values of the memory length (10 and 20).
If the memory length were much bigger, would they also come to a similar conclusion?
Response:
I conducted additional analysis by replacing the parameter memory_length with much larger value
(50). We found that super-diffusion disappeared when that parameter was set to larger value. Please
note that the larger values the parameter was set to, less often I could obtain trajectories of the agent
travelling more than 500 time steps. This is why I set that parameter to 50 as a larger value (in this
case, I could not obtain any trials in which the agent travelled more than ~700 time steps from 100
trials).
7. The study of the diffusiveness of the search walks in Figs. 3 and 5 is really interesting. I would
suggest the authors to refer to a similar and more complete study (including the analytical viewpoint)

Response:
I cited above paper and added following sentence to results.
“The diffusiveness of the search walks is one interesting feature to study to analyze search efficiency
(18).”.
8. Finally, what was the actual difference the authors found in changing the memory length from 10
to 20? The Hurst exponent was essentially the same (H~0.7) in both cases. The authors discuss a
little bit in the paragraph of the Discussion section starting with “Next we checked…”. Could they
elaborate more on this issue? Does the change in the memory length imply some qualitative
difference?
Response:
In order to say that a lot of memory cannot always be beneficial to the searcher, I would like to show
that same diffusion property could be maintained even if that parameter was changed to a little bit
longer value. Moreover, I found that much larger value appeared to allow the agent to show
non-super diffusion. I therefore rewrote some sentences regarding the parameter effects in Results as
followings.
“Next, we checked how the parameter Memory_length influenced the agent’s behaviors. Figures 5A
and 5B illustrate the mean squared distance and the time step obtained by replacing Memory_length
= 10 with 20 and 50, respectively (averaged R2 was obtained from 100 trials at each discrete time
step; data were obtained every 50-time steps). The fit for parameter H according to the model above
was H ~ 0.73 (Memory_length = 20) and H ~ 0.56 (Memory_length = 50), indicating that
super-diffusion disappeared when that parameter became larger (R2 = 0.95 and 0.80, respectively).
These findings indicate that the memory capacity of the agent does not need to be high.”.

1. The main weakness of this paper is that the so-called SAW model used in this paper is NOT a
SAW. This is because the model is an n-step Markov process (where it seems n has been chosen to
be proportional to 10, which is the "memory length" parameter). However, a real SAW is
non-Markovian. It makes no sense to think of the model as being inspired in a SAW. Instead, the
model should be described as self-avoiding only of recently visited locations, rather than of every
visited location.
This point is related to a second issue. Since the model is Markovian, it is theoretically impossible
for this model to generate heavy tails. Instead it can generate at most a truncated heavy tail. The
authors should carefully re-write the paper to make such issues more clear.
Response:
I replaced “self-avoiding” with “self-avoiding of recently visited locations”.
I rewrote some sentences in Results as followings.
“Figures 4A and 4B represent the relationship between step length and its cumulative frequency in
each direction. Note that it is theoretically impossible for the switching SAW model of recently
visited locations to generate heavy tails since the model is Markovian. However, power-law tailed
distributions were achieved across some ranges in both directions”.
In addition, I replaced “a power-law/Levy movement” with a power-law/Levy movement across
some ranges” in Abstract, Results and Discussion.
2. The theoretical and numerically estimated scaling of the mean squared displacement in 2D should
be cited for the pure SAW.
Response:
I cited a reference for above suggestion.
“The diffusion of self-avoiding random walk in high dimensions. Commun. Math. Phys., 110:661–
683. [199] G. Slade (1988)”
3. Some references have a period "." at the end, other don't. One gets the impression that the paper
has not been carefully proof read by the authors.
Response:
I corrected the format of references. I appreciate reviewer’s comment.
4. The English can be improved. E.g., in the abstract there is incorrect grammar in the last sentence.
Response:
Revised version of manuscript has been proofed by a native English speaker.
