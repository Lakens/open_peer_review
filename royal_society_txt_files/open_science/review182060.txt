1, At P17 ln23-41, the authors concluded that the cell distribution and proliferation was affected
by the dispersion of HAP in PMMA. In Figure 2, the authors only showed the SEM images at low
magnification. It is very hard for readers to distinguish the morphology differences of Figure 2A,
D, E and F. Authors should also provide the enlarged SEM images to support the above
conclusions.
2, The highlight of this manuscript is that the improved nHA dispersion can promote the cell
affinity, proliferation, differentiation, and connection to the surrounding bone tissue. The
manuscript mainly showed the experiment results. The underlying reasons should be deeply
discussed with review of related literature.

The manuscript has been well revised. However, the cell culturing results seemed not consistent
as shown in Figure 4, 5 and 6. The authors are suggested to conduct cell culturing experiments
again and give the results at day 1, 3, 5 and 7.
In addition, please explain the details of ANOVA method for comparison between each group as
shown in Figure 3 and 7.

RESPONSES TO REVIEWERS’S COMMENTS
Thank you very much for your time and giving us chance to be considered for
publication after minor revision. As shown below, we have addressed the reviewers’
concerns, including the minor concerns and statistical analysis, point-by-point and
have revised our original manuscript in keeping with reviewer points taken. Please
let us know if there is anything else that we should address with respect to this
manuscript.

1, At P17 ln23-41, the authors concluded that the cell distribution and proliferation was
affected by the dispersion of HAP in PMMA. In Figure 2, the authors only showed the
SEM images at low magnification. It is very hard for readers to distinguish the
morphology differences of Figure 2A, D, E and F. Authors should also provide the
enlarged SEM images to support the above conclusions.
RESPONSE:
We agree with you that it is hard for reader to distinguish the differences of Figure 2A, D,
E and F. We have replaced with new SEM images to make the point clearer. SEM was
used to observe HAP, which is 200 nm. If HAP aggregates together, the size will become
larger and present as bright spots on the SEM image. Thus, some bright spots were
significantly observed on the surface of PMMAn10 and PMMAn20 tablets (Figure
2A,B). The bright spot on the surface of PMMAn20 were confirmed for the composition
containing calcium and phosphate using EDX analysis (Figure 2C). Conversely, there
were fewer bright spots observed on the surfaces of PMMAg10 and PMMAg20 (Figure
2D,E), which indicates that no significant particle agglomeration occurred in these two
tablets. Plain PMMA surface are also presented for comparison and had smooth surfaces
with some small dots.
2, The highlight of this manuscript is that the improved nHAP dispersion can promote the
cell affinity, proliferation, differentiation, and connection to the surrounding bone tissue.
The manuscript mainly showed the experiment results. The underlying reasons should be
deeply discussed with review of related literature.
RESPONSE:
Really appreciated for your kindly suggestion. We have added some discussion about the
correlation between HAP dispersion and cell growth as below and this discussion is also
added in the final paragraph on the page 17-18.
“Kim et al. have reported that cell proliferation of mouse fibroblast is significantly
enhanced on 24 wt.% PCL grafted HAP nano-composites compared to the PCL only
because of excellent dispersion [31]. Keivani et al. have demonstrated that even addition
of 7 wt.% PCL grafted HAP nanoparticles to PCL is enough to significantly increase cell
proliferation of fibroblast as well [32]. Corresponding to our study, 10-20 wt.% PCL-
grafted EC HAP (gHAP) remarkably improves the HAP dispersion in PMMA and
enhances cell proliferation of osteoblast compared to nHAP nanoparticles. Thus, these
literatures suggest that cell proliferation property of nano-composites is greatly
influenced by the HAP dispersion.”

Comments to the Author(s)
1) The manuscript has been well revised. However, the cell culturing results seemed not
consistent as shown in Figure 4, 5 and 6. The authors are suggested to conduct cell
culturing experiments again and give the results at day 1, 3, 5 and 7.
RESPONSE:
Thank you very much for your suggestion. The previous descriptions maybe not clear
enough. We have pointed out the different experimental condition of Figure 4, 5 and 6.
(a) In Figure 4 and 5, cells were seeded on the composites for 1 day and then assayed
by Live & Dead staining and CCK-8, respectively. These results indicate the cell
attachment on the composites. In Figure 6, we cultured cells on the composites for
3 days and then observed cell morphology and cell number by SEM.
(b) The magnification of image is higher in Figure 6 compare to Figure 4.
The data show that cell attachment is slightly different between nHAP/PMMA
and gHAP/PMMA groups but lower in PMMA only (Figure 4, 5); however, after
3-day incubation, cell proliferation is significantly upregulated on gHAP/PMMA
composite with better dispersion, but not on nHAP/PMMA and PMMA only.
From these data, cell culturing for 3 day on composites is enough to observe the
difference of cell proliferation between gHAP/PMMA and nHAP/PMMA.
2) In addition, please explain the details of ANOVA method for comparison between
each group as shown in Figure 3 and 7.
RESPONSE:
Thank you very much for kindly pointing out this typo. In Figure 3 and 7, we use
unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test to compare two groups. We have modified the
description in “Material and Method<U+F0E0> Statistical Analysis” on the page 11:
“Statistical analysis and the results are shown as the mean ± SD. Significant differences
were evaluated by using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. The level of statistically
significant was set at p < 0.05. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.”
