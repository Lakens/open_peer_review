1. The authors must showcase their benchmarks are robust and trust worthy. This can be done
by:
1a. The authors should analyze a randomized chemical structure space. Ie feed the SVM model
compounds that do not exists or is likely unknown. This would give a very conservative
assessment of performance.
1b. The authors should ensure to reduce their chemical structure space based on redundancy. Ie
similar structures should be removed in order to avoid the test set is biased and thus
overassement of performance is the result.
1c. The authors should ensure they keep part of their training set completely out of the training
and strictly use it for evaluation of the SVM models.
2. The authors should describe how their models are supported by known protein structures. Can
they explain their predictions from a mechanistic point of view?
3. The authors should compare directly with other methods using the same data for those cases

This paper describes an in silico method for screening of small molecules for targeting specific
protein-protein interactions. The publication describes an associated website which appears

effective and relatively simple to use, according to the examples. I would like to make the
following suggestions:
1. The paper describes an in silico example validated by a second in silico method. However,
many of the compounds in the training set are described in the ChEMBL database with associated
IC50 data. For those compounds for which a valid SAR can be accessed, it would be interesting to
see how this correlates with the order predicted by the algorithm of the effectiveness of these
molecules as inhibitors of particular protein complexes.
2. A number of specific PPIMs which have been clinically tested are described at the start of the
manuscript. It may the value of this methodology clearer to the user if the results of these
examples when run through the algorithm (Nutlin 3a (Mdm2/P53), ABT-263 (Bcl2/Bak), MI-269,
and GX15-070 (c-Myc/Max) are described in full in the main manuscript.

The authors still need to conduct the analysis asked for. Namely of a randomized chemical
database. They should randomize the structures they input to the algorithm in order to get a
baseline or background performance metric. They have not conducted a randomized trial, only
repeated their analysis on a larger database.

The authors should repeat their analysis at 90% and 80% cutoffs for chemical structure similarity
and report their performance metrics at these levels. They currently only report at exclusion of

You can expect to receive a proof of your article in the near future. Please contact the editorial
office (openscience_proofs@royalsociety.org and openscience@royalsociety.org) to let us know if
you are likely to be away from e-mail contact. Due to rapid publication and an extremely tight

Response to the queries raised by the referees
thank the reviewers for their careful assessment of the manuscript. We have done
re work and revised manuscript as suggested by the reviewers. In the revised
nuscript we have shown that predicted SVM scores matches reasonably well with IC50
ues of known small chemical modulators of Mdm2/P53 and Bcl2/Bak in training sets.
e prediction of the PPIMs to known protein structures were studied from structural point
iew and it was observed the predicted small chemical modulators bind to same groove
known protein structures of Mdm2 and Bcl2. In addition, we have shown that the
dicted SVM scores also match well with the docking scores of known small chemical
dulators against Mdm2/P53 and Bcl2/Bak complexes. All the associated figures and
les were reported in supplementary information. As suggested, the SVM scores of
wn clinically tested PPIMs of Mdm2/P53 and Bcl2/Bak were reported in the
nuscript. We have used the structural clustering of positive small chemical protein-
tein interaction modulator datasets of all the three complexes to make sure that no two
micals have identical structures in training and testing sets.

mments to the Author(s)
The authors must showcase their benchmarks are robust and trust worthy.
s can be done by:
The authors should analyze a randomized chemical structure space. Ie feed
SVM model compounds that do not exists or is likely unknown. This would
e a very conservative assessment of performance.
sponse: We thank the reviewer for the critical comments and suggestions. We have
ted the SVM models on large chemical dataset from National Cancer Institute
abase as mentioned in pages 6 (line nos.1-4) and 12 (line nos. 1-23).
The authors should ensure to reduce their chemical structure space based on
undancy. Ie similar structures should be removed in order to avoid the test set
biased and thus over assessment of performance is the result.
sponse: We have performed structure clustering analysis on the positive datasets
itive datasets of Mdm2/P53, Bcl2/Bak, and c-Myc/Max consisted of 250, 735 and 15
all molecules respectively. We observed that no two chemicals were 100% identical
ach positive datasets as mentioned in the revised version, page 5 (line nos. 6-8).
The authors should ensure they keep part of their training set completely out
the training and strictly use it for evaluation of the SVM models.
sponse: We have used 20% of the positive datasets for three case studies as blind
asets, which was not used in training (pages 5, line nos. 18-22. The performance of
M on the blind dataset is reported in the revised version (page 11, line nos. 11-19).
The authors should describe how their models are supported by known protein
uctures. Can they explain their predictions from a mechanistic point of view?
sponse: We have addressed this point in the revised version (page 11, line nos. 3-
and included supplementary Figures S7 (a and b). By docking studies it was shown
t the small chemicals with high SVM scores bind to the same groove of MDM2 and
2 structures.
The authors should compare directly with other methods using the same data
those cases they are available.
sponse: We have used 2P2I dataset (page 6 line no. 6) in our SVM models and the
formance is reported in the revised version (13, line nos. 1-16)

ticular protein complexes.
sponse: We thank the reviewer for the comments which eventually helped us to
engthen the manuscript scientifically. We have performed the analysis of IC50 value
d SVM scores of known chemicals from training sets as reported in the revised
