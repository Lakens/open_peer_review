The manuscript describes the removal of elemental mercury Hg<sup>0</sup> vapor from
simulated flue gas using silver-loaded rice husk gasification char (SRHGC). The adsorbent
SRHGC can be easily prepared from an industrial waste of biomass gasification power
generation. In this study, the rice husk gasification char (RHGC)-type adsorbents were
characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy, and then
used for the Hg<sup>0</sup> removal. The authors widely examined the effects of various
adsorption parameters such as silver-loading, inlet concentration of mercury, adsorption
temperature, and gas composition on the Hg<sup>0</sup> adsorption. The prepared adsorbent,
SRHGC, is effective for the removal of Hg<sup>0</sup> in the flue gas. However, there are
several issues with the current manuscript. Therefore, I recommend the acceptance after major
revisions. The reviewer provides some more detailed questions and comments as follows:
1. The authors should describe the experimental conditions including the mercury concentration,
adsorption temperature, adsorption time and so on in the Figure captions.
2. Did you confirm that the reproducibility of the experimental data is sufficient? There are no
error bars in the data in Figures.
3. Is it possible to show the evidence of the formation of Hg(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,
HgCl<sub>2</sub>, HgSO<sub>4</sub> and silver amalgam?
4. What is the reason why the Hg<sup>0</sup> adsorption capacity of the SRHGC decreased
significantly at the sixth adsorption–regeneration cycle?
5. The authors should compare this Hg<sup>0</sup> removal method with the conventional
methods or other methods.
6. Does the adsorption efficiency change with the gas flow rate?
Minor points:
1. The character “°C” is garbled.
2. In the description of equation 3.2, m is duplicated.
3. It is difficult to see the peaks and elements in the EDS spectrum (Figure 3b).
4. The word “Hg<sup>0</sup> removal efficiency” at line 1 on page 8 is not suitable. It should
be changed to “Hg<sup>0</sup> adsorption capacity” or other suitable word.
5. The word “adsorption curves” at line 39 on page 8 is strange.
6. What is the y axis in Figure 7? Probably Hg<sup>0</sup> adsorption capacity (µg/g).

comments as follows:
1. The authors should describe the experimental conditions including
the mercury concentration, adsorption temperature, adsorption time
and so on in the Figure captions.
Reply: Thanks for the reviewer’s comment. This is an
excellent suggestion. To address this comment, we have added the
experimental conditions in the Figure captions, as follows:
Figure. 4. Breakthrough curve of mercury adsorption of RHGC
and SRHGC in pure N2. The experimental conditions: adsorption
temperature was about 160 <U+2103>, flue gas flow rate was 0.003 m3/min,
mercury inlet concentration was about 38.6 µg/m3, the adsorption time
was 120 minutes.
Figure. 5. Effect of mercury inlet concentration on Hg0 adsorption
capacity of SRHGC.The experimental conditions: adsorption
temperature was about 160 <U+2103>, flue gas flow rate was 0.003 m3/min,
the adsorption time was 120 minutes.
Figure. 6. Effect of adsorption temperature on the Hg0 adsorption
capacity of SRHGC.The experimental conditions: flue gas flow rate
was 0.003 m3/min, mercury inlet concentration was about 38.6 µg/m3,
the adsorption time was 120 minutes.
Figure. 7. Effect of different gas compositions on the Hg0
adsorption capacity of SRHGC. The experimental conditions:
adsorption temperature was about 160 <U+2103>, flue gas flow rate was 0.003
m3/min, mercury inlet concentration was about 38.6 µg/m3, the
adsorption time was 120 minutes.
Figure. 8. Adsorption-regeneration cycles of SRHGC. The
experimental conditions: adsorption temperature was about 350 <U+2103>,
flue gas flow rate was 0.003 m3/min, mercury inlet concentration was
about 38.6 µg/m3, the adsorption time was 120 minutes.
2. Did you confirm that ? There are no error bars in the data in
Figures.
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. Before the adsorption
experiment began, we made blank experiments and calibrated the
experimental apparatus. In this paper, we performed three sets of
repetitive experiments, the experimental results were basically same.
So the the reproducibility of the experimental data is sufficient.
3. Is it possible to show the evidence of the formation of
Hg(NO<sub>3</sub>) <sub>2</sub>,
HgCl<sub>2</sub>, HgSO<sub>4</sub> and silver
amalgam?
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. According to the
current experimental setup in our laboratory, it is not possible to show
the evidence of the formation of Hg(NO3)2, HgCl2, HgSO4 and silver
amalgam, these products are our predictions, and some of them are
also mentioned in literature, such as [43-46].

4. What is the reason why the Hg<sup>0</sup> adsorption capacity
of the SRHGC decreased significantly at the sixth adsorption–
regeneration cycle?
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. Due to the heating for
four times of adsorption–regeneration cycle, the surface of
silver-loaded rice husk gasification char (SRHGC) is coked, causing
structural changes, in addition, the specific surface area of the
adsorbent is lowered due to the aggregation of a part of the nano silver
particles, so the adsorption capacity of the SRHGC decreased
significantly at the sixth adsorption–regeneration cycle.
5. The authors should compare this Hg<sup>0</sup> removal
method with the conventional methods or other methods.
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. This paper is part of
my doctoral thesis. The literature showed that carbon-based adsorbents
modified by halogen elements have high mercury removal efficiency.
In the dissertation, we used the halogen element to modify RHGC.
Using 300mg 3% ZnCl2, KBr and KI modified RHGC, labeled as
RHGCCl, RHGCBr and RHGCI, respectively. Comparing Hg0
adsorption capacity of SRHGC, RHGCCl, RHGCBr and RHGCI.
Each adsorbent was 300mg, adsorption temperature was about 160 <U+2103>,
flue gas flow rate was 0.003 m3/min, mercury inlet concentration was
about 38.6 µg/m3, the adsorption time was 120 minutes, Hg0
adsorption capacity of RHGCCl, RHGCBr , RHGCI and SRHGC was
44.6µg/g, 46.2µg/g, 46.7µg/g, 44.2µg/g, Hg0 adsorption capacity of
RHGC modified by halogen element was higher than SRHGC'S, but
RHGCCl, RHGCBr and RHGCI could not be regenerated after
Hg<sup>0</sup> removal. Therefore, the advantage of SRHGC was
obvious. The result was shown in Figure1.
Figure 1. Hg0 adsorption capacity of SRHGC, RHGCCl, RHGCBr and
RHGCI
6. Does the adsorption efficiency change with the gas flow rate?
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. In the ideal gas state, we
did three sets of experiments with different gas flow gradients, the
adsorption efficiency is basically same. In fact, the flue gas of the
coal-fired power plant has impurities, the gas flow rate will effect the
adsorption efficiency.
Minor points:
1. The character “°C” is garbled.
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. We have modified “°C”
to the correct form.
2. In the description of equation 3.2, m is duplicated.
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. We have deleted the extra.
3. It is difficult to see the peaks and elements in the EDS spectrum
(Figure 3b).
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. We have repainted Figure
3b.
4. The word “Hg<sup>0</sup> removal efficiency” at line 1 on page
8 is not suitable. It should be changed to “Hg<sup>0</sup>
adsorption capacity” or other suitable word.
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. The word “Hg0 removal
efficiency” is not suitable, we have changed “Hg0 removal efficiency”
to “Hg0 adsorption capacity”.
5. The word “adsorption curves” at line 39 on page 8 is strange.
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. The word “adsorption
curves” is not suitable, we have changed “adsorption curves” to
“adsorption capacity”.
6. What is the y axis in Figure 7? Probably Hg<sup>0</sup> .
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. The y axis is Hg0
adsorption capacity (µg/g) in Figure 7, we also have modified Figure 7.

Abstract: Good
1. Introduction/problem statement: The authors did not mentioned the
specific objective in this article.
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. We have added the
description of specific objective: using an industrial waste from the
biomass gasification power plant and loading silver on it, investigating
the mercury removal performance and regeneration performance of
SRHGC.
2. Materials and methods:
In adsorbent preparation, the result of elemental analyzer, pore
structure should put in result and discussion. The reasoning behind the
test also not mentioned. Please mention the purity of chemical you
used. Explain why need to adjust pH to 9.7 in your study?
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. C is an excellent
adsorbent for Hg0. The high carbon content of SRHGC provides an
important basis for the removal of Hg0. The O element content is
21.82%, which is second only to the element C, a large number of O
and C elements will form C-O and C=O oxygen-containing functional
groups, which have strong oxidative properties and will play a key role
in promoting Hg0 removal.
Mesoporous is the molecular channel of the adsorbed material. Under
the certain relative pressure, , the gas is adsorbed into the pore through
the mechanism of agglomeration to achieve a good adsorption effect.
In order to determine whether RHGC can be used as Hg0 removal
adsorbent by measuring the elemental content and pore structure
parameters of RHGC.
hydrochloric acid (purity:20%), AgNO3 (purity:97%),
ammonia(purity:97%)
When the pH is 9.7, the amount of ammonia added can just dissolve
the AgOH precipitate completely, so it needed to adjust pH to 9.7, the
reaction equations as followed:
AgNO3+NH3·H2O<U+2192>AgOH<U+2193>+NH4NO3
AgOH+2NH3·H2O<U+2192>Ag(NH3)2OH+2H2O
Using 300mg SRHGC as adsorbents, adsorption temperature... (put in
experimental setup)
Reply: This is an excellent suggestion.We have added the
description in experimental setup as follows: Using 300mg SRHGC as
adsorbents, adsorption temperature was about 160 <U+2103>, flue gas flow
rate was 0.003 m3/min, mercury inlet concentration was about 38.6
µg/m3, the adsorption time was 120 minutes.
A constant flow rate (mentioned the value) m is adsorbent quality or
the mass of sorbent (g) ?
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. Here m is the mass of
sorbent (g), we have deleted the extra.
Results and Discussion:
a) Characterization of sorbents - The authors did not mention in
method that they used XPS, SEM and EDS. Please correlate your
result with your method. In each figure, the authors should naming it.
Figure 3 (b) not clear.
Reply: This is an excellent suggestion. We have added these
in method as followed: Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS)
and Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive
Spectrometer (SEM-EDS) to characterize RHGC.
We have named each figure in this paper and repainted Figure 3(b).
b) The Hg0 removal efficiency of adsorbents-strong your finding from
previous researchers. In discussion for figure 7, please state the no of
figure. Recommendation: For example, figure 7 (1-3) represent the
effect of NO. Figure 7 (4-7) regarding SO2.
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. Figure 7 (1) represent
the effect of pure N2, Figure 7 (2-4) regarding NO, Figure 7 (5-7)
regarding SO2, Figure 7 (8-10) regarding HCl, Figure 7 (11) regarding
simulated flue gas.
There are no details on adsorption-regeneration cycles of the SRHGC.
Please include the specified regarding regeneration process.
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. We have added the
details on adsorption-regeneration cycles of the SRHGC: SRHGC was
300mg, the adsorption temperature was about 160 <U+2103>, flue gas flow
rate was 0.003 m3/min, mercury inlet concentration was about 38.6
µg/m3, the adsorption time was 120 minutes, we have added the the
regeneration temperature was 350 <U+2103>. After adsorption for 2h, switched
to the regeneration pipeline, when the mercury analyzer showed that
the mercury concentration was below 3.86µg/m3, switched back to the
adsorption pipeline, circulated the operation, calculated Hg0
adsorption capacity, the number of regeneration was judged by Hg0
adsorption capacity, the adsorbent was cooled to room temperature for
reuse after regeneration.
We highly appreciate your help and support.
