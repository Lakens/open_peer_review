NOTE: I think formatting doesn't appear here, so I've attached my review as a separate PDF.
This paper presents a very original study -- which I believe is the first of its kind -- to study the
brain activation of people viewing prehistoric engravings. The authors found similarity between
how the brain views engravings and pictures of nameable objects. The topic is very innovative
and as such, it does not have any precedents to follow. Therefore, the approach had to be created
by the authors. While they combine archaeological background and neuroscience background,
they use methods from both disciplines but the combination is new, and thus the way they
created the stimuli for the experiments has no comparison in previous literature.
The methodology for neuroimaging follows standard protocols (as for example ones I've used in
my previous work), so I believe the experimental design is sound. The choice of stimuli using a
scrambled version of each stimulus category is excellent.
In the introduction (page 3), the authors state "If the abstract patterns intentionally engraved by
hominins were perceived as structured forms, with a potential meaning, their perception should
engage the ventral route cortex". Here I wondered what's the opposite hypothesis? Would it be
that the ventral route is NOT engaged? Or would another network be more active?
The first major thing I think is missing in this paper is some discussion about symbolism in
hominins. As these results have great implications for the topic, there should be more discussion
about it. At least readers should be given a brief introduction to the debates, with some key
references. It would be a shame to exclude it because it's what makes this paper so original. It is
crucial to define "symbols or icons", a term that's used several times in the paper.
My second main point is that I feel the conclusion is too strong given the lack of discussion about
it. "Our findings support the hypothesis that these engraved patterns were used by human
cultures of the past to store and transmit coded information" (page 12-13)...... "We conclude that
they were probably used as icons or symbols by both modern and archaic hominins."
This paper doesn't contain any discussion of all the big debates around the topic of symbolic
capacity in hominins (of which the last author is an expert), therefore the authors cannot make
this kind of strong conclusion. The fMRI results themselves (which is all that's discussed in the
paper) give only one element of data to this hypothesis. Instead, I suggest to reword as "Our
fMRI results lend an element of support to the hypothesis that these engravings could have been
used as icons or symbols by both modern and archaic hominins, as was previously suggested by
other work (+ cite several references)". Hominin symbolism papers should be mentioned in order
to give readers enough background to appreciate the paper, including readers from both
archaeology and neuroscience, whether they are familiar with the topic or not.
This issue is related to the archaeological engravings that were chosen, as they are listed in Table
S1 - the prehistoric engravings which were used as stimuli contain an extremely wide range of
types, eras, styles, geographic origins.... What makes us think we can judge them all the same?
Maybe some were used as symbols or some were not. It would be useful to provide images of
3
what these look like - they could be very different visually, and if they are not visually
standardized like the other stimuli, this variation would need to be addressed in the discussion.
Thirdly, I think readers should be told more explicitly about the importance of this study, since
it's really a first-time study (wow!!) and it makes a big contribution to 2 disciplines. The authors
are too modest and they should make more of that!
On page 9, I might have missed it, but what statistical test was used to compute the first
correlation "of their activation profiles in 10 regions, compared to their scrambled version, was
computed in each hemisphere separately for each subject."?
Also on page 9, "Then, the resulting Pearson’s correlation coefficients of each subject were Fisher
z-transformed and analysed using a univariate t-test that was significant in both the left (t(25) =
7.6, p < 0.0001) and right (t(25) = 4.8, p < 0.0001) hemispheres. This finding confirms that both
Engravings and object perception recruit the ventral pathway in a similar way in both
hemispheres." Where are these data, please? I perhaps missed them in the text?
METHODS
Several elements of detail are missing from the Methods.
On page 13, "The pictures of objects (256 * 256 pixels) were represented by/consisted of nameable
human-made artefacts" Were these pictures taken from a database or created? How was their
nameability validated?
On page 15, "Each of the 15 stimuli within a block was displayed for 300 ms, including two
repetitions, and the participants were asked to detect the stimuli." How did participants
respond? By button press? Was their accuracy of response recorded?
Figure 2 - I very much like this figure because it shows clearly the different areas with color
codes. But the error bars are very wide in most cases, so this figure makes me wonder if the
Engravings are maybe not so similar to Objects..... the statistics are more convincing.
REF. 8 is missing Author name.
Abstract - hominins is twice misspelled (with M).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
Mellet and colleagues conducted a study to test whether Palaeolithic engravings elicits similar
representations in the visual pathway to objects and this similarity was indeed found. There is
only one engraving shown in the paper (there should be more shown) and based on this one
example these engravings look like complex shapes. Therefore, I don’t see any reason why they
would not elicit responses in visual regions, even the ones higher in the hierarchy, as complex
shapes have been shown to elicit responses in these regions. Therefore, I find this question not
very novel. I could understand an added value of testing the actual engravings but I can’t even
evaluate them as they are not shown in the manuscript or in supplementary material. In general,
there is not enough information in the manuscript to fully evaluate it and the unreadability of
some of the figures makes it hard to evaluate the findings.
I see several issues with this manuscript that I would invite the authors to address.
1. As previously mentioned the stimuli of the engravings are not shown and that seems to be
crucial for understanding the value of this paper. Other stimuli classes are also not shown and the
authors do not state what categories the objects were sampled from and what words were used.
All this information is important for this paper.
2. Why stimulus time presentation is not the same for objects, scenes, and words, and for
engravings (300ms vs 200 ms)? If they are being directly compared as few parameters as possible
should differ between the conditions.
3. It is not enough to say O3-1 and O3-2 correspond LO. To make this claim the authors should
show an overlap of these regions using a LO mask from for example Wang atlas.
4. Different ROIs should be discussed more. It is not enough to say that 10 ROIs elicit a given
response pattern. It is important to discuss more what these regions are implicated in and why
the result makes sense. The authors try this procedure for LO, however, even there they discuss
only a part of the picture. The authors say that “LO is sensitive to the shape, but not the
semantics”. There is a body of literature that claims otherwise and this should be also discussed.
5. The authors partly acknowledge that they can’t claim that these engravings elicited similar
patterns of responses as objects in early humans. However, this should be stressed more. The fact
that the visual cortex did not expand that much during the evolution does not mean that the
visual representations in the cortex in early humans and people nowadays were the same. A
[potentially stronger argument could be that the visual representations in humans and macaque
monkeys are similar and therefore it is likely that the visual representations of early humans were
similar, however, we can’t explicitly test that.
6. Resolution of figures is not acceptable in the paper. I can’t even read the values on the y-axis of
Figure 2 and therefore comment on the results.
7. Labels should be added in panels B and D in Figure 3 as otherwise the dots are not readable.
5
Minor comments:
1. Table 1 could be presented in a color-coded way to enable rapid detection of significant values,
e.g., significant values colored in green.
2. The header should be “funding” not “fundings”, as the latter word does not exist in the English
language.

ment: This paper presents a very original study -- which I believe is the first of its kind -- to study the brain
ation of people viewing prehistoric engravings. The authors found similarity between how the brain views
avings and pictures of nameable objects. The topic is very innovative and as such, it does not have any
edents to follow. Therefore, the approach had to be created by the authors. While they combine
aeological background and neuroscience background, they use methods from both disciplines but the
bination is new, and thus the way they created the stimuli for the experiments has no comparison in previous
ture. The methodology for neuroimaging follows standard protocols (as for example ones I've used in my
ious work), so I believe the experimental design is sound. The choice of stimuli using a scrambled version of
stimulus category is excellent.
er: We thank the reviewer for this positive comment.
ment: In the introduction (page 3), the authors state "If the abstract patterns intentionally engraved by
inins were perceived as structured forms, with a potential meaning, their perception should engage the ventral
e cortex". Here I wondered what's the opposite hypothesis? Would it be that the ventral route is NOT
ged? Or would another network be more active?
er: Most of the engravings have a very simple structure, limited to a few lines, sometimes intertwined,
etimes parallel. This relatively simple organization may have not been sufficiently different from the scrambled
on to elicit areas along the ventral route. In this case, no activation would have been highlighted by the
raving - scramble" contrast. Another possibility would have been to find a significant difference between the
al engravings and their scrambled version only in the primary visual cortex, as hypothesized by some authors.
act that the ventral pathway is activated suggests that the engravings are not perceived as a collection of
le elements but as coherent graphic entities. We conclude that this is a necessary condition for a meaning to
tached to it and for it to be a vector of information.
troduce the alternative hypothesis, we added the following paragraph in the introduction section (highlighted
d in the revised version of the manuscript): “The relatively simple organization that characterizes the earliest
avings may be perceived as not being sufficiently different from the scrambled version and may therefore not
ge differently brain visual regions. In this case, no activation will be highlighted by the "engraving minus
mbled engravings" contrast. Another possibility is that the difference does not involve the ventral cortex but just
rimary visual area. This cortical region has been hypothesized to have played a crucial role in the production of
arliest engravings (Hodgson, 2006; Hodgson, 2014).”
ment: The first major thing I think is missing in this paper is some discussion about symbolism in hominins. As
e results have great implications for the topic, there should be more discussion about it. At least readers should
ven a brief introduction to the debates, with some key references. It would be a shame to exclude it because
hat makes this paper so original. It is crucial to define "symbols or icons", a term that's used several times in
aper.
er: We have considerably enlarged the introduction section and added a number of key references to present
urrent debate on the emergence of symbolic material culture. We have also introduced at the beginning of
ection the notion of symbol and provided a definition.
ment: My second main point is that I feel the conclusion is too strong given the lack of discussion about it.
findings support the hypothesis that these engraved patterns were used by human cultures of the past to
and transmit coded information" (page 12-13)...... "We conclude that they were probably used as icons or
1
ols by both modern and archaic hominins."
paper doesn't contain any discussion of all the big debates around the topic of symbolic capacity in hominins
hich the last author is an expert), therefore the authors cannot make this kind of strong conclusion. The fMRI
ts themselves (which is all that's discussed in the paper) give only one element of data to this
thesis. Instead, I suggest to reword as "Our fMRI results lend an element of support to the hypothesis that
e engravings could have been used as icons or symbols by both modern and archaic hominins, as was
iously suggested by other work (+ cite several references)". Hominin symbolism papers should be mentioned in
r to give readers enough background to appreciate the paper, including readers from both archaeology and
oscience, whether they are familiar with the topic or not.
er: We have focused the discussion on the fMRI results in order to limit over-interpretations and avoid
hing conclusions based on controversial hypotheses proposed by researchers working in other disciplines
er than on our own results. The state of the debate and the ambiguities implicit in the interpretation of the
aeological record are now presented in the introduction section and we think there is no point in reinjecting
again in the discussion. However, we have softened the conclusion, as suggested by the reviewer. The
ence now reads:
ough our results do not allow us to reach definitive conclusions on the nature of these representations, they
ort for the first time with experimental data the hypothesis that they have been used as icons or symbols by
early modern and archaic hominins, as suggested in previous works (d’Errico, 2003; Henshilwood et al., 2009;
íguez-Vidal et al., 2014; Villa and Roebroeks, 2014; Majkic et al., 2017; Majkic et al., 2018)”
ment: This issue is related to the archaeological engravings that were chosen, as they are listed in Table S1 -
rehistoric engravings which were used as stimuli contain an extremely wide range of types, eras, styles,
raphic origins.... What makes us think we can judge them all the same? Maybe some were used as symbols or
e were not. It would be useful to provide images of what these look like - they could be very different visually,
f they are not visually standardized like the other stimuli, this variation would need to be addressed in the
ssion.
er: The images of all the engravings are now presented in the supplementary material.
ment: Thirdly, I think readers should be told more explicitly about the importance of this study, since it's really
t-time study (wow!!) and it makes a big contribution to 2 disciplines. The authors are too modest and they
ld make more of that!
er: We have added a sentence in the introduction section in which we underline the novelty of the study.
report here the first attempt to shed light on the function of Paleolithic engravings by mapping the brain
ns involved in their perception”.
ment: On page 9, I might have missed it, but what statistical test was used to compute the first correlation "of
activation profiles in 10 regions, compared to their scrambled version, was computed in each hemisphere
rately for each subject."?
er: In that section, we raise the question as to whether there a significant relationship between the profile of
ation during engravings and objects perception when individual variability is considered. We first computed a
son’s correlation between these two profiles of activation in each subject. This produced 26 x 2 hemispheres
son’s r coefficients (one per participant and per hemisphere). No statistical test were performed at this stage
the distribution of r coefficient does not allow to use a parametric test (see below).
ment: Also on page 9, "Then, the resulting Pearson’s correlation coefficients of each subject were Fisher z-
formed and analysed using a univariate t-test that was significant in both the left (t(25) = 7.6, p < 0.0001) and
(t(25) = 4.8, p < 0.0001) hemispheres. This finding confirms that both Engravings and object perception recruit
entral pathway in a similar way in both hemispheres." Where are these data, please? I perhaps missed them in
ext?

er: The Fisher-z transformation of the r coefficients allows to perform a univariate t-test on the z-scores to
ss whether they significantly differed from zero in average. We did not include the 52 z-scores in the results but
the result of the t-test for each hemisphere. In the revised version of the manuscript we added the mean and
dard deviation for the two hemispheres (left hemisphere: mean z= 0.84, SD=0.56, right hemisphere mean z=
SD=0.58).

ral elements of detail are missing from the Methods.
ment: On page 13, "The pictures of objects (256 * 256 pixels) were represented by/consisted of nameable
an-made artefacts" Were these pictures taken from a database or created? How was their nameability
ated?
onse: The objects and scenes stimuli were kindly provided by another team and come from previous published
es (Kauffmann et al., 2015) (Roux-Sibilon et al., 2018) (Kauffmann et al, 2015, Roux-Sibilon et al, 2018). The
res come from the Microsoft database and are now included in the supplementary material. In the revised
on of the manuscript we add the references of these studies. Although nameability was not formally evaluated
hosen objects fall in easily namable categories.
ments: On page 15, "Each of the 15 stimuli within a block was displayed for 300 ms, including two repetitions,
he participants were asked to detect the stimuli." How did participants respond? By button press? Was their
racy of response recorded?
onse: Yes, the participants responded by button press each time a stimulus was repeated. The accuracy was
rded. It was 86.4 % (SD 9.9%) of correct detections for the engravings and 81.9% (SD 10.7%) for the average of
cts, scenes and words. We have added this information in the revised manuscript.
ment: Figure 2 - I very much like this figure because it shows clearly the different areas with color codes. But
rror bars are very wide in most cases, so this figure makes me wonder if the Engravings are maybe not so
ar to Objects..... the statistics are more convincing.
onse: We agree with this reviewer that the similarity is better supported by the statistics. The purpose of the
e is just that of summarizing the information in easy-to-read format. There are two arguments in favour of a
arity between engravings and objects: the absence of interaction conditions x hROIS for these two conditions
reas the interaction exists between engravings and the other conditions) and the existence of a significant
lation between the activation profile of engravings and objects.

ment: Mellet and colleagues conducted a study to test whether Paleolithic engravings elicits similar
esentations in the visual pathway to objects and this similarity was indeed found. There is only one engraving
n in the paper (there should be more shown) and based on this one example these engravings look like
plex shapes. Therefore, I don’t see any reason why they would not elicit responses in visual regions, even the
higher in the hierarchy, as complex shapes have been shown to elicit responses in these regions. Therefore, I
this question not very novel. I could understand an added value of testing the actual engravings but I can’t
3
evaluate them as they are not shown in the manuscript or in supplementary material. In general, there is not
gh information in the manuscript to fully evaluate it and the unreadability of some of the figures makes it hard
aluate the findings.
onse: To be precise, the goal of our research was not that of contrasting the perception of Paleolithic
avings and objects. It involved contrasting the earliest engravings with four visual categories, including objects,
heir scrambled version, in order to evaluate what areas were more elicited by the earliest engravings, which
ent different degrees of complexity. Although we concur with this reviewer that involvement of areas higher in
ierarchy was a reasonable expectation, at least for the more complex engravings, the only available and highly
spread theory before our research to explain the emergence of this behaviour in the evolution of our genus
gson, 2006, 2014) was predicting that the emergence and perception of these engravings exclusively involved
rimary visual cortex. In the revised version of the manuscript, we explain previous hypotheses in more detail
present the images of all objects and the tracings of all the engravings included in the experiments. The
ution of the figures has also been improved. As a result of these changes, the novelty of the study is now more
rent and the dataset more explicit. Testing the photos of the actual objects would have introduced a bias in
esearch since engravings occur on media of different colour, texture and state of preservation.
several issues with this manuscript that I would invite the authors to address.
ment: As previously mentioned the stimuli of the engravings are not shown and that seems to be crucial for
rstanding the value of this paper. Other stimuli classes are also not shown and the authors do not state what
gories the objects were sampled from and what words were used. All this information is important for this
r.
onse: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. All the stimuli used are now provided as supplementary
rial.
ment: Why stimulus time presentation is not the same for objects, scenes, and words, and for engravings
ms vs 200 ms)? If they are being directly compared as few parameters as possible should differ between the
itions.
onse: The conditions including the engravings and strings of linear B characters were the subject of a
vioural pre-manipulation that allowed us to optimize the presentation times for these stimuli. The stimuli for
ther conditions were provided by another team and came from previous published studies (Kauffmann et al,
, Roux-Sibilon et al, 2018) for which presentation times were 100 ms longer. Since the two presentation times
ted from a well-argued choice, we preferred not to modify them. We are aware that it is preferable to limit the
rences but it is important to note that the visual categories were not compared directly but that we compared
ifference between intact stimuli and their scrambled versions (whose presentation times were identical). We
compare the visual categories on the basis of this difference. The potential biases related to the difference in
entation time are therefore eliminated.
ment: It is not enough to say O3-1 and O3-2 correspond LO. To make this claim the authors should show an
lap of these regions using a LO mask from for example Wang atlas.
onse: We plotted the maximum activation of several studies which located LO, and superimposed them on the
and O3-2 regions. As one can see here below these peaks project quite well on these two regions (yellow: O3-
ue: 03-2). given that the SD for the peaks coordinates vary from 7 to 10 mm.
4
dition, it is in these two regions that the activation is maximum in the contrast “object minus scrambled
ct” from the present study. This contrast is typically used to locate the LOC. We added the following sentence
e revised version of the manuscript: “LO is defined as the brain area showing the greatest activation while
ing a known or novel object compared to its scrambled version (Malach et al., 1995; Grill-Spector et al.,
1). As shown in table S3 (supplementary material) these two regions exhibited the largest activation in the
cts minus scrambled objects” contrast in the present study.”
ment: Different ROIs should be discussed more. It is not enough to say that 10 ROIs elicit a given response
rn. It is important to discuss more what these regions are implicated in and why the result makes sense. The
ors try this procedure for LO, however, even there they discuss only a part of the picture. The authors say that
s sensitive to the shape, but not the semantics”. There is a body of literature that claims otherwise and this
ld be also discussed.
onse:
es the ventral regions for which a specificity has been shown (such as LOC, VWFA, FFA etc…), many regions
not yet been specifically involved in the processing of a particular visual category. It is possible that these
ns have a more general purpose (Grill-Spector, 2003). It has also been proposed that the representation of a
ept is reflected by a distinct pattern of response across all ventral cortex, and this distributed activation
uces the visual perception (Haxby et al., 2001). In this context, it is difficult to discuss the involvement of each
n and we preferred to discuss the overall activation pattern along the ventral pathway. Nevertheless, when
e regions corresponded to well documented functional areas (LOC, VWFA...) we discussed them in accordance
the existing literature.
eviewer raised an important issue regarding the role of LO in semantic. To our knowledge, there is no study
has reported such sensitivity in the lateral occipital (LO) part of the LOC. On the contrary, several studies have
n that activity in this region (mainly based on adaptation paradigm) is not affected by the change in visual
gories (Grill-Spector et al., 1999; Vuilleumier et al., 2002; Chouinard et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2009; Margalit et
017). The situation is more nuanced with regard to the ventral part of the LOC (called Pfs). At least two studies
rted an effect of visual categories in the left fusiform gyrus (Koutstaal et al., 2001; Simons et al., 2003).
ever, none of the studies cited above reported this activation and they concluded that the entire LOC is not
tive to semantic information. We added the following sentence in the revised manuscript: “Concerning the
ral part of the LOC, it has been shown that the left fusiform gyrus, which is involved in the visual processing of
avings, is sensitive to semantic information (Koutstaal et al., 2001; Simons et al., 2003). However, the studies
tioned above did not report such a property”.
ment: The authors partly acknowledge that they can’t claim that these engravings elicited similar patterns of
onses as objects in early humans. However, this should be stressed more. The fact that the visual cortex did not
5
nd that much during the evolution does not mean that the visual representations in the cortex in early humans
people nowadays were the same. A [potentially stronger argument could be that the visual representations in
ans and macaque monkeys are similar and therefore it is likely that the visual representations of early humans
similar, however, we can’t explicitly test that.
onse: The reviewer is right in pointing out the main difficulty of our approach. Inferring the cognitive abilities
ssil human populations from the functional study of the modern human brain is, of course, not a simple
rtaking. As suggested by the reviewer regarding the visual cortex, anatomical-functional differences probably
ot represent a main bias. Evolution does not seem to have profoundly modified its structure (Ponce de León et
016; Holloway et al., 2018). The study of functional homologies between monkeys and humans points to a
ervation of major functional subdivisions, at least with regard to low-level visual areas and the ventral pathway
an et al., 2004). As pointed out by the reviewer, this does not guarantee with certainty that the
esentations in the visual cortex of our ancestors were identical to ours. The relatively small impact of evolution
is cortex suggests that inferences about the past can reasonably be made from results obtained when working
the modern brain. Another aspect that need to be considered is that if these engravings were familiar to the
hominims, who purposely produced them, they were not to our participants. This may have an effect on the
al networks mobilized. We are currently conducting the same study with archaeologists who are experts in this
of material in order to compensate for this familiarity bias.
ollowing paragraph has been added at page 8 (in red in the revised version): “There is of course no guarantee
the brain areas activated by the engravings were, in our ancestors, identical to ours. Regarding the visual
x, anatomical-functional differences do not probably represent a main bias. Evolution does not seem to have
oundly modified its structure (Ponce de León et al., 2016; Holloway et al., 2018). Moreover, investigations on
ional homologies between monkeys and humans points to a preservation of major functional subdivisions, at
with regard to low-level visual areas and the ventral pathway (Orban et al., 2004). Since these regions appear
ve been moderately impacted by the evolution of the brain It is reasonable to think that the present results
apply to other representatives of the Homo lineage”.
ment: Resolution of figures is not acceptable in the paper. I can’t even read the values on the y-axis of Figure 2
herefore comment on the results.
onse: We have improved the resolution of the figures and increased the size of the characters for a better
ability.
ment: Labels should be added in panels B and D in Figure 3 as otherwise the dots are not readable.
onse: As requested by the reviewer, we added the labels in all the panels of the Figure 3.
r comments:
ment: Table 1 could be presented in a color-coded way to enable rapid detection of significant values, e.g.,
ficant values colored in green.
onse: Table 1 now includes a color code to display significant activation, deactivation and left-right
metries.
ment: The header should be “funding” not “fundings”, as the latter word does not exist in the English
uage.
onse: It has been corrected
