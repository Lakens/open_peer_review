the manuscript can NOT be recommended for publication.

evidence that verify the successful encapsulation of dye into ZIF-8 should be provided and
explicitly highlighted. EDX analyses are definitely not enough to draw the conclusion of
successful encapsulation of dye. Same results could easily be obtained from the physical mixture
of dyes and ZIF-8.

Comments to the Author(s)
It is an interesting work. However, the qualities of MS should be improved before
being published.
Response: Many thanks for your support. The manuscript has been improved.
- In paper, there is little explanations of reason. For example, from TEM images,
the particle size of dye@ZIF-8 decreased after adding dye, why?; suggesting adding
size distribution.
Response: The decrease of particle size is mainly due to the increase of the dye size.
- In XRD patterns, the peak intensity of L1FC2@ZIF-8 is lower compared to others
at 20-50o, why? S
Response: This could be due to the X-ray absorption of iron that present in L1FC2.
- Authors state that, “the color of the synthesized materials confirms the presence of
the dye in the final products”, whether is there any other evidences to determine dye
in the final products?
1
Response: Yes, the dye concentration was determined using elemental analysis.
HAADF, EELS and EDX analysis was also used to confirm the presence of the dye.
- Emission lifetimes and DSSCs efficiencies in MS should be compared with the
reported references.
Response: Thanks for suggestion. It was added.
Fig.3f is unclear and its quality must be improved.
Response: Improved accordingly.

This manuscript reported a methodology of dye encapsulation for dye sensitized
solar cells, where ZIF-8 was employed as dye host. This method enhanced the longer
emission lifetimes of dye but at a cost of efficiency. Considering the novelty, quality
and solidity of this manuscript, the manuscript can NOT be recommended for
publication. Suggestions and questions for improvement of this manuscript are
listed as below:
1. Introduction should be focused on gap point of this manuscript, instead of
narrating the cumbersome information, which would confuse the readers.
Response: Thanks for suggestion. Introduction has been revised accordingly.
2. Afterall, the core novelty of this manuscript lies in the encapsulation of dye
into ZIF-8. Solid evidence that verify the successful encapsulation of dye into ZIF-8
should be provided and explicitly highlighted. EDX analyses are definitely not
enough to draw the conclusion of successful encapsulation of dye. Same results
could easily be obtained from the physical mixture of dyes and ZIF-8.
Response: we have several evidences. The dye's size is larger than the samll pore
size of conventional microporous ZIF-8 (Largest Cavity
Diameter , and Pore Limiting
Diameter are 11.4 Å, and 3.4 Å, respectively). First evidence, there is no observation
of the dye in the surface of ZIF-8 in TEM images. Second, nitrogen adsorption
reveals the formation of mesopore due to the dye. Third, we added a new data set of
FT-IR showing the difference between encapsulated and adsorbed dye.
'' The spectra show that the vibration and rotation modes (<1600 cm-1) of the free dye are
significantly suppressed due to the encapsulation. The difference between encapsulated
and adsorbed dye can be illustrated using FT-IR spectra (Figure S2). Conventional
microporous ZIF-8 has small pore size compared to the dye, thus the dye cannot be
located into the pore via adsorption. The band of O—H (3000 cm-1) of carboxylic groups
in the L1 dye is broad in case of adsorbed dye compared to the encapsulated dye (Figure
S2). The adsorbed dye display a band at 1840 cm-1 corresponding to cyano group C=N,
which is absent in the encapsulated dye. There is also shift in the wavenumber of
carbonyl group at 1580 cm-1, and 1595 cm-1 for encapsulated and adsorbed dye,
respectively (Figure S2). These observations are due to association of the dye with the
surface of ZIF-8. Based on sulphur atom percentage, as determined from elemental
analysis, the encapsulated dye concentrations were determined to be 1.3%, 1.8%, and
2.5% for L1@ZIF-8, L1Fc@ZIF-8, and L1Fc2@ZIF-8, respectively.''

L1Fc>L1 in size, Figure 1a)." For these results, can you tell much more reasons of

Response: Many thanks for suggestion. References and explanation have been
added as highlighted in red color.
''TEM images of the prepared materials show that the crystal size of ZIF-8 ranges from
20 to 100 nm (Figure 2), and decreases with the increase of dye size (L1Fc2> L1Fc>L1 in
size due to ferrocene moieties, Figure 1a). As previously reported, the addition of TEA to
a solution of Zn(NO3)2 results in the formation of ZnO nanocrystals39. Addition of the
dye to the formed ZnO leads to adsorption prior to conversion to ZIF-8 crystals after
addition of Hmim. The large dyes such as L1Fc2 may improve the dispersion of the
formed ZnO nanocrystals and increase the nucleation rate over than the growth rate of
ZIF-8 crystal resulting to small particles of ZIF-8. In addition, inter-particle mesopore
structures are formed in L1Fc2@ZIF-8 (Figure 2). SEM images show that the particle
size of dye@ZIF-8 for L1, L1Fc, and L1Fc2 ranges from 20 to 100 nm (Figure S3), which
agrees with TEM images (Figure 2). The color of the synthesized materials confirms the
presence of the dye in the final products, as shown in Figure S4.''
