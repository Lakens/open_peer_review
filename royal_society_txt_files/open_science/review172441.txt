Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
I am pleased to have reviewed this manuscript as it focuses on one of the most enigmatic groups
of herbivorous marine mammals, the Desmostylia. This manuscript is generally well constructed;
it describes in detail the femoral morphology of the desmostylian genus Paleoparadoxia, based
on a specimen with historical importance. The manuscript goes at great lengths to account the
discovery and rediscovery of the specimen and location of its original provenance. This leads to
discussions about the importance of properly maintained collections and specially the data
associated to specimens. The figures are clear and informative, although I suggest that an
additional figure, comparing distinct desmostylian femora should be added for ease of
comparison.
However, I have some recommendations that I have outlined in detail below and that I hope the
authors take into consideration. Mainly they are stylistic or grammatical, but there are some
corrections that need to be done to the content as well.
Main comments:
1) The emended diagnosis for Desmostylia and Paleoparadoxia should not be limited to the
femoral morphology, but also include other elements, cranial and postcranial as applicable. This
should be done with the purpose of completion and to provide the most complete, most up-to-
date diagnosis for those groups.
2) The article seems to be missing crucial comparative data. I strongly suggest that Table 3 be
expanded to include the measurements of all the desmostylian specimens that were compared.
3) I suggest that tables 1-2 be moved to supplemental files.
4) I suggest the authors revise the references and acknowledgements; there are several
grammatical errors in the author names.
Specific comments:
Page 3 (abstract), lines 34-35: I suggest the authors change: “This fossil was found from Tsuchiyu
Onsen town, Fukushima.” to “This fossil was in the town of Tsuchiyu Onsen, Fukushima.”
Page 3 (abstract), lines 35-36: I do not fully understand how this sentence connects to the others:
“Owing to the original note, which was made over 60 years ago, with a set of associated
information (local address, discoverer’s name, date).”
Did the authors meant to say something like this: “Owing to the original note, which was made
over 60 years ago, with a set of associated information (local address, discoverer’s name, date),
we know the fossil was found in the town of Tsuchiyu Onsen, Fukushima.”
Page 3 (abstract), line 39: I suggest the authors change: “As historical recognitions, we learned
that the fossil was known to be a “dinosaur”…” to “We learned that, historically, the fossil was
known to be a “dinosaur”…”
3
Page 4, line 53: I suggest the authors change: “Within collection rooms of museums are housed
many ‘treasures’.” To “Many ‘treasures’ are housed within collection rooms of museums.”
Page 4, line 55: I suggest the authors change: “… attract attentions of…” to “… attract attention
of…”
Page 4, lines 64-65: I suggest the authors change: “… Corps Base Camp, had been gone.” to “…
Corps Base Camp, was not properly recorded.”
Page 4, lines 65-68: I suggest the authors change: “All of these discoveries are from museum
cabinets. To make unexpected discoveries from museum cabinets, the label information is
fundamentally critical because the fossil material cannot be fully utilized in research purposes if
locality information associated with the uncatalogued specimen is lost.” To “These are some
examples of the value of museum collections and how they can lead to unexpected discoveries.
However, the label information is fundamentally critical when making these discoveries because
the fossil material cannot be fully utilized in research purposes if locality information associated
with the specimen is lost.”
Page 4, line 69: I suggest the authors change: “… which is one of iconic…” to “which is one
iconic…”
Page 5, line 82: I suggest the authors change: “… with the short fieldwork.” to “… with
fieldwork.”
Page 5, line 90: I suggest the authors change: “… Desmostylus japonisus;” to “… Desmostylus
japonicus;”
Page 5, lines 90-91: I suggest the authors change: “Nevertheless, the UTPV 0001 specimen
shows…” to “Nevertheless, UTPV 0001 shows the…”
Page 6, line 106: I suggest the authors change: “The measurements were followed after Inuzuka
[12, 13].” to “The measurements of the femora were made following Inuzuka [12, 13].”
Page 11, line 209: lower and middle are not internationally recognized subdivisions of the
Miocene, therefore they should not be capitalized, I suggest the authors change that part to: “The
lower to middle Miocene Tsuchiyutoge…”
Page 12, line 222: I suggest the authors change: “…colored rock pieces or minerals.” to “…colored
rock fragments or minerals.”
Page 12, lines 222-223: I suggest the authors change: “A small portion of the host rock was still in
tack in the UTPV 0001 specimen. It is medium sandstone, containing 2-3 mm gravel.” to “A small
portion of the host rock was still attached to UTPV 0001, it is medium sandstone, containing 2-3
mm gravel.”
Page 12, line 227 and page 13, lines 242-243: I suggest the authors change: “…because lithofaces of
potential locality #2 is impossible to be observed.” to “…because lithofacies at potential locality
#2 are impossible to observe.”
Pages 13-14, lines 263-266: The age of the youngest zircon is not necessarily the age of the
formation, the zircon formed in a nearby volcanic deposit and was then eroded and deposited in
the Tsuchiyutoge Fm., which means some time elapsed between the formation of the zircon and
4
its redeposition. Above it is stated that nannofossils constrain the age of the Tsuchiyutoge Fm., to
the CN4 zone (13.5-14.9 Ma). I would consider the nannofossil age to be more precise and that the
zircon age confirms that range as with the error, the zircon could be as young as 14.3 Ma.
Page 15, line 270: I would consider, and suggest, that the emended diagnosis not be exclusively
based on the femur, as there are many other characteristics that diagnose Desmostylia. I suggest
the authors include an emended diagnosis that includes cranial and postcranial elements.
Page 15, line 278: Emended diagnosis for Paleoparadoxia. As stated above for Desmostylia, the
emended diagnosis should be expanded to include cranial and any other postcranial feature that
diagnoses this genus as a whole.
Page 15, line 278: “Larger femoral head” large vs small are relative terms, please specify. Can the
authors compare ratios to quantify what do they mean by large femoral head? For example, what
is the ratio between transverse diameter of femoral head and transverse diameter the shaft below
the lesser trochanter for UTPV 0001? How would it compare to Neoparadoxia?
Page 15, line 287: see comment above about the age of the Formation.
Page 16, line 293: Change “Table 2” to “Table 3”
Page 16, line 295-296: “The femoral head of UTPV 0001 is larger than in Ashoroa (AMP 21) and
Neoparadoxia (UCMP 81302 and LACM 150150),…” According to the measurements provided
the head of UTPV 0001 is smaller, than that of Neoparadoxia cecilialina (LACM 150150; Barnes,
2013:table 5). Please change accordingly.
Page 17, line 337: I suggest the authors change: “UTPV 0001 was identified to be Paleoparadoxia
based…” to “UTPV 0001 was identified as Paleoparadoxia based…”
Page 18, line 341: I suggest the authors change: “…Paleoparadoxia sense…” to “…Paleoparadoxia
sensu…”
Page 18, line 349: Change “femurs” to “femora”
Page 18, line 353: Change “…femurs are known…” to “femora are known…”
Page 23, lines 470-471: I suggest the authors change: “For that reasons, the importance of
information about specimen occurrence is increasing.” to “This is one of the many reasons, for an
increase of the importance of specimen occurrence information.”
Page 23, lines 471-475: These sentences could be summarized as this: “Some recent examples of
the use of this data in marine mammal studies, include analyses of marine mammals vs other
animals or diatoms [37, 44], analyses on the evolution of gigantism in whales and sirenians [45,
46], and depths of desmostylian habitats [47].”
Page 24, lines 480-483: These sentences could be summarized as: “In addition, primary
identification of the specimens and dissemination of that information is important, as otherwise
there is a risk for specimens to be forgotten as in the example of UTPV 0001.”
Page 25, line 494: see earlier comments on the age of the formation.
Table 3. It seems this table only has the measurements pertaining to UTPV 0001, for the
comparison to be complete I suggest the authors include the measurement of the other specimens
5
they compared to. In addition, the first measurement is “Maximum length” I suggest that since
UTPV 0001 is incomplete that the authors either change to “Maximum length as preserved” or to
add a + symbol next to the measurement as an indicator that the measurement is incomplete.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors present an interesting manuscript which describes the re-discovery of a fragmentary
femur of a spectacular fossil taxon, a desmostyle. I am not confident with this group, but the
taxonomic analyze is based on a complete set of data, and seems correct to me. Anyway the most
interesting part of the paper lies in the investigation, including Zircon analyze, historic
researches as well as interview of witnesses of the fossil discovery.
I agree that this work deserves to be published, but I would recommend some minor to moderate
changes:
The form:
-I am not an English native speaker, but the text may need some language review.
-In the reference, some species names not in italic (e.g. 1, 5...).
-The competitive interest is provided twice.
-The abstract may need to be re-written, because it does not, in my eyes, reflect the interest of the
paper. In addition it does not mention the Zircon dating.
The content:
I would have seen the interest of the paper in the integrative methods, that allow to reconstruct
the lacking information, instead of concluding that specimens have to be correctly labeled, a
banality indeed. This is much more positive.
I do not see much interest in the last § of the 5.2. It is evident that it is better if the specimen is
correctly identified. But it absolutely does not induce that it will be “forgotten”. I give much
more importance to the correct information regarding the geographic and stratigraphic context.

Similarly the conclusion of your abstract (“the best practice for paleontologists is to do research
on the fossils as soon as possible”) is a common sense. L 452: “To avoid such an incident, a
collection registry, most likely into a digital database, must be done in a proper manner.” It is a
common sense, and it depends on how the authors define proper manner. It is most often the case
that, because of the lack of time/specialists, the fossils cannot be immediately identified. It is not
“proper” then?
In two sentences (L 393 and 423) the authors comment on the health condition of Mr. Azuma. I
think it is not elegant. To be deleted.
L 456: The authors refer to publications in which the taxonomic identifications are suspect. This
has to be explained.
Finally, the figure 6 is in such not useful. The authors should at least translate the titles in the
figure caption, or give explanations.

I am glad to see this revised version and that most of my earlier comments and corrections have
been addressed appropriately.
13
I do have a few comments on this new version which I hope the authors take into consideration.
They are detailed below.
Lines 31-32: I suggest removing the first sentence and starting the abstract with the next one:
"Here, we report on a new..."
Line 33: I suggest the authors change "... fossil from geological collections of a national..." to "...
fossil in the geological collection at a national..."
Lines 34-35: I suggest the authors remove the phrase "... for an unknown reason." It does not add
anything to the narrative.
Line 41: I suggest the authors change "... was identified to be a right femur..." to "... was re-
identified as a right femur..."
Lines 51-52: I suggest the authors change "... in collection rooms of museums. Many specimens
are waiting to be catalogued and described." to "... in museum collections with many specimens
waiting to be catalogued and described."
Line 53: I suggest the authors change "... researchers provide new..." to "... researchers who
provide new..."
Lines 54-56: I suggest the authors remove this example or rewrite it with more details. As it is
currently written the narrative is confusing.
Line 70: The text seems overlapped in the pdf.
Lines 82-84: I suggest the authors rephrase this sentence to something similar to: "Desmostylia is
an extinct group of marine mammals known from the North Pacific Region; a lot of skeletons are
known from early to middle Miocene deposits in Japan." The authors should keep in mind that
"early" and "middle" are not internationally recognized divisions of the Miocene, and therefore
should not be capitalized.
Lines 90-92: I suggest the authors change "... which femur fossils are known (Behemotops,
Paleoparadoxia, Neoparadoxia, Ashoroa, Cornwallius, Desmostylus). Observed specimens are
listed below." to "... which the femur is known (Behemotops, Paleoparadoxia, Neoparadoxia,
Ashoroa, Cornwallius, Desmostylus); observed specimens are listed below."
Line 134: typo: Sooke Formation
Line 274: What about the diagnosis provided by Barnes (2013)?
Lines 289-292: I strongly suggest the authors include a ratio or a percentage that facilitates the
reader to understand the size difference of the femoral head. Using the data from Table 1 I
compared the transverse diameter (TD) of the femoral head with the maximum proximal width
(MPW), and noticed that for EESUT-PV-0001 the TD is about 48% of the MPW, which was similar
to that of Behemotops (49%), Paleoparadoxia (48%), Neoparadoxia (47%), slightly smaller than
that of Ashoroa (44%) and smaller than the specimens of Desmostylus, which were between 50-
61%. Based on that I suggest the authors change the comparison accordingly or be more explicit
as to which measurements they are comparing.
Lines 303-304: I suggest the authors include a ratio of percentage that supports this statement.
14
Based on the overlapping measurements UCMP 81302 was a larger individual than EESUT-PV-
0001 so it is otherwise expected for the trochanter to be thinner in the smaller of the two.
Line 313: I suggest the authors change "... (AMP 21), it..." to "... (AMP 21), where it..."
Line 315: Are there measurements of the angle of the intertrochanteric crest than can be added to
table 1?
Line 323: I suggest the authors change "... (USNM 26134) that have..." to "... (USNM 26134) which
have..."
Line 325: I suggest the authors change "... fracture surface of EESUT-PV-0001 has thick..." to "...
fractured surface of EESUT-PV-0001 shows a thick..."
Line 455: Typo? "include ecological???"
Table 1: At least some of the comparative measurements for Neoparadoxia cecilialina can be
obtained from Barnes (2013;Table 5). Including the maximum length (= greatest length) and
transverse diameter of femoral head.

We have followed all these comments and revised the manuscript accordingly for re-
submission. I have addressed all the comments by the referee. The details of my response
are listed below. In addition, the specimen number was changed to UTPV 0001 to
EESUT–PV–0001 and we changed the configuration slightly. All our original results of
Zircon analysis are listed in Table S2 and the data plots are reproduced by using data
listed in Table S2 and methods.
Reviewer #1
I thank Reviewer 1 for carefully reading my manuscript and giving helpful comments.
After revised this manuscript as follow your comments, it was checked by third-party
oversight and I had native speakers of English proofread my English writing. Therefore,
expressions have changed a bit.
Main comments #1
1) The emended diagnosis for Desmostylia and Paleoparadoxia should not be limited to
the femoral morphology, but also include other elements, cranial and postcranial as
applicable. This should be done with the purpose of completion and to provide the most
complete, most up-to-date diagnosis for those groups.
Response
Line 263 and 272: We inserted notes on diagnosis of other parts.
Main comments #2
2) The article seems to be missing crucial comparative data. I strongly suggest that Table
3 be expanded to include the measurements of all the desmostylian specimens that were
compared.
Response
Table 1: We added measurements of other desmostylian femora.
Main comments #3
3) I suggest that tables 1-2 be moved to supplemental files.
Response
Table S1 and S2: We moved Tables 1 and 2 to supplemental files.
Main comments #4
4) I suggest the authors revise the references and acknowledgements; there are several
grammatical errors in the author names.
Response
References and Acknowledgement section : We corrected the references and
acknowledgements.
Specific comments #1

Tsuchiyu Onsen town, Fukushima.” to “This fossil was in the town of Tsuchiyu Onsen,
Fukushima.”
Response
Line 34–35: We have changed this sentence as follow.
Specific comments #2
Page 3 (abstract), lines 35-36: I do not fully understand how this sentence connects to the
others: “Owing to the original note, which was made over 60 years ago, with a set of
associated information (local address, discoverer’s name, date).”
Did the authors meant to say something like this: “Owing to the original note, which was
made over 60 years ago, with a set of associated information (local address, discoverer’s
name, date), we know the fossil was found in the town of Tsuchiyu Onsen, Fukushima.”
Response
Line 35–37: We have changed this sentence as follow.

museum cabinets. To make unexpected discoveries from museum cabinets, the label
information is fundamentally critical because the fossil material cannot be fully utilized
in research purposes if locality information associated with the uncatalogued specimen is
lost.” To “These are some examples of the value of museum collections and how they
can lead to unexpected discoveries. However, the label information is fundamentally
critical when making these discoveries because the fossil material cannot be fully utilized
in research purposes if locality information associated with the specimen is lost.”
Response
Line 63–66: We have changed this sentence as follow.

been largely changed with English proofing.
Specific comments #17
Pages 13-14, lines 263-266: The age of the youngest zircon is not necessarily the age of
the formation, the zircon formed in a nearby volcanic deposit and was then eroded and
deposited in the Tsuchiyutoge Fm., which means some time elapsed between the
formation of the zircon and its redeposition. Above it is stated that nannofossils constrain
the age of the Tsuchiyutoge Fm., to the CN4 zone (13.5-14.9 Ma). I would consider the
nannofossil age to be more precise and that the zircon age confirms that range as with the
error, the zircon could be as young as 14.3 Ma.
Response
Content: We would like to keep the interpretation in the original manuscript.
Sato et al. (2016: J. Volc. Geotherm. Res., 310, 89–97) pointed out from the
study of Late Cretaceous pyroclastic rock sequences in Southwest Japan that the zircon
U–Pb age of volcanic rocks is representative of the eruption age of such rocks, as the
latter is generally within the 2s uncertainty (i.e., several hundred thousand years) of the
former.
If the youngest zircon we discussed (15.1 ± 0.8 Ma) is a product of the
volcanism contemporaneous with the deposition of the sandstone, the depositional age of
the sandstone is 15.1 ± 0.8 Ma within the 2s uncertainty (0.8 Myr). On the other hand, if
the youngest zircon is a product of the older igneous activity, the depositional age of the
sandstone is younger than 15.9 Ma, considering the 2s uncertainty (0.8 Myr).
Judging from the oscillatory zoning, the youngest zircon from the sandstone is
igneous zircon. However, we cannot conclude that it is a product of contemporaneous
volcanism or not. Hence what we can mention from the zircon geochronology in this
study is that the sandstone was deposited at 15.9 Ma or later.
Specific comments #18
Page 15, line 270: I would consider, and suggest, that the emended diagnosis not be
exclusively based on the femur, as there are many other characteristics that diagnose
Desmostylia. I suggest the authors include an emended diagnosis that includes cranial
and postcranial elements.
Response
Line 263: We inserted notes on diagnosis of other parts.
Specific comments #19
Page 15, line 278: Emended diagnosis for Paleoparadoxia. As stated above for
Desmostylia, the emended diagnosis should be expanded to include cranial and any other
postcranial feature that diagnoses this genus as a whole.
Response
Line 272: We inserted notes on diagnosis of other parts.
Specific comments #20
Page 15, line 278: “Larger femoral head” large vs small are relative terms, please specify.
Can the authors compare ratios to quantify what do they mean by large femoral head? For
example, what is the ratio between transverse diameter of femoral head and transverse
diameter the shaft below the lesser trochanter for UTPV 0001? How would it compare to
Neoparadoxia?
Response
Line 268: This is a relative phrase, so we added a description about it.
Specific comments #21

21) and Neoparadoxia (UCMP 81302 and LACM 150150),…” According to the
measurements provided the head of UTPV 0001 is smaller, than that of Neoparadoxia
cecilialina (LACM 150150; Barnes, 2013:table 5). Please change accordingly.
Response
Line 287: This is a relative phrase, so we added a description about it.

Page 23, lines 471-475: These sentences could be summarized as this: “Some recent
examples of the use of this data in marine mammal studies, include analyses of marine
mammals vs other animals or diatoms [37, 44], analyses on the evolution of gigantism in
whales and sirenians [45, 46], and depths of desmostylian habitats [47].”

Page 24, lines 480-483: These sentences could be summarized as: “In addition, primary
identification of the specimens and dissemination of that information is important, as
otherwise there is a risk for specimens to be forgotten as in the example of UTPV 0001.”
Response
This sentence has deleted.

Table 3. It seems this table only has the measurements pertaining to UTPV 0001, for the
comparison to be complete I suggest the authors include the measurement of the other
specimens they compared to. In addition, the first measurement is “Maximum length” I
suggest that since UTPV 0001 is incomplete that the authors either change to “Maximum
length as preserved” or to add a + symbol next to the measurement as an indicator that
the measurement is incomplete.
Response
Table 1: We have changed this table as follow. Neoparadoxia cecilialina (LACM 150150)
is currently mounted, so observation is possible but accurate measurement has not been
done. Cf. Cornwallius sookensis (USNM 11076) was cut for cross-section observation,
so measurement was not carried out.
Reviewer #2
I thank Reviewer 2 for carefully reading my manuscript and giving helpful comments.
The form:
Comment #1
-I am not an English native speaker, but the text may need some language review.
Response
This manuscript was checked by third-party oversight and I had native speakers of
English proofread my English writing.
Comment #2
-In the reference, some species names not in italic (e.g. 1, 5...).
Response
Reference section: We modified species name to italic.
Comment #3
-The competitive interest is provided twice.
Response
Competitive section: We reduce one of this section.
Comment #4
-The abstract may need to be re-written, because it does not, in my eyes, reflect the interest
of the paper. In addition it does not mention the Zircon dating.
Response
Abstract section: We changed Abstract to reflect the importance of the paper. We also
added about zircon data to Abstract.
The content:
Comment #5
I would have seen the interest of the paper in the integrative methods, that allow to
reconstruct the lacking information, instead of concluding that specimens have to be
correctly labeled, a banality indeed. This is much more positive.
I do not see much interest in the last § of the 5.2. It is evident that it is better if the
specimen is correctly identified. But it absolutely does not induce that it will be
“forgotten”. I give much more importance to the correct information regarding the
geographic and stratigraphic context. Similarly, the conclusion of your abstract (“the best
practice for paleontologists is to do research on the fossils as soon as possible”) is a
common sense.
L 452: “To avoid such an incident, a collection registry, most likely into a digital database,
must be done in a proper manner.” It is a common sense, and it depends on how the
authors define proper manner. It is most often the case that, because of the lack of
time/specialists, the fossils cannot be immediately identified. It is not “proper” then?
Response
We removed the last sentence of the chapter 5.2 and L 452.
Comment #6
In two sentences (L 393 and 423) the authors comment on the health condition of Mr.
Azuma. I think it is not elegant. To be deleted.
Response
We reduced these phrases.
Comment #7
L 456: The authors refer to publications in which the taxonomic identifications are
suspect. This has to be explained.
Response
Line 350–351: We added explanation these publication’s problem.
Comment #8
Finally, the figure 6 is in such not useful. The authors should at least translate the titles in
the figure caption, or give explanations.
Response
Figure 6: We changed the title and added explanation.

Response to Referee
Re: Re: “A long-forgotten “dinosaur” bone from a museum cabinet, uncovered to be a
Japan's iconic extinct mammal, Paleoparadoxia (Desmostylia, Mammalia)" Manuscript
ID RSOS-172441
We have followed all these comments and revised the manuscript accordingly for re-
submission. I have addressed all the comments by the referee. The details of my response
are listed below.
Reviewer #1
We thank Reviewer #1 for carefully reading my manuscript and giving helpful comments.
Comment #1
Lines 31-32: I suggest removing the first sentence and starting the abstract with the next
one: "Here, we report on a new..."
Response
in Abstract section: We have deleted this sentence as follow.
Comment #2
Line 33: I suggest the authors change "... fossil from geological collections of a
national..." to "... fossil in the geological collection at a national..."
Response
Line 31–32: We have changed this sentence as follow.
Comment #3
Lines 34-35: I suggest the authors remove the phrase "... for an unknown reason." It does
not add anything to the narrative.
Response
in Abstract section: We have deleted this sentence as follow.
Comment #4
Line 41: I suggest the authors change "... was identified to be a right femur..." to "... was
re-identified as a right femur..."
Response
Line 39: The word "identify" is a better choice than "re-identify" in this case because
the specimen was not identified before we did. Everything else was modified as
suggested.
Comment #5
Lines 51-52: I suggest the authors change "... in collection rooms of museums. Many
specimens are waiting to be catalogued and described." to "... in museum collections with
many specimens waiting to be catalogued and described."
Response
Line 49–50: We have changed this sentence as follow.
Comment #6
Line 53: I suggest the authors change "... researchers provide new..." to "... researchers
who provide new..."
Response
Line 51: We have changed this sentence as follow.
Comment #7
Lines 54-56: I suggest the authors remove this example or rewrite it with more details.
As it is currently written the narrative is confusing.
Response
in Introduction section: We have deleted this sentence as follow.
Comment #8
Line 70: The text seems overlapped in the pdf.
Response
Line 66: Original docx text are not overlapped. Therefore, we could not know why texts
were overlapped and did not change this section.
Comment #9
Lines 82-84: I suggest the authors rephrase this sentence to something similar to:
"Desmostylia is an extinct group of marine mammals known from the North Pacific
Region; a lot of skeletons are known from early to middle Miocene deposits in Japan."
The authors should keep in mind that "early" and "middle" are not internationally
recognized divisions of the Miocene, and therefore should not be capitalized.
Response
Line 80: We have changed this sentence as follow.
Comment #10
Lines 90-92: I suggest the authors change "... which femur fossils are known (Behemotops,
Paleoparadoxia, Neoparadoxia, Ashoroa, Cornwallius, Desmostylus). Observed
specimens are listed below." to "... which the femur is known (Behemotops,
Paleoparadoxia, Neoparadoxia, Ashoroa, Cornwallius, Desmostylus); observed
specimens are listed below."
Response
Line 86–88: We have changed this sentence as follow.
Comment #11
Line 134: typo: Sooke Formation
Response
Line 132: We have changed this sentence as follow.
Comment #12
Line 274: What about the diagnosis provided by Barnes (2013)?
Response
Barnes (2013) did not provide new diagnosis for Paleoparadoxia. Therefore, we did not
refer Barnes (2013) here.
Comment #14
Lines 289-292: I strongly suggest the authors include a ratio or a percentage that
facilitates the reader to understand the size difference of the femoral head. Using the data
from Table 1 I compared the transverse diameter (TD) of the femoral head with the
maximum proximal width (MPW), and noticed that for EESUT-PV-0001 the TD is about
48% of the MPW, which was similar to that of Behemotops (49%), Paleoparadoxia (48%),
Neoparadoxia (47%), slightly smaller than that of Ashoroa (44%) and smaller than the
specimens of Desmostylus, which were between 50-61%. Based on that I suggest the
authors change the comparison accordingly or be more explicit as to which measurements
they are comparing.
Response
Line 284–292: We have added the transverse diameter (TD) vs. the femoral head with the
maximum proximal width (MPW) data as follow.
Comment #15
Lines 303-304: I suggest the authors include a ratio of percentage that supports this
statement. Based on the overlapping measurements UCMP 81302 was a larger individual
than EESUT-PV-0001 so it is otherwise expected for the trochanter to be thinner in the
smaller of the two.
Response
Line 300–302: We have added Thickness of greater trochanter (TGT) vs. the femoral head
with the maximum proximal width (MPW) data in this sentence.
Comment #16
Line 313: I suggest the authors change "... (AMP 21), it..." to "... (AMP 21), where it..."
Response
Line 312: We have changed this sentence as follow.
Comment #17
Line 315: Are there measurements of the angle of the intertrochanteric crest than can be
added to table 1?
Response
Line 313–315 & Table 1: Intertrochanteric crests are not straight lines. So, it is difficult
to accurately measure with standards. Therefore, we could not add the angle of the
intertrochanteric crest.
Comment #18
Line 323: I suggest the authors change "... (USNM 26134) that have..." to "... (USNM
26134) which have..."
Response
Line 321: We have changed this sentence as follow.
Comment #19
Line 325: I suggest the authors change "... fracture surface of EESUT-PV-0001 has
thick..." to "... fractured surface of EESUT-PV-0001 shows a thick..."
Response
Line XX: We have changed this sentence as follow.
Comment #20
Line 455: Typo? "include ecological???"
Response
Line XX: We deleted “???”.
Comment #21
Table 1: At least some of the comparative measurements for Neoparadoxia cecilialina can
be obtained from Barnes (2013;Table 5). Including the maximum length (= greatest
length) and transverse diameter of femoral head.
Response
Table 1 & Line 97–99: We added measurements of femur of Neoparadoxia cecilialina
based on photograph measurements. According to these changes, we added one sentence
in Materials and Methods section.
