Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The field experiment was carried out in Xilamuren desert steppe, China. Root biomass,
belowground net primary production (BNPP) and plant community were measured with four
treatments: sheep grazing alone (SG), cattle grazing (CG), mixed grazing with cattle and sheep
(MG), no grazing (CK). SG had the highest BNPP and root turnover rate, while the CG had the
lowest BNPP and root turnover rate. Compared with other treatments, CG had a greater impact
on dominant tall grasses species in communities. SG could decrease community diversity. MG
eliminated the disadvantages of single-species grazing and was beneficial to community
diversity. And in conclusion, MG could lead to more sustainable grassland use. This paper give a
very interesting story, however, the writing is bad and the authors not clearly and logically
present the tables and figures and also language. Therefore the manuscript needs a major
revision to meet the goal of the journal of Royal Society Open Science.
1. The study goal in this manuscript is not very clear.
2. The summary section didn’t describe the main methods, results and conclusion logically and
clearly.
3. The figures and tables need to be modified and the normative need to be improved.
4. Deeper and logical discussion is needed to be shown in this manuscript.
5. English scientific writing in each part of manuscript needs to be enhanced. A lot grammar,
temporal, space problems are existed in this manuscript.
The followings are suggestions in detail.
Summary
The results of root turnover and BNPP under four grazing treatments were shown in the first half
part of summary, then plant community and diversity were shown. How grazing treatment affect
root turnover and BNPP? What is the relationship between root turnover, BNPP and plant
community, and the sustainable grassland use?
“Few have explored…” should be “Few studies have explored…”
“SG had a larger BNPP and root turnover rate, while the CG had smaller BNPP and root
turnover rate.” The comparative on BNPP and root turnover rate here were not clear. Here the
superlative form should be used.
“The MG treatment was between the CG and SG treatments. CK and MG were similar among all
the treatments in two of three methods”. These sentences are lacked of the real subject, and what
author want to explain is not clear.
Introduction
“…by altering plant species composition and affecting aboveground NPP” what is NPP? It
should be presented in manuscript.
“These advantages may be due to cattle and sheep having different preferences for plants both
with respect to species and plant parts selected during grazing, and a reduction in sward
rejection due to dung contamination”. The reference of these views should be given here.
Materials and methods
Overall, the “materials and methods” part is not specific enough.
For the part “Experimental design”, the grazing years (2014 and 2015?) need to be given in this
part.
“Root biomass was monitored by drilling holes and collecting and sampling the soil recovered,
while root growth was measured by root ingrowth cores…The root biomass sampling sites were
about 1 m away from the root ingrowth cores in each case” At the beginning of results part, “The
following is the results for the root biomass assessed by the ingrowth method”. What ingrowth
3
method was used to assess to, root biomass or root growth? As for the time of root sampling,
were drilling holes and root ingrowth cores carried out at the same time (each month of the
growing season)?
“Samples were separated at collection into three soil layers: three layers: 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm and
20–30 cm soil depth” The author should check the whole manuscript to avoid repeating
statements, or unscientific writing.
“At least 22 plots, 0.5 m ×0.5 m quadrat, were sampled diagonally across each block…Biomass
was assessed in twelve 0.5 m ×0.5 m plots in each block”. How many quadrats were investigated
in each fenced paddock?
How live root biomass, total root biomass, BNPP and root turnover were measured should be
also given detailed in part “materials and methods”, rather than be described in part “results”.
Significant level should be given in statistical analysis part.
Results
The logic of the results description needs to be improved. The figures and tables of the results
need to be modified and the normative need to be improved. It is suggested that figure 2 and 3
were also shown by “a” and “b” (i.e. Fig. 2a, 2b; Fig.3a, 3b) to help reader to understand easily.
Table 1 is suggested to change to figure and merge into figure 2. In table 2 the different letters for
Methods II need to be check, since 437.90 was bigger than 400.14. Besides, what is difference
between lower case letters and capital letters? The scale of Y axis in Figure 3a is suggested to be
denser.
In part “Live root biomass and total root biomass”, “There was no significant difference in root
biomass among all the treatments in June, July and August…Root biomass of the MG treatment
was significantly greater than the CK (p=0.093).” Root biomass of the MG treatment in which
month was significantly greater than that of the CK?
Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 showed stand live biomass and the relationships between root turnover rate and
the ratio of live root biomass. It is suggested that these relationships are also described in results
part of manuscript.
Discussion
The goal of this study is not clear. At the end of “Introduction” part, “Therefore, the goals of this
research were: from the field experiments, to characterize the distribution of root biomass during
a growing season in Inner Mongolian steppe grassland;…” but this goal is not shown in
“summary” part at all. According to the title of this manuscript, the focus of this study should be
exploring the impacts of grazing on root biomass and BNPP. However, these are not fully
discussed in “Discussion” part.
The two subtitles of this part are lengthy or too simple. The whole discussion part lack of casual
relationship, and structure needs to be adjusted.
“Aboveground biomass was measured by harvest method (Fig.3b), and reached the maximum in
August…. However, more root tended to occurred in surface soil after grazing (see appendix S1
in supplements), which was the same finding as other studies”. “We also analysed the correlation
between the ratio of live root mass to total root mass and the root turnover rate calculated by
three methods…The same correlation was also found by Fial [47] based on the study in meadow
stands of Czech Republic” These parts describe results, rather than discussion. Deeper discussion
is needed to be shown and explore how stem and root parameters are affected by season or
grazing.
“Legumes and forbs usually have relatively few roots, and their roots are thick. This means that
they have greater longevity and a slower turnover rate.” “Generally, the roots of Gramineae
grasses are fine and intensively dispersed”. The reference of these views should be given in these
parts.
“In this study, the cattle mainly ate S. krylovii and Leymus chinensis, which are two of the iconic
grassland species…In contrast, small herbivores prefer to eat species with a higher nutrient
content and smaller live biomass”. This paragraph shown how is cattle feeding characteristics,
and how cattle grazing affect vegetation. While how these feeding characteristics affect BNPP and
root turnover?
4
Conclusions
The authors need to make conclusion according to the goals of this study. How herbivores
grazing affect root biomass, BNPP and turnover? The author should also conclude it here.
Appendix
There are seven supporting information in appendix part. Only “appendix S1” can be found in
manuscript (discussion part). How is other appendix information support this study? All of them
need to be shown in this manuscript.
The appendix information should be simplified properly. Lots parameters in those supporting
figures or tables were lack of unit.
References
The format needs to be check carefully according to journal’s requirement. In this manuscript,
some journal’s titles are abbreviations, some titles are in full name.

Materials and methods
Overall, the “materials and methods” part is not specific enough.

*************************** Factors affecting root turnover and longevity include temperature, the availability of
water and nutrients, mycorrhizal fungi, and disturbances from herbivores, pathogens, and
microbes. Root turnover and longevity also differ among different plant species and plant
types (e.g. coarse vs. fine rooted, obligate vs. facultative mycotrophs)[38]. The root
turnover rate was higher in SG and lower in CG, as determined by all three methods in this
study except for the turnover rate calculated using Method III (no significant differences,
sig.=0.106). Legumes and forbs are dicotyledonous plants and usually their roots are
relatively sparser and deeper than the roots of Gramineae, which are monocotyledonous
with a fibrous root system[47,48]. In general, the roots of Gramineae are dense, while
roots of legumes and forbs are coarse with a taproot and a swollen junction (root crown) or
bulb that usually contains abundant carbohydrates. So roots of many legumes and forbs
are thicker than Gramineae within 0<U+2012>30 cm soils. This means that they have greater
longevity and a slower turnover rate as root turnover is mainly related to root diameter and
the amount of soluble sugars in the root system [39,49,50]. Roots with higher sugar
content and large diameters have a longer lifespan and slower turnover while a high
specific root length (ratio of root length to dry mass) often indicates a short lifespan [51].
In this study, there was a positive correlation among the four treatments between the
ratio of live root biomass to total root biomass and the root turnover rate among the four
treatments when measured using Methods I and III (Fig.5). The same correlation was also
found by Fial [52] based on the study in meadow stands of the Czech Republic .
Conclusion
In conclusion, our results demonstrated that the total root biomass of the community
showed a slightly decreasing trend while live root biomass increased with time during the
growing season. Herbivore assembly had different effects on root biomass and root
turnover depending on the species. SG had a greatest root biomass, BNPP and root
turnover rate, while the CG treatment had a smallest root biomass, BNPP and turnover
rate. The results for the MG treatment were between those for the CG and SG treatments.
Results for CK and MG were similar when estimated using two of the three calculation.
The differences among the four treatments can be attributed to changes in the aboveground
biomass of functional groups caused by animal herbivores. These findings based on root
growth conditions after the two years of experimental treatment in this study suggest that
mixed grazing by cattle and sheep are associated with more stable and sustainable plant
communities than CG or SG alone.
