The manuscript reports on the synthesis of the porphyrin derivative functionalized with 4 C60
cages. After optimization of the reaction with C60, the same reaction is also successfully
performed with N@C60-containing sample (0.15%), and it is proved that N@C60 is present in the
product. It is then claimed that such tetrafullerene molecule can be used for designing multiple
qubit architecture based on N@C60 and for the studies of the qubit-qubit interactions.
This is an interesting and promising work, but several questions have to be addressed first.
The synthesis of the tetramer seems to be a stepwise process, and the reaction mixture contains
also monomer, dimer, trimer etc. The main question how the authors prove that they really
archive the pure tetramer in the end. The authors use mass-spectrometry, but it is inconclusive.
Reaction mixture seems to show the presence of the trimer, and the mass-spectrum after
purification (Fig. S7) show only the tetramer range, so it is not clear if the trimer or dimer are still
there or not. One must show the full spectrum of the purified tetramer in ESI. It is also difficult to
decide if the trimer (if its signal is present) corresponds to the molecular ion, or is just a fragment.
Fragmentation and its influence on the evaluation of MS results should be discussed in ESI. As a
result, there is a lack experimental of data to prove isolation of the pure tetramer. Probably 1H
NMR does the job, but it is not clear at this moment how different the spectra of the trimer and
tetramer are. I would expect them to be similar. To summarize, the authors should provide more
convincing data on the isolation and purity of the tetramer.
Another point concerns the proposed use of the compound for the studies of the qubit-qubit
interactions. The authors claim that the tetramer is rigid with well-defined distanced between
fullerenes. However, the bridging groups are flexible and allow internal rotation. As a result, the
interfullerene distances can be changing continuously. The cartoon they show with the fixed N-N
distances is somewhat misleading.
Finally, the concentration of N@C60 used in the synthesis was very low, which prevents the
observation of any intramolecular interactions between N@C60 moieties. Thus, the possibility of
the qubit-qubit interaction is discussed in details but not demonstrated experimentally. I think,
the work will benefit dramatically if the reaction is performed with higher concentration of
N@C60 so that at least the molecules with two N@C60 units per molecule would be present in
detectable amount. The authors claim that their concept is suitable for combining 4 N@C60
molecules into one architecture, therefore it would be reasonable to demonstrate something going
beyond single N@C60 per tetramer.
Please also go carefully through the manuscript and check the number of compounds. 4,5, and 6
are mixed up sometimes .

This is a bold synthetic contribution, but really does not achieve the application goal because of
the low level of nitrogen encapsulation in the C60 cage. Furthermore, the characterization of the
final product is very weak with only a weak 1H NMR for proof of structure. Furthermore, the key
to understanding the purity of the final product is missing because the 1H NMR for the final
product doesn't show if any aldehyde is present (plotted only to ~9 ppm, structure 5, S2), but was
shown to over 10 ppm in the starting aldehyde (structure 3, S1, plotted to over 10 ppm)

Response to Referees
Reviewer 1:
“The authors use mass-spectrometry, but it is inconclusive. Reaction mixture seems to show the
presence of the trimer, and the mass-spectrum after purification (Fig. S7) show only the tetramer
range, so it is not clear if the trimer or dimer are still there or not. One must show the full spectrum
of the purified tetramer in ESI.”
The full spectrum for the isolated tetramer, showing only tetramer present has now been added to
the ESI (Figure S7).
“. . . there is a lack experimental of data to prove isolation of the pure tetramer. Probably 1H NMR
does the job, but it is not clear at this moment how different the spectra of the trimer and tetramer
are. I would expect them to be similar. To summarize, the authors should provide more convincing
data on the isolation and purity of the tetramer.”
The plot of the tetramer 1H NMR spectrum has been extended to 12 ppm, and shows no aldehyde
peak at approximately 10 ppm. Any remaining trimer would result in an aldehyde peak. Since this
cannot be seen, the tetramer must be isolated. A sentence explaining this has been added to the
manuscript.
“It is also difficult to decide if the trimer (if its signal is present) corresponds to the molecular ion, or
is just a fragment. Fragmentation and its influence on the evaluation of MS results should be
discussed in ESI.”
As mentioned, the spectrum of isolated tetramer is shown, with an ylide fragment present, but with
no trimer signal present. This shows that when using a laser power high enough to fragment the
tetramer, trimer is not one of the fragments formed. This means that the signal present in the reaction
mixture MALDI spectra at the trimer mass most likely indicates presence of trimer in the reaction
mixture.
A section addressing fragmentation has also been added to the ESI. The authors are unaware of any
reports of fragmentation in which an aldehyde group is left by the cleaving of fullerene, however there
s precedent for ylide formation in the literature (see references added to ESI).
“Another point concerns the proposed use of the compound for the studies of the qubit-qubit
interactions. The authors claim that the tetramer is rigid with well-defined distanced between
fullerenes. However, the bridging groups are flexible and allow internal rotation. As a result, the
interfullerene distances can be changing continuously. The cartoon they show with the fixed N-N
distances is somewhat misleading.”
The cartoon has been removed so as not to give the impression of fixed spin-to-spin distances and the
text of the manuscript has been clarified so as not to give the impression that the whole molecule is
rigid.
Since the flexible C-C bond lies in the same rotational axis as the O-C bond in the ester link, the effect
of both bonds on variation in spin-to-spin distance is equivalent to one of them being rigid. Due to
the large steric hindrance between fullerenes it seems very unlikely that an E conformation of the
ester bond is possible, so that only the Z conformation will be possible. This also reduces the potential
variation in spin-to-spin distance.
The difference between the closest and furthest spin-to-spin distances between adjacent spins is
around 11 Angstrom. The difference for spins on opposite sides of the porphyrin core is around 1
Angstrom. This means that the signal contribution from adjacent spins is likely to be broad and may
therefore make analysis of the resulting EPR spectrum more challenging.
It should be noted that there is likely to be a compromise between solubility, which was already poor
for the target tetramer, and flexibility.
Text has been added to the manuscript addressing the expected effect of varying spin-to-spin distance,
and simulated EPR spectra and dipolar coupling strengths for different states of bond rotation have
been added to the supplementary information.
“I think, the work will benefit dramatically if the reaction is performed with higher concentration of
N@C60 so that at least the molecules with two N@C60 units per molecule would be present in
detectable amount.”
The ion implantation method currently used to produce N@C60 yields a very large number of N@C60
molecules in one run and so is, in that respect, a promising method for producing these prospective
qubits. Nevertheless, the quantity produced in grams is still very small and of an average crude purity
of around 100 ppm (0.01%), relative to pristine C60. For reasonably accurate stoichiometry when
weighing reagents and to provide a sufficiently strong EPR signal it is only practical to attempt the
reaction with several milligrams of N@C60/C60 mixture. Around 30 ion implantation runs and extensive
HPLC purification were required to produce the enriched N@C60/C60 mixture (0.15% purity, 13.7 mg,
19 µmol) used to produce the single spin tetramer and, as such, this took several months of work. The
starting material purity at which the two-spin signal becomes stronger than the single spin signal is
40% and the purity at which one, two, three and four spin signals are at similar strengths is 60%. It
would therefore take months of ion implantation to produce a sufficiently pure mixture in usable
quantities and so it was not possibly to complete this before the re-submission deadline. However,
work is underway within the research group to investigate multi-spin interactions using scaffolds such
as the tetramer presented in this paper.
The single spin tetramer presented is proof of concept that the same scaffold can house several spins.
The clear EPR signal demonstrates the spin compatibility of the reaction and so there should be no
need to run the reaction with a higher spin concentration starting material simply to prove the
concept.

See final point in response to Reviewer 1.
“Furthermore, the characterization of the final product is very weak with only a weak 1H NMR for

The plot of the tetramer 1H NMR spectrum has been extended to 12 ppm, and shows no aldehyde
peak at approximately 10 ppm. Any remaining trimer would result in an aldehyde peak. Since this
cannot be seen, the tetramer must be isolated. A sentence explaining this has been added to the
manuscript.
We believe that this spectrum along with the clean MALDI mass spectrum and the UV-vis spectrum of
are sufficient evidence to confirm the purity of the final tetramer product. As mentioned in the
manuscript, the poor solubility of the product prevented us from obtaining a 13C NMR spectrum.
