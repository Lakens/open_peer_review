RSOS 181700: Temperature-dependent seminal recovery in the southern king crab
Katrin Pretterebner, Luis Miguel Pardo, Kurt Paschke
General evaluation:
This study well demonstrated the effects of temperature on the recovery rate of spermatophore
and seminal reserves in Lithodes santilla although data set is somewhat small. Results of this
study would help to understand effect of increasing temperature due to climate change (global
warming) on reproduction of lithodid crab resources, which would be of broad interest to the
readers.
I recommend this MS to be published in Royal Society Open Science.

Dear editors and authors,
basically the manuscript is interesting and straight forward which makes it generally suitable for
publication in RSOS. The present study tries to answer the question if and what way seminal
recovery in the southern king crab Lithodes santolla is temperature dependent which is of
relevance since L. santolla is important in fisheries in South America (e.g. in Chile) and only
males are caught which leaves fewer males to fertilize females. The authors used a clear
experimental setup and compared seminal recovery rates in terms of dry weight differences and
differences of histologically assessed sperm area for animals caught and kept at 9°C and 12°C.
The manuscript is written in a good English, only some minor things could be rephrased (see
attached pdf). Abstract, introduction, m&m and results are written in a clear and comprehensible
way. Besides some minor aspects (technical and textual) which should be checked (see attached
pdf) and if appropriate rephrased, some questions and contraries have arisen, listed in the
following (and in the attached pdf). This concerns strongest the discussion where some
conclusions (e.g. increased metabolisms through higher temperature decreases seminal recovery)
appeared which I cannot follow without some reliable references and a better argumentation.
I suggest to rephrase the major points in the discussion and to check the comments and
suggestions in the pdf. To enhance the method with sperm area at least three different regions of
each VD should be measured and checked for variability.
With kind regards,
Jonas Keiler
p2: If the authors want to use the plural of sperm I suggest to use the term "sperms"
p4: If the authors really meant "physiologically" they have to explain how they have proved this.
But I guess they meant "physically" in terms of body size.
p4: Since the animals are not genetrically identical and differ in size and most probably in age it
would be more appropriate in most cases to use the standard deviation.

See also e.g. Altman & Bland 2005 BMJ.
p4: What is the usual water temperature during mating season?
p5: How many slices per section were measured for sperm area?
p5: Sperm area should be put in relation to CL and/or diameter of VD.
p7: Why is group sample size 4 while in the method parts the authors wrote 5 per group?
p9: I would say that "brood" has already been fertilized. So better say "eggs".
p9: What about a seasonal aspect in the VDW increase? The authors collected the animals in
October and kept them for a month until the experiments started. The mating season normally
starts in late Nov to early Dec. So maybe there was either some delay in VD filling due to
catching or other artifical factors, or the males of the studied population just usually fill their VDs
later. I think a crucial information would be what temperature is normally present in the water
during mating!
p9: Is natural ejaculation in L. santolla an "all or something" action? So, during copulation, is the
whole mature spermatophore packet transferred leaving the VD completely empty? If eggs of
several females could be fertilized by one "load" in subsequent copulations what is the
disadvantage in this? Or what is the point here?
p11: I am not sure if I understood this correctly: Mating season for L. santolla is during southern
hemispheric summer (starting late Nov to Dec) when water temperature is normally slightly
increased. What is the normal temperature condition during mating in natural environment (and
does mating take place at a certain depth?) for L. santolla? I do not really understand why higher
water temperature of 12°C does effect seminal filling/maturing unfavorable if mating is usually
during higher water temperatures (in summer).
At least the author's explanation concerning metabolism is not convincing for me.
p18: N-numbers should be given in all figure legends.
p21: To be honest, this figure is not really informative. At least, areas with sperm should be
marked with a transparent color or in a similar way.

Dear editors and authors,
The revised version of the manuscript was basically improved following the reviewer's
comments and suggestions.
Although I am still not convinced of the hypothesis that a decreased metabolism increases
seminal production by providing more energy for this process, the actual version of the text
provides interesting data on seminal depletion in the commercially import king crab L. santolla
and potentially useful aspects for more sustainable fisheries. However, the latter point could be
provided with a clearer statement on how or if at all the author's findings suggest
improvements/changes for fishery of L. santolla.
I suggest the present manuscript to be published in RSOS after correcting the following points
and further remarks in the pdf attached (Appendix B).

RSOS 181700: Temperature-dependent seminal recovery in the southern king
crab Lithodes santolla
Katrin Pretterebner, Luis Miguel Pardo, Kurt Paschke
We would like to thank the reviewers for the revision and really appreciate
their detailed comments to improve the manuscript. We have responded to all
of the reviewers' comments by making appropriate modifications to our
manuscript.
Responses to Reviewer 1
L. 80-81: Reproductive season varies depending on the region (between north
and southern parts of their distribution)?
We included the following phrases in the introduction for better
understanding: “Biological information of L. santolla is largely restricted to
the southern limit of distribution (Beagle Channel) without data describing
reproductive aspects of males derived from their northern distributional limit.
Intraspecific latitudinal variability in the reproductive pattern and traits has
been documented in crustacean species. Consequently, L. santolla in its
northern distributional limit (this study) is exposed to different prevailing
environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, photoperiod) which possibly have
led to variations in the reproductive pattern between the southern and northern
limits of its distribution.”.
[Materials and Methods]
L. 107-109: For readers’ understanding, provide picture and/or movie from
the time of the electroejaculation.
Figure 1a shows a picture of the placement of electrodes during
electroejaculation and gonopores where ejaculate is extruded. For further
details, methods are described in Soundarapandian (2013) which is cited.
L. 111-113: Describe time periods when authors conducted first and second
experiments
The following phrase was added to Material and Methods: “Both temperature
conditions were conducted simultaneously from mid-November to mid-
December 2016.”.
[Results]

L. 275-281: As a result, what method do you think the best to estimate the
recovery rate of seminal reserves? Please describe.
We included that following section in the discussion: “We used the
two methods to estimate recovery complementary, as they refer to distinct
components of the reproductive structures. Dry weight of the vasa deferentia
represents the total of sperm and seminal fluids, while the standardized sperm
area relates solely to the relative sperm amount. We suggest that the most
appropriate method to be applied in further studies depends on the specific
research question.”.
L. 306-320: Delete the conclusion section because this section (L. 307-320) is
redundant.
The conclusion section was shorted and now is more concise
summarizing only the most important findings of the study. The conclusion
section was not deleted completely to coincide with the format of the journal
Royal Society Open Science.
Responses to Reviewer 2
p2: If the authors want to use the plural of sperm I suggest to use the term
"sperms".
Now, the term “sperm” is used in singular. It was corrected in all
relevant phrases.
p4: If the authors really meant "physiologically" they have to explain how
they have proved this. But I guess they meant "physically" in terms of body
size. The right term is “physically”.
Indeed we wanted to refer to “physiologically” mature and included
the corresponding citation. “Physiologically” mature refers to individuals
which are able to develop gonads. Southern king crab males reach
physiological maturity in the Beagle channel at a size of 75 mm CL. The crabs
used in the experiment were = 98 mm CL and therefore can be considered as
“physiologically” mature.
p4: Since the animals are not genetically identical and differ in size and most
probably in age it would be more appropriate in most cases to use the standard
deviation.
See also e.g. Altman & Bland 2005 BMJ.
As suggested by the reviewer, instead of using the standard error, we
now state the mean with the standard deviation in the results section and in
figure 2.
p4: What is the usual water temperature during mating season?
We indicated the usual water temperature during the mating season
and included the following phrase: “The zone of origin of the individuals of
this study is located close to its northern limit of distribution where crabs
reproduce in shallow waters and mean temperatures present during mating are
9°C (winter mean) and 12°C (annual mean).”.
p5: How many slices per section were measured for sperm area?
We added the following phrase to Material and Methods:”One slice of
the middle section of the vasa deferentia, which corresponds to the section
where spermatophore reserves are located, was used to estimate area covered
by sperm in the lumen.”.
p5: Sperm area should be put in relation to CL and/or diameter of VD.
As suggested by the reviewer, now we present [(sperm area/CL)
*1000] to avoid influence of crab size.
p7: Why is group sample size 4 while in the method parts the authors wrote 5
per group?
Sample sizes are now stated explicitly for each group.
p9: I would say that "brood" has already been fertilized. So better say "eggs".
We thank the reviewer for this observation. “Brood” was changed to
“oocytes”.
p9: What about a seasonal aspect in the VDW increase? The authors collected
the animals in October and kept them for a month until the experiments
started. The mating season normally starts in late Nov to early Dec. So maybe
there was either some delay in VD filling due to catching or other artifical
factors, or the males of the studied population just usually fill their VDs later.
I think a crucial information would be what temperature is normally present in
the water during mating!
In the Beagle Channel the mating season of L. santolla starts in late
November to early December and lasts approximately one month. However,
biological information of L. santolla is largely restricted to the southern limit
of distribution (Beagle Channel) without data describing reproductive aspects
of males derived from their northern distributional limit. Intraspecific
latitudinal variability in the reproductive pattern and traits has been
documented in crustacean species. Consequently, L. santolla in its northern
distributional limit (this study) is exposed to different prevailing
environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, photoperiod) which possibly have
led to variations in the reproductive pattern between the southern and northern
limits of its distribution, and L. santolla in its northern distributional limit
possibly has a different window of reproduction. For this reason we did not
conclude a seasonal aspect of seminal recovery in L. santolla in its northern
limit of distribution. As requested we included the usual water temperature
during the mating season assuming a larger window of reproduction of this
species but from the northern limit of its distribution and included the
following phrase: “The zone of origin of the individuals of this study is
located close to its northern limit of distribution where crabs reproduce in
shallow waters and mean temperatures present during mating are 9°C (winter
mean) and 12°C (annual mean).”.
p9: Is natural ejaculation in L. santolla an "all or something" action? So,
during copulation, is the whole mature spermatophore packet transferred
leaving the VD completely empty? If eggs of several females could be
fertilized by one "load" in subsequent copulations what is the disadvantage in
this? Or what is the point here?
In general, we restructured the discussion and where necessary
rephrased for more clarity. In L. santolla the amount of ejaculate delivered
during one mating is unknown. Details about lithodid mating ability are
described only in Paralithodes camtschaticus and P. brevipes which partially
transfer sperm of their reserves during one mating resembling a “something”
action. Lithodid crabs are polygamous. The crucial point is that, for example,
in P. brevipes an increase in the mating frequency reduces the sperm number
ejaculated, the percentage of spawning females and female fertilization rate.
After the second successive mating of small males (<100 mm CL) partial or
null fertilization occurs in females. Consequently, crustaceans with slow
seminal recovery in a male-only fishery which have mated repeatedly might
have depleted seminal reserves especially as the reproductive season
progresses.
p11: I am not sure if I understood this correctly: Mating season for L. santolla
is during southern hemispheric summer (starting late Nov to Dec) when water
temperature is normally slightly increased. What is the normal temperature
condition during mating in natural environment (and does mating take place at
a certain depth?) for L. santolla? I do not really understand why higher water
temperature of 12°C does effect seminal filling/maturing unfavorable if
mating is usually during higher water temperatures (in summer).
At least the author's explanation concerning metabolism is not convincing for
me.
Lithodid crabs perform bathymetrical migrations which are associated
with reproduction, where mating takes place in shallow waters. These
reproductive migrations have been observed in the Beagle channel but
information is fragmented. The zone of origin of the individuals of this study
is located close to its northern limit of distribution where crabs reproduce in
shallow waters and mean temperatures present during mating are 9°C (winter
mean) and 12°C (annual mean) (see explanation above for likely varying
reproductive pattern between the southern and northern limit of distribution).
L. santolla can be fished at sites between 5°C and 12°C along its range
of distribution. The higher water temperature of 12°C likely affects recovery
seminal reserves unfavorable because the origin of the crabs from our study is
from its northern distributional limit and 12°C may be close to the threshold
of temperature tolerance of L. santolla. For example, deep-water
representatives of the Lithodinae sub-family were excluded from waters
exceeding temperatures of 13°C.
We added two reliable references (book section of Willmer et al. 2005
and Paper of Pörtner 2002) to justify that lower temperature implies a
reduction of the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of the organism and to better
explain that therefore more energy may be available to be assigned to
reproduction (faster seminal recovery at 9°C).
p18: N-numbers should be given in all figure legends.
We added N-numbers to all figure legends.
p21: To be honest, this figure is not really informative. At least, areas with
sperm should be marked with a transparent color or in a similar way.
We modified figure 5 for better visibility of sperm areas. Now, figure 5
now shows an overview of a histological cross-section of the vasa deferentia
of L. santolla and a detailed view thereof displaying spermatophores filled
with sperm.

30
31
21 Male-biased fishery management can provoke depletion of seminal reserves, which is the primary cause of sperm
32
33 22 limitation. To identify factors, which contribute to the vulnerability to depletion of seminal reserves is therefore a
34
35 23 priority. The present study aimed to determine the effect of temperature on the recovery rate of sperm and seminal
36
37 24 reserves after their depletion in Lithodes santolla, an important fishery resource in southern Chile. Sperm and
38
39 25 seminal reserves were not fully recovered within 30 days. Temperature significantly affected seminal recovery: after
40
41 26 30 days the recovery index increased to 40% and 21% at 9°C and 12°C, respectively. The twice as fast seminal
42
43 27 recovery at 9°C may be explained by the zone of origin of the individuals of this study (northern distributional limit)
44
45 28 and 12°C may be close to the threshold of temperature tolerance. L. santolla populations subject to intense male-
46
47 29 only fisheries may be vulnerable to depletion of seminal reserves and a climate change scenario could additionally
48
49 30 aggravate the risk of seminal depletion in L. santolla in its northern distributional limit.

4 34 1. Introduction
5
6
7 35 Most crustacean fisheries are managed by a male-biased or exclusively male extraction strategy [1].
8
9
36 However, harvesting large males can trigger changes in the mating dynamics of a population, thereby reduce overall
10
37 reproductive success [2,3]. The population structure can be altered by selectively harvesting large males due to
11
12 38 skewing the operational sex-ratio towards females and decreasing the average size of males [4]. A reduced density
13
14 39 of males in the population may affect the frequency of encounters of females with males and cause difficulties for
15
16 40 females to find mates [5]. Due to a lower availability of dominant males, available males potentially mate more
17
18 41 frequently than in non-fished populations [6]. Hence, males might deplete their sperm reserves faster than they are
19
20 42 able to recover them, and transfer reduced sperm to females, an issue which has been termed sperm depletion [7–
21
22 43 11].
23
24 44 Traditionally, sperm has been assumed to be cheap in production [12,13]. However, sperm is usually
25
26 45 delivered along with seminal fluids and the production of ejaculates is slow and costly for males [14]. The capacity
27
28 46 of male decapods to transfer sperm is limited by the exhaustion of both sperm and seminal fluids (e.g. seminal
29
30 47 reserves) and their regeneration rate [15]. Therefore, an important factor involved in seminal depletion may be the
31
32
48 time period necessary to fully recover seminal reserves after mating. Until now, sperm regeneration rates have been
33
49 studied in few decapod species. The subtropical blue crab Callinectes sapidus requires 9–20 days to recover its vasa
34
35 50 deferentia weight after 2 consecutive matings [7]. In contrast, in the anomuran species Paralithodes brevipes and
36
37 51 Hapalogaster dentata, sperm in the vasa deferentia is not fully recovered even after 28 and 20 days, respectively,
38
39 52 after depletion [16,17]. In crab species with a rapid seminal recovery rate, males might be less vulnerable to seminal
40
41 53 depletion. Hence, it is fundamental to determine the recovery rate of seminal reserves in individual crab species and
42
43 54 identify factors, which contribute to the variability in the recovery period.
44
45 55 Crustaceans are ectothermic, meaning that their body temperature depends on the water temperature.
46
47 56 Temperature determines the velocity of the energetic metabolism and regulates most biological and behavioural
48
49 57 patterns. Environmental factors such as temperature might modulate the male´s ability to regenerate seminal
50
51 58 material apart from intrinsic ones (e.g. moult state after spermatophore extrusion [18]). So far, the effect of
52
53 59 temperature on the production of spermatophores has only been studied in a commercially important penaeid shrimp
54
55
60 species in the context of aquaculture research [19]. In male Penaeus setiferus, the regeneration process was

3 61 estimated according to visual evaluation of the spermatophores after electric shock-induced ejaculation (i.e.
4
5 62 electroejaculation). Temperature affected the period necessary for regeneration; in this tropical species
6
7 63 spermatophores were replaced faster at 33°C (within 144 h) compared to 25°C (192 h), however, at cost of a
8
9 64 reduced sperm quality [19]. Bugnot and López Greco [20] reported that sperm production in the red claw crayfish
10
11 65 Cherax quadricarinatus was higher between 27°C and 29°C compared to 23°C or 31°C. The effect of temperature
12
13 66 on the recovery rate of sperm and seminal reserves in crustaceans has not been evaluated and discussed in the
14
15 67 context of seminal depletion triggered by selective fishery.
16
17 68 The southern king crab Lithodes santolla (Molina, 1782) constitutes one of the most important fishery
18
19
69 resources in the Region of Magallanes and Chilean Antarctica (Chilean five-year mean landing around 5965 tons
20
70 [21]). L. santolla is distributed in subantarctic and cold-temperate environments from the Beagle Channel
21
22 71 (southernmost parts of Argentina and Chile) along the south-eastern Pacific to Talcahuano [22,23] and along the
23
24 72 south-western Atlantic in the deeper parts of the continental slope off Uruguay [24]. Chilean fishery of L. santolla
25
26 73 has been concentrated mainly in Porvenir, Punta Arenas, Puerto Natales and around the island of Chiloé. The
27
28 74 extraction of L. santolla is regulated by the strategy of “SSS” (size, sex and season). Harvesting females is
29
30 75 prohibited year-round and the fishery is closed in the Region of Magallanes and Chilean Antarctica from December
31
32 76 1st until June 30th and in the northern regions (X, XIV and XI) from December 1st until January 31st. The minimum
33
34 77 harvest size (carapace length (CL)) for L. santolla depends on the location: 120 mm south and 100 mm north of 46°
35
36 78 S, respectively.
37
38 79 The annual reproductive cycle of L. santolla in the Beagle Channel starts in late November to early
39
40 80 December and mating pairs can be found in the population for approximately one month [25]. Precopulatory mate-
41
42
81 guarding and mating occur between an old-shelled male and a female, which has recently moulted. The male
43
82 reproductive system of L. santolla consists of paired testes, secretory canals and vasa deferentia [26]. In the testes,
44
45 83 development occurs from the spermatogonia to spermatozoid which are packaged in spermatophores and stored in
46
47 84 the vasa deferentia [27]. The vasa deferentia are further connected to the fifth pereiopods where, through an aperture
48
49 85 located at the basipodite, the spermatophores are extruded during copulation [26]. External fertilization takes place
50
51 86 immediately after oviposition within the brood chamber formed by the pleon flapped below the cephalothorax.
52
53 87 Females of L. santolla brood the embryos that are attached to their pleopods for approximately 9–10 months and
54
55 88 larvae hatch between mid-September and October [28]. Fecundity (number of eggs per brood) increases with female

3 89 size and L. santolla produces between 5500 and 60000 eggs per clutch [29]. Even though, fundamental knowledge
4
5 90 on this species exists [30], studies focusing on male reproductive aspects are scarce [27]. Moreover, biological
6
7 91 information of L. santolla is largely restricted to the southern limit of distribution (Beagle Channel) without data
8
9 92 describing reproductive aspects of males derived from their northern distributional limit. Intraspecific latitudinal
10
11 93 variability in the reproductive pattern and traits has been documented in crustacean species [31–34]. Consequently,
12
13 94 L. santolla in its northern distributional limit (this study) is exposed to different prevailing environmental conditions
14
15 95 (e.g. temperature, photoperiod) which possibly have led to variations in the reproductive pattern between the
16
17 96 southern and northern limits of its distribution.
18
19
97 As exploitation of this lithodid is regulated by a large male-only management strategy, the target species
20
98 may be susceptible to depletion of seminal reserves which makes it a suitable model species to identify factors that
21
22 99 contribute to the vulnerability to seminal depletion. This is important for fisheries and it is crucial to obtain a greater
23
24 100 understanding of males´ reproductive biology in L. santolla. As L. santolla inhabits cold seawater environments and
25
26 101 has a low energy metabolism, a slow sperm and seminal recovery rate after depletion of seminal reserves is
27
28 102 expected. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of temperature on the recovery rate of sperm and
29
30 103 seminal reserves after their depletion in L. santolla from their northern distributional limit.

38
39 107 Physiologically mature similar-sized males of L. santolla (physiological maturity in the Beagle Channel
40
41 108 <U+02C3>75 mm CL, see [35]) were collected in October 2016 (caught with commercial traps) from the Seno de Reloncaví,
42
43 109 X region, Chile (41°45´47.1´´ S; 73°05´20.1´´ W) which corresponds to the northern limit of distribution of this
44
45 110 species. Individuals were transported to the Laboratorio de Ecofisiología de Crustáceos (LECOFIC) of the
46
47 111 Universidad Austral de Chile in Puerto Montt. Crabs were acclimated in the laboratory for approximately one month
48
49 112 prior to the start of the experiment with flowing seawater, air supply and ad libitum food (Mytilus chilensis). Both
50
51 113 temperature conditions were conducted simultaneously from mid-November to mid-December 2016.
52
53 114 To simulate depletion of seminal reserves and to ensure standardization of initial condition of males

3 116 electric shocks of 12 V AC [36]. Electrodes were placed ventrally on the soft section of the opened pleon (figure
4
5 117 1a). After seminal depletion (i.e. no ejaculation after electrostimulation) individuals were maintained in two tanks at
6
7 118 9°C and 12°C each with flowing seawater (32 psu), air supply (O2 saturation was guaranteed through bubbling and
8
9 119 movement of the water by pumps) and ad libitum food. The first experimental temperature of 9.2 ± 0.09°C (mean ±
10
11 120 s.e.) was provided by a chiller. The second experimental temperature of 12.04 ± 0.06°C (mean ± s.e.) was
12
13 121 maintained using submersible aquarium heaters with digital controllers. These two experimental temperatures are
14
15 122 referred to as 9°C and 12°C in the text, reflecting the mean sea surface temperature in the study area, Seno de
16
17 123 Reloncaví, during the austral winter (May–August, 9°C) and throughout the year (12°C) [37]. Individuals in the
18
19
124 lower temperature condition were acclimatized for 2–3 days through a gradual temperature decrease until reaching
20
125 9°C. Temperature was measured every day with a digital thermometer (WTW Cond 330i with sensor WTW
21
22 126 TetraCon 325; precision of 0.1°C). To identify crabs individually they were marked with numbered cable ties.
23
24 127 To determine the effect of temperature on the recovery rate of sperm and seminal reserves, individuals were
25
26 128 sacrificed after 0, 15 and 30 days. Crabs without electroejaculation were used as controls and sacrificed after 0 and
27
28 129 30 days.
29
30 130 After the corresponding experimental period animals were sacrificed (thermal shock -80°C for 15 minutes)
31
32 131 and both vasa deferentia and the hepatopancreas were dissected (figure 1b). The left vasa deferentia were used to
33
34 132 estimate their dry weight (seminal material, n = 4–5 in each group) and to calculate the vasosomatic index (VSI, n =
35
36 133 4). The VSI has been suggested as an indicator of the reproductive condition of males [8,15,38]. The VSI (expressed
37
38 134 as a percentage) was calculated: VSI = (2 * VDW/BDW) * 100, with VDW being the dry weight of the left vasa
39
40 135 deferentia (oven dried for 5 days at 70°C and weighted to a precision of 0.0001 g) and BDW being the dry weight of
41
42
136 the complete body (oven dried for 5 days at 70°C and weighted to a precision of 0.01 g). The weight of the left vasa
43
137 deferentia was doubled to calculate the VSI of the whole male reproductive system. For the estimation of the VSI,
44
45 138 dry weight of crabs without legs and chelae were used to increase accuracy.
46
47 139 The right vasa deferentia were used to examine histological cross-sections (n = 3–5 in each group) and to
48
49 140 calculate the area covered by sperm (stored in spermatophores) in the vasa deferentia lumen. To prepare histological
50
51 141 cross-sections, the right vasa deferentia were fixed in Bouin solution for at least two days. Then, samples were
52
53 142 sequentially passed through a 50–70–80–96–100% ethanol series for 30 min each, 100% ethanol–butylic alcohol (1 :
54
55 143 1 v/v) for 30 min and butylic alcohol for 25 min (twice). Samples were embedded in paraffin and serial sections of 6

3 144 µm were cut and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. One slice of the middle section of the vasa deferentia, which
4
5 145 corresponds to the section where spermatophore reserves are located [35], was used to estimate area covered by
6
7 146 sperm in the lumen(figures 2a and b). Photos were taken with a digital camera (Q Imaging Go-3) of histological
8
9 147 cross-sections under a light microscope (OLYMPUS BX51) at 10 × magnification for further analysis. Photos were
10
11 148 analysed using the image processing programme ImageJ 1.52a [39]. The area covered by sperm was identified
12
13 149 through adjusting the brightness of the colour threshold and measured. The sperm area was then doubled to calculate
14
15 150 the sperm coverage of the paired vasa deferentia Sperm area is presented in relation to CL and multiplied by 1000.
16
17 151 The hepatopancreas was extracted and the dry weight was determined (n = 5 in each group). The
18
19 152 hepatosomatic index (HSI) was calculated: HSI = (HDW/BDW) * 100. HDW was the dry weight of the
20
21
153 hepatopancreas and BDW was the dry weight of the animal without legs. In crustaceans, the hepatopancreas is an
22
154 organ involved in digestive processes and it is important in the assimilation of energy, storage and mobilization of
23
24 155 resources during the moulting process. Thus, the size and weight of the hepatopancreas provide a good indication of
25

31 158 2.1 Data analyses and statistics
32
33 159 We established a recovery index (RI), which refers to the recovery rate of seminal material expressed as the
34
35 160 percentage change in dry weight of the vasa deferentia between initially electroejaculating individuals (n = 5) and
36
37 161 after the corresponding experimental period (n = 5 each) in relation to dry weight of the vasa deferentia of the
38
39 162 control (i.e. without electroejaculation, n = 4). The dry weight of the vasa deferentia remaining after
40
41 163 electroejaculation was not considered. To assess the net change rate of VDW of the control animals (i.e. natural
42
43 164 fluctuation of the vasa deferentia without electroejaculation), change rate (in %) of vasa deferentia dry weight after
44
45 165 30 days (n = 5 each) in relation to the initial vasa deferentia dry weight (n = 4) was calculated for 9°C and 12°C.
46
47 166 Following parameters were used in the RI in electroejaculated individuals and the net change rate of VDW
48
49 167 in the control animals. VDW = Vasa deferentia dry weight; E = Crab electroejaculated at beginning of experiment;
50
51
168 C = Control (i.e. without electroejaculation); t0 = At beginning of the experiment; and t1 = After corresponding time

34
186 histological sections and HDW between different recovery periods, the two temperature conditions (9°C and 12°C),
35

3 196 Initial mean dry weight of paired vasa deferentia (VDW) of L. santolla without electroejaculation was 35.3
4
5 197 ± 9.0 mg (range = 26.2–43.4 mg, figure 3). After electroejaculation the mean VDW accounted for 14.8 ± 7.4 mg
6
7 198 (range = 6.8–24.3 mg). Electroejaculation decreased the VDW 58.2% compared to the initial mean value. The mean
8
9 199 vasosomatic index (VSI) at the beginning of the experiment was 0.047 ± 0.007%.
10
11 200 Seminal reserves of L. santolla were not fully recovered within 30 days after electroejaculation at none of
12
13 201 the experimental temperatures (figure 4). The recovery index (RI) at 9°C increased significantly between 15 and 30
14
15 202 days. After 30 days the RI was significantly larger in seawater of 9°C compared to 12°C. Also, the change rate of
16
17 203 VDW in the control after 30 days was significantly larger at 9°C than 12°C (figure 5).
18
19 204 Initial mean standardized sperm area of the paired vasa deferentia was 0.5 ± 0.26 (range = 0.28–0.88; figure
20
21 205 6). Electroejaculation decreased the standardized sperm area significantly compared to the initial value (mean after
22
23 206 electroejaculation = 0.2 ± 0.09; range = 0.07–0.26; planned comparison (LSM), t-value = 2.72, p = 0.013).
24
25 207 Standardized sperm area was changed neither within 15 nor 30 days after electroejaculation. Neither after 15 nor 30
26
27 208 days a recovery existed in terms of differences in standardized sperm area between 9°C and 12°C.
28
29 209 At the beginning of the experiment mean dry weight of the hepatopancreas (HDW) and the hepatosomatic
30
210 index (HSI) were 5.61 ± 2.72 g (range = 2.61–12.24 g) and 7.06 ± 1.77%, respectively. Mean HDW was
31
32
33
211 significantly increased after 15 days only at 12°C (planned comparison (LSM), t-value = -2.20, p = 0.03; figure 7).
34
212 After 30 days mean HDW was significantly increased at both experimental temperatures (9°C: t-value = -2.61, p =
35
36 213 0.01; and 12°C: t-value = -2.62, p = 0.01) and hepatopancreas weighed 10.57 ± 1.34 g and 10.02 ± 2.03 g at 9°C and
37
38
214 12°C, respectively. In the control individuals HDW was significantly increased after 30 days at 9°C (mean = 11.59 ±
39
40
215 2.00 g; t-value = -4.03, p = 0.0002) and 12°C (mean = 12.88 ± 3.33 g; t-value = -4.9, p = 0.00002). HDW did not
41
42
216 differ after 30 days between initially electroejaculated and control individuals, neither at 9°C (t-value = -1.42, p =

Seminal recovery in king crab 9

4 219 4. Discussion
5
6
7 220 Sperm and seminal reserves of L. santolla were not fully recovered within 30 days after depletion through
8
9
221 electroejaculation, neither at 9°C nor 12°C. However, temperature significantly affected recovery of seminal stock
10
222 and L. santolla replenished seminal reserves faster at 9°C than 12°C. Effect of temperature on sperm recovery was
11
12 223 not that pronounced and a trend of increase and decrease of the standardized sperm area at 9°C and 12°C,
13
14 224 respectively, was detected.
15
16 225 L. santolla can be fished at sites between 5°C and 12°C along its range of distribution. The zone of origin
17
18 226 of the individuals of this study is located close to its northern limit of distribution where crabs reproduce in shallow
19
20 227 waters and mean temperatures present during mating are 9°C (winter mean) and 12°C (annual mean). Hall and
21
22 228 Thatje (2009) concluded that deep-water representatives of the Lithodinae sub-family were excluded from waters
23
24 229 exceeding temperatures of 13°C. The experimental temperature 12°C may be close to the threshold of temperature
25
26 230 tolerance of L. santolla. Temperature had a significant effect on the recovery rate of seminal reserves in L. santolla
27
28 231 after 30 experimental days. The faster seminal material recovery rate in seawater of 9°C than 12°C after 30 days
29
30 232 may be explained by the consequences of a higher metabolic rate at 12°C. It is known that, lower temperature
31
32
233 implies a reduction of the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of the organism [45,46] and in this condition likely more
33
234 energy is available to be assigned to reproduction. The HDW has nearly doubled during 30 days. At 12°C crabs
34
35 235 started to accumulate energy in the hepatopancreas already after 15 days but then did not immediately invest energy
36
37 236 in the reproductive system during the duration of the experiment. Probably at 9°C energy of the hepatopancreas was
38
39 237 converted into seminal material more efficiently because less of their available energy was spent into the SMR.
40
41 238 Similarly, one-year-old juveniles of L. santolla can tolerate seawater between 6°C and 15°C, however their preferred
42
43 239 temperature is 9°C [47] with a maximum growth and moulting rate [48,49].
44
45 240 Temperature-dependent seminal recovery and seasonal variability in the vertical distribution of temperature
46
47 241 in the zone of study [50–55] suggest the importance of bathymetrical migrations which could be associated with
48
49 242 moving to the optimum temperature to promote recovery of seminal reserves. Seasonal migrations associated with
50
51 243 reproduction are an characteristic of lithodid crabs [26] and are well described in lithodid species from the Northern
52
53 244 Hemisphere [26], in contrast, little details are available on these migratory movements in the Southern Hemisphere.
54
55
245 Observations of migrations of L. santolla exist mainly from the Magellan region and the Atlantic Ocean in

3 246 Argentina where male and female crabs have been observed to migrate to shallow waters in October and November
4
5 247 to reproduce where mating takes place in December and subsequently both sexes return to deeper waters [56].
6
7 248 Timing and magnitude of the pattern of migration in L. santolla from northern parts of their distribution is unknown.
8
9 249 However, migration of L. santolla in the Seno de Reloncaví and interior waters of Chiloé to deeper and cooler
10
11 250 waters after reproduction could be substantial to recover seminal material stock in a more efficient form.
12
13 251 Effect of temperature on the recovery of sperm was not that pronounced (non-significant changes) as
14
15 252 seminal recovery, however, a trend of increase and decrease of the standardized sperm area in the vasa deferentia
16
17 253 lumen was detected at 9°C and 12°C, respectively. We suggest that the estimation of area covered by sperm in the
18
19
254 present study has restrictions due to small sample size and possibly little statistical power.
20
255 Our results of incomplete sperm and seminal recovery during 30 days, correspond with the previous
21
22 256 description of a long spermatogenesis in this species from a different population in the Beagle Channel [27] and in
23
24 257 the red king crab P. camtschaticus which inhabits the Northern Hemisphere [57,58]. Direct comparison of the
25
26 258 previously described period of spermatogenesis in L. santolla and annual pattern of sperm fullness in the vasa
27
28 259 deferentia [27] is avoided, due to large latitudinal differences between the study zones and likely varying
29
30 260 reproductive traits [33]. Similarly as the results of our recovery rates, in the spiny king crab P. brevipes and in the
31
32 261 stone crab H. dentata, sperm number in the vasa deferentia are not fully recovered even after 28 and 20 days,
33
34 262 respectively, after depletion [16,17]. In contrast, in large males of C. sapidus, weight of the vasa deferentia is
35
36 263 recovered relatively fast and recovery requires 9 to 20 days after two consecutive matings [7]. The majority of
37
38 264 experiments investigating sperm recovery rate in the context of sperm depletion was not conducted under stable
39
40 265 experimental temperatures which makes it difficult to compare results among each other (seawater temperature
41
42
266 ranges: -0.6–4.3°C [16], 10–19.9°C [17], 0–29°C [7]). In contrast, in aquaculture research temperature affects the
43
267 sperm replenishment period in the shrimp Litopenaeus setiferus after sperm depletion through electroejaculation (8
44
45 268 days at 25°C, 7 days at 30°C and 6 days at 33°C [19]). In another tropical penaeid, spermatophores are regenerated
46
47 269 after manual extrusion in 16 days (P. brasiliensis: 27°C [18]).
48
49 270 Apart from fluctuating temperature conditions in some studies, it is difficult to make interspecific
50
51 271 comparisons due to inconsistency in the method applied to deplete seminal reserves (electroejaculation vs. varying
52
53 272 number of successive natural matings) and the type of information reported related to the male reproductive organ
54
55 273 (sperm number in the vasa deferentia – vasa deferentia weight – macroscopic visual inspection). We used the two

3 274 methods to estimate recovery complementary, as they refer to distinct components of the reproductive structures.
4
5 275 Dry weight of the vasa deferentia represents the total of sperm and seminal fluids, while the standardized sperm area
6
7 276 relates solely to the relative sperm amount. We suggest that the most appropriate method to be applied in further
8
9 277 studies depends on the specific research question. In the present study, electroejaculation was a useful, fast and
10
11 278 standardized method to artificially induce ejaculation and deplete sperm and seminal material stocks. While our
12
13 279 manipulative approach with electroejaculation provides a good basis, it would be favourable in a next step to
14
15 280 determine the amount of ejaculate delivered during one mating and the number of possible successive matings for a
16
17 281 better understanding of the male reproductive biology and interpretation of our results. Details about lithodid mating
18
19
282 ability are described only in P. camtschaticus and P. brevipes which partially transfer sperm of their reserves during
20
283 one mating [4,59]. Lithodid crabs are polygamous. For example, the male king crab P. camtschaticus is able to mate
21
22 284 with up to seven females and result in full egg clutches [59]. However, the maximum possible mating frequency of
23
24 285 males of L. santolla is unknown [60]. In P. brevipes an increase in the mating frequency reduces the sperm number
25
26 286 ejaculated, the percentage of spawning females and female fertilization rate. After the second successive mating of
27
28 287 small males (<100 mm CL) partial or null fertilization occurs in females [4]. Crustaceans with slow seminal
29
30 288 recovery in a male-only fishery which have mated repeatedly might have depleted seminal reserves especially as the
31
32 289 reproductive season progresses. Temporal variation of sperm reserves has been observed in P. brevipes and the
33
34 290 proportion of depleted males increased throughout the reproductive season [4].
35
36 291 L. santolla is distributed over a wide range extending over 19° latitudes in the Pacific [22,23,61]. Along the
37
38 292 coast of Chile the sea surface temperature shows a gradient and is decreasing from north to south [62]. Therefore, L.
39
40 293 santolla is exposed to regional differences in seawater temperature. The effect of temperature on the seminal
41
42
294 recovery rate may generate variations in the reproductive potential of males. Males located close to the northern
43
295 distributional limit have a slower seminal recovery rate and after successive matings may deplete their reserves
44
45 296 faster in contrast to individuals inhabiting more southern or deeper habitats with a temperature closer to 9°C. This
46
47 297 fact could impact even greater the reproductive potential of males if the predictions of ocean warming for the next
48
49 298 decades were correct [63].

5
6
7 303 Summarizing the aspects of reproductive biology of L. santolla, such as absence of sperm storage organ
8
9
304 coupled with slow sperm- and seminal recovery suggest that L. santolla populations subject to intense male-only
10
305 fisheries may be generally vulnerable to depletion of seminal reserves. Temperature modulates the time necessary to
11
12 306 recover seminal reserves. Seminal recovery is faster in seawater of 9°C than 12°C, indicating that different seminal
13
14 307 replenishment rates in relation to latitude and depth might exist. Especially individuals inhabiting the northern limit
15
16 308 of distribution might be susceptible to seminal depletion, in contrast to those located in southern or deeper habitats.
17
18 309 Considering that the seminal recovery rate is slower in seawater of 12°C, a climate change scenario could
19
20 310 additionally aggravate the risk of seminal depletion in L. santolla in its northern distributional limit.

L. 80-81: Reproductive season varies depending on the region (between north and southern
29 parts of their distribution)?
30
31 We included the following phrases in the introduction for better understanding:
32
33 “Biological information of L. santolla is largely restricted to the southern limit of distribution
34
(Beagle Channel) without data describing reproductive aspects of males derived from their
35
36 northern distributional limit. Intraspecific latitudinal variability in the reproductive pattern
37
38 and traits has been documented in crustacean species. Consequently, L. santolla in its
39
40 northern distributional limit (this study) is exposed to different prevailing environmental
41 conditions (e.g. temperature, photoperiod) which possibly have led to variations in the
42
43 reproductive pattern between the southern and northern limits of its distribution.”.

52 Figure 1a shows a picture of the placement of electrodes during electroejaculation and

L. 275-281: As a result, what method do you think the best to estimate the recovery rate of

18
19 We included that following section in the discussion: “We used the two methods to
20
21 estimate recovery complementary, as they refer to distinct components of the reproductive
22 structures. Dry weight of the vasa deferentia represents the total of sperm and seminal fluids,
23
24 while the standardized sperm area relates solely to the relative sperm amount. We suggest
25
26 that the most appropriate method to be applied in further studies depends on the specific
27
28
research question.”.
29
30
31 L. 306-320: Delete the conclusion section because this section (L. 307-320) is redundant.
32
33 The conclusion section was shorted and now is more concise summarizing only the
34
most important findings of the study. The conclusion section was not deleted completely to
35
36 coincide with the format of the journal Royal Society Open Science.

45 p2: If the authors want to use the plural of sperm I suggest to use the term "sperms".
46
Now, the term “sperm” is used in singular. It was corrected in all relevant phrases.
47
48
49
50 p4: If the authors really meant "physiologically" they have to explain how they have proved
51
52 this. But I guess they meant "physically" in terms of body size. The right term is
53 “physically”.
54
55 Indeed we wanted to refer to “physiologically” mature and included the corresponding
56
57 citation. “Physiologically” mature refers to individuals which are able to develop gonads.

p4: Since the animals are not genetically identical and differ in size and most probably in age
10 it would be more appropriate in most cases to use the standard deviation.
11
12 See also e.g. Altman & Bland 2005 BMJ.
13
14 As suggested by the reviewer, instead of using the standard error, we now state the
15
mean with the standard deviation in the results section and in figure 2.
16
17
18
19 p4: What is the usual water temperature during mating season?
20
21 We indicated the usual water temperature during the mating season and included the
22 following phrase: “The zone of origin of the individuals of this study is located close to its
23
24 northern limit of distribution where crabs reproduce in shallow waters and mean temperatures
25
26 present during mating are 9°C (winter mean) and 12°C (annual mean).”.
27
28
29 p5: How many slices per section were measured for sperm area?
30
31 We added the following phrase to Material and Methods:”One slice of the middle
32
33 section of the vasa deferentia, which corresponds to the section where spermatophore
34
reserves are located, was used to estimate area covered by sperm in the lumen.”.
35
36
37
38 p5: Sperm area should be put in relation to CL and/or diameter of VD.
39
40 As suggested by the reviewer, now we present [(sperm area/CL) *1000] to avoid
41 influence of crab size.
42
43
44
45 p7: Why is group sample size 4 while in the method parts the authors wrote 5 per group?
46
47
Sample sizes are now stated explicitly for each group.
48
49
50 p9: I would say that "brood" has already been fertilized. So better say "eggs".
51
52 We thank the reviewer for this observation. “Brood” was changed to “oocytes”.
53
54
55 p9: What about a seasonal aspect in the VDW increase? The authors collected the animals in
56
57 October and kept them for a month until the experiments started. The mating season normally
58
59 starts in late Nov to early Dec. So maybe there was either some delay in VD filling due to
60 catching or other artifical factors, or the males of the studied population just usually fill their

3 VDs later. I think a crucial information would be what temperature is normally present in the
4
5 water during mating!
6
7 In the Beagle Channel the mating season of L. santolla starts in late November to
8
9
early December and lasts approximately one month. However, biological information of L.
10 santolla is largely restricted to the southern limit of distribution (Beagle Channel) without
11
12 data describing reproductive aspects of males derived from their northern distributional limit.
13
14 Intraspecific latitudinal variability in the reproductive pattern and traits has been documented
15
in crustacean species. Consequently, L. santolla in its northern distributional limit (this study)
16
17 is exposed to different prevailing environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, photoperiod)
18
19 which possibly have led to variations in the reproductive pattern between the southern and
20
21 northern limits of its distribution, and L. santolla in its northern distributional limit possibly
22 has a different window of reproduction. For this reason we did not conclude a seasonal aspect
23
24 of seminal recovery in L. santolla in its northern limit of distribution. As requested we
25
26 included the usual water temperature during the mating season assuming a larger window of
27
28
reproduction of this species but from the northern limit of its distribution and included the
29 following phrase: “The zone of origin of the individuals of this study is located close to its
30
31 northern limit of distribution where crabs reproduce in shallow waters and mean temperatures
32
33 present during mating are 9°C (winter mean) and 12°C (annual mean).”.
34
35
36 p9: Is natural ejaculation in L. santolla an "all or something" action? So, during copulation, is
37
38 the whole mature spermatophore packet transferred leaving the VD completely empty? If
39
40 eggs of several females could be fertilized by one "load" in subsequent copulations what is
41 the disadvantage in this? Or what is the point here?
42
43 In general, we restructured the discussion and where necessary rephrased for more
44
45 clarity. In L. santolla the amount of ejaculate delivered during one mating is unknown.
46
Details about lithodid mating ability are described only in Paralithodes camtschaticus and P.
47
48 brevipes which partially transfer sperm of their reserves during one mating resembling a
49
50 “something” action. Lithodid crabs are polygamous. The crucial point is that, for example, in
51
52 P. brevipes an increase in the mating frequency reduces the sperm number ejaculated, the
53 percentage of spawning females and female fertilization rate. After the second successive
54
55 mating of small males (<100 mm CL) partial or null fertilization occurs in females.
56
57 Consequently, crustaceans with slow seminal recovery in a male-only fishery which have
58
59
mated repeatedly might have depleted seminal reserves especially as the reproductive season
60 progresses.

5 p11: I am not sure if I understood this correctly: Mating season for L. santolla is during
6
7 southern hemispheric summer (starting late Nov to Dec) when water temperature is normally
8
9
slightly increased. What is the normal temperature condition during mating in natural
10 environment (and does mating take place at a certain depth?) for L. santolla? I do not really
11
12 understand why higher water temperature of 12°C does effect seminal filling/maturing
13
14 unfavorable if mating is usually during higher water temperatures (in summer).
15
At least the author's explanation concerning metabolism is not convincing for me.
16
17 Lithodid crabs perform bathymetrical migrations which are associated with
18
19 reproduction, where mating takes place in shallow waters. These reproductive migrations
20
21 have been observed in the Beagle channel but information is fragmented. The zone of origin
22 of the individuals of this study is located close to its northern limit of distribution where crabs
23
24 reproduce in shallow waters and mean temperatures present during mating are 9°C (winter
25
26 mean) and 12°C (annual mean) (see explanation above for likely varying reproductive pattern
27
28
between the southern and northern limit of distribution).
29 L. santolla can be fished at sites between 5°C and 12°C along its range of distribution.
30
31 The higher water temperature of 12°C likely affects recovery seminal reserves unfavorable
32
33 because the origin of the crabs from our study is from its northern distributional limit and
34
12°C may be close to the threshold of temperature tolerance of L. santolla. For example,
35
36 deep-water representatives of the Lithodinae sub-family were excluded from waters
37
38 exceeding temperatures of 13°C.
39
40 We added two reliable references (book section of Willmer et al. 2005 and Paper of
41 Pörtner 2002) to justify that lower temperature implies a reduction of the standard metabolic
42
43 rate (SMR) of the organism and to better explain that therefore more energy may be available
44
45 to be assigned to reproduction (faster seminal recovery at 9°C).
46
47
48 p18: N-numbers should be given in all figure legends.
49
50 We added N-numbers to all figure legends.
51
52
53 p21: To be honest, this figure is not really informative. At least, areas with sperm should be
54
55 marked with a transparent color or in a similar way.
56
57 We modified figure 5 for better visibility of sperm areas. Now, figure 5 now shows an
58
59
overview of a histological cross-section of the vasa deferentia of L. santolla and a detailed
60 view thereof displaying spermatophores filled with sperm.

RSOS 181700.R1: Temperature-dependent seminal recovery in the southern
king crab Lithodes santolla
Katrin Pretterebner, Luis Miguel Pardo, Kurt Paschke
We would like to thank Dr. Jonas Keiler for the revision. We have responded
to all of the comments of the reviewer specifically and made appropriate
modifications to our manuscript.
Here is the point-by-point list of the modifications:
Reviewer: 2
p9 l 227: The addition of the annual mean is confusing here since mating takes
place at 9°C during winter, only. The annual mean does not play a role during
mating, does it?
<U+F0B7> In the Beagle Channel (southern distributional limit) the mating season
of L. santolla starts in late November to early December and lasts
approximately one month. However, biological information of L.
santolla is largely restricted to the southern limit of distribution
without data describing reproductive aspects of males derived from
their northern distributional limit. The exact period of mating of L.
santolla in its northern distributional limit has not been described yet.
Intraspecific latitudinal variability in the reproductive pattern and traits
has been documented in crustacean species. Consequently, L. santolla
in its northern distributional limit (this study) is exposed to different
prevailing environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, photoperiod)
which likely have led to variations in the reproductive pattern between
the southern and northern limits of its distribution, and L. santolla in
its northern distributional limit probably has a different window of
reproduction. For this reason, we assume an extended window of
reproduction in the crab´s northern distributional limit using the mean
sea surface temperature during the austral winter (9°C) and throughout
the year (12°C) as experimental temperatures.
figure page 17: The gonopores are at the coxae!
<U+F0B7> In the legend of figure 1a and in the manuscript the following was
corrected: gonopores (openings at the coxae of the fifth pereiopods).
Additionally, the following remarks in the attached PDF were corrected:
<U+F0B7> As suggested by the reviewer we deleted the hypothesis (“decreased
metabolism increases seminal production by providing more energy
for this process”) and stated the following: “The faster seminal
material recovery rate in seawater of 9°C than 12°C after 30 days may
be explained by the close proximity of the crabs in this study to their
northern distributional limit. Hall and Thatje [44] concluded that deep-
water representatives of the Lithodinae sub-family were excluded from
waters exceeding temperatures of 13°C. The experimental temperature
of 12°C may be close to their threshold of temperature tolerance and
therefore, crabs may be energetically less efficient.”.
<U+F0B7> According to the suggestion we corrected the following sentence:
“Seminal reserves of L. santolla were not fully recovered within 30
days after electroejaculation at none of the experimental temperatures
(figure 4).”. New corrected sentence: “Within 30 days after
electroejaculation, seminal reserves of L. santolla were not fully
recovered at any of the experimental temperatures (figure 4).”.
Although the authors have provided the full names for Paralithodes,
Callinectes, etc. already in the introduction I would suggest to give the full
name if it is mentioned first in the discussion.
<U+F0B7> We added the full names of all species mentioned first in the
discussion, even if they were already stated in the introduction.
Usage of upper and lower case should be consistent in references.
<U+F0B7> We corrected the usage of upper and lower case in the references,
which now is consistent.
<U+F0B7> As requested, “N” was changed into “n” in all figure legends.
<U+F0B7> As requested, exact sample sizes of each sample group was stated in
the figure legends and main manuscript.
<U+F0B7> We added the following sentence to relate our findings to sustainable
fishery:”While our results represent a first step towards improving
knowledge on male reproductive traits, we highlight the importance of
further research on aspects of reproduction of L. santolla in its
northern distributional limit to allow a sustainable crustacean fishery
in the future.”.
<U+F0B7> We corrected small grammatical mistakes and word order as suggested
in the PDF, whereby these corrections are not listed here.
