This is a well-written and interesting manuscript that contributes to our knowledge of how
functional traits link to locomotor and dietary ecologies. I particularly enjoyed the introduction
that points out the utility of these types of analyses and the wealth of data waiting to be accessed
in natural history collections.
The analyses are appropriate and conclusions are scientifically sound; I mainly have minor
comments in addition to one or two major points. Overall, this is a very good paper and I thank
the authors for making their compilation of the rodent data and code available online to other
researchers.
Major comments
First, although your sample is quite large, it is not quite ‘global’ in terms of geography and, likely,
phylogeny (I fear you may be sampling only a few number of clades). The rodents in your sample
are from Australia and its neighboring islands, the Baltic region, and Mesoamerica – this
probably only includes a tiny bit of the overall rodent tree (> 2,000 spp.). It would be help to
provide some indication of how broadly sampled the rodent family tree is (e.g., include sentences
like “we sampled X/X rodent families, X%”). Or, preferably in addition to this, plot a phylogeny
and indicate across it (with stars or another symbol) where the families you sampled fall along
the tree. I don’t think this is any fatal flaw or detracts from your conclusions, but this issue should
be discussed nonetheless (it is hinted to in the Conclusions).
Second, although it seems to be that phylogenetic signal in these traits are low, it would be
helpful to provide some measure of this with Pagel’s lambda or Blomberg’s K. In addition,
perhaps you could also include a two-panel figure of the diet and locomotor categories
distributed across the phylogeny of your 208 spp. This can be done with the contmap function in
phytools. This would provide some visualization of how conserved these ecologies (vs the traits)
are across the tree.
Third, an alternative way of coding dietary data (instead of using categories) would be to
ordinate the ‘MammalDIET’ dietary matrix of Kissling et al. (2014 Ecology and Evolution) using
Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) with Gower distance. This dietary matrix spans all extant
mammals and ranks a variety of food items (e.g., seeds, fruit, roots) on a 0-3 scale based on the
item’s importance in a species’ diet. You could simply regress the individual craniodental
functional traits against the PCoA scores to explore which are highly correlated. This is just a
suggestion and by no means a requirement – feel free to leave out.
Minor comments
pg 1, line 57: ‘is’ should be ‘are’ so that this sentence reads “…substrate use are commonly…”
pg 2, line 30: ‘it’ is missing from this sentence “…of these regards, so [it] is not a matter…”
pg 2, line 40: ‘downstream analyses’ is awkward, perhaps swap this out for another word/phrase
pg 2, lines 47-49: this sentence mentions the various locomotor and dietary ecologies of rodents
but then only lists the former. Add in a list of your dietary ecologies to this sentence.
pg 3, line 36: delete the comma in “…morphology and ecology, in a quantitative…”
pg 3, line 39: change ‘and’ to ‘while’ so this sentence reads “…strategies, while taking
phylogenetic…”
3
pg 4, line 23: spell out W, HB, T, E, etc and all other abbreviations the first time they are used in
the text of the manuscript even though they are given in tables
pg 4, line 24: data recorded from specimen labels? Do specimen labels usually have these data on
them?
pg 5, line 33: change ‘arises’ to ‘arise’
pg 12, line 52: The rodents in your sample are from Australia and its neighboring islands, the
Baltic region, and Mesoamerica – isn’t this only three biogeographic realms (not four)?
Figures and tables
Figure 1: The caption for Figure 1 should reference Tables 2 and 3 since this is where a reader can
find the definitions of these characters.
Figure 2 and 3: Italicize genus names for the shape outlines on the x-axis (DF1)
Table 3: I find the examples for each of your trait categories in Tables 2 and 3 to be very helpful.
Why did you leave them out for Generalized Herbivore and Specialized Herbivore? Please
include examples if you can.

I have reviewed the manuscript entitled “Morphology captures diet and locomotor types in
rodents”. This paper is about the relationship of whole body morphology (body shape, cranial
and dental shape) with diet and locomotory mode using a comparative macroevolutionary
approach in rodents. The authors find substantial homoplasy, where unrelated species with
similar diets or locomotion types are characterised by similar morphology.
4
The authors whole-body approach is commendable given the wealth of literature on only specific
body regions, and how important it is for our understanding of what influences morphological
evolution – however see below the potential issues of size correction. The sampling is also worth
praising since it works out to be about 10 specimens per species (208 species), which is great
within-species sampling for this kind of study, and 208 species is certainly a huge amount of
work. However, the authors note that there are 2200 species of rodent (page 2), and so it would be
useful for the reader if a sentence was added to the methods indicating how these 208 spp.
sampled represent the 2200 spp. diversity.
I very much enjoyed the first paragraph of the discussion – this is exactly what the paper is all
about! Rodent body plan is conserved and highly recognizable. Yet, there is rampant homoplasy
and convergent evolution in regards to locomotion and diet impacting morphology. This isn’t
played up enough! I suggest one additional figure: I and other readers would surely be interested
to see the rodent morphospace as described by these data, presented using the
phylomorphospace approach, where a phylogenetic tree is projected into a PCA biplot, so that
one can see very easily the rampant homoplasy. The criss-crossing branches indicating shared
morphology in unrelated taxa is the most visual way of presenting this result.
Size correction: This is an often misused method in macroevolutionary studies. The authors chose
to use residuals from a regression to deal with size variation in their data, which removes size
and also allometric variation from the dataset, and leaves “non-allometric shape” information. A
size-only correction alternative (keeping allometric variation) would be the log-shape ratio
approach of Mosimann (1970 & 1979 key papers), which is easily implemented in R using the
geometric mean of the data (see Claude 2013 Hystrix). These two are very different attitudes to
size and shape in morphological evolution (See Klingenberg 2016 Dev Genes Evol). The MS as it
stands ignores body size and focusses only on non-allometric morphological variation in relation
to ecology. This is arguably fine, but limited. Body size and ecology is bound to be hugely
correlated, since what size you are will influence what niches you can occupy. I suggest adding in
analyses of HB alone (which was measured but not included) in regards to phylogenetic signal,
diet and locomotion, since this is an important aspect of an animals’ morphology which is
overlooked here. Then contrast those patterns with non-allometric variation and ecology to show
how much diversity and homoplasy there is that has evolved other than by simple allometric
scaling during speciation.
Before examining the morphological changes associated with differences in diet/locomotor mode
using a discriminant analysis approach, I would have expected the authors to show with a
phylogenetic least squares analysis that these factors indeed correlate with morphology, and how
much of the morphological variation they each explain (I suspect a lot). Especially since the
authors state on line 50, page 10 that they are interested in the functional links between
morphology and ecology, and the ecological relevance of these traits. With a multivariate dataset
and treating the shape traits as a single matrix (shape being a multivariate trait), the PGLS can be
done using the ‘procD.pgls’ function of geomorph R package, or the ‘compare.models’ function
of phylocurve R package (see Adams 2014 Evolution; Goolsby 2016 Sys Biol). A trait by trait
PGLS could also be done, but since these traits are likely to be correlated, this approach would
not provide a full understanding of how morphology and ecology are evolutionarily correlated.
Note that this MANOVA test is the statistical analysis normally permed alongside a canonical
variates analysis, which is related to the DFA performed here.
As a final point, I simply want to flag the awkward wording throughout the manuscript (MS)
regarding “data”. The first line of the summary is the first of several instances where the paper
seems to be focusing on data and data analysis, rather than what the data are and the analyses are
actually being used for. E.g. “To understand the functional meaning of morphology, we need to
link morphological and ecological datasets”. Again in the first line of the background “Linking
morphological and ecological datasets is not trivial”. In fact, “link” is used 8 times in the MS. I
would argue that macroevolutionary research isn’t about linking datasets, (what does that
mean?), the strategy we are taking in these macroevolutionary studies is about testing statistical
5
correlations between morphological and ecological data, from which we can infer, but not imply,
causation (adaptation). And also in the discussion, the very first section is a focus on character
choice for the study, rather than what the results mean and the bigger picture. With this critique
in mind I encourage the authors to reconsider the goal of the study and focus on what the
analyses mean for the biology, rather than the analyses and datasets themselves.
Minor comments
Throughout – superfluous capitalization. Statistical procedures such as “discriminant analysis”
and “principal components analysis”, measurements (e.g. “Angle of the Condylar Process”), and
diet strategies (page 11, line 9) do not need to be capitalized.
Page 1, line 29 – “relatedness relate” awkward; suggest “are associated with”
Page 1 – What does this sentence mean? “We conclude that when ecological characters do not
show strong phylogenetic patterns, we cannot predict ecological similarity adequately using only
phylogenies”.
Page 3 – The Background contains many small paragraphs of connected subject matter. Suggest
combining the 2nd and 3rd last since they are both discussing previous work on rodent
ecomorphology
Page 4, line 22 – refer to table 1; also suggest spelling out measurement abbreviations in the
brackets.
Page 4, line 25 – “digital calipers”; should be plural
Page 4, heading b – Title not strictly accurate: you are introducing the phylogenetic hypothesis, or
phylogenetic tree, you used. You are not introducing the data that was used to make the
phylogenetic trees.
Page 5, heading d – Better to cite the R packages and the statistical analyses you did in the
relevant sections of the methods, where you state why you did the analysis.
Page 5, line 21 – It isn’t strictly necessary to cite a package for data table manipulation, only
statistical analysis.
Page 5, line 36 – The authors state that two variables were not included because they were too
“correlated with body mass”. What was the cut off? And what happens if these are simply left in
the analyses? I don’t think that being strongly correlated with body mass means uninformative,
since certainly body mass will influence what ecology an animal lives in.
The ACP is an angle, and the rest of the measurements are linear, which means these data are not
strictly equivalent. Furthermore, was the ACP normally distributed to allow for PGLS size
correction via the residuals approach? Do the authors expect an angle to vary with size? I suggest
that this metric is reexamined separately to the linear measurements.
Page 5, line 52 – “retaining” is not the correct word, since it suggests that PCA removes the
between or within-group variation, which it does not; suggest “examining”
Page 6, heading b – This is probably info that can be in the methods rather than results.
Figure 1 caption – add “refer to Table 1 for measurement details”.
Figure 2 & 3 captions – What is meant by “species treated as unknown”? I couldn’t see discussion
of this in the text.
Figure 3 – The number of different locomotor strategies here means there are many more axes
separating the groups than are presented (unlike the diet, which is would have only one more
axis in addition to those two presented). I suggest adding another biplot (in sup materials if
there’s restricted space, else as a composite figure) with at least 2 more DF axes (DF3v4).

Comments to the Author:
I have received reviews from two experts who have provided some thoughtful and constructive
commentary on your work. As you will see, the reviewers are mostly positive about the research
question and approach, and they recommend that the paper should be considered for publication
in RSOS following suitable revision to address specific points. However, both reviewers raise
points that likely require further data analysis to address, along with associated text revisions. In
particular, both reviewers request that the authors quantify the phylogenetic signal in the data
and provide additional analysis and figures to support the main conclusions of the work.
Reviewer 2 suggests that body size has not been adequately addressed with the current statistical
approach, and suggests the addition of a separate analysis to address body size. Both reviewers
request that the authors put their sampling of rodent species into context of the overall diversity
and global distribution of rodents. Finally, Reviewer 2 suggests that the authors could better
communicate the biological relevance of the findings by revising the text to focus less on the
‘dataset’ and more on the broader ecological and evolutionary questions that the dataset have
allowed the authors to address. If the authors feel that they are able to address these points, I
would be happy to consider a resubmitted version of the manuscript.

Comments to the Author:
I have received reviews from two experts who have provided some thoughtful and constructive
commentary on your work. As you will see, the reviewers are mostly positive about the research
question and approach, and they recommend that the paper should be considered for publication in
label_version_3
RSOS following suitable revision to address specific points. However, both reviewers raise points that
likely require further data analysis to address, along with associated text revisions. In particular, both
reviewers request that the authors quantify the phylogenetic signal in the data and provide additional
analysis and figures to support the main conclusions of the work. Reviewer 2 suggests that body size
has not been adequately addressed with the current statistical approach, and suggests the addition of
a separate analysis to address body size. Both reviewers request that the authors put their sampling
of rodent species into context of the overall diversity and global distribution of rodents. Finally,
Reviewer 2 suggests that the authors could better communicate the biological relevance of the
findings by revising the text to focus less on the ‘dataset’ and more on the broader ecological and
evolutionary questions that the dataset have allowed the authors to address. If the authors feel that
they are able to address these points, I would be happy to consider a resubmitted version of the
manuscript.
We appreciate the opportunity to submit a new version of the manuscript. We have addressed the
major issues brought up by all three reviewers, and consider that their input significantly improved
our manuscript. The major issues were: potential problems with size correction, measurement of
phylogenetic signal, the phylogenetic context of our sample, the wording of our eco-evolutionary
interpretations, and the affine nature of the morphospace produced by discriminant analyses.
Our responses to the reviewer suggestions follow below (marked with “R >” and highlighted with a
different color for easier reading).

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a well-written and interesting manuscript that contributes to our knowledge of how functional
traits link to locomotor and dietary ecologies. I particularly enjoyed the introduction that points out
the utility of these types of analyses and the wealth of data waiting to be accessed in natural history
collections.
The analyses are appropriate and conclusions are scientifically sound; I mainly have minor comments
in addition to one or two major points. Overall, this is a very good paper and I thank the authors for
making their compilation of the rodent data and code available online to other researchers.
Major comments
First, although your sample is quite large, it is not quite ‘global’ in terms of geography and, likely,
phylogeny (I fear you may be sampling only a few number of clades). The rodents in your sample are
from Australia and its neighboring islands, the Baltic region, and Mesoamerica – this probably only
includes a tiny bit of the overall rodent tree (> 2,000 spp.). It would be help to provide some
indication of how broadly sampled the rodent family tree is (e.g., include sentences like “we sampled
X/X rodent families, X%”). Or, preferably in addition to this, plot a phylogeny and indicate across it
any fatal flaw or detracts from your conclusions, but this issue should be discussed nonetheless (it is
hinted to in the Conclusions).
R > We have examined the whole text and made sure that we did not imply that our sample is global.
The biogeographic representation is also better explained in the new manuscript (introduction and
subsection (a) of the methods section). Additionally, we added a figure of the rodent phylogeny
highlighting the species included in the sample and the families that they belong to (Fig 2) as well as a
supplementary table with the number of species examined for each family (Table S1). Our sampling
covers a good part of the phylogenetic diversity of the Rodentia, although species sampling is clearly
more extensive in certain families.
Second, although it seems to be that phylogenetic signal in these traits are low, it would be helpful to
provide some measure of this with Pagel’s lambda or Blomberg’s K. In addition, perhaps you could
also include a two-panel figure of the diet and locomotor categories distributed across the phylogeny
of your 208 spp. This can be done with the contmap function in phytools. This would provide some
visualization of how conserved these ecologies (vs the traits) are across the tree.
R > We now calculate and report the appropriate metrics of phylogenetic signal for body size,
morphology, and ecological categories (methods subsection (h) and Table 4). We also added a figure
(Fig S1) showing the distribution of ecological habits (diet types and locomotor modes) across the
phylogeny.
Third, an alternative way of coding dietary data (instead of using categories) would be to ordinate the
‘MammalDIET’ dietary matrix of Kissling et al. (2014 Ecology and Evolution) using Principal
Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) with Gower distance. This dietary matrix spans all extant mammals and
ranks a variety of food items (e.g., seeds, fruit, roots) on a 0-3 scale based on the item’s importance in
a species’ diet. You could simply regress the individual craniodental functional traits against the PCoA
scores to explore which are highly correlated. This is just a suggestion and by no means a requirement
– feel free to leave out.
R > In the process of constructing the diet database, we matched the diet columns from the
MammalDIET database with our list of species and in some cases derived our dietary classification
from this source. While the suggested regression would be informative, the level of genus-level
extrapolation in this data source was very high (diet data for 60% of the species in our sample was
extrapolated from a congener), and the data gaps non-random. Under such uncertainty, we prefer to
use our diet categories and assign classes using primary data.
Minor comments
pg 1, line 57: ‘is’ should be ‘are’ so that this sentence reads “…substrate use are commonly…”
R > We reworded sentence to emphasize that we refer to variation, keeping the singular form ‘is’.
pg 2, line 30: ‘it’ is missing from this sentence “…of these regards, so [it] is not a matter…”
R > We adopted this suggestion.
pg 2, line 40: ‘downstream analyses’ is awkward, perhaps swap this out for another word/phrase
with “to address other ecological questions” and adding some examples.
pg 2, lines 47-49: this sentence mentions the various locomotor and dietary ecologies of rodents but
then only lists the former. Add in a list of your dietary ecologies to this sentence.
R > We agree with this suggestion and have added examples of feeding types.
pg 3, line 36: delete the comma in “…morphology and ecology, in a quantitative…”
R > We have adopted this suggestion.
pg 3, line 39: change ‘and’ to ‘while’ so this sentence reads “…strategies, while taking phylogenetic…”
R > We rewrote the sentence accordingly.
pg 4, line 23: spell out W, HB, T, E, etc and all other abbreviations the first time they are used in the
text of the manuscript even though they are given in tables
R > We agree with this suggestion and have expanded all the abbreviations in the paragraph.
pg 4, line 24: data recorded from specimen labels? Do specimen labels usually have these data on
them?
R > Specimen labels indeed often contain this information, although in some cases the head and body
length is not recorded, with total length reported instead.
pg 5, line 33: change ‘arises’ to ‘arise’
R > We reworded the sentence, replacing arise with occur.
pg 12, line 52: The rodents in your sample are from Australia and its neighboring islands, the Baltic
region, and Mesoamerica – isn’t this only three biogeographic realms (not four)?
R > Our sample includes several Nesomyne rodents from Madagascar and some Eastern African birch
mice. We amended subsection (a) of the methods to mention this fourth biogeographic realm.
Figures and tables
Figure 1: The caption for Figure 1 should reference Tables 2 and 3 since this is where a reader can find
the definitions of these characters.
R > The caption now points readers to Table 1, where each measurement is described in detail.
Figure 2 and 3: Italicize genus names for the shape outlines on the x-axis (DF1)
R > The new morphospace figure does not have shape outlines because we now plotted an nMDS
space with different loadings that do not necessarily correspond to those of the flexible discriminant
analysis. We preferred to keep the focus on the ecologically-relevant FDA results.
Table 3: I find the examples for each of your trait categories in Tables 2 and 3 to be very helpful. Why
if you can.
R > We are thankful for this suggestion, and we added examples for the herbivorous categories.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
I have reviewed the manuscript entitled “Morphology captures diet and locomotor types in rodents”.
This paper is about the relationship of whole body morphology (body shape, cranial and dental shape)
with diet and locomotory mode using a comparative macroevolutionary approach in rodents. The
authors find substantial homoplasy, where unrelated species with similar diets or locomotion types
are characterised by similar morphology.
The authors whole-body approach is commendable given the wealth of literature on only specific
body regions, and how important it is for our understanding of what influences morphological
evolution – however see below the potential issues of size correction. The sampling is also worth
praising since it works out to be about 10 specimens per species (208 species), which is great within-
species sampling for this kind of study, and 208 species is certainly a huge amount of work. However,
the authors note that there are 2200 species of rodent (page 2), and so it would be useful for the
reader if a sentence was added to the methods indicating how these 208 spp. sampled represent the
2200 spp. diversity.
R > The sample has been put in context, with a new figure (figure 2) and supplementary table (table
S1), as well as edits to the text to explain our representation of rodent diversity and how we think that
we broadly covered the phylogenetic diversity of rodents although species-level sampling might be
somewhat biased.
I very much enjoyed the first paragraph of the discussion – this is exactly what the paper is all about!
Rodent body plan is conserved and highly recognizable. Yet, there is rampant homoplasy and
convergent evolution in regards to locomotion and diet impacting morphology. This isn’t played up
enough! I suggest one additional figure: I and other readers would surely be interested to see the
rodent morphospace as described by these data, presented using the phylomorphospace approach,
where a phylogenetic tree is projected into a PCA biplot, so that one can see very easily the rampant
homoplasy. The criss-crossing branches indicating shared morphology in unrelated taxa is the most
visual way of presenting this result.
R > We agree that phylomorphospace or traitgram approaches are probably the best ways to visualize
homoplasy and convergence. However, with the number of species (plus nodes and branches) in our
sample the amount of visual clutter obscured any interpretable patterns despite our attempts to
‘declutter’ the figure with custom plotting parameters. We reworded several paragraphs of the
discussion to put more emphasis on the widespread convergence despite the conserved rodent body
plan.
Size correction: This is an often misused method in macroevolutionary studies. The authors chose to
use residuals from a regression to deal with size variation in their data, which removes size and also
allometric variation from the dataset, and leaves “non-allometric shape” information. A size-only
correction alternative (keeping allometric variation) would be the log-shape ratio approach of
Mosimann (1970 & 1979 key papers), which is easily implemented in R using the geometric mean of
morphological evolution (See Klingenberg 2016 Dev Genes Evol). The MS as it stands ignores body
size and focusses only on non-allometric morphological variation in relation to ecology. This is
arguably fine, but limited. Body size and ecology is bound to be hugely correlated, since what size you
are will influence what niches you can occupy. I suggest adding in analyses of HB alone (which was
measured but not included) in regards to phylogenetic signal, diet and locomotion, since this is an
important aspect of an animals’ morphology which is overlooked here. Then contrast those patterns
with non-allometric variation and ecology to show how much diversity and homoplasy there is that
has evolved other than by simple allometric scaling during speciation.
R> We appreciate the suggestion of testing body size in regards to phylogenetic signal, diet and
locomotion. We added these additional analyses, and testing for differences in body size (body mass
and condylobasal length, excluding head-body length because in some specimens HB was calculated
indirectly from total length and tail length) among species with different ecologies was extremely
helpful in minimizing the risk of overlooking the known macroecological relationships between body
size and ecological habits. Within our sample, diet types and locomotion modes are not exclusive to
particular sizes, so we proceed with our residuals approach, keeping in mind that there is no ideal or
unbiased solution for size correction.
Before examining the morphological changes associated with differences in diet/locomotor mode
using a discriminant analysis approach, I would have expected the authors to show with a
phylogenetic least squares analysis that these factors indeed correlate with morphology, and how
much of the morphological variation they each explain (I suspect a lot). Especially since the authors
state on line 50, page 10 that they are interested in the functional links between morphology and
ecology, and the ecological relevance of these traits. With a multivariate dataset and treating the
shape traits as a single matrix (shape being a multivariate trait), the PGLS can be done using the
‘procD.pgls’ function of geomorph R package, or the ‘compare.models’ function of phylocurve R
package (see Adams 2014 Evolution; Goolsby 2016 Sys Biol). A trait by trait PGLS could also be done,
but since these traits are likely to be correlated, this approach would not provide a full understanding
of how morphology and ecology are evolutionarily correlated. Note that this MANOVA test is the
statistical analysis normally permed alongside a canonical variates analysis, which is related to the
DFA performed here.
R > We appreciate this suggestion and now include a MANOVA (using Procrustes distance PGLS) that
supported our findings, and a short caution of how CVAs are very useful, but they are also prone to
finding groups where there aren’t any. The corresponding section now reads as follows:
“Before using discriminant analyses to examine the morphological changes associated with
differences in diet and locomotion, we used phylogenetic multivariate analyses of variance across the
set of trees (phylogenetic MANOVAs) to first test whether or not we had significantly different
ecological groups. To fit the models, we used a Procrustes distance PGLS (procD.pgls function in the
geomorph package) on the size-corrected data. This test is designed to take a matrix of morphological
variables as a response while including the phylogeny in the error term.”
As a final point, I simply want to flag the awkward wording throughout the manuscript (MS) regarding
“data”. The first line of the summary is the first of several instances where the paper seems to be
focusing on data and data analysis, rather than what the data are and the analyses are actually being
used for. E.g. “To understand the functional meaning of morphology, we need to link morphological
and ecological datasets”. Again in the first line of the background “Linking morphological and
ecological datasets is not trivial”. In fact, “link” is used 8 times in the MS. I would argue that
taking in these macroevolutionary studies is about testing statistical correlations between
morphological and ecological data, from which we can infer, but not imply, causation (adaptation).
And also in the discussion, the very first section is a focus on character choice for the study, rather
than what the results mean and the bigger picture. With this critique in mind I encourage the authors
to reconsider the goal of the study and focus on what the analyses mean for the biology, rather than
the analyses and datasets themselves.
R > Considering these comments, we have changed the wording in 7 of the 8 instances in which ‘link’
was previously used, and all instances of ‘dataset’ are strictly methods-related in this new manuscript.
We made changes to the abstract, introduction, and discussion to focus more on the biology and less
on the data analysis. We kept the paragraph discussing character choices, but it is now within a wider
discussion of the ecological meaning of morphological features (we renamed the subsection as well).
Minor comments
Throughout – superfluous capitalization. Statistical procedures such as “discriminant analysis” and
“principal components analysis”, measurements (e.g. “Angle of the Condylar Process”), and diet
strategies (page 11, line 9) do not need to be capitalized.
R > We removed all (13) instances of superfluous capitalization.
Page 1, line 29 – “relatedness relate” awkward; suggest “are associated with”
R > We thank the reviewer pointing this out and have adopted this suggestion.
Page 1 – What does this sentence mean? “We conclude that when ecological characters do not show
strong phylogenetic patterns, we cannot predict ecological similarity adequately using only
phylogenies”.
R> We reworded this sentence to: “…when ecological characters do not show strong phylogenetic
patterns, we cannot simply assume that close relatives are ecologically similar”.
Page 3 – The Background contains many small paragraphs of connected subject matter. Suggest
combining the 2nd and 3rd last since they are both discussing previous work on rodent
ecomorphology
R > We adopted this suggestion.
Page 4, line 22 – refer to table 1; also suggest spelling out measurement abbreviations in the
brackets.
R > We adopted this suggestion, making sure that there are no unexplained abbreviations throughout
the text.
Page 4, line 25 – “digital calipers”; should be plural
R> Done
phylogenetic tree, you used. You are not introducing the data that was used to make the phylogenetic
trees.
R > We thank the reviewer for spotting this inconsistency. We replaced “phylogenetic data” with
“phylogenetic trees”.
Page 5, heading d – Better to cite the R packages and the statistical analyses you did in the relevant
sections of the methods, where you state why you did the analysis.
R > We have adopted this suggestion.
Page 5, line 21 – It isn’t strictly necessary to cite a package for data table manipulation, only statistical
analysis.
R > It may not be customary to cite packages for table manipulation, but we argue that at least in the
case of dplyr, such packages are extremely helpful and a prerequisite for many statistical analyses. All
the scripts we’ve made available depend on the speed and clarity in the data processing and
manipulation workflows made possible by this particular package, so we believe that this reference
could be helpful for many readers/researchers who may want to replicate our tests or do similar
analyses.
Page 5, line 36 – The authors state that two variables were not included because they were too
“correlated with body mass”. What was the cut off? And what happens if these are simply left in the
analyses? I don’t think that being strongly correlated with body mass means uninformative, since
certainly body mass will influence what ecology an animal lives in.
R > We removed this line to avoid confusion. These two measurements were collected as candidate
proxies for body size; they were not among the purported ecologically-relevant traits, but we now
describe how these were incorporated into the size correction process and in the tests for differences
in body size among species with different diets and locomotion modes. The corresponding parts now
read as follows:
Methods subsection (e) – first paragraph:
“Out of three highly correlated (non-central correlations > 0.95) candidate proxies of body size (body
mass, condylobasal length and head-body length), we selected body mass as a measure of overall
body dimension because we considered it a suitable whole-body descriptor that has known
relationships with species’ ecology.”
The ACP is an angle, and the rest of the measurements are linear, which means these data are not
strictly equivalent. Furthermore, was the ACP normally distributed to allow for PGLS size correction
via the residuals approach? Do the authors expect an angle to vary with size? I suggest that this
metric is reexamined separately to the linear measurements.
R > ACP values were normally distributed, and we did not expect the angle to vary with size so ACP
values were only log transformed without any size correction. This was only made clear in the R
scripts but not in the main text. We have amended this issue in the Size Correction subsections and
with the changes in our ordination approach.
Page 5, line 52 – “retaining” is not the correct word, since it suggests that PCA removes the between
or within-group variation, which it does not; suggest “examining”
R > We have adopted this suggestion and replaced “retaining” with “examining”.
Page 6, heading b – This is probably info that can be in the methods rather than results.
R > Because this subsection has been expanded with the results for further tests of phylogenetic
signal, we kept this information (itself a result of testing for phylogenetic signal) here.
Figure 1 caption – add “refer to Table 1 for measurement details”.
R > Done
Figure 2 & 3 captions – What is meant by “species treated as unknown”? I couldn’t see discussion of
this in the text.
R > We now mention the workflow for species for which we could not assign ecological categories
confidently using primary data (Methods subsection (c)). The corresponding part now reads as
follows:
“Species for which we could not confidently assign ecological categories were classified as unknown
(U), and their diet and locomotion were predicted using morphology using the predictive framework
that is built into discriminant analyses.”
Figure 3 – The number of different locomotor strategies here means there are many more axes
separating the groups than are presented (unlike the diet, which is would have only one more axis in
addition to those two presented). I suggest adding another biplot (in sup materials if there’s restricted
space, else as a composite figure) with at least 2 more DF axes (DF3v4).
R > We now visualize the morphospace using nonmetric MDS axes, in which our chosen
implementation collapsed the high-dimensional morphological data into a Euclidean 2d space
iteratively. If required, we may still include biplots for the first four discriminant functions from the
FDAs in the Appendix.
Reviewer 3
This study uses a small collection of linear morphometric measurements, i.e., lengths and depths, plus
one angular measurement to examine the relationship between morphology and both locomotory
and dietary ecology. Aside from the use of a phylogenetically-informed discriminant analysis, the
methods (and data) are traditional in the sense that they were widely used through the 1990's, if not
now. One reason why they are not widely used is that this approach to measurement results in
variables that are highly correlated with size, and size is correlated with diet. Removing the effect of
size removes important information about adaptations to functionally challenging diets, and the
method used to remove the effect of size presumes that a single-slope regression model fits the data.
However, allometric relationships to both overall size and among the measurements may depend on
diet if only because species that eat small seeds do not need a large gape, but small-bodied species
that eat large foods for their size do, and some of those also eat mechanically challenging foods, so
the trade-off between bite-forces and gape will be most consequential for them.
R> Following the suggestions of Reviewer #2, we have addressed the issues related to size correction
brought up here (see above). We recognize the importance of the fine-scale associations between
food size, gape, bite mechanics, and body size, but were severely limited by the availability of data on
diet preferences.
particularly informative about morphology because they omit most of the information about bite-
forces at incisors and molars.
Another general problem with the study design is that diverse dietary specializations are lumped
within a single class. The classification scheme for diets is, no doubt, useful for analyzes of food webs
but it is only incidentally relevant to biomechanics. A main result of this study is the distinctness of
specialized herbivores but they are mainly arvicolines, so it is not surprising that the the angle of the
condylar process, has exceptional discriminatory power for distinguishing "specialized herbivores."
Arvicolines have an exceptionally odd orientation of their mandibular tooth rows relative to their
mandibular processes. Other specialized herbivores do not resemble them but they were not
classified as specialized herbivores (e.g., specialized grazers that have adaptations to resist torque,
and hard-nut specialists that have adaptations to generate powerful forces at their incisors).
Insectivores are also classified as that, without distinguishing species that specialize on colonial
insects ("ant-eaters", for example), that tend to have adaptations for their elongated tongues,
including slender mandibles, elongated rostra and, in many cases, elongated condylar processes and
those that eat larger, softer insects, including butterflies.
R> We agree that our classification of diet types may lump separate specialized preferences into
single categories. Less than 9% of our 208 species had reliable and detailed information on preferred
food types, so we chose a broad but coherent categorization scheme that would at least reflect the
accessibility and digestibility of different food sources. The issues with arvicolines are addressed
below.
I am struck by the lack of disparity shown in Figure 2 but that might be an artifact of the method (or
the data). It would be useful to see a morphospace that is interpretable as such, i.e., the distances
between the points indicate the morphological distinctness of the species. If that too shows very little
disparity, that would suggest that the measurements fail to capture what differs among these species.
That space, however, would not be Euclidean and therefore the distances between the points could
be misleading. The space is non-Euclidean because the data contain an angle as well as the linear
measurements, and those classes of measurements are incommensurate. A non-metric approach
might therefore be better than the one taken in this analysis. A (non-metric) phylomorphospace
would make it easier to determine if the data understate the disparity of these species or if it is the
lumping of ecologically disparate species within diet-classes that makes them look so uniform in
Figure 2.
R > We now complement the supervised discriminant function analyses with a nonmetric
multidimensional scaling approach. We added a morphospace subsection to the methods and results,
replaced figured 3 and 4 (now figure 3), and edited the discussion to reflect the nMDS approach. This
ordination now shows a much more reasonable level of disparity, which helps us rule out the
possibility that our chosen measurements failed to capture interspecific differences.
One of the main conclusions of this study is that the measurements used in it provide a powerful set
of characters for ecomorphological analysis. However, I question how effectively they could
discriminate among diet classes were arvicolines omitted from the analysis or were other specialized
herbivores classified as such.
R > Excluding arvicolines from the FDA still led to good classification of Specialized Herbivores (under
our definition), but this may be because of the overall distinctiveness of the remaining SH species
(beaver, gophers, porcupine). In this case, better sampling would probably be very helpful to resolve
this question. Also, specialized herbivores were only one of eleven ecological categories for which we
discriminant function approach, we stand by our conclusion that our set of measurements provides a
good set of accessible characters for large-scale, multispecies ecomorphological analyses. This
distinction is now made explicit in subsection (b) of the discussion.
The results also do not support the conclusion of widespread convergent evolution and parallelism in
rodent feeding; because neither the hypothesis of convergence nor that of parallelism was tested.
R > We edited the text to avoid overstating our results and using them as direct evidence for
convergent evolution. Subsection (c) of the discussion now mentions that our data can be examined
using existing methods that can identify cases of convergent evolution (for example: using the
SURFACE method of Ingram & Mahler (2013)) and also measure its strength (with the Wheatsheaf
index of Arbuckle et al. (2014)). Given the extensive exploratory analyses and simulations needed to
use and interpret Ornstein Uhlenbeck models of trait evolution properly when testing convergence,
we consider that such tests are best left for a separate paper.
