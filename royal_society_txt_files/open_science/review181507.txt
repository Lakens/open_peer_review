In this work the authors present their results on the adsorption of adsorbable organic halogens
(AOX) by activated carbon. They analyzed the degradation and volatilization of AOX to eliminate
the effect on adsorption. The effect of reaction parameters on adsorption was studied. GC-MS and
FTIR have been used to study the differences in bleaching effluent and activated carbon. Based on
comparison of with or without activated carbon adsorption they could conclude that
chlorobenzene and chlorophenol in AOX are adsorbed and their content is greatly reduced.
Researches are mainly focusing on reducing sources of AOX instead of monitoring and managing
AOX in the environment. This domain is of great importance since chlorinated products are
considered as an important source of pollutants.
1) 2.2. Chlorine dioxide bleaching. 10 g of unbleached dry pulp or lignin was mixed with pure
water in a sealed polyethylene bag. Readers wonder why there is lignin.
2) In the introduction, readers want to know about the research progress of AOX removal. Some
research of activated carbon for organic adsorption.
3) 2.6. Chemical composition analysis of bleaching effluent. GC-MS detection should be divided
into two parts. The first part is the chemical composition analysis of bleaching effluent after
degradation or volatilization. The second part is the chemical composition analysis of bleaching
effluent with or without activated carbon adsorption.
4) Chlorobenzene and chlorophenol are adsorbed by activated carbon. What is its adsorption
mechanism, physical adsorption or chemical adsorption<U+FF1F>
In conclusion, I believe the manuscript requires a minor revision to be considered for publication
in Royal Society Open Science.

The authors report a study on the adsorption of organic chlorides (AOX) in bleaching effluent by
activated carbon. The effect of activated carbon particle size, adsorption pH, adsorption
temperature, adsorbent dosage, adsorption time on AOX adsorption was researched. Also,
volatilization and degradation of AOX were studied for the elimination of their effects on AOX
adsorption. Overall, the study appears to be scientifically proper. However, after reading the
manuscript carefully, it is seen to have many mistakes and errors. Hence, I recommend to reject
the manuscript for the publication at Royal Society Open Science.
The following points should be considered by authors.
- There are too many grammatical errors and punctuations, such as at Abstract section on
lines 38-40, “The optimum conditions for the removal of AOX was/were particle size 62 µm,
time 120 min, pH 2.5, temperature 40 <U+2103> ..”. In the section of 2.3. AOX content analysis on page 4
on line 5, “The basic method and process was/were as follows …”. In the section of 3.1. AOX
volatilization on page 6 on lines 6-9, “Some chloroacetic acid, 1-bromo-2-chloromethane, 1,1,2,2-
tetrachloroethane, 3-chloro-1.2-propanediol, 1,1,3,3-tetrachloroacetone, 2-chloropropionic acid
and acetyl chloride was/were volatile”. Check all errors throughout the manuscript. English
should be improved. Also, check the sentence on page 5, line 50, “Chlorobenzene and
chlorobenzene were the most abundant and unmanageable organic chlorides.
- In the section of 1. Introduction, on page 2, lines 26-27, “Each country has specific
regulations on AOX emission limits of bleaching effluent.” You should give examples and their
AOX emission limits of bleaching effluent.
- In the section of 2.2. Chloride dioxide bleaching, on page 3 line 40, “The concentration of
mixture was 10%.” 10% is w/w, V/V, or w/V? “The mixture was thoroughly mixed for 5 min.”
How did you mix it? How many rpm? Please explain chloride dioxide bleaching more clearly.
- In the section of 3.1. Volatilization on page 5 on lines 44-46, “The amount of AOX
remains unchanged at 45 d, AOX had basically no volatile components.” Are you sure? The
similar result you obtained is seen from 10 d to 15 d in Fig. 1, but it decreased after 15 d. How do
you know that it will not decrease after 45 d? I think it is still decreasing from 40 d to 45 d. You
should check the amount of AOX for 50 d and also 55 d.
- In the section of 3.5. Effect of pH on adsorption capacity, pH effect on AOX adsorption
was not explained sufficiently. There are unnecessary repetitions. You should explain pH effect
with surface charges and AOX molecule structures.
- In the section of 3.6. Effect of temperature on adsorption capacity on page 11 on lines 49-
52, “The adsorption process is very sensitive to temperature as an exothermic process.
Appropriately increasing the temperature facilitates the rapid reaction ….” What is your process
type of AOX adsorption on AC (physical or chemical adsorption)? What about <U+0394>G°, <U+0394>H°, and
<U+0394>S°?
4
- In the section of 3.9. FTIR analysis on page 15 on lines 34-36, “Fig. 8a was FTIR of
activated carbon without adsorbing AOX, and Fig. 8b was FTIR of activated carbon with
adsorbing AOX.” However, in Fig. 8, a with absorption and b without absorption. Also, in the
figure caption on page 15 line 27 “Fig. 8 FTIR spectra of activated carbon with or without
adsorption (a with absorption, b without absorption). You should check and correct them.
Moreover, you should use adsorption and absorption terms properly.

The authors report a study on the adsorption of organic chlorides (AOX) in bleaching effluent by
activated carbon. The effect of activated carbon particle size, adsorption pH, adsorption
temperature, adsorbent dosage, adsorption time on AOX adsorption was researched. Also,
volatilization and degradation of AOX were studied for the elimination of their effects on AOX
adsorption. The authors completed most of corrections suggested before and revised the
manuscript. However, there are still incompletes. Thus, I recommend to accept the manuscript
for the publication at Royal Society Open Science, after major revision.
The following points should be considered by authors carefully.
A) In 2.2. Chlorine dioxide bleaching, on page 3, lines 40-.. “First, 10 g unbleached dry pulp was
mixed with pure water ..” In 2.3. AOX content analysis on page 4, lines 11-12, “A multi X2500
AOX analyzer (Jena, Germany) was employed to identify the AOX present in the bleaching
effluent …” In 3.5. Effect of the pH on the adsorption capacity on page 9, lines 31-45 “The
adsorption effect improved with a decrease in pH. However, the adsorption capacity decreased at
pH values <U+02C2>2.5. This occurred because the solubility of the adsorbent was affected by the pH of
the solution. Thus, the solubility of the organic chloride increased under strong acidic conditions
making adsorption by activated carbon difficult”. What do you think about organic halogens may
react with H2O in acidic media? For example, acetyl chloride reacts vigorously with water to
generate gaseous HCl. I really wonder whether this affects your calculations.
B) “The solubility of the adsorbent was affected by the pH of the solution.” How do you know
that? Is activated carbon soluble? Where is the point of zero charge (PZC) of your activated
carbon?
C) Where is FTIR spectrum, and what are the functional groups on the activated carbon to
explain the interactions with adsorbates?
D) Also, you studied the effect of activated carbon particle size, adsorption pH, adsorption
temperature, adsorbent dosage, adsorption time on AOX adsorption. Can you specify the
adsorbate or adsorbates you studied and calculated in adsorption experiments because there is
one line in each graph? Or are they the total amount of AOXs? Readers want to see it more
clearly.
E) Furthermore, you can find some research of activated carbon for organic adsorption in the
suggested papers below.

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
Dear Reviewer,
Thank you for your letter and for the comments concerning our
manuscript entitled “Adsorptive removal of adsorbable organic
halogens by activated carbon”. We have studied your comments
carefully and have made corrections which we hope could meet your
requirements. All changes have been highlighted in the revised version
(red highlighting).
Questions you put forward are explained as follows:
Reviewer #1:
1) 2.2. Chlorine dioxide bleaching. 10 g of unbleached dry
pulp or lignin was mixed with pure water in a sealed
polyethylene bag. Readers wonder why there is lignin.
It has been amended in the revised version. ”10 g of unbleached
dry pulp or lignin was mixed with pure water in a sealed
polyethylene bag”.
2) In the introduction, readers want to know about the
research progress of AOX removal. Some research of
activated carbon for organic adsorption.
Some research of activated carbon for organic adsorption has
been added. ” The anionic toxic contaminant Congo red has
been adsorbed by activated carbon. This has led to the
production of highly efficient low-cost materials of large
capacity to remove anionic ionizable organic contaminants”.
3) 2.6. Chemical composition analysis of bleaching effluent.
GC-MS detection should be divided into two parts. The first
part is the chemical composition analysis of bleaching
effluent after degradation or volatilization. The second part
is the chemical composition analysis of bleaching effluent
with or without activated carbon adsorption.
It has been revised according to your opinion.
4) Chlorobenzene and chlorophenol are adsorbed by
activated carbon. What is its adsorption mechanism,
physical adsorption or chemical adsorption<U+FF1F>
Descriptions of the adsorption mechanism were added. See
section 3.8 for details.
Reviewer #2:
1) There are too many grammatical errors and
punctuations Check all errors throughout the manuscript.
English should be improved. Also, check the sentence on
page 5, line 50, “Chlorobenzene and chlorobenzene were
the most abundant and unmanageable organic chlorides.
The grammatical errors and punctuations had been corrected in
the revised version. Such as “Chlorobenzene and chlorophenol
were the most abundant and unmanageable AOX components
(60.80% of the total organic chlorides)”.
2) In the section of 1. Introduction, on page 2, lines 26-27,
“Each country has specific regulations on AOX emission
limits of bleaching effluent.” You should give examples and
their AOX emission limits of bleaching effluent.
The examples were added in the revised version. “Thus, each
country has specific regulations on AOX emission limits in
bleaching effluents: Switzerland = 0.1–0.2 kg.tp-1, Finland =
0.2–0.4 kg.tp-1, Canada = 0.25 kg.tp-1, America = 0.272 kg.tp-1,
and China = 0.72 kg.tp-1”.
3) In the section of 2.2. Chloride dioxide bleaching, on page
3 line 40, “The concentration of mixture was 10%.” 10% is
w/w, V/V, or w/V? “The mixture was thoroughly mixed for
5 min.” How did you mix it? How many rpm? Please
explain chloride dioxide bleaching more clearly.
It has been amended in the revised version. “First, 10 g
unbleached dry pulp was mixed with pure water in a sealed
polyethylene bag [mixture concentration = 10% (w/V)]. The
mixture was kneaded every 5 min during the reaction and
sufficient contact between the pulp and chlorine dioxide
solution was ensured.”
4) In the section of 3.1. Volatilization on page 5 on lines
44-46, “The amount of AOX remains unchanged at 45 d,
AOX had basically no volatile components.” Are you sure?
The similar result you obtained is seen from 10 d to 15 d in
Fig. 1, but it decreased after 15 d. How do you know that it
will not decrease after 45 d? I think it is still decreasing
from 40 d to 45 d. You should check the amount of AOX for
50 d and also 55 d.
This lower value remained constant throughout the rest of the
testing period (day 30 to day 45) indicating that no volatile
components were present in the AOX during this period.
5) In the section of 3.5. Effect of pH on adsorption capacity,
pH effect on AOX adsorption was not explained sufficiently.
There are unnecessary repetitions. You should explain pH
effect with surface charges and AOX molecule structures.
It has been added in the revised version. “The ionization of
acidic groups, such as carboxyl and phenol hydroxyl groups, on
the surface of the activated carbon was inhibited under acidic
conditions. Thus, maintaining the state of electrical neutrality is
conducive to the adsorption of non-polar organics and phenols.
The adsorption effect improved with a decrease in pH.
However, the adsorption capacity decreased at pH values <U+02C2>2.5.
This occurred because the solubility of the adsorbent was
affected by the pH of the solution. Thus, the solubility of the
organic chloride increased under strong acidic conditions
making adsorption by activated carbon difficult.”
6) In the section of 3.6. Effect of temperature on adsorption
capacity on page 11 on lines 49-52, “The adsorption process
is very sensitive to temperature as an exothermic process.
Appropriately increasing the temperature facilitates the
rapid reaction ….” What is your process type of AOX
adsorption on AC (physical or chemical adsorption)? What
about <U+0394>G°, <U+0394>H°, and <U+0394>S°?
In the section of 3.8. “Adsorption Thermodynamics”. The
adsorption thermodynamics parameters <U+0394>G° <0, <U+0394>H° >0, and
<U+0394>S° >0 suggest that the adsorption was a spontaneous entropy
increasing process of heat absorption. The results revealed that
AOX adsorption by activated carbon was a chemical adsorption
process.
7) In the section of 3.9. FTIR analysis on page 15 on lines
34-36, “Fig. 8a was FTIR of activated carbon without
adsorbing AOX, and Fig. 8b was FTIR of activated carbon
with adsorbing AOX.” However, in Fig. 8, a with
absorption and b without absorption. Also, in the figure
caption on page 15 line 27 “Fig. 8 FTIR spectra of activated
carbon with or without adsorption (a with absorption, b
without absorption). You should check and correct them.
Moreover, you should use adsorption and absorption terms
properly.
The description of FTIR is not detailed enough. It was replaced
by adsorption thermodynamic studies. See section 3.8 for
details.
As a whole, issues the editors suggested are very pertinent, which are
very helpful to modified my entire paper and thank you very much
again.
Appendix B
Dear Reviewer,
Thank you for your letter and for the comments concerning our
manuscript entitled “Adsorptive removal of adsorbable organic
halogens by activated carbon”. We have studied your comments
carefully and have made corrections which we hope could meet your
requirements. All changes have been highlighted in the revised version
(red highlighting).
Questions you put forward are explained as follows:
Reviewer #1:
This manuscript is ready for publication.
Thank you for your comments.
Reviewer #2:
A) In 2.2. Chlorine dioxide bleaching, on page 3, lines 40-..
“First, 10 g unbleached dry pulp was mixed with pure
water..” In 2.3. AOX content analysis on page 4, lines 11-12,
“A multi X2500 AOX analyzer (Jena, Germany) was
employed to identify the AOX present in the bleaching
effluent …” In 3.5. Effect of the pH on the adsorption
capacity on page 9, lines 31-45 “The adsorption effect
improved with a decrease in pH. However, the adsorption
capacity decreased at pH values <U+02C2>2.5. This occurred
because the solubility of the adsorbent was affected by the
pH of the solution. Thus, the solubility of the organic
chloride increased under strong acidic conditions making
adsorption by activated carbon difficult”. What do you
think about organic halogens may react with H2O in acidic
media? For example, acetyl chloride reacts vigorously with
water to generate gaseous HCl. I really wonder whether this
affects your calculations.
The adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) mainly comes from the
reaction of residual lignin and chlorinated bleaching agent
during bleaching. AOX were comprised of at least four
components: small molecule organicchlorides, macromolecular
organic chlorides, chlorobenzene and chlorophenol. Lignin
shows two trends in the reaction process. The first is the open -
loop degradation of lignin. Chain-like organic chloride is
formed. Most of these organic chlorides are water-soluble. The
second is that a chlorine substitution reaction occurs on the
lignin benzene ring, in which chlorobenzene or chlorophenol is
formed. Chlorobenzene and chlorophenol have stable structure
and low reactivity. Bleaching conditions are acidic and most
organic halogens do not react with water. The presence of a
small amount of acetyl chloride does not affect the calculation.
B) “The solubility of the adsorbent was affected by the pH
of the solution.” How do you know that? Is activated
carbon soluble? Where is the point of zero charge (PZC) of
your activated carbon?
Sorry, it's a handwriting error. “The solubility of the adsorbate
was affected by the pH of the solution.”
C) Where is FTIR spectrum, and what are the functional
groups on the activated carbon to explain the interactions
with adsorbates?
The change of activated carbon functional group with or
without adsorption was detected by FTIR spectrum. The aim is
to explain the essence of AOX adsorption by activated carbon
(physical or chemical adsorption). But the results of FTIR are
not enough to explain the essence of adsorption. It was replaced
by adsorption thermodynamic studies. The results of adsorption
thermodynamics show that the adsorption of AOX by activated
carbon is chemical adsorption. The manuscript's description of
FTIR spectrum was deleted.
D) Also, you studied the effect of activated carbon particle
size, adsorption pH, adsorption temperature, adsorbent
dosage, adsorption time on AOX adsorption. Can you
specify the adsorbate or adsorbates you studied and
calculated in adsorption experiments because there is one
line in each graph? Or are they the total amount of AOXs?
Readers want to see it more clearly.
The adsorbate or adsorbates studied and calculated in the
adsorption experiment are the total amount of AOXs. It has
been detailed in the revised version.
E) Furthermore, you can find some research of activated
carbon for organic adsorption in the suggested papers
below.
The research of activated carbon for organic adsorption is
studied carefully. These excellent references are cited in the
revised version.
As a whole, issues the editors suggested are very pertinent, which are
very helpful to modified my entire paper and thank you very much
again.
