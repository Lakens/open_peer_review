A numerical method is proposed in order to simulate the wake-induced oscillation of a bundle
conductor line. The method that the effect of aerodynamic and electromagnetic forces both
varying with distance between two sub-conductors is considered at the same time is novel and
valuable, which is helpful in studying the wake-induced oscillation characteristic of a bundle
conductor line. I think this manuscript can be accepted after minor revise. However, there are a
few points that the authors should consider to improve the manuscript.
(1) In Page 19, Line 357-361, “The Rayleigh damping model is usually employed to depict the
damping of transmission lines. ... The critical damping ratio of 0.5% is used in the following
investigation.” Is the critical damping ratio (0.5%) corresponding to the first mode or each mode
of the conductor line? Please describe clearly.
(2) In Table 3 (Page 25) and Fig.13(d) (Page 27), is there any relationship between global and local
frequencies of 400m-span line and the following analysis? If there is, please describe the
relationship in the paper. If not, it is a little needless, which could be deleted.
3
(3) Spelling should be checked, for example, in Page 11, Line 217, “the sub-conductor modles”
should be “the sub-conductor models”. In Page 21, Line 384, “in the follows” should be “as
follows” or “in the following sections”. Besides, grammatical mistakes also should be corrected.

heading is not relevant to your paper, please nevertheless include the heading and explicitly state
that it is not relevant to your work.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days (i.e. by the 19-Apr-2018). If you do not think
you will be able to meet this date please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
5
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science will introduce article processing charges for all new
submissions received from 1 January 2018. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to Royal
Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers submitted
as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry
(http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/chemistry).
If your manuscript is newly submitted and subsequently accepted for publication after 1 Jan 2018,
you will be asked to pay the article processing charge, unless you request a waiver and this is
approved by Royal Society Publishing. Manuscripts originally submitted prior to 1 Jan 2018 will
not subject to a charge, even if they are accepted in 2018. You can find out more about the charges
at http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/page/charges. Should you have any queries, please
contact openscience@royalsociety.org.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look

in the following investigation.” Is the critical damping ratio (0.5%) corresponding to
the first mode or each mode of the conductor line? Please describe clearly.
Response: The damping ratio of 0.5% is corresponding to the first mode of the
conductor line. Please see line 361.
(2) In Table 3 (Page 25) and Fig.13(d) (Page 27), is there any relationship between
global and local frequencies of 400m-span line and the following analysis? If there is,
please describe the relationship in the paper. If not, it is a little needless, which could
be deleted.
Response: The global and local frequencies of 400m-span line are not used in the
following analysis. So they have been deleted. Please see Table 3 (Page 25) and
Fig.13. (Page 27).
(3) Spelling should be checked, for example, in Page 11, Line 217, “the sub-
conductor modles” should be “the sub-conductor models”. In Page 21, Line 384, “in
the follows” should be “as follows” or “in the following sections”. Besides,
grammatical mistakes also should be corrected.
Response: The spelling and grammatical mistakes have been corrected. Please see
line 217 and 385. Besides, the other details about expression are also modified and
improved, which are marked in blue.
