I applaud the efforts of the authors to put context around this important yet neglected field. I will
not pretend to fully understand their mathematical equations, so my review and suggestions
focus on the conceptual framework which underlies their assumptions and hypotheses.
These authors display an excellent grasp of the scientific issues at hand. One deficiency though is
that they may not be aware of recently published work from a group in Utah who have created a
mouse model of neocytolysis, also analyzed red blood cell counts in human newborns born at
altitude, and they confirm that neocytolysis is real, suggest that it is effected by changes in the
ability to resist oxidative stress, and that hypoxia-sensing factors are more responsible than
changes in EPO. I personally don’t feel that these conclusions match all the known data about the
process of neocytolysis, but I think these authors should acknowledge this theory and make some
brief response to it. I would refer them to Song J, J Mol Med (Berl) 93: 857-66, 2015; and to Divoky
V, J Mol Med (Berl) 94: 597-608, 2016.
The authors must correct their misunderstanding in section 3C that “astronauts are exposed to
abnormally high partial pressures of oxygen.” Spaceflight anemia has been observed in every
single astronaut who has gone into space for at least 3 days. One of the early (now discredited)
hypotheses to explain spaceflight anemia was that oxidative damage to the RBC membranes was
caused by the high oxygen environment. However, after the Challenger disaster in 1986, it was
realized that high cabin oxygen pressure was dangerous and that it was completely unnecessary
– all subsequent spaceflights have used ambient air (O2 pressure 20%) in the cabin, and there is
no change in the degree of anemia.
This brings up a couple of points that should be addressed in these authors’ discussion (and also
by the Utah group). They cite correction of hypoxia as the precipitating factor for neocytolysis,
but astronauts are not hypoxic – rather, it appears that changes in red cell mass and EPO
secretion are paramount --at first adaptive, then become maladaptive, then neocytolysis ensues.
Do the authors want to mention and propose a mechanism for this? Can renal sensors detect
elevated red cell mass/ elevated blood viscosity, and how? (It seems a stretch me to believe that
renal receptors are sensing an impairment in oxygen delivery mediated by the reduced blood
flow that accompanies higher hematocrit.) And would these authors agree that this points to a
central role of EPO rather than HIF in initiating the process, a concept further supported by EPO
injections abrogating neocytolysis in descending high altitude dwellers?
Did I miss it in this paper, but do the authors have any idea of the mechanism by which high EPO
situations could lead to an increased expression of CD47 on young RBCs (neocytes), thus priming
them to die when EPO is suppressed? I do understand (and we hypothesized and published
data) that macrophages have EPO receptors and can become more phagocytic with changes in
EPO levels. And while neocytes expressing more CD47 could explain the situation with high
altitude where EPO is first high and then suppressed, I’m not sure I understand how this explains
the situation in astronauts. Also, I want to raise for consideration (and hopefully for some
comment in the manuscript) that it is not really a question of whether an RBC survives 11 days or
120 days – under conditions favoring neocytolysis (such as descent from altitude, emergence
from the womb, re-entry into gravity field), the majority of RBCs less than 10-11 days old are
destroyed very quickly, within one week – in other words, many of these red cells that have been
alive for a day or two become destroyed within another day or two.
All this having been said, I only ask the authors to make some comment on these issues, not
expecting them to solve all riddles. I again applaud their efforts to conceptualize factors
contributing to normal and shortened red cell survival, helping to make more sense of this, with
implications pertaining to a range of human situations and disorders.

anks for your report on our manuscript. Below, please find our on the points you raised.
“I applaud the efforts of the authors to put context around this important yet neglected field. I will not
tend to fully understand their mathematical equations, so my review and suggestions focus on the
nceptual framework which underlies their assumptions and hypotheses.”
very much appreciate the overall comments of this referee, and we thank the explicit remark on the
evance of this field.
“These authors display an excellent grasp of the scientific issues at hand. One deficiency though is that

a matter of fact, although we have tried to conduct an exhaustive review of the available literature, we
d missed the recent work of this group. After carefully reading these papers we have included a
mmentary on the potential role of hypoxia-sensing factors in our discussion. Nevertheless, some of the
dences presented in this work to support the role of HIF in neocytolysis can also be related to changes
EPO. For instance, they show that dimethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG), an inhibitor of a negative regulator
HIF, attenuated neocytolysis. However, the authors do not show how this drug is affecting EPO
duction. It could be the case that an increase in HIF might lead to greater EPO production by kidney
roblasts, which in turn would be expected to reduce the observed effects of neocytolysis. In any case,
th EPO and HIF might be playing a role in setting RBC lifespan.
“The authors must correct their misunderstanding in section 3C that “astronauts are exposed to
normally high partial pressures of oxygen.” Spaceflight anemia has been observed in every single
ronaut who has gone into space for at least 3 days. One of the early (now discredited) hypotheses to

ygen pressure was dangerous and that it was completely unnecessary – all subsequent spaceflights

agree with the referee that this is an overstatement on our part. Our original idea was that astronauts
ght be subject to high levels of oxygen during ascent phases of spatial flights. However, we have not
nd any solid reference to support the assumption that this might suffice to induce observed changes in
O, so we have decided to remove this phrase from the text.
“This brings up a couple of points that should be addressed in these authors’ discussion (and also by
Utah group). They cite correction of hypoxia as the precipitating factor for neocytolysis, but astronauts
not hypoxic – rather, it appears that changes in red cell mass and EPO secretion are paramount --at

thors agree that this points to a central role of EPO rather than HIF in initiating the process, a concept
ther supported by EPO injections abrogating neocytolysis in descending high altitude dwellers?”
a matter of fact, we do not suggest that hypoxia is the precipitating factor for neocytolysis. Quite the
posite, as we discuss in the text, neocytolysis (and autoimmunity against host RBCs) would be triggered
a decrease in the levels of EPO, which is usually (but not exclusively) caused by an increase in oxygen
ailability. Hence, neocytolysis is a response to hyperoxia, i.e., to situations in which oxygen supply is
ove physiological needs. Neocytolysis has been described in subjects that move from hypoxia to
rmoxia. In these cases, an organism that has adapted to lower oxygen availability (by increasing the
mber of RBCs) is exposed to increased levels of oxygen. This implies that the number of RBCs is
mporarily above physiological needs, so the organism must remove the excess of cells. Neocytolysis,
ether with potential autoimmune responses against healthy RBCs, rapidly reduce the number of
culating cells. We suggest in the text that these mechanisms might be triggered in response to
ctuations in EPO, irrespectively of the causes of such fluctuations. It should also be expected to observe
anges in HIF caused by hypoxia, and we have included a few lines in the discussion to indicate how
veral factors might simultaneously contribute to observed changes in RBC lifespan.
“Did I miss it in this paper, but do the authors have any idea of the mechanism by which high EPO
uations could lead to an increased expression of CD47 on young RBCs (neocytes), thus priming them to
when EPO is suppressed? I do understand (and we hypothesized and published data) that
crophages have EPO receptors and can become more phagocytic with changes in EPO levels. And while
ocytes expressing more CD47 could explain the situation with high altitude where EPO is first high and
n suppressed, I’m not sure I understand how this explains the situation in astronauts.”
are currently working on this subject. In particular we are studying the link between the levels of
culating EPO and the amount of CD47 expression in newly formed RBCs. One of the potential
chanisms that might account for higher levels of CD47 in conditions of higher concentrations of EPO
uld be the following. Suppose that CD47 expression in erythroid precursors decreases with time at a
nstant rate. Then, the longer it takes for a precursor cell to divide, the lower the amount of CD47 in
ughter cells. In this scenario, an increase of EPO would accelerate the rate of division of precursor cells,
., it would shorten the division time of these cells. Therefore, it would eventually increase CD47
pression in neocytes. This mechanism could be complementary to changes in macrophage phagocytic
ivity in response to changes in EPO. However, this is just a working hypothesis, and we have decided
t to include it in this paper. Instead, it will be (hopefully) discussed in more depth in a future article.
“Also, I want to raise for consideration (and hopefully for some comment in the manuscript) that it is
t really a question of whether an RBC survives 11 days or 120 days – under conditions favoring
ocytolysis (such as descent from altitude, emergence from the womb, re-entry into gravity field), the
jority of RBCs less than 10-11 days old are destroyed very quickly, within one week – in other words,
ny of these red cells that have been alive for a day or two become destroyed within another day or
o.”
are not sure to have fully understood this question. In our opinion, the relevance of changes in RBC
span is that they allow changing the rate of RBC destruction. If RBC lifespan were fixed (say, for
tance 120 days), then the rate of RBC destruction would just mimic the rate of RBC production, only
h a delay of 120 days. A ten-fold reduction in the lifespan of a fraction of RBCs accelerates cell
struction, and helps to rapidly adjust the number of cells to the needs of the organism. As we comment
the manuscript, the question of whether RBCs survive 11 or 120 days is determined by the same set of
chanisms, namely the dynamics of PS and CD47 in the membrane of RBCs, together with the initial
ount of CD47 expression, which in turn depends on the levels of EPO.
“All this having been said, I only ask the authors to make some comment on these issues, not
pecting them to solve all riddles. I again applaud their efforts to conceptualize factors contributing to
rmal and shortened red cell survival, helping to make more sense of this, with implications pertaining to
ange of human situations and disorders.”
thank again this referee for such positive comments on this work.
