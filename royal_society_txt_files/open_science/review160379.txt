This manuscript describes characterization of the wsv023’s function. The interaction of this
protein and the L. vannamei gamma complex associated protein 2 (LvGCP2) was proved by co-
immunoprecipitation and pull-down assay. Knocking down of the wsv023 transcript and
inhibition of the PERK-eIF2a pathway reduced the WSSV copy number and shrimp mortality of
the wssv-infected shrimp. Over-expression of wsv023 in 293T cells and WSSV infection in shrimp
decreased the microtubules formation suggesting that the wsv023 plays a role in microtubules
organization of shrimp cells. While the work provides some information that might disclose the
relationship between WSSV and UPR in shrimp, however, the authors should clarify the
following aspects and mention in the manuscript. Some points are lacked especially point no 1
and 4. More evidences may be needed.
1. In the abstract (line 28-29), knocking down of LvATF4 reduced the WSSV copy number
and shrimp mortality of WSSV infected shrimp suggested that wsv023 is critical to WSSV
infection. What is the link of your result to wsv023? Did the LvATF4 suppression affect the level
of wsv023 transcript of the WSSV infected shrimp? Otherwise it’s too early to conclude like that.
2. Why do the authors test the tubulin polymerization in 293T cells not in insect cells?
3. To confirm the role of wsv023 in microtubules organization, in the opposite way of over
expression of wsv023, why don’t the authors determine the tubulin polymerization when the
wsv023 was knocked down.
4. How do the authors link the PERK-eIF2a pathway to the wsv023? Have the authors
check the level of wsv023 transcript and the tubulin polymerization after the PERK-eIF2a
pathway was inhibited in the WSSV infected shrimp?
Some specific issues to be considered and corrected.
1. In the result (line 278), no figure 2C.
2. In the result (line 291), the percentage of cumulative mortality is not correspond with the
graph in figure 3C.
3. Spelling check throughout the manuscript.

General comments: This manuscript deals with the interaction between Litopenaeus vannamei
core protein of <U+03B3>-tubulin small complex (gamma complex associated protein 2 [LvGCP2]) and
white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) gene wsv023. By co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down
assays it was proved that wsv023 interacted with LvGCP2. Silencing wsv023 significantly
reduced WSSV copy number in L. vannamei muscle and cumulative mortality of infected shrimp.
A similar result was obtained when LvATF4 was silenced. When wsv023 gene was over-
expressed in 293T cells, microtubule formation was greatly disrupted, showing the function of
this gene in virus replication.
The manuscript is interesting and it gives insight into the function of a previously unknown viral
gene wsv023. The inhibition of WSSV infection using dsRNA against wsv023 or the substance
Salubrinal represent potential alternatives to WSSV control. Nonetheless, the manuscript requires
an overall English review for clarity and authors require answering some doubts on
methodology. Other specific comments are given below.
Specific comments:
Abstract:
Comment 1. Lines 25 -27 should say: “A previous study found the key transcription factor of
Litopenaeus vannamei PERK-eIF2a pathway cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor 4
(LvATF4) was involved in the transcriptional regulation of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV)
gene wsv023”.
Comment 2. Lines 28 – 30 should say: “The knocked-down expression of LvATF4 reduced the
viral copy number and the cumulative mortality of WSSV infected shrimp. These results
suggested that wsv023 is critical to WSSV infection but the precise function of wsv023 was still
unknown.
Comment 3. Line 35 should say: “Silencing LvATF4 also showed reduced virus copy number and
abrogated shrimp mortality.
Author summary:
Comment 4. Line 50 should say: “...but is also important...”
Comment 5. Line 51: change the words “has been” for the word “was”.
Comment 6. Line 52: change the words “genes regulation” for the words “gene regulation”
Comment 7. Lines 57-60 should say: “Down-regulation of wsv023 expression or inhibition of the
PERK-eIF2a pathway by Salubrinal, significantly reduced WSSV copy number in L. vannamei
muscle, and the cumulative mortality of WSSV infected-shrimp.
Comment 8. Lines 60 – 62 should say: “Furthermore, over-expression of wsv023 in 293T cells
could disrupt the formation of microtubules. A similar result was obtained in shrimp hemocytes
infected with WSSV.”
Comment 9. Author ´s abstract is much better explained than the abstract. It is suggested that
author’s abstract be used as the main abstract.
Introduction:
Comment 10. Line 72 should say: “Microtubules are...”
6
Comment 11. line 75. Remove the comma after the word “transduction”.
Comment 12. Line 90. Please define the meaning of NEDD1.
Comment 13. Line 95. Remove the apostrophe sign in the word “cells’ ”
Comment 14. Lines 100 – 102 should say: “The matrix protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus
interacted with tubulin in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that a cytopathic effect was caused by
these interactions [11].”
Comment 15. Lines 102 -103. Please indicate what cell type is HSV-1. Did authors mean herpes
simplex virus-1 infected cells? If so, then this sentence talks about another example of viral
infection that disrupts function of microtubules in cells. Please explain in detail.
Comment 16. Line 106. Please change the words “such cytoskeleton modulation” for the words
“cytoskeleton modulation in shrimp cells”
Comment 17. Lines 108 – 110 should say: “The present study proved that WSSV gene wsv023
interacted with Litopenaeus vannamei GCP2 (LvGCP2), the core member of <U+03B3>- TuSC.”
Comment 18. Line 111 should say: “Silencing expression of wsv023...”
Comment 19. Line 114 should say: “...organization via wsv023, profitting from this process.”
Material and methods:
Comment 20. Line 134. Remove the word “of”.
Comment 21. Line 140. Please check the word “BP-LveGFP”. Is this actually the word MBP-
LveGFP?
Comment 22 line 140 should say: “...each of these pairs were then...”
Comment 23 line 144 should say: “The beads were then collected, extensively washed and...”
Comment 24 Line 162. Please define which buffer was used to wash the stained cells at 37 °C.
Also, please describe the meaning of HBSS.
Comment 25. Line 164. Please describe what does autokinetic mean.
Comment 26. Lines 172-174. Please include a brief description of how the dsRNA wsv023-T7
primers were constructed.
Comment 27. Section 2.6. The methods to measure RNA expression of human tubulines in 293T
cells by real-time PCR are not described. Please include such methods as they are mentioned in
section 2.4.
Comment 28. Lines 186. Change the word “were” for the word “was” and the word “injection”
for the word “inoculation”.
Comment 29. Line 187 should say: “From each sample, total RNA was...”
Comment 30. Lines 198-199: The apostrophe in the 5 and 3 ends of the primer sequences appears
as a “9”. Please correct this (5’ and 3’).
Comment 31. Lines 199 - 204: Please re-write the paragraph. It is unclear how many shrimp were
treated with each dsRNA and how many shrimp from each treatment received only PBS or the
WSSV dose (104 virus copies).
7
Comment 32. Lines 206 - 207. Please change the words “For the copy numbers of WSSV virion
detection...” for the words “to determine WSSV copy number...” Also, please define the exact
number of shrimp treated with each type of dsRNA for viral load calculation.
Comment 33. Why authors used muscle to measure WSSV viral load? It would have been
interesting to know the viral load in other WSSV target organs such as gill or hemolymph.
Comment 34. Section 2.8. What was the concentration of DMSO used as control to salubrinal?
Please include this datum.
Results:
Comment 35. Lines 234 - 235: Please re-write this sentence in order to increase clarity. Comment
36. Lines 237 – 239. Please indicate what is the difference between wsv023 (V5) and LvGCP2
(Flag) interaction and that with LvGCP2 (Flag) and wsv023 (V5). Comment 37. Lines 256 should
say: “... whereas blast analysis (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) revealed...”
Comment 37. Lines 263 – 265 should say: “Treatment with wsv023 dsRNA on WSSV infected
shrimp, effectively suppressed its expression in L. vannamei hemocytes as shown by RT-PCR
assay [Fig. 2A(a)].”
Comment 38. The abbreviation (hpi) should always be referred to as hours post inoculation
throughout the manuscript.
Comment 39. Lines 266 – 271 should be reduced to: “Shrimps treated with wsv023 dsRNA and
challenged with WSSV had a cumulative mortality of 60% at 168 hpi. In contrast, groups mock
treated with eGFP dsRNA or PBS had cumulative mortalities of 92% and 100% at 168 hpi,
respectively [Fig. 2A(b)].
Comment 40. Lines 272-280. These lines should better be summarized in a table showing the time
points and the amount of WSSV copies in each treatment (wsv023, eGFP and control).
Comment 41. Lines 282-285. This sentence is methodology. It does not belong to results. Remove
it.
Comment 42. Lines 288 -291. These lines state that DMSO had a better effect than salubrinal
against WSSV infection. This statement is contrary to what figure 3C shows. Please put the
correct data accordingly.
Comment 43. Line 298 should say: “Western blot results showed...”
Comment 44. Lines 300 – 302 should say: “...given that <U+03B3>-TuSC is critical for initiating all new
microtubules [3], the present results suggested that wsv023 interacted with LvGCP2, and might
therefore influence...”
Comment 45. Lines 310 -315 should say: “The relative expression levels of Lva- Tubulin and
Lvß-Tubulin reached peak values at 24 and 30 hpi and were approximately 1.5- and 1.3-fold that
of the control respectively. Flow cytometry assay indicated that WSSV infection significantly
reduced microtubule formation in shrimp L. vannamei hemocytes by about 16% at 72 hpi (Fig.
5B).
Discussion
Comment 46. Lines 318 – 323 should say: “Blast analysis showed that wsv023 was similar (% of
similarity?) to the gcp3 sequence of species such as Homo sapiens. Other assays (Co-IP and pull-
down) proved that wsv023 could interact with the core protein GCP2 of <U+03B3>-TuSC in L. vannamei.
Further, silencing wsv023 reduced WSSV copy number in muscle and cumulative mortality of
WSSV-infected shrimps.”
Comment 47. Lines 324 -325 should say: “These results indicate that wsv023 influences
microtubule synthesis and organization in WSSV-infected cells in shrimp.” Comment 48. Lines
327 – 329. Please re-write the sentence to make clear what authors want to say about the unique
sequence of ORFs contained in the WSSV genomes sequenced so far.
Comment 49. Lines 333 - 335 should say: “...whereas its role in WSSV infection was still unclear.
The wsv023 sequence was found to be similar to the N-terminal end of GCP3, which had 35.2%
identity to HsGCP3 and 31.3% identity to LvGCP3.
Comment 50. Line 342. Change the word “enveloped” for the word “envelope” Comment 51.
Line 363. Change the word “decrese” for the word “decrease”
8
Comment 52. Lines 364 – 366 should say: “The wsv023 product is similar to the N- terminal part
of GCP3, which interacts with <U+03B3>-tubulin at its C-terminal end. The wsv023 - GCP2 complex
prevented the formation of functional <U+03B3>-TuSC but the effect of this interaction needs further
investigation.”
Comment 53. Lines 367 – 379. It is proposed to reduce this paragraph to the main points:
(1) Talk about WSSV macromolecule transportation or morphology changes and need of cell
cytoskeleton and lack of direct experimental evidence;
(2) Studies that show interaction between WSSV infection and upregulation of expression of
tubulin a-1 chain, tubulin ß-1 chain, and microtubule-actin cross-linking factor 1, hence
showing the relationship between WSSV infection and changes in microtubule organization [14-
16]
(3) Discuss results obtained from flow cytometry assay and silencing of wsv023 on microtubule
synthesis and reduction of WSSV infection/virus copy number.
Comment 54. Line 380. Replace the words “To sum up, this study suggested” for the words: “In
conclusion, the present study indicates that wsv023 interacts with LvGCP2, and might disturb
microtubule formation in shrimp haemocyte, promoting WSSV infection.”
Comment 55. Figure 1A is not understandable. Please arrange the captions in their corresponding
part of the figure, in order to improve clarity and ease.
Comment 56. Why figures S1, S2 and S3 are termed like that? Would it better be called figures 2, 3
and so on? Please explain and arrange accordingly.
Comment 57. Figure 2b should be done easier. The captions should avoid use of dendrogram and
only point out that significant differences in mortality occurred between treatment with wsv023
dsRNA and the mock-treated groups (PBS and eGFP dsRNA) challenged with WSSV. In
addition, symbols used for each line should be bigger.

Title: Wsv023 Interacted with Litopenaeus vannamei <U+03B3>-tubulin Complex Associated Proteins 2,
and Decreased The Formation of Microtubules.
General comments:
This manuscript deals with the interaction between Litopenaeus vannamei core protein of <U+03B3>-
tubulin small complex (gamma complex associated protein 2 [LvGCP2]) and white spot
syndrome virus (WSSV) gene wsv023. By co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays it was
proved that wsv023 interacted with LvGCP2. Silencing wsv023 significantly reduced WSSV copy
number in L. vannamei muscle and cumulative mortality of infected shrimp. A similar result was
obtained when LvATF4 was silenced. When wsv023 gene was over-expressed in 293T cells,
microtubule formation was greatly disrupted, showing the function of this gene in virus
replication.
The manuscript is interesting and it gives insight into the function of a previously unknown viral
gene wsv023. The inhibition of WSSV infection using dsRNA against wsv023 or the substance
Salubrinal represent potential alternatives to WSSV control. After revision, the manuscript has
improved very much. Some minor corrections were done in the pdf file as comments. Some
corrections need to be addressed by the authors as well. Specific comments are given in the pdf

Title: Wsv023 Interacted with Litopenaeus vannamei <U+03B3>-tubulin Complex Associated Proteins 2,
and Decreased The Formation of Microtubules.
General comments:
This manuscript deals with the interaction between Litopenaeus vannamei core protein of <U+03B3>-
tubulin small complex (gamma complex associated protein 2 [LvGCP2]) and white spot
syndrome virus (WSSV) gene wsv023. By co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays it was
proved that wsv023 interacted with LvGCP2. Silencing wsv023 significantly reduced WSSV copy
number in L. vannamei muscle and cumulative mortality of infected shrimp. A similar result was
obtained when LvATF4 was silenced. When wsv023 gene was over-expressed in 293T cells,
microtubule formation was greatly disrupted, showing the function of this gene in virus
replication.

The manuscript is interesting and it gives insight into the function of a previously unknown viral
gene wsv023. The inhibition of WSSV infection using dsRNA against wsv023 or the substance
Salubrinal represent potential alternatives to WSSV control. After revision, the manuscript has
improved very much. Some minor corrections were done in the pdf file as comments. Some
corrections need to be addressed by the authors as well. Specific comments are given in the pdf
file attached.

Title: Wsv023 Interacted with Litopenaeus vannamei <U+03B3>-tubulin Complex Associated
Proteins 2, and Decreased The Formation of Microtubules.
General comments:
This manuscript deals with the interaction between Litopenaeus vannamei core protein
of <U+03B3>-tubulin small complex (gamma complex associated protein 2 [LvGCP2]) and white
spot syndrome virus (WSSV) gene wsv023. By co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down
assays it was proved that wsv023 interacted with LvGCP2. Silencing wsv023
significantly reduced WSSV copy number in L. vannamei muscle and cumulative

When wsv023 gene was over-expressed in 293T cells, microtubule formation was
greatly disrupted, showing the function of this gene in virus replication.
The manuscript is interesting and it gives insight into the function of a previously
unknown viral gene wsv023. The inhibition of WSSV infection using dsRNA against
wsv023 or the substance Salubrinal represent potential alternatives to WSSV control.
Nonetheless, the manuscript requires an overall English review for clarity and authors
require answering some doubts on methodology. Other specific comments are given
below.
Specific comments:
Abstract:
Comment 1. Lines 25 -27 should say: “A previous study found the key transcription
factor of Litopenaeus vannamei PERK-eIF2a pathway cyclic AMP-dependent
transcription factor 4 (LvATF4) was involved in the transcriptional regulation of white
spot syndrome virus (WSSV) gene wsv023”.
Comment 2. Lines 28 – 30 should say: “The knocked-down expression of LvATF4
reduced the viral copy number and the cumulative mortality of WSSV infected shrimp.
These results suggested that wsv023 is critical to WSSV infection but the precise
function of wsv023 was still unknown.
Comment 3. Line 35 should say: “Silencing LvATF4 also showed reduced virus copy
number and abrogated shrimp mortality.
Author summary:
Comment 4. Line 50 should say: “…but is also important…”
Comment 5. Line 51: change the words “has been” for the word “was”.
regulation”
Comment 7. Lines 57-60 should say: “Down-regulation of wsv023 expression or
inhibition of the PERK-eIF2a pathway by Salubrinal, significantly reduced WSSV copy
number in L. vannamei muscle, and the cumulative mortality of WSSV infected-shrimp.
Comment 8. Lines 60 – 62 should say: “Furthermore, over-expression of wsv023 in
293T cells could disrupt the formation of microtubules. A similar result was obtained in
shrimp hemocytes infected with WSSV.”
Comment 9. Author´s abstract is much better explained than the abstract. It is
suggested that author’s abstract be used as the main abstract.
Introduction:
Comment 10. Line 72 should say: “Microtubules are…”
Comment 11. line 75. Remove the comma after the word “transduction”.
Comment 12. Line 90. Please define the meaning of NEDD1.
Comment 13. Line 95. Remove the apostrophe sign in the word “cells’ ”
Comment 14. Lines 100 – 102 should say: “The matrix protein of the vesicular
stomatitis virus interacted with tubulin in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that a cytopathic
effect was caused by these interactions [11].”
Comment 15. Lines 102 -103. Please indicate what cell type is HSV-1. Did authors
mean herpes simplex virus-1 infected cells? If so, then this sentence talks about another
example of viral infection that disrupts function of microtubules in cells. Please explain
in detail.
Comment 16. Line 106. Please change the words “such cytoskeleton modulation” for
the words “cytoskeleton modulation in shrimp cells”
Comment 17. Lines 108 – 110 should say: “The present study proved that WSSV gene
wsv023 interacted with Litopenaeus vannamei GCP2 (LvGCP2), the core member of <U+03B3>-
TuSC.”
Comment 18. Line 111 should say: “Silencing expression of wsv023…”

process.”
Material and methods:
Comment 20. Line 134. Remove the word “of”.
Comment 21. Line 140. Please check the word “BP-LveGFP”. Is this actually the word
MBP-LveGFP?
Comment 22 line 140 should say: “…each of these pairs were then…”
Comment 23 line 144 should say: “The beads were then collected, extensively washed
and…”
37 °C. Also, please describe the meaning of HBSS.
Comment 25. Line 164. Please describe what does autokinetic mean.
Comment 26. Lines 172-174. Please include a brief description of how the dsRNA
wsv023-T7 primers were constructed.

“injection” for the word “inoculation”.
Comment 29. Line 187 should say: “From each sample, total RNA was…”
Comment 30. Lines 198-199: The apostrophe in the 5 and 3 ends of the primer
sequences appears as a “9”. Please correct this (5’ and 3’).
Comment 31. Lines 199 - 204: Please re-write the paragraph. It is unclear how many
shrimp were treated with each dsRNA and how many shrimp from each treatment
received only PBS or the WSSV dose (104 virus copies).
Comment 32. Lines 206 - 207. Please change the words “For the copy numbers of
WSSV virion detection…” for the words “to determine WSSV copy number…” Also,
please define the exact number of shrimp treated with each type of dsRNA for viral load
calculation.
Comment 33. Why authors used muscle to measure WSSV viral load? It would have
been interesting to know the viral load in other WSSV target organs such as gill or
hemolymph.

(V5) and LvGCP2 (Flag) interaction and that with LvGCP2 (Flag) and wsv023 (V5).
Comment 37. Lines 256 should say: “... whereas blast analysis
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) revealed…”
Comment 37. Lines 263 – 265 should say: “Treatment with wsv023 dsRNA on WSSV
infected shrimp, effectively suppressed its expression in L. vannamei hemocytes as
shown by RT-PCR assay [Fig. 2A(a)].”
Comment 38. The abbreviation (hpi) should always be referred to as hours post
inoculation throughout the manuscript.
Comment 39. Lines 266 – 271 should be reduced to: “Shrimps treated with wsv023
dsRNA and challenged with WSSV had a cumulative mortality of 60% at 168 hpi. In
contrast, groups mock treated with eGFP dsRNA or PBS had cumulative mortalities of
92% and 100% at 168 hpi, respectively [Fig. 2A(b)].
Comment 40. Lines 272-280. These lines should better be summarized in a table
showing the time points and the amount of WSSV copies in each treatment (wsv023,
eGFP and control).
results. Remove it.
Comment 42. Lines 288 -291. These lines state that DMSO had a better effect than
salubrinal against WSSV infection. This statement is contrary to what figure 3C shows.
Please put the correct data accordingly.
Comment 43. Line 298 should say: “Western blot results showed…”
Comment 44. Lines 300 – 302 should say: “…given that <U+03B3>-TuSC is critical for
initiating all new microtubules [3], the present results suggested that wsv023 interacted
with LvGCP2, and might therefore influence…”
Comment 45. Lines 310 -315 should say: “The relative expression levels of Lva-
Tubulin and Lvß-Tubulin reached peak values at 24 and 30 hpi and were approximately
1.5- and 1.3-fold that of the control respectively. Flow cytometry assay indicated that
WSSV infection significantly reduced microtubule formation in shrimp L. vannamei
hemocytes by about 16% at 72 hpi (Fig. 5B).
Discussion
Comment 46. Lines 318 – 323 should say: “Blast analysis showed that wsv023 was
similar (% of similarity?) to the gcp3 sequence of species such as Homo sapiens. Other
assays (Co-IP and pull-down) proved that wsv023 could interact with the core protein
GCP2 of <U+03B3>-TuSC in L. vannamei. Further, silencing wsv023 reduced WSSV copy
number in muscle and cumulative mortality of WSSV-infected shrimps.”
Comment 47. Lines 324 -325 should say: “These results indicate that wsv023
influences microtubule synthesis and organization in WSSV-infected cells in shrimp.”
Comment 48. Lines 327 – 329. Please re-write the sentence to make clear what authors
want to say about the unique sequence of ORFs contained in the WSSV genomes
sequenced so far.
Comment 49. Lines 333 - 335 should say: “…whereas its role in WSSV infection was
still unclear. The wsv023 sequence was found to be similar to the N-terminal end of
GCP3, which had 35.2% identity to HsGCP3 and 31.3% identity to LvGCP3.
Comment 50. Line 342. Change the word “enveloped” for the word “envelope”
Comment 51. Line 363. Change the word “decrese” for the word “decrease”
Comment 52. Lines 364 – 366 should say: “The wsv023 product is similar to the N-
terminal part of GCP3, which interacts with <U+03B3>-tubulin at its C-terminal end. The wsv023
- GCP2 complex prevented the formation of functional <U+03B3>-TuSC but the effect of this
interaction needs further investigation.”
Comment 53. Lines 367 – 379. It is proposed to reduce this paragraph to the main
points:
(1) Talk about WSSV macromolecule transportation or morphology changes and need
of cell cytoskeleton and lack of direct experimental evidence;
(2) Studies that show interaction between WSSV infection and upregulation of
expression of tubulin a-1 chain, tubulin ß-1 chain, and microtubule-actin cross-linking
factor 1, hence showing the relationship between WSSV infection and changes in
microtubule organization [14-16]
(3) Discuss results obtained from flow cytometry assay and silencing of wsv023 on
microtubule synthesis and reduction of WSSV infection/virus copy number.
Comment 54. Line 380. Replace the words “To sum up, this study suggested” for the
words: “In conclusion, the present study indicates that wsv023 interacts with LvGCP2,
and might disturb microtubule formation in shrimp haemocyte, promoting WSSV
infection.”
corresponding part of the figure, in order to improve clarity and ease.
Comment 56. Why figures S1, S2 and S3 are termed like that? Would it better be called
figures 2, 3 and so on? Please explain and arrange accordingly.
Comment 57. Figure 2b should be done easier. The captions should avoid use of
dendrogram and only point out that significant differences in mortality occurred
between treatment with wsv023 dsRNA and the mock-treated groups (PBS and eGFP
dsRNA) challenged with WSSV. In addition, symbols used for each line should be
bigger.
Dear editors and reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our manuscript entitled
“Wsv023 Interacted with Litopenaeus vannamei <U+03B3>-tubulin Complex Associated Proteins 2, and
Decreased The Formation of Microtubules” (RSOS-160379). The reviewers’ suggestions and
inputs were very helpful in guiding our revision of our manuscript. We have now revised the
manuscript according to the reviewers’ comments. Please note that there are two comment 37
given by Reviewer 1, and we name it as comment 37-1 and comment 37-2. Also, “Reviewer 1”
and “Reviewer 2” efers to in the decision letter seems somewath obscure. The followings are
detailed responses to the reviewers’ comments, according to our understanding.
Reviewer 1:
General comments: This manuscript deals with the interaction between Litopenaeus vannamei
core protein of <U+03B3>-tubulin small complex (gamma complex associated protein 2 [LvGCP2]) and
white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) gene wsv023. By co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down
assays it was proved that wsv023 interacted with LvGCP2. Silencing wsv023 significantly
reduced WSSV copy number in L. vannamei muscle and cumulative mortality of infected shrimp.
A similar result was obtained when LvATF4 was silenced. When wsv023 gene was over-expressed
in 293T cells, microtubule formation was greatly disrupted, showing the function of this gene in
virus replication. The manuscript is interesting and it gives insight into the function of a
previously unknown viral gene wsv023. The inhibition of WSSV infection using dsRNA against
wsv023 or the substance Salubrinal represent potential alternatives to WSSV control. Nonetheless,
the manuscript requires an overall English review for clarity and authors require answering some
doubts on methodology. Other specific comments are given below.

Respond: The sentence be rewrote as: the fluorescence value of the cells were autokinetic
Comment 26: Lines 172-174. Please include a brief description of how the dsRNA wsv023-T7
primers were constructed.
Respond: Done accordingly. Sentences “The DNA template for ssRNA synthesis consisted of
annealed DNA oligonucleotides containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. For sense ssRNA
synthesis, a DNA template containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter at its 5'-end was employed,
so the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence was added to 5'-end of the forward primer. For
antisense ssRNA synthesis, the DNA template contained a T7 RNA polymerase promoter at its
3'-end, so a T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence was added to the 5'-end of the reverse
primer.” are included in the revised manuscript. Please see lines 178-184 in the revised
manuscript.
Comment 27: Section 2.6. The methods to measure RNA expression of human tubulines in 293T

on a LightCycler 480 System (Roche, Germany) using a reaction volume of 10 mL, which
comprised 1 mL of cDNA template, 5 mL of 2× SYBR Premix Ex Taq™ II (Takara), and 500 nM
of each primer. The optimized thermal cycling parameters were as follows: 95°C for 2 min to
activate the polymerase, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 10 s.
After performing the cycling protocol, the melting curves were obtained by increasing the
temperature from 72°C to 95°C (0.5°C/s) to denature the double-stranded DNA. The results were

treated with each dsRNA and how many shrimp from each treatment received only PBS or the
WSSV dose (104 virus copies).
Respond: The paragraph has been rewritten. Please see sentences “In cumulative mortality assay,
for each treatment, 50×2 shrimps were intramuscularly injected with 6 µg (50 µL in volume) of
dswsv023, dseGFP, or PBS, respectively. 48 h later, 50 shrimps of each treatment injected with 50

point (a total of four time points), muscles of five shirmps were collected and pooled as one
sample. And there are three parallels for each time point.” has addedd to the revised manuscript to
made the description more exhaustive, please see lines 220-223. In fact, for each treatment, 60
shrimps are sufficient. And for WSSV can cause shrimps death durin the experiment, to ensure the
successful completion of the experiment, 80 shrimps are used for each treatment.
Comment 33: Why authors used muscle to measure WSSV viral load? It would have been
interesting to know the viral load in other WSSV target organs such as gill or hemolymph.
Respond: Shrimp muscle is the concentrated tissue for mature WSSV, with the higest WSSV viral
load among shrimp tissues. So shrimp muscle alaway used standard tissue for WSSV viral load
detection in such study. Gill is not suitbale for WSSV viral load detection, for it susceptible to
water environmental, for example, shrimp gill may infect with miniature zooparasite, which also
host of WSSV. WSSV viral load in hemolymph uually relatively low, and easy to cause
measurement error.
Comment 34: Section 2.8. What was the concentration of DMSO used as control to salubrinal?
Please include this datum.
Respond: Done accordingly. In this study, 0.1% DMSO is used as control to Salubrinal.We have
include this datum in the revised manuscript.
Results:
Comment 35: Lines 234 - 235: Please re-write this sentence in order to increase clarity.
Respond: We have rewritten the sentence,please see the sentence “In our previous study, tandem
affinity purification was performed which indicated that wsv023 likely interacted with LvGCP2.”
at lines 249-250 in the revised manuscript.
Comment 36: Lines 237 – 239. Please indicate what is the difference between wsv023 (V5) and
LvGCP2 (Flag) interaction and that with LvGCP2 (Flag) and wsv023 (V5).
Respond: Wsv023 fused with V5-tag and LvGCP2 fused with Flag-tag. To conform that Wsv023
(V5) could interacte with LvGCP2 (Flag), in co-ip assay Fig.1A (a), Protein G Plus/protein A
Agarose, anti-Flag antibody and cells supernatant (S2 cells lysed with NP-40 lysis buffer) were
incubated. And then anti-V5 antibody is used to detected that whether wsv023-V5 is catch by the
“Protein G Plus/protein A Agarose-anti-Flag antibody-LvGCP2-Flag” complex. And in co-ip assay
Fig.1A (b), Protein G Plus/protein A Agarose, anti-V5 antibody and cells supernatant were
incubated. And then anti-Flag antibody is used to detected that whether LvGCP2-Flag is catch by
the “Protein G Plus/protein A Agarose-anti-Flag antibody-wsv023-V5” complex.
Comment 37-1 : Lines 256 should say : “... whereas blast analysis
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) revealed...”
Respond: Done accordingly.
Comment 37-2:Lines 263 – 265 should say: “Treatment with wsv023 dsRNA on WSSV infected
shrimp, effectively suppressed its expression in L. vannamei hemocytes as shown by RT-PCR
assay [Fig. 2A(a)].”
Respond: Done accordingly.
Comment 38:The abbreviation (hpi) should always be referred to as hours post inoculation
throughout the manuscript.
Respond: Done accordingly.
Comment 39: Lines 266 – 271 should be reduced to: “Shrimps treated with wsv023 dsRNA and
challenged with WSSV had a cumulative mortality of 60% at 168 hpi. In contrast, groups mock
treated with eGFP dsRNA or PBS had cumulative mortalities of 92% and 100% at 168 hpi,
respectively [Fig. 2A(b)].
Respond: Done accordingly.
Comment 40: Lines 272-280. These lines should better be summarized in a table showing the
time points and the amount of WSSV copies in each treatment (wsv023, eGFP and control).
Respond: Done accordingly. Please see supplemental Table1.
Comment 41: Lines 282-285. This sentence is methodology. It does not belong to results.
Remove it.
Respond: Done accordingly.
Comment 42: Lines 288 -291. These lines state that DMSO had a better effect than salubrinal
against WSSV infection. This statement is contrary to what figure 3C shows. Please put the
correct data accordingly.
Respond: The sentences are replaced by “The shrimps treated with Salubrinal also had lower
cumulative mortality than the control groups. The cumulative mortalities of the DMSO injection
group, Salubrinal injection group, DMSO injection plus WSSV infection group and Salubrinal
injection plus WSSV infection group at 168 hpi were 16%, 4%, 100%, and 70%, respectively (Fig.
3B).”, please see lines 299-303 in the revised manuscript. WSSV infected shrimps that treat with
Salubrinal have lower cumulative mortality than that treat with DMSO, suggest that salubrinal has
better effect than DMSO against WSSV infection.
Comment 43: Line 298 should say: “Western blot results showed...”
Respond: Done accordingly.
Comment 44: Lines 300 – 302 should say: “...given that <U+03B3>-TuSC is critical for initiating all new
microtubules [3], the present results suggested that wsv023 interacted with LvGCP2, and might
Respond: Done accordingly.
Comment 45: Lines 310 -315 should say: “The relative expression levels of Lva-Tubulin and
Lvß-Tubulin reached peak values at 24 and 30 hpi and were approximately 1.5- and 1.3-fold that
of the control respectively. Flow cytometry assay indicated that WSSV infection significantly
reduced microtubule formation in shrimp L. vannamei hemocytes by about 16% at 72 hpi (Fig.
5B).
Respond: Done accordingly.
Discussion
Comment 46: Lines 318 – 323 should say: “Blast analysis showed that wsv023 was similar (% of
similarity?) to the gcp3 sequence of species such as Homo sapiens. Other assays (Co-IP and
pull-down) proved that wsv023 could interact with the core protein GCP2 of <U+03B3>-TuSC in L.
vannamei. Further, silencing wsv023 reduced WSSV copy number in muscle and cumulative
mortality of WSSV-infected shrimps.”
Respond: Done accordingly.
Comment 47: Lines 324 -325 should say: “These results indicate that wsv023 influences
microtubule synthesis and organization in WSSV-infected cells in shrimp.”
Respond: Done accordingly.
Comment 48: Lines 327 – 329. Please re-write the sentence to make clear what authors want to
say about the unique sequence of ORFs contained in the WSSV genomes sequenced so far.
Respond: Done accordingly. Please see sentences“Most of these ORFs encoded polypeptides that
noticeably lacked sequence homology to known proteins. This limitation made it difficult for us to
establish the functions of the WSSV proteins.”at lines 338-341 in the revised manuscript.
Comment 49: Lines 333 - 335 should say: “...whereas its role in WSSV infection was still unclear.
The wsv023 sequence was found to be similar to the N-terminal end of GCP3, which had 35.2%
identity to HsGCP3 and 31.3% identity to LvGCP3.
Respond: Done accordingly.
Comment 50: Line 342. Change the word “enveloped” for the word “envelope” .
Respond: Done accordingly.
Comment 51: Line 363. Change the word “decrese” for the word “decrease”
Respond: Done accordingly.
Comment 52: Lines 364 – 366 should say: “The wsv023 product is similar to the N- terminal part
of GCP3, which interacts with <U+03B3>-tubulin at its C-terminal end. The wsv023 - GCP2 complex
prevented the formation of functional <U+03B3>-TuSC but the effect of this interaction needs further
investigation.”
Respond: Done accordingly.
Comment 53: Lines 367 – 379. It is proposed to reduce this paragraph to the main points:
(1) Talk about WSSV macromolecule transportation or morphology changes and need of cell
cytoskeleton and lack of direct experimental evidence;
(2) Studies that show interaction between WSSV infection and upregulation of expression of
tubulin a-1 chain, tubulin ß-1 chain, and microtubule-actin cross-linking factor 1, hence showing
the relationship between WSSV infection and changes in microtubule organization [14-16]
(3) Discuss results obtained from flow cytometry assay and silencing of wsv023 on microtubule
synthesis and reduction of WSSV infection/virus copy number.
Respond: Done accordingly. Please see sentences “Previous reports have suggested that WSSV
macromolecule transportation or morphological changes utilize the cytoskeletal framework of host
cells. For example, studies have shown that WSSV infection upregulates the expression of tubulin
a-1 chain, tubulin ß-1 chain, and microtubule-actin cross-linking factor 1, which is indicative of
the relationship of WSSV infection and microtubule organization [14-16]. However, direct
experimental evidence supporting these concepts is warranted. Flow cytometry analysis indicated
that WSSV infection inhibits microtubule formation. In addition, knockdown expression of
wsv023 resulted in a decrease in WSSV copy number in the muscles of WSSV-infected L.
vannamei, as well as in its cumulative mortality. These results provide evidences that
wsv023-driven modifications in microtubule organization are also essential to WSSV infection.”
at lines 379-389 in the revised manuscript.
Comment 54: Line 380. Replace the words “To sum up, this study suggested” for the words: “In
conclusion, the present study indicates that wsv023 interacts with LvGCP2, and might disturb
microtubule formation in shrimp haemocyte, promoting WSSV infection.”
Respond: Done accordingly.
Comment 55: Figure 1A is not understandable. Please arrange the captions in their corresponding
part of the figure, in order to improve clarity and ease.
Respond: Done accordingly. Please see Fig. 1A.
Comment 56: Why figures S1, S2 and S3 are termed like that? Would it better be called figures 2,
3 and so on? Please explain and arrange accordingly.
Respond: Figures S1, S2, and S3 are rename as Supplemental figure 1, Supplemental figure 2 and
Supplemental figure 3 in the revised manuscript, for discriminates the supplemental figures from
the formally adopted figures.
Comment 57: Figure 2b should be done easier. The captions should avoid use of dendrogram and
only point out that significant differences in mortality occurred between treatment with wsv023
dsRNA and the mock-treated groups (PBS and eGFP dsRNA) challenged with WSSV. In addition,
symbols used for each line should be bigger.
Respond: Done accordingly. Please see Fig. 2B.
Reviewer 2:
protein and the L. vannamei gamma complex associated protein 2 (LvGCP2) was proved by
co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assay. Knocking down of the wsv023 transcript and
inhibition of the PERK-eIF2a pathway reduced the WSSV copy number and shrimp mortality of
the wssv-infected shrimp. Over-expression of wsv023 in 293T cells and WSSV infection in
shrimp decreased the microtubules formation suggesting that the wsv023 plays a role in
microtubules organization of shrimp cells. While the work provides some information that might
disclose the relationship between WSSV and UPR in shrimp, however, the authors should clarify
the following aspects and mention in the manuscript. Some points are lacked especially point no 1
and 4. More evidences may be needed.
Comments to the Author 1: In the abstract (line 28-29), knocking down of LvATF4 reduced the
label_comment_9
WSSV copy number and shrimp mortality of WSSV infected shrimp suggested that wsv023 is
critical to WSSV infection. What is the link of your result to wsv023? Did the LvATF4
suppression affect the level of wsv023 transcript of the WSSV infected shrimp? Otherwise it’s too
early to conclude like that.
Respond: In a previous study, we finded that WSSV gene wsv023 is a target genes of shrimp
transcription factor LvATF4, and LvATF4 facilitate WSSV infection (Li, Pang et al. 2013).
LvATF4 could upregulates level of wsv023, but not down-regualte it. And the conclusion we made
seems too strong, so the sentence is replaced by “…….. These results suggested that wsv023 may
be critical to WSSV infection but the precise function of wsv023 was still unknown.”, please see
lines 53-54 in the revised manuscript.
Comments to the Author 2: Why do the authors test the tubulin polymerization in 293T cells not
label_comment_10
in insect cells?
Respond: According to the manufacturer, TubulinTracker™ Green reagent (Life Technology,
USA; T34075) provides green fluorescent staining of polymerized tubulins, but not the
unpolymerized tubulins in live mammal cells. We can not determine whether it work in insect
cells, and we can not find corresponding kit that appropriative in insect cells, so we test the tubulin
polymerization in 293T cells.
Comments to the Author 3: To confirm the role of wsv023 in microtubules organization, in the
label_comment_11
opposite way of over expression of wsv023, why don’t the authors determine the tubulin
polymerization when the wsv023 was knocked down.
Respond: For shrimp, there is still no reliable method to over-expressing foreign gene in vivo.
Comments to the Author 4: How do the authors link the PERK-eIF2a pathway to the wsv023?
label_comment_12
Have the authors check the level of wsv023 transcript and the tubulin polymerization after the
PERK-eIF2a pathway was inhibited in the WSSV infected shrimp?
Respond: ATF4 is the key transcription factor of PERK-eIF2a pathway. And in Ltopenaeus
vannamei, ATF4 (LvATF4) has been proved that is involved in the regulation of wsv023 (Li, Pang
et al. 2013). Salubrinal is a selective inhibitor of PERK-eIF2a pathway of shirmp (Xu, Ruan et al.
2014). We are sorry that we could not check the level of wsv023 transcript and the tubulin
polymerization after the PERK-eIF2a pathway was inhibited in the WSSV infected shrimp, for in
vannamei. Thank your for your professional advice, we will test that once the eperimental
conditions are satisfied in future study.
Some specific issues to be considered and corrected.
Specific issues 1: In the result (line 278), no figure 2C.
Respond: In the result (line 278), “figure 2C” has been replaced by “Fig. 2B”.
Specific issues 2: In the result (line 291), the percentage of cumulative mortality is not correspond
with the graph in figure 3C.
Respond: We are sorry to make the mistake, and it has been corrected. Please see sentences “The
cumulative mortalities of the DMSO injection group, Salubrinal injection group, DMSO injection
plus WSSV infection group, and Salubrinal injection plus WSSV infection group at 168 hpi was
16%, 4%, 100%, and 70%, respectively (Fig. 3B).” at lines 301-303 in the revised manuscript.
Specific issues 3: Spelling check throughout the manuscript.
Respond: Done accordingly.

7 “Wsv023 Interacted with Litopenaeus vannamei <U+03B3>-tubulin Complex Associated Proteins 2, and
8 Decreased The Formation of Microtubules” (RSOS-160379). The reviewers’ suggestions and
9 inputs were very helpful in guiding our revision of our manuscript. We have now revised the
10
11 manuscript according to the reviewers’ comments. Please note that there are two comment 37
12 given by Reviewer 1, and we name it as comment 37-1 and comment 37-2. Also, “Reviewer 1”
13 and “Reviewer 2” efers to in the decision letter seems somewath obscure. The followings are
14 detailed responses to the reviewers’ comments, according to our understanding.

17 Reviewer 1:
18 General comments: This manuscript deals with the interaction between Litopenaeus vannamei
19 core protein of <U+03B3>-tubulin small complex (gamma complex associated protein 2 [LvGCP2]) and
20
21 white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) gene wsv023. By co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down
22 assays it was proved that wsv023 interacted with LvGCP2. Silencing wsv023 significantly
23 reduced WSSV copy number in L. vannamei muscle and cumulative mortality of infected shrimp.
24
A similar result was obtained when LvATF4 was silenced. When wsv023 gene was over-expressed
25
26 in 293T cells, microtubule formation was greatly disrupted, showing the function of this gene in
27 virus replication. The manuscript is interesting and it gives insight into the function of a
28 previously unknown viral gene wsv023. The inhibition of WSSV infection using dsRNA against
29
wsv023 or the substance Salubrinal represent potential alternatives to WSSV control. Nonetheless,
30
31 the manuscript requires an overall English review for clarity and authors require answering some
32 doubts on methodology. Other specific comments are given below.

21 cells by real-time PCR are not described. Please include such methods as they are mentioned in
22 section 2.4.
23 Respond: Done accordingly. Please see sentences “Then, real-time RT-PCR assay was performed
24
on a LightCycler 480 System (Roche, Germany) using a reaction volume of 10 mL, which
25
26 comprised 1 mL of cDNA template, 5 mL of 2× SYBR Premix Ex Taq™ II (Takara), and 500 nM
27 of each primer. The optimized thermal cycling parameters were as follows: 95°C for 2 min to
28 activate the polymerase, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 10 s.
29
After performing the cycling protocol, the melting curves were obtained by increasing the
30
31 temperature from 72°C to 95°C (0.5°C/s) to denature the double-stranded DNA. The results were
32 calculated using the 2-<U+2206><U+2206>Ct method after normalization to LvEF-1a (GenBank Accession No.

50 Comment 31: Lines 199 - 204: Please re-write the paragraph. It is unclear how many shrimp were
51 treated with each dsRNA and how many shrimp from each treatment received only PBS or the
52 WSSV dose (104 virus copies).
53 Respond: The paragraph has been rewritten. Please see sentences “In cumulative mortality assay,
54
55 for each treatment, 50×2 shrimps were intramuscularly injected with 6 µg (50 µL in volume) of
56 dswsv023, dseGFP, or PBS, respectively. 48 h later, 50 shrimps of each treatment injected with 50
57 µL of PBS (negative controls), and another 50 shrimps were injected with tissue homogenate

11 number of shrimp treated with each type of dsRNA for viral load calculation.
12 Respond: Done accordingly. And sentences “To determine WSSV copy number, at each time
13 point (a total of four time points), muscles of five shirmps were collected and pooled as one
14 sample. And there are three parallels for each time point.” has addedd to the revised manuscript to
15
16 made the description more exhaustive, please see lines 220-223. In fact, for each treatment, 60
17 shrimps are sufficient. And for WSSV can cause shrimps death durin the experiment, to ensure the
18 successful completion of the experiment, 80 shrimps are used for each treatment.
19
20
21 Comment 33: Why authors used muscle to measure WSSV viral load? It would have been
22 interesting to know the viral load in other WSSV target organs such as gill or hemolymph.
23 Respond: Shrimp muscle is the concentrated tissue for mature WSSV, with the higest WSSV viral
24
load among shrimp tissues. So shrimp muscle alaway used standard tissue for WSSV viral load
25
26 detection in such study. Gill is not suitbale for WSSV viral load detection, for it susceptible to
27 water environmental, for example, shrimp gill may infect with miniature zooparasite, which also
28 host of WSSV. WSSV viral load in hemolymph uually relatively low, and easy to cause
29
measurement error.

4 Comment 53: Lines 367 – 379. It is proposed to reduce this paragraph to the main points:
5
6 (1) Talk about WSSV macromolecule transportation or morphology changes and need of cell
7 cytoskeleton and lack of direct experimental evidence;
8 (2) Studies that show interaction between WSSV infection and upregulation of expression of
9 tubulin a-1 chain, tubulin ß-1 chain, and microtubule-actin cross-linking factor 1, hence showing
10
11 the relationship between WSSV infection and changes in microtubule organization [14-16]
12 (3) Discuss results obtained from flow cytometry assay and silencing of wsv023 on microtubule
13 synthesis and reduction of WSSV infection/virus copy number.
14
15 Respond: Done accordingly. Please see sentences “Previous reports have suggested that WSSV
16 macromolecule transportation or morphological changes utilize the cytoskeletal framework of host
17
cells. For example, studies have shown that WSSV infection upregulates the expression of tubulin
18
19 a-1 chain, tubulin ß-1 chain, and microtubule-actin cross-linking factor 1, which is indicative of
20 the relationship of WSSV infection and microtubule organization [14-16]. However, direct
21 experimental evidence supporting these concepts is warranted. Flow cytometry analysis indicated
22
that WSSV infection inhibits microtubule formation. In addition, knockdown expression of
23
24 wsv023 resulted in a decrease in WSSV copy number in the muscles of WSSV-infected L.
25 vannamei, as well as in its cumulative mortality. These results provide evidences that
26 wsv023-driven modifications in microtubule organization are also essential to WSSV infection.”

46
Supplemental figure 3 in the revised manuscript, for discriminates the supplemental figures from
47
48 the formally adopted figures.
49
50 Comment 57: Figure 2b should be done easier. The captions should avoid use of dendrogram and
51
only point out that significant differences in mortality occurred between treatment with wsv023
52
53 dsRNA and the mock-treated groups (PBS and eGFP dsRNA) challenged with WSSV. In addition,
54 symbols used for each line should be bigger.

3 This manuscript describes characterization of the wsv023’s function. The interaction of this
4 protein and the L. vannamei gamma complex associated protein 2 (LvGCP2) was proved by
5
6 co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assay. Knocking down of the wsv023 transcript and
7 inhibition of the PERK-eIF2a pathway reduced the WSSV copy number and shrimp mortality of
8 the wssv-infected shrimp. Over-expression of wsv023 in 293T cells and WSSV infection in
9 shrimp decreased the microtubules formation suggesting that the wsv023 plays a role in
10
11 microtubules organization of shrimp cells. While the work provides some information that might
12 disclose the relationship between WSSV and UPR in shrimp, however, the authors should clarify
13 the following aspects and mention in the manuscript. Some points are lacked especially point no 1
14 and 4. More evidences may be needed.
15
16
17 Comments to the Author 1: In the abstract (line 28-29), knocking down of LvATF4 reduced the
18 WSSV copy number and shrimp mortality of WSSV infected shrimp suggested that wsv023 is
19 critical to WSSV infection. What is the link of your result to wsv023? Did the LvATF4
20
21 suppression affect the level of wsv023 transcript of the WSSV infected shrimp? Otherwise it’s too
22 early to conclude like that.
23 Respond: In a previous study, we finded that WSSV gene wsv023 is a target genes of shrimp
24
transcription factor LvATF4, and LvATF4 facilitate WSSV infection (Li, Pang et al. 2013).
25
26 LvATF4 could upregulates level of wsv023, but not down-regualte it. And the conclusion we made
27 seems too strong, so the sentence is replaced by “…….. These results suggested that wsv023 may
28 be critical to WSSV infection but the precise function of wsv023 was still unknown.”, please see
29
lines 53-54 in the revised manuscript.
30
31
32 Comments to the Author 2: Why do the authors test the tubulin polymerization in 293T cells not
33 in insect cells?
34
Respond: According to the manufacturer, TubulinTracker™ Green reagent (Life Technology,
35
36 USA; T34075) provides green fluorescent staining of polymerized tubulins, but not the
37 unpolymerized tubulins in live mammal cells. We can not determine whether it work in insect
38 cells, and we can not find corresponding kit that appropriative in insect cells, so we test the tubulin
39
polymerization in 293T cells.
40
41
42 Comments to the Author 3: To confirm the role of wsv023 in microtubules organization, in the
43 opposite way of over expression of wsv023, why don’t the authors determine the tubulin
44
polymerization when the wsv023 was knocked down.
45
46 Respond: For shrimp, there is still no reliable method to over-expressing foreign gene in vivo.
47
48 Comments to the Author 4: How do the authors link the PERK-eIF2a pathway to the wsv023?
49
50 Have the authors check the level of wsv023 transcript and the tubulin polymerization after the
51 PERK-eIF2a pathway was inhibited in the WSSV infected shrimp?
52 Respond: ATF4 is the key transcription factor of PERK-eIF2a pathway. And in Ltopenaeus
53 vannamei, ATF4 (LvATF4) has been proved that is involved in the regulation of wsv023 (Li, Pang
54
55 et al. 2013). Salubrinal is a selective inhibitor of PERK-eIF2a pathway of shirmp (Xu, Ruan et al.
56 2014). We are sorry that we could not check the level of wsv023 transcript and the tubulin
57 polymerization after the PERK-eIF2a pathway was inhibited in the WSSV infected shrimp, for in

8 Some specific issues to be considered and corrected.
9 Specific issues 1: In the result (line 278), no figure 2C.

17 cumulative mortalities of the DMSO injection group, Salubrinal injection group, DMSO injection
18 plus WSSV infection group, and Salubrinal injection plus WSSV infection group at 168 hpi was
19 16%, 4%, 100%, and 70%, respectively (Fig. 3B).” at lines 301-303 in the revised manuscript.

25 Abstract: Unfolded protein response (UPR) in Litopenaeus vannamei not only plays a
4
5
6 26 role in ER-stress remission, but is also important for white spot syndrome virus (WSSV)
7
8 27 infection. It was proved that the basic region leucine zipper domain (BRLZ) transcription
9
10
11
28 factor of UPR is involved in WSSV gene regulation in L. vannamei. For example, the
12
13 29 expression of wsv023 is regulated by L. vannamei activating transcription factor 4, which
14
15 30 is a BRLZ transcription factor of the PERK-eIF2a pathway. However, the relationship
16
17
18 31 between WSSV and UPR has remained unclear. In the present study, we show that
19
20 32 wsv023 interacts with L. vannamei gamma complex-associated protein 2 (LvGCP2),
21
22 33 which is the core protein of the <U+03B3>-tubulin small complex, and plays a pivotal role in
23
24
25 34 microtubule assembly. Down-regulation of wsv023 expression or inhibition of the
26
27 35 PERK-eIF2a pathway by Salubrinal, significantly reduced WSSV copy number in L.
28
29
36 vannamei muscle, and the cumulative mortality of WSSV infected-shrimp. Furthermore,
30
31
32 37 over-expression of wsv023 in 293T cells could disrupt the formation of microtubules. A
33
34 38 similar result was obtained in shrimp hemocytes that were infected with WSSV.
35
36
37 39 Therefore, wsv023 contributes to microtubule modifications in host cells during WSSV
38

6 49 A previous study found the key transcription factor of Litopenaeus vannamei
7
8
9 50 PERK-eIF2a pathway cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor 4 (LvATF4) was
10
11 51 involved in the transcriptional regulation of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) gene
12
13
52 wsv023. Knocked-down expression of LvATF4 reduced the viral copy number and the
14
15
16 53 cumulative mortality of WSSV infected shrimp. These results suggested that wsv023 may
17
18 54 be critical to WSSV infection but the precise function of wsv023 was still unknown. By
19
20
21
55 using co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays, we show that wsv023 interacts with
22
23 56 L. vannamei gamma complex-associated protein 2 (LvGCP2), which is the core protein of
24
25 57 the <U+03B3>-tubulin small complex. Knocked-down the wsv023 gene significantly reduced the
26
27
28 58 copy number of WSSV in L. vannamei muscle, as well as the cumulative mortality of
29
30 59 infected shrimp. And PERK-eIF2a pathway inhibition also showed reduced virus copy
31
32 60 number and abrogated shrimp mortality. Furthermore, over-expression of wsv023
33
34
35 61 inhibited the formation of microtubules in 293T cells. Flow cytometry revealed that
36
37 62 WSSV infection similarly decreased the formation of microtubules in L. vannamei
38
39
63 hemocytes. These findings suggested that wsv023 plays a role in microtubule
40
41
42 64 organization in host cells, which in turn may be beneficial to WSSV.

71 1. Introduction
4
5
6 72 Microtubules are essential components of the cytoskeleton that confers shape and
7
8
9 73 function in eukaryotic cells. It also plays a vital role in intracellular material
10
11 74 transportation, organelle positioning, cell movement, signal transduction and cell division
12
13
75 [1]. Microtubules should be deally assembled using a special mode that is convenient for
14
15
16 76 rapid reorganization and decomposition [2]. Research studies have shown that
17
18 77 microtubules are formed by the arrangement of 13 parallel protofilaments that arise from
19
20
21
78 the end-to-end aggregation of the a/ß tubulin-dimers [3]. Microtubules are associated
22
23 79 with various other proteins, such as dynein and kinesin, which are involved in the
24
25 80 organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton [4].
26
27
28 81 Cells have specialized nucleation sites that are found in microtubule-organizing centers
29
30
31
82 (MTOCs) [5]. All MTOCs contain <U+03B3>-tubulin, which is homologous to a-tubulin and
32
33 83 ß-tubulin and is required for microtubule nucleation [6]. <U+03B3>-tubulin is prevalent through
34
35 84 out the eukaryotes and is essential for normal microtubule organization in every organism.
36
37
38 85 However, <U+03B3>-tubulin is involved in nucleation of cells in non-MTOC sites, such as plant
39
40 86 cells, which lack centrosome-like structures [7]. Thus, <U+03B3>-tubulin seems to be critical to
41
42
43 87 the initiation of new microtubules in vivo. <U+03B3>-tubulin is part of a large complex consisting
44
45 88 of several proteins, such as <U+03B3>-tubulin, which is purified from Drosophila melanogaster
46
47
48 89 embryos or Xenopus laevis eggs. This complex contains <U+03B3>-tubulin complex protein 2
49
50 90 (GCP2), GCP3, GCP4, GCP5, GCP6, and the neural precursor cell expressed
51
52 91 developmentally down-regulated protein 1 (NEDD1) that form a <U+03B3>-tubulin ring (<U+03B3>-TuRC).
53
54
55 92 In <U+03B3>-TuRC, <U+03B3>-tubulin interacts with GCP2 and GCP3 and yields a stable 300 kDa
56
57 93 subcomplex, called <U+03B3>-tubulin smallcomplex (<U+03B3>-TuSC) [8]. The assembly state of the

3
94 <U+03B3>-tubulin complex is important for its activity, and purified <U+03B3>-TuSC has much lower
4
5
6 95 microtubule-nucleating activity than intact <U+03B3>-TuRC [3].
7
8
9 96 A previous investigation has determined that viral infections might influence
10
11 97 microtubule organization in host cells. In the neuroblastoma cell line IMR32, a
12
13
98 microtubule network was utilized as the transport system of a virus replication site and is
14
15
16 99 involved in the release of mature Japanese encephalitis viruses [9]. A 60% decrease in
17
18 100 particulate tubulin synthesis was reported in SV403T3 cells after transformation by SV40
19
20
21
101 virus compared to that in normal cells [10]. The matrix protein of the vesicular stomatitis
22
23 102 virus interacted with tubulin in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that a cytopathic effect was
24
25 103 caused by these interactions [11]. HSV-1 infection disperses the locations of miniaturized
26
27
28 104 MTs in the cytoplasm, which in turn facilitates HSV-1 capsid migration to the site of
29
30 105 envelopment after exiting the nucleus, thereby promoting efficient viral spread [12].
31
32
33 106 White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is a rapidly replicating and extremely virulent
34
35 107 shrimp pathogen, that causes huge economic losses in shrimp aquaculture. Some studies
36
37
38 108 have indicated that cytoskeleton modulation in shrimp cells might be linked to WSSV
39
40 109 infection-driven microtubule modifications [13-16]. However, the relationship between
41
42 110 WSSV infection and host cell microtubule remains unclear. The present study proved that
43
44
45 111 WSSV gene wsv023 interacted with L. vannamei GCP2 (LvGCP2), the core member of
46
47 112 <U+03B3>-TuSC. Over-expression of wsv023 in 293T cells inhibited the formation of
48
49
113 microtubules. Silencing expression of wsv023 significantly reduced the copy number
50
51
52 114 copy number of WSSV in L. vannamei muscle and the cumulative mortality of
53
54 115 WSSV-infected shrimp. These results suggest that WSSV possibly affects microtubule
55
56
57
116 organization in the host cells via wsv023, thereby enhancing the infection process.

9 119 Expression vectors for full-length LvGCP2, eGFP with Flag-tag or wsv023, and GST
10
11 120 with V5-tag were constructed for co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays. Briefly,
12
13
121 Drosophila S2 cells were co-transfected with the expression plasmid pairs LvGCP2 (Flag)
14
15
16 122 / wsv023 (V5), LvGCP2 (Flag) / GST(V5), and eGFP (Flag) / wsv023 (V5). Cells were
17
18 123 harvested at 48 h post-transfection. S2 cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (Beyotime,
19
20
21
124 China) on ice with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Germany) and
22
23 125 then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-V5 or anti-Flag antibodies (Invitrogen, USA).
24
25 126 The proteins were immunoprecipitated with Protein G Plus/protein A Agarose
26
27
28 127 (Calbiochem, Germany). After incubation, the beads were washed three times with NP-40
29
30 128 lysis buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose
31
32 129 membranes. Then western blot analyses were then performed. The blots were incubated
33
34
35 130 for 2 h at RT in blocking buffer (TBST with 5% BSA) and then for 1.5 h at RT with the
36
37 131 anti-Flag or anti-V5 antibody. After washing three times with TBST, the membranes were
38
39
132 incubated in TBST with 1 / 20,000 horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat

32
33 152 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Multiple sequence alignment was performed
34
35 153 using the ClustalW program. Using MEGA 6.0 software, a neighbor-joining (NJ)
36
37
38 154 phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the deduced amino acid sequences of
39
40 155 LvGCP2 and other known GCP2 proteins. Bootstrap sampling was performed 10,000
41
42 156 times. Protein domains were predicted using the SMART program

163 staining solution (250 nM) was applied to cover the cells and then incubated for 30 min at
4
5
6 164 37°C. After incubation, the staining solution was removed, and the cells were rinsed three
7
8 165 times in a buffer at 37 °C. Then the cells were gently resuspended with Hank’s Balanced
9
10
11
166 Salt Solution (HBSS) gentlely. Approximately 5 × 105 cells were applied to flow
12
13 167 cytometry assay by BD accuri system (BD Biosciences, USA), and the fluorescence
14
15 168 value of the cells were autokinetic calculated by BD accuri C6. Total RNAs and proteins
16
17
18 169 of 293T cells from different groups were extracted, and the expression of Homo sapiens
19
20 170 a-tubulin, ß-tubulin, and ß-actin was detected by real-time RT-PCR and western blot. In
21
22 171 the WSSV infection assay, hemocytes were collected from five shrimps in the PBS
23
24
25 172 injection group and the WSSV infection group at 72 h after treatment; the hemocytes
26
27 173 were pooled together as one sample (n = 3). L. vannamei hemocytes were prepared as
28

32 175 2.5 Synthesis of double-stranded RNA
33
34
35 176 The DNA templates of the wsv023 gene for dsRNA (dswsv023) synthesis were
36
37
38 177 prepared via PCR using the primer pairs DsRNA-wsv023-T7-F/DsRNA-wsv023-R and
39
40 178 DsRNA-wsv023-F/DsRNA-wsv023-T7-R (Table 1). The DNA template for ssRNA
41
42 179 synthesis consisted of annealed DNA oligonucleotides containing a T7 RNA polymerase
43
44
45 180 promoter. For sense ssRNA synthesis, a DNA template containing a T7 RNA polymerase
46
47 181 promoter at its 5'-end was employed, so the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence was
48
49
182 added to 5'-end of the forward primer. For antisense ssRNA synthesis, the DNA template
50
51
52 183 contained a T7 RNA polymerase promoter at its 3'-end, so a T7 RNA polymerase
53
54 184 promoter sequence was added to the 5'-end of the reverse primer. The products with the
55
56
57
185 T7 promoter were confirmed by sequencing, and then subjected to in vitro transcription

7
8 188 prepared via PCR using the primer pairs DsRNA-eGFP-T7-F/DsRNA-eGFP-R and
9
10
11
189 DsRNA-eGFP-F/DsRNA-eGFP-T7-R (Table 1). The lengths of dswsv023 and dseGFP
12
13 190 were 469 bp and 504 bp, respectively.

15
16 191 2.6 WSSV challenge and preparation of templates for real-time RT-PCR analysis
17
18
19 192 To investigate the expression profiles of Lva-tubulin, Lvß-tubulin, and Lv<U+03B3>-tubulin in
20
21 193 WSSV-infected shrimp, WSSV challenge was performed. Each healthy L. vannamei was
22
23 194 injected intramuscularly at the second abdominal segment with 50 µL of a WSSV
24
25
26 195 inoculum, which contained approximately 104 virions. Total RNA from the hemocytes
27
28 196 was isolated at 0, 3, 6, 9,12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 72, and 96 h post inoculation (hpi). From
29
30
31
197 each sample, total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and
32
33 198 then reverse transcribed into cDNA by using PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa,
34
35 199 Japan). Then, real-time RT-PCR assay was performed on a LightCycler 480 System
36
37
38 200 (Roche, Germany) using a reaction volume of 10 mL, which comprised 1 mL of cDNA
39
40 201 template, 5 mL of 2× SYBR Premix Ex Taq™ II (Takara), and 500 nM of each primer.
41
42 202 The optimized thermal cycling parameters were as follows: 95°C for 2 min to activate the
43
44
45 203 polymerase, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 10 s.
46
47 204 After performing the cycling protocol, the melting curves were obtained by increasing the
48
49
205 temperature from 72°C to 95°C (0.5°C/s) to denature the double-stranded DNA. The
50
51
52 206 results were calculated using the 2-<U+2206><U+2206>Ct method after normalization to LvEF-1a (GenBank
53
54 207 Accession No. GU136229) [18]. The primer sequences are presented in Table 1.

209 Approximately 6 g of L. vannamei was obtained from the south base of a marine
4
5
6 210 culture seed project (Zhanjiang, China) and screened for WSSV by PCR using
7
8 211 WSSV-specific primers (5’-TCGCCATCACTGCTGTGATTGC-3’ and
9
10
11
212 5’-CTTTGGCACCATC-TGCATACC-3’). In cumulative mortality assay, for each
12
13 213 treatment, 50×2 shrimps were intramuscularly injected with 6 µg (50 µL in volume) of
14
15 214 dswsv023, dseGFP, or PBS, respectively. 48 h later, 50 shrimps of each treatment injected
16
17
18 215 with 50 µL of PBS (negative controls), and another 50 shrimps were injected with tissue
19
20 216 homogenate containing 104 virions (50 µL in volume) that was prepared from WSSV
21
22 217 infected shrimp following a published protocol [19]. The experiment was repeated three
23
24
25 218 times. All shrimps were kept in culture tanks for approximately 7 days following
26
27 219 infection. Cumulative mortality was recorded every 12 h.
28
29
30 220 To determine WSSV copy number, at each time point (a total of four time points), the
31
32 221 muscles of five shrimps were collected and pooled into one sample. Furthermore, three
33
34
35 222 parallels were prepared for each time point. Then WSSV copy number was determine by
36
37 223 real-time RT-PCR.
38
39
40 224 At 48 h after dseGFP or dswsv023 injection, a subsequent injection of tissue
41
42 225 homogenate was performed to examine the RNAi efficiency of wsv023, and shrimps were
43
44
45 226 sacrificed on the 3rd day after WSSV injection. Total RNA that was extracted from the
46
47 227 hemocytes was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit
48
49
228 (TaKaRa) and then subsequently used as templates. LvEF1a was used as the internal
50
51
52 229 reference. The primer sequences used in this assay are listed in Table 1.

232 cells. In a previous study, we showed that wsv023 is upregulated by PERK-eIF2a
4
5
6 233 pathway in L. vannamei [20]. In the present study, shrimps (n = 100) were injected with
7
8 234 salubrinal (20 µM) or 0.1% DMSO. One hour later, 50 shrimps were injected with tissue
9
10
11
235 homogenate containing 1 × 104 virions (50 µL in volume) for each treatment, and 50
12
13 236 shrimps were injected with PBS. Cumulative mortality was recorded every 12 h. For the
14
15 237 western blot assay and WSSV virion detection, an additional 120 shrimps were prepared
16
17
18 238 with salubrinal (20 µM) or 0.1% DMSO injection plus WSSV infection.
19
20
21
239 All of the shrimps used in this study were obtained from the South base of the marine
22
23 240 culture seed project (Zhanjiang, China). These animals were specifically raised for
24
25 241 research purposes and China does not require any additional permit or permission.
26
27
28 242 Because the experimental animals were invertebrates, no specific permits were required
29
30 243 for this study; and there is no official recommendation for the use of shrimp for scientific
31
32 244 purposes in China. Nevertheless, all of our experimental procedures, including animal
33
34
35 245 sacrifice, were designed to be as humane as possible, and all animals were treated so as to
36
37 246 minimize suffering at all times.

41
42 248 3.1 Wsv023 interaction with LvGCP2
43
44
45 249 In our previous study, tandem affinity purification was performed which indicated that
46
47
48 250 wsv023 likely interacted with LvGCP2. To verify whether wsv023 formed a complex
49
50 251 with LvGCP2 in L. vannamei, co-IP and pull-down assays were conducted. The Wsv023
51
52 252 (V5) and LvGCP2 (Flag) proteins were co-expressed in S2 cells for the co-IP, which
53
54
55 253 showed that wsv023 (V5) co-precipitated with LvGCP2 (Flag) [Fig. 1A(a)]. LvGCP2
56
57 254 (Flag) also co-precipitated with wsv023 (V5) [Fig. 1A(b)]. Furthermore, the MBP

6 256 6×His-eGFP (V5) (Fig. 1B). In addition, MBP alone did not interact with wsv023 (Fig.
7
8 257 1B). These findings thus indicated that wsv023 interacted with LvGCP2.

11 258 3.2 Characterization of LvGCP2 and wsv023
12
13
14 259 The full-length cDNA of LvGCP2 was 3,155 bp in size, which included an 88-bp
15
16 260 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and a 526-bp 3'-UTR with a poly(A) tail (Supplemental
17
18
19 261 Fig.1). The open reading frame (ORF) of LvGCP2 was 2,541 bp in size, which encodes a
20
21 262 putative protein of 846 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 97 kDa.
22
23 263 Conserved domain analysis using the SMART program showed that LvGCP2 contained a
24
25
26 264 Spc97_Spc98 domain that apparently mainly consist of proteins that functioned in
27
28 265 microtubule cytoskeleton organization. Multiple sequence alignment showed that the
29
30
31
266 GCP2 proteins were conserved in all species tested (Supplemental Fig.2). Furthermore,
32
33 267 LvGCP2 showed a higher identity with vertebrate GCP2s than most of the invertebrate
34
35 268 GCP2 proteins except for ZnGCP2; this result coincided with the results of phylogenetic
36
37
38 269 analysis (Supplemental Fig.1).
39
40
270 Wsv023 did not show any conserved domain as analyzed by SMART
41
42
43 271 (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/), whereas BLAST analysis
44
45 272 (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) revealed that wsv023 has similarities with GCP3s.
46
47
48 273 Multiple sequence comparisons indicated that wsv023 had 20.6% and 16.0% identities
49
50 274 with HsGCP3 and LvGCP3, respectively (Fig. S3). Considering the amino acids with
51
52 275 similar properties, wsv023 showed 35.2% and 31.3% identity with HsGCP3 and LvGCP3,
53
54
55 276 respectively (Fig. S3).

9 280 expression in L. vannamei hemocytes as showing by RT-PCR assay [Fig. 2A(a)].The
10
11 281 shrimps treated with dswsv023 had low cumulative mortality 72 h post WSSV infection.
12
13
282 Shrimps treated with dswsv023 and challenged with WSSV had a cumulative mortality of
14
15
16 283 60% at 168 hpi. In contrast, groups mock treated with dseGFP or PBS had cumulative
17
18 284 mortalities of 92% and 100% at 168 hpi, respectively [Fig. 2A(b)].
19
20
21 285 The copy number of WSSV in the wsv023 gene knocked-down groups was examined
22
23 286 at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after WSSV challenging (Supplemental Table1). At 12 hpi, the
24
25
26 287 copy number of WSSV in L. vannamei muscles showed no significant differences
27
28 288 between the wsv023 knocked-down groups and the control groups (Fig. 2B). At 24 hpi,
29
30
31
289 the copy number of wsv023 knocked-down groups showed significantly lower copy
32
33 290 numbers than that in the PBS injection groups, except for the dseGFP injection group. At
34
35 291 48 and 72 hpi, wsv023 knocked-down groups had significantly lower copy numbers of
36
37
38 292 WSSV than the control groups (Fig. 2B). At 72 hpi, the copy number of WSSV in the
39
40 293 PBS injection group was about 10-fold higher than that of the wsv023 knocked-down
41
42 294 group.
43

45 295 3.4 PERK-eIF2a pathway inhibition decreased WSSV infection in shrimps
46
47
48 296 Western blot assay showed that 48 h after Salubrinal injection, phosphorylation of
49
50
297 eIF2a was reduced in hemocytes of L. vannamei (Fig. 3A). At 24, 48, and 72 hpi, the
51
52
53 298 WSSV copy number in L. vannamei muscle of the Salubrinal treatment group was
54
55 299 significantly lower than that of the respective control groups (Fig. 3C). The shrimps
56
57
58
300 treated with Salubrinal also had lower cumulative mortality than the control groups (Fig.

11 304 3.5 Wsv023 inhibited tubulin polymerization in 293T cells
12
13
14 305 TubulinTracker™ Green reagent (T34075) provides green fluorescent staining of
15
16 306 polymerized tubulins, but not the unpolymerized tubulins in live cells. Wsv023 was
17
18
19 307 over-expressed in 293T cells to investigate the function of wsv023. Flow cytometry
20
21 308 analysis showed that wsv023 significantly decreased the average fluorescence values of
22
23 309 the 293T cells, which was 20% less than that of the wsv220N250 expression groups (Fig.
24
25
26 310 4A). Western blot analysis showed that wsv023 did not affect the expression of a-tubulin
27
28 311 and ß-tubulin (Fig. 4B). Thus, the reduction in tubulin polymerization in 293T cells that
29
30
31
312 overexpressed wsv023 was not influenced by the supply of a/ß-tubulin. Given that
32
33 313 <U+03B3>-TuSC is critical for initiating all new microtubules [3], the present results suggested that
34
35 314 wsv023 interacted with LvGCP2, and might therefore influence microtubule formation.
36
37
38 315 3.6 WSSV infection upregulates Lva-tubulin and Lvß-tubulin and inhibits
39
40
41
316 microtubule formation
42
43 317 cDNA microarray analysis indicated that WSSV infection affects the expression of
44
45
46 318 several genes that are relevant to microtubule formation [21]. Lva-tubulin, Lvß-tubulin,
47
48 319 and Lv<U+03B3>-tubulin are primary components of L. vannamei microtubules. In the present
49
50
320 study, RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of Lva-tubulin [Fig.5A(a)] and
51
52
53 321 Lvß-tubulin [Fig.5A(b)] in the hemocytes was upregulated after WSSV injection, whereas
54
55 322 that of Lv<U+03B3>-Tubulin [Fig.5A(c)] was not. The relative expression levels of Lva-Tubulin
56
57
58
323 and Lvß-Tubulin reached peak values at 24 and 30 hpi and were approximately 1.5- and
59

3
324 1.3-fold that of the control, respectively. Flow cytometry assay indicated that WSSV
4
5
6 325 infection significantly reduced microtubule formation in shrimp L. vannamei hemocytes
7
8 326 by about 16% at 72 hpi (Fig. 5B).
9
10
11 327 4. Discussion
12
13
14 328 Growing evidence indicates that WSSV infection modifies microtubule organization in
15
16 329 host cells, although additional research confirming. Blast analysis showed that wsv023
17
18
19 330 was similar to the GCP3 sequence of species, such as Homo sapiens. Other assays (Co-IP
20
21 331 and pull-down) proved that wsv023 could interact with the core protein GCP2 of <U+03B3>-TuSC
22
23 332 in L. vannamei. Further, silencing wsv023 reduced WSSV copy number in muscle and
24
25
26 333 cumulative mortality of WSSV-infected shrimps. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis
27
28 334 revealed that wsv023 might play a role in inhibiting microtubule formation in host cells.
29
30
31
335 These results indicate that wsv023 influences microtubule synthesis and organization in
32
33 336 WSSV-infected cells in shrimp.
34
35
36 337 A total of 684, 531, and 507 putative ORFs have been identi<U+FB01>ed on the
37
38 338 WSSV-Th,WSSV-Cn, and WSSV-Tn isolated genome, respectively [13, 22]. Most of
39
40
339 these ORFs encoded polypeptides that noticeably lacked sequence homology to known
41
42
43 340 proteins. This limitation made it difficult for us to establish the functions of the WSSV
44
45 341 proteins. As reported, wsv023 was expressed at the early stage of WSSV infection,
46
47
48 342 suggesting that it might be indispensable for WSSV [23]. In our previous study, wsv023
49
50 343 was found to be upregulated by activating transcription factor 4, which is the basic region
51
52 344 leucine zipper domain of the transcription factor of L. vannamei unfolded protein
53
54
55 345 response [20], whereas its role in WSSV infection was still unclear. The wsv023 sequence
56
57 346 was found to be similar to the N-terminal end of GCP3, which had 35.2% identity to
58
59
60

Page 27 of 42 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3
347 HsGCP3 and 31.3% identity to LvGCP3. Surprisingly, wsv023 had higher identity with
4
5
6 348 HsGCP3 than LvGCP3, and LvGCP2 had higher identity with mammal GCP2s than most
7
8 349 insect GCP2s, except for ZnGCP2. These evidences suggest that wsv023 might be related
9
10
11
350 to L. vannamei <U+03B3>-TuSC.
12
13
351 GCP3 interacted with GCP2 through its N-terminal, interacted with <U+03B3>-tubulins through
14
15
16 352 its C-terminal, and formed the <U+03B3>-TuSC, which is involved in microtubule growth
17
18 353 initialization [24]. For some viruses, microtubules play a critical role in their infection,
19
20
21
354 such as viral genome transport and envelope assembly; for other viruses, microtubules
22
23 355 contribute to the immunologic process of host cells, such as phagocytosis vesicle
24
25 356 transport, and microtubule formation should be depressed to support virus infection
26
27
28 357 [25-27]. Thus, viruses develop distinct strategies to modify the microtubule organization
29
30 358 of host cells to ensure successful infection. The most common strategy is to interact with
31
32 359 a microtubule or its relevant complexes. Elongation protein zeta 1 promotes neurite
33
34
35 360 extension through its interaction with microtubules; agnoprotein facilitates human
36
37 361 polyomavirus JC virus propagation by inducing the dissociation of FEZ1 from
38
39
362 microtubules [28]. Reovirus core protein µ2 determines the filamentous morphology of
40
41
42 363 viral inclusion bodies by interacting with and stabilizing microtubules [29]. Furthermore,
43
44 364 vaccinia virus proteins A10L and L4R with MAP-like properties mediate the direct
45
46
47
365 binding of viral cores to microtubules and disrupt microtubule organization and
48
49 366 centrosome function [30]. In the present study, we demonstrated that the WSSV protein
50
51 367 wsv023 interacts with LvGCP2, thereby indicating that it might influence microtubule
52
53
54 368 formation in L. vannamei cells.
55
56
57
369 GCP2, GCP3, and two copies of <U+03B3>-tubulins form <U+03B3>-TuSC, which possess

2
3
370 microtubule-nucleating activity and plays an important role in microtubule initiation [3].
4
5
6 371 Depletion of either GCP2 or GCP3 from D. melanogaster S2 cells eliminates the
7
8 372 localization of <U+03B3>-tubulin at the centrosomes and spindles; this elimination results in gross
9
10
11 373 abnormalities in microtubule organization [31, 32]. The formation of microtubules was
12
13 374 inhibited by the over-expression of wsv023 in 293T cells, which suggests that the
14
15
16 375 interaction between wsv023 and GCP2 could decrease microtubule-nucleating activity.
17
18 376 The wsv023 product is similar to the N-terminal part of GCP3, which interacts with
19
20 377 <U+03B3>-tubulin at its C-terminal end. The wsv023-GCP2 complex prevented the formation of
21
22
23 378 functional <U+03B3>-TuSC but the effect of this interaction needs further investigation.
24
25
26
379 Previous reports have suggested that WSSV macromolecule transportation or
27
28 380 morphological changes utilize the cytoskeletal framework of host cells. For example,
29
30 381 studies have shown that WSSV infection upregulates the expression of tubulin a-1 chain,
31
32
33 382 tubulin ß-1 chain, and microtubule-actin cross-linking factor 1, which is indicative of the
34
35 383 relationship of WSSV infection and microtubule organization [14-16]. However, direct
36
37 384 experimental evidence supporting these concepts is warranted. Flow cytometry analysis
38
39
40 385 indicated that WSSV infection inhibits microtubule formation. In addition,
41
42 386 knocked-down expression of wsv023 resulted in a decrease in WSSV copy number in the
43
44
387 muscles of WSSV-infected L. vannamei, as well as in its cumulative mortality. These
45
46
47 388 results provide evidences that wsv023-driven modifications in microtubule organization
48
49 389 are also essential to WSSV infection.
50
51
52 390 In conclusion, the present study indicates that wsv023 interacts with LvGCP2, and
53
54
391 might disturb microtubule formation in shrimp haemocyte, promoting WSSV infection
55
56
57 392 (Fig. 6). Further study will focus on the how WSSV benefited from such microtubules

Dear editors and reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our manuscript entitled
“Wsv023 Interacted with Litopenaeus vannamei <U+03B3>-tubulin Complex Associated Proteins 2, and
Decreased The Formation of Microtubules” (RSOS-160379.R1). The reviewers’ suggestions and
inputs were very helpful in guiding our revision of our manuscript. We have now revised the
manuscript according to the reviewers’ comments. The followings are detailed responses to the
reviewers’ comments, according to our understanding.
Reviewer 1:
General comments: This revised manuscript will be accepted if the authors use the author's
abstract instead of the main abstract.
Respond: Done accordingly.
Reviewer 2:This manuscript deals with the interaction between Litopenaeus vannamei core
protein of <U+03B3>-tubulin small complex (gamma complex associated protein 2 [LvGCP2]) and white
spot syndrome virus (WSSV) gene wsv023. By co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays it
was proved that wsv023 interacted with LvGCP2. Silencing wsv023 significantly reduced WSSV
copy number in L. vannamei muscle and cumulative mortality of infected shrimp. A similar result
was obtained when LvATF4 was silenced. When wsv023 gene was over-expressed in 293T cells,
microtubule formation was greatly disrupted, showing the function of this gene in virus replication.
The manuscript is interesting and it gives insight into the function of a previously unknown viral
gene wsv023. The inhibition of WSSV infection using dsRNA against wsv023 or the substance
Salubrinal represent potential alternatives to WSSV control. After revision, the manuscript has
improved very much. Some minor corrections were done in the pdf file as comments. Some
corrections need to be addressed by the authors as well. Specific comments are given in the pdf
file attached.
Respond: All specific comments given by reviewer 2 in the pdf file attached have been corrected
according to the reviewer’s suggestions (showed in yellow in revised manuscript 2). And present
way of Fig. 1 has been changed to make it easier to understand.
