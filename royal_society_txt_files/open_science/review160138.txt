The revision and the authors responses successfully address most of my comments. While I
continue to experience the method section as cumbersome to read, my remaining concerns boil
down to the specific minor points listed below. Overall, readability of the manuscript would still
benefit from careful editorial changes. Exemplary points are listed as well.
1.
“Integrative approach”
Integrative is in general loosely defined but in most people’s mind means the application of
different research approaches to different levels of a biological phenomenon. For instance the
study of developmental patterning looking at genetic, cellular, chemical, and physical aspects. In
the present study, different functions of Dscam are studied looking at a number of phenotypic
traits. So I would argue this is less an integrative but comprehensive study.

Reply to reviewer #1
The revision and the authors responses successfully address most of my comments. While I
continue to experience the method section as cumbersome to read, my remaining concerns
boil down to the specific minor points listed below. Overall, readability of the manuscript
would still benefit from careful editorial changes. Exemplary points are listed as well.
Thank you for the suggested changes. Please see our detailed responses below. We have also
carefully re-read the manuscript and made a few other minor editorial changes (not itemised
below).
1.“Integrative approach”
ntegrative is in general loosely defined but in most people’s mind means the application of
different research approaches to different levels of a biological phenomenon. For instance the
study of developmental patterning looking at genetic, cellular, chemical, and physical aspects.
n the present study, different functions of Dscam are studied looking at a number of
phenotypic traits. So I would argue this is less an integrative but comprehensive study.
We have replaced 4 instances of “integrative”:
Line 19 now reads: “…we combine different approaches…”
Lines 28-29: “…from different phenotypic perspectives.”
Line 45: “…combined different approaches…”
Line 452: “…taken a multi-pronged approach…”
2. 61 described for T. castaeum (2). typo
Line 63 - This has been corrected.
3. “As host insects we used wild type D. melanogaster and T. castaneum.”
Which exact strains?
This information is described in the supplementary methods. We have rephrased the sentence
collected in Germany and Croatia respectively (please see Supplementary methods for more
details, both here and throughout the methods).”
4. “254 laterial oviduct and…” Typo: lateral
Line 263 - This has been corrected.
5. “253 The role that Dscam1 plays in the immune system of pancrustaceans has been the
subject of a
254 number of studies,... “
Add references
Line 269: We have added “reviewed in Ng et al 2014, Armitage et al 2015 and Armitage &
Brites in press”
6.“316 Dscam1 knockdown and larval T. castaneum survival and development after
317 haemocoelic and oral bacterial exposure.“
Confusing sentence structure
Lines 333-334: This has been rephrased to: “Effect of Dscam1 knockdown on larval T.
castaneum survival and development after haemocoelic or oral bacterial exposure.” We have
also rephrased the corresponding headings for the relevant parts of the materials and methods
and supplementary methods.
7. “197 Life history effects of Dscam1 knockdown in T. castaneum.
198 Effect of Dscam1 knockdown on T. castaneum behaviour: climbing and open arena.”
would replace this with “Behavioral tests”
Line 203: As suggested, we have replaced “Effects of Dscam1…” with “Behavioural tests”.
8.“199 For this and the following section we used the same animals for behavioural and then
ecundity experiments. We injected 11 day old larvae with dsRNA (D-ex12RNAi
200 : n = 144; D-ex15RNAi: n = 144; TCRNAi: n = 192; NRNAi
201”
Nonetheless, I would present this separately
Lines 218-219: We have added the following to the beginning of the fecundity section: “After
he behavioural tests, we used the same dsRNA-injected animals (D-ex12RNAi: n = 144; D-
ex15RNAi: n = 144; TCRNAi: n = 192) to test the effect of Dscam1 knockdown on fecundity.”
9.“Effect of Dscam1 knockdown on T. castaneum fecundity.”
Rephrase into headers of method section paragraphs. In this case: Fecundity testing
Line 217: We have rephrased the header to “Fecundity test.”
10.“220 Effect of Dscam1 knockdown on T. castaneum mating behaviour and physiology.”
Rephrase as: Mating behaviour and physiology tests
Line 228: This has been rephrased to “Mating behaviour and physiology”.
11.“In general the
243 constitutive expression of Dscam1 was low relative to the reference genes, indeed the
only
244 tissue in which Dscam1 expression was higher than the reference genes was in the brain

245 castaneum larvae and adults (Figure S2B).”
mmediately wo consulting the methods section
Lines 251-254: We have rephrased to: “In general, the constitutive expression of Dscam1 was
ow relative to the reference genes (Rp49 and RpL13a). Indeed the only tissue in which
Dscam1 expression was higher than the reference genes was in the brain of T. castaneum
arvae and adults (Figure S2B).”
12.“258 The role that Dscam1 plays in the immune system of pancrustaceans has been the
subject of a
259 number of studies, … “
Add references
We think that this refers to the same sentence as comment #5, therefore please see reply to
comment #5 above.
13.“Here, we
261 tested whether the fat body or haemocytes showed increased Dscam1 transcription in two
262 model hosts, D. melanogaster and T. castaneum, after haemocoelic exposure to bacteria.”
Parts of the sentence read redundant bc D. melanogaster and T. castaneum have been
ntroduced at this point.
Line 272: As suggested, we have removed the names of the model organisms.
14.“...as well as the treatment control (TC), relative to the naïve (N) control groups, and the
269 responses were tissue, time point and bacteria-specific (Figure 1A-D), verifying that all
270 bacteria and wounding alone led to immune activation.”
Some comma issues. Rewrite into: ...as well as the treatment control (TC) relative to the naïve
N) control groups and the responses were tissue, time point, and bacteria-specific (Figure
1A-D), verifying that all
270 bacteria and wounding alone led to immune activation.”
Line 277-280: Changed as suggested.
15.“Although some studies using

15)),
294 therefore we cannot exclude the possibility that transcriptional changes might have
occurred
295 at a later time point, or indeed using a different bacterial dose.”
Break up sentence
Lines 300-305: We have made this into two sentences with a break before ‘Therefore’.
16.“Schwarz and Evans (11) pointed out that differences in Dscam1 expression in
313 their study might vary as a result of contamination by haemocytes, fat body and nervous
314 tissue in the sampled gut and abdomen (11), however it might be interesting to note that

of
316 TcDscam1 at six or eighteen hours after oral exposure to Btt.”
Break up sentence
17. “to
322 E.c., one”
E. coli? I am not familiar with the immunobiology literature but would prefer to have
bacterial names abbreviated like other species names for quicker orientation and reduced
effort of keeping track of special abbreviations.
Throughout the manuscript, figures, and supplements we have changed bacterial
abbreviations from Btt, Ec and Pf to B. thuringiensis, E. coli and P. fluorescens.
18.“323 Dscam1 knockdown and larval T. castaneum survival and development after
324 haemocoelic and oral bacterial exposure.”
Rephrase into:
Effect of Dscam1 knockdown on larval T. castaneum survival and development after
haemocoelic and oral bacterial exposure”
We have changed this as suggested. Please see reply to comment #6.
19.“.., the Btt larvae ‘
B. thuringiensis infected larvae?
Line 347: Changed to “the B. thuringiensis-infected larvae”.
20. “...we do not know the half-life of the Dscam1 protein, perhaps it is still
354 present in sufficient quantities to be functional four days after the knockdown or the
355 knockdown might not have been strong enough to detect immune-phenotypes (however
see
356 results for behaviour below).”
Break up sentence
Line 364-367: We have inserted a full stop after the first “knockdown”, and have started the
ollowing sentence with “Alternatively,”
21.“The absence of mating most likely explains the lack of
421 larvae resulting from pairings in our previous experiment where the male was a
TcDscam1
422 knockdown (Figure 2B).”
think the “most likely” can be deleted here.
Line 431: We would prefer to err on the side of caution and keep the formulation as “most
ikely” because we did not observe the beetles to see whether they mated in the previous
experiment.
