The manuscript describes a novel non-sequencing approach was developed to detect short DNA
fragments (ca. 100 bp) for rapid authentication of two natural products,Testudinis Carapax ET
Plastrum and Trionycis Carapax, based on the difference in mitochondrial genome. Five
specifically-designed primer reactions were established to target species for reliable identification
of their commercial products. The designed PCR system encompasses several analytical
parameters, including, sensitivity, specificity and LOD. Influence of processing has been analysed
and compared as well. The manuscripts lay out, form and content well suits the RSOS journal.
"Introduction" contains all the necessary information well-ordered in logical sequence. The
paragraphs "Material and Methods" as well as "Results and Discussion" include numbered
paragraphs with clearly described procedures used and achieved results. The reference list is
actual and valuable. The objective of the paper could be of potential interest, so it can be accepted
in its present form.

The current manuscript reported a PCR approach using species-specific primers for screening
Testudinis Carapax ET Plastrum and Trionycis Carapax. The authors have done a lot of work but
the following points need to be stressed before publication:
-Figure 1 is very confusing. The right column is just the standard process for any DNA
determination and is not what is considered a ‘novel’ strategy. The left panel is also not clear

enough. For example, how are the primers designed specifically? What is a self-made sample? In
which step is this primer design
-Quite a few samples are redundant and collected on the same day as in Table 1. Are they just
duplicates of the same sample?
-The procedures in Figure 2 are not detailed enough. The authors should add details such as the
length of processed time, temperature etc.
-Inter and intra assay variation of triplicates should be reported
-Many gel images are very blurry in insufficient resolution. High-res images are needed
-The authors also need to do some quantitative analysis on the amplified DNA from gel images

where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Appendix A
Reviewers' comments and author's responses
1. Figure 1 is very confusing. The right column is just the standard process for any
DNA determination and is not what is considered a ‘novel’ strategy. The left panel is
also not clear enough. For example, how are the primers designed specifically? What
is a self-made sample? In which step is this primer design.
Response:
(1) Figure 1 has been carefully revised according to the advice. As indicated, the
right column is the standard process for DNA determination but not about ‘novel
strategy’, it has been deleted from the figure.
(2) The details of the process of designing primers have been shown in Figure 3
in section 2.3 “Target gene selection and primers design”. In addition, the
interpretation of self-made sample has been listed before Figure 2 in section 2.1
“Materials”.
(3) Primer design was always conducted before the start of the PCR experiment.
When species in the research is selected, the primers can be designed according
to their genomes.
2. Quite a few samples are redundant and collected on the same day as in Table 1. Are
they just duplicates of the same sample?
Response: Thank you for the comment. They are not duplicates of the same
sample. Some of the samples were collected on same day in same city, but they
were obtained from different shops or supermarkets.
3. The procedures in Figure 2 are not detailed enough. The authors should add details
such as the length of processed time, temperature etc.
Response: More details including the length of processed time and temperature
have been added in Figure 2 according to the advice.
4. Inter and intra assay variation of triplicates should be reported
Response: This piece of work was qualitative identification using conventional
PCR assay, which is different from real-time PCR. Inter and intra assay
variation of triplicates should be reported while quantitative analysis using
real-time PCR. However, it is difficult for conventional PCR assay to quantify
accurately from gel images to evaluate inter and intra assay variation. For
instant, inter and intra assay variation were not evaluated according to Specific
PCR assays to determine bovine, porcine, fish and plant origin of gelatin
capsules of dietary supplements (Jae-Hwang Lee, et al. Food Chemistry, 2016)
and DNA barcoding, species-specifc PCR and real-time PCR techniques for the
identifcation of six Tribolium pests of stored products (Tao Zhang, et al.
Scientific Reports, 2016). In addition, according to Validation of analytical
procedures: text and methodology in ICH harmonised tripartite guideline Q2
(R1), Specificity is normally evaluated in identification, the other characteristics
is not normally evaluated (Table).

_R1/Step4/Q2_R1__Guideline.pdf
5. Many gel images are very blurry in insufficient resolution. High-res images are
needed
Response: High-res images have been re-uploaded according to the advice.
6. The authors also need to do some quantitative analysis on the amplified DNA from
gel images
Response: Quantitative analysis can be done by real-time PCR assay based on Ct
value which is in the beginning of exponential growth. It is not affected by the
consumption of the reaction system, such as primers, dNTP, enzyme activity and
so on. However, it is difficult for conventional PCR assay to meet the
requirements of accurate quantification from gel images because of the stage of
the exponential growth of the end of measurement methods and the performance
of the camera. Therefore, only a conventional PCR assay for rapid
authentication of Testudinis Carapax ET Plastrum and Trionycis Carapax has
been performed in this research.
