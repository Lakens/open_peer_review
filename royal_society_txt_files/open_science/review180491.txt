The authors present an interesting and well-done study of non-companion animal responses to
human facial expressions. There has been considerable interest in recent years in understanding
how, if at all, non-human animals process and understand human facial diversity and human
facial expression. This work has focused on companion and work animals though the present
study examines an animal species domesticated for production - the goat.
The study demonstrates a clear (though side-biased) preference for interacting with faces
showing positive emotional valence. The analyses appear to be well done and allow this more
subtle effect to be pulled out.
My minor suggestion for revision is that the authors should state more clearly the possible
hypotheses for why the goats show this ability. Is it because of domestication and selection for
attention to human emotions? Or because these particular goats interact with humans at their
sanctuary in such a way as to favor their learning of facial expressions in a manner that goats in a
traditional goat herd might not. The present data cannot answer this question and this topic is
sort of touched on indirectly in the discussion, but I would recommend the authors to raise the
question directly.
Related to the question of whether or not domestication is needed for animals to attend to human
facial expressions, it would be appropriate, I think, to cite some of the literature on wild animals
that learn human faces (e.g. Cornell et al Proc B 2012, Levey et al PNAS 2009).

This paper reports the interesting finding that goats can discriminate between human facial
expressions. I think this finding is novel and worthy of publication in this journal, but I am not
sure that all the conclusions in the paper are warranted or necessary. In fact I think the paper
could have more impact if it focussed on the main finding. In particular I am not convinced by
the lateralisation interpretation. My reading of the results is that there is a general side bias (goats
interact first and more with the image on the right side), so it seems unsurprising that there is
also a bias towards positive images on the right side, given that they also prefer positive faces. In
my experience side biases can be common in animal experiments and I think we need to treat
them with caution. So, I am not sure that the results as presented can be interpreted in terms of
hemispheric specialisation without further justification, and I think that the authors need to
provide this justification or omit this part. On the whole, however, the paper is well written and
could make a good contribution to the literature. I have a few other minor points:
Minor points:
Full title and short title seem to be about different things, could you change this to make it
consistent?
Abstract
Line 21 – can you be more cautious, facial expressions might be highly informative? And I am not
sure about lumping dogs and horses here who have likely experienced different routes of
domestication (horses more about production, similar to goats?) – see below.
Line 26 – can you make it clear that it is an identical human?
Needs more explanation about the methodological framework – the findings 27-31 don’t follow
that clearly from the basic description of method 24-27. Side bias could be interpreted differently,
so not sure about the strength of this conclusion (as above).
Introduction
Paragraph 2 – this mixes facial identity and facial expression and is a bit confusing, can you
rephrase?
I’m confused about the premise that horses have a similar domestication history to dogs, I am not
an expert on this at all, but would have assumed food production has likely played a role in both
species, but more so in horses (like goats). Can the authors justify their approach and cite more
references? Regardless I don’t think this distinction is necessary for the rationale – it reads a bit
too simply and is rather short. I would expand a bit and avoid making these generalisations
between species. There is a large body of literature on facial expressions in animals that could
also be included here.
Methods and Results
Which side did E1 leave from? I assume this was randomised, but can you confirm?
Line 138 – randomised
Line 147 – combinations
Line 181 – I don’t understand why these 16% of trials with no preference were removed, surely
they still represent an important part of the dataset?
Line 183 –your statistical method seems great as it controls for within subject dependence and

thus avoid pseudoreplication, can you mention this explicitly?

The presented study aims at investigating whether goats behaviourally respond to emotional
valences (positive/happy or negative/angry) of humans. Two images of an unfamiliar human
have been presented simultaneously to the goats and behavioural responses (latency to interact
with image, duration and rate of interactions) were recorded. When positioned on the right side,
goats interacted first, more often and for longer with positive faces, however, no preference was
found when the positive faces were placed on the left side. I recommend the manuscript for peer

The authors have addressed the comments and the paper reads really well. I have two last
comments, however, and I hope the authors find these constructive. First, I feel the paper is
missing discussion of the mechanism at work that equips goats to have the skill - if the authors
don't think it is due to domestication, then why do they have it? I am also not convinced that the
domestication history of goats is that different to horses and dogs. I understand there must have
been more focus on food, but they still would have lived with humans and could have undergone
self-domestication processes etc. Likewise dogs and horses would have also been seen as food
animals in many stretches of history (and currently). I think a softer distinction and more detailed
discussion of this would really improve the manuscript. As I said originally, I don't think the
manuscript needs the rationale of difference between the three species. Otherwise the paper is a
nice to read and makes an important contribution.

'Goats prefer positive human emotional facial expressions', in which they show goats to
preferably interact with images presenting positive human affects compared to negative ones,
especially when presented on the right side. The improved version of the manuscript is also
acknowledged by the reviewer, they only make one valuable suggestion regarding the
comparability of domestication history between goats, dogs and equids, which I would ask the

Appendix A
Dear Dr. Power,
Thank you very much for the thoughtful and constructive comments of you and
the two reviewers on our manuscript “Goats prefer positive human emotional
facial expressions” [RSOS-180491] and for giving us the chance of a
resubmission. We have responded to all comments in the Response letter
section below.
We have edited the manuscript as suggested by the two reviewers. We now
provide more information on why the domestication histories of dogs and horses
are similar to one another working directly with humans, and different to goats
as a production species. Dogs and horses were from early in their domestication
used in cooperative contexts with humans, for example in hunting, guarding, or
riding (L68-74). This is not the case for goats. We also added a more explicit
hypothesis (L89-92) and extended our discussion regarding the question of
whether our findings are the result of the specific human environment of our
study subjects or of other factors, such as domestication (L326-329). Finally, we
lowered our claim regarding the lateralized response of our goats towards the
positive image (alternatively, the general side bias might be actually caused by
their strong stimulus-specific lateralized response). Nonetheless, we want to
highlight that independent of side of presentation, goats preferred to approach
the positive image first.
We hope that the present version of the manuscript has improved significantly
and that you might reconsider this manuscript for publication in Royal Society
Open Science.
The material in this manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not
submitted for publication elsewhere. All authors have seen the final manuscript
and we all take responsibility for its contents.
Yours sincerely,

first, more often and for longer with positive faces, however, no preference was
found when the positive faces were placed on the left side. I recommend the
manuscript for peer review.
Authors’ response: Thank you for your positive feedback!
Reviewer: 1
The authors present an interesting and well-done study of non-companion
animal responses to human facial expressions. There has been considerable
interest in recent years in understanding how, if at all, non-human animals
process and understand human facial diversity and human facial expression.
This work has focused on companion and work animals though the present study
examines an animal species domesticated for production - the goat.
The study demonstrates a clear (though side-biased) preference for interacting
with faces showing positive emotional valence. The analyses appear to be well
done and allow this more subtle effect to be pulled out.
My minor suggestion for revision is that the authors should state more clearly the
possible hypotheses for why the goats show this ability. Is it because of
domestication and selection for attention to human emotions? Or because these
particular goats interact with humans at their sanctuary in such a way as to favor
their learning of facial expressions in a manner that goats in a traditional goat
herd might not. The present data cannot answer this question and this topic is
2
sort of touched on indirectly in the discussion, but I would recommend the
authors to raise the question directly.
Authors’ response: We have edited the paragraph in the discussion
accordingly. We now state in the last sentence that we need to test other
goat populations to answer this question.
Lines 326-329: “These will answer the question of whether a specific
background with humans (e.g. daily positive interactions) is necessary
to enable goats to discriminate human emotional facial expressions or if
goats, independent of their rearing background, are capable of reading
subtle human facial cues.“
Related to the question of whether or not domestication is needed for animals to
attend to human facial expressions, it would be appropriate, I think, to cite some
of the literature on wild animals that learn human faces (e.g. Cornell et al Proc B
2012, Levey et al PNAS 2009).
Authors’ response: Thanks for the reference suggestions. We now
added them in the introduction to clarify that identifying humans might be
widespread, while identifying facial emotional expressions in human
might be more challenging.
Lines 57-61: “Individual discrimination of heterospecifics is present in
non-human animals such as birds [17,18], horses [19] and dogs [20].
However, discriminating facial expressions linked to emotions in
heterospecifics, such as humans, is assumed to be particularly
challenging because emotions are not necessarily expressed in similar
ways across species [4]“

This paper reports the interesting finding that goats can discriminate between
human facial expressions. I think this finding is novel and worthy of publication
in this journal, but I am not sure that all the conclusions in the paper are
warranted or necessary. In fact I think the paper could have more impact if it
focussed on the main finding. In particular I am not convinced by the lateralisation
interpretation. My reading of the results is that there is a general side bias (goats
interact first and more with the image on the right side), so it seems unsurprising
that there is also a bias towards positive images on the right side, given that they
also prefer positive faces. In my experience side biases can be common in
animal experiments and I think we need to treat them with caution. So, I am not
3
sure that the results as presented can be interpreted in terms of hemispheric
specialisation without further justification, and I think that the authors need to
provide this justification or omit this part.
Authors’ response: We agree with the reviewer that side biases are very
common in animal experiments. However, the context-specific
emergence of lateralized behaviour in research on animal emotions is
usually interpreted as an indicator of differential processing of the
emotional treatments (see e.g. Proops et al. 2018). In addition, goats in
our study only showed a strong side bias in the context of positive
images located on the right side. This side preference does not exist
when negative images are attached to the right side. Thus, the general
side bias might be caused by the strong context-specific response when
positive images are attached at the right side.
We edited the abstract and conclusions of our manuscript by deleting
text where we speculate about brain processing lateralization.

On the whole, however, the paper is well written and could make a good
contribution to the literature. I have a few other minor points:
Minor points:
Full title and short title seem to be about different things, could you change this
to make it consistent?
Authors’ response: We have edited the title accordingly. Our long title is
now: “Goats prefer positive human emotional facial expressions”. We did
not change our short title (“Goats prefer happy human faces”)
Abstract
Line 21 – can you be more cautious, facial expressions might be highly
informative?
Authors’ response: We have edited the text accordingly.
Lines 24-25: “Therefore, human facial expressions may be highly
informative for animals domesticated for working closely with people,
such as dogs and horses.“

And I am not sure about lumping dogs and horses here who have likely
experienced different routes of domestication (horses more about production,
similar to goats?) – see below.
Authors’ response: We have edited the title accordingly. We reply to the
reviewer’s concern on comparing dog and horse domestication with
livestock domestication in our comment below.
Line 26 – can you make it clear that it is an identical human?
Authors’ response: We have edited the text accordingly.
Lines 27-30: “In this study, we investigated whether goats can
distinguish human facial expressions when simultaneously shown two
images of an unfamiliar human with different emotional valences
(positive/happy or negative/angry).“
Needs more explanation about the methodological framework – the findings 27-
31 don’t follow that clearly from the basic description of method 24-27. Side bias
could be interpreted differently, so not sure about the strength of this conclusion
(as above).
Authors’ response: We added additional details to the methodological
framework.
Lines 30-33: “Both images were vertically attached to a wall on one side
of a test arena,1.3 m apart, and goats were released from the opposite
side of the arena (distance of 4.0 m) and were free to explore and interact
with the stimuli during the trials. Each of four test trials lasted 30 s.”
Introduction
Paragraph 2 – this mixes facial identity and facial expression and is a bit
confusing, can you rephrase?
Authors’ response: We now have restructured the paragraph and hope
that the message is now conveyed clearer. We now start with primate
facial expressions and their perception and discrimination in
conspecifics. We then proceed to discuss similar mechanisms in non-
primate species.
Lines 51-57: “Humans and non-human primates, possess a rich
repertoire of facial expressions [8], and are capable of discriminating
emotional facial expressions of conspecifics [2,9–11] Although primate
5
musculature facilitates communication through facial cues, non-primate
species that possess less developed facial muscles might also be able
to convey information to others through their faces [5,12,13]. Sheep
(Ovis aries), for example, have shown some sophisticated social skills,
including long-term visual memory of conspecific faces [14,15] and
discrimination of images of conspecifics expressing different emotions
[16].“
I’m confused about the premise that horses have a similar domestication history
to dogs, I am not an expert on this at all, but would have assumed food production
has likely played a role in both species, but more so in horses (like goats). Can
the authors justify their approach and cite more references? Regardless I don’t
think this distinction is necessary for the rationale – it reads a bit too simply and
is rather short. I would expand a bit and avoid making these generalisations
between species. There is a large body of literature on facial expressions in
animals that could also be included here.
Authors’ response: We edited the text accordingly. We have added
additional information and references detailing why the domestication
histories of dogs and horses are more similar to each other, compared
to the domestication of goats. Specifically, dogs and horses were
domesticated to work very closely with humans (e.g. hunting and riding,
respectively), whereas goats were never used for those purposes.
Lines 68-74: “It has been suggested that this ability of processing
heterospecific emotional expressions is a by-product of their close
working relationships with humans during domestication [27]. Although
the domestication history of dogs and horses differs, both were
domesticated to cooperate with human in a variety of contexts, such as
for hunting, guarding, or riding. In these cooperative contexts, the
perception of human emotional facial expressions is likely to have been
adaptive for both species.”
Methods and Results
Which side did E1 leave from? I assume this was randomised, but can you
confirm?
Authors’ response: E1 always left on the left side of the arena (the exit
door is indicated in Figure 1). After E1 has left the arena, she kneeled
and positioned herself at the level of the midline, behind the camera
position. We now refer to the Figure in the text.
Line 138 – randomised
6
Line 147 – combinations
Authors’ response: Thanks for pointing out these typos. We have edited
the text accordingly.
Line 181 – I don’t understand why these 16% of trials with no preference were
removed, surely they still represent an important part of the dataset?
Authors’ response: We apologize for the confusion. The 16 % of trials
refer to the trials in which subjects did not approach the images and thus
did not make any choice at all (i.e. did not gaze at or interact with the
images). These trials were excluded from analysis.
Lines 188-190: “Trials where goats did not make any choice were
excluded from the analyses because they were not informative for the
interpretation of the data (13 trials distributed among 10 individuals,
representing 16.2% of all trials).“
Line 183 –your statistical method seems great as it controls for within subject
dependence and thus avoid pseudoreplication, can you mention this explicitly?
Authors’ response: Thanks for the positive feedback. We have edited the
text accordingly.

Response to editor and reviewers
Associate Editor:
The authors have provided a substantially revised and improved version of the
manuscript 'Goats prefer positive human emotional facial expressions', in which
they show goats to preferably interact with images presenting positive human
affects compared to negative ones, especially when presented on the right side.
The improved version of the manuscript is also acknowledged by the reviewer,
they only make one valuable suggestion regarding the comparability of
domestication history between goats, dogs and equids, which I would ask the
authors to discuss.
Authors’ response: Thank you for the positive feedback!
Reviewer: 2
The authors have addressed the comments and the paper reads really well. I
have two last comments, however, and I hope the authors find these
constructive. First, I feel the paper is missing discussion of the mechanism at
work that equips goats to have the skill - if the authors don't think it is due to
domestication, then why do they have it?
Authors’ response: We thank the reviewer for the positive feedback to
our revised manuscript. Regarding this specific point, we believe that we
already discuss potential alternatives. In addition to the potential role of
domestication (or a specific selection for interspecies communication,
Lines 284-297), we point to the frequent positive interactions our study
subjects have at the sanctuary and the role of experience in developing
this ability (Lines 320-327). We also discuss that the underlying
mechanisms are still to be sought and suggest testing goats without prior
human contact to disentangle this issue (Lines 327-333).
I am also not convinced that the domestication history of goats is that different to
horses and dogs. I understand there must have been more focus on food, but
they still would have lived with humans and could have undergone self-
domestication processes etc. Likewise dogs and horses would have also been
seen as food animals in many stretches of history (and currently). I think a softer
distinction and more detailed discussion of this would really improve the
manuscript. As I said originally, I don't think the manuscript needs the rationale
of difference between the three species. Otherwise the paper is a nice to read
and makes an important contribution.

Authors’ response: We now added that an initial selection for tameness
could have led to a general enhanced human-animal communication in
domestic animals. However, goats, as well as other livestock species,
were never under direct selection for more refined human-animal
cooperative skills necessary for cooperative tasks such as hunting or
riding.
Lines 76-83: “Unlike dogs and horses, goats have been exclusively
domesticated for production of materials used by humans [28,29], with
new findings indicating that early intentional human efforts for selecting
these animals (dating 8000 years) were focused on pigmentation,
stature, reproduction, milking, and response to dietary change [30].
These differences may suggest that domestic goats are less likely to
have been selected for reading subtle communicative cues from
humans. However, an initial selection for tameness and a thus reduced
emotional reactivity might have been sufficient to enhance a general
human-animal communication set of skills in domestic animals [31]. In
agreement with the latter idea, …“
