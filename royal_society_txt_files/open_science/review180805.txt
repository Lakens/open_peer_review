Editor's comments:
The authors have characterised the expression of PDGFRB in goat testis development and other
tissues where it is widely expressed. However, the most interesting finding of this paper is the
identification of a 10bp indel that is strongly associated with first-born litter size. This might have
important utility for selective breeding.
Overall, the analysis and the conclusions are sound. However, the paper is in places difficult to
read, and requires considerable improvement in the quality of the language prior to publication.
The paper will require major revision, that takes account of this point and also the comments of
the reviewer.

Appendix A
Yang et al. have chosen to explore platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta
(PDGFRB) as a candidate gene related to goat reproduction in Shaanbei white
cashmere goats (SBWC). They chose PDGFRB based on association studies in bulls
and mutation studies in mice that show a strong relationship between PDGFRB and
semen production and follicle development, respectively. The authors then did qRT-
PCR on multiple organ tissues and testis tissues from 8 different developmental
stages of SBWC males. 1122 SBWC females were randomly sampled for their
genotype and their litter size was recorded. This paper shows that PDGFRB is
expressed in male tissues and that there is a correlation between litter size and the
heterozygous (Insertion/Deletion) genotype. While the science and statistics seems
to be sound, it is presented in a way that is hard to follow. There are a few points
that I would like clarification on:
- Line 93-94: are the 16 testis tissues per age, or 16 total? If so, that
would only give 2 samples per age, which is not enough biological
replicates for robust statistics.
- For stating that PDGFRB is important for male fertility during meiosis,
are there any genes known to be expressed during the meiotic stage of
spermatogenesis that can be tested at the same time points as PDGFRB
to show that PDGFRB is really upregulated during meiosis?
- Table 5: would this data be better analyzed by a 2-way Anova? I also
don’t understand the need to separate the female goats into sets of 100
individuals. Are you correcting for different lambing times/seasons?
- Table 6 and Table 7: I feel like the information on these two tables is
redundant, they say almost exactly the same thing.
- Figure 3, A : For the II band does not seem to be the same size as the I
band of the ID genotype.
- Figure 3, D: Again the II band and the DD band do not seem to match
the bands in the ID genotype.
Overall, the authors do show that the 10bp indel in PDGFRB is associated with first-
born litter sizes of 2, though I would be interested to know of the effect size of the
ID genotype in the difference between litter size of 1 or 2.

[Question 1]
[1] Line 93-94: are the 16 testis tissues per age, or 16 total? If so, that would
only give 2 samples per age, which is not enough biological replicates for
robust statistics.
[Response1]
Thanks for your constructive suggestions.
The total number of goat testis were total, which was not enough
biological replicates for robust statistics. However, with the development of
modern and intensive breeding condition, the number of male livestock is
especially rare. Moreover, with the popularization of frozen semen, the
breeding of the rams is becoming less and less, which makes it difficult for us
to collect the samples.
Furthermore, our aim was to illustrate the PDGFRB gene mRNA
expression profiles at different developmental stages. Based on previous study,
in the latter step, in order to better illustrate the expression changes of
PDGFRB during mitosis and meiosis, the developmental stages were divided
into two stages: mitosis (2w and 1m, n=7 and n=4 respectively) and meiosis
(2m, n=5) (figure 2B in the revision). Considering the robust statistics, we made
some adjustments and reanalyzed the expression levels in testis of different
ages (figure 2A in the revision).

Expression of PDGFRB mRNA at mitosis (2 w and 1m, n=7 and n=4 respectively) and meiosis (2

[Question 2]
[2] For stating that PDGFRB is important for male fertility during meiosis, are
there any genes
known to be expressed during the meiotic stage of spermatogenesis that can
be tested at
the same time points as PDGFRB to show that PDGFRB is really upregulated
during meiosis?
[Response2]
Thank you for your comment.
According to your suggestions, we tested the expression level of Stra8
(Stimulated By Retinoic Acid 8) at the same time points as PDGFRB.
Previous studies showed that the Liaoning cashmere goat (the male
parent of SBWC) began to mitosis since postnatal, and the primary
spermatocytes that initiated meiosis first occurred at 1 m [25]. Additionally,
RA (Retinoic Acid) could regulate mice spermatogonia cell differentiation as
well as meiotic initiation through the target gene Stra8 [28]. Stra8 was also a
marker gene for other mammalian germ cell mitosis to meiosis, such as rats,
human and goats et al [31, 32]. In this study, the goat Stra8 mRNA expression
was detected using 13 testis samples at different developmental stages. Stra8
was significantly up-regulated at anaphase of mitosis (1 m, P < 0.05), which
proved that the goat started to initiate meiosis about 1 m (figure 2C in the
revision).
Based on these results, in order to better illustrate the expression changes
of PDGFRB during mitosis and meiosis, we divided mitosis into two phases,
which are 0-2w and about 1m respectively. And 1m was the transition period
from mitosis to meiosis. As shown in the figure 2B, compared to the meiosis
stage, the expression of PDGFRB was significantly down-regulated as mitosis
shifted to meiosis (P < 0.01) (figure 2B in the revision).
Moreover, some published articles in our lab also divided 0-1m into
mitosis stage, the 1-2 m considered the meiosis period. For example, Cui et al.
found that KDM6A (lysine demethylase 6A) mRNA expression levels were
significantly increased in meiosis period compared with the mitosis period (P
< 0.05) [26]. And Zhang et al. also revealed that the expression profile of
CTNNB1 (Catenin beta 1) at 1 month was higher than that at 2 month (P < 0.05)
[27].
Based on the previous studies, we believe that our results were credible.
In conclusion, goat PDGFRB gene expression was really upregulated during
mitosis than in meiotic stage.

[Question 3]
[3] Table 5: would this data be better analyzed by a 2-way Anova? I also don’t
understand the
need to separate the female goats into sets of 100 individuals. Are you
correcting for
different lambing times/seasons?
[Response3]
Thanks for your suggestions.
For Table 5, after careful consideration, we think that this data is not
suitable analyzed by a 2-way Anova. 2-way Anova is mainly used to study the
influence of two different factors on the results, and to determine whether
there is a main effect or interaction between the two factors. For example,
when studying the effects of age and gender on height, this analysis results
uncover an interaction or predominance between age and gender. However,
the data of Table 5 was mainly used to study the effect of different genotypes
on the number of first-born litter sizes. And for the comparison of counting
data, the chi-square test (<U+03C7>2 test) was more suitable. Additionally, when the
minimum theoretical frequency was less than 5, Fisher exact tests should be
used. Therefore, we performed a fisher exact test on the data of Table 5 (Table
5 in the revision).
And we divided the female goat into 100 individuals, not correcting the
different lambing time/season. There are three main reasons, as follows: Firstly,
our sample data only counted the number of first-born litter size of the ewes.
And this was a new strategy for analyzing the association between the indel
locus and the first-born litter size. We randomly select 100 individuals from
the entire population as a subset. When an indel locus in any investigated
subset showed a significant correlation with phenotype, it could be considered
that this site was indeed related to the tested trait, especially in large
population. This strategy increases the credibility of the test. Secondly, it could
improve the efficiency of the experiment and save experimental cost and time.
The indel locus could be filtered when there was not related with tested
phenotypic traits in a small population. Finally, Zhang et al. found that the
kidding year and season had no significant effect on the phenotypic value of
litter size (Zhang et al., 2009).
Based the above reasons, we divided female goat into 100 individuals and
used Fisher exact test to analyze the association of this indel with first-born
litter size in large populations.

[Question 4]
[4] Table 6 and Table 7: I feel like the information on these two tables is
redundant, they say
almost exactly the same thing.
[Response4]
Thanks for your useful comment. According to your suggestions, we have
made some adjustments. We have removed Table 6 and only remained Table
7. Additionally, Table 7 and Table 8 moves forward to become revised as Table
6 and Table 7.
[Question 5]
[5] Figure 3, A: For the II band does not seem to be the same size as the I band
of the ID
genotype.
[Response5]
Thank you for your comments on our article.
Owing to the presence of the heteroduplex, the top band of the ID
genotype was not the I band in the origin Figure 3. We re-detected the PCR
product with 3% agarose gel electrophoresis and replaced the original image.
As shown in the Figure 4A of the revision, the top A band of the genotype ID
was a heteroduplex, the middle band was the I band, and the bottom one was
the D band (figure 4A in the revision). Interestingly, there were many similar
studies about heteroduplex. A study had shown that the heteroduplex with a
novel 12-bp indel in the pig Oct4 gene (Ren et al., 2017). And Cui et al. found
that the 16-bp indel of goat KDM6A gene also had a heteroduplex [26]. In fact,
Nagamine et al. also found that heteroduplexes have been shown to occur in
any PCR reaction (Nagamine et al., 1989). And for the original Figure 3A, there
was also a band in the middle of the genotype ID, which was too pale and
difficult to see.

[Response6]
Thank you for your comment.
For the origin Figure 3D, consistent with the reason of Figure 3A, it was
a l s o d u e t o t h e
heteroduplex of A-band and the three bands in the ID genotype of the original
Figure 3D were not completely separated, which made the band of II and DD
different from the bands in the genotype ID. Meanwhile, we re-detected the
PCR product with 3.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and replaced the original
Figure 3D. As shown in the Figure 4D of the revision, the top A band of the
genotype ID was a heteroduplex, the middle band was the I band and the
bottom one was the D band (figure 4D in the revision).

(D) 10 bp indel locus. The letter A indicated a heteroduplex.
[Question 7]
[7] Overall, the authors do show that the 10 bp indel in PDGFRB is associated
with first-born litter sizes of 2, though I would be interested to know of the
effect size of the ID genotype in the difference between litter size of 1 or 2.
[Response7]
we are also interested in this question. And we hypothesized that the 10
bp indel of PDGFRB affected the litter size, probably because of the presence
of a transcription factor binding site in the insertion/deletion region. The
results of online software (http://www.genomatix.de/) prediction showed that
there were two different transcription factors between the region of
insertion/deletion, namely KLF (Kruppel-like factor) and EGRF (epidermal growth
factor receptor) (Figure 6 in the revision) [35]. This discovery provided a
possibility that two factors influence goat litter size. Among them, KLF was
involved in cellular proliferation, survival and differentiation, several KLFs
participated in estradiol signaling in the normal reproductive system, thereby
regulating reproductive development and function [36]. Meanwhile, EGRF
also regulated cell cycle progression, thereby affecting cell proliferation [37].
This suggested that KLFs and EGRF may be associated with reproduction and
affected litter size. Furthermore, some intronic variations may have LD to
mutations with known phenotypes [38]. Such as, Gansmo et al. found that the
40 bp indel in the mouse MDM2 (mouse double minute 2 homolog) gene promoter
P1 was completely LD with a SNP, and this indel locus had positive correlation
with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer [39]. Following these findings,
further study was needed regarding the way in which the 10 bp intronic of the
goat PDGFRB gene affected the phenotype (first-born litter size). In the future,
the mechanism of the effect of mutation genotype ID in the difference between
litter size of 1 or more will be further explored.

Appendix C
Descriptions for the differences between the
previous submission and the current revision
(Wenjing Yang and Chuanying Pan et al.)
Dear editor and the anonymous reviewers,
Based on your comments on manuscript (RSOS-180805), we have revised
the previous submission carefully. The manuscript has been re-checked and
re-edited, and language, grammar and structure issues throughout the former
version have been modified by the professional editors at Charlesworth
(www.cwauthors.com.cn). Compared with the former version, the present
reversion (RSOS-180805R) has several major changes. Here, we make a
detailed explanation to list the relevant changes in the present version with
Blue. We think this revision will be better than the former version. Once again,
thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.
1. For the Abstract, line 35-48 (in the current revision), we had modified the
language and
grammar, which made it more clearer and accuracy. The revised sentences
were listed in the following.
Beta-type platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRB) was a typical tyrosine
kinase, as a candidate gene associated with reproduction. Its main roles
include regulation of migration and proliferation of gonocytes and the cell
cycle. The objectives of this study were to identify mRNA expression of the
goat PDGFRB gene, as well as insertion/deletion (indel) variants and their
association with litter size in 1122 healthy Shaanbei white cashmere goats
(SBWC). The results revealed that PDGFRB was widely expressed in all tested
tissues, and the expression levels in testes at different developmental stages
indicated a potential association with the mitosis-to-meiosis transition.
Furthermore, the expression of PDGFRB was relatively higher in the ovary
tissue of mothers of two lambs (MTL) compared with mothers of single lamb
(MSL). These results implied that PDGFRB was related to goat fertility.
Meanwhile, two intronic indels, 5 bp (n=501) and 10 bp (n=1122), were
identified. Statistical analysis revealed that only the 10 bp indel was associated
with first-born litter size (n=1122, P=6.030×10-5), and that individuals of
genotype insertion/deletion were more excellent than those of genotype
insertion/insertion. Overall, these results indicated that the 10 bp indel of
PDGFRB could be used in marker-assisted selection (MAS) during goat
genetic breeding.
2. For the Introduction, line 84 (in the current revision), “and different
developmental stages
of testis” was modified to “and at different developmental stages in the testis
and the ovary of ewes of different litter size”.
3. For the Materials and methods, we add 7 ovaries of ewes of different litter
size. Line 93-94
and 114-116 (in the current revision) made some appropriate changes. As
follows:
“Moreover, a total of 16 testis tissues were also sampled at 0 d, 3 d, 1 w, 2 w, 3
w, 4 w, 6 w, 8 w.” was rewrite to “Moreover, a total of 16 testis tissues at 0 d,
3 d, 1 w, 2 w, 3 w, 4 w, 6 w and 8 w, and ovaries from 7 ewes that had different
litter size were also sampled.”
“In addition, the testis tissues expression profiles were also tested at different
periods (0 d, 3 d, 1 w, 2 w, 3 w, 4 w, 6 w, 8 w).” was rewrite to “In addition,
the expression profiles of testis tissue at different times (0 d, 3 d, 1 w, 2 w, 3 w,
4 w, 6 w and 8 w) and ovarian tissue of ewes of different litter size (MSL:
mothers of single lamb and MTL: mothers of two lambs) were also examined.”
4. For the Materials and methods, line 149-158 (in the current revision), we
had modified the
structure, language and grammar. The revised sentences were listed in the
following:
Distribution differences for genotypic and allelic frequencies were analyzed
using the <U+03C7>2 test or Fisher exact tests (when the minimum theoretical frequency
was less than 5) in SPSS (Version 19.0).
Association between the indel loci and first-born litter size was analyzed
with a general linear model: Yijklm = µ + Si + HYSj + Pk + Gl + eijklm, where
Yijklm was the phenotypic value of litter size, µ was the overall population
mean, Si was the effect of lambing year, HYSj was the mean of the population,
Pk was the fixed effect of the parity, Gl was the fixed effect of the genotype and
eijklm was the random error [23, 24]. The lambing year and parity were not
considered in the model, since the data of litter size used in this study was
first-born litter size. Further analysis was performed with SPSS 19.0 software
using Student’s t test (T-test), the data was rejected when n < 5. And P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
5. For the Results, line 176-186 (in the current revision), based on your
suggestion, we tested
the mRNA expression level of Stra8 (Stimulated by Retinoic Acid 8) at the same
time points as PDGFRB and goat PDGFRB gene in ovary of ewes of different
litter size.
So, we compared the expression levels of PDGFRB gene in testis during the
mitosis periods of 0-2 w and 1 m (n=7 and n=4, respectively) and the meiosis
period of 1-2 m (n=5) [26, 27], compared to the meiosis stage, the expression
of PDGFRB was significantly down-regulated as mitosis shifted to meiosis (P
< 0.01) (figure 2B). The expression level of Stra8 (Stimulated By Retinoic Acid 8),
a marker gene for mammalian germ cell mitosis to meiosis [28], was
significantly up-regulated during anaphase of mitosis (1 m) (P < 0.05) (figure
2C). In short, these results indicated that the PDGFRB gene played an
important role in male reproduction.
Next, the expression of PDGFRB gene in goat ovaries of ewes of different
litter size showed that expression of the PDGFRB gene in MTL was
significantly higher than that in MSL (P < 0.05) (figure 3). This proved that the
goat PDGFRB gene was also essential for female reproduction.
6. For the Discussion, line 241-244 (in the current revision), the sentence of
“The expression
level of PDGFRB was highest at 0 d, and the expression level at 42 d and 56 d
were significantly lower than other stages (P < 0.05) (figure 2A). Previously,
the spermatogonia were produced by gonocytes that migrated to the basal
membrane, which established and maintained spermatogenesis in the mature
testis of mice.” was rewrite to “The expression level of PDGFRB was highest
at 0 d, and at 6 w and 8 w it was lower than other at stages (figure 2A).
Previously, the spermatogonia mature from gonocytes that migrated to the
basal membrane, a process which established and maintained
spermatogenesis in the mature murine testis.”
7. For the Discussion, line 249-259 (in the current revision), based on your
suggestion, we re-
conducted the discussion based on the results.
We therefore speculated similar characteristics for this period in SBWC, and
combined individuals of 0 d, 3 d, 1 w, 2 w, 3 w and 4 w as mitosis period (2 w
and 1 m), similarly the data of 6w and 8w were considered as meiosis period
(2 m). Our results illustrated that the expression level of PDGFRB in SBWC
during meiosis was significantly lower than that in the mitosis period (P < 0.01)
(figure 2B). Moreover, we also tested the expression level of Stra8 (Stimulated
By Retinoic Acid 8) at the same time points as PDGFRB. Retinoic Acid (RA)
regulated mice spermatogonia cell differentiation as well as meiotic initiation
through the target gene Stra8, and Stra8 was also a marker gene for other
mammalian germ cell mitosis to meiosis, such as rats, human and goats et al
[28,31-32]. As shown in the figure 2C, Stra8 was significantly up-regulated at
anaphase of mitosis (1 m, P < 0.05) (figure 2C). Overall, these results revealed
that the PDGFRB gene was essential for the production of spermatogonia and
was associated with goat male reproduction.
8. For the Discussion, line 263-264 (in the current revision), we add a
s e n t e n c e t o t h e
discussion based on the results.
From the current study, figure 3, showed that the expression of the PDGFRB
gene in MTL was significantly higher than that in MSL (P < 0.05) (figure 3).
9. For the Discussion, line 299-309 (in the current revision), the sentence was
rewrite to make
them clear.
This discovery provided a possibility that two factors influence goat litter size.
Among them, KLF was involved in cellular proliferation, survival and
differentiation, several KLFs participated in estradiol signaling in the normal
reproductive system, thereby regulating reproductive development and
function [36]. Meanwhile, EGRF also regulated cell cycle progression, thereby
affecting cell proliferation [37]. This suggested that KLFs and EGRF may be
associated with reproduction and affected litter size. Furthermore, some
intronic variations may have LD to mutations with known phenotypes [38].
Such as, Gansmo et al. found that the 40 bp indel in the mouse MDM2 (mouse
double minute 2 homolog) gene promoter P1 was completely LD with a SNP,
and this indel locus had positive correlation with a reduced risk of
endometrial cancer [39]. Following these findings, the further study was
needed regarding the way in which the 10 bp intronic of the goat PDGFRB
gene affected the phenotype (first-born litter size).
10. For the Authors' contributions, line 333-335 (in the current revision),
b a s e d o n y o u r
suggested format, we rewrited this place.

sincerely thank those
who have helped this article.
We greatly thanked the staffs of Shaanbei white cashmere goat breeding farm,
Shaanxi province, P.R. China for their collecting samples.

Review
“Goat PDGFRB: unique mRNA expression profile in gonad and significant
association between genetic variation and litter size”
Yang et al.
Oct 15, 2018
I am satisfied with how the authors responded to my questions and criticism, and
the paper is much more readable now. I think the authors misinterpreted what I
meant by effect size, it is the magnitude of the difference between groups, though I
was happy to see my comment led to a more in-depth discussion about what the
10bp indel could be doing. There are still a few minor problems with the English,
though I realize a couple of these corrections are just my personal preference (my
corrections are in red, and I’m using the line numbers closest to the text):
Line 36-37 : “…(PDGFRB) is a typical tyrosine kinase and a candidate gene associated
with reproduction.”
Line 37-38 : “…include the regulation of gonocytes (migration and proliferation) and
of the cell cycle.”
Line 47-48: “…that individuals of the genotype instertion/deletion (ID) had larger
litter sizes than those of the genotype insertion/insertion (II).”

Line 81-82: completely changing the sentence of this paragraph “So far there have
been no relevant reports regarding the function of the PDGFRB gene in Shaanbei

Line 86-87: mention where you found out about the 5bp and 10bp indels! You don’t
mention where you found the indels until the discussion but it should be in the
introduction.
