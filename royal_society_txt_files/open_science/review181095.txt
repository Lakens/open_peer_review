I rather like this paper though for me it tantalises more than it reveals. I feel it could be fleshed
out a bit more, particularly with regard to the biggest ‘hit’ in point 3 below:
1. There is an assertion that these are the only sets of genomes that are suitable. This may be so,
but it would be nice to hear the reasons why obvious candidates like Drosophila are not included.
2. I would like to see more justification for the size of the ‘burst edge’. I realise that very short
edges carry too little information and on longer edges the burst is diluted. However, unless I
have overlooked something, the figure of 0.005 seems to be presented without clear reason: is it a
value that is selected to include all short edges? Would increasing the threshold to 0.01, say, add
more edges? Was there any kind of optimisation process conducted? To me it seems rather
important because if a modest change in threshold increases the number of usable edges, this
could add considerably to the analysis.
3. The values for DNAJC11 look unreal. 39:1?? Really? Wow. To me this needs greater
exploration. For example, what is the dN/dS ratio for this protein in other species: is the gene
generally highly selected or does this represent a one-off event? It is also worth testing whether
this represents positive selection for change or ‘normal’ selection plus a very high mutation rate.
By this I mean it could be that any change to the amino acid sequence is beneficial (perhaps!).
Alternatively, there could be huge numbers of changes due to a very high mutation rate, and of
these a small subset is selected, but because of the high mutation rate, this is still a large number.
In reality, I struggle to see how 39:1 can work because it implies that neutral, non-synonymous
changes never hitchhike, which seems unlikely. In short, this ratio is so very extreme that I think
it needs extra work to show that it is biologically plausible / even possible.

Overall, I am enthusiastic about the manuscript “Bursts of amino acid replacements in protein
evolution” by Stolyarova and colleagues. I have long been interested in the topic of
overdispersion in protein evolution and I believe the authors make a substantial advance in the
field. I’d like to start my review by highlighting a few general concerns I have regarding the
writing, then move on to specific concerns, and finish with a brief discussion of criticisms in the
other reviews that do not concern me (i.e., areas where I feel the authors’ work is solid and the
criticisms are not valid).
The general criticism that I would articulate about the paper is the rather telegraphic style.
Although the material that is there is well-written and clear, there is certainly room to expand the
manuscript in a number of places. Royal Society Open Science does not have a word limit.
Obviously, the absence of a word limit should not be viewed as a license to include irrelevant
information. However, the current manuscript goes much too far in the opposite direction; I
believe information that is necessary to understand and evaluate the science has been omitted.
With respect to the writing, I would like to start out with the introduction. The very first
paragraph, which is critical to set up the contrast of gradual vs. punctuated evolution seems to be
somewhat muddled. As it is currently written, the introduction jumps back and forth in terms of
gradualistic and punctuated tempos for evolution and between molecular evolution and whole
organism evolution. I think this is what reviewer 3 was responding to in their statement that
“…the manuscript attempts to frame [the authors’] research in terms of punctuated evolution and
stasis, which [reviewer 3] found much less relevant” than discussing the authors’ work in the
context of overdispersion.
Of course, the authors are correct when they responded to this by stating that there “…is no
fundamental difference between overdispersed rate of evolution and alternating episodes of
evolution and stasis.” However, there can be many causes for alternating episodes of stasis and
evolution and the causes of punctuation in molecular and morphological evolution. All of the
examples of gradual evolution are molecular, despite the long history of using Brownian motion
to model drift in morphological data (see O’Meara et al. 2006). If the authors are going to include
examples of morphological evolution they acknowledge that gradual evolution of morphology is
possible (indeed, it is often viewed as a null hypothesis).
Another aspect of the introduction that I found troubling is that all of the examples they cite to
illustrate gradual evolution are molecular clock studies; to my knowledge molecular clock studies
have not tested for overdispersion. Some overdispersed loci might be rejected indirectly when
tests of the clock are performed, but modern relaxed clock studies might very well retain some
loci that appear non-clocklike due to overdispersion. Studies that use molecular clocks (especially
relaxed molecular clocks) are not evidence of gradual evolution per se, unless those studies test
for overdispersion (i.e., punctuation) and reject it in favor of gradualism (at least for a subset of
loci). Note that there are cases where the overdispersion hypothesis has been explicitly tested and
rejected (e.g., Goldman 1994)
This brings us to the causes of punctuated evolution. At the morphological level it seems likely to
me that most examples of punctuation reflect selection. This is really what the authors are looking
for at the molecular level. However, there are causes of punctuation at the molecular level that
reflect neutral evolution rather than selection. The authors acknowledge one of these
explanations: gene conversion. However, the authors do not appear to acknowledge that one of
4
explanation for punctuated molecular evolution offered in the Pagel et al. (2006) study that they
cite. Specifically, Pagel et al. (2006) stated that if “…speciation is associated with small founder
populations and if genetic isolation is maintained, evolutionary rates can be accelerated at
potentially all loci, because the number of loci with alleles governed by drift (neutral plus nearly
neutral) is increased.” In other words, Pagel et al. (2006) appear to favor a nearly neutral theory
explanation for punctuation. Of course, Pagel et al. (2006) do offer selection as an alternative,
stating that a “…second general mechanism for divergence is adaptive evolution as species
invade new niches.” The latter mechanism is the obviously what the authors hope to detect, but it
is important that they set up the alternatives carefully.
Overall, I really think the manuscript would be better served with an almost complete rewrite of
the introduction. As I said, I agree completely that overdispersion is equivalent to alternating
episodes of stasis and evolution. However, I did not feel that the introduction set up the analyses
reported in the paper. Moreover, the extreme terseness of the introduction (and the manuscript as
a whole) has led me to indicate to the editor that the language in its current form is not
acceptable. I debated doing so since I usually state that language is unacceptable if there are
statements I simply cannot understand. In this manuscript it is more the case that statements are
too terse.
In addition to these problems, I feel that the authors were somewhat sloppy with their citations. I
have already brought up the issue that citing studies that use the molecular clock to estimate
divergence times as evidence for gradualism is inappropriate; evidence for gradualism requires
an actual test for overdispersion. The authors also cited the original Zuckerkandl and Pauling
(1965) paper describing molecules as documents of evolutionary history in the context of
selectively neutral segments of genomes; Zukerkandl and Pauling (1965) predated neutral theory
(Kimura 1968; King and Jukes 1969). I also fail to see how Cooney et al. (2017) represents an
example of “gradual adaptive evolution”; after all, Cooney et al. (2017) state that their results
“…support Darwinian9 and Simpsonian4 ideas of microevolution within adaptive zones and
accelerated evolution between distinct adaptive peaks” (numbers in Cooney et al. 2017 quote are
citations within that publication). The statement in Cooney et al. (2017) would seem to support a
“burst” of substitution where taxa move from one adaptive peak to another. Finally, I was
surprised by the failure to cite Gillespie (1991), which I believe to be the classic text describing
overdispersed molecular evolution. Finally, the authors should make sure their references are
formatted properly; I noticed that Moores et al. (1999) is cited in the text as Ø Moores, Vamosi
and Schluter, (1999); the authors should fix this and ensure there are no other mistakes regarding
their citations.
Once I got past the introduction I felt the paper was much better and I generally became
enthusiastic. The authors present evidence for adaptive overdispersed molecular evolution that I
find quite compelling. I only have three issues with the current manuscript; I believe all three to
be very important for the authors to address.
1. The issue of gene tree-species tree discordance.
Reviewer 3 also brought up the issue of discordance among gene trees, which the authors
dismissed as not being a problem because they “…discarded the genes with poorly reconstructed
ancestral sequences, which will be the case for discordant genes (e.g. caused by incomplete
lineage sorting).” In other words, the authors reconstructed ancestral sequences using the species
tree as the underlying topology and then examined posterior probabilities for the ancestral state
reconstructions, discarding loci with low posterior probabilities. I am not at all convinced that
poorly reconstructed ancestral sequences (as revealed by low posterior probabilities) are evidence
of discordance due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS).
5
I will illustrate my assertion that “codeml posterior probabilities for the reconstructed ancestral
variant < 0.8” will not necessarily highlight loci with discordant gene trees using two scenarios.
First, let us imagine a gene encoded by a locus that has a gene tree that is perfectly congruent
with the species tree and further postulate that the gene is rapidly evolving. I would expect the
high degree of homoplasy that I postulated in this scenario to lead to low codeml posterior
probabilities. Second, let us postulate a relatively slowly evolving gene associated with a locus
that has a gene tree with some discordance due to ILS. The ILS could lead to some sites in the
alignment that appear homoplastic (the appearance of homoplasy given the species tree due to
gene tree-species tree discordance is called hemiplasy; see Avise & Robinson 2008) and the
ancestral state reconstructions of those sites those might have reduced posterior probabilities. In
this example the ancestral state reconstructions may also be incorrect given that they reflect
hemiplasy that is misinterpreted as homoplasy, but I do not think it is a given that the
reconstructions will definitely have a posterior probability <0.8.
Note that this discussion is not a criticism of the chosen posterior probability cut-off; it is an
intrinsic problem with the interpretation of ancestral state reconstructions that have low posterior
probabilities as reflecting discordance due to ILS. Basically, there are multiple ways for codeml
ancestral state reconstruction to have low posterior probabilities for the reconstructed ancestral
variants. Discordance due to ILS is likely to be one way since hemiplasy does create the
appearance of homoplasy given the species tree. However, unless the authors have done
simulations showing that low posterior probabilities in codeml reconstructions are definitely
indicative of discordance I do not believe they should state they are.
Does this have a practical impact on the analyses that the authors present? I am uncertain
whether it does because I am uncertain how much discordance among gene trees exists in the
datasets the authors examined. A simple way for the authors to assess discordance is to look for
incongruent gene trees. I am well aware that error in gene tree estimation is a problem for
estimating the amount of incongruence among gene trees (for examples of my publications in the
area see Patel et al. 2013 and Meiklejohn et al. 2016). However, there is a simple solution for the
authors: estimate gene trees with support values using a standard method, such as maximum
likelihood (ML) bootstrapping using RAxML (Stamatakis 2014) or IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al. 2015),
collapse all branches with less than some amount of support (e.g., 75% standard bootstrap
support), and only consider branches with support when examining incongruence. There are
important statistical issues with this approach, since there will be some errors (i.e., some branches
will appear to be incongruent when they are not). However, it is a better criterion than using
posterior probabilities of ancestral state reconstructions because the number of branches with
support that conflict with the species tree is a direct measure of incongruence. Ideally, the authors
would present this information for all genes (i.e., XX% of the branches in each gene tree received
>75% bootstrap support; YY% of those branches conflicted with the species tree) but they should
present this information for the cases where they found significant evidence for bursts.
I actually doubt that this will change their conclusions. It seems likely to me that the bursts define
branches that are present in the gene tree. For example, if the 39 non-synonymous substitutions in
the amphipod DNAJC11 sequences do not define a clade in the DNAJC11 gene tree then one has
to postulate a truly astounding degree of convergence that also happens to appear to be
synapomorphic changes when mapped on the species tree. Of course, the DNAJC11 gene tree
could be discordant with the species tree elsewhere, but that doesn’t matter from the standpoint
of inferring bursts of substitutions.
Overall, I am not convinced that gene tree discordance is a problem but the way that the authors
address it is not appropriate. At a minimum they should infer ML phylogenies for each gene with
a burst and ask whether the branch in the species tree with the burst is present in the gene tree.
6
There are four possible outcomes for this analysis of the gene tree: 1) the branch with the burst is
present in the gene tree and supported by the ML bootstrap; 2) the branch with the burst is
present in the gene tree but it is not supported by the ML bootstrap; 3) a branch that conflicts
with relevant branch in the species tree is present but that conflicting branch is not supported by
the ML bootstrap; and 4) a branch that conflicts with relevant branch in the species tree is present
and the conflicting branch is supported by the ML bootstrap. It is only in case #4 that discordance
can be said to be a potential problem. The more general analyses of incongruence that I mention
above would be interesting, but it is not critical for the authors to prove their point.
2. The puzzle underlying the mutational basis for their extreme cases of overdispersion
I believe that DNAJC11 illustrates something that may be even more interesting than the scenario
that the authors postulate. I’d like to start by considering two limits on the rate of accumulation
of non-synonymous substitutions given that the authors state that the relevant branch in the
species tree has a very short synonymous length (dS = 0.004).
Let’s begin with what I’ll call the “neutral limit.” There are there are 1515 sites in the alignment (I
am using gap free sites, but the total number of sites is not much larger). If we assume the
number of synonymous sites is ~1/3 of the total number of the expected number of synonymous
substitutions for that branch is ~2. If we assume synonymous sites are selectively neutral the rate
of accumulation for synonymous substitutions is the mutation rate (Kimura 1968). Obviously,
many non-synonymous sites will be subject to purifying selection but this dS would imply that, if
all non-synonymous sites were selectively neutral (i.e., if dN/dS = 1.0), that the expected number
of non-synonymous substitutions is only ~4. However, the authors observed 39 non-synonymous
substitutions in this locus; the probability of this many non-synonymous substitutions when the
expected number of substitutions if we assume a Poisson process is extremely low. Of course, the
authors would reply “that is our point” to this description of the “neutral limit.” However, my
point in articulating this to place a lower limit on the number of non-synonymous substitutions
that it is reasonable to expect if selection for changes at individual sites is relatively weak; the
expectation given neutrality provides that lower limit. I would add that this “neutral limit” is
really just a restatement of the authors’ null hypothesis; in fact, they stated that they “…assumed
the neutral null model (dN=dS)” and emphasized that this will make “…it possible to detect only
the longest and the fastests[sic] bursts.”
Another way of articulating the fact that the authors’ method can “…detect only the longest and
the fastests[sic] bursts” is to say that the non-synonymous substitutions must be subject to strong
selection. However, this need for strong selection on new non-synonymous variants brings us to
a different limit that I’ll call the “Hill-Robertson limit.” If we assume the selection for individual
non-synonymous changes is strong then those alleles should be fixed rapidly. This would tend to
eliminate other alleles, even if those other alleles are advantageous relative to the ancestral allele.
This is just a restatement of the well-known Hill & Robertson (1966) effect. Given Hill-Robertson
interference one must assume that a large number of potential non-synonymous changes become
advantageous and then occur successively. In other words, Hill-Robertson interference requires
one to postulate the following scenario: 1) a new advantageous mutation enters the population; 2)
the new mutation becomes fixed in the (metaphorical) blink of an eye; 3) another advantageous
mutation enters the population (in the background of newly fixed advantageous allele); and 4)
this cycle repeats for a total of 39 times. Moreover, even if on imagines an environmental shift
occurs that favors specific substitutions at >30 sites one would think that epistatic interactions
among sites within the protein would create issues (though I suppose one could also argue that
epistasis might create new “opportunities” for changes that are subject to positive selection).
Perhaps there are parts of parameter space (i.e., mutation rate, generation time, effective
population size, selection coefficients on individual sites, etc.) where this can occur. But it seems
to me that the “good” part of parameter space might be very small.
7
I can see two ways out of the narrow space created by these two limits: 1) recombination rates are
high enough to overcome Hill-Robertson interference; or 2) the mutation that generated these
non-synonymous changes altered multiple sites. The first explanation would probably require
that there is a reasonable rate of recombination between sites that are ~10 bp apart (some of the
amino acid substitutions uniting the group defined by shading in Fig. 1 are 2-3 amino acids
apart). The second might imply that only a subset of the non-synonymous substitutions are
advantageous; the remainder were simply “dragged” to fixation by the advantageous change(s).
Both possibilities are interesting. It is debatable whether this argument applies to all of their
examples, but the authors were looking for exceptional outcomes. Perhaps the exceptional
outcomes indicate that surprising molecular mechanisms exist.
Finally, the authors should fix the misspelling of “fastest” indicated above using “[sic]”.
3. The base composition of synonymous sites
dS can be underestimated when there is strong codon bias (Rabinowicz et al. 1999). The authors
should present the base composition (and variation among loci in their base composition) for the
data used to calculate dS.
4. The location of non-synonymous substitutions
The secondary structure of the Catarrhini PKR sequences is shown but the secondary structure of
the DNAJC11 sequences is not shown. I’m not convinced that presenting the secondary structure
is important unless other information is provided, but the authors should be consistent. It is more
important to indicate the locations of the substitutions relative to the boundaries of protein
domains, which the authors do for PKR. It would be good to do this for DNAJC11 as well; for
example, how many of the 39 substitutions are located in the J domain?
Finally, there are two words that should be fixed in the Fig. 3 legend: “others” and “in”. I have
indicated them in CAPS below:
“Fig. 3. Alignment of PKR genes of Catarrhini (fragments) containing 18 nonsynonymous
substitutions on the internal edge ancestral to Macaca mulatta and Macaca fascicularis. The
majority of substitutions (14) occurred in the kinase domain of the protein, the OTHERS fall IN
the dsRNA binding motif (DRBM1). Alleles derived in the adaptive burst are shown in bold.”
5. Data accessibility
I was unable to access the Dryad data package. Assuming that it is made available and includes
(at a minimum) the following:
1) Nucleotide sequence alignments of the loci they examined (ideally all sequences) in a readily
usable format (e.g., nexus or relaxed phylip).
2) The phylogenetic trees they used for their analyses in newick format.
3) The gene names and functional annotations (especially the blast2GO data for the amphipods).
I think it will be appropriate.
I would like to emphasize, despite the fact that I wrote a long review pointing out issues, that I
am enthusiastic about this manuscript. I think the authors have presented good evidence for their
central assertion that there were adaptive bursts occur in small numbers of proteins. Thus, I
8
believe the science is sound. I also think their conclusions are of broad interest.
I hope the authors and editor find these comments helpful.

out a bit more, particularly with regard to the biggest ‘hit’ in point 3 below:
1. There is an assertion that these are the only sets of genomes that are suitable. This may be so,
but it would be nice to hear the reasons why obvious candidates like Drosophila are not included.
2. I would like to see more justification for the size of the ‘burst edge’. I realise that very short
edges carry too little information and on longer edges the burst is diluted. However, unless I
have overlooked something, the figure of 0.005 seems to be presented without clear reason: is it a
value that is selected to include all short edges? Would increasing the threshold to 0.01, say, add
more edges? Was there any kind of optimisation process conducted? To me it seems rather
important because if a modest change in threshold increases the number of usable edges, this
could add considerably to the analysis.
3. The values for DNAJC11 look unreal. 39:1?? Really? Wow. To me this needs greater
exploration. For example, what is the dN/dS ratio for this protein in other species: is the gene
generally highly selected or does this represent a one-off event? It is also worth testing whether
this represents positive selection for change or ‘normal’ selection plus a very high mutation rate.
By this I mean it could be that any change to the amino acid sequence is beneficial (perhaps!).
Alternatively, there could be huge numbers of changes due to a very high mutation rate, and of
these a small subset is selected, but because of the high mutation rate, this is still a large number.
In reality, I struggle to see how 39:1 can work because it implies that neutral, non-synonymous
changes never hitchhike, which seems unlikely. In short, this ratio is so very extreme that I think
it needs extra work to show that it is biologically plausible / even possible.

Comments to the Author(s)
Overall, I am enthusiastic about the manuscript “Bursts of amino acid replacements in protein
evolution” by Stolyarova and colleagues. I have long been interested in the topic of
overdispersion in protein evolution and I believe the authors make a substantial advance in the
field. I’d like to start my review by highlighting a few general concerns I have regarding the
writing, then move on to specific concerns, and finish with a brief discussion of criticisms in the
other reviews that do not concern me (i.e., areas where I feel the authors’ work is solid and the
criticisms are not valid).
The general criticism that I would articulate about the paper is the rather telegraphic style.
Although the material that is there is well-written and clear, there is certainly room to expand the
manuscript in a number of places. Royal Society Open Science does not have a word limit.
Obviously, the absence of a word limit should not be viewed as a license to include irrelevant
information. However, the current manuscript goes much too far in the opposite direction; I
believe information that is necessary to understand and evaluate the science has been omitted.
12
With respect to the writing, I would like to start out with the introduction. The very first
paragraph, which is critical to set up the contrast of gradual vs. punctuated evolution seems to be
somewhat muddled. As it is currently written, the introduction jumps back and forth in terms of
gradualistic and punctuated tempos for evolution and between molecular evolution and whole
organism evolution. I think this is what reviewer 3 was responding to in their statement that
“…the manuscript attempts to frame [the authors’] research in terms of punctuated evolution and
stasis, which [reviewer 3] found much less relevant” than discussing the authors’ work in the
context of overdispersion.
Of course, the authors are correct when they responded to this by stating that there “…is no
fundamental difference between overdispersed rate of evolution and alternating episodes of
evolution and stasis.” However, there can be many causes for alternating episodes of stasis and
evolution and the causes of punctuation in molecular and morphological evolution. All of the
examples of gradual evolution are molecular, despite the long history of using Brownian motion
to model drift in morphological data (see O’Meara et al. 2006). If the authors are going to include
examples of morphological evolution they acknowledge that gradual evolution of morphology is
possible (indeed, it is often viewed as a null hypothesis).
Another aspect of the introduction that I found troubling is that all of the examples they cite to
illustrate gradual evolution are molecular clock studies; to my knowledge molecular clock studies
have not tested for overdispersion. Some overdispersed loci might be rejected indirectly when
tests of the clock are performed, but modern relaxed clock studies might very well retain some
loci that appear non-clocklike due to overdispersion. Studies that use molecular clocks (especially
relaxed molecular clocks) are not evidence of gradual evolution per se, unless those studies test
for overdispersion (i.e., punctuation) and reject it in favor of gradualism (at least for a subset of
loci). Note that there are cases where the overdispersion hypothesis has been explicitly tested and
rejected (e.g., Goldman 1994)
This brings us to the causes of punctuated evolution. At the morphological level it seems likely to
me that most examples of punctuation reflect selection. This is really what the authors are looking
for at the molecular level. However, there are causes of punctuation at the molecular level that
reflect neutral evolution rather than selection. The authors acknowledge one of these
explanations: gene conversion. However, the authors do not appear to acknowledge that one of
explanation for punctuated molecular evolution offered in the Pagel et al. (2006) study that they
cite. Specifically, Pagel et al. (2006) stated that if “…speciation is associated with small founder
populations and if genetic isolation is maintained, evolutionary rates can be accelerated at
potentially all loci, because the number of loci with alleles governed by drift (neutral plus nearly
neutral) is increased.” In other words, Pagel et al. (2006) appear to favor a nearly neutral theory
explanation for punctuation. Of course, Pagel et al. (2006) do offer selection as an alternative,
stating that a “…second general mechanism for divergence is adaptive evolution as species
invade new niches.” The latter mechanism is the obviously what the authors hope to detect, but it
is important that they set up the alternatives carefully.
Overall, I really think the manuscript would be better served with an almost complete rewrite of
the introduction. As I said, I agree completely that overdispersion is equivalent to alternating
episodes of stasis and evolution. However, I did not feel that the introduction set up the analyses
reported in the paper. Moreover, the extreme terseness of the introduction (and the manuscript as
a whole) has led me to indicate to the editor that the language in its current form is not
acceptable. I debated doing so since I usually state that language is unacceptable if there are
statements I simply cannot understand. In this manuscript it is more the case that statements are
too terse.
13
In addition to these problems, I feel that the authors were somewhat sloppy with their citations. I
have already brought up the issue that citing studies that use the molecular clock to estimate
divergence times as evidence for gradualism is inappropriate; evidence for gradualism requires
an actual test for overdispersion. The authors also cited the original Zuckerkandl and Pauling
(1965) paper describing molecules as documents of evolutionary history in the context of
selectively neutral segments of genomes; Zukerkandl and Pauling (1965) predated neutral theory
(Kimura 1968; King and Jukes 1969). I also fail to see how Cooney et al. (2017) represents an
example of “gradual adaptive evolution”; after all, Cooney et al. (2017) state that their results
“…support Darwinian9 and Simpsonian4 ideas of microevolution within adaptive zones and
accelerated evolution between distinct adaptive peaks” (numbers in Cooney et al. 2017 quote are
citations within that publication). The statement in Cooney et al. (2017) would seem to support a
“burst” of substitution where taxa move from one adaptive peak to another. Finally, I was
surprised by the failure to cite Gillespie (1991), which I believe to be the classic text describing
overdispersed molecular evolution. Finally, the authors should make sure their references are
formatted properly; I noticed that Moores et al. (1999) is cited in the text as Ø Moores, Vamosi
and Schluter, (1999); the authors should fix this and ensure there are no other mistakes regarding
their citations.
Once I got past the introduction I felt the paper was much better and I generally became
enthusiastic. The authors present evidence for adaptive overdispersed molecular evolution that I
find quite compelling. I only have three issues with the current manuscript; I believe all three to
be very important for the authors to address.
1. The issue of gene tree-species tree discordance.
Reviewer 3 also brought up the issue of discordance among gene trees, which the authors
dismissed as not being a problem because they “…discarded the genes with poorly reconstructed
ancestral sequences, which will be the case for discordant genes (e.g. caused by incomplete
lineage sorting).” In other words, the authors reconstructed ancestral sequences using the species
tree as the underlying topology and then examined posterior probabilities for the ancestral state
reconstructions, discarding loci with low posterior probabilities. I am not at all convinced that
poorly reconstructed ancestral sequences (as revealed by low posterior probabilities) are evidence
of discordance due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS).
I will illustrate my assertion that “codeml posterior probabilities for the reconstructed ancestral
variant < 0.8” will not necessarily highlight loci with discordant gene trees using two scenarios.
First, let us imagine a gene encoded by a locus that has a gene tree that is perfectly congruent
with the species tree and further postulate that the gene is rapidly evolving. I would expect the
high degree of homoplasy that I postulated in this scenario to lead to low codeml posterior
probabilities. Second, let us postulate a relatively slowly evolving gene associated with a locus
that has a gene tree with some discordance due to ILS. The ILS could lead to some sites in the
alignment that appear homoplastic (the appearance of homoplasy given the species tree due to
gene tree-species tree discordance is called hemiplasy; see Avise & Robinson 2008) and the
ancestral state reconstructions of those sites those might have reduced posterior probabilities. In
this example the ancestral state reconstructions may also be incorrect given that they reflect
hemiplasy that is misinterpreted as homoplasy, but I do not think it is a given that the
reconstructions will definitely have a posterior probability <0.8.
Note that this discussion is not a criticism of the chosen posterior probability cut-off; it is an
intrinsic problem with the interpretation of ancestral state reconstructions that have low posterior
probabilities as reflecting discordance due to ILS. Basically, there are multiple ways for codeml
ancestral state reconstruction to have low posterior probabilities for the reconstructed ancestral
14
variants. Discordance due to ILS is likely to be one way since hemiplasy does create the
appearance of homoplasy given the species tree. However, unless the authors have done
simulations showing that low posterior probabilities in codeml reconstructions are definitely
indicative of discordance I do not believe they should state they are.
Does this have a practical impact on the analyses that the authors present? I am uncertain
whether it does because I am uncertain how much discordance among gene trees exists in the
datasets the authors examined. A simple way for the authors to assess discordance is to look for
incongruent gene trees. I am well aware that error in gene tree estimation is a problem for
estimating the amount of incongruence among gene trees (for examples of my publications in the
area see Patel et al. 2013 and Meiklejohn et al. 2016). However, there is a simple solution for the
authors: estimate gene trees with support values using a standard method, such as maximum
likelihood (ML) bootstrapping using RAxML (Stamatakis 2014) or IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al. 2015),
collapse all branches with less than some amount of support (e.g., 75% standard bootstrap
support), and only consider branches with support when examining incongruence. There are
important statistical issues with this approach, since there will be some errors (i.e., some branches
will appear to be incongruent when they are not). However, it is a better criterion than using
posterior probabilities of ancestral state reconstructions because the number of branches with
support that conflict with the species tree is a direct measure of incongruence. Ideally, the authors
would present this information for all genes (i.e., XX% of the branches in each gene tree received
>75% bootstrap support; YY% of those branches conflicted with the species tree) but they should
present this information for the cases where they found significant evidence for bursts.
I actually doubt that this will change their conclusions. It seems likely to me that the bursts define
branches that are present in the gene tree. For example, if the 39 non-synonymous substitutions in
the amphipod DNAJC11 sequences do not define a clade in the DNAJC11 gene tree then one has
to postulate a truly astounding degree of convergence that also happens to appear to be
synapomorphic changes when mapped on the species tree. Of course, the DNAJC11 gene tree
could be discordant with the species tree elsewhere, but that doesn’t matter from the standpoint
of inferring bursts of substitutions.
Overall, I am not convinced that gene tree discordance is a problem but the way that the authors
address it is not appropriate. At a minimum they should infer ML phylogenies for each gene with
a burst and ask whether the branch in the species tree with the burst is present in the gene tree.
There are four possible outcomes for this analysis of the gene tree: 1) the branch with the burst is
present in the gene tree and supported by the ML bootstrap; 2) the branch with the burst is
present in the gene tree but it is not supported by the ML bootstrap; 3) a branch that conflicts
with relevant branch in the species tree is present but that conflicting branch is not supported by
the ML bootstrap; and 4) a branch that conflicts with relevant branch in the species tree is present
and the conflicting branch is supported by the ML bootstrap. It is only in case #4 that discordance
can be said to be a potential problem. The more general analyses of incongruence that I mention
above would be interesting, but it is not critical for the authors to prove their point.
2. The puzzle underlying the mutational basis for their extreme cases of overdispersion
I believe that DNAJC11 illustrates something that may be even more interesting than the scenario
that the authors postulate. I’d like to start by considering two limits on the rate of accumulation
of non-synonymous substitutions given that the authors state that the relevant branch in the
species tree has a very short synonymous length (dS = 0.004).
Let’s begin with what I’ll call the “neutral limit.” There are there are 1515 sites in the alignment (I
am using gap free sites, but the total number of sites is not much larger). If we assume the
number of synonymous sites is ~1/3 of the total number of the expected number of synonymous
15
substitutions for that branch is ~2. If we assume synonymous sites are selectively neutral the rate
of accumulation for synonymous substitutions is the mutation rate (Kimura 1968). Obviously,
many non-synonymous sites will be subject to purifying selection but this dS would imply that, if
all non-synonymous sites were selectively neutral (i.e., if dN/dS = 1.0), that the expected number
of non-synonymous substitutions is only ~4. However, the authors observed 39 non-synonymous
substitutions in this locus; the probability of this many non-synonymous substitutions when the
expected number of substitutions if we assume a Poisson process is extremely low. Of course, the
authors would reply “that is our point” to this description of the “neutral limit.” However, my
point in articulating this to place a lower limit on the number of non-synonymous substitutions
that it is reasonable to expect if selection for changes at individual sites is relatively weak; the
expectation given neutrality provides that lower limit. I would add that this “neutral limit” is
really just a restatement of the authors’ null hypothesis; in fact, they stated that they “…assumed
the neutral null model (dN=dS)” and emphasized that this will make “…it possible to detect only
the longest and the fastests[sic] bursts.”
Another way of articulating the fact that the authors’ method can “…detect only the longest and
the fastests[sic] bursts” is to say that the non-synonymous substitutions must be subject to strong
selection. However, this need for strong selection on new non-synonymous variants brings us to
a different limit that I’ll call the “Hill-Robertson limit.” If we assume the selection for individual
non-synonymous changes is strong then those alleles should be fixed rapidly. This would tend to
eliminate other alleles, even if those other alleles are advantageous relative to the ancestral allele.
This is just a restatement of the well-known Hill & Robertson (1966) effect. Given Hill-Robertson
interference one must assume that a large number of potential non-synonymous changes become
advantageous and then occur successively. In other words, Hill-Robertson interference requires
one to postulate the following scenario: 1) a new advantageous mutation enters the population; 2)
the new mutation becomes fixed in the (metaphorical) blink of an eye; 3) another advantageous
mutation enters the population (in the background of newly fixed advantageous allele); and 4)
this cycle repeats for a total of 39 times. Moreover, even if on imagines an environmental shift
occurs that favors specific substitutions at >30 sites one would think that epistatic interactions
among sites within the protein would create issues (though I suppose one could also argue that
epistasis might create new “opportunities” for changes that are subject to positive selection).
Perhaps there are parts of parameter space (i.e., mutation rate, generation time, effective
population size, selection coefficients on individual sites, etc.) where this can occur. But it seems
to me that the “good” part of parameter space might be very small.
I can see two ways out of the narrow space created by these two limits: 1) recombination rates are
high enough to overcome Hill-Robertson interference; or 2) the mutation that generated these
non-synonymous changes altered multiple sites. The first explanation would probably require
that there is a reasonable rate of recombination between sites that are ~10 bp apart (some of the
amino acid substitutions uniting the group defined by shading in Fig. 1 are 2-3 amino acids
apart). The second might imply that only a subset of the non-synonymous substitutions are
advantageous; the remainder were simply “dragged” to fixation by the advantageous change(s).
Both possibilities are interesting. It is debatable whether this argument applies to all of their
examples, but the authors were looking for exceptional outcomes. Perhaps the exceptional
outcomes indicate that surprising molecular mechanisms exist.
Finally, the authors should fix the misspelling of “fastest” indicated above using “[sic]”.
3. The base composition of synonymous sites
dS can be underestimated when there is strong codon bias (Rabinowicz et al. 1999). The authors
should present the base composition (and variation among loci in their base composition) for the
data used to calculate dS.
16
4. The location of non-synonymous substitutions
The secondary structure of the Catarrhini PKR sequences is shown but the secondary structure of
the DNAJC11 sequences is not shown. I’m not convinced that presenting the secondary structure
is important unless other information is provided, but the authors should be consistent. It is more
important to indicate the locations of the substitutions relative to the boundaries of protein
domains, which the authors do for PKR. It would be good to do this for DNAJC11 as well; for
example, how many of the 39 substitutions are located in the J domain?
Finally, there are two words that should be fixed in the Fig. 3 legend: “others” and “in”. I have
indicated them in CAPS below:
“Fig. 3. Alignment of PKR genes of Catarrhini (fragments) containing 18 nonsynonymous
substitutions on the internal edge ancestral to Macaca mulatta and Macaca fascicularis. The
majority of substitutions (14) occurred in the kinase domain of the protein, the OTHERS fall IN
the dsRNA binding motif (DRBM1). Alleles derived in the adaptive burst are shown in bold.”
5. Data accessibility
I was unable to access the Dryad data package. Assuming that it is made available and includes
(at a minimum) the following:
1) Nucleotide sequence alignments of the loci they examined (ideally all sequences) in a readily
usable format (e.g., nexus or relaxed phylip).
2) The phylogenetic trees they used for their analyses in newick format.
3) The gene names and functional annotations (especially the blast2GO data for the amphipods).
I think it will be appropriate.
I would like to emphasize, despite the fact that I wrote a long review pointing out issues, that I
am enthusiastic about this manuscript. I think the authors have presented good evidence for their
central assertion that there were adaptive bursts occur in small numbers of proteins. Thus, I
believe the science is sound. I also think their conclusions are of broad interest.
I hope the authors and editor find these comments helpful.

I feel my concerns have largely been addressed. However, I still worry about the 'monstrous hit'.
This is such an extreme case that it needs to be treated with great caution, particularly since it is
mitochondrial-associated, which raises the possibility of contamination from homologous
transcripts from related genes (nuclear vs mtDNA copies / paternally inherited mtDNA etc.). I
realise that there has been filtering by dS value but wonder whether this is enough.
Mitochondrial sequences have highly polarised based frequencies which could greatly reduce dS
values relative to a naive JK model. For me, more analysis is needed, for example by including a
tree based synonymous substitutions for the gene that will hopefully by concordant with the
overall tree, yet diverge strongly from an equivalent tree based on non-synonymous changes.
Extreme observations require extreme support before they can be taken seriously. This is
particularly true when the extreme observation is one of very few similar observations.

I feel my concerns have largely been addressed. However, I still worry about the 'monstrous hit'.
This is such an extreme case that it needs to be treated with great caution, particularly since it is
mitochondrial-associated, which raises the possibility of contamination from homologous
transcripts from related genes (nuclear vs mtDNA copies / paternally inherited mtDNA etc.). I
realise that there has been filtering by dS value but wonder whether this is enough.
Mitochondrial sequences have highly polarised based frequencies which could greatly reduce dS
values relative to a naive JK model. For me, more analysis is needed, for example by including a
tree based synonymous substitutions for the gene that will hopefully by concordant with the
overall tree, yet diverge strongly from an equivalent tree based on non-synonymous changes.
Extreme observations require extreme support before they can be taken seriously. This is
particularly true when the extreme observation is one of very few similar observations.

Comments to the Author(s)
I rather like this paper though for me it tantalises more than it reveals. I feel it could be fleshed out a
bit more, particularly with regard to the biggest ‘hit’ in point 3 below:
1. There is an assertion that these are the only sets of genomes that are suitable. This may be
so, but it would be nice to hear the reasons why obvious candidates like Drosophila are not included.
We thank the reviewer for their careful reading of our manuscript. In Drosophila phylogeny, as
it is known now, the shortest internal edge is ~10 times longer than our cut-off value of 0.005.
The edges of such length do not allow to detect short bursts of nonsynonymous substitutions,
because, as the reviewer fairly notices below, the bursts become “diluted” and hard to detect.
2. I would like to see more justification for the size of the ‘burst edge’. I realise that very short
edges carry too little information and on longer edges the burst is diluted. However, unless I have
overlooked something, the figure of 0.005 seems to be presented without clear reason: is it a value
that is selected to include all short edges? Would increasing the threshold to 0.01, say, add more
edges? Was there any kind of optimisation process conducted? To me it seems rather important
because if a modest change in threshold increases the number of usable edges, this could add
considerably to the analysis.
Yes - we considered all edges with lengths (in the units of dS) below or equal to 0.005.
Changing the threshold would of course increase the number of edges, but not necessary the
number of detected bursts. Longer edges would require a larger expected number of
substitutions used in our null model, so it would be harder to identify significant excesses of
nonsynonymous substitutions on these edges. Moreover, we should be aware of multiple
testing correction, so we didn’t want to extend the number of used edges without need.
Besides that, none of the confirmed bursts is spread to the adjacent edges, so we don’t have
any evidence that the characteristic duration of a burst is longer than 0.005 dS (Supplementary
Fig. 4 of the manuscript).
3. The values for DNAJC11 look unreal. 39:1?? Really? Wow. To me this needs greater
exploration. For example, what is the dN/dS ratio for this protein in other species: is the gene
generally highly selected or does this represent a one-off event? It is also worth testing whether this
represents positive selection for change or ‘normal’ selection plus a very high mutation rate. By this I
mean it could be that any change to the amino acid sequence is beneficial (perhaps!). Alternatively,
there could be huge numbers of changes due to a very high mutation rate, and of these a small
subset is selected, but because of the high mutation rate, this is still a large number. In reality, I
struggle to see how 39:1 can work because it implies that neutral, non-synonymous changes never
hitchhike, which seems unlikely. In short, this ratio is so very extreme that I think it needs extra work
to show that it is biologically plausible / even possible.
As shown in Table 1, the overall dN/dS ratio (excluding the edge with burst) for gammarids’
proteins, including DNAJC11 protein, is quite low (0.41 for DNAJC11), indicating that there is
no excess of nonsynonymous substitutions in other parts of the phylogeny. This fact supports
our suggestion that the bursts are limited to the particular short internal edges of the
phylogenies (~0.001 dS).
This point is similar to point 2 made by Dr. Braun, and we added a short discussion of this
monstrous burst to the text. We wish there were at least 10 of such events! Hopefully, they will
be discovered when more data become available.
Reviewer: 2
We are very impressed by and most thankful for this meticulous review, which is almost as
long as our manuscript. In particular, we are happy that Dr. Braun believes that we are not
guilty of a number of sin, ascribed to us by several previous reviewers. We provide
point-by-point response to numerous suggestions and ideas expressed there and also list the
changes which we made after thinking of what Dr. Braun said.
Comments to the Author(s)
Overall, I am enthusiastic about the manuscript “Bursts of amino acid replacements in protein
evolution” by Stolyarova and colleagues. I have long been interested in the topic of overdispersion in
protein evolution and I believe the authors make a substantial advance in the field. I’d like to start my
review by highlighting a few general concerns I have regarding the writing, then move on to specific
concerns, and finish with a brief discussion of criticisms in the other reviews that do not concern me
(i.e., areas where I feel the authors’ work is solid and the criticisms are not valid).
The general criticism that I would articulate about the paper is the rather telegraphic style. Although
the material that is there is well-written and clear, there is certainly room to expand the manuscript in
a number of places. Royal Society Open Science does not have a word limit. Obviously, the absence
of a word limit should not be viewed as a license to include irrelevant information. However, the
current manuscript goes much too far in the opposite direction; I believe information that is necessary
to understand and evaluate the science has been omitted.
With respect to the writing, I would like to start out with the introduction. The very first paragraph,
which is critical to set up the contrast of gradual vs. punctuated evolution seems to be somewhat
muddled. As it is currently written, the introduction jumps back and forth in terms of gradualistic and
punctuated tempos for evolution and between molecular evolution and whole organism evolution. I
think this is what reviewer 3 was responding to in their statement that “…the manuscript attempts to
frame [the authors’] research in terms of punctuated evolution and stasis, which [reviewer 3] found
much less relevant” than discussing the authors’ work in the context of overdispersion.
Our goal in this paper is rather limited - we mostly wanted to describe the phenomenon of
rapid bursts of evolution and to only sketch how it fits into the general context of research on
the rates of evolution. Thus, we do not want to go too deep into the long history of debates
between gradualists and punctualists. Nevertheless, a number of points made by Dr. Braun fit
into our approach, so that we modified the manuscript accordingly.
Of course, the authors are correct when they responded to this by stating that there “…is no
fundamental difference between overdispersed rate of evolution and alternating episodes of evolution
and stasis.” However, there can be many causes for alternating episodes of stasis and evolution and
the causes of punctuation in molecular and morphological evolution. All of the examples of gradual
evolution are molecular, despite the long history of using Brownian motion to model drift in
morphological data (see O’Meara et al. 2006). If the authors are going to include examples of
morphological evolution they acknowledge that gradual evolution of morphology is possible (indeed, it
is often viewed as a null hypothesis).
Another aspect of the introduction that I found troubling is that all of the examples they cite to illustrate
gradual evolution are molecular clock studies; to my knowledge molecular clock studies have not
tested for overdispersion. Some overdispersed loci might be rejected indirectly when tests of the clock
are performed, but modern relaxed clock studies might very well retain some loci that appear
non-clocklike due to overdispersion. Studies that use molecular clocks (especially relaxed molecular
clocks) are not evidence of gradual evolution per se, unless those studies test for overdispersion (i.e.,
punctuation) and reject it in favor of gradualism (at least for a subset of loci). Note that there are cases
where the overdispersion hypothesis has been explicitly tested and rejected (e.g., Goldman 1994)
This brings us to the causes of punctuated evolution. At the morphological level it seems likely to me
that most examples of punctuation reflect selection. This is really what the authors are looking for at
the molecular level. However, there are causes of punctuation at the molecular level that reflect
neutral evolution rather than selection. The authors acknowledge one of these explanations: gene
conversion. However, the authors do not appear to acknowledge that one of explanation for
punctuated molecular evolution offered in the Pagel et al. (2006) study that they cite. Specifically,
Pagel et al. (2006) stated that if “…speciation is associated with small founder populations and if
genetic isolation is maintained, evolutionary rates can be accelerated at potentially all loci, because
the number of loci with alleles governed by drift (neutral plus nearly neutral) is increased.” In other
words, Pagel et al. (2006) appear to favor a nearly neutral theory explanation for punctuation. Of
course, Pagel et al. (2006) do offer selection as an alternative, stating that a “…second general
mechanism for divergence is adaptive evolution as species invade new niches.” The latter mechanism
is the obviously what the authors hope to detect, but it is important that they set up the alternatives
carefully.
We plagiarized one sentence from the review (“there can be many causes for alternating
episodes of stasis and evolution and the causes of punctuation in molecular and
morphological evolution.”) because this idea cannot be expressed any better, and inserted it
into the 1st paragraph of the Introduction.
We agree that gradualistic vs. punctualistic tempos of evolution must not be conflated with the
level, molecular vs. morphological, at which evolution is observed. To avoid this, we now cite
O’Meara et al. 2006. We also added a very appropriate citation of Gillespie 1991. In contrast, we
do not want to open the Pandora box of the role of random drift in speciation (whatever this
might mean) and would rather not comment in detail on the corresponding discussion in Pagel
et al. 2006.
Overall, I really think the manuscript would be better served with an almost complete rewrite of the
introduction. As I said, I agree completely that overdispersion is equivalent to alternating episodes of
stasis and evolution. However, I did not feel that the introduction set up the analyses reported in the
paper. Moreover, the extreme terseness of the introduction (and the manuscript as a whole) has led
me to indicate to the editor that the language in its current form is not acceptable. I debated doing so
since I usually state that language is unacceptable if there are statements I simply cannot understand.
In this manuscript it is more the case that statements are too terse.
Anton Chekov famously said that “tersiness is a sister of talent”. We went over the whole text
and identified several places where adding extra text is obviously warranted - and did so.
However, we feel that our simple finding of 6 bursts of rapid evolution in two phylogenies is
better served by a laconic paper.
In addition to these problems, I feel that the authors were somewhat sloppy with their citations. I have
already brought up the issue that citing studies that use the molecular clock to estimate divergence
times as evidence for gradualism is inappropriate; evidence for gradualism requires an actual test for
overdispersion. The authors also cited the original Zuckerkandl and Pauling (1965) paper describing
molecules as documents of evolutionary history in the context of selectively neutral segments of
genomes; Zukerkandl and Pauling (1965) predated neutral theory (Kimura 1968; King and Jukes
1969). I also fail to see how Cooney et al. (2017) represents an example of “gradual adaptive
evolution”; after all, Cooney et al. (2017) state that their results “…support Darwinian9 and
Simpsonian4 ideas of microevolution within adaptive zones and accelerated evolution between
distinct adaptive peaks” (numbers in Cooney et al. 2017 quote are citations within that publication).
The statement in Cooney et al. (2017) would seem to support a “burst” of substitution where taxa
move from one adaptive peak to another. Finally, I was surprised by the failure to cite Gillespie
(1991), which I believe to be the classic text describing overdispersed molecular evolution. Finally, the
authors should make sure their references are formatted properly; I noticed that Moores et al. (1999)
is cited in the text as Ø Moores, Vamosi and Schluter, (1999); the authors should fix this and ensure
there are no other mistakes regarding their citations.
We are thankful for this important comments on the citations. We do not understand what is
wrong with our citation of Zukerkandl and Pauling (1965). Regarding Cooney at al. (2017), we
thought that their data on the rates of bill evolution are consistent with gradualism. However,
because Dr. Braun obviously knows more about birds than we do, it seems that we were
wrong. Thus, were replaced this examples with two other examples of gradual adaptive
evolution <U+200B> (Barrick et al., 2009; Mahler 2009). We also fixed the Moores et al. (1999) citations
and checked other citations for mistakes.
Once I got past the introduction I felt the paper was much better and I generally became enthusiastic.
The authors present evidence for adaptive overdispersed molecular evolution that I find quite
compelling. I only have three issues with the current manuscript; I believe all three to be very
important for the authors to address.
1. The issue of gene tree-species tree discordance.
Reviewer 3 also brought up the issue of discordance among gene trees, which the authors dismissed
as not being a problem because they “…discarded the genes with poorly reconstructed ancestral
sequences, which will be the case for discordant genes (e.g. caused by incomplete lineage sorting).”
In other words, the authors reconstructed ancestral sequences using the species tree as the
underlying topology and then examined posterior probabilities for the ancestral state reconstructions,
discarding loci with low posterior probabilities. I am not at all convinced that poorly reconstructed
ancestral sequences (as revealed by low posterior probabilities) are evidence of discordance due to
incomplete lineage sorting (ILS).
I will illustrate my assertion that “codeml posterior probabilities for the reconstructed ancestral variant
< 0.8” will not necessarily highlight loci with discordant gene trees using two scenarios. First, let us
imagine a gene encoded by a locus that has a gene tree that is perfectly congruent with the species
tree and further postulate that the gene is rapidly evolving. I would expect the high degree of
homoplasy that I postulated in this scenario to lead to low codeml posterior probabilities. Second, let
us postulate a relatively slowly evolving gene associated with a locus that has a gene tree with some
discordance due to ILS. The ILS could lead to some sites in the alignment that appear homoplastic
(the appearance of homoplasy given the species tree due to gene tree-species tree discordance is
called hemiplasy; see Avise & Robinson 2008) and the ancestral state reconstructions of those sites
those might have reduced posterior probabilities. In this example the ancestral state reconstructions
may also be incorrect given that they reflect hemiplasy that is misinterpreted as homoplasy, but I do
not think it is a given that the reconstructions will definitely have a posterior probability <0.8.
Note that this discussion is not a criticism of the chosen posterior probability cut-off; it is an intrinsic
problem with the interpretation of ancestral state reconstructions that have low posterior probabilities
as reflecting discordance due to ILS. Basically, there are multiple ways for codeml ancestral state
reconstruction to have low posterior probabilities for the reconstructed ancestral variants. Discordance
due to ILS is likely to be one way since hemiplasy does create the appearance of homoplasy given
the species tree. However, unless the authors have done simulations showing that low posterior
probabilities in codeml reconstructions are definitely indicative of discordance I do not believe they
should state they are.
Does this have a practical impact on the analyses that the authors present? I am uncertain whether it
does because I am uncertain how much discordance among gene trees exists in the datasets the
authors examined. A simple way for the authors to assess discordance is to look for incongruent gene
trees. I am well aware that error in gene tree estimation is a problem for estimating the amount of
incongruence among gene trees (for examples of my publications in the area see Patel et al. 2013
and Meiklejohn et al. 2016). However, there is a simple solution for the authors: estimate gene trees
with support values using a standard method, such as maximum likelihood (ML) bootstrapping using
RAxML (Stamatakis 2014) or IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al. 2015), collapse all branches with less than
some amount of support (e.g., 75% standard bootstrap support), and only consider branches with
support when examining incongruence. There are important statistical issues with this approach,
since there will be some errors (i.e., some branches will appear to be incongruent when they are not).
However, it is a better criterion than using posterior probabilities of ancestral state reconstructions
because the number of branches with support that conflict with the species tree is a direct measure of
incongruence. Ideally, the authors would present this information for all genes (i.e., XX% of the
branches in each gene tree received >75% bootstrap support; YY% of those branches conflicted with
the species tree) but they should present this information for the cases where they found significant
evidence for bursts.
I actually doubt that this will change their conclusions. It seems likely to me that the bursts define
branches that are present in the gene tree. For example, if the 39 non-synonymous substitutions in
the amphipod DNAJC11 sequences do not define a clade in the DNAJC11 gene tree then one has to
postulate a truly astounding degree of convergence that also happens to appear to be synapomorphic
changes when mapped on the species tree. Of course, the DNAJC11 gene tree could be discordant
with the species tree elsewhere, but that doesn’t matter from the standpoint of inferring bursts of
substitutions.
Overall, I am not convinced that gene tree discordance is a problem but the way that the authors
address it is not appropriate. At a minimum they should infer ML phylogenies for each gene with a
burst and ask whether the branch in the species tree with the burst is present in the gene tree. There
are four possible outcomes for this analysis of the gene tree: 1) the branch with the burst is present in
the gene tree and supported by the ML bootstrap; 2) the branch with the burst is present in the gene
tree but it is not supported by the ML bootstrap; 3) a branch that conflicts with relevant branch in the
species tree is present but that conflicting branch is not supported by the ML bootstrap; and 4) a
branch that conflicts with relevant branch in the species tree is present and the conflicting branch is
supported by the ML bootstrap. It is only in case #4 that discordance can be said to be a potential
problem. The more general analyses of incongruence that I mention above would be interesting, but it
is not critical for the authors to prove their point.
We are thankful for these detailed suggestions and comments on our findings. Because we
were studying rather rare events, we were concerned with the possibility of false positive
findings. Thus, we used rather stringent filtering, as far as discordance between gene and
species trees is concerned. Those bursts that we report occur in gene with absolutely no
evidence of discordance. It is likely that there is some number of bursts that we filtered out
which are real. However, we would rather have a smaller number of unambiguous cases. When
the data on genomes, instead of transcriptomes, of the lake Baikal amphipods become
available (unfortunately, their genomes are rather large, so this is probably going to wait for
several more years), we hope to redo the analysis using the better data.
2. The puzzle underlying the mutational basis for their extreme cases of overdispersion
I believe that DNAJC11 illustrates something that may be even more interesting than the scenario that
the authors postulate. I’d like to start by considering two limits on the rate of accumulation of
non-synonymous substitutions given that the authors state that the relevant branch in the species tree
has a very short synonymous length (dS = 0.004).
Let’s begin with what I’ll call the “neutral limit.” There are there are 1515 sites in the alignment (I am
using gap free sites, but the total number of sites is not much larger). If we assume the number of
synonymous sites is ~1/3 of the total number of the expected number of synonymous substitutions for
that branch is ~2. If we assume synonymous sites are selectively neutral the rate of accumulation for
synonymous substitutions is the mutation rate (Kimura 1968). Obviously, many non-synonymous sites
will be subject to purifying selection but this dS would imply that, if all non-synonymous sites were
selectively neutral (i.e., if dN/dS = 1.0), that the expected number of non-synonymous substitutions is
only ~4. However, the authors observed 39 non-synonymous substitutions in this locus; the probability
of this many non-synonymous substitutions when the expected number of substitutions if we assume
a Poisson process is extremely low. Of course, the authors would reply “that is our point” to this
description of the “neutral limit.” However, my point in articulating this to place a lower limit on the
number of non-synonymous substitutions that it is reasonable to expect if selection for changes at
individual sites is relatively weak; the expectation given neutrality provides that lower limit. I would add
that this “neutral limit” is really just a restatement of the authors’ null hypothesis; in fact, they stated
that they “…assumed the neutral null model (dN=dS)” and emphasized that this will make “…it
possible to detect only the longest and the fastests[sic] bursts.”
Another way of articulating the fact that the authors’ method can “…detect only the longest and the
fastests[sic] bursts” is to say that the non-synonymous substitutions must be subject to strong
selection. However, this need for strong selection on new non-synonymous variants brings us to a
different limit that I’ll call the “Hill-Robertson limit.” If we assume the selection for individual
non-synonymous changes is strong then those alleles should be fixed rapidly. This would tend to
eliminate other alleles, even if those other alleles are advantageous relative to the ancestral allele.
This is just a restatement of the well-known Hill & Robertson (1966) effect. Given Hill-Robertson
interference one must assume that a large number of potential non-synonymous changes become
advantageous and then occur successively. In other words, Hill-Robertson interference requires one
to postulate the following scenario: 1) a new advantageous mutation enters the population; 2) the new
mutation becomes fixed in the (metaphorical) blink of an eye; 3) another advantageous mutation
enters the population (in the background of newly fixed advantageous allele); and 4) this cycle repeats
for a total of 39 times. Moreover, even if on imagines an environmental shift occurs that favors specific
substitutions at >30 sites one would think that epistatic interactions among sites within the protein
would create issues (though I suppose one could also argue that epistasis might create new
“opportunities” for changes that are subject to positive selection). Perhaps there are parts of
parameter space (i.e., mutation rate, generation time, effective population size, selection coefficients
on individual sites, etc.) where this can occur. But it seems to me that the “good” part of parameter
space might be very small.
I can see two ways out of the narrow space created by these two limits: 1) recombination rates are
high enough to overcome Hill-Robertson interference; or 2) the mutation that generated these
non-synonymous changes altered multiple sites. The first explanation would probably require that
there is a reasonable rate of recombination between sites that are ~10 bp apart (some of the amino
acid substitutions uniting the group defined by shading in Fig. 1 are 2-3 amino acids apart). The
second might imply that only a subset of the non-synonymous substitutions are advantageous; the
remainder were simply “dragged” to fixation by the advantageous change(s). Both possibilities are
interesting. It is debatable whether this argument applies to all of their examples, but the authors were
looking for exceptional outcomes. Perhaps the exceptional outcomes indicate that surprising
molecular mechanisms exist.
Finally, the authors should fix the misspelling of “fastest” indicated above using “[sic]”.
We agree - this monstrous burst rises interesting issues. Assuming the per nucleotide per
generation mutation rate ~10^-8 (observed in a number of animals), an edge with dS = 0.004
corresponds to 400,000 generations. This leaves ~10,000 generations for each of our 39
substitutions - not much, because, in the course of this time, a mutation must occur, must be
lucky enough to avoid early random extincion (with probability 2s), and must be carried to
fixation by positive selection. Perhaps, this suggests that, from the very beginning of a burst,
selection favored new alleles at many sites, and the actual substitutions occurred in the order
dictated by availability of lucky mutations. Indeed, the probability of recombination bringing
together two very tightly linked advantageous substitutions at such a short timescale is low.
We add this reasoning to the discussion. However, a single monstrous event is probably not
enough grounds for developing a quantitative theory. Hopefully, more such bursts will be
discovered soon - and, as Dr. Braun suggests, they may shed light on how positive selection
actually works.
It is, however, very unlikely that bursts are due to complex mutations, because a complex
mutation would affect both nonsynonymous and synonymous sites.
3. The base composition of synonymous sites
dS can be underestimated when there is strong codon bias (Rabinowicz et al. 1999). The authors
should present the base composition (and variation among loci in their base composition) for the data
used to calculate dS.
We do not think that there could be a problem here. True, a strong codon bias may affect
estimates of dS. However, it can happen only when we are dealing with substantially different
sequences, such that multiple nucleotide replacements at a site were routine in the course of
their divergence from the most recent common ancestor, and estimating their number is the
key step in determining dS. Fortunately, our task is much simpler: we need to ascribe dS
values to extremely short edges of phylogenetic trees, with extremely low probability of
multiple events at a site. Thus, as long the sequences that correspond to the internal nodes of
the phylogenetic tree are inferred correctly (and we ignored cases where PAML did not infer
them with confidence, see Methods), lengths of edges must also be correct.
4. The location of non-synonymous substitutions
The secondary structure of the Catarrhini PKR sequences is shown but the secondary structure of the
DNAJC11 sequences is not shown. I’m not convinced that presenting the secondary structure is
important unless other information is provided, but the authors should be consistent. It is more
important to indicate the locations of the substitutions relative to the boundaries of protein domains,
which the authors do for PKR. It would be good to do this for DNAJC11 as well; for example, how
many of the 39 substitutions are located in the J domain?
Finally, there are two words that should be fixed in the Fig. 3 legend: “others” and “in”. I have
indicated them in CAPS below:
“Fig. 3. Alignment of PKR genes of Catarrhini (fragments) containing 18 nonsynonymous substitutions
on the internal edge ancestral to Macaca mulatta and Macaca fascicularis. The majority of
substitutions (14) occurred in the kinase domain of the protein, the OTHERS fall IN the dsRNA
binding motif (DRBM1). Alleles derived in the adaptive burst are shown in bold.”
Unfortunately, the most protein sequences of Baikal Lake amphipods are hard to annotate,
that’s why we didn’t show detailed structure of these proteins. For example, the most part of
the DNAJC11-called gene doesn’t show homology to any domains of known function. The
DnaJ domain, which is associated with hsp70 heat-shock chaperone system, covers only ~80
aa sites on the N-terminal end of the sequence. This domain has only one substitution that can
be possibly referred to the burst, however, we didn’t include it in our analysis due to gaps. So,
we can’t do any conclusions about how the burst-composing substitutions are distributed
relative to protein domains or secondary structure. We now fixed the error in Fig. 3 legend.
5. Data accessibility
I was unable to access the Dryad data package. Assuming that it is made available and includes (at a
minimum) the following:
1) Nucleotide sequence alignments of the loci they examined (ideally all sequences) in a readily
usable format (e.g., nexus or relaxed phylip).
2) The phylogenetic trees they used for their analyses in newick format.
3) The gene names and functional annotations (especially the blast2GO data for the amphipods).
I think it will be appropriate.
We regret that Dr. Braun couldn’t access the data deposited in Dryad, it should be accessible
by direct link <U+200B> https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.40vp30d<U+200B><U+200B>. It contains both
nucleotide sequence alignments of burst-containing genes (in fasta format) and phylogenetic
trees. The blast2GO annotations for the genes of the amphipods were published in the original
paper (Naumenko 2017, Table S8). Not our fault we hope - we just followed the instructions.
I would like to emphasize, despite the fact that I wrote a long review pointing out issues, that I am
enthusiastic about this manuscript. I think the authors have presented good evidence for their central
assertion that there were adaptive bursts occur in small numbers of proteins. Thus, I believe the
science is sound. I also think their conclusions are of broad interest.
I hope the authors and editor find these comments helpful.

Comments to the Author(s)
I feel my concerns have largely been addressed. However, I still worry about the 'monstrous hit'.
This is such an extreme case that it needs to be treated with great caution, particularly since it is
mitochondrial-associated, which raises the possibility of contamination from homologous
transcripts from related genes (nuclear vs mtDNA copies / paternally inherited mtDNA etc.). I
realise that there has been filtering by dS value but wonder whether this is enough.
Mitochondrial sequences have highly polarised based frequencies which could greatly reduce dS
values relative to a naive JK model. For me, more analysis is needed, for example by including a
tree based synonymous substitutions for the gene that will hopefully by concordant with the
overall tree, yet diverge strongly from an equivalent tree based on non-synonymous changes.
Extreme observations require extreme support before they can be taken seriously. This is
particularly true when the extreme observation is one of very few similar observations.
We thank the reviewer for the detailed comments on our most extreme finding. We checked
that base composition of this gene and its is not biased (26% A, 21% T, 26% C, 27% G),
suggesting that the gene is not of recent mitochondrial origin. According to the advice of the
reviewer, we reconstructed the phylogeny of this gene based on fourfold degenerate sites only
(shown on the figure below, numbers indicate bootstrap values for the corresponding
branches). Except for the branches with low bootstrap values, this tree is concordant with the
overall <U+200B>Pallasea<U+200B>gammarids phylogeny (Fig. S1 of the manuscript); the burst-containing
branch is also reproduced with high bootstrap value. Hence there is no evidence of the
<U+0441>ontamination of any kind. Still, we are reluctant to add this figure to the paper due to many
low bootstraps - which, in turn, are due to a small number of substitutions at fourfold
degenerate sites within this gene.

Keywords: punctuated equilibrium, rate of evolution, adaptive walks, positive selection
Abstract: Evolution can occur both gradually and through alternating episodes of stasis and rapid
changes. However, the prevalence and magnitude of fluctuations of the rate of evolution remains
obscure. Detecting a rapid burst of changes requires a detailed record of past evolution, so that
events that occurred within a short time interval can be identified. Here, we use the phylogenies
of the Baikal Lake amphipods and of Catarrhini, which contain very short internal edges
facilitating this task. We detect 6 radical bursts of evolution of individual proteins during such
short time periods, each involving between 6 and 38 amino acid substitutions. These bursts were
extremely unlikely to have occurred neutrally, and were apparently caused by positive selection.
On average, in the course of a time interval required for one synonymous substitution per site, a
protein undergoes a strong burst of rapid evolution with probability at least ~0.01.
