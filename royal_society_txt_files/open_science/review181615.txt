Please find attached my review of the paper “A ctenophore (comb jelly) employs vortex rebound
dynamics and outperforms other gelatinous swimmers” for consideration for publication in
Royal Society Open Science. In this paper, the authors use particle image velocimetry to quantify
the propulsive flows generated by the ctenophore Ocyropsis. In particular, the authors consider
swimming mode in which the lobes of the comb jelly are “rowed” (in addition to any flows
generated by the ciliary plates). They find that during the escape mode, this come jellyfish can
reach dimensionless speeds nearly double that of other gelatinous animals. The fluid dynamic
mechanism behind the swimming behavior appears to be representative of a vortex rebound
mechanism. Comparisons are made to the jellyfish A. aurita which also uses a rowing or
paddling mode of propulsion that seems similar to the comb jellyfish escape swimming mode.
Interesting differences in contraction kinematics and the resulting wake can be seen, however,
which explain the difference in swimming speeds. The experimental work in the paper is of solid
quality, the results are clearly presented, and the work should be of broad interest to the
biomechanics and biofluids communities.
Minor comments
1) It is stated in the abstract and the discussion that the results might inform the bio-inspired
design of propulsive systems. Some elaboration on this point seems worthwhile.
2) Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure 1 use a very similar color map for the vorticity and for the
velocity vectors. It would be preferable to use some other color scheme. It is very difficult to see
the velocity vectors in Figure 3.
3) Additional discussion of the flows generated by the ciliary plates would help contrast the
escape mode from other propulsive modes in this species and other comb jellyfish. It is likely
worth explaining further that these are ciliary fused plates rather than individually spinning cilia.

-In the introduction the authors consistently talk about the highly efficient of swimming in certain
medusa, I would like to see some values included to give this claim of efficiency some context.
-Pg. 7, Line 15 appears to be missing ‘of the’.
-Pg. 7, Line 38; ‘newly forming starting vortex as while the stopping vortex remained’, sounds
odd, consider revising.
-Pg.7, Line 56; ‘in’ should be ‘it’.
- How did the authors measure body length for the individual species? What size were the
animals that the proficiency measurements were being compared to?
-The comparison to other gelatinous swimmers is valid and interesting, however, I think that
more context needs to be given to the different types of propulsion system being looked at. i.e,
Ocyropsis may well have a maximum normalised body speed of twice that of Stomolophus
meleagris, but ecologically speaking they are completely different locomotor modes, with one
being an escape response and one being a continuous cruising style of swimming. I understand
the authors are looking at proficiency, but I feel as the manuscript is written now it is hard to
know which species are cruisers and which are an escape swim. Something as simple as an extra
line in the figure legend would help clarify this.
- In the discussion the authors talk about the increased range of motion in O. maculate being
bought about by increased muscle fibre layers. Have the authors considered how changes in the
material properties of the mesoglea might affect the range of motion achievable in these species?
-How does the musculature compare between Ocyropsis and other ctenophores that do not
perform these escape swims?
-In the videos of the swims the animals often appear very close the wall of the aquarium, are the
authors confident this did not affect the measurements?
-As a reader I would also be keen to see a video showing multiple swimming strokes at normal
speed.

ponse to reviewer comments:
hors’ overview: We thank the reviewers for their time and helpful comments. We have made
suggested changes to improve the clarity to readers and feel that the manuscript has been
ificantly improved as a result. The specific changes made are outlined below.

or comments
is stated in the abstract and the discussion that the results might inform the bio-inspired
ign of propulsive systems. Some elaboration on this point seems worthwhile.
hors: We have added some text to the conclusion that addresses how bio-inspired underwater
icles may benefit from employing the fluid/vortex arrangement that has been identified in this
y.
igure 3 and Supplemental Figure 1 use a very similar color map for the vorticity and for the
city vectors. It would be preferable to use some other color scheme. It is very difficult to see
velocity vectors in Figure 3.
hors: We have gone back to the figure data and played around with several other color
mes in Lavision’s DaVis software program and they all give similar looking results. We also
d to make the vectors thicker and more pronounced as well as making all the vectors a unicolor
k shade. This resulted in the obscuring of the vorticity color palette (which is the main focus of
figure). Ultimately, we feel the problem of clearly seeing the vector field was mostly likely the
lt of the low resolution of the figure in the initial submission. We have replaced all figures in
revision with high resolution copies and feel that this resolves the issue with not being able to
rly resolve the velocity vectors.
dditional discussion of the flows generated by the ciliary plates would help contrast the
ape mode from other propulsive modes in this species and other comb jellyfish. It is likely
th explaining further that these are ciliary fused plates rather than individually spinning cilia.
hors: we have added text in the first paragraph of the discussion that reflects the reviewer’s
ment about clarity of the cilia-based mode locomotion found in all ctenophores, including
ropsis.
iewer: 2
ments to the Author(s)
or;
the introduction the authors consistently talk about the highly efficient of swimming in
ain medusa, I would like to see some values included to give this claim of efficiency some
text.
hors: We have added that jellyfish can achieve energetic swimming efficiencies as low as 0.3 J
m-1 to the second paragraph of the introduction.
. 7, Line 15 appears to be missing ‘of the’.
hors: Fixed.
. 7, Line 38; ‘newly forming starting vortex as while the stopping vortex remained’, sounds
, consider revising.
hors: This sentence has been reworded.
.7, Line 56; ‘in’ should be ‘it’.
hors: Fixed.
ow did the authors measure body length for the individual species? What size were the
mals that the proficiency measurements were being compared to?
hors: We have added details to the methods to clarify the point that body size was measured
he longest axis and length data on all species is available in the online data depository.
e comparison to other gelatinous swimmers is valid and interesting, however, I think that
e context needs to be given to the different types of propulsion system being looked at. i.e,
ropsis may well have a maximum normalised body speed of twice that of Stomolophus
eagris, but ecologically speaking they are completely different locomotor modes, with one
g an escape response and one being a continuous cruising style of swimming. I understand
authors are looking at proficiency, but I feel as the manuscript is written now it is hard to
w which species are cruisers and which are an escape swim. Something as simple as an extra
in the figure legend would help clarify this.
hors: We appreciate this point and as suggested have added a line to the figure legend for
ity.
the discussion the authors talk about the increased range of motion in O. maculate being
ght about by increased muscle fibre layers. Have the authors considered how changes in the
erial properties of the mesoglea might affect the range of motion achievable in these
cies?
hors: The reviewer brings up an interesting point. While we are unable to address the question
etail, we added text that speculates there could be material properties other than muscle that
w for the greater range of motion.
w does the musculature compare between Ocyropsis and other ctenophores that do not
orm these escape swims?
hors: We are unaware of any detailed physiological descriptions of oceanic ctenophores, so we
unable to provide any insight into this interesting question.
the videos of the swims the animals often appear very close the wall of the aquarium, are the
hors confident this did not affect the measurements?
hors: While some swimming sequences occurred with a small part of the ctenophore body
ewhat close to a wall, we are very confident that this did not affect any of our measurements
he following reasons: 1) We did not use data from any animals touching a wall. 2) The
mming performance for the few individuals that were close to the wall was not significantly
rent that those in the middle of the filming tank. 3) Fluid structures (vortices) that formed
ewhat close to a wall, did not appear altered or to dissipate any faster than those in the middle
he tank.
a reader I would also be keen to see a video showing multiple swimming strokes at normal
ed.
hors: Unfortunately in all of our underwater field videos (the only ones with a field of view
e enough to capture multiple swimming strokes) the animals quickly swam out of plane/focus
so we do not have any high quality videos of this.
