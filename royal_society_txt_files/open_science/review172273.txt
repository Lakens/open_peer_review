This paper reports two replication studies of an influential anticipatory looking paradigm to test
children’s and adults‘ spontaneous/implicit Theory of Mind.
The paper is well written, the results are very interesting, and the paper is timely since it nicely
fits into a growing body of evidence from replication studies on implicit Theory of Mind. For all
of these reasons, I would strongly recommend publication.
Some modifications are required, however, beforehand:
• Most fundamentally, the paper fails to cite the above-mentioned growing body of evidence
from similar replication studies (see many papers in a special issue of Cognitive Development
forthcoming including Burnside et al.; Kulke et al., Paulus et al., Priewasser et al. ; see also Kulke
& Rakoczy, 2018 for an overview of unpublished non-replications and an attempt to get at the
file-drawer problem). This is very unfortunate for various reasons, among that that most of these
studies nicely converge (in casting doubt on the robustness of these measures) and thus together
present an even more impressive picture than individual findings alone.
• I think in Study 1, the two other conditions should at least be reported in supplementary
material. In a sense, they may serve as manipulation checks whether the general procedure
works.

Reviewer: Heather Ferguson, University of Kent
This manuscript presents a clear and interesting investigation of the robustness and
3
generalizability of spontaneous false belief sensitivity in young infants. All data are open access,
and Experiment 2 was pre-registered to replicate the original (Southgate et al., 2007) study as
closely as possible.
The findings are consistent with new data that has shown mixed results for replicability in this
paradigm, summarised across 24 published and unpublished studies (Kulke & Rakoczy, 2018,
Data in Brief), and with a recent failed replication attempt of this paradigm in children and older
adults (Kulke et al., in press, Cognitive Development). In fact, the summary of data reported in
Kulke & Rakoczy shows that while an equal number of studies have replicated/failed to replicate
the original paradigm, only the successful replication studies have been published. The current
data therefore makes an important contribution to the field in providing a balanced view of the
validity and generalizability of implicit ToM, particularly in very young children. Given this
rapidly evolving evidence-base for replicating the implicit false belief task in infants, it would be
useful for the authors to extend their literature review and interpretation to include discussion of
these two more recent papers (note: Kulke et al. match their timings to Southgate et al.- i.e. a 1s
cue- and still fail to replicate effects).
The biggest issue in evaluating this study is the very high number of exclusions, largely due to
participants’ failure to anticipate the actor’s action in the second familiarisation trial- 58.4% in
Experiment 1, and 65.4% in Experiment 2 (25.2% for adults). Excluding such high numbers of
participants meant that the number of participants fell short of the planned target N for infants,
leaving N = 20 for Experiment 1, and N = 17 in Experiment 2 (planned target = 50), and thus
sample size and power was very low for the main analyses (even lower for follow-up analyses).
These exclusion rates are double those seen in Southgate et al. (~33% exclusions), but in line with
those reported in Kulke et al. (in press; 47.8% exclusions identified by ‘Senju’s criterion’). Thus as
the authors here point out, they likely demonstrate a fundamental problem with this paradigm,
which is discussed in the General Discussion. The authors address this low power issue, and
provide further evidence for a failed replication, by reporting exploratory analyses of the implicit
measures for the full dataset in addition to the redacted one in Experiment 2. It would be useful
for the authors to supplement these analyses with stats that test for any baseline differences in
looking behaviour between those children that passed/failed the original exclusion criteria (or
include that as a variable?).
Given the results from these two studies, the authors rightly conclude that implicit ToM biases
may be too small to be meaningfully observed using an anticipatory looking paradigm in 25
month olds, and hence are of uncertain theoretical significance. Crucially, methodological
differences between studies are largely responsible for varying effects seen across studies. These
conclusions make an important contribution to the literature, and set out testable manipulations
for future study.
Small comments:
• “…showed that already 25-month-old children proactively predict…” – suggest update
grammar to, “…showed that at 25 months old, children already proactively predict…”
• “To make a long story short” is a bit too colloquial, could it be rephrased as, “In brief,”
• When condition acronyms are introduced (page 2) please could you explicitly spell out what
the letters represent (e.g. ‘KC’ is defined as “the person witnessed the transfer and the removal
and therefore knew that the object had disappeared”, so is KC “Knowing Condition”?)
• Please add info on gender split of participants for each study/age group.
• I note that in the current study, the infants were tested with a teacher (Experiment 1),
independently in a high chair or with a ‘caregiver’ (Experiment 2), while in Southgate et al. a
parent was always present. Could the authors comment on whether these differences in caregiver
familiarity (and thus how relaxed the child felt during the procedure) might have influenced
infants’ looking behaviour at all?

It was a pleasure to read this replication study of the Southgate et al. (2007) spontaneous false
belief paradigm. This is an area of significant theoretical interest and this paper is a helpful and
timely addition to the literature. The authors are thorough and clear in their descriptions and
analysis. The inclusion of both a 'loose' and a 'tight' replication study adds weight to the
arguments made. The discussion of possible reasons for the high number of excluded
participants provides the field with future directions for clarification of the existing literature.
I have very little to add - the following suggestions would perhaps make the paper even
stronger?
For consistency, it would be helpful to have the DLS data/analysis for experiment 1.
On page 4, line 33, you state that "This suggests that children who are most likely to have
understood that the agent wants to reach for the object, focus on the window above the last
location of the object in the test trial." Was this also true for your Knowledge condition too?
The discussion might benefit from a brief consideration of the specific implications for adult
studies, given the effects were significant, despite the high percentage of excluded data points.

sponses to the Reviewers
r Dr. Hamilton,
are utterly thankful for the positive evaluations of our manuscript and the constructive
ommendations. The reviewers' comments were very helpful and we integrated their
gestions. The main change in the revised manuscript regards the integration of our findings
h those of other recently published replication attempts. As already described by the
ewers, findings from other replication studies nicely converge with our mixed pattern of
ults and high exclusion rates. Moreover, they strengthen our manuscript by showing that
-replications and high exclusion rates are a common issue of recent replication attempts and
ing doubt on the robustness of implicit false belief sensitivity in children and adults. We are
nkful for this opportunity to share our experiences with the field and thereby contribute to
essary future efforts to further assess the reliability and generalizability of findings on
licit false belief sensitivity.
oint-by-point response to reviewer comments is attached, and the changes made are
hlighted within the revised manuscript.

nt 1:
paper is well written, the results are very interesting, and the paper is timely since it nicely
into a growing body of evidence from replication studies on implicit Theory of Mind. For all
hese reasons, I would strongly recommend publication. Some modifications are required,
ever, beforehand: Most fundamentally, the paper fails to cite the above-mentioned
wing body of evidence from similar replication studies (see many papers in a special issue of
nitive Development forthcoming including Burnside et al.; Kulke et al., Paulus et al.,
wasser et al. ; see also Kulke & Rakoczy, 2018 for an overview of unpublished non-
lications and an attempt to get at the file-drawer problem). This is very unfortunate for
ous reasons, among that that most of these studies nicely converge (in casting doubt on the
ustness of these measures) and thus together present an even more impressive picture than
vidual findings alone.
ponse:
fully agree that the recently published other replication attempts should be integrated to
ngthen our manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we (1) relate our pattern of results to
2
se of other replication studies of the same paradigm with children and adults (e.g.,
renberg et al., 2018, Kulke et al., 2017), (2) point to similar issues with other false belief
adigms (e.g., Powell et al., 2017; Priewasser et al., 2017) and (3) discuss the bigger picture
wn by the recently fast-growing body of replication attempts (Kulke & Rakoczy, 2018).
nt 2:
nk in Study 1, the two other conditions should at least be reported in supplementary
erial. In a sense, they may serve as manipulation checks whether the general procedure
ks.
ponse:
agree that the results of the two additional conditions would be of interest. However, we
fer not to report them due to methodological issues. Unfortunately, we checked the video
erials for biases only after data had already been collected. We let 10 naïve raters decide
ch of the two doors the actress will open in the critical test scenes of the overall 18 video
s. A binomial test showed that the ratings did not differ from chance in the six videos of the
condition. However, raters agreed above chance in two (FBP) and three (KC) videos out of
n the other conditions. Interpretation of the data is therefore impossible (especially because
biases were sometimes to the correct and sometimes to the incorrect door).

ponse:
are grateful for these suggestions and integrated the other recent replication attempts in
Discussion (for details please refer to our response to Point 1 of Reviewer 1 who raised the
e issue). Further, we are utterly thankful for pointing at the fact that Kulke, Reiß, Krist and
oczy, 2017 (and also Dörrenberg et al., 2018) employed the original material with the
3
inal timings, and still had high exclusion rates and could not replicate the effects. We added
aspect to the Discussion to strengthen our claims.
nt 2:
biggest issue in evaluating this study is the very high number of exclusions, largely due to
ticipants’ failure to anticipate the actor’s action in the second familiarisation trial- 58.4% in
eriment 1, and 65.4% in Experiment 2 (25.2% for adults). Excluding such high numbers of
ticipants meant that the number of participants fell short of the planned target N for infants,
ing N = 20 for Experiment 1, and N = 17 in Experiment 2 (planned target = 50), and thus
ple size and power was very low for the main analyses (even lower for follow-up analyses).
se exclusion rates are double those seen in Southgate et al. (~33% exclusions), but in line
h those reported in Kulke et al. (in press; 47.8% exclusions identified by ‘Senju’s criterion’).
s as the authors here point out, they likely demonstrate a fundamental problem with this
adigm, which is discussed in the General Discussion. The authors address this low power
e, and provide further evidence for a failed replication, by reporting exploratory analyses of
implicit measures for the full dataset in addition to the redacted one in Experiment 2. It
uld be useful for the authors to supplement these analyses with stats that test for any
eline differences in looking behaviour between those children that passed/failed the original
lusion criteria (or include that as a variable?).
ponse:
are thankful for this suggestion. In both experiments, we checked for any baseline
erences in overall gaze behavior by comparing the percentage of overall recorded gaze data
ween those who correctly anticipated the agent’s action in the second familiarization trial
those who did not. No differences were found in either age group. The results speak against
otential objection that participants who failed the criterion merely were not interested
ugh in the task, indicated by reduced attention to the screen. We added this analysis to the
ults sections of both experiments and briefly refer to it in the Discussion of Experiment 2.
all comments:
“…showed that already 25-month-old children proactively predict…” – suggest update
grammar to, “…showed that at 25 months old, children already proactively predict…”
“To make a long story short” is a bit too colloquial, could it be rephrased as, “In brief,”
When condition acronyms are introduced (page 2) please could you explicitly spell out what
the letters represent (e.g. ‘KC’ is defined as “the person witnessed the transfer and the
removal and therefore knew that the object had disappeared”, so is KC “Knowing
Condition”?)
Please add info on gender split of participants for each study/age group.
I note that in the current study, the infants were tested with a teacher (Experiment 1),
independently in a high chair or with a ‘caregiver’ (Experiment 2), while in Southgate et al. a
parent was always present. Could the authors comment on whether these differences in
caregiver familiarity (and thus how relaxed the child felt during the procedure) might have
influenced infants’ looking behaviour at all?

ponse:
Grammar and spelling was changed according to the suggestions.
The paragraph on page 2 was restructured and the acronyms of the conditions are now
spelled out explicitly.
The number of female participants was added to the description of participants for each
study and age group.
The loose use of the term “caregiver” was confusing. In Experiment 1, children sat
comfortably on their teachers’ lap and no signs of stress had been noticed by the
experimenters. Their impression was that children were relaxed while watching the videos.
In Experiment 2, “caregiver” equated “parent”. Here, the parent was always present (either
the child sat on the parent’s lap or the parent sat next to child when they opted for the high
chair). We replaced the term “caregiver” by either “teacher” when referring to Experiment
1, or “parent” when referring to Experiment 2.

as a pleasure to read this replication study of the Southgate et al. (2007) spontaneous false
ef paradigm. This is an area of significant theoretical interest and this paper is a helpful and
ely addition to the literature. The authors are thorough and clear in their descriptions and
lysis. The inclusion of both a 'loose' and a 'tight' replication study adds weight to the
uments made. The discussion of possible reasons for the high number of excluded
ticipants provides the field with future directions for clarification of the existing literature. I
e very little to add - the following suggestions would perhaps make the paper even
nger?
nt 1:
consistency, it would be helpful to have the DLS data/analysis for experiment 1.
ponse:
are thankful for this suggestion to increase consistency. We now report the DLS for
eriment 1.
nt 2:
page 4, line 33, you state that "This suggests that children who are most likely to have
erstood that the agent wants to reach for the object, focus on the window above the last
tion of the object in the test trial." Was this also true for your Knowledge condition too?
ponse:
agree with the reviewer that this is interesting information. Unfortunately, we are not able
rovide an answer as interpreting the data of the knowledge condition is impossible due to
hodological errors in this condition (see response to point 2 of Reviewer 1).

nt 3:
discussion might benefit from a brief consideration of the specific implications for adult
dies, given the effects were significant, despite the high percentage of excluded data points.
ponse:
agree that our successful replication of the effect in the adult sample warrants a more
ailed discussion. We expanded on this aspect in the revised General Discussion. We argue
t our finding, together with other positive findings in adults (e.g., Schneider et al., 2013;
uwerk et al., 2015), might suggest that the effect is more robust in older age groups. A
ent longitudinal replication study by Grosse Wiesmann et al. (2017) provides support for the
a that false belief-congruent action prediction is fragile in infancy, but becomes increasingly
nounced with age. However, our successful replication with adults has to be contrasted with
er recent replication studies that did not find the effect in adults (Burnside et al., 2017;
ke, Duhn, Schneider, & Rakoczy, 2017). From the combined inspection of these findings we
clude that also for adults, the robustness of implicit false belief sensitivity has to be
stioned.
