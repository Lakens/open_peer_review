The manuscript: Effects of CO3 2- and OH - on the Solubility, Metastable Zone Width, and
Nucleation Kinetics of Borax Decahydrate written by
Jing Chen, Jiaoyu Peng, Xingpeng Wang, Yaping Dong, Wu Li
brings up a new data about influence of sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide on solubility,
metastable zone on borax nucleation, however some findings need to be clarified in more details.
In my opinion it can be accepted for publication, but after the following revisions:
1) Authors should have explained why did they use such a high cooling rates and why is
analyzed only a narrow pH range (from 10.1 to10.5)?
2) The English style should be revised; some grammatical errors are found. It is especially wrong
that authors use word absorption instead of adsorption (also strange phrases were used through
the whole manuscript for example ..heated with the settled heating rate – heated with the certain
or adjusted heating rate…
3) On the page 4 rows 37-40 it is stated that solubility increases with mass fraction of sodium
carbonate which is not in accordance with results presented in Fig 3. In the next sentence they
claim that solubility decreases as is shown in figure…
In order to have better comparison of the results I would advise the authors to set the vertical axis
in figure 3a and 3b to the same scale.
4) Page 5 rows 27-30 I think authors need check values of enthalpy and entropy obtained from
literature, because the values cited in the text and given in the table 3 denoted with asterisk
differs.
5) Page 5 rows 37-38 …higher values of <U+0394>H and <U+0394>S , which is consistent with general
thermodynamic principles… I suggest authors to provide, cite this principle.
6) page 7 rows 48-50 The authors said that the effect of increment of the mass fraction of sodium
carbonate on borax solubility were uniform, I think this is not an appropriate explanation and
that it would be better to say that increment in mass fraction of sodium carbonate causes a
gradually decrement of borax solubility.
7) As far as I understand (sentence is not clear enough (page. 7, lines 42-45) Authors assumed that
sodium carbonate, added in the mother liquor, absorbs on the surface of the nucleus and then
suppress activities of nuclei in solution ...., - It should be explained what nuclei activities are
supposed to be; is that nuclei growth? Do they think that sodium carbonate will adsorb on the
nucleus surface or will only one of the ions of this molecule be adsorbed? It is difficult to accept
the assumption that the ions, added to the mother liquor, were absorbed on the nucleus surface
and suppressed nucleation, while the RDX pattern of the grown crystal did not show a difference
in structure compared to the crystals grown without added ions. I think the authors need to
discuss this fact in more detail.

Title: Effects of CO32- and OH- on the Solubility, Metastable Zone Width, and
Nucleation Kinetics of Borax Decahydrate
Dear editor:
Thank you for giving us a chance to revise the paper. The comments from the
referees are very valuable and instructive to correct and improve our paper. We have
suitably addressed their comments or stated our opinions, and then outlined each
change point by point. We have learned a lot through the revision process, including
the writing, arrangement, and details of the experiment. We appreciate for Editors and
Reviewers’ warm work earnestly, and hope that the corrections will meet with
approval. Revised portion is marked in blue in the revised manuscript. The main
corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s comments are as flowing:
Referee: 1
1) Authors should have explained why did they use such a high cooling rates and
why is analyzed only a narrow pH range (from 10.1 to10.5)?
Answer:
Thanks to the referee. The cooling rate and heating rate influence the temperature
of nucleation and dissolution, respectively. Meanwhile, the MZW decreases when
decreasing the cooling/heating rate. Thus, the cooling rate per cycle is the same as the
heating rate. By comprehensive consideration of the properties of the chosen system,
the stability of the apparatus and the time for experimentation, we have chosen five
different cooling/ heating rates (55 K/h, 45 K/h, 35 K/h, 25 K/h and 15 K/h). The
main aim of using the different cooling/heating rates is to obtain the saturation
temperature by extrapolation to 0 K/min of T2-R lines. It was found that the
cooling/heating rate we selected is appropriate and consistent with the actual
crystallization process.
Based on the changes of CO32- in boron containing carbonate-type brine
(Hydrometallurgy,2014,149,143-147), we have chosen the addition of Na2CO3 from
0 to 9.22%. In the study we found that the pH changes with the addition of Na2CO3.
As pH also have effect on the solubility and MZW of borax, it is suggested to study
the effect of pH.
2) The English style should be revised; some grammatical errors are found. It is
especially wrong that authors use word absorption instead of adsorption (also strange
phrases were used through the whole manuscript for example ..heated with the
settled heating rate – heated with the certain or adjusted heating rate…
Answer:
Thanks to the referee. The English style have been checked and corrected.
3) On the page 4 rows 37-40 it is stated that solubility increases with mass fraction
of sodium carbonate which is not in accordance with results presented in Fig 3. In
the next sentence they claim that solubility decreases as is shown in figure…
In order to have better comparison of the results I would advise the authors to set the
vertical axis in figure 3a and 3b to the same scale.
Answer:
Thanks to the referee. The Y-axis of inset graph in figure 3a and 3b were set to the
same scale now.
4) Page 5 rows 27-30 I think authors need check values of enthalpy and entropy
obtained from literature, because the values cited in the text and given in the table 3
denoted with asterisk differs.
Answer:
Thanks to the referee. We have checked the values and corrected them.
5) Page 5 rows 37-38 …higher values of <U+0394>H and <U+0394>S , which is consistent with
general thermodynamic principles… I suggest authors to provide, cite this principle.
Answer:
Thanks to the referee. We have added a citation.
6) page 7 rows 48-50 The authors said that the effect of increment of the mass
fraction of sodium carbonate on borax solubility were uniform, I think this is not an
appropriate explanation and that it would be better to say that increment in mass
fraction of sodium carbonate causes a gradually decrement of borax solubility.
Answer:
Thanks to the referee. We have modified as the suggestion.
7) As far as I understand (sentence is not clear enough (page. 7, lines 42-45) Authors
assumed that sodium carbonate, added in the mother liquor, absorbs on the surface
of the nucleus and then suppress activities of nuclei in solution ...., - It should be
explained what nuclei activities are supposed to be; is that nuclei growth? Do they
think that sodium carbonate will adsorb on the nucleus surface or will only one of
the ions of this molecule be adsorbed? It is difficult to accept the assumption that the
ions, added to the mother liquor, were absorbed on the nucleus surface and
suppressed nucleation, while the XRD pattern of the grown crystal did not show a
difference in structure compared to the crystals grown without added ions. I think the
authors need to discuss this fact in more detail.
Answer:
Thanks to the referee. Crystallization is an important separation and purification
process in the chemical industry. However, the mechanisms of impurities are not
completely clear. Theoretical thoughts indicate the blockade of active growth sites by
impurity molecules which adsorb at kink sites of growing crystals. This idea was
introduced by Cabrera and Vermilyea (The Growth of Crystals from Solution, in
Perfection of Crystals, Wiley, New York,1958, 393–407) and is called the pinning
mechanism. Later Kubota and Mullin (J. Cryst. Growth, 1995,152, 203–208)
expanded those thoughts by introducing adsorption isotherms like the Langmuir one
into the model.
As a critical window, the MZW was employed to explore how sodium carbonate
affects the nucleation behavior of borax in our experiment. According to the classical
three-dimensional nucleation theory, the value of solid-liquid interfacial energy <U+03B3> was
calculated by MZW data. Our results show that the values of <U+03B3> increased with
increasing Na2CO3 content when the saturation temperature and cooling rate were
fixed. Basically, a higher interfacial energy means a bigger nuclear barrier which lead
to a harder nucleation process. This proposed a possible explanation as to why
Na2CO3 could increase the MZW of borax. Besides, the addition of Na2CO3 is
unsaturated which just had influence on the crystallization process of borax and didn’t
entered into the structure of borax crystal. Therefore, the XRD pattern of the grown
crystal did not show a difference compared to the crystals grown in pure solution.
Referee: 2
This study seems to be carefully carried out. However, some minor revisions are
necessary:
Abstract; The sentence "It was found the consistent tendency---" is not at all clear.
Page 4: "the solubility of borax increased both..." it seems to me that this statement
could be wrong.
Page 4: last paragraph - it should be "according". Next sentence: this cannot be noted
from Fig. 3(b), since there is no sodium carbonate!
Page 5: Second paragraph: it should be Table 3. Next paragraph: it should be "The
calculated dissolution..."
Page 6: Third paragraph: it should be "be represented"
Conclusion: it should be "adsorbed on nuclei", not "absorbed"; third line from the
bottom: it should be "fraction of sodium carbonate was larger". Table 4, heading:
one time "in different" is enough.
Fig. 2: the formulas are misleading, since they suggest an incorporation of sodium
carbonate and sodium hydroxide, which is obviously not the case,
Fig. 3: legend-the numbers in carbonate should be subscripts.
Fig.4. legend-the 0 is also subscript.
Fig. 5 legend: one time R=55 K/h is enough.
Answer:
Thank you very much for your careful review. We have studied comments carefully
and tried our best to revise and improve the manuscript and made changes in the
manuscript according to the referees' good comments.
Please feel free to contact us with any questions and we are looking forward to your
consideration.

Kinetics of Borax Decahydrate
Authors: Chen, Jing; Peng, Jiaoyu; Wang, Xingpeng; Dong, Yaping; Li, Wu
Authors have accepted and made the majority of suggestions given by reviewers, except the
one, and that is a grammar (language) correction. The manuscript grammatically needs to be
mprove further. I have suggested many additional language corrections bellow. However, I
definitely think that authors should seek expert assistance for the correct translation of the
manuscript into English. I need to stress out that authors definitely need to improve the Abstract
since that is the most read part of the paper.
Comments by reviewer
n Abstract
Mass fraction – mass percentage
Measurements of the solubility and metastable zone width (MZW) for of borax decahydrate in sodium
carbonate and sodium hydroxide aqueous solutions were obtained.
The temperature ranges from 285 K to 315 K by means of the conventional polythermal method while
he onset of nucleation was detected by with the turbidity technique. ..
The solubility of borax gradually decreased, Over with the mass fraction percentages of sodium
carbonate in when it ranges from 0 to 9.22 %, whereas the MZW at same conditions clearly
broadened. The pH value of the solution varied from 9.9 to 10.5 according to the changes caused by
he addition of sodium carbonate. It was found that the solubility was lower and MZW was wider at
higher pH values. The nucleation parameters of borax were determined from the metastable
one data and analysed in order to explain the trends obtained why the MZW become wider.
According Applying the classical three-dimensional nucleation theory approach, it was found that the
addition of carbonate and hydroxide ions leaded causes that to the value of solid–liquid interfacial
energy, <U+03B3>, increases. It indicated that CO 3 2- and OH – ions adsorbed on the nuclei and suppressed
nucleation rate.
