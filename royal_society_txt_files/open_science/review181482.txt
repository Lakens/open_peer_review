This paper reports experiments on schooling of groups of 5 fish belonging to 5 closely related
species and studies the effect of speed, polarization and elongated shape of the shoal in relation
to the information transfer between the individuals. The manuscript is interesting and generally
well written. The description of the experiment and the analysis are sound and the results fit well
into the existing literature, and on the other hand, aiming to fill a gap in an important but yet not
so much explored area. It is also a strength of the manuscript that the authors have done the
experiments on multiple (although closely related) species rather than a single selected model. I
have only minor comments to be addressed.
The abstract is ambitious and maybe a bit too broad when speaking about groups in the whole
animal kingdom but the later parts of the manuscript refer almost exclusively to fish. The
relationship between speed and collective motion in animal groups is a hot topic and is in the
scope of several recent research papers. This further verifies the importance of the submitted
manuscript, although I miss references to some of these works as the bibliography contains very
few papers from the last few years. I would be happy to see, for example, Pettit et al. 2015 and
Jolles et al. 2017 referred. Along the same line, transfer entropy is a novel method but there are
also more examples of papers (including some of the authors own works) applying it to collective
animal behaviour as compared to what the text suggests at Line 81-83, e.g., Lord et al. 2016,
Orange et al. 2015.
The authors write in the Methods – Data extraction section that “we selected the 3 longest
continuous trajectory segments”. It is not clear to me what happened after this selection. Was this
selection done for each trial of each group separately? How was the sample size derived for the
statistical tests? Please specify it explicitly.
I’ve found as supporting data only the derived metrics. Are the full trajectories available either at
the same repository or on request? That would be essential if someone would like to reproduce
the results or calculate comparable statistics.
To summarize, this is a great manuscript and I think it will be of interests of the readership of
Royal Society Open Science ranging from experts studying animal behaviour to researchers
outside of our field. As a consequence, I recommend publication after minor revisions.

Review of the paper RSOS-181482:
Speed-mediated properties of schooling
By Kent, Lukeman, Lizier, Ward
Summary:
This paper reports on an experimental study on the collective dynamics of swimming fish, using
5 species of rainbowfish from the Melanoteaenia family. The experiments consist of free
swimming trials of groups of 5 fish in an annular swimming arena. The authors use video
recordings to discuss the fish school morphology and the information transfer within the group
as a function of the swimming speed.
Overall I find the paper poses an interesting question and brings valuable experimental results on
a subject where quantitative experimental data is scarce. I have however a few comments that
should be addressed before publication.
4
Comments:
- Much more details on the experimental setup/protocol/results are needed. I can suggest: A
figure of the experimental setup would be helpful; examples of typical tracking for each species
and why not supplementary videos showing a typical experiment for each species; a table
summarizing species name, abbreviation, standard length, speed and alignment cut-offs,…
- About transfer entropy: The specific definition used in the paper should be included (Is it Eq. 2
from the Crosato et al. 2017 paper?). Comment on the values of the local transfer entropies before
averaging (the issue of negative local transfer entropy and misinformation).
- Statistical analyses: Please include a brief explanation of the Mixed-Effects Model. "using the
lme package in R" is not sufficiently clear.
- About the quadratic fits (it should be written in the captions of figures 2 and 3 that the line is a
quadratic fit): Do the authors have any interpretation about the "quadratic" nature of the curves
in Figs 2 and 3? If nothing is said about the reason for things being quadratic we might as well
keep "increasing and decreasing trends" for Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. Actually in Figure 2 two
linear curves would fit better, with a slope change at 1 BL/s.
- Recent works by Ashraf et al. (refs below) with Hemigrammus bleheri have shown a tendency
of fish to align side-by-side and to reduce the nearest-neighbor-distance when fish are swimming
faster. That observation is different from what is reported in the present paper. Although the
experimental setups are different (Ashraf et al. impose a swimming speed using an external
flow), a comment on those papers should be included.

though this plateaued at faster speeds, likely due to the fact that there is a hard limit on how
polarised groups can be, producing a saturating effect." Please explain, what is the explicit hard
limit?

ponses to Reviewer 1
referee makes a good point that the abstract could be pared down to better reflect the rest of the
er. Accordingly, we have rewritten lines 19-20 to reflect our use of fish in this experiment.
Reviewer 1 points out, the relationship between speed and collective motion is currently a hot
c and we agree that our manuscript would benefit from the inclusion of recent work by Pettit et
nd Jolles et al. that discuss the importance of speed in mediating leadership and various group
amics. We have added these references to the manuscript on lines 41-42. We believe, as the
ree suggested, that the inclusion of these papers serves to underscore the importance of the
ent manuscript and the research presented. As also suggested, we added references to other
ks that measured TE in animal models and rewrote lines 83-88 to highlight the specific
lication of information theory in the current study and the ways in which our application differs
htly from previous work.
clarify the methods, we have reworded lines 157-158 and provided more explicit information
aining to the sample sizes on lines 162-164.
ile we have not made the raw trajectories available through the online repository site Dryad, we
e added a sentence to the data availability section specifying that the full trajectory files will be
lable upon request. Each trial is a separate .mat or .txt file consisting of 15 columns and 15,000

gh this plateaued at faster speeds, likely due to the fact that there is a hard limit on how polarised
ups can be, producing a saturating effect." Please explain, what is the explicit hard limit?
ponses to Reviewer 2
Reviewer 2 suggested, we have made short excerpts of tracked video from each species available
ugh the online repository site Dryad. This will be helpful in demonstrating our methods to any
rested readers. We have also included a table of species names, abbreviations, SLs and
ed/alignment cut-offs in the SI, with an in-text reference to Table S1 on line 100.
appreciate reviewer 2’s enquiries regarding transfer entropy and agree that our methods could be
e specific. As suggested, we have significantly expanded our presentation of how we calculated
sfer entropy and have provided the specific equation rather than simply referring the reader to
sato et al. (see the new transfer entropy section in the methods on lines 166-191). Furthermore, at
end of this expanded section we have included a brief comment on "local transfer entropies"
g positive or negative as the reviewer suggests. We have deferred the reader to Crosato for full
ils on this particular point because the local transfer entropy values within each segment are not
t with in this paper (only the averages are). We note that the reader may confuse negative local
sfer entropies with the negative average transfer entropies for some trajectory segments visible in
ure 4 and 5, and so we have added further clarification at this point in the manuscript on why such
ative average values may occur and what they mean.
referee makes a good point regarding our explanation of mixed effect models. We have therefore
ed greater explanation on lines 194-196 and provided an in-text reference to our R code, which is
lable through the online repository site Dryad (line 196).
iewer 2 also makes a good point about the need to discuss the specific quadratic relationship
rted between linear neighbour positioning and speed. On lines 282-288 in the discussion, we
e provided greater interpretation of our quadratic fit as well as discussed this in the context of the
k done by Ashraf et al. Regarding the quadratic relationship between alignment and speed, there
hard limit at 0 degrees because that is the point at which individuals are perfectly aligned.
refore, the trend naturally plateaus as individuals approach near perfect alignment with
hbours.
