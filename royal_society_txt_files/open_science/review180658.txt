The authors report the immobilization of polydopamineon ordered mesoporous silica MCM-41,
adsorbed metal ions and finally loaded the composite materials with riazolone as model pesticide
and investigated ist controlled release. The paper suffers from serious flaws. Hence, I
recomment,, to reject it. The major reasons are listed below:
1) Why is the whole introduction about controlled drug release but finally a pesticide is
investigated? Why is a pH dependence for a pestcide of importance? By the way the state of the
art is not comprehensive enough.
2) Page 2: What are MSNs?
3) The step-by-step preparation does not make sense. Why do the materials and batch sizes
increase with every subsequent preparation step? Also, all steps are carried out in solution (for
several the solvent is not even menioned). I would expect in every step a new equilibrium of all
soluble species forms. Apparently, the final compositon was not experimentally proven.
4) Regarding the textural properties there must be a severe error. The isotherms in Figure 4 show,
as expected a significant decrease of gas uptake upon loading of the MCM pore system as a share
of pores and surface area is blocked. However in Table 1 they claim, that by loading surface area
and pore volume increase. That does not make sense at all. Furthermore, pore size distributions
the Table are given for both samples with 1.88 nm. The PSD in Figure 4 shows 3-4 nm (the unit of
the y-axis is wrong as it shows cumulative pore volume while the graph shows the differential
pore volume in cm3/g/nm). It is not mentioned which method was used to determine it. I
assume BJH, as these values would be expected because the hystereses close at 0.42 relative
pressure due to a thermodynamic limitation. Hence, this method is wrong and should not be
applied. On page 8 they mention that this is „in accordance with IUPAC recommendation“. This
is basically wrong.
5) Figure 6 shows the release kinetics. First of all, the y-axes are labelled „release rate / %“. Both
are wrong. Neither a rate is shown, nor can a rate be in percent. The measured data seems to be of
low qualityas no clear trends are visible. Also, the calculated values using different models re not
scientifically sound and can hardly be interpreted reliably. Why is a positive effect of metal- and
PDA-loaded matrials described as the pure MCM-material basically shows the same behavior as
the Fe- and Zn-PDA-loaded materials.
6) Results are described on only 5 pages of text. However, 9 grants are acknowledged for
funding. There is something wrong in my opinion.

The authors re-submitted a revised version of their manuscript. A few minor comment from the
first submission have been taken into account. Overall, the major flaws in the manuscript remain.
Hence, I still recommend to reject the manuscript. In the following I comment briefly on the
author’s comments to my initial review:
1) The three papers and two sentences added do not answer the raised questions. Also, the
motivation that a pH shift by spraying it into the “acid environment in South China” is highly
doubtful.
2) Ok
3) The final composition was investigated by ICP-AES: ok! However, regarding my comment on
the batch sizes: The problem is not solved by just increasing the batch size in the experimental
description by one order of magnitude or similar, while all experimental results remain the same!
4) The only thing that was corrected was the determination of the BET values, although it is not
clear what was done differently. Now the values make more sense. The pore volumes are still
wrong. The pore sizes were just doubled (why?). All other questions and concerns about the
applied method remain the same. Even the wrong unit in Figure 4 (y-axis) was not changed,
although they mentioned it in the revision!
5) Ok. But the explanation is not satisfactory.
6) Ok. But that modification (just deleting five grants) raises the question on which basis the
acknowledged grants are selected.

Dear Editor Laura Smith
Re: Highly efficient triazolone/metal ion/polydopamine/MCM-41 sustained release system with pH
response for pesticide delivery (Manuscript ID: RSOS-180142)
Comments of Reviewer #1:
1. Why is the whole introduction about controlled drug release but finally a pesticide is investigated?
Why is a pH dependence for a pestcide of importance? By the way the state of the art is not
comprehensive enough.
Answer: The study in the sustained released system with pH responsive is useful for the pest control
in agriculture as reported in previous reports listed as below which have been added to the
introduction.
1. Kresge CT, Leonowicz ME, Roth WJ, Vartuli J, Beck J. 1992 Ordered mesoporous molecular sieves
synthesized by a liquid-crystal template mechanism. Nature 359: 710-712. (doi:10.1038/359710a0)
2. Song Y, Zeng HH, Liang YP. 2014 Progress on organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in China’s Lakes.
Adv. Mater. Res. 1010-1012, 467-471. (doi:10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.1010-1012.467)
3. Duke SO, 2011 Comparing conventional and biotechnology-based pest management. J. Agr.
Food Chem. 59, 5793-5798. (doi: 10.1021/jf200961r)
What’s more, “the as-synthesized system showed significant pH sensitivity in the sustained release
process indicating that the sustained release system can be well stored in neutral or basic
environment and activated while sprayed into earth in South China which is in acid environment.”
and “Shortly, this sustained release system with pH sensitivity is expected to have tremendous
application potentiality in application of controllable pesticide delivery with different sustained
release behavior at different pH value.” have been added in the abstract and conclusions
respectively to declare the strong motivation for our work. .
2. Page 2: What are MSNs?
Answer: MSNs represents for mesoporous silica nanoparticles. And MSNs in page 2 has been revised
as mesoporous silica nanoparticles in the manuscript.
3. The step-by-step preparation does not make sense. Why do the materials and batch sizes increase
with every subsequent preparation step? Also, all steps are carried out in solution (for several the
solvent is not even menioned). I would expect in every step a new equilibrium of all soluble species
forms. Apparently, the final compositon was not experimentally proven.
Answer: The method of step-by-step preparation has been revised and the materials and batch sizes
maintained the same with every subsequent preparation step. Because the final compositon was not
experimentally proven, the actual loading amount of metal ion was confirmed by Inductively
Coupled Plasma-atomic Emission Spectrometry (Agilent 725, USA).
4.. egarding the textural properties there must be a severe error. The isotherms in Figure 4 show, as
expected a significant decrease of gas uptake upon loading of the MCM pore system as a share of
pores and surface area is blocked. However in Table 1 they claim, that by loading surface area and
pore volume increase. That does not make sense at all. Furthermore, pore size distributions the
Table 1 are given for both samples with 1.88 nm. The PSD in Figure 4 shows 3-4 nm (the unit of the
y-axis is wrong as it shows cumulative pore volume while the graph shows the differential pore
volume in cm3/g/nm). It is not mentioned which method was used to determine it. I assume BJH, as
these values would be expected because the hystereses close at 0.42 relative pressure due to a
thermodynamic limitation. Hence, this method is wrong and should not be applied. On page 8 they
mention that this is in accordance with IUPAC recommendation. This is basically wrong.
Answer: We have revised the suitable BET method to calculate the BET surface and revised Table 1
in the manuscript. And the mistake of y-axis in Figure 4 and the relative discussions for BET results
have also been revised.
5. Figure 6 shows the release kinetics. First of all, the y-axes are labelled “release rate / %”. Both are
wrong. Neither a rate is shown, nor can a rate be in percent. The measured data seems to be of low
quality as no clear trends are visible. Also, the calculated values using different models re not
scientifically sound and can hardly be interpreted reliably. Why is a positive effect of metal- and
PDA-loaded matrials described as the pure MCM-material basically shows the same behavior as the
Fe- and Zn-PDA-loaded materials.
Answer: We have revised the label of y-axes to “Cumulative Tri release (%). Because the sustained
release mechanism of mesoporous silica was not changed by PDA decoration or metal ion
complexion, it was controlled by a Fickian diffusion mechanism in which the difference of the
concentration was the main impact accords with other common support.
6. Results are described on only 5 pages of text. However, 9 grants are acknowledged for funding.
There is something wrong in my opinion.
Answer: We have decreased the number of grants from 9 to 4 in the manuscript.
Thank you for your kind consideration. Should you have any question, please do not hesitate to

Dear Editor:
Re: Highly efficient triazolone/metal ion/polydopamine/MCM-41 sustained release
system with pH response for pesticide delivery (Manuscript ID: RSOS-180658)
Comments of Reviewer #1:
1. The three papers and two sentences added do not answer the raised questions. Also,
the motivation that a pH shift by spraying it into the “acid environment in South
China” is highly doubtful.
Answer: The study in the sustained released system based on MCM-41 coated by
PDA with pH responsive for the pesticide delivery was rarely. The researches of drugs
enter mesoporous silica with PDA coating mentioned in the introduction were used
for the reference from the synthesis methods and research thoughts. The soil in South
China was usually under acid conditions which was favorable for the sustained
released system to release the pesticide to the plants in practical use. And the previous
reports listed as below which have been added to the introduction to confirm the acid
environment in South China:
1. Song M, Cheng Z, Luo C, Jiang L, Zhang D, Yin H, Zhang G. 2018

phospholipid fatty acid and isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether analyses.

in a Cd-contaminated acid paddy soil. Environ Sci Pollut Res Int, 6, 1-9. (doi:
10.1007/s11356-017-1148-y)
2. Ok
3. The final composition was investigated by ICP-AES: ok! However, regarding my
comment on the batch sizes: The problem is not solved by just increasing the batch
size in the experimental description by one order of magnitude or similar, while all
experimental results remain the same!
Answer: I’m sorry that the materials and batch sizes increase with every subsequent
preparation step (Materials and methods 2.4-2.6) in the previous description was
wrong. This method was used to explore and improve the synthesis method instead of
used in actual research in this paper. So the methods of 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 were
incoherent in the previous description. The method of step-by-step preparation has
been revised with the actual method we used for this research in the last version.
4. The only thing that was corrected was the determination of the BET values,
although it is not clear what was done differently. Now the values make more sense.
The pore volumes are still wrong. The pore sizes were just doubled (why?). All other
questions and concerns about the applied method remain the same. Even the wrong
unit in Figure 4 (y-axis) was not changed, although they mentioned it in the revision!
Answer: We have revised the methods calculating the BET values from BJH to
Multi-Point BET. In the previous manuscript, the semi-diameter of pore sizes were
erroneously assumed to be diameter of pore sizes. And we have revised the methods
calculating the pore size distribution and pore volumes from BJH to DH. The wrong
unit in Figure 4 (y-axis) has been changed now. On page 8 they mention that this is in
accordance with IUPAC recommendation. This is basically wrong. So this wrong
expression has been deleted.
5. Ok. But the explanation is not satisfactory.
Answer: We have revised the explanation in the 3.3 Sustained release test to make it
more scientifical and explained for why is a positive effect of metal- and PDA-loaded
matrials described as the pure MCM-material basically shows the same behavior as
the Fe- and Zn-PDA-loaded materials has also been added in 3.4 Kinetics Study.
.
6. Ok. But that modification (just deleting five grants) raises the question on which
basis the acknowledged grants are selected.
Answer: National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21606262)
provided the fund for reagents used in this research. Natural Science Foundation of
Guangdong Province (No. 2017A030311003) provided characterization fees in this
research. Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China (No. 201707010473)
provided the allowance for the student which performed the experiments and tests.
Ordinary University Innovation Project of Guangdong Province (Grant No.
2016KTSCX062) provided the fees of small instrument and glass apparatus used in
this research.
Comments of Reviewer #2:
The authors have well revised manuscript and can be accepted without further
revision.
Comments of Reviewer #3:
1. The overall language use and presentation should be thoroughly copyedited by
someone with the appropriate expertise or professional scientific editing service.
Answer: We have carefully revised the manuscript to minimize the typographical,
grammatical and format errors.
2. The composition of the final product should clearly be described.
Answer: “Finally, Tri/M-PDA-MCM-41 sustained release system assembled by
MCM-41 mesoporous silica, PDA layer, metal ion and triazolone with pH-sensitivity
and larger adsorption capacity for pesticide delivery was developed which would thus
be expected to bring positive effects in agricultural fields for pest control.” has been
added to the introduction to describe the composition of the final product.
