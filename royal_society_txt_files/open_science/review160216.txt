This is a well-written and presented paper that describes a cleanly carried out experiment on
local adaptation to disease organisms in birds. Although sample size are necessarily limited, and
ideally, more than 2 populations would have been sampled, the complexity of the work and fact
that birds were sacrificed to complete the it is sufficient to explain why the study was not larger.
As a consequence, the paper represents the first experimental demonstration of results consistent
with home-field advantage in birds and is a nice contrition as a consequence.
My comments are minor and easily addressed:
1) Figure 1 needs error estimates shown with points - this will make the figure much less striking,
but accurate.
2) Earlier papers on song sparrows have provided indirect evidence of local adaptation (Marr et
al. 2008, Evolution). Placing this work in the broader context of spatial heterogeneity in selection
and local adaptation, with disease being one of several potential selective agents, would help
generalize the results to include ideas selection for multiple traits and its influence on the fitness
of dispersers. The cited paper suggests dramatic consequences for the fitness of dispersers, and
work in resident populations in SF Bay suggest correlated responses to salt concentration and
spatial distribution of birds. The BNA account for the spp cites primarily papers on migration in
the spp and suggests that resident vs migratory status will affect selection.
3) Because the SOSP populations in question share a winter range that probably include multiple
malarial vectors, some further discussion of how this may affect results, or the implication of
results for where selection acts and the variety of strains a individual might be exposed to in its
life would be useful and, potentially, make clearer the multi-dimensionality of evolutionary
problems like the one discussed.

The authors chose to study an interesting topic from the evolutionary and parasitological point of
view. To answer the question of sympatric vs. allopatric resistance of hosts against parasites and
the role of organismal dispersal they utilized experimental design, which is rarely used but much
needed approach in the field. The study is very well written, in the introduction the authors
elaborated nicely on the topic and explained the necessity for experimental validation of the
home-field advantage hypothesis. Methods and material description is (with a few exceptions)
clear, results are very well presented and discussed. Despite the number of cross-infected birds
(observations), with regards to the number of analysed interactions and factors in the GLM, was
not astonishing, an effort to obtain higher numbers would probably be excessive.
Overall I enjoyed reading the manuscript very much. On the top of the limited number of
individuals in the study, the only weak point (towards making interpretation of the results more
solid) is the lack of genetic data about host populations, e.g. on immunogenetic diversity (as is
suggested at the end of the discussion). However, inclusion of such data was probably beyond
possibilities given the highly demanding experimental design of the study.
I recommend acceptance of the paper for publication after a minor revision. Please see following
questions and comments:
1) experimental design – it is not clear which of the individuals captured in different
seasons – autumn 2011 vs. summer 2012 (Lines 108 -110) were used as donors (Lines 163-164) and
amplifiers (Lines 166-171) and which in the experiment itself (Lines 183-195). Despite sex was
used as a factor in each GLM analysis, can an interaction between season and sex be entirely
excluded? For instance vocalizing males are known to possess higher infection risk due to
increased testosterone levels and these levels may differ between seasons.
2) Despite 95% CI overlap in the Fig 2b, there seems to be a tendency towards higher
parasite loads at the beginning of the infection in sympatrically infected birds. Could lower
infection success (bird home-field advantage - resistance) be accompanied by higher tolerance in
birds, where infection was successful? Are there any examples in literature (I do not recall any by
heart). Or is it a random fluctuation associated with low number of individuals in the
experiment?
3) Lines 381-383 – please add citation to the phenomenon of cycles in co-evolutionary
interactions.

irds and is a nice contrition as a consequence.
y comments are minor and easily addressed:
) Figure 1 needs error estimates shown with points - this will make the figure much less striking, but
ccurate.
ESPONSE: We have now added standard errors of the proportions to Fig 1.
) Earlier papers on song sparrows have provided indirect evidence of local adaptation (Marr et al. 2008,
volution). Placing this work in the broader context of spatial heterogeneity in selection and local
daptation, with disease being one of several potential selective agents, would help generalize the
esults to include ideas selection for multiple traits and its influence on the fitness of dispersers. The
ited paper suggests dramatic consequences for the fitness of dispersers, and work in resident
opulations in SF Bay suggest correlated responses to salt concentration and spatial distribution of birds.
he BNA account for the spp cites primarily papers on migration in the spp and suggests that resident vs
migratory status will affect selection.
ESPONSE: Thanks for this suggestion! We have added a paragraph to the Discussion (lines 413-424),
ncluding evidence of differential fitness of dispersers on Mandarte (Marr et al 2002 Evolution) and
daptation to local variation in salinity around the Bay Area (Basham & Mewaldt 1987, Condor; Luttrell
t al 2015, Auk), to situate our work in the more general context of spatial variation in environments
nd selection.
) Because the SOSP populations in question share a winter range that probably include multiple
malarial vectors, some further discussion of how this may affect results, or the implication of results for
here selection acts and the variety of strains a individual might be exposed to in its life would be useful
nd, potentially, make clearer the multi-dimensionality of evolutionary problems like the one discussed.
ESPONSE: Good idea, thanks. We have now added some discussion (lines 358-362) of how our findings
may have been influenced by the use of seasonally-migratory rather than sedentary populations, and by
he use of vector-borne rather than directly-transmitted parasites.

recommend acceptance of the paper for publication after a minor revision. Please see following
questions and comments:
1) experimental design – it is not clear which of the individuals captured in different seasons – autumn
2011 vs. summer 2012 (Lines 108 -110) were used as donors (Lines 163-164) and amplifiers (Lines
166-171) and which in the experiment itself (Lines 183-195). Despite sex was used as a factor in each
GLM analysis, can an interaction between season and sex be entirely excluded? For instance vocalizing
males are known to possess higher infection risk due to increased testosterone levels and these levels
may differ between seasons.
RESPONSE—We now provide the full dataset on the Dryad repository (link provided in the MS) listing the
capture timing for all birds used in the experiment (including controls, donors, amplifiers as well as
experimental birds). The reviewer is correct that breeding-stage (summer-condition) males could be
more susceptible to infection, due to the immunosuppressive effects of androgens. However, this should
not influence our study results because all birds, regardless of capture date and season, were held until
ate fall (Oct-Nov) 2012, and exposed to the natural photoperiod. Thus, all birds began the experiment
on the same date and all were in fall/winter condition throughout the experiment. We have now clarified
the timing of the experiment in the Methods.
2) Despite 95% CI overlap in the Fig 2b, there seems to be a tendency towards higher parasite loads at
the beginning of the infection in sympatrically infected birds. Could lower infection success (bird home-
field advantage - resistance) be accompanied by higher tolerance in birds, where infection was
successful? Are there any examples in literature (I do not recall any by heart). Or is it a random
fluctuation associated with low number of individuals in the experiment?
RESPONSE–Thanks for this excellent suggestion. We now note this apparent difference between
sympatric and allopatric infections in the Results (lines 271-273). In the Discussion (lines 401-403) we
now raise the possibility that sympatric resistance might be accompanied by increased tolerance, as in
nteractions between monarch butterflies and protozoan parasites (new reference added to Sternberg et
al 2013 Am Nat, showing this pattern in monarch butterflies and parasitic protozoa). However, we also
acknowledge in the Discussion that this apparent difference could arise spuriously, due to low rates of
sympatric infections.
3) Lines 381-383 – please add citation to the phenomenon of cycles in co-evolutionary interactions.
RESPONSE—Citation added (Kaltz & Shykoff 1998, Heredity; now line 388).
