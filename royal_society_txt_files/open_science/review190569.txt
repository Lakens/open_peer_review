The manuscript "Testing for a facultative locomotor mode in the acquisition of archosaur
bipedality" draws upon interpretations of various archosauromorph postures from the literature
and tests whether facultative bipedality is a transition phase between quadrupedality and
obligate bipedality.
I find the manuscript to be incredibly well written and found no grammatical errors.
The biggest limitation of the manuscript is that it relies on the notoriously difficult assessment of
bipedality and quadrupedality in the fossil record as the authors describe in the final paragraph
of the discussion. I believe the authors should take this further and put in an additional table
(supplementary would be fine), that shows a more extensive version of what is shown in S1
already. A table that contains the references, the posture, and method used in the paper for
ascertaining posture (or none/figured only) would then allow readers to make their own
judgment, and allow future workers to prune the tree based on different methodologies (and be
an incredibly useful resource).
Additionally, in both figures there are some unusual ancestral states for certain nodes that I
cannot make sense of. For example, in Figure 1 (Ezcurra tree), the node between Simoedosaurus
and Cteniogenys shows just under a half the likelihood being bipedal (both facultative and
obligate around 1/4 total) when all the stemward nodes show quadrupedality, as do the two
genera. Similarly, in Figure 2, the node between Allosaurus and Velociraptor shows increasing
likelihoods of quadrupedality or facultative bipedality when the nodes below are almost
exclusively bipedal until dinosauromorphs. I believe these need explaining.

Comments to the Author:
Your paper has been evaluated by two experts, who both agree that the paper is well written and
makes a useful contribution to the literature; however, both reviewers also raise the same concern
that the main conclusions of the paper are drawn from interpretations of posture from the
literature that can be notoriously difficult and unreliable. The reviewers provide some
constructive suggestions for more thoroughly and transparently addressing this issue within the
paper.

==Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Monica Daley):
This paper provides a thorough review of existing literature interpretations of archosaur
locomotor mode, analyzed within a phylogenetic framework to provide a novel perspective on
the acquisition of bipedality. This presents a useful perspective on the inferences that can be
made based on the current state of knowledge. Considering that the authors have addressed the
comments raised in the previous reviews as far as realistically feasible within the framework of
the current approach, I am happy to accept the paper for publication subject to minor revisions
to more thoroughly address the remaining concerns.
The primary concern raised in the initial round of reviews centered around the heavy reliance on
the reconstructions by others as evidence for locomotor mode, which are based upon varied and
often unclear methods and quality of evidence. This limitation largely stands. The additionally
sensitivity analysis helps address the most questionable of these sources, but the text-based
interpretations of locomotor mode are also based on varied and often unclear evidence. It would
have been more informative and useful if the evidence extracted from the literature was
consistently based on specific osteological features, with well-stated reasoning and assumptions
about the relationships between morphology and function. However, such an undertaking may
be impossible based on available data. Despite this limitation, the paper does provide a novel
analysis and a thought provoking review of existing interpretations of locomotor mode.
However, it is hard to build upon a piece of work when it is unclear what specific osteological
evidence has informed the interpretations of locomotor mode.
In the final revisions on this paper, I urge the authors to consider providing a more critical and
thorough discussion of the limitations of current reconstructions of locomotor mode, and to take
particular care in the interpretations drawn from the current evidence. The interpretations should
make clear the uncertain and varied nature of the evidence.
As an example of some text that still seems problematic: On lines 270-273, the authors suggest
that limb length proportions are not a robust method of evidence for facultative bipedality, but
the analysis presented in this paper is not directly based upon limb length proportions or any
other consistent specific line of osteological evidence. The language of the interpretations needs
to be worded very carefully to make clear what lines of evidence are being drawn from the
current paper, and which statements are based upon specific analyses or data presented
elsewhere in the literature.
On line 254: the first sentence of this paragraph focuses on ‘facultative bipeds’, however some of
the issues raised within the paragraph on the challenges and limitations of interpreting locomotor
mode seem to apply generally, not just to facultative bipedality.
In addressing limitations of the work, the authors acknowledge the challenge of ‘morphological
proxies for behavior’ but, in fact, the challenges go beyond this. The literature-based inferences of
locomotor mode, while made by experts in the field, likely involve a broad range of unstated
knowledge, as well as assumptions that may or may not be fully supported by evidence. It would
be useful if the authors more clearly and throughly addressed this issue within the text.

eview – Grinham et al., “Testing for a Facultative Locomotor Mode in the Evolution of Archosaur
Bipedality”
s long been clear that multiple transitions to bipedal posture occurred in the course of archosaur
ution, but how those transitions took place has been a matter of speculation and debate. The
ent paper sets out to address this question by characterising a wide range of archosaurs and closely
ted reptiles as obligately quadrupedal (OQ), facultatively bipedal (FB) or obligately bipedal (OB), and
g a maximum likelihood analysis to infer ancestral states for locomotor mode across two recent
ogenies containing different (but overlapping) sets of these taxa. The results suggest that more
sitions to OB took place in the course of archosaur evolution than has previously been recognised,
also that none of the transitions appears to have involved FB as an intermediate step. These
rences are novel and interesting, with potentially important implications for the evolution of posture
locomotion in archosaurs, but as the authors note they are somewhat compromised by the difficulty
eliably distinguishing among OQ, FB and OB in fossil taxa. The authors base their locomotor mode
rminations on assessments published in the literature for individual taxa, but these assessments
widely in their persuasiveness – some are products of detailed biomechanical analysis, but many
rs are based on simple heuristic indicators (especially limb proportions) or even basically on
ition. I’m especially suspicious of determinations based solely on “[f]igured reconstructions in
lications” (p. 5, line 113), since the postures depicted in the figures seem especially likely to arise
guesswork as opposed to analysis on the part of the original authors. The high level of uncertainty
nd the locomotor mode determinations arguably undermines the whole analysis presented in the
er, and I certainly wouldn’t place much faith in the results. However, the study is nevertheless useful
owing what can be inferred (at least using a maximum likelihood approach) about the evolutionary
ory of bipedality in archosaurs based on the current, limited state of knowledge, and in highlighting
need for better assessments of locomotor mode in extinct taxa (as astutely noted in the paper). On
basis, and because the paper is so commendably clear about the limitations of the analysis, I’m
py to recommend publication of the manuscript in Royal Society Open Science, subject to some fairly
or revisions.
reasons for choosing maximum likelihood as the analytical method are explained only briefly (p. 6,
s 134-135), and it would be useful to expand this single sentence for the benefit of readers who (like
elf) are not fully up to speed on the nuts and bolts of maximum likelihood algorithms. What exactly
“joint estimation procedure”? Why do discrete character states and an “equal rates model of
sition” make maximum likelihood especially appropriate? Perhaps more importantly, is there any
on why parsimony-based methods of ancestral state reconstruction could not be applied to the data
he authors have assembled? If not, then perhaps repeating the analysis with at least one such
hod would be a useful exercise to include in the paper. It would be interesting to see whether the
lts were substantially different from those generated by maximum likelihood, or whether the two
hods produced broadly similar inferences regarding the evolution of archosaurian bipedality.
larly, it would be worth saying a little more about the decision to treat locomotor mode as an
ered categorical variable” (p. 6, line 120). I assume this means in practice that transitions directly
OQ to OB or vice-versa were treated as being less likely than transitions between either of these
es and FB. If so, the ordering scheme adopted should presumably have favoured recovering postural
sitions via FB, so the fact that no such transitions were found despite the ordering scheme being in
e seems well worth highlighting in the Discussion. In any case, I would recommend stating explicitly
ordering was handled in the analysis (i.e. what effect the ordering scheme had on the probablities
ecovering evidence for the various possible types of locomotor transition), given the importance of
issue for the paper.
manuscript is generally well-written, but does contain some minor grammatical mistakes and poorly
ded sentences. I’ve made a number of editorial suggestions below, but I encourage the authors to
e their own careful pass through the manuscript in order to ensure that the text is as correct and
able as possible.
ve some minor comments and suggestions regarding specific passages in the text, as follows:
1. (p. 2, line 20) Consider changing “humans” to “hominins”. In the following sentence, it might be
worth indicating whether the statement about FB having been hypothesised as an intermediate
state is meant to apply only to archosaurs or to both archosaurs and hominins.
2. (p. 2, line 27) Change “instances of bipedality evolution” to “independent acquisitions of
bipedality”.
3. (p. 3, line 48) Change “freedom conferred upon forelimb for use in functions” to “freeing of the
forelimbs for functions”.
4. (p. 3, line 51) Add a full stop after the phrase in parentheses.
5. (p. 4, line 65) Delete “an” before “obligate”. On the previous line, the phrase “exhibiting some
degree of bipedal capacity” is a little vague, and it would be better to mention the characteristic
that actually defines facultative bipedality: namely, a tendency to make significant use of both
bipedal and quadrupedal locomotion.
6. (p. 4, line 71) Change “dinosauromorphs” to “dinosauromorph”.
7. (p. 4, lines 72-73) Change the wording to “However, Kubo and Kubo [12] hypothesised that
bipedality arose up to six times in archosaurs more generally…” Later in the sentence, change
“to bipedality” to “with bipedality”.
8. (p. 4, lines 87-88) Change “approaches in which” to “approaches by which”, and consider
changing “addressed in future” to “further reduced in the future”.
9. (p. 5, line 93) Change “are constructed” to “were constructed”.
10. (p. 5, line 95) I assume the consensus trees referred to here are specifically strict consensus
trees and not some other kind, but it would be worth making this clear. On the next line,
“derived” would be a better word than “formed”.
11. (p. 5, line 101) Change “topologies represent” to “phylogenies include”.
12. (p. 5, line 112) In principle, I don’t see why a deep “scull-like” tail would interfere with bipedal
locomotion, provided the tail wasn’t either unduly massive or insufficiently stiff to act as a
counterbalance to the weight of the forequarters. I agree that paddle-like or excessively short
limbs are good indicators of non-bipedality, though.
13. (p. 6, line 118) Consider changing “do not deal with” to “cannot accommodate”.
14. (p. 6, line 131) Change “www.palaeobiodb.org” to “www.paleobiodb.org”.
15. (p. 6, line 135) If I’m understanding the logic of the analysis correctly, “maximum likelihoods”
should be changed to something like “relative likelihoods of the different locomotor character
states”.
16. (p. 7, line 139) Consider changing “encompassed” to “involved”.
17. (p. 7, line 143) Consider changing “examined the sequence” to “inferred patterns”.
18. (p. 7, line 149) Change “only recovered” to “only ever recovered”, and delete the second
instance on this line of the word “only”.
19. (p. 7, line 150) Looks like “OB ancestor” needs to change to “OQ ancestor”.
20. (p. 7, lines 155-156) Change “has a wider scope of species included, ranging to include” to
“includes a wider scope of species, such as”.
21. (p. 7, line 160) Change “thus” to “so”.
22. (p. 8, line 167) Consider changing “In the case of an obligately quadrupedal state” to something
like “Were an obligately quadrupedal state recovered at this node”.
23. (p. 8, lines 180-181) Consider changing the wording to something like, “…markedly with the
classically accepted hypothesis that facultative bipedality played an important transitional role
in archosaur locomotor evolution, as is also thought to have been the case in ancestral
hominins”.
24. (p. 8, line 184) Change “findings” to “finding”.
25. (p. 8, line 186) Consider changing “readily experimented with” to “evolutionarily labile”, or
something similar.
26. (p. 9, line 190) Change “link between their index” to “significant correlation between their
indices”, and integrate this sentence with the following one.
27. (p. 9, line 197) Change “musculature traits” to “myological modifications”.
28. (p. 9, line 207) Change “transitionary” to “transitional”. Also, the word “exemplar” seems
unnecessary here.
29. (p. 9, line 209) Delete “and interpretation”, since identification of facultative bipeds is really the
only relevant issue in the context of your analysis (and “interpretation” is vague anyway).
30. (p. 9, line 211) Change the wording to, “The means used by different authors to diagnose
locomotor mode have been extremely variable…”
31. (p. 10, line 212) Change “Some species are diagnosed robustly” to “For some species a robust
diagnosis has been made”.
32. (p. 10, line 214) The words “and is thus inconsistent” seem unnecessary here.
33. (p. 10, lines 215-216) Delete the words “a taxon possessing”. On the next line the words “or
landmarks” also seem unnecessary.
34. (p. 10, lines 217-221) Aside from “data on mammalian limb proportions”, the idea that greater
hindlimb length (relative to forelimb length) should correlate with a greater degree of bipedality
draws some support from the simple geometric fact that elongate hindlimbs should (especially
in a taxon with erect limb posture) make it easier and more natural to lift the forelimbs clear of
the ground. Also, it’s not clear to me why current methods should be biased in favour of
underidentifying facultative bipeds, as the text implies. I agree that more systematic methods
for determining locomotor mode are needed, but how do we know that current approaches are
underidentifying facultative bipeds rather than overidentifying them or, despite the obvious
shortcomings, identifying them at about the correct frequency?
35. (p. 10, lines 222-223) It’s hard to tell what exactly is meant by “the methods of acquisition for
this locomotor mode”. Should this be changed to something like “how transitions to obligate
bipedality occurred in archosaur evolution”?
36. (p. 10, line 232) Consider changing “contradictory” to “unexpected”.
37. (p. 12-13, figure captions) In both captions, expand “ancestral state reconstruction” to
something like “reconstruction of ancestral states for locomotor mode”.
38. (Supplementary Information) In the table of sources for information on locomotor mode in
various archosaurs, change the heading “Taxa” to “Taxon”, and in the heading of the other
column change “Diagnostic” to “Diagnosis”. More importantly, consider adding a third column
to indicate the locomotor mode assigned to each taxon following consultation of the literature.

Resubmission: Testing for a facultative locomotor mode in the acquisition of archosaur
bipedality.
Grinham LR, VanBuren, CS, Norman DB
We are pleased to present our resubmission of this article on the evolution of bipedality. We
have considered all the remarks made by the reviewers directly and modified the manuscript
accordingly. We feel confident that this version is considerably improved in terms of clarity.
We address each of the sets of reviewer remarks in sequence below in order to demonstrate
that we have taken their commentaries on board in this revised version.
Associate Editor remarks:
Thank you for your overview concerning the general quality of our manuscript. We welcome
the supportive commentaries and criticisms from the two 'specialist reviewers'. We have
addressed the issue of using unsupported skeletal reconstructions for some taxa (see
alterations of the manuscript and substantial improvements made to the Supplementary Table
S1). To address this issue, we have also conducted a sensitivity analysis (see Figures 3 & 4)
by re-running the analysis after removing taxa for which there is only illustrative material
provided by the original authors. The textual changes suggested as well as the discussion
points raised by both specialist reviewers have added materially to the quality and clarity of
this manuscript and we greatly appreciate their thoughtful input to this process.
The 'subject editor' appears to have misunderstood the context and purpose of this
manuscript. It is the case that the subject editor has a particular interest in locomotor posture
in ornithodirans because he, contrary to many other views, interprets pterosaurs as bipedal
(dinosaur-like) creatures despite contrary indications in their skeletal morphology, soft-tissue
and trackway evidence. It is the case that we interpret the three pterosaur taxa featured in
these analyses as quadrupeds, based on the most recent published, peer-reviewed works. We
respond to his various points below.
Specialist reviewer commentaries:
Reviewer 1.
Paragraph 1. Quality of writing.
We wish that this manuscript had been as well-written as the reviewer claims.
Paragraph 2. Extension of Table S1 regarding taxa assessment.
The focus on the means by which we have attempted to judge quadrupedality vs bipedality in
taxa from the fossil record is well made (and echoes our clearly expressed concerns). The
recommendation that our supplementary table includes bibliographic references, the posture
indicated, and the methodology employed to determine locomotor mode was an excellent one
and has been complied with. It has become, as suggested, a useful resource that we hope will
be valuable to other researchers.
Paragraph 3. Clarity of results and methodological artefacts.
The 'unusual ancestral states' are an artefact of the long-branches associated with some taxa
and an unavoidable product of the analytical model employed; these artefacts are explained
clearly in the revised manuscript.
We would like to thank the reviewer for the enthusiastic support for our article, as well as the
perceptive remarks that have introduced clarifications that have improved the quality and
accessibility of our article.
Reviewer 2.
We welcome the lengthy introductory paragraphs because they are not only complimentary
but demonstrate that the reviewer has engaged with and understood the importance of this
contribution and appreciates its overall context.
The comments concerning our reliance upon reconstructed skeleton illustrations is, again,
well made and was acknowledged and highlighted in our original article. We have addressed
this concern by undertaking sensitivity analyses in which we pruned out the data pertaining to
unsupported reconstructions (unsupported by a text-based analysis) and re-ran the analyses
(in both instances - using the alternate trees) using the residual taxa. The outcomes are
fundamentally the same as our original analysis (see Figs 3 & 4) and do not, therefore, detract
from our overall conclusions and the cautionary comments that flowed from this work.
We should point out that it is also a gross simplification to assume/imply that all
reconstructions are 'fanciful constructs' produced by 'artists' who have no understanding of
the underlying anatomy. In the majority of cases the original authors produced their own best
attempts to reconstruct skeletal form, body proportions and posture on the basis of detailed
descriptive anatomy. In a few instances the reconstructions have been rendered by more
skilled artists, but these are also 'informed' by input from the original researchers. It seems
unwise to, in effect, 'rubbish' all work of this type because it is actually based upon a detailed
appreciation of the underlying anatomy of these taxa; to do so detracts [unintentionally] from
the work of many distinguished scientists. Such published images have also been subjected to
peer review and found satisfactory, so it should be understood that these were acceptable for
a range of reasons at the time of publication.
Despite the understandable caveat the reviewer goes on to express 'happiness' about a
recommendation in favour of publication by RSOS.
Likelihood vs Parsimony. This was a comparatively simple choice based on the nature of the
data and assumptions that underlie of the analytical protocols: a parsimony-based approach
assumes equal branch lengths, whereas maximum likelihood allows for different branch
lengths. Maximum likelihood provides the most objective way of assessing time-based
distributional data of this kind. We have modified our explanation and re-phrased some
ambiguous wording so that the reasoning behind our approach is clearer. The questions
apparent in the mind of the reviewer were well founded and have prompted the textual
clarifications that have been introduced. In addition, we explain the reasoning behind the
joint estimation procedure used, in order to promote clarity as requested by the expert
reviewer. This level of methodological clarity is amiss in recent publications using similar
methods, and thus we believe attests to the first principles reproducibility of this analysis.
Copy-editing details. We greatly appreciate the time and effort expended by the reviewer in
adding a copy-editor-style commentary on our manuscript. The majority of the changes
suggested have been complied with (although some are now lost in the substantial re-write).
Again, the manuscript has been improved by these changes, and the inevitable discussion
between us, that the reviewer's very generous additional work has provoked.
We thank you for your attention and the detailed critiques of our first draft. We trust that this
re-draft clarifies matters and addresses all the pertinent issues that were raised.
Yours faithfully,
Luke R. Grinham

Revision: Testing for a facultative locomotor mode in the acquisition of archosaur
bipedality.
Grinham LR, VanBuren, CS, Norman DB
We are pleased to present our revision of this accepted article on the evolution of bipedality.
We have considered all the remarks made by the editors and the reviewer directly and
modified the manuscript accordingly. We feel confident that this version meets the final
requests for clarity.
In instances where clarity was requested, particularly with regards to how literature
interpretations can vary, we have addressed these within the body of the manuscript. A single
paragraph has been moved and edited to address these problems at a more “natural” time
within the manuscript.
We have expanded considerably upon “morphological proxies” and “multiple traits” in more
detail, giving significant explanation as to how these have been dealt with in other works,
particularly Maidment & Barrett 2012. Additionally, we have addressed the subject editor’s
comments regarding future directions by constructing a framework for analysis based upon
the Maidment & Barrett study. We also highlight the difficulties that would be faced applying
this methodology to early Archosauria.
We have also made the changes suggested by the reviewer.
We hope these changes meet your requests and thank you for the time spent handling this
manuscript.
Yours faithfully,
