Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
First and foremost I would like to commend the authors by saying that it is greatly appreciated
that you wish to report “negative” results. There are, however, a couple of issues which I believe
will need to be resolved.
The statistical analyses are rather vague and seem to be incorrect at some points (see below for
details).
The methodology is lacking in some very important details. The assumption is now made that the
animals from which dawn song is recorded are subjected to the light treatment. However,
automatic recorders are used so no visual observation of the birds were done. This is problematic
considering that as the authors state it themselves, songs could originate up to 50-80 meter away
from the light post. Although crucial information about light intensity at different distances from
the light post are not given it is highly unlikely that all songs recorded were produced by animals
that sat close enough to the light treatment to be subjected to it or at a minimum it is not directly
relatable to the light intensity given in the manuscript.
Although repeated measurements are made for each site and treatment there is a very high
possibility that the same individual (per species) was recorded. Considering that there are 8 sites
with each 4 treatments it could mean that sample size per bird species and treatment is only 8. As
sample size “recorder days” are sometimes mentioned which is perhaps misleading. It would at
least be clearer to mention from how many individual birds the songs originated.
Nonetheless this study may provide interesting information about effects/ or absence of effects at
low light intensities. However, it would be necessary to provide the proper data about the light
intensities to which the animals might be subjected. It may perhaps also be a possibility to frame
these results/ this study differently. Instead of speaking of how light affects (or does not affect)
dawn song, you could discuss how street lights affects dawn song of nearby bird species. Please
see below for some more detailed and also some minor comments.
Minor comments
• Title is a bit misleading if there are no effects to report. You actually wish to report an
absence of an effect
• Line 17, is your own study not an experimental study on the effect of light on dawn
song? Also L47 speaks of “most studies”, please revise
• L19-23 this part emphasizes the different light spectra, however no results are given or
discussed on this aspect
• L42-44, please note that not only the onset of dawn song is used or can be used as an
indicator for quality/ age, see Rivera-Gutierrez, H.F.; Pinxten, R.; Eens, M. 2010. Multiple signals
for multiple messages: great tit, Parus major, song signals age and survival. Anim Behav. 80:451-
459
• L45-54, This paragraph is not entirely clear to me. Are you trying to say that: effects of
light on dawn song should be tested experimentally and secondly that effects could differ
between different light colors? If so please make this clearer
• L58, is it not possible to compare dawn song at light treatments with the situation before
the lights were turned on? If there is data available this may strengthen your analyses
• L62, please use past tense
3
• L74-75, what is the light intensity at the different light colors, was this the same? Is this
average light intensity directly underneath the light post or where are these measurements taken?
Light intensity is likely to quickly decrease with distance from the light post especially when
these are situated within the forest (see also Figure S1B in Kempenaers, B.; Borgstrom, P.; Loes, P.;
Schlicht, E.; Valcu, M. 2010. Artificial night lighting affects dawn song, extra-pair siring success,
and lay date in songbirds. Curr Biol. 20:1735-17). Considering that not all birds would be within a
very close range of the light post it is crucial to include information about light intensity at
different distances from the light posts. Does this also differ between the different light
treatments?
• L77-80, all data collection on breeding took place in 2013? Please make this clear
• L92-94, this would imply that you could be recording birds which are not subjected to
your treatment at all considering that the light intensity would be several reduced in the forest at
larger distances from the light post. Again this is why it is necessary to give information about
the light intensity at different distance from the light post.
• L96, you used 62 recorder days but are the days that you recorded dawn song also
related to their breeding stage? For example in great tits the peak of dawn song in related to the
fertility of the female.
• L102-103 it is unclear to me why not simply onset of dawn song relative to sunset is
used. Which control is used? The average of that site? Or dawn song at that control of that site of
that day? When you use absolute values differences in onset of dawn song would also become
more biologically relevant as you can compare them to the “dark” control. I would therefore
advise to use treatment as a factor with 4 levels and subsequently see if there is an effect of this
factor.
• L108-110 if I understand this correctly the 14 species were first assumed to act similar to
each other and subsequently you looked at whether they might differ in reaction? This seems
backwards. It is advisable to use one model with an interaction and if there is no interaction the
main factors can be analyzed. Also what method did you use to “test” if there was an effect? Was
stepwise model reduction used? Then please make this clear. Post-hoc tests on interactions are
only relevant when the interaction itself is significant otherwise there is no reason to do a post-
hoc test. Moreover did you also correct for multiple testing?
• L112-115, assuming that there are effects of light on dawn song in your data?
• L128: it is rather strange to speak of differences in effects if there were none
• L129, this sentence should be refined a bit as even differences in species ecology cannot
explain absence of effects in all species. Perhaps something like “the absence of effects in some
species could be explained by …” would be better. You already indicate yourself that this is not a
sufficient explanation for cavity nesters close to the treatment.
• L138-150 considering the other study limitations together with the light intensity used
perhaps a more extensive paragraph about the study limitations is in order
• L136-137, you seem to refer here to results which are not shown in this manuscript. I
would advise to include these results especially as this would be much stronger in substantiating
your argument.
• L148-150, there is another important difference between this study and your own earlier
study in Behavioural Ecology. The study in Behav Eco used sites where you had forest and a road
so the edge of the forest was illuminated. The experimental setup in the current study is done
with light posts inside the forest and 1 on the edge. The importance of this has to do with the
light intensity to which the birds are exposed too which should be discussed more thoroughly.
• L125, what I am missing in the discussion and which I think should at least be
mentioned is that since there were no effects from any of the different light colors that you cannot
compare between them. Considering the aim which you explained in the introduction it is rather
strange that this is missing.
• L287, please clarify that this is recorder days and not the number of individual birds that
were analyzed.
• L289. Also clarify in the figure caption that sample size is recorded days

label_comment_3
Dear authors,
Thank you very much for this revision which I believe has clarified the manuscript quite well.
There a couple of remaining issues/comments:
L 42-44: not a major issue but not all readers may be familiar with your other work. To keep it
short you could simply add : (but see also …).
L63 would be earlier instead of “will be earlier”?
L68-69, it seems that only here it becomes clear that dawn song of several species will be
analysed. Perhaps it would be good to make this clearer at the beginning of this paragraph? E.g.
L62 for different songbird species singing near…
L78 As was also suggested by the other reviewer and for the convenience of the reader could you
not reproduce this figure in the supplementary material as well? To be clear both refer to
Spoelstra et al. 2015 but then also include a reproduction in the supplement.
L125 I understand that multcomp allows you to use adjusted P-values but different methods are
possible within the package I was wondering which adjustment is used, e.g; Bonferroni,
Schaffer,..? Because perhaps a less conservative method could be chosen although I doubt it
would change the results.
L126-128 I agree with the reasoning, however, confidence intervals seem to be only given for the
figure. Perhaps this should then be used throughout the results instead of using SE?
L136 “the dark control” instead of “control”
L142 it is difficult to see with the track changes but it seems as if the paragraph consists of single
sentence perhaps this should be connected to the next sentence then
L154-155 “advancing light effects” seems a bit peculiar perhaps best to revise
L179 their song perch
I appreciate that a direct comparison has been made with your other study (Da Silva et al. 2014)
The additional explanation for the statistical approach is very welcome.
It is good that you conclude that other effects cannot be excluded while here effects on dawn song
are not found. I very much appreciate this because it gives better context of your study and
reduces the risk of other to misuse such a study for statements such as “artificial light has no
10
effects”. While of course you do not need to write an extensive review it might be appropriate to
also mention
Raap, T., Pinxten, R., & Eens, M. (2016). Artificial light at night disrupts sleep in female great tits
(Parus major) during the nestling period, and is followed by a sleep rebound. Environ Pollut, 215,
125-134. doi: 10.1016/j.envpol.2016.04.100
Especially because sleep disruption was greater and more pronounced in the morning which
seems relevant in the context of dawn song.
Regarding behavioural/physiological effects it might also be good to refer too:

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Dear authors,
Thank you very much for this revision which I believe has clarified the manuscript quite well.
There a couple of remaining issues/comments:
L 42-44: not a major issue but not all readers may be familiar with your other work. To keep it
short you could simply add : (but see also …).
L63 would be earlier instead of “will be earlier”?
L68-69, it seems that only here it becomes clear that dawn song of several species will be
analysed. Perhaps it would be good to make this clearer at the beginning of this paragraph? E.g.
L62 for different songbird species singing near…
L78 As was also suggested by the other reviewer and for the convenience of the reader could you
not reproduce this figure in the supplementary material as well? To be clear both refer to
Spoelstra et al. 2015 but then also include a reproduction in the supplement.
L125 I understand that multcomp allows you to use adjusted P-values but different methods are
possible within the package I was wondering which adjustment is used, e.g; Bonferroni,
Schaffer,..? Because perhaps a less conservative method could be chosen although I doubt it
would change the results.
L126-128 I agree with the reasoning, however, confidence intervals seem to be only given for the
figure. Perhaps this should then be used throughout the results instead of using SE?
L136 “the dark control” instead of “control”
14
L142 it is difficult to see with the track changes but it seems as if the paragraph consists of single
sentence perhaps this should be connected to the next sentence then
L154-155 “advancing light effects” seems a bit peculiar perhaps best to revise
L179 their song perch
I appreciate that a direct comparison has been made with your other study (Da Silva et al. 2014)
The additional explanation for the statistical approach is very welcome.
It is good that you conclude that other effects cannot be excluded while here effects on dawn song
are not found. I very much appreciate this because it gives better context of your study and
reduces the risk of other to misuse such a study for statements such as “artificial light has no
effects”. While of course you do not need to write an extensive review it might be appropriate to
also mention

125-134. doi: 10.1016/j.envpol.2016.04.100
Especially because sleep disruption was greater and more pronounced in the morning which
seems relevant in the context of dawn song.

his manuscript, the authors present the results of an experimental study that was designed to test
effects of artificial lighting on the onset of dawnsong in a number of forest breeding songbirds. The
erimental design was sufficient to test for such an effect and included replication across eight
erent sites. The authors found no evidence that artificial lighting had an effect on the timing of the
et of dawn singing in any of the 14 species they examined. Line/section specific comments follow
ow.
oduction
32 – Change “night occurred” to “night have occurred”.
s 47-49 (and Materials and methods, if applicable) – You mention the confounding effects of other
hropogenic factors besides light pollution. However, you never indicate in the description of the
dy sites whether or not your study either avoided or controlled for these factors.
59 – Change “have the strongest effect” to “have had the strongest effect”.
62 – Change “expect” to “expected”.
terials and methods
76 – You refer the reader to another paper (Spoelstra et al. 2015) for a more complete description
he lighting setup you used. I found figure 2 from that paper to be extremely helpful in understanding
system of transects and light posts you used in the current study. It might be helpful to include such
ure in this manuscript.
108 – You indicate that you used treatment as a fixed effect in your models. This variable only had
e levels and did not include the unlighted (dark) points in your design. On lines 104-105 you
ntion that for those points included in one of three lighted treatments (red/white/green) you
ulated onset of song relative to the dark period. In the results, you found no difference between the
k and lighted treatments. Why not then use absolute start time (controlling for date/seasonal
erences) relative to sunrise and use all four treatments (red/white/green/dark) in your models?
s 109-111 – You mention that you used the multcomp package to correct for multiple testing. I
erstand the need to do this when making so many comparisons among 14 species. However, you
er indicate specifically how you adjusted P values. Where your corrections perhaps too extreme?
list many P values in Table 1 as 1.0. Were some of these actually higher? I see you got arrived at 42
ls of correction (line 110), 14 species across 3 levels of treatment, but is this going a little
rboard? Some amount of correction is needed, I agree, but couldn’t a happy medium be reached
re a smaller correction factor is applied? Perhaps controlling within a species, in other words a
or of 3 (the 3 treatments, or 4 depending on whether you want to include “dark”).
ussion
s 145-150 – There are some contradictory statements here. You begin here by saying that this
eriment used strong light intensities. However, you then end by saying that the light intensities you
d is in the lower part of the intensity range and much closer to light intensities with weak effects (1.5
0 lux, yours was 8.2 lux) as opposed to intensities with strong effects (21.0 – 30.1 lux).
behalf of all authors, thank you for the constructive comments
our manuscript "Experimental illumination of a forest: no
fects of lights of different colours on the onset of the dawn
orus in songbirds".
have revised the main text and we now clearly explain our
atistical choices in order to answer the concerns of the two
viewers. We also provide more methodological information such as
e light intensities of the different light colours or the
timated sample sizes. Finally, we discuss more thoroughly the
ssibility that all birds recorded may not have been exposed to
e light and we have added a comparison between the effect sizes
the current study and those found in the natural sites in our
evious study.
herewith submit the revised version and explain below in detail
w we dealt with the reviewers’ comments.

mments to the Author(s)
rst and foremost I would like to commend the authors by saying
at it is greatly appreciated that you wish to report “negative”
sults.
thank the reviewer for this remark.
ere are, however, a couple of issues which I believe will need
be resolved.
e statistical analyses are rather vague and seem to be incorrect
some points (see below for details). The methodology is lacking
some very important details. The assumption is now made that
e animals from which dawn song is recorded are subjected to the
ght treatment. However, automatic recorders are used so no
sual observation of the birds were done. This is problematic
nsidering that as the authors state it themselves, songs could
iginate up to 50-80 meter away from the light post. Although
ucial information about light intensity at different distances
om the light post are not given it is highly unlikely that all
ngs recorded were produced by animals that sat close enough to
e light treatment to be subjected to it or at a minimum it is
t directly relatable to the light intensity given in the
nuscript.
thank the reviewer for his comment. We agree that we cannot
ke the assumption that all the recorded birds were singing close
ough to the light to be always subjected to it. Indeed, some
ncluding those at the edge). Singing height may also have played
role in terms of exposure to the light. Finally, it is possible
at some individuals of those species whose songs travel greater
stances actually sang outside the light-treated area. However,
ch birds may still have been indirectly influenced by the light
ow. Indeed, previous studies such as [6] suggest that birds can
exposed to very low light levels at night and still show early
nging in the morning in highly light-polluted habitats.
ternatively, indirect effects such as social stimuli (other
rly-singing males, not necessarily from the same species) or the
ew of the light glow from the dark roost cannot be excluded. For
l these reasons, we decided to also include birds not sitting
rectly at the light in our analysis, hence the use of a
reshold of amplitude covering a distance of max. 80m.
vertheless, we agree with the reviewer that it is useful to
scuss these limitations, as we now do Lines 176-183.
rthermore, we also investigated whether excluding birds that
re singing further away would change the results by re-
tracting data for the great tit using a more restrictive
plitude threshold of -40dB. We did this for a subsample of 6 out
the 8 sites (sites 5 and 6 excluded because 5 is associated to
and 6 to 7). Using these data, we tested whether there were any
fferences in onset of singing between the light treatments and
e control using linear mixed models (including date and
mperature as control variables): there was no effect of any of
e three light treatments (mean onset of singing in white light
. control -6.1min ± 4.6, t = -1.3, P = 0.2, red light vs.
ntrol -0.2min ± 4,7, t = 0.04, P = 1.0, green light vs. control
4 ± 4.6, t = 0.08, P = 0.9).
nally, another way to test whether the birds we recorded were
deed exposed to the light would have been to put light loggers
the singing males of each species. We did it for great tits in
e Jong et al. 2016 Do wild great tits avoid exposure to light at
ght, PloS One, 11:e0157357, now [26]), but only for a small
mber of individuals. Given the amount of individual singers for
ch species this would not have been feasible, and the smallest
ggers would still have been too heavy for most species.
rthermore, the light detected with these loggers would still
ve been an approximation of how many photons are actually
tting the retina and the pineal gland of the bird, i.e., what
e actual perceived light is.
though repeated measurements are made for each site and
eatment there is a very high possibility that the same
dividual (per species) was recorded. Considering that there are
sites with each 4 treatments it could mean that sample size per
rd species and treatment is only 8. As sample size “recorder
ys” are sometimes mentioned which is perhaps misleading. It
deed, it is not unlikely that 7 individuals were recorded for
ch treatment (not 8, see Lines 110-113), because all the species
ve been recorded after territory settlement, and the recorded
ngs may thus have come from the same territorial male at each
ansect day after day. For that reason, we controlled for site as
random effect, and we pooled all species together while
rrecting for multiple testing. We now add in table 1 the number
sites for which we have singing data for more than 5 days
rbitrary cutoff to exclude rare singing events) for each
eatment to show the estimated sample size for each species. In
e legend of table 1, we now write "Positive estimates indicate
ter singing under the light treatment compared to the control,
gative values indicate earlier singing. Species are ordered
cording to the mean onset in the control treatment. Sample sizes
umber of recorded days) are given in brackets for each species.
xt to the treatment for each species, we also provide the number
sites at which the species was heard on five or more days (five
ys was chosen as an arbitrary cutoff to exclude rare singing
ents), to show the estimated sample size for each species .".
te also that we deleted the first column of the table: it gave
new information because it contained only the word "light".
netheless this study may provide interesting information about
fects/ or absence of effects at low light intensities. However,
would be necessary to provide the proper data about the light
tensities to which the animals might be subjected. It may
rhaps also be a possibility to frame these results/ this study
fferently. Instead of speaking of how light affects (or does not
fect) dawn song, you could discuss how street lights affects
wn song of nearby bird species. Please see below for some more
tailed and also some minor comments.
thank the reviewer for his comment. We now refer in the method
ines 84-86) and discussion (Line 177) sections to the figure S1
de Jong et al. 2016 ([26]). This figure shows the decline of
ght intensity with increasing distance from the lamppost, at a
ight of 1,7 m above the ground (nest boxes entrance height), and
us gives an idea of the levels of artificial light that a male
ngbird may be exposed to when singing at a certain distance from
e lamp posts. We also now clearly discuss how these low light
tensities to which the birds may have been exposed to could have
fected the results Lines 176-183.
nor comments
Title is a bit misleading if there are no effects to
port. You actually wish to report an absence of an effect
anks for this relevant remark. We modified the title to
xperimental illumination of a forest: no effects of lights of
Line 17, is your own study not an experimental study on
e effect of light on dawn song? Also L47 speaks of “most
udies”, please revise
anks for pointing this out. The experimental study you mentioned
a Silva A, Valcu M, Kempenaers B. 2016 Behavioural plasticity in
e onset of dawn song under intermittent experimental night
ghting. Anim. Behav. 117, 155–165, now moved to [19]) has been
blished very recently and we forgot to add it in our literature
view in the introduction. We thus now write Line 17 "Most of
ese studies" and Line 47 "However, all of these studies are
rrelational (except [19]) " to refer to this experimental work.
L19-23 this part emphasizes the different light spectra,
wever no results are given or discussed on this aspect
sults are given, and detailed in table 1. However, we admit that
ey were not discussed. We now discuss them Lines 187-191:
ontrary to our predictions, there was no differential impact on
ming of dawn singing between the light colours. However, given
at even the white light treatment had no effect here, and that
r experimental birds may have been exposed to low light levels
night, more experimental research is needed, either in the
eld or in laboratory settings".
L42-44, please note that not only the onset of dawn song
used or can be used as an indicator for quality/ age, see
vera-Gutierrez, H.F.; Pinxten, R.; Eens, M. 2010. Multiple
gnals for multiple messages: great tit, Parus major, song
gnals age and survival. Anim Behav. 80:451-459
agree, but we already discussed this in a previous paper (Da
lva et al. 2016, [19]). For brevity, we decided to focus here on
art of dawn song only.
L45-54, This paragraph is not entirely clear to me. Are
u trying to say that: effects of light on dawn song should be
sted experimentally and secondly that effects could differ
tween different light colors? If so please make this clearer
thank the reviewer for his comment. That's indeed what we are
ying to say. We now have reformulated the entire paragraph and
hope that the current changes are clearer (Lines 45-59).
L58, is it not possible to compare dawn song at light
eatments with the situation before the lights were turned on? If
ere is data available this may strengthen your analyses
is is an interesting suggestion, but unfortunately dawn song has
ly been recorded here during the breeding season of 2013.
wever, we suggest an alternative approach: we now compare (Lines
0-164) the mean onset times in our experimental setup with the
an onset times in the natural forests used in our previous study
a Silva et al. 2014, [18]) and show that they are strikingly
nging near the lights. We modified the formulation of the two
llowing sentences accordingly (Lines 165-174)
L62, please use past tense
ange as suggested Line 68.
L74-75, what is the light intensity at the different light
lors, was this the same? Is this average light intensity
rectly underneath the light post or where are these measurements
ken? Light intensity is likely to quickly decrease with distance
om the light post especially when these are situated within the
rest (see also Figure S1B in Kempenaers, B.; Borgstrom, P.;
es, P.; Schlicht, E.; Valcu, M. 2010. Artificial night lighting
fects dawn song, extra-pair siring success, and lay date in
ngbirds. Curr Biol. 20:1735-17). Considering that not all birds
uld be within a very close range of the light post it is crucial
include information about light intensity at different
stances from the light posts. Does this also differ between the
fferent light treatments? Thanks for this comment. We now
ecify (Lines 83-84) that light has been measured underneath the
ght posts and that mean light intensities decreased slightly
om white to green to red light. We here also refer to Figure S1
study [26] to show how the decrease of light intensity with
stance for each light colour.
L77-80, all data collection on breeding took place in
13? Please make this clear
deed, the data collection took place in 2013, as now specified
ine 88).
L92-94, this would imply that you could be recording birds
ich are not subjected to your treatment at all considering that
e light intensity would be several reduced in the forest at
rger distances from the light post. Again this is why it is
cessary to give information about the light intensity at
fferent distance from the light post.
hope we can answer your concern with the reference to the
gure S1 in [26] Lines 84-86 ("Figure S1 in study [26] shows how
ght intensities at the nest-box level decreases with distance
om nearest lamppost, for all light colours") and with the part
added Lines 176-183 to discuss whether birds have been
bjected to the light intensities: "Moreover, light intensity
creased with distance from the lamppost (figure S1 in study
6]), partly due to vegetation cover, so birds singing at a range
om 40 to 80 meters may have been exposed to very low light
tensities (less than 0.01 lux), depending on song perch. This
ghlights that our experiment may have been limited in terms of
lumination even though we had expected that onset of singing of
rds singing further away from the lights could still be
fluenced via direct effects of low light intensities on avian
L96, you used 62 recorder days but are the days that you
corded dawn song also related to their breeding stage? For
ample in great tits the peak of dawn song in related to the
rtility of the female.
thank the reviewer for his important comment. Indeed, the days
en we recorded dawn song were related to breeding stage: they
cluded the singing peak of the majority of the singing species,
d the pre-laying and laying phases of great tits, blue tits, and
ed flycatchers (see Lines 88-90).
L102-103 it is unclear to me why not simply onset of dawn
ng relative to sunset is used. Which control is used? The
erage of that site? Or dawn song at that control of that site of
at day? When you use absolute values differences in onset of
wn song would also become more biologically relevant as you can
mpare them to the “dark” control. I would therefore advise to
e treatment as a factor with 4 levels and subsequently see if
ere is an effect of this factor.
previously analysed our data using "onset of dawn song relative
sunrise" as a response variable, separately for each species.
e general conclusions were not different, but we realized that
r some species, birds sang during different periods (different
ys) for different treatments/sites. Because onset of singing is
fluenced by season (date) and by weather, this may lead to false
nclusions. We realized that the analysis is simpler and clearer
en we control for these variables from the start and pool the
ecies together. We therefore chose to calculate the daily
fference in onset between light treated transects and the dark
ntrol at the same site on the same day, which controls for these
nfounding effects. For this reason, there are no data for the
ntrol days, and "treatment" cannot thus be used as a factor with
levels in our models. We clarified this (Lines 113-120):"This is
lculated for each species, at each site and on each day, as the
fference (in min) between the onset of dawn song in each light
eatment (red/green/white) and the onset of dawn song in the dark
ntrol of the same site on the same day. Testing whether this
sponse variable differs from zero is an alternative to testing
e overall difference in onset of singing between the four
eatment groups (which gives qualitatively similar results), but
better because it allows for direct day-to-day comparisons
thin each site, thereby controlling for potentially confounding
fects of season, weather, or other local conditions that may
fluence timing of singing".
L108-110 if I understand this correctly the 14 species
re first assumed to act similar to each other and subsequently
u looked at whether they might differ in reaction? This seems
ckwards. It is advisable to use one model with an interaction
d if there is no interaction the main factors can be analyzed.
c tests on interactions are only relevant when the interaction
self is significant otherwise there is no reason to do a post-
c test. Moreover did you also correct for multiple testing?
s indeed, we first wanted to see if there was a general change
the dawn chorus of the forest songbird community before going
more specific results on the species level, notably because one
ediction was that earlier singing species are most affected. We
d not use any model reduction regarding the interaction, because
wanted to show the results for each species to discuss possible
fferences. As specified on line 125, we indeed corrected for
ltiple testing.
L112-115, assuming that there are effects of light on dawn
ng in your data?
t necessarily because as can be seen in the results, we find
at the effect sizes are more often negative (suggesting weak
ght effects) in the later species than in the early-singing
ecies (see figure 1), despite the overall absence of effects of
ght on dawn song.
L128: it is rather strange to speak of differences in
fects if there were none
agree that our formulation was not appropriate and thank the
viewer for pointing this out. We now write (Lines 142-145) "We
und no experimental evidence that artificial night lighting from
nventional white, green, or red street lights advanced the daily
set of dawn singing in wild forest passerines singing near the
ght posts, including naturally early singers".
L129, this sentence should be refined a bit as even
fferences in species ecology cannot explain absence of effects
all species. Perhaps something like “the absence of effects in
me species could be explained by …” would be better. You already
dicate yourself that this is not a sufficient explanation for
vity nesters close to the treatment.
thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We now write L146-147
or some species, the absence of effects may be explained by
eir ecology".
L138-150 considering the other study limitations together
th the light intensity used perhaps a more extensive paragraph
out the study limitations is in order
agree. The paragraph Lines 157-183 has now been extended to
corporate more information on the study limitations, following
e reviewers' comments.
L136-137, you seem to refer here to results which are not
own in this manuscript. I would advise to include these results
pecially as this would be much stronger in substantiating your
gument.
r the white-light and control treatments, as we now specify
nes 155-156.
L148-150, there is another important difference between
is study and your own earlier study in Behavioural Ecology. The
udy in Behav Eco used sites where you had forest and a road so
e edge of the forest was illuminated. The experimental setup in
e current study is done with light posts inside the forest and 1
the edge. The importance of this has to do with the light
tensity to which the birds are exposed too which should be
scussed more thoroughly.
thank the reviewer for his comment. We think that the
fference between the two studies is minimal because in both
ses the artificial light would have been attenuated by the trees
the edge of the forest. On the contrary, in our current

this manuscript, the authors present the results of an
perimental study that was designed to test the effects of
tificial lighting on the onset of dawnsong in a number of forest
eeding songbirds. The experimental design was sufficient to test
effect on the timing of the onset of dawn singing in any of the
species they examined. Line/section specific comments follow
low.

scription of the study sites whether or not your study either
oided or controlled for these factors.

terials and methods, L74-75, that our study did indeed avoid the
nfounding factors associated with cities ("Forests were far from
ban areas and thus not exposed to potentially confounding
ctors such as noise pollution, increased temperatures, and bird
eders").

rongest effect”.

terials and methods
ne 76 – You refer the reader to another paper (Spoelstra et al.
15) for a more complete description of the lighting setup you

derstanding the system of transects and light posts you used in
e current study. It might be helpful to include such a figure in
is manuscript.

nerally refer to Spoelstra et al. 2015 ([25]) in all the
blished work involving our experimental setup.
ne 108 – You indicate that you used treatment as a fixed effect
your models. This variable only had three levels and did not
clude the unlighted (dark) points in your design. On lines 104-

ghted treatments (red/white/green) you calculated onset of song

thank the reviewer for his comment. We refer to our answer to a
mment from the first reviewer. In summary, the model suggested
the reviewer leads to the same conclusions, but because
metimes birds at different treatments/sites were recorded on
fferent days and because date and weather on a particular day
fluence the onset of dawn singing, we opted for a more
raightforward approach. We compared the onset of singing under a
ght treatment with the onset of singing at the control treatment
the same day at the same site. To answer these concerns, we

nes 109-111 – You mention that you used the multcomp package to
rrect for multiple testing. I understand the need to do this

agree with the reviewer that the data correction seems a bit
o extreme because of the 42 comparisons and the high p-values.

e multcomp package. Moreover, choosing another correction level

ke it is and stress the importance of looking at effect sizes
d confidence intervals (in figure 1) rather than at P-values, or
t correct for multiple comparisons at all. We opted for the
rst option and we now write (Lines 126-128) that P-values may be
nservative and that it is important to consider effect sizes and
nfidence intervals: "Note that correction for the large number
comparisons may lead to overly conservative p-values; hence,
e focus should be on effect sizes and confidence intervals".

On behalf of all authors, thank you for the recommended publication and for the comments on
our manuscript "Experimental illumination of a forest: no effects of lights of different colours
on the onset of the dawn chorus in songbirds".
We are very grateful for the positive comments of the reviewers. We have responded to the
minor revisions and we have highlighted our changes in the manuscript.
We explain below in detail how we dealt with the reviewers’ comments.

Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Dear authors,
Thank you very much for this revision which I believe has clarified the manuscript quite well.
There a couple of remaining issues/comments:
L 42-44: not a major issue but not all readers may be familiar with your other work. To keep it short
you could simply add : (but see also …).
We are not sure about the sentence the referee is referring to but we modified the sentence L47
as possibly suggested.
L63 would be earlier instead of “will be earlier”?
Changed as suggested L60.
L68-69, it seems that only here it becomes clear that dawn song of several species will be analysed.
Perhaps it would be good to make this clearer at the beginning of this paragraph? E.g. L62 for different
ongbird species singing near…
We thank the reviewer for this comment. We now introduce it earlier, L59-60: “We recorded
daily dawn chorus of all songbird species singing near each light-treated area and predicted…”.
L78 As was also suggested by the other reviewer and for the convenience of the reader could you not
eproduce this figure in the supplementary material as well? To be clear both refer to Spoelstra et al.
2015 but then also include a reproduction in the supplement.
We thank the reviewer for this comment. As answered previously, we would prefer to always
efer to Spoelstra et al. 2015 for the scheme of the experimental setup, in order to avoid
eproducing the figure in each paper dealing with this setup.
L125 I understand that multcomp allows you to use adjusted P-values but different methods are
possible within the package I was wondering which adjustment is used, e.g; Bonferroni, Schaffer,..?
esults.
We used the "single-step" correction method of the multcomp package, as now specified L119.
Based on the literature, this method is not too conservative. Moreover, independent of the
correction method, for so many tests and non-significant p-values, p-values are bound to be 1
after correction.
L126-128 I agree with the reasoning, however, confidence intervals seem to be only given for the
igure. Perhaps this should then be used throughout the results instead of using SE?
We thank the reviewer for this comment. We would prefer to keep SEs in the table to allow for
comparisons with the SEs shown in our previous papers on timing of singing, and confidence
ntervals in the figure for the reader to directly assess significance.
L136 “the dark control” instead of “control”
Changed as suggested L129.
L142 it is difficult to see with the track changes but it seems as if the paragraph consists of single
entence perhaps this should be connected to the next sentence then
The first paragraph of the discussion indeed consists of a single sentence. Because the first
paragraph conventionally sums up the results, we have decided not to connect it with the next
paragraph, but instead to split it into two sentences (L135-138).
L154-155 “advancing light effects” seems a bit peculiar perhaps best to revise
We now write L146-147: “some species may have shown earlier singing under the artificial light
reatment”.
L179 their song perch
Changed as suggested L171.
appreciate that a direct comparison has been made with your other study (Da Silva et al. 2014)
The additional explanation for the statistical approach is very welcome.
Thank you very much for these comments.
t is good that you conclude that other effects cannot be excluded while here effects on dawn song are
not found. I very much appreciate this because it gives better context of your study and reduces the
isk of other to misuse such a study for statements such as “artificial light has no effects”. While of
ourse you do not need to write an extensive review it might be appropriate to also mention

Especially because sleep disruption was greater and more pronounced in the morning which seems
elevant in the context of dawn song.
